I wonder what it would it look like in there? Ooh yes, it would, it would perhaps I mean Exaggerate. Mm. Oh yes, I wouldn't dare ! It's been broken twice in my lifetime. Yes I know. Mm. Yeah. This wine is a shot in the dark. It was very much recommended by the Wine Society an Italian wine and I hope that I hope it's not full of this thing they're sending it all back for! Ooh I hope not no! We won't try it ! Well that's lovely! Considering its name,was as cheap white. There are limits to what I'd dare and This isn't a cheap wine! No, well I can just imagine he's probably hanging down ! It was a cheap wine that I thought Was it in ? that Yes. er . He'll come to that club. One of his fathers, yes. Girls, can I please persuade you not to touch the dish, whatever else if you need slide it then use , you see that Mhm, yeah. sort of thing or Right! Doing it tidily is always the thing isn't it? Yeah. Well that's the thing I have I had to give up years ago. Mm. What, trying to do everything tidily? Tidily! Cos I can't quite no, that's nice. I know, that's the problem. Mollie erm please don't touch that dish will you that's, er chipped potatoes in there and oh let me see what that is, can't you? That's gravy carrots and peas. You've had a problem with damp Mollie Noel tells me? Well it isn't erm specifically in the erm cupboards it's just erm because I'm now coping with who has acted like a erm shoemaker shoemaker's son do all your job I am coping with what he did thirty odd years ago Oh! and it's all gone bad! I mean the erm I still had to have completely new guttering in the summer because you cannot get anything to mend the other walls because it's the wrong side! And the only bit of damp I've got is in one corner of the house but it came from a blocked erm pipe. Oh I see! A blocked pipe. Oh that's awful! No, no not a blocked one but I mean let's face it It's alright now, carry on being all er carry on now and Mm. Tha , you know we can have a run of erm Yes. gutters they they they're in four piece, they're four yards or something. Yes. And then you have a join Yes. Yes. Well on that join I suddenly saw water rushing down the wall! You see that's a that's a comparable thing to what happened in ours and that was Erm, I'll do I'll do that cos, go on. Erm, assistant at any rate made water tip straight o out of the and down the wall you could never Into the , into the cabinet and the old wooden structure! Well yes. Mm. It was! I had to clear it all off though the the original, what they sort of call, what the dog there Oh really,! Well they had to come out to I think that maybe you should have done much more actually, but I I haven't argued because he's so . It's no good him taking the bridge down out now, because he can't put the wall can't really re-brick there now much too wet! That's right. Oh yes! Can you manage love? Yes, thank you dear. So that I'm suffering. The major thing I find so But I , my personal suffering was erm in the summer, frightfully! And you see, you know the ball over the gutters Yes. well said it doesn't look as if it's been painted once since it was built! Oh! And that's all Yep. wrong! Is no one any Yeah. of this of these Roast potatoes just there. potatoes. Oh Anne, come on! No, I'm not a potato person! You slimming? No, I just don't like potatoes. Well I like potatoes. I always had hopes of you! Have some more Mollie. Huge hunks of bread, I had a huge hunk of bread at tea time. Go ahead. Ah, you should never eat up to supper. That's right.

Very well thank you. congress Right now. Cheers! Cheers! Mm! Thank you so much for . That now. There's a very slight prickle with it isn't there Noel? It's not supposed to be a fizzy is it? They often do that don't they, you get a little funny prickle. What, with the wine? Yes. Mm. I know, I I was given That's right! because it was well written up in the Wine Society I would descr describe it as nice, nice but innocuous. Yes it's alright, it's nice but what darling? Nice but innocuous, I mean that's Oh I see. Mm, you can. Surely that's not as nice as well innocuous! And not nasty and innocuous. It has got a very slight fizziness though hasn't it? Mm. Yes. Very , very slight Yes. . Which often It has. goes out of it when it's . Well that's Well I mean Spumante and all, the lot of those Mm. Italian wines they're Now it's reminiscent a that that can't be my deja vu who, cos I don't think you can in tastes but it's reminiscent of something to me. Oh is it really? But I don't know what. Ha. What? Well maybe white wines are er spritzy aren't they? Oh yes, and this isn't I think. not meant to be . It often gets a little a little secondary fermentation in the bottles. Yes,i i it looks That's right. Mm. Oh does it? Yeah. Oh well. And it sort of fades. Mm. You can if it's But that red one but it's very strange sort of I know that with the Oh is that red? they'd already been I agree. Ya. That is very strange! It sort of erm in Italian wine once or twice but when I ordered this I took the care to order up Mm. in the price range somewhat. Mm. Yes it's true. Actually you're not fond enough of white wine are you to No. No, I'm not either I think No, no I'm not all that. red of the two. I mean I I You mean to say you ladies would have accepted red? No. Oh nice! Go and get a bottle of red. I'll go and get a bottle of red, quick. Oh that's, no No. oh no oh,ha oh No, and it doesn't really go with fish does it? Not really. Mm mm. Not really. David and I have searched high and low for it I don't see why not. but no but it doesn't quite I don't see why not. it doesn't erm not with fish in cream. Oh does it improve the the wine at all No. . Yeah. I think fish in cream sauce is a very nice is one that doesn't need a What kind of fish is this? It's very good. It's halibut. Oh Mm. by jes Yes, it's very nice! I'm glad I asked but I'm glad I asked cos I couldn't quite work out No? what it was. Well if I tell you a little secret about this. Mm. It's up at the fish shop in Framlingham Mhm. Mhm. and it now cheaper than coley! But sometimes So happen don't they? Coley is two ninety five a pound. mm mm. And halibut fillet is two sixty. Really? Really? Well cod, cod was stuff we used to moan when we children. Yes. Incredible! And it was the cheaper fish than, cheapest Yes. fish. Well yes, mm. I mean it was a common fish wasn't it? Mm. Mm. Really delicious! They're trying to put us off in because of the Mm. over fishing there's been. Mm. Mm. One you don't see much though is hake is it? No you don't and when we were children well we That's much nicer than cod. My mother used to do a Much nicer. A great big piece of hake Mm. and with as if it was chicken with erm parsley thyme stuffing Oh yes. a little bit of bacon Mm mm! Lovely! and it was baked and that was lovely! That would be it. Yes. Mm Mm! Mm. Oh yes, I remember grandfather who was very knowledgeable about fish we used to say that hake was the scavenger of the seas! Mm. Is that hake? a lot of people say they don't fancy hake . Mm. Well nobody used shrimps before. But the mackerel If it had been a mackerel, yes exactly! Oh yes. The mackerel Yes. is the one that mainly . I love mackerel! Those that eat, don't say it. I des describe it as a dirty eater, mackerel. Yes. Mhm. Yes. Mm. Well fruit sundae was rather Well shrimps and prawns shrimps and prawns are aren't they? Mm? Mhm. And full of phosphorous. Mm. Oh really? Yes. Good for our brains. Are, are they? Brains. Oh yes they are. Are they? They're Mm. the ones that shine in the dark when you're Mm mm. coming home rather failing That's right. and you that's right, you've got to run and ask them. And I've seen you do it in a lot of them. I don't know whether it was Oh yes! Oh really? Oh right, yes Haddock was very . Really? Haddock's got phosphorous in it? Yeah. Really? Mm mm. Good heavens! Look what I've done! Oh bother! Oh look what I've done. I've never known it as that. No, wasn't it a marvellous day today! Weather was Absolutely incredible! You know tha that his lordship er cut the grou , the field. Really? Yes! the field. I wish would cut mine! Ne ne near the Mm. in the holiday, aren't there holidays? Why not, I've seen the I thought it was a bit early yet, there's a frost isn't it now? There's morning , I'm No I mean that erm if you cut the grass just before frost it doesn't like it does it? Oh but then, this is only But when, that's right. You shouldn't cut that though, but er I think a lawn, not, no. No but she was sayi That's right. Now really but erm this year's been so peculiar that Mm. people are going to want to cut it. Mm. Their only choice. Well I mean the normally it would kill the grass, but it won't matter this year. Mm. I wonder if we'll get any snow? No, no, no. No. John the butcher at erm butcher this morning and I said never say it's gonna snow, I said, it won't snow will it John? He said well you've been right since Christmas and if you say it's not going to snow, it's not going to snow! Mm. Mm mm. Mm. This What about the birds? And I walked up the village this morning the birds were singing their songs Mm. that they sing and the reels were I just think we've marvellous! we've had lots of rain! Well the flood barrier! I know! Well we A an shan't, we shan't and have a flood. Anne is terribly on my side, she, still hasn't rained every time I see her! Oh! I think, she said if you dig down a way it's dry Mm. from nineteen eighty Mm. nine still! Mm. I wonder whether that's what er, I wonder i you see it looks damp on the top doesn't it? Mm, very slightly, really But but if you dig down about six inches, it's dry! Mm. So they they gone and what they call the head at least four times lately. Mm. Just walking in the garden I was Very slightly isn't it? Very slightly. Mm. Mm. though. Mm. Terribly frightening! Mm, mm. It just would be so awful to move our lovely trees cos they're all so, so dependent, that's it! That's the the trees. That's all I worry about. Yes! It's no good worrying about it, I do know that! Mhm. It is But worrying though. Well no, I've met pe also Lady Mm mm. and she said David said he saw a few snow flakes. Well I said if I see three snow flakes we're off to Tenerife! Well we have, we have. Mm. Very slight snow shower about two days ago didn't we? Yes. It was powdery. Yes, like, mm Very, a little powdery and And it didn't stay. We were on the way back from visiting Mm. er Richard, you know, and i Mm. and I said, that's snow! Mm. Oh really? Just powdery. So we half an hour of sleet once. Mhm. That was . And it bounced and bounced and bounced and I thought it was going on for ages but it didn't. No. Oh! Soon disappeared. Mm. Have you got any fish left in your pond Mollie? No. Haven't you? Heron took the lot! Oh no! Oh God! Oh! and we were having lunch, a late lunch on what day did I say? On Sunday cos they were going soon and erm James was clearing up the garden you see I've go , I can't I I can see gable Yes. and the gables over on erm the lodge and I can't see Past. Yes, Are they a bit nearer? I mean i it all looks the same Yeah. to me. Mm. And the heron you see is the same colour to me as the grass. Oh yes! And James said, there's a heron slaughtering one of your big goldfish! Aagh! You see. Yeah. Oh and we all rushed out and said, shoo! And it flew o , flew away. Mm. And then Ted and I went out a little bit later and we sa , we found two goldfish and two golden They damage them don't they? Oh,! so they haven't got a or they No, they bite so, oh do they? No they , they swallow them. Yeah. I mean they swallow them quite nicely. And sometimes they just And I said well that's ! next time. And the next day I went off and there wasn't even a snail No. in the pond. No. Nothing at all! No. Oh God! Cos I think I've That's terrible! got a carp too. Oh yeah! Terrible! If perhaps you were to spread erm a wire netting over the pond Mollie? Well yes I know, but I'm not having that! But erm what I am going to do but I can't do it until the spring erm at least until erm has cut the grass for the first time Mm. erm, out there. Then I'm going to do what is the proper thing to do which is chop that to size With the same as that , yes! Yes, Oh yes that that and farm and Yes. this black so many creatures black stuff Yep! so they could be thrown over Oh this behaviour, no, they're so inflexible with their programme! Three feet from the wall from your you see, and they get their I see! feet tangled Yeah. but I can't, it's no good doing it now because you see erm dogs can get in at present and Yes. and rushing about and You needn't do anything horrid to them, terrible! I mean,you can just er Oh no! a wire cage they, no just go away. I mean I've seen it them. they don't like it. No. They're incapable No. That's right. because of the erm it's not wire, it's No. just a a thread, you Oh! see? And they get a bit Mm. Mm mm. My father always used to do that for his crocuses because the birds loved the yellow ones, don't they? Mm. Mm. And his daffs, he was going to use his, lose his yellow crocuses of the year so he spread black cotton Oh yes mm. Mm. and they jolly well learned Yes, I know, simple. that that's what Oh yeah. that it Mollie. was there! Mm. So we had to get used to the ending up in Mm. black cotton against the sparrows I used to get really fed up with it! Poor little things! And I thought I'd got I understand now what it was. knowing erm why all the purple cro crocuses good cook and I thought I've got no And at nights I used to feel like and I had got cos they've come now haven't they? Ah yes, that's And I right I told you! All I've got all morning, Mm. and I've got clumps of of snowdrops where I'd and some where I didn't know even know I had snowdrops and Mm. now I have found those lovely little erm wild purple crocuses Mm. I couldn't Good! think what their was? Right in the middle of a plot needless Mhm. and they're all coming out! And they're round Good! my ! Good! And so I, I've found that there but I've, but I've lost my baytree. Mm. How much But that's moles. Mm. Oh moles! Oh dear! Well they got down in the grass you see. There's quite a lot of them again this Mm. year. They got them, mm? They have a lot again this year, moles. Will we? Mm. Well I've got millions! Well I Have we? I must ring erm r Eddy and ask him if you get them ? I don't know whether you can get them wi weather like this. Oh! Why do you say there peak bone density is probably attained and after that you, you do go downhill, to maximise the calcium intake. Nowadays people are worried about er, drinking milk and dairy products because of the cholesterol bit, but I think that we've got to remember that there's a lot of calcium in milk and you should drink milk and take plenty of exercise and that is the time when it's probably extremely important! Yes? Wha , what do you do if you're allergic milk? Cos I haven't drink milk from, since a baby and Well tha , that's a bit more difficult. There are other foods that you can get it from, such as ice Erm cream, sardines Yoghurt? yoghurt. No,co oh well you'll be allergic to that too. I'm allergic, I'm allergic to a lot of foods! Can I, I want to pick up er, something that that Margaret said which is, I've got lots of time to worry about it. Now, obviously, you know,yo getting the menopause out into the open so that everyone can talk about it, exchange information that that it's not seen as a as a taboo or something to be particularly fearful of by men or women isn't going to be much good if it just makes everybody worry for er, for for the first half of o o o of their lives and, and then gibber through the second half! I mean, there is an argument,ha and it's been put by er a a noted writed who's recently written on the menopause that,work, and you should just make the most of being a crone or a hag or an old women! No! Now , I'm not saying I se , but it's a view that has been put forward,wha wha what do you think of that? Yes? I wouldn't actually say that you know, one has got to suffer unduly, but I think we do have to be very, very careful that we don't just play into the hands of the drug manufacturers! See, they've got most women hooked on, on er contraceptive pill for all their reproductive life and they're dead keen that we should all get so worried about menopause that we would also be buying their products until we die! Now, although I have great respect for er, the representative of the Osteoporosis Society I se , I still think as a epidemiologist that there haven't been enough women on H R T for long enough Mhm. for us to prove one way or the other that that, that that they co , the advantages out weigh the disadvantages. So you think we have some guinea pigs here? You have to be cautious! How long do you want them to be on H R T for? We've been following a group through in Glasgow who've been H, on H R T now for twenty three years! Up there. I think if you went and saw our own doctors a lot of our fears would be allayed because most of the young doctors wouldn't, would recommend to you, my own doctor asked me all the questions and different things and then he says he's a young doctor, he says if I were a women and if I'd answered all the questions as you did, I would go on H R T. So, there might be a lot of doctors who would do. Right. Beside you? Yes. Yes? I think you really highlights on working alongside with your doctor. I think you'll be able to read up as much information as possible and see a doctor and consult and especially th where women's clinic are, a great boom! And we should attend Mm. it more often. Up there. I would just like to say that erm, it's not all gloom and doom! Mm. The menopause isn't necessarily the end of our life, it can be the beginning of so many new different things. Yes? I I think erm, that it can be looked at to, without H R T or looking at it medically, because lots of the women at Dean Terrace, in fact have That's a family planning er problem That's right! situation. Yep! but erm, have erm problems with what this lady has described who can't come to terms with Mhm. the er loss of their fertility and the loss of their children and, have sexual problems and problems like that, and they don't necessarily need H R T they need lots of time, which they're given. And I think that helps them an awful lot! Is it impossible that your sex life might improve after the menopause? I mean I I wo er would anything like to say anything about Do we have to? No! a friend's experience or anything like that? Nelly? Yes I would like to say, it was smashing after the because you didn't have to worry that you were gonna have another child! So, though I had a bad time, well I had a, I've had a great life since! Good! Up there? What do you do about er, a doctor who says no? I mean, do you change your doctor or what? Yes. Who would like to answer that one? Yes? Get more information first, so that you know all your facts and if you ask us we'll send him a booklet without saying who er, who asked us to send it and then go in and see him and say, now the Osteoporosis Society have said this and it's a very brave doctor who will then say absolutely no! I'm, I'm not listening to you! But, in the final analysis, if you can't get any help, if he won't refer you to a specialist for help change your doctor! Because if the garage did your car badly you wouldn't have any hesitation in in changing your garage and your body's a darn sight more important than your car! I think women can sail into a beautiful old age with enthusiasm for hobbies, taking up new interests of all sorts and I've taken up skiing after the age of fifty and I'm, I feel I'm getting on well with it and this fresh air and and you know, getting out and finding who you really are after, you know, looking after children is is a wonderful thing! And this will keep you young! I don't have H R T, I didn't have any problems luckily, with the menopause but I feel I've I've found a bit more of who I really am, you know! I'm very interested in that because that is what Germaine Greer says in her book, it's only after the menopause that you have the freedom and the liberty, to find out Yes! Yes it who you really are! Does Exactly! does does does anybody, yes! Yes. Well I had a hysterectomy when I was forty nine and to me life really did begin at fifty! I go dancing! I'm now sixty two and I go dancing twice a week! So, I mean apart from arthritis life's quite good! Here. Can I say, I'm thirty six and had a hysterectomy a year ago. Mhm. I'm taking flushes and whatever but I feel brand new compared to what I felt before I had a hysterectomy cos I was totally lifeless! And I can agree with the ladies that say life begins once you get by all these problems that you had before. Up there. As a younger person I, I would expect that I've probably got another fifteen years to go to the menopause, but I'm looking forward to it as a relief from pre-menstrual syndrome! And, I wondering if any of the experts can say if there's erm a link between the severity of menopausal symptoms and pre-menstrual symptoms? Okay a final, final expert view on that. Who would like to offer a fortunately no. Yo erm your er it isn't your fate in life to have all this pro , though major problems erm, and I think P M S is a major problem. And, in fact er I would hopeful that you will be feel better. Yes. Mm. I have a question to the politicians. The N H S cannot cope in the moment with you know, regular sort of cervical cancer smears. Mhm. How can they cope in the future with sort of er monitoring the effects of H R T? Well er, that's for politicians watching, think about it to care about! Yes? Well if er, more women do take hormone replacement therapy and we cut the osteoporosis we will in fact have far money in the health service besi , because it costs a hundred and eighty million pounds a year to treat hip fractures alone at the moment! Germaine Greer has coined a term which you may have read, which is er which is called PM zed! Or PM zee, I suppose in America which she terms post-menopausal zest! Is post menopausal zest something that er every woman could look forward to if she gets the right advice, the right Definitely! treatment? Yes,! I think this being an old hag is what is all in the mind! If you're determined to enjoy the rest of your life you will! Be positive! Be positive about it, yes! I don't agree with that Sheena! No! You only have to listen to what women here have told you and it's not psychological! It's a myth! It is physiological! And there are plenty of people who have spoken here tonight have substantiated that! Mhm. , my first years had two children, had no breast problems and I'm having a horrendous time just now and I'm on H R T, I'm on my third different kind! And I've had so , examinations and my doctor is very good! Do , the doctor I have now is very good and very sympathetic! But she feels there's nothing you actually can do to help me with! Final word? As I've said, I've been on H R T for three years and, I have since went back to work after being on H R T I don't think I'm an old hag! I don't want to be like a film star, but I do want a better quality of life and I've got that with H R T! We're going to have to end and I'm sorry about that because er, it's been very interesting! You've heard a very broad range of views, erm, of all sorts! I think the most important thing that we've done is talk about it. Ninety one people here wanted more information. There is information available. I hope you can find it, er if yo if er if you want and and the important thing is to keep talking about it, keep exchanging information. Thanks everybody here for your experiences and information! Goodbye! Somebody once said that if angelism, sharing the gospel was one beggar telling another beggar about bread, where it could be found and undoubtedly when he was saying that he was thinking of that story that account that we had read to us earlier from the second book of kings, chapter seven, and I'd like us to er turn back to us for a few moments this morning and perhaps draw some lessons for ourselves Sometimes as Christians its very easier for us to say what sins are, and we can see other people's failings, you don't have to be a Christian to do that of course, plenty of other people can do that, they see the failings of other people, they see the wrong doing they do, they see their wickedness their, their waywardness, whatever words we want to use to describe it, and we say well that is sin, perhaps for most of us this morning we could make er a list a, a, a tabulate a table of sins and we might say well they are worse sins and there are lesser sins and I would I suppose by and large there would be a fairly reasonable consensus of opinion regarding what was sins and what were not sins. Sometimes the bible surprises us a little bit of course, and it puts it finger on things that we perhaps don't really want to talk about or we don't even consider as sins and the bible is quite clear that not all sins are what we do often there what we don't do in parable that Jesus told concerning the traveller, the man who went down to Jericho, we don't condemn the priest and the levite for what they did, but we do condemn them for what they didn't do, their sin was not what they did, it was what they left undone, going over and looking at the man was very note worthy, as least there was some interest there and we don't condemn them for that, but we do condemn them for hurrying along and not reaching out and helping the man in the Pistol of James and chapter four and verse seventeen James says there, any one then who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it, sins so the sins that you and I comment or the sins rather that we are guilty of are not just the things that we do there of times the things that we don't do and sometimes there more difficult for us to put a finger on, we can justify them so very easily its been said that all it needs for evil to triumph, is for good men to say or to do nothing well lets look at the, that,illu illustration there that we have in the second book of kings. As I mentioned early the, the city of Sermaria it was under siege and the army of Seria was encamped all around it, Ben Hadad was a great warrior, he would of been the, the Alexander or the Napoleon of his day and he had set up this encampment around the city of Sermaria, nobody could get in, nobody could get out and very quickly the stocks of food and water er were used up, rationing would of been introduced but it only lasted for a certain period, they'd got to the stage it tells us in the previous chapter that er, that a donkeys head was sold for eighty shekel's of silver and some folk had even got to the, had sunk to the level of cannibalism, of eating their own children and the city was, when they heard about this they were in an uproar and they started blaming god and in between the city of Sermaria of all its suffering and hopelessness and helplessness and the army encamped about with all of their supplies, there was this area of no mans land in which they were caught up four men who were leapers and they were trapped there, they didn't want to go over to the Serians because they'd be killed, they didn't want to go back into the city because they weren't allowed there and any way what was the point, they'd only die of starvation in there and so these four men are caught up in no man's land and yet their no better off than people in the city, now god had promised deliverance, through his serve and Eliger he had promised deliverance, Eliger said tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour shall be sold for a se shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Semaria, he said the gates are gonna be open, there's gonna be food and its gonna be a reasonable price and it says the royal officer who's hand the king was leaning on said the man of god said behold, if the lord shall make windows in heaven could such a thing be, he said don't talk stupid man, how can such a thing happen for us?, he didn't believe what god servant said and Eliger brings out to him a terrible judgment, he says because of your unbelief you will see it, but your not participate in it but lets look at these four men for a moment, cos that's where our real interest lies this morning, I just wanted to say three things in their experience, the first things is that they were amazed that, at what they found, because after they come together and they talk about it and they said well what shall we do and they weighed the pro's and the cons and Semaria doesn't look very attractive with its cannibalism, they said well the least if we stay here were gonna die, if we go into Semaria we'll die, lets go down to the Serein camp, the worse they can do to us is put us to death and were dying men any way, but they may just take pity on us, we maybe allowed to grope around in their dustbins and get some scraps of food, they may at least allow us that, and so they make their way down just as evening is falling, they make their way down to the Serein lines and when they get there, they are amazed at what they find, you see their condition was helpless and hopeless, they were dying men any way, they were lepers, but they were dying of starvation, that was far more imminent than their leprosy, their problems and their needs were greater than themselves, they could not meet their own needs, their problems and their needs were greater than their government, the king in Semaria and all of his court could not meet the needs of his people and then in verse five, we read something there, they arose at twilight to go to the camp of Aramians or the Serein's and when they came to the outskirts of the camp of the Serein's behold there was no one there, they expected to at least meet a guard, there would surely be somebody on sentry duty even if the rest of the soldiers had gone in to their tents and were perhaps getting ready for their, for the evening, going to bed or whatever they were gonna be doing, having their evening meal, there would at least be somebody on guard duty, but when they got there, there was no one there, god had stepped in, god had intervened and the good news of the Christian gospel is that god has intervened in our, in the midst of our helplessness, in the midst of our hopelessness, god has intervened, he had stepped in to history, so often you'll hear folks say, well why doesn't god do something, why does god allow this to happen, why does god allow that one, why doesn't he do something all they really show by that comment is their own ignorance, because god has done something, god has intervened, listen to what it says in John three sixteen, for god so loved the world that he gave, he's only son and the er, the er apostle Paul and he's writing to the Gallations, in chapter four and in verses four and five hear what he says there,but when the time had fully come god sent his son, born of a woman, born under law to redeem those under law that we might receive the full rights of son, er of sons , god has done something, he's sent his son Jesus Christ into this world in fact his done the greatest thing he could do, he has done the very ultimate thing, he has sent his son into the world that's the greatest intervention god could ever have made, it was far greater than, than just intervening in sm , in some small local event, were you see some catastrophe happening and you say well why doesn't god do something there, or there's a war situation going on in some other part of the world, well why doesn't god step in and stop it, god has stepped in, not in a local situation, not in some er passing problem or need but he's stepped into the greatest way possible by sending his son Jesus Christ into the world to dye for men and woman, to take away sin, to pay the price that god's righteousness demands for sin so god has intervened and his intervention has changed the whole situation, its brought a whole new complexion on things, its changed the colour completely, no longer is the world now under darkness and in, and in pending judgment in doom, because Jesus Christ came and he took that judgment and that, that condemnation upon himself, he said I've not come to condemn the world he said its already condemned, its already under judgement, the sword of Damocles is already hanging over the world and Jesus Christ came in and to take that judgment and that condemnation on himself and when he died there on the cross and rose again, there came that burst of light in a world that had been shrouded in blackness and darkness, a world that had been shrouded in sin suddenly for the first time sees the light, god has paid for himself the price of sin, god has intervened and changed the whole situation and the message of the gospel is that if you and I allow that intervention to effect us personally, then like those four men surely we too are amazed at what we've found. If we've come to guard and received forgiveness of sins, if we have become good followers of Jesus Christ and we are not amazed then there's something wrong with what we've received that god should so love, not just the world, but should so love me, that he gave his son to die for me and that was the sort of er discovery that these four lepers made they've come down there, they've found that the sight before them was amazing, there was no enemy there, the enemy had disappeared and the tents with all their contents were there before them, they were amazed with what they found and you and I when we come to god through Jesus Christ, we are amazed at what we find, we find forgiveness, we find the restoration of a relationship between ourselves and god, we find an access to receive god's blessing to receive his favour, to receive his gifts that he has for us, no wonder the apostle Paul cries out thanks beyond to god for his unspeakable gift, but then again these four men they were not just amazed that what they found, they were, they got absorbed in what they got, because they got a lot more than they bargained for, they possibly in their wildest dreams thought they might at least get, get what the cook was throwing out, they might get to, to the dustbins, they might get what was left over, that would of been great, they were dying of starvation, the driest mouldiest crust would of been like, like a banquet to them, but they got so much more than they anticipated and they got absorbed in it, every thing was there's for the taking as they pulled back the, the flap of the tent as they go in and they see the tables laid out there, they see the food and the drink, they see the plenty, these men who for weeks have known terrible poverty, there might of been a time earlier on in the siege when a few scraps got thrown over the city wall, when the bins were put out the side of the city of an evening, er they would go there and forage amongst them, but all that had stopped long since and it was only the bits and pieces that they managed to forage for themselves and get for themselves that they'd been eating of late, but here every thing is there for the taking, they rubbed their eyes, they pinched one another to make sure their not dreaming, it really is food and drink in a, in an abundance they couldn't of thought of a few mo hours earlier one moment they had nothing, the next they've got every thing, what was it they needed, food, the tables would of been laden with it, it was the food, enough food for an army and there's only four of them, did they, were they thirsty, here was drink, here was wine and, and drink in abundance the rags, the tatters they were dressed in, there were garments and wardrobe full of clothes here for them, did they need money, well the tents were full of the gold and the silver and, and, and valuables, there were a sufficiency, every thing was there you know the idea that the Christian life is drab and poor is such a terrible false hood, its an iniquitous lie of the devil, the tragedy is that we have actually often made it that way, we have made the Christian faith something drab, something boring, something for old folk er and er you know, people who are, who are, just wanting a crutch because their coming to the end of their natural life and we've made it something drab and dull listen to what the apostle Paul says when he's writing to Carinthian's in his second letter in chapter eight, he says you know the grace of our lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might be rich, god, he's purpose follows his people, he's not that we've a drab, grey, dull uninteresting life, Jesus said I've come that you might of life, and that more abundant, that in all its fullness and god has purpose for us, and when Paul is talking about riches there, he's not talking about pounds and pence, he's talking about the richness of the life that we enjoy its not a case of not doing this and having to do that the other thing, its a case of enjoying life as god purposes it, as god intends it you know if you don't enjoy your Christian life now, let me tell you your in for a rude awakening when you get to heaven, because the quality of life is not gonna change the only things that'll change is its la it, it will, it will be in his presence, the quality of life will not change because already now we have received eternal life, he has given his life to us and he hasn't got some other special, you know, super duper life laid up, there's nothing, there's nothing greater ahead, god hasn't got any thing greater for us than what he's already given to us in embryonic form here and now why if we take on er a, a, a dazzling scintillating new zest and zap when you get to heaven, that life is already given to you and to me know go back to these four men at the moment, they had never known any thing like this before this was better than all their birthdays rolled into one, this was the greatest day in their experience and if they would live to be a hundred they would never know another day like this, they were having a tremendous time, it said they, they, they, they went into one tent, listen to what they did, they went into one tent and they, they ate, they drank, they had a party and they carried from there the silver, the gold and the clothes and they went and hid they returned and entered another tent and then they did the same there, they were having a tremendous time, this was a beano to end all beano's, this was the greatest day in their life, they were having a wonderful time and why shouldn't they, why not you know there are folk who would, who'd want to make us as Christians er and er, ee, put us into a straight jacket the bible tells me even the sunsets free, is free indeed and I don't see any suggestions as I read the New Testament, that first of all the life of Jesus was drab and uninteresting, or that he expects me as his follow to lead a drab, a grey life, oh its not always gonna be a ple an easy life but that doesn't reduce the, the zest and the excitement in it but you see the danger is when having a good time is the reason for living and the only reason for it, you see, if god has intervened in our life, if the message of the gospel is true, if god in Christ has taken away your sin and made you in Christ a new creation then you have every reason to enjoy life, in a sense your only able to start enjoying life now, you may have enjoyed some of the things that, that folks suggest that make up life, but they've finished, there gone, what happens when the, when, when the wine has run out, what happens when the parties over, you know all about it the next day, don't you, what happens then, its such short lived, its only worth having whilst its coming to you all the time, but that's not so with a Christian life, because it doe , depend on just the things that we have or the experiences that we go through, because it is something that, that we have within, it is, it is a quality of life that we possess, because we possess the one who is life himself, listen to what Paul says when he's writing to Timothy in his first letter in chapter six it is command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant or to put their hope in wealth, those who think that, that er in having possessions that is the secret of life or, or in having a good time and, and, and the rest of it that is what life is all about, he said warn them not to do that, because that is so uncertain, he says but to put their hope in god who richly provides us with every thing what for, for our enjoyment, why has god given us these things, why is, why is god even, he is natural creation there for us, it is for our enjoyment, its not to make us miserable or to make us grey and drab and burden by it, it is for us to enjoy, when god created Ada Adam and Eve and put them in the garden, the, they were told to enjoy it, even the fruit enjoy it, its there for your benefit and then the new creation, every thing that god has provided is there for our enjoyment, but the dangers is when that enjoyment, is the reason for living and that's all we do it for and were so taking up with ourselves, I am gonna have my good time, I'm gonna enjoy myself as a Christian and I can do it and you can do it, you become insular and we become introverted and the only thing that matters is me having a good time, my world centres around me and me enjoying myself and me having this and me having that, this blessing and that gift and that other blessing, we become self centred and taken up with our own good times, as long as I can be there in the centre, as long as I can go from, from, from this celebration to that celebration, as long as I can go from this er festival to that festival to this special meeting to that one, I'm gonna have my good time well that was what these fella's were doing, they were going from tent to tent, from celebration to celebration having a great time and then the truth hit them they were ashamed with what they had done, they said to one another we are not doing right, this days a day of good news, but we are keeping silent, if we wait until morning light punishment will overtake us, now therefore, come, let us go and tell the kings household how guilty are we, how guilty are you, how guilty am I of the sinner silence, remember how we started, its not always the things that we do its often the things that we don't do, how guilty are we of the sin of silence these men had known nothing, known poverty and, and, and, and starvation, they were amazed at what they'd found, they'd became absorbed in what they had got and now they'd became ashamed of what they had done with it what was the sin that troubled these men they said we are keeping silent. Back in the city there were thousand of people doomed, dying and all unnecessarily because here was plenty, here was sufficient for the whole city and possibly the greatest sin that you and I can be guilty of and that the church is generally guilty of, but you know when we talk about the church generally its, its so easy because that's general, you and I that are the church, not the denomination, not the organization, it you and I, possibly the greatest sin that we can be guilty of is the sin of silence, I'm not talking now about a rude, belligerent, discourteous, butting hole, button holding of people, I'm not talking about that, I don't see any place in gods word for that sort of attitude or that sort of approach but are we still silent, what about with those with whom we have the right, because we've created a relationship, because they know us and they've seen us and they've seen the experiences we've gone through and they've seen what god has done in our lives, what about with those people do we wait for others to do it, shifting the responsibility. thinking in, in, in the context of our, of our mission, this town wide mission, well that's Billy's job, he's better at it than I am, but its not his job, its my job as much as its his and its your job as much as its mine, we do not well to keep silent these men they were troubled by their sin of silence, perhaps you and I should be troubled by our sin of silence because the extension of that, and here's the really great thing, as far as they were concerned, the ex the, the ongoing because they were troubled by their sin of silence and they did something about it, they were thrilled at the sight that they saw, as they see the city being delivered, and as they see starving men and women eating food perhaps for the first time in days or weeks, buying good wholesome food at a reasonable price, that was the sigh that thrilled them and you can imagine them, and I think they'd be entitled to a little bit of pride that I'm glad we told them, I'm glad we went back and shared the news apart from any thing we couldn't of coped with all ourselves, it would of been so wrong to of kept it, it would of been so wrong just to of eaten it ourselves, I'm glad we went back and told them. Jesus said just before he was living his disciples, his followers, you and me, he said you shall receive power after the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me yes we witness by our life but there's a danger in making that a cop out, because one other requirement of a witness is that they talk, they've gotta say what they know, these four men were good witnesses, they went back and they told the city what they had found, and there's placed upon you and me that responsibility to go back and to tell what we've found, this is a day of good tidings, we do wrong to keep silent. what she's going to do. Right. Erm I'm here as a representative of a small company from York, called and what we're doing is we're working on behalf of the Group, who compile and publish the English Dictionary. And what I'm doing here today is, I'm recording this seminar as an instance of spoken English in the nineteen nineties. Which will go towards making a corpus of information from which will draw the meaning and usage of words as it was in the nineteen nineties. And this information will be linguistically analyzed, and then used to help compile the new dictionary which will be coming out in a few years. So I thank you all very much for taking part in this, and I hope you have a happy seminar. The people at the back may not be picked up on this so erm He should be here any minute. Right. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Morning. Sorry for coming in under the wire at er nine fourteen according to this clock. Erm Hugh's asked me to open this morning's erm quality seminar. Erm a a you're in for quite a good day. I know that er the seminar which I attended sparked off quite a lot of lively er debate. And er at the end of it I think we all felt we knew where we were going, and, and what the work that we'd put in over the last three years on the management procedures, which form the foundations of our quality system. Er I think we came to realize what that work was all in aid of. The management team had, I'll sit down if you don't mind, the management team has decided that we were going to go for quality because it was a matter of survival. The industry which we are part of is in excuse me, is in er sorry about this I've dashed across here I I'll read from Hugh's notes if you don't mind. Erm I would like to remind you of my objectives quoted at the time in th in the quality manual. Er to adopt best practices, er from the various offices, to help produce a better end product. To delegate decision making down as far as possible. And as far as our group's vision statement is concerned, to be acknowledged as the leading consultant in the rail er in the field of railway engineering. To provide a professional service satisfact I'm sorry Dennis, would you just excuse me? Can I hand over to you? I I I do apologize. Right. Sorry about that. Sorry I'm totally unprepared for this. Erm To start at the top and unfortunately I'll reread Hughie's notes. Perhaps wavering slightly. Erm It's now thr nearly three years since management procedures were introduced as the first stage of our aspirations to become quality assured. And I would like to you, remind you of my objectives quoted at that time and as are stated in the er manual. That is firstly to adopt best practice from various offices, which hopefully would help us to provide a better end product. And to delegate decision making er to as low a level as possible within the organization, compatible with safeguarding er the quality of the product that we provide to our clients. The group as you are aware do have a vision statement, erm which has been published er and it was er developed a couple of years ago er great effort by the er management team. And that vision statement is, to be acknowledged as the leading consultant in the railway i in the fields of railway engineering. To provide a professional service satisfying our clients' needs and exceeding their expectations. To be a well trained, dedicated and highly motivated team and to be committed totally to safety. Now that vision has not changed. That is still the group's er vision and stated objectives. Erm as far as certification of er th the of a system is concerned er we are still comm committed to getting office certificated and as many of you may be aware the Swindon office has actually overtaken us on the B E S side erm and they are er, but hopefully we will achieve certification for the whole of our group erm prior to Swindon achieving certification for their whole group. The subtle difference is tha that Swindon are going function by function and getting er five certificates. Er ours is a slightly more difficult task, I would suggest a much more difficult task, in that we're trying to go for one certificate for the whole of the group. Erm we believe, er if we are to demonstrate to our clients that we are as good or better than our competitives competitors, then we need certification. And this is seen as a matter of survival. Er fairly recently we were asked to tender for erm a new station at Rickmansworth for Crossrail and one of the prerequisites of that job, er which was a ten million pound project, er one of the prerequisites of that job, was that we should either be certificated or at least have a quality assurance erm system in place. And because er we do have a quality assurance system in place although not certificated, er we were able to tender for that work. Otherwise we would have not been able to tender. Erm I think I'll leave this up till . The basic message of quality, which Mike will er explain later on is, if you improve quality your costs decrease. Because you are continually reducing the number of mistakes that you make and continually improv improving. Erm and therefore you produce less wasted time, less remedial work er and a cheaper product. Erm quality could be regarded as an empty word. We need to bring it about, and it can only be done through teamwork. That's the point that Hughie has set as one of his objectives for the next twelve months, is to get the group acting as one team, and not five or six separate teams. Erm this is going to be extremely difficult because the British culture is one of every man for himself. People tend not to work particularly well in teams in this country. Erm but it's something that we need to work at. And th the Japs actually score in this because they actually believe totally in teamwork. Erm we need to change our culture. Erm I think really I'll just leave it there cos I'm a bit struggling, struggling a little bit to remember quite what Hughie was saying. If you appreciate I was actually thrown into the very deep end. I think perhaps what's going to be said to you to the rest of the day erm will actually bring out the key points tha that Hughie was trying, trying to make. One was that quality is here. Quality is here to stay. Quality is improvement. And the other aspect is one of working as a team. I think those were the two main messages that Hughie wished to get across today, and that we will concentrate on er during the rest of this seminar. Erm th that the seminar is going to be lead by Mike . Er Mike is from Associates and Mike has been helping the, the Q A team on a part time basis, and putting some sensible thought into how the group should go forward. Erm but before Mike comes on I would just like er Norman to make a few comments er on his commitment to the group's er quality system. Morning. Er quality. Definition of quality, right product at the right time, at the right price. Now in P Way Design we have no problems with that, do we? Or do we? Erm we are the most profitable part of the S A U. No problems about that. Er we've no great problems with our technical results, and where they are we sort them out quite amicably with the area people. We meet our main deadlines, which are normally the key deadline normally the S and C. We meet it don't we? So there's no problem. Or is there? Just looking at it in a bit more detail. We're profitable but we normally don't compete with anyone else for getting the work. So effectively we put in what is a fair price, and we get the job, and we do it normally within the price or within a slight overspend. But where we have competed, accidentally in one case, deliberately in another, we've been undercut by our rivals and we haven't got the job. Also a good pointer where we've been able to compare ourselves with civil engineering scaled fees, which was on the Overtown Bank Slip which was a job which went completely right, perfect no problems. If we'd have put in a price based on A C scaled fees, we would have overspent by a hundred and fifty five percent. So we thought. So perhaps there's a, a little bit of work we can do in er in that sphere. The right time. How many times have I had someone come and say, can you sign this drawing please it has to go, go to John tonight. He's taking it for the meeting tomorrow. Er how many times have we said, yeah, we can do this job but we'll, it needs the route improvement that we're doing for Arthur . Or er , Arthur's in no hurry. Well Arthur is a very reasonable and good friends with us. But he notices, it builds up, he starts thinking to himself, they're always late. It's no great problem but I'm not getting it on time. Yet he begins to notice if we do it . Think about our finished product. I said you know the minor er faults and discrepancies, we er tidy up quite amicably with the area people normally. But what we've got to bear in mind is that minor faults in our design can be very serious when translated to a job on the ground which . Also the person who has helped us sort out maybe come to sensible engineering conclusion on the minor problem, but be saying to his chief, there was a problem with the York though I just managed to sort it out. And that builds up. Also what you've got to bear in mind is that inherent in any permanent way job is the capacity for something to go wrong. And when something goes wrong there's recriminations and when there's recriminations, people will crawl for ways out. That is the time for there to be nothing wrong with our drawings. Drawings can be blamed when er there is actually nothing wrong and people are looking for an excuse blame from themselves. So again for reasons like that, we have to maintain the confidence of the client. And that today is what it's all about. If the client is confident that he's getting the best deal from us, he will say, alright Birmingham ar are cheaper than York on a route improvement say, but I've had one of their cheap jobs before. I'll, I'll stick with York and get value for money. Erm drawing the client, is he has confidence in us say, well York have got their act together. If the S if the S and if the S and T give them a, a fair crack of the whip. There's no problems with York, they always given me a good service in the past. And the er technical quality of our drawings the client if he has confidence will say, who are you trying to kid? York drawings are good. just just yarning You're trying to d divert attention erm erm disturb discrepancies. So it's a question of us retaining, because to a certain extent we already have it, due to our customer past. Retaining and renewing customer confidence. And this is where B S five seven fiv five O certification or I S O Nine Thousand and one certification is important to us. As Dennis has said from er Hughie's erm erm er statement, it is a requirement nowadays. And it's valuable to us in, in three aspects. First of all,certification is a bedrock of achievement, like having a degree, and you need a degree or an H N C or an O N C. It's a statement in itself. More importantly, it's er conveys to the client that we care about quality, that we've gone to the trouble to set up procedures which make our product as good as it possibly can be. And thirdly, it has a very real er value in that, in going for er certification, we are actually putting checks and procedures in place which will help to ensure that what we do is the right price, is to the right time and is the right product. So that's basically all er just one after thought, Dennis mentioned teamwork, now we we've been together for a few years basically, but you might say, we work as a team, everyone gets on, everyone helps each other out. We do within P Way Design, which is probably the best office I've ever worked in for that. But what we've got to bear in mind is that we are a multi-functional group. There's PICAS involved, works office involved, to a lesser extent B E S. So that is really where a weakness is, it's in perceiving the needs of other parts, parts of the group. That's something that we do have to work on and I can't emphasize it too strongly. Okay. Er I've said a lot so I'll er leave you to Mike to take things further. Thank you very very much Norman that's great. Have you all got a programme in the folder? So that you've got a vague idea of er what's going to befall you for the rest of today? Okay? We'd very much like you to feel free to ask any questions or comment er er on, on the er presentations during the course of the morning. Er and this afternoon. So don't hesitate to ask questions or, or discuss points which you feel erm have not be made very clearly or perhaps with which you don't even agree. And let's try and resolve any issues which, which come up like that. What we want to do this morning is erm tt talk a little bit to you about er the quality system and the I S O Nine Thousand procedures and er documented er systems, which have been developed so far within the whole group. Er and we want to try and explain a little bit about tt how far we got in terms of achieving certification to I S O Nine Thousand. But we then want to er explain w what this business of quality planning is all about. Because we believe very very strongly wi that with an organization like yours, where each piece of work that you do is slightly different from other pieces of work, to have er a single m way, an approach to following the work er is, is really not, not the right er thing to do at all. What we're looking for is a quality system and a set of procedures which are flexible enough to enable you to handle the slick jobs, which you haven't got a lot of fee income for. And we want you to able to handle the, the complex jobs which require an awful lot of checking and a a a lot of er a lot er detail because the fee for the job is i is, is higher, and the job complexity is high. Er and we we want to be able to have a mechanism within our I S O Nine Thousand system, which enables us to tackle different jobs of different, different complexity. So that's er essentially this, this morning's er er programme, and the objectives which we want to try and er look at and achieve. First and foremost though, we want to go back to basics and erm get our ideas absolutely straight as regards what quality is and what we're trying to achieve with I S O Nine Thousand. There's a lot of misunderstanding about I S O Nine Thousand and I think that Norman's er analogy a few seconds ago is really, really rather good. If you're asking a civil engineer to do some work for you i if that civil engineer has a degree does it automatically mean that the work's going to be perfect and wonderful? No. It doesn't does it? Erm but there are certain civil engineering activities which e I'm thinking perhaps more about the bridge design side of things really, but there are certain activities which actually demand a certain level of qualification before you, you can actually sign, sign off drawings or a or agree to calculations or whatever. Yes? So the fact that you've got a degree or an H N C, or whatever, is actually a starting point. It it's, it's er a, a level from which you y you er you progress and it's the same with I S O Nine Thousand or five seven five O. It's really no guarantee of perfection, but it's, it's a sort of measure. It is a level, a starting point and perhaps er we'll, we'll pursue this concept during the next er hour or so. Let's, let's look at what quality is in basic terms. We've got somebody from the Oxford English er dictionary compilation er arena, with us today and I, I, I'm almost tempted to ask Clare what wh what, what the definition of the word quality is actually . But do you know what the, what a typical dictionary would give as the definition of quality? We s it's a word we use quite a lot. Wh wh what's, what's the definition of the word? I told you they'd be quiet to start with. Any ideas? What do we mean when we use the word quality in normal day to day language? We use the word often enough don't we? Any ideas? We've got all day, yes. We started early. Come on. Perfect. Excellent. Above average. Excellent. Perfect. Above average. This is great, yes. Any more ideas? The Oxford Dictionary tempers the word excellence, or perfection, with erm a piece of phraseology, degree of. Erm now what's the problem with this definition? If you ask two people to go away and do the same job with a degree of excellence, are you to get the same result at the end of the day? From the two different people? It's not really a very clear definition is it? From a work point of view, degree of excellence, it's, it's too vague. So unfortunately, we're not able to manage quality if we use the dictionary definition of degree of excellence. We need to have something better, or something different. So this is the first problem where w we, we talk about the management of quality. We have to change the definition of the word that we've grown up with over the years, otherwise we really can't manage the concept. And this is where all our problems start. It would have been nice actually if somebody had said, we're not going to have quality management, we're going to have uck management. Or something like that, then we could have of, we could have redefined this, this new word and we wouldn't have had these awful confusions that we get. But what we have to do is completely junk the definition of the word quality that we've grown up with over the years. But we still use the wretched word. So where do we go? Well I think that a number of you might have seen that definition of quality. Have you come across fitness for purpose? One o one or two nods. Thirteen blank looks. Four co one or two people completely disinterested. That's not, that's fair average really isn't it I think . Now this definition, fitness for purpose, erm fits in very nicely with I S O Nine Thousand and the requirements in, in the quality systems standard. Er it's a little bit vague, is fitness for purpose, but it fits in with I S O Nine Thousand quite well because of the con of another little concept. We're talking about concepts rather a lot this morning. How do we find out what the purpose is? If we're going to do er a job? Right. Where do get the specification from? The client. Yeah. The hint behind this phrase is that it wouldn't be a bad idea to talk to the customer, talk to the client. Erm I know this is a bit of shock horror to some of you. I mean the client what do they know about anything? Might as well go and talk to the doorpost as some of your clients, mightn't you? But the theory is that if we, if we get to know what the, the purpose er o o of the job or, or the assignment is, er then we, we stand a slightly better chance of er getting a satisfied client at the end of the day. However, it's still a vague definition and we often find it more useful to er tidy that definition up by introducing, conformance with requirements. So having, having found what the er the purpose of the exercise is, what, what the job is, that we're trying to do, we need to beef up the detail a a and start to define requirements. Now actually this is a very very good definition of the word quality. It's a very good definition, but what are the potential problems with that definition? Requirements have changed. W we've got a problem I think with the word, word requirements, er in several senses and Al Alastair you're absolutely right on that. Er it's a bit like shifting sands at times, isn't it ? And you know very well that as soon as you start to launch yourself into the world of contracting by, by its very nature a contract a a automatically has loopholes in it , and the more you write in a contract the more loopholes you've got. Therefore it's actually quite difficult to define really really accurately requirements. Let me give you another, another example, if you're going to ask people to clean a railway carriage what do you mean by clean? Do you mean inside or outside? Say inside. What do we mean by clean? Well if you're going to ask some poor devil to clean er a carriage out isn't it fair to tell them what it is you mean by clean? What result you want at the end of the day? But what do we do in practice? We just say here's a bucket. Here's a mop. You know, you know what clean is. Get on with that. Well that's not fair is it? Really? On the individual? Because it means you can always criticize the individual, for either not having done the job well enough or for having not done it quite the way you thought it ought to be done. I think that's a good example of where defining requirements is, is quite difficult. And where defining requirements is difficult what tends to happen start with, quite poor teamwork, and there was no That's what, that's how I felt was happening. We were given tasks, but then the tasks had been given to certain people like yourself, starting to want to do the other things, that other people were doing, and then everybody wanted to do instead of doing the tasks that they were set. Yes, that's what I mean. There was quite a lot pressure and half the team weren't listening to what Ian was saying at that so Alright so, there was a bit of competition between Nobody , at the end When we asked for a script from that side from the beginning, it didn't come. Well no because we hadn't , us, given us any ideas, towards the end it got better, and they were. Towards the end it got better and they worked, it was a bad start, but it got better towards the end. And we actually got all the words out. We got the words up there and timed it right and everything and then a rehearsal was done. Okay, okay, thank you very much. It was very confusing,key words, when we started using key words and when we asked because something wasn't there, and we consulted the script, we were still cutting words out, but, at, the script was definite, but sort of like, two of them well they had doubts, and like we started cutting words out, and then like, the words that were out . Ian started on the script , there were some use of that to begin with, the key words a lot, maybe got stuck on the piece of paper because Maybe not according to, We're all pulling together. What about your team Terry? I think you, you're Er, right, everybody seemed , and getting it follow it by, erm, the first stage of the planning, erm, did the manager clearly understand the nature of the situation? Erm, I feel that she'd read the brief but hadn't studied it, because she, she went back to half way through, and er, looked at the objectives. Erm, she established the objective, not autocratically, but democratically, erm, there were all sorts, the resources available,what we have, yes, that's not a problem, but the, at the same time, the rest of the group went to establishing the objective, and there was a lot of over-talking by people, and I feel that she didn't control it and say, look this is what we're going to do now. Then we didn't achieve, we're didn't produce a work plan or organiser, we went straight in, people were hacking out bits of papers, you know, it ended up as a big pile of words you know. So,, he took on the task of er, writing the script off his own bat, he wasn't appointed to it, er, but he stuck with that throughout, and erm, he stuck to his objective. Erm, he organised the coordinating, after a while she did actually stop them after five minutes and explain the time situation, er, the final objective were the constraints. There was no really interaction on that on anybody's part. Er, nobody looked at the time which, which did cause a problem. yes, we did You were looking at the time, but it didn't come up, I mean. We did yes, we mentioned it, I mentioned. Yes, you mentioned it a couple of times, put there was no-one really keeping a watch on the clock. Not, not that I saw. Can I? , , there's eleven minutes to go, and literally everyone starts panicking. You know everyone's like , , It says it really doesn't it? , Alright then, moving on, moving totally on. Yes, er. Alternate feedback. Yes, but not on an on-going basis. It happened a couple of times,, the exercise. If puzzled. Okay, well I did try to motivate them, motivate them to make the most of each person's individual skills. Er, people chose what they wanted to do. Erm, I cheated. Shit, look Joe, you speak to her, you sit and talking across her,, she's talking to Sharon, you know that, that's all the way through it Come on,, alright, alright. I love you too. Erm, Come on Gary. Erm, good point, she did er, give them letters and she told other people to contribute, she erm, she at one stage ask everybody what they, what the record was. Er, the main problem was the time constraint. There was five minutes to go, Right. And we're still, you know, fighting about changing the script and what have you. But they, they did come up with the work on the results, and then they, they did get time to plan it. Right. And they rehearsed it as well. Er, although Shirley, she took over the ro , erm, she took the role half way through of down on the floor splitting things up things over, er, the rest of them were cutting out words and what have you, and writing out the script the way they wanted it, and she just stuck them on the floor,, and they changed the script, so in that respect she was They changed the script once Yes, no, I mean It depends how you , , ah no, but you, but you weren't aware of that because you were on the floor, as I was saying five minutes ago. , I don't want all that over here. Erm, I mean, all in all they did, they did get the final result, the scene came together right from the last eleven minutes to achieve the result, but it was just there was a lot of confusion at the beginning of the start. Right, okay, well thanks very much, if you'd like to get tables back , Is there a pair of scissors anywhere? A pair of scissors? yes. Well quite an interesting exercise I think? , I hope you're not , well several interesting things have come out of there, it just shows the sort of thing about working under pressure, and the limited amount of time, erm, the limited amount of planning time for the managers certainly. Erm, if the man , who were the managers? Ian, you were one,, and Tracy, if you could just say a few words. What did you find were the difficulties and how did it go really? Erm, I thought mine, when I came back and I briefed everybody so that they all knew what was going on Yes Erm, then I think it probably had us confused for a while, whilst we were just trying to decide who should do writing and who should do what, but then I decided I'd chose two people, and then we started cutting things out so then that, that went okay then. Erm, then we all just worked at getting pieces out on paper, all that was going fine, and then I assigned two more people to stick all the pieces together and trying to create sentences from it, and I think the only time that I, we lost it was like, right at the end we were like looking for a few words to make our sentences make sense. And so we were panicking a bit, because we were just trying to get there, but apart from that, I think it went okay. Like we, we didn't have any arguments amongst the group, I mean I was, everybody was quite willing to do everything, everybody was helpful, came up with suggestions. So it was okay. Okay, what about you Ian? No, no go on. What did you think, we actually got on very well, I mean I thought we worked quite well together as a team. We did, yes. yes We erm, given that you have to do, okay, I didn't brief them as fully as I could of, and half way through I looked at it again just to make sure I hadn't missed the bottom line that said, you know stand on your head instead in the park, so I just had a little read. And we made within two minutes to sort out what we were going to, or we decided what charity first, then we decided two would decide on the script while the others cut out relevant pieces that we thought might be useful words. And then when the sc , we had a look at the script and we changed it a little bit, and then we all went, they were cutting out words, so we were doing, the first few all three ways, and we'd look and say, okay, so it was a scrambled mess as we all looked through for three words and ended up with , and I got down on the floor, so we knew where we were. And then we changed things like the name because we found somebody's name in all these words, somebody , and we just sellotaped it down, and at the end when we were running out of time, and we did about three times have a look at the time, we did change the script slightly to fit the words that we'd found so we had responsibilities instead of, I don't know what it was, but instead of another words, just because we'd found it. And we just changed it again. But once I think we were, we were going in a mad rush er, each saw his responsibilities for that word, and that'll do, and then we'd say yes, and stuck it here. In terms of managing the time, did you feel it worked quite well? yes, I mean we got the end result, Yes Okay we changed a few words just to fit the words we could find, but yes, we, we had about a minute at the end, we read it through, and yes, it was fine. I thought we worked alright together. Okay. Sorry, can I just make one small comment on that? Pardon? Can I just , You, you did actually, again it's the time thing, yes. Originally you weren't really looking at it, five of you all fell into the same trap, you know, they, they get half way through, and they did have something to do and they did sort of start rushing. , Okay then, let's leave that there, and then talked about that at tea, and you can have a talk about it then. Come on Ian. Well I have to admit, with our group, the first ten minutes or was a little bit disorganised because I felt we, I came in, we set down the objects, I felt we did that well, and we were clear of the timescale from the very beginning. We decided quite soon which charity we were going to go for, and we divided up. I mean, I had Tony to go through and find key words that we knew we were going to need, you know, simple words like the, of, with, a, that sort of thing, that we knew that okay, we wouldn't use immediately, but we'd look, ah there that goes there, and use it straight away. Erm, we set tasks that erm, two people were supposed to be working on the script while two people looked through the paper. Now I think what te , what happened there was we er, we drifted away from setting down sc , er, er, scripts to finding good useful key words and phrases out of the paper that we could then fit into the script, and as it had gone that way, I realised it was working, and didn't see any point in trying to get it back to the way it was originally going, because it was going fine. Erm, we had an example advert early on that we actually read through, for the simple reason of finding how long it was going to take, so we had a target as to how long we needed the advert to be very early on and we could work to that. Erm, we carried on, er, it got better as it went on. Tony wasn't impressed a little bit, but a little, a little gee up and we were away again. Erm, I felt that er, we had plenty of time at the end, I mean we, we tried only three times to get it right, and it was okay, and I felt we worked well as a team in that amount of time. Alright well, generally then I think from hearing what you're saying, erm, some good points, some perhaps things that you'd do differently next time, and then what it obviously says about you is that, you're all managers and you all have different styles, and you possibly do things in different ways. And you've been in a scenario where there's one manager and there's a few people who aren't in a managing role, but you are actually managers , maybe they'd like a little reversal, I mean, I think some good things have come out of that, and possibly things that you'd do better next time. We all achieved the target Yes, you all did really well . Yes, thank you Stephen. Yes, perhaps you'd We all achieved the end result. Everyone's just trying the same situation. And they thought Yes, patches of chaos, possibly in the disorganisation, but you got there in the end. Erm, I think what we'll do now is have a quick cup of tea, a nice friendly, smiley , cup of tea, And then I want you to meet, I want you to be back here by quarter to four. It's called time , it gives you a little space at the top so you can fill in what you feel to be your role, and if you can fill below, all the tasks in respective order that you do in a typical day. Right, so a complete brainstorm, and we'll start again, and we'll come back to those in a little while. We're going to spend the rest of the session on time management. We're going to talk about three methods of managing your time. The first of those is delegation, a much talked about subject. Erm, how many of you delegate? Yes Yes, the vast majority? How do you go about that, and what sort of things do you delegate? I look at all the jobs that's got, that have to be done in the day, right, and look at which ones I should do, and then all the other jobs I just share out between the relevant people. Right, is there any kind of pattern to that, or is it on a daily basis that you do that? No, certain things, certain specific jobs are set to certain people. Such as? That are on-going. One of my, my senior section manager does till results, anything to do with till results, my section manager does scheduling. Another section manager does something else, and they do that every week. Okay, does that, and you find that that works well? Mm, very well. Er, what kind of checks to do have, do you have to keep on that? About once every week I'll check that everything's been done. Well, with the scheduling obviously it's checked every day, but erm, things like till results, I check every week to make sure it's been, if she's been, but she's really good so, so I just have to check up. What they did at a branch on our district erm, again it was just like set up, people were given specific tasks, but at the end of the three month cycle, they'd change some people, er, those people's tasks so that they, so they wouldn't get stagnant, and plus, if one person was off, if you happened to be on holiday, you've got somebody else that can do the job at the standard and not let the standard fall. So you're not just reliant on one person, and if that person's away you're stuck. Anybody else delegate? Delegates? I think everybody does throughout the course of the day without even realising anyway, do they? Certainly, the only go , the only way I run a shift , the way she runs checkouts, is erm, by going, you, it's the same thing every day, you've got to run through everything on the same point order, because you know, you've been doing it, it's got to be done at the same time, like bread the last lot's got to be on by four. Erm, so you, it's one of the second, third things to look at when I, I start at three fifteen, it's the third thing I do. The first thing I do is check the stocks, followed by date returns and er, you know, erm, get that done,out of the way, and start looking at the , of the night , and what have you, setting that up, and maybe the late night process, hand over from the branch manager, walk round doing any detail he wants me to do, and hand over from late nights. Department managers, new checkouts, do all the bits and pieces on , and wanted me to do, while I wait for the shift to come in, and they start at seven. Er, keep an eye on them, I'll have a bit of replenishment here and then, erm, so he's, until eight o'clock, and then you get everything pulled out. Erm, replenishment until ten o'clock, er, get the warehouse , get the clear-out underway. So where do you actually delegate within that? To the er, because there's no other management in the place, you just delegate to another member of staff. And is that er, do you have one person that you allocate specific tasks or do you go on a daily basis. Er, it's like, it's like the foreman on the shopfloor for some reason, there's a er, in the systems or whatever, er, the warehouseman er, the night porter er, when he takes over, he knows what he's doing, he knows what I want, because I've spoken to him about it, erm, he knows what items I want to leave for stock people, erm, and Sue, the checkout manager, she'll know if I want extra people on the shopfloor because we're quiet, or I expect it to be quiet, erm, she knows where they've got to be, and I'll come back and review it with her. Okay, anybody else delegate? Yes, well how do you do it Teddy? Well it's, you go in in the morning, and it's the same jobs every day really basically. Erm, the , I first tell people what to do because they all know their roles, and when you go in in the morning, and you're just basically going round checking that they've already done it all. Okay Erm, if there's something needs doing extra you just ask the person who's best for the job to sort it out and to do it for you. So your role is more a checking and writing one, similar to what Helen. Yes, well with the staff I've got, yes, they're all there. At night-times I've got my jobs to get stuck into on the shopfloor as well, just hope that everybody works as a strong team basically. Yes, does anybody here not delegate? I did delegate, but I won't do it now, I do literally Say that again, I missed that. Er, I sorry,, just clearing my throat, er, I did, I did delegate if somebody put it on the end of somebody's assignment, then I to it, but I tend to find I underestimate what people can do for me all the time, and don't identify just how much those people can give me back, and I did, or I do have a tendency at times to give people like before, to hold on too much, try and do too much myself, and er, you can't do it that way in case. But once you've, you've got to know your people better, develop your people better. Right. It's something I've got to work on. To decide for yourself what they're capable of. Why, does anybody else find difficulty with delegating. No, I was just going to say that if, if you try it once, you know, you know if they can do it, they'll be . Oh, yes. I was going to say, I like to set somebody task as they're down for, and I look for it, and nine times out of ten you'll find out if they can achieve that very shortly, very fast. And if they cannae cope with it, they'll come to, or the majority will come and say look I cannae do it. If it's something silly, that they haven't been trained for, but most jobs you can delegate and they'll do it just as well as you. It's just a matter of having confidence in them to do that. Since, since Norwich, you just can't delegate like erm, you just ha , you don't have any other management there, only section managers, and you delegate that job to er, supervisors, erm, it's a very on-hands management situation. You can delegate to anybody can't you. You can delegate your staff as well. Yes, yes, fair enough, but erm, Depending on the task, it depends what the job is. Yes, I mean, like I mean making late payments, I'm delegating people to fill up those late payment. Okay, it's delegation, but it's not erm, the sort of like, a responsible job if you see what I mean, it's a job that they're employed to do anyway, but it's not a separate sort of task. Yes, okay. What's the difference between delegating and abdicating? Delegate erm, you can delegate the job, but you can't delegate the responsibility. Right, so when you delegate, what are you delegating? Specific tasks, the physical But when you delegate that task is there anything that you retain? The responsibility that it's being done right. Right, and who is ultimately accountable? Yourself. Yes, right, okay. When we're talking about delegating tasks, I think tasks can be almost categorised into two clear sections. Has anybody heard about how tasks can be categoried? I think they mentioned it on the video. Urgent and important. Right, then there's that which we're going to come onto in a minute It's active, isn't it, instead of reactive Reactive, yes. Can you erm, explain what a reactive task is, Tracy? It's something you haven't got planned into your day, isn't it, it's something that comes up, and you, you have to respond to it, so you have to have time between the day, to be able to do those things. Okay, can you give an example? Erm, it's like to keep my day planned out but, like the district manager might walk in or people might go off sick, and then you have to fill somebody in to that position. Things that you just don't think are going to happen So you act Especially management goes down ill or something. Okay, so they're unexpected can you thing of any, er, another kind of way of erm, other tasks that possibly could be described as reactive tasks? I've got customer experience. Pardon? Customer experience. So you've got customer query, or something like that. yes The bakery , and you're expecting a delivery, especially like on produce, and then you have to go off , or something like that, get people stacking right up. Okay, what about erm, if the opposite, I mean if we've got reactive tasks, what's the opposite of that? Proactive Proactive, or possibly just active. And how would you describe an active task? Something you do every day anyway. Right so they're regular, Regular, yes. What do they do for your department? I mean that, can you think of examples of active tasks? cleaning, checks Till checks, right, interesting that you should say that. Erm, just filling up shelves. yes, interesting you should say that, because the definition I had was something quite the reverse. Many of these are planned for, isn't it, you might do it every day, but you've planned for it, Right, So you, you'll be able to do it every Monday, but you've planned for it on Monday, you know who's going to do it, and they, you know, it's set up. Okay, so it's something right. The way I would possibly define active and reactive, I would see active as things that actually take your department forward a step. They are things that you do which actually improve your department both in the short and in the long-term. The long-term specifically. Things like okay, ordering possibly could be reactive and active, because yes, it's something that has to be done every day, but if your order in spot on, that is an active task, it would improve and benefit to your, you would say that that,. Whereas reactive, I think one typical task that's a reactive task which is yes, it's unexpected or whatever, is cardboard collecting, because it's the type of thing that happens regularly, but it doesn't actually get your department, it doesn't It doesn't achieve anything. No, in a day you do now, then later you've got to do it again. It's one of those mundane tasks. yes I mean, can you think of any, I mean, putting that kind of interpretation on it, can you think of anything else other than cardboard collecting. Tidying the cabinets, dressing them down . solids. Do you often find yourself doing these tasks? All day long. All day long, right. And most of the night. One, I think one of the tasks that you find branch managers doing on a fairly regular basis is collecting cardboard. What? Some of them do. My branch manager does it all the time. Yes, my branch manager does it all the time, yes, it's his regular way out. It's escapism. Escapism, exactly, you've hit the nail on the head there Dee, escapism. It's a comfort blanket, that's what it is, when you see your branch manager collecting cardboard, it's usually because he's feeling a bit stressed out. No, it's just because he's lazy. It could be just because he's lazy. Alright, what about, when you mentioned as well, we've got reactive and we've got active tasks. What about, you said something about, somebody mentioned important and urgent tasks? Who said that? I did. Yes, what do you see as those being? Well urgent tasks would be tasks that are done at that time, to complete them. So urgent equals time Equals time limit. limit and I mean, urgent is now isn't it, Yes It's to be done A S A P. What about important? Important, it has to be done, but it's not as, it's not as important as the urgent. Is that, is that right, what do the rest of think? No, it needs to be done but it's something that It needs to be done but do you know what I mean, if you don't your important things on time they become urgent yes, yes. No, because things come up unexpectedly, so things will become urgent that maybe you didn't think were important, but have just suddenly emerged. Do you know what I mean? Unexpected things that emerging you have to do there and then, like The whole day's important isn't it? The whole day's important. Yes, everything, a lot of things are important, and what you're saying is true Alex, that if you do the important things when you should do them, they won't become urgent, but equally what Tracy says is that, is true is that you will get unexpected things cropping up where you have to drop everything. I tell what is urgent is a message coming down to you, you've had a delivery team, they're going to destroy cases of whatever, so that's urgent, that has to be done there and then because it's a danger to the public or whatever. So that's important. And then you've got emergencies. How long, I mean, how, in terms of, in terms of time that you spend on urgent or important tasks, how long do you think an urgent task may take? Not long, not very long. So it's relatively short? And what about important? You might take your time on that, more time. So it could be something that's rather time consuming? Can things be both urgent and important. What can you think of that possibly is? Well your could be important first thing in the morning today, as you're sidetracked into doing other things, then it becomes urgent doesn't it, if you've had to reposition your , and whatever. Right. What I'd like you to do, is to have a look at your time , one, and first of all see notes down on it, make a note beside each task that you've got on there, whether it's active or reactive. Bearing in mind that active are things that take your time forward, in the long-term, reactive are things like scale checks, you know you're daily, fairly monotonous tasks like that. Aren't some, some of them both? Sorry? Aren't some of them both? Er, that's a possibility yes? You know you could say these scale checks, they're , but they're still urgent to be done. The, they're still, they're, they're not active in that they don't actually progress your department do they? If your scales are wrong you're not progressing are you? No, but we're not, we're not arguing that they're not working. Just classify them as being reactive and active, by them. Totally monotonous It tends to be the case that when a task is identified as being reactive you can usually delegate it down, because it's very, it's a monotonous, everyday task, it doesn't actually move the department forward. It's not strictly a managerial task. Has anybody got any reactive tasks on their lists? Yes Yes Well shout out a few. Not, not as many as active though, because you could say that stock checks and checks are reactive because you're doing it every day but, stock checks move the department forward on your stock reports. Right. But you could delegate it down couldn't you. I mean, I would say the overseeing of that, and trying to improve your stock results erm, as a key result area, is the active part of it, but the actual everyday doing those checks, you can delegate that down. So reactive, you delegate down I would have said in the, in the large part. Why have you got any down there? Butchering's a tasty part of , if I wanted to do anything I'd take a leaf out of, I would say is that, but I delegate down through the butchers. Cutting meat? Do you like it? Yes. Would you say that cutting meat and getting it on the shelf every day, takes your department forward? Yes, yes. It's just an everyday task. I would agree with you yes, An everyday task is something that you have to do every day, so No, no I'd agree with you, because to me pricing is, is active or whatever it is You couldn't wait, That's priority, that's got to be. No it isn't because it's a day to day activity. Yes but it's all based down on cutting more. What you've done is there, you've, you've, you've done your cutting programme, and then you delegate, yes, but the actual cutting, give that to the butchers. Yes. So the programme's the bit that you do, and then to them basically just cutting it, while it's still down, you were still , the awkward thing is both Which bit are you doing Kenny, you do the actual, you plan the, what did you call it? The? The cutting programme. The cutting programme, and you cut the meat. I cut the meat, yes. But do you cut meat? Yes, Friday and Saturday I do. But why? Delegate to someone else? Because we haven't got the staff to do it. Right. It's the same for the provisions manager, they have the same kind of thing isn't it. But it could be delegated. Cut meat brings my department forward, and if I don't cut that meat, and don't build up slowly upwards, therefore my department's going to stand still isn't it? What do the rest of you think? I agree with him, I agree. I mean do you think that the actual cutting of the meat should be a managerial task? No No, I don't, but who else is going to do it, if I don't do it? Yes, I agreed. Okay, we've got two issues here. If you've got a situation where you're the only person around well yes, obviously you're going to have to do it, and you can't, you're not in a position where you're able to delegate. But I would have said that something like cutting meat, if you've got butchers around, it's not something that you would be, you should be spending your time doing. That is normal, it happens all the time. You, if you had something more to do, you wouldn't be cutting meat though? I'd rather be, on Sundays, cutting meat, wrapping meat, packing meat,and doing the same for everybody else. Yes there's a situation where you get There's nobody else there. Yes, but we, we're talking about the days when you do have other people available, what would you spend your time doing? Cutting meat. That excuses my question, like you're going down your priorities, you take , and in the low branches, we still have the same old jobs to do, there's the stocktaking, X thousands of pounds. Yes, oh no, I agree with that, but when you're cutting the meat, what are your butchers doing? My butchers are not there. No but we're talking about the days when your butchers are there. What am I doing then, I'm filling the shelves. What does the rest of you think? Think they like, cutting meat isn't taking his department forward, it's an everyday activity. If he took more staff on and they were say filling up provisions, putting the pies out every day is taking the department forward, it's an everyday task. Order it correctly in the first place. Right. If the manager's department. If you order it correctly, then your staff can function on a daily basis. It's when you don't order it correctly, it's when you go wrong. If you get your books right, it'll all happen on the shopfloor. Say that again? If you get your books right, it'll all happen out on the shopfloor, all the manager has to do. Because that's what you're expecting them to do. Yes, but that's not, not what a regional manager's supposed to do. A regional manager spends more time , you know, okay, it's a little bit longer, I deal with more lines than you, the pressure is far , you know, every branch manager I know, the guy's got to believe that they'll get staff from somewhere, it's just as long as they get the order in and the availability right. Does anybody else have reactive tasks on their list? I've had during the week which are shopfloors, bullets, that sort of thing. Which tasks do you have Donna? Thing like checking recipes through the post, and things like that. So a lot of mine are reactive because I just haven't got any staff. No, but if you had the staff, I mean we're talking about a hypothetical situation, would you still try doing that? No, I'd give that up any day. Okay, does anybody find themselves doing reactive tasks when possibly they do have the staff? yes There are certain things like active, that I actually do throughout the branch as well. I mean I could quite easily delegate it out, but I can't because it's a management function, so , I've got to be the one that's got to walk round the branch for half an hour, taking twelve blocks off, checking all the sealed . So that's actually within procedure that you have to do that. Yes it is. Okay, so that's obviously you're then able to delegate. I think you're, you're often asked to do reactive tasks when I've done all my tasks, you know I've got all my staff doing this, and then I've got to help down on the shopfloor, and it's not that I'm doing something that I'm, you know, I should be doing as a manager, it's that I've done all of mine, and I'm going out to give them a hand. If I had, if I had more pressing tasks personally, I wouldn't be doing it. yes. I think erm, shifts differ slightly through other departments, in the sense that it is only there for one day. The only thing that you can really do to take yourself forwards in a shift situation is your scheduling for the following week. You know, er, right look at previous weeks, with, you know, er, branch to mind the er, the account for the kind of day is er, the account is probably pretty much the same as it was the previous week. There's very little chance of it catching unawares. Er, but I mean, everything you do is, is designed to set yourself up in the best possible position for when the staff come in and, and throughout the shift leaving it as best you can for the branch manager the next day. It, it's all reactive to that day, in that there's very, very little in carrying you forward. Yes, some of the departments, some department managers I think have more erm, their goals tend to be more short-term possibly than longer term. Yes, the same thing is like erm, if I do , the rest of the shop for the rest of the d , that day, but I do goods the next night, erm, that shop's okay for the next day, and it's, it's only like on a one day basis. Mm, yes, okay. So active is a job that gets done on a daily basis every day? No No, not necessarily , no, an active task is something that takes your department forward, actively improves the way your department runs, which could be something like. interest rates, will Britain do the same? And twentieth Century technology rebuilds the glory that was Rome. police have launched a murder enquiry following the killing of a community policeman and another man in South London last night. P C Patrick Dunn had been called to a minor disturbance at a house in Clapham. In what police say was a tragic coincidence, gunfire was heard from a house across the street. He went to investigate and was murdered. His killers are said to have run off laughing. The other man was found dead nearby, he too had been shot in what may have been a drugs related killing. Police are tonight questioning three men. Home beat police constable Patrick Dunn didn't have to deal with the reported disturbance last night, at twenty eight Cato Road Clapham, but knowing the area, he said he'd go, on his bicycle as ever. While there he heard shots from across the road at number thirty one, stepped out to investigate and by what the Metropolitan police Commissioner called a tragic coincidence of events, was shot dead almost immediately by one of three men. Another man, apparently the victim of a drugs dispute, had been shot dead inside thirty one. A police surveillance operation had been taking place at the house, though not last night. Patrick Dunn was unmarried, forty four and came to the police late after a teaching career. As floral tributes built up, it became evident how much he was held in affection and esteem by local people. He was loved so much, it's unbelievable that it's happened. It really is. He helped everybody in the local community. You know, in my opinion it's like I've lost one of my own family. P C Dunn's boss, the Metropolitan police Commissioner, paid this tribute to the dead constable. He was a good, honest, kind, gentle local bobby. Er doing what the Met does best, doing what British policing does best, working with his local community. He was a total gentleman. There's just there's just no other words to describe them. A man who cared about what he did. A very well liked man in the community, a very well liked man at the station and erm I I can't speak highly enough of the man. This afternoon, P C Dunn's brother Ivan described Patrick's qualities. He could deal with people, erm he could communicate with people, he was always there to help with our problems and I'm sure he felt that he could help erm you know the community and and the beat that on which he was a home beat officer. In his earlier career, Patrick Dunn taught maths and was responsible for the welfare of fifth formers at this school in Bolton. A former colleague explained why he left for the police. He noticed as we'd all noticed that in in respect of law and order that things were really going from bad to worse, were deteriorating. And it concerned him an awful lot and it it it irritated him and frustrated him and I think he set his sights on trying to do something about it in his his way. This afternoon in Stockwell near the murder scene, three men were spotted in a Nissan car by a police foot patrol following a tip off. They were stopped and arrested in a brief operation involving thirty police. The vehicle was taken away for forensic tests. This evening the men arrested are being questioned and police have appealed for witnesses who may have seen three men running from the area of the shooting last night. Laurie Margolis, B B C News, Clapham, South London. Police say a battle for territory between crack cocaine dealers has been behind a series of recent shootings in South London. There have been four drugs related killings in the area this year. P C Dunn's murder has again raised the question of whether more police should carry firearms. Although Cato Road in Clapham is not a known haunt of crack dealers, police suspect it's the violence associated with this drug in particular, which has now claimed two more lives including that of a policeman. The officer leading the murder hunt, used to head a special ongoing operation in South London, against so called yardie gangs from Jamaica. Over the past three years, raids have been carried out as police target crack dealers who've been behind many shootings and violent assaults. There have already been four drug related murders in South London this year, and more than seventy incidents involving firearms. Experience in the capital and Manchester has shown, the level of violence linked to crack, make it very different from other drug trafficking. What we've had in parts of London are so called turf wars between crack crack dealers, crack sellers, fighting for territory. And we believe that several murders have been as a result of that sort of tension. The police response to the increasing number of criminals prepared to use guns, has been to train firearms specialists and make sure they're available all the time at short notice. In that sense, Britain already has an armed police force. But drugs related crime is posing an ever bigger challenge. Individual chief constables may in the light of particular circumstances, consider that their drugs officers should in fact be armed and that is for the decision for as I say the individual chief officer. So there could be cases where officers on particularly dangerous assignments, need to be armed and in which case, they will be armed. Few would favour police officers being armed as a matter of routine, but work at the sharp end is undoubtedly becoming sharper. It reminds us of the deadly risks which our police officers run on on our behalf, day and night. Er and I would want to express my deepest sympathy to police constable Dunn's family. Er I'm sure that er the Metropolitan Police will be doing everything possible to track down those who are responsible for this evil act and bring them to justice. Many police officers will want to remind the Home Secretary as he prepares his response to the Sheahy report that they take special risks and deserve special treatment. Neil Bennet, B B C News. Another man was shot dead in London this afternoon, it happened outside Shepherd's Bush underground station. The victim, who's not been identified, was hit in the chest and died shortly afterwards. His attacker ran off. The area has been sealed off and police marksmen have surrounded a local shop. No motive has been established for the attack. The chief inspector of prisons, Judge Stephen Tumim, has published a damning report into the causes of the riot at Wymott prison in Lancashire last month. He said the prison was close to anarchy and it was widely known that there was a strong risk of violence. It's estimated that the riot at the low security jail caused damage costing twenty million pounds. The Wymott disturbances lasted eight hours. Four hundred prisoners were involved in the worst prison rioting since Strangeways. Fortunately no-one was seriously hurt and no inmate escaped but the risk of trouble had been spotted and little done to stop it. That night, just seven prison officers were coping with seven hundred and fifty inmates, many violent street gang criminals, involved with drugs and too dangerous for a low security jail. There'd been incidents of violence between gangland type er warfare between inmates. Manchester, Liverpool don't get on very well and there was a drugs problem, a very bad drugs problem er which had been brought in from their normal way of life outside. The rioters wrecked accommodation blocks, workshops, and classrooms. it will cost up to twenty million pounds to repair the destruction. Judge Tumim went to inspect the jail next day, and he said his overwhelming impression was of the powerlessness of Wymott staff in the face of organized criminal activity. In his report, Judge Tumim said the prison had been very close to anarchy in the months before the riot. He said his original inspection had found a world of drugs, drug dealing and bullying. And he described Wymott as, No more than an open prison with a fence around it. Tonight the prison service reacted to Judge Tumim's report. Of his forty seven recommendations for action at Wymott, thirty five were already being put into effect. No further building will be commissioned without cellular accommodation. So in other words, all new accommodation will be of a cellular type. But it's the it's the present estate if you like, that will take us time. Government figures released today show that like Wymott at the time of the riot, nearly a third of prisons in England and Wales are overcrowded, several housing seventy percent more prisoners than they were designed for. But the prison service sees the underlying problem of drugs in the jails like Wymott, as a priority and action has already been initiated. John Thorne, B B C News, Wymott Prison. Business leaders here have welcomed an unexpected cut in Germany's main interest rate. The Bundesbank reduced its discount rate by a half of one percent to five point seven five percent. The move should help stimulate economies on the continent where recession has been weakening the market for British exports. Germany's rate is now below Britain's and that's adding to pressure for a cut in rates here. The news boosted shared prices to a new record. The Bundesbank has never been an institution to bow to public pressure. It's been slow to cut interest rates, believing Germany's four percent inflation is too high. But with inflation there on its way down and the economy bumping along the bottom of a recession, the Bundesbank Council decided it could tolerate another downward step. The city welcomed the move, believing the rate cut'll be followed throughout Europe, particularly on the continent where German decisions still dominate economic policy making. Despite pressure from its European partners, Germany has only reduce its rates very slowly. While Britain was in the E R M until September last year, our interest rates could never knowingly undercut those of Germany. But when we left, our rates fell and they fell quickly. Today's move means though that he German discount rate is below our base rate for the first time in a year. So will Britain now follow the Germans down? This latest cut does shift the balance of arguments in favour of reducing U K rates but there are other factors that the Chancellor will need to take into account. If the recovery is faltering he'll clearly want to be more keen to cut interest rates, and also he'll want to take into account the effect of any tax increases he may introduce in his budget. A rate cut would not be an easy decision. The Bank of England which has less influence than its German counterpart has been reluctant to advise rate cuts over here. The Bank is worried about inflation which has been edging up recently. On the other hand, industry wants rates cut. Car production and trade figures released today, highlight the difficulties that British manufacturers are having in selling their products overseas. Lower interest rates would keep the pound down and keep exports competitive. Most of the advice Kenneth Clarke's receiving is to cut rates, his job now is to decide whether Britain's economy is more in danger of boiling over or going off the boil completely. Evan Davies, B B C News. British U N Soldiers at a base in Central Bosnia have been forced to move out under heavy mortar fire. More than two thirds of the troops at have withdrawn from the town leaving around seventy soldiers there. The attack was launched by Croat soldiers on Muslim positions in which is on the front line between the opposing sides. The main British base is thirty miles away Vitez. From the area, our correspondent Alan Little reports. It began with seven mortar rounds in quick succession, then shelling, often at the rate of one a minute for five hours with no let-up. Take a look at the cook house, one British truck driver said, It's history. An artillery shell struck here at breakfast time, but by now the base was on red alert, its soldiers under cover. No-one was hurt. Shortly after seven o'clock this morning the Bosnian Croats launched and attack on one of the suburbs of er and there was some intense fighting er in and around the Unprofor base. We've evacuated er two thirds of the base er to a more secure area. We'll just sit out the present fighting and see what happens. Others were less sanguine. These civilian truck drivers were among more than a hundred evacuated to safer positions. They were glad to be out. The Bosnian army were being pounded, they said. soldiers down in a a wheelbarrow. All the dead soldiers. I've never seen anything like it in my life. I don't want to see it again really. A hundred and twenty eight soldiers and civilian staff were moved out on the order of the base commander, some showing the signs of their ordeal. It is not the first time the British have found themselves in the path of an offensive, it is the first time they've evacuated, in such numbers and with such urgency. lies on the most important aid route into Central Bosnia, which is why the British are here. But while the battle goes on, the aid does not get through, and in Central Bosnia, a million and a half people depend upon it. Alan Little, B B C News, near . A woman who was in danger of losing her home after she mortgaged it as security for her husband's business debts, has won the right to keep it following a victory in the House of Lords. Five Law Lords said, Banks must warn wives and partners of the risks they're taking before granting loans. Bridget O'Brien's been fighting attempts by Barclay's Bank to repossess her home for five years and her legal victory was welcomed by others with similar problems. The Law Lords found that she should have been fully informed by the bank that she was risking her whole house by guaranteeing a loan to her husband's business, not the limited amount she believed at the time. And if some of you can do well out of it and it will help you keep your homes, because at the end of the day, without our home, where are we? This is what it's all about. Mrs O'Brien here at her home in Slough, was told by her husband that the loan back in nineteen eighty seven was only for sixty thousand pounds, the bank didn't correct this or give her independent advice. The debt rose to a hundred and fifty thousand pounds and the bank obtained a repossession order. Today's judgement means that banks in future must make sure a spouse or partner is directly informed of risks. The judgement could help others whose homes are under threat for similar reasons. It's affected my health, it's affected my family and erm everyday it's there. You don't know whether y you just don't know what the future holds. Banks now urge customers to seek independent legal advice before signing guarantees. Banks haven't been pulling the wool over people's eyes by not telling them. In fact for many years, the banks have been telling people to seek legal independent advice er since March nineteen ninety two, this has been a requirement of all loans. Today's Law Lords judgement should keep Bridget O'Brien in her house, it will also mean that in future, a wife or partner only agrees to mortgage their home as security for a loan after being fully informed of the possible consequences. Wesley Kerr, B B C News, at the House of Lords. And the time is six sixteen and still to come, parents and teachers protest over plans to cut help for pupils whose first language isn't English. And farm workers complain that sheep dips are damaging their health. Hundreds of parents and teachers have lobbied Parliament to protest about the government's plan to cut help for pupils whose first language isn't English. Campaigners say, four thousand specialist teaching jobs could go if the government reduces the grant for teaching English as a foreign language. This is going to be your drum, now what about another drumstick? Have you got Anne Redding is a section eleven teacher, funded by a Home office scheme to promote racial equality, introduced by section eleven of the local government act. She works alongside the class teacher, helping pupils who don't speak English as their first language. Almost all the children in this school in Newham, East London, need help with their English. Children here don't lack any sort of ability it's because th they English isn't their first language so they need support in learning English to help them with the everyday necessities of the national curriculum. The government meets three quarters of the costs of section eleven projects, but that's being cut to half over the next two years. in Newham, that could mean shedding over a quarter of its section eleven teachers. Educationalists say that'll damage all pupils since, without support, class teachers won't be able to teach the rest of the class so effectively. The effect on a school would be devastating erm the school has already lost one teacher, the s the actual demand is increasing erm if we were to lose yet another teacher then what would we would be denying is education to the children, the best possible education. Which is what we're trying to provide. Today, lobbyists gathered at Westminster warning thousands of section eleven jobs are threatened nationally, but the Home Office says painful decisions are necessary in the current public spending round. At a time of heightened racial tension, cuts in English language support teaching are particularly sensitive. many ear that when the Home office cuts its grant from next April, local authorities won't be able to make up the shortfall. Mike Baker, B B C News, East London. Joh Commonwealth leaders have been attending the first day of their summit in Cyprus and protests by Greek Cypriots. Thousands of women formed a human chain along the route to Nicocea, where the opening ceremony was held, to protest against the Turkish occupation against the North of the island. The summit will spend the next four days discussing issues ranging from the division of Cyprus to the war in Bosnia. The Greek Cypriot hosts have hijacked the conference agenda. Government heads driving to the Nicocea opening found the fifty mile route lined with women, hands linked in protest at the world's and especially Britain's failure to reverse the nineteen seventy four invasion which has left thirty seven percent of the island in Turkish hands. Inside the conference hall, delegates were greeted with a highly unusual presentation mixing potent T V images of Hitler and the Holocaust, with flashbacks to that Turkish invasion. Some resented President Clarides' propaganda coup, but other delegation heads were immediately swayed. Why can't the same methods that were used by the Commonwealth yesterday vis a vis Rhodesia, vis a vis Namibia and vis a vis South Africa, not be applied in respect of the colonial and settlerist situation here. Elsewhere, with many teachers engaged in the fifty mile protest, hundreds of youngsters used their day out to protest at the green line barrier separating Greek and Turkish communities. Penetrating no man's land in a fracas which left three British U N peace keeping soldiers injured, before tear gas from the Greek police dispersed them. Later John Major urged Commonwealth heads to drive on world trade talks and pledged a crusade to ease poor countries debts. Apartheid arguments over, the Commonwealth's now seeking a new role spreading democracy, but the assembly lacks stars and so far the Cypriots have stolen the show. Robin Oakley, B B C News, Cyprus. John Prescot has been given one of the key posts in the new shadow cabinet. He moves from transport to employment, swapping jobs with Frank Dobson. But Harriet Harman stays as shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, despite being voted off the shadow cabinet by her fellow M Ps. Our political correspondent John Sople, reports from Westminster. For John Prescot today, not a discrete silence while waiting for the leader's call, he was making it clear that he wanted a swap to one of the top economic jobs. And having saved John Smith's skin at the Labour party Conference, with his rumbustious performance in the one member, one vote debate, Mr Prescot knew he was in a position to call in his debts. But tonight the new employment spokesman is putting a rather more modest gloss on it. Well I didn't demand job, nobody demands of John Smith. But I wanted to do employment, I want to get on with this kind of job, it's going to be a major political issue, and by God I'm gonna put it right up front. The prediction had been that these elections would look at this as the baseline and decide how we might amend it to keep common factors in that we can all use, because we need something that has a common denominator level Mm. in. Is that, is that I did that, I did that with . Right. You Mm. one of the things you said, Angela was that there wasn't enough comment on the original one, wasn't Aha. enough room so I the size of that because of that Yeah. more room But I've , what I'm saying Rod is I've done the same thing Sorry Angela! because Yeah, I'm trying to put the excuse I haven't been I haven't presented it as well Don has. Right. But I've done a generalised thing that could be adapted. Right. I think this is very good one! Ah oh yeah, I like that, I like it, yep! Erm, just picking little bits, I mean er,we when we say actually what it is erm, annual report do we say the annual report to parents, or is it annual report just I know that that's minor but at the actual top what do we actually call the thing that we're presenting? I think, I, I would actually prefer to leave the word annual out and just put I dunno what you wanna call it, I'd I'm always edgy about the word report Well Ralph Gardener Yes. Community High School, yeah. It will be Ralph Gardener Community High Yeah. School that's the first thing. Yeah. Do we need to put on what it is? I mean, is it not almost explanatory? Yes, we we do need to put it on. We do need to put it on. I'm looking for Bill, is he around anywhere? Bill? P E. P E. And they're in room one which is down past Okay! wherever something! In the past we've used different terms haven't we? We we we went to statement to parents! Refuse and this,tha you know! To deliberately move away from the idea of the old reporting format that's why we've used the word statement to parents. I mean that box on the left hand side there could be Ralph Gardener Community High School and where it says science or maths or whatever Yeah. above that could be report for and then science you know? What's wrong with just a title, science or Oh okay then! It seems quite clear I thought I wo I understand that you preferred the word report to be there? Well ah, no! Didn't say the word report Sorry! No, he didn't say that, no. I think that an indication of what the sheet is Yes. for the benefit of Mm. whoever might pick the sheet up. So, Ralph Gardener Community High School, hyphen and, I would say annual out because Mm. Mhm. it might well be May not be annual! Right Mm. Mhm. and we either go with the word report or we look for an alternative word or words. What is what is the, what is the, is assessment not the word to use these days? Mm. No, it's not a report is it? cos if we're reporting, we're not assessing. Mhm. It is a report to parents and I mean, under legislation we have to report report to parents. Well I mean I I was That's just looking at that one where we said well report to parents Annual report to parents , yeah. you know, and is that is that satisfactory? Well that Or do we want to call it something different? In that case should call it subject report? Subject report instead of annual got enough space in there only make it small. Do we need subject report in if you're going, I'm sorry if we're spli , if you're gonna have a box with you're subject name in? Cos it's obvious Mhm. that it's a subject report, if you've got report Yes. right, says science or art and design or whatever Well just put report! Report will do. And leave the title next to it. Yes. Yeah. okay. But will the Altho , although if one is eventually going to talk about the report one could to make it clear to the parents that what one is a subject report and the other is a summate report. Mhm. Er, therefore make a distinction between the two parts of the report, You mean rather then the , the report? No, I think Mm mm. Ah! We a we no we agreed, we agreed a on a fi We need to shift to to the procedure that we would probably have and a tell me if I'm wrong I thought there was a sort of general agreement without it being sort of firmly agreed that we were going to go for a format of subject specific reports still coming to form tutor who would complete some sort of general report, is that Yes. not what we had in mind? And that general report would be in a sense a summate report or a form tutor report or a er, pupil management report, whatever title Mm. it is we're gonna Mm. use. Mm. So is is that the context of the word report Andrew, er, that you're using. Well my feeling was that we had agreed that the parents would sent the subject reports Yeah. where they never have been sent before Yes. as well as the summate report. Oh yes! Yes , yes they would go as well I'm not Yeah saying alright, yes that would go as well! Well I think that's certainly And on that basis I'm not sure we need subject report in just a report and subject in the box. Perfect , perfectly logical that! Yeah? Mm. But as a necessary But we would still have a form tutor input i.e. a summation Yeah , but some chance for the youngster in a but yo with records of achievement i.e. But do you agree that that everybody in each subject should fill in that? Something like that. Oh well wait till you get round to that, we sti Really? Yes, oh yes, I think that should I mean, it's a , it's the be summarised in the form of some sort of Giving what we're being asked to do we do need to have something that focus on general skills and abilities, we've gotta decide what they are. Mm. But, yes, I agree we need something like that. But the big problem at present is that that form tutors get loads of information sent to them and then they have to summarise it, and an awful lot of what has been done by the subjects It's wasted, It's just wasted the form teacher! Right, if this is going on just keep it! we said the last time, did we not? That if this is going home then that sort of thing doesn't need to come from a form tutor, other than a sa er a sort of generalised one as well, if you like. Aye, it's the form tutor one needn't Mm. needn't be, I mean once they've got all of this the form tutor one needn't be anything . The form tutor can well can build in a lot of good practises that have been built in The the form I se over the years. I'm I'm I see the form tutor one as being now we've got hold of record of achievement as being part of the developmental process of a record of achievement, now our youngsters know what a personal statement is, form tutors are happier with a joint statement it's taken us four years Three or four three four years to get there but it strikes me that we can actually start moving towards that process, not a full sheet of a personal No. statement, but we can start moving towards a personal statement You can right the way across the school so we've actually got a standardised format and everybo everybody's involved in it all the way. And there's still no reason why in that sa er, joint statement that our subject reports No. to them needn't be a, er a starting point, a key for discussion between Absolutely! the child and the tutor. I mean you could have, if you have basically what we're saying is that you have a whole load of of subject reports and on the top of it you've got form tutor report Yes. which is basically er a summary of A positive comment, an overall positive comment based on all Su sa the other reports. summarising wha , the same sort of thing as they're gonna get in the fifth year of the That's right! to build up maybe you know, individual statement, joint statement perhaps on on the sheet But it allows Mm. in keeping with, it allows that opportunity as you know as a form tutor, somebody's been on a a a residential weekend Mm. to include the other things that we've done, so all I'm trying to say is, it's in keeping with the philosophy of records of achievement. That's right,, yes! Their, their, their out of school activities Yeah! anything like that. But but, you should also be be sure that the form tutor pro can clarify things for parents because although, no no matter how hard you try to make this erm, a clear and easily understandable document it's only clear and un easily understandable to us. Yes, but all form tutors are gonna have to become aware of each subject's Cos they're gonna be you know they're gonna be they are they're gonna be summarising them a all the They are. time That's right. and hopefully it's not gonna change! No, and it'll make it a lot easier for the form tha these are the same format Mm. So that they can do that quickly and easily Mhm. and make it easier for the parent to understand whether this is good or bad. Ah yes, it's just gotta the Well I don't think, they don't that choose but sometimes that change. parents have come to me and said so and so's only got a C, it's appalling! I think , I think that's very well laid out, I think that's quite self explanatory to Er, for us it is, yes but I think I think it's Oh yeah! reasonably clear for parents actually. I I think one of the other points Makes sense. Quite a lot of parents. Quite a lot of parents. Yeah, okay. One of the other points about it is that it will erm er, in in the minds of the parents the they will see this one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten er being used, poor, satisfactory, excellent and it will get them into the idea of what these levels Mm. are. Yes. And they will therefore be able providing it's it's used in that format Oh yeah. it will be able to interpret for them what these numbers mean in the middle bit. Mm. Mhm. Don, do you envisage the er the general skills and abilities being done by pupils or pupils and staff together or I thought, I I well, I don't envisage anything but I mean I would of thought that kids could fill it in in pencil and then we do the same as we did before a and and that the staff in some way put in their own. Mhm. Ca can we just look at a I don't know which way to to be specific or to look at the general first, can I just a make some general comments about the, I mean I like that we talked about that before, I like the ten levels Yes. I think we need to bla , talk about what the general skills and abilities are. Mm. I wonder about the pupil comment being divorced from the staff comment I wondered whether they one should follow the other. I would rather not have that on the subject reports but if it's going to be on i for the sake of coherence the comments should be together. Mm you see I I it's it's trying to find the balance isn't it? I I'm er ah I like to think that the youngsters have actually got some input into the report, I think it's important Yes, I'm not saying deny that but at the same time I would want to afford er, you as heads of departments er er everybody's heads of department a little bit of leeway what i what if, what wa wa we have to be careful about this that we set a standard but allow a little leeway because all departments are slightly different and want to approach things Mm. slightly differently and what I'm trying to say is I don't want the leeway to weaken the strength of the reporting do you know what I mean? Yeah. Mm. And if you don't feel that you can fit in a pupil comment, you have to be very careful here because some people will take it as a cop-out and not do it and a that worries me and it has happened and I think it is important that the youngsters are actually given some guidance and the opportunity to do it. You're Yes. saying you're not in a position to do that in the moment or you wouldn't want No. to do that? No, I'm not saying that, I've Have I got the wrong end of the stick? I'm not saying it like that, what I'm saying is I would pref , yes, I would like them to be involved in it a as far as my subject reports are concerned I would like our reports that we do, we do involve the kids, I pass them out, we discuss them and I'll re-draft but I would not, rather not have their written sample on that piece. Okay. I think they get fed up and I don't think that a that language-wise they have the vocabulary in the school to be able to pluck out meaningful comments and you know, and go right across the curriculum there I think dif let me finish! Mm. Er, it's difficult for them. Erm, I think you should involve them but I think it'll be preferable if it was one to one with the form tutor i that time and the form tutor has taking an over-view Mhm. and they were taking over-view as well right? Now that's what I'd prefer, but in every, you know the majority go against me and they want it in a as I say I I would, I think that it'd be better placed at the top. Guidance? I prefer the pu pupil comment to be honest. You would like the pupils to to make their own written comment in there? I'd also like the national curriculum levels to come straight underneath course one. Yes. You see I felt Can we no ,ca Yes, comments together. can we just come back to the pupil comment business, one thing at a time for a moment and can we try and get how people feel the reason about whether they want a pupil comment in. The reason I'd put pu pupil comment where it is, is because so far as I was concerned the top half of that I was gonna, was gonna be filled in by staff it is a report. Mm. That's the top part the bottom part is open to negotiation and that's why I've put them altogether at the bottom. Well Mhm. Don the staff comment one could come under the national curriculum levels if you Yeah, you mean out Yes. outline then that Yeah. bit then staff comment? Yes. Can I come back to my original question, which was yo Pupil comments. you you want pupil comment Yes or no? Paul? Andrew, your thoughts? Yes, if we didn't have pupil comment we would miss some absolute pearls like Mr is a lying git! And, you know only I couldn't live without that! What was that word? Git! You've convinced me Andrew! Was that Is that Bet he then! is that, but you Has it? but you do have to remember as I say I've got one I'll give you my book later on Angela! you do have to remember at the same time that these documents would be going home and Aha. there is a a a level of er oh Propriety? yes that when you An appropriateness! yes, that and we need to follow. Oh. I would hope that if, if a parent saw er that er somebody had had that sort of attitude towards the staff that Mm. the parent would have the opportunity of making an appropriate Mm. It's not only that but if if if No, it's not only that if they if they did this i would it not give them practise at at being able to do the Mm. you know, the the report at the end of of, of five years? You know Angela's expressed a view. I'm I'm saying the but not just stage that's what all Chaps! Oh, er erm Alan, sorry? Erm I'm half and half I I I go along with Angela in the main that the the kids in, generally speaking the kids that I've talked to don't want to put their own input a lot of them don't want to because, as Angela says, they cannot find the appropriate words and some of the others just write some some stuff that I would look at and say I'm, you know I'm not very happy having that written on this. I've had But it's science this year. But with all due respect is some of that not to do with the guidance their receiving from us as teachers? Certainly, I I've told you Absolutely! I have spent But a great deal of effort and time in enabling the children to write something meaningful I I've let it in Sure you know im im improve their English language. Sure. Okay, Paul? Surely we've working from er statement banks for pupils for quite a long time and why Can we can't we, why can't we be picking out guiding, guidance as far everything Alright, I should be I don't have to look, if I can just It's all mechanistic to say that! I don't have to look It's all what? Mechanistic you know mechanistic Oh yes I feel oh stop ! I don't have to look too far back in there when we started this whole process, four or five years of throwing it all up in the air to say that I felt every pupil could comment in some way, something that they had enjoyed, something they felt they'd been successful at, something they felt they found difficult, something that had pleased them, surely every child could comment on wo , if it's just one of those things Wha but i it has then And that's on every subject, that's the what Angela's, the point No. Angela's making Yes I think it it be it becomes repetitive They they get a Yeah. bit sick of this Yeah. you know! Yo your It becomes stale, they say I like this it was good! Yes, I I I I And things like that. But is that not part of our job to get them to think and ? Yes, absolutely, I agree with you! Obviously I agree with you that we should be putting the kids in challenging situations where that they've gotta rise to the occasion and use language in an effective way, but I don't know whether this is the best way, these er er er, you know, a series of how much space of you got? Whereas, if they were involved in the end where they sat with the form teacher Mhm. read the lot, I mean, look what they doing language-wise, they're reading, they're evaluating, they're projecting I mean,the that, they're doing quite complicated things there, and also hopefully there will be enough space where they have the opportunity to put something that is meaningful and they're involved in the dialogue with the form Right. teacher. Paul? I I, for pupil comment you could ea , quite easily have a joint statement there, or a joint comment whereby the Or just statement. there's no Or just real reason why comments. once a year that er a subject teacher and a pupil cannot sit down an and come up with a Could I take sometime. Could we get round with that? Could we get round that by, instead of saying staff comment and pupil comment make the space Join them. slightly larger and just say Just say statement? Just say comment actually. Comment. Comments. Mm. Comments. That's what But I have to put back to you that the onus then falls on you and head's of departments to ensure that that space is used properly. Oh it will be. Okay. Yes,that will. And I have to say my experience it leaves me to doubt, I know I'm a cynic sometimes, that the space will not be used effectively and Well because people get under pressure and it's oh Christ I ain't got time so I won't bother! I'm sorry Well that's if that's very cynical and I know it's unfair in some context. It is Mm. unfair! Erm, I think that is unfair We Rod, yes I agree with Don, I think if you look at er what the work has gone in er in the fifth year for the last two or three years and the way that subject teachers are now approaching ranks of achievement I don't see yes it's . It's not a process wi , that's not a valid comparison in the sense that in No? fifth, in fifth year and year eleven it's a different ball game altogether. But why shouldn't staff put the same process into operation lower down the school? I think beca I think because some don't actually transfer the skill, if I might, say that. Yes but I mean, in some cases I've gotta say in some cases it is inappropriate to make a lot of comments with Mhm. a lot of pupils you are giving a lot of information Mm. here and here on the pupil Mm. in some cases it may be appropriate but if you're forcing people to make comments just because there's a space to do it Mm. then it loses a lot of it's values, yes. Right. But can't we think about re-phrasing that so we get this idea of this joint statement, some sort of dialogue on Okay. on there. Co , more comments then? Right. I think that's a point to pick up on actually. Mm, I Andrew? On this? I'm never never one for for making work but on an a on although this isn't going to be called an annual report for most children it will be an annual event and I do feel quite strongly that for the child to be able to have the opportunity Mhm. of doing this and the opportunity is one where they are told to do and they will not miss the opportunity. Well they're gonna Is be told to do that when they're doing this bit aren't they? Mm. When they're going to look Mm. at this bit and tick these boxes Yes, but ticky boxes, and expressing themselves in other Yeah but ways the ways perhaps that are not Sticky! erm you know the, what they wish to express is not available on the Mm. ticky boxes erm That sho sho should be there. I know that our children by enlarge er their vocabulary doesn't extend to erm what er, polysyllabic words which which might really sum up for an adult what they've been going through, how they've enjoyed it but what is the terrible form we had last year in seventh year, was it seven G ? Yeah. Erm, George and I had that class shared between us, he took them for an hour a week and I did and i if there is a class that any of us had ever taken that would be unlikely to be able to write something meaningful of this kind Mhm. that would be the class and yet they all did cos George and I insisted! But we helped them by suggesting Mm. words and er, they didn't lose it they, they they they went along with it and they, they actually, some came Yeah. up with some quite good descriptive language with some aesthetic terminology which we guided them with, but we didn't put the words in their mouths Mm. each one came out as a very personalised and individualistic comment which reflected that child. Mm. Some of them very negative, and how much they hated doing what they'd been made to do er, and others very surprisingly made it known that they had thoroughly enjoyed it. Erm, but the , they were totally honest they didn't feel Mm. made to do anything else. But I would not have known that children who said they enjoyed it, were enjoying it Mm. cos they behaved so badly! Mm. And I hadn't enjoyed it ! Maybe that's why they enjoyed it Andrew? Mm. Perhaps it was , in fact, one or two of them said, you know we like ripping the piss out of Mr ! I think you've also gotta look at it from the kid's point of view and perhaps I'm wrong here but, you know when you think, I mean,the these are going to be done very, you know er i i we got a sort of time limit, and kids are going to be told during perhaps a two week period Mm. right, science, right come on then let's get down to this! Then they'll now go into a maths lesson let's go into this, they're gonna perhaps do that eight times, then they're gonna get a breather, then a few days time after that the form teacher's saying right, let's do it again and summarise it, I think it's too much! Right, well I I part of me says,the the there are two aspects, the other side of the coin a little bit, if we talk about recording achievement and not recording failure, we here have an opportunity to point out to youngsters, encourage youngsters in that they are all capable of achieving in some way and to get them to write down that they have achieved, that's the other side of the coin. I know it happens in individual subjects and there's the element of repetition but, you are at the same time making them reflect over a certain period and say I have not entirely wasted my time, there maybe some youngsters for whom it will be extremely difficult, and I except that but my thinking is that is you look hard enough you can find something that everybody has done at whatever level that they can take some pride in. Aha, and they can do that in the summary! I agree with you but they can achieve that in a different form, if that's your purpose it doesn't need to be achieved like this. Yes. There is no reason why, why the teacher and the pupil shouldn't be discussing this bit of it! You're going to give them more of a ri , a more of a resource bank, if you like, right to pu pluck these, er these comments from How will we class if they take an if over view. Right, if we don't do it that way how will we pass that information, which a a as I understand it you want passed to the form tutor? Well it's go , it's all going to be there in the reports and surely the kids are going to able to form everything . No it won't be on if if we use this as the document reports. for science No I don't mm, yeah. we're immediately saying now, well we need another sheet of paper because the information No! that we're talking about No do that, right? That's the only thing that's gonna be off, okay? And then we as the form teacher sits why can't the kids look at the reports as well? But will the form teacher be able to do as you would do in English and say, but look when you did that written piece on so and so it was goo, the form teacher will not have that detailed knowledge that you will have We'll give the kids some prompts you know, what have you enjoyed? What have bla bla bla Angela I would have thought er and involve that in part of the programme, you know, where they're, where they're involved in the whole report and assessment. For for si for the six subjects? Angela Form teacher wouldn't have time to do that! No, no you do I'm not making myself clear! That's why it should be done in the No. No, what I'm suggesting is lesson. that the kids erm as an alternative, the kids could get some help on how to, look at all the reports and extract a couple of positive statements that's what the emphasis should be, not that he's a git! Right? No nothing on that, that sort of line but you I think you're taking one example there actually Angela! I think you're interrupting A me! A , take a couple Yes, I am. positive statements right and they need a little bit of help on how to do that and then make some sort of generalised positive comment about themselves, that's what I mean. Mm. So Or , or if that, if you disagree with that well, put pupil comment there, hyphen or whatever upon but lead that on, give them a bit of a leader into it. Mhm. Can I summarise? Go on then. We're getting nowhere fast Well I ca I mean can we I think we are! could I, could I make a suggestion? No, that's important. Could I make a suggestion? Taking into account everything everybody said the formats as it is, course outline after course outline goes your individual bit, right? Subject, but national curriculum levels on this one Yeah. sta sta staff comment comes out of there and that bit goes up then you have general skills and abilities and then below that you have a wider box which just says comments which will include a staff comment and may include a pupil comment as well cos because it's signed by both at the bottom. Can I just check what you were saying there? So, take the staff comment from there and instead of putting staff down put a generalised comment on this? Just put instead of having staff comment and pupil comment, you got one box, comment. Double the size of the box Comments. down there. Comments. So that That would that comes out instead of being there Can I have a word please? Mm mm. It's down there. Paul? I'd like, I think as it is at the moment is erm is superb! And I think, instead of pupil comment it should be some sort of joint say. But I think that's perfectly adequate. And I think kids should be encouraged to erm think about themselves rather than just tick boxes and I think er, er er a group of sentences down here written by the form teacher, by the subject teacher and the pupil erm, as it's been done for about, for a few years, a good habit to get the kids into, erm especially as a record of achievement should start from year seven. Mm. Can I just ask then, if you're saying to be it should be a joint statement, but you Mm. think that format's alright, is that not a contradiction because if it's a joint statement and this format's alright you've got staff comment divorced from pupil comment? I want the staff comment and I want the, a joint statement at the at the bottom. But I want your opinion, I mean the sa , the the staff comment is going to be Well you do exactly repetition! you do exactly the same on the erm on the record of achievement don't you? You've got a a staff comment and then you have er a pupil comment which is really Well written in as a No. joint sort of No no you have a pupil statement personal in the statement. in the sa in the form, in the form when the form teacher does it. You have a personal statement then the joint statement. You don't have a staff comment and a joint statement. But the staff comment is in the statement I , in the subject specific. Mm. Right. So you wo you would like to have it in a format similar to the the very final Yes. thing that they're aiming at so Yeah. they get used to the format? Mm. That's sounds very reasonable but I I er I I ha not having been at the level, form tutor Mm. but er you know Yeah, I think for some years, I've never done one of those. I take what Paul's saying, I think I'm not really with it. I think there's a scale element cos we're talking one sheet here and it's a it's a much bigger exercise. Okay right. But I I I agree what you're saying, it's very valid. Guidance then Paul? Can , yeah, can we can we vote on whether we're going to improve pupil comment? And then when that's decided let's decide Well let's upon the format. get dead clear about what it is we're go actually gonna vote on Right. because it's we've gone a bi On the a bit round the houses. Either in principle Am I right in saying then i i is the first thing we need to agree on whether we're gonna have a staff comment, and a pupil comment on there is tha , is that the first decision? I think everybody's in agreement about staff aren't they? There's no question about staff comment on there? No. Right, fine! Right. Er , what do you mean there's no question? Everybody accepts there should be a staff comment on. Er, okay and it's sold! Fair enough, well, that's the point I was making. The the the in order to get by pupils writing these er rather immature things that they write on the Mm. bottom of these reports why can't you make it into a a pu er er a a joint teacher pupil comment, it isn't just a, it isn't in the same form it's just the same that the pupil writes that with guidance with teacher guidance, sitting next to the teacher. I think we're losing track of what this actually is Paul, there are, you're trying to do two things at once what you're trying to do, I think is use it as a learning process for children but this is an annual report for parents and I think that part of it a at least surely must be a report by the sa member of staff, by the department on how the child has done, by the member staff. By all means give the, give the kid a chance to, to put his side of the story if you like, but there must be er Well we've got all that there haven't we? Right. Yep. Yeah? I know. The the form that we have currently the er sta statements are they called at the moment? Yeah. Erm, I know that the way that I do it every time it looks rather like a is what we use? Is that the one you want as a form tutor? Er, it's subject Oh. Then I haven't got a front have I? That Er one? Yes, it is there. Yeah. Er, the comment here the way that I have been used to doing these I found that I I like it and the kids can You write yours and they write theirs? I I invariably do write something Mm. So do I. and the kid invariably writes something down. Well that's what I suggested ten minutes ago! And I like that form. Yes. Whilst you've suggested everybody else has a right to their opinion and doesn't make yours the solution! And I think having, as a separate issue, the staff comment as a ! a separate box er, you know, er is is is not necessarily appropriate. Sometimes, if the child writes in there first I say, I concur with what so and so has said, Well done or something like that. Would Sometimes the child isn't really very good at writing and I will write something encouraging and the kid says I have liked my art well, yeah Can I, can I that's all they can do can I then put to you in fairness. I think, what Don's saying is It's got differentiation though. that we have a comment area Testing, testing, testing ! that we have a, differentiation he said,differenti Differentiation. we have a Differentiation. comment area when we, these go out there would be guidance which would say their staff must make their comment in that space Yeah. how the other part of space is used could be left to individual departments on the basis that Of discretion. discretion or it is hoped that pupils would be afforded the opportunity to make their own, if Involved in the process. you wish so, they must certainly be involved in the process Yes. or it could be an agreed joint statement and written by the member of staff. Whichever way you are. Oh yeah. So it allows So what does that mean? What you're saying is basic comment yo you're gonna put comment? We will put No then comment call that statement then. It's gotta have something before it though. It's qui , comments! Well Comments by who? Well Comments and statement? Well, if you put comments and Mm. a me a member of staff writes the comment and signs it it's obvious who has written the comment, i.e. the member of staff has written it, you could then have something underneath if you wish to, that is the pupil's, that will be obviously the pupil's from the different writing, or the style of the writing er or you could open it up with we have agreed, if you wish to one make it a joint Aha. statement. Aha. And we would put that down as basic guidance to staff when completing reports. Yes. Yes, yeah. In other words it leaves the format open to the department concerned? Let the cat in Alan But would you and I'll get the food, I'm a bloody expert cats and that's, sorry, and they acted immediately there. ! Terry, thoughts? I mean, we've not sort of included you No I've I mean, I know that in the primary schools nowadays they do allow, or do let the ki the children actually write their own reports as well. Mm. Cos they're actually coming up from this year Mm. I mean, they It's the records of achievement. so they're doing it from the age of possibly eight or nine some people, certainly down right the way through Mm. the bottom of the school. I've But I , I I still agree with It's young to be doing it. what somebody said that the, sometimes the pupil's comments are kind of as Andrew pointed out earlier that er Yes. It's not the sort of things that but you wanna see on a on a Yeah. on a report, on a But I mean but with guidance Yeah, yeah You see I That's right! I agree with what you're saying but when I've done it before and involved the pupil in such a report I put it on a separate sheet, so that Yes there's been Yeah well that's what the primary school's done. ma , this is prior to all this you see Yes. Yes. and we had all this we've got Ha I have to go along here some, to some of you with a bossy statement of you know, this inclusive as opposed Yeah. to exclusive bit Mm. Mm. and it allows the opportuni it affords the opportunity to be inclusive and I think that's important. Well a po what about the reverse? Sorry? Put it on the reverse of the sheet. We then get into all sorts of photocopying production problems, I mean this is why I was asking did you want another piece of paper? I know it's a bit penny-pinching Mm. Oh! but erm, because Mm. that's very But Rod, I I sti I think it is also is good preparation for year eleven. Mm. Oh yes! that's a they should be thinking about it right from the word go. Oh absolutely! Yeah. Absolutely! As long it is joint, I mean there's no way that yo that you could have something sent home to parents Right, with a kid's comment, maths is crap! You know , yeah You know you would tear it up wouldn't you? Ye well I would, yes. Yes! But so and lo , on the other hand though I'd But I I go on sorry Paul a lot of the the statements these kids make are quite reasonable, well written comments Yes! Mm. so wha what Andy's done, and what other people have done have pitted, picked out a few great examples, but I would say that erm the majority are quite reasonable comments, if, if perhaps a little bit simple at times, I don't know. Does seem . Andrew? I would , I would tend to say the majority aren't, aren't interested in their, in their own comments. Erm, well But that depe , a lot of, sorry Rod! A lot of that depends on on the, on the staff input Mhm. Mhm. and how they motivate In school the kids, as Andrew has pointed out that, as as he and George operate. Last comment from Andrew and then we move on cos we've got a a an agreement in in what we're gonna put in, we haven't got an agreement as to where we're gonna put it but Andrew comment? Well I'm prepared to say th th that I that I think that we do do good practice in that we do sit down with the children and help them, each individual along with the with our joint statements. Never the less, it is the child speaking we don't put the words into their mouths and as such when they speak and when they write it down, it's one of the, possibly one of the few chances of having primary evidence of how the child is at er, writing er, on an official document Mm. er, progressing through the years I doubt whether samples of the child's work are kept officially in any other form or anywhere else They are. their handwriting and so on. They are. Maybe they are in English but Mm. but not an official document as opposed to a subject, I mean, I keep all their pictures, you know that Mm. they do. But it's a central a central Mm. easily accessible Yeah, that's fair enough. by anybody form so, here we have each year, six examples of the child's writing and thought processes and opinions at least, well I, I said six because I ca don't really know how many subjects a child will be taking or writing for Mm. but it is primary evidence and I think as primary evidence it has an extra value to the child's records, and to the school's records, over and beyond what Mm. we have ever had or thought about, practically. On the other hand each time they get a report they're going to have ten pieces or their work on each report Right! which I'd never have thought. Tha , that is what,i isn't that what I just said? Yeah. Mm. And then they're gonna have an eleventh one when they, when they do it with the form tutor. The form tutor and . Are they going to do with the form teacher Yes, once a year. tutor as well? Mm. Well once a year but they never Yeah. have to be a little parcel won't it? Because we need to go through that An example summation joint statement process. Can we run through this again then so we Right. can decide? Let's come back to it then, so we've agreed a basic heading, although we need to play with that a bit, name, year tick indicates end of end of key stage Ooh mm! No, I'm not too sure about that! We well Yeah ,tha that that's just Let's just leave it for the moment , let's just leave it for the moment. Course outline I think we're all agreed, should be at the top er, that is important we've now agreed a heading and comment we've got a e enough agreement that says that, it will be just called comment, but guidelines will need to be produced to go to staff erm Rod, is that national curriculum levels or is that staff comment after course outline just there? Well that's what I want to get from you now if I can. Oh sorry! Carry on. We've agreed comment, where would the comment be placed, given that, I think we all agree we want national curriculum area in, we need a general skills and abilities in, where would the comment be situated, at the bottom underneath everything, between the two or what? A at the end of the main staff input. Yes. So that should go there. So are you saying with the suggestion so as it sits now between national curriculum No, I'm asking you there but I'm asking you when's the me , end of the main staff input? That's there isn't it because that's Mm. supposed to be a joint activity there? Mhm. So I would suggest that it would go there. So I would Between national curriculum levels and general skills and abilities as it sits at the moment? Yes. Mhm. Course outline national curriculum levels, staff comment. Erm I would differ er, with that opinion because I would say that the comment as a joint comment would erm have to deal with the general skills and abilities Mm , oh yeah. which the child er erm, generally speaking does with, they're getting teacher guidance. So, the comment, joint statement Which refers to what? Will be about everything, not just the top bit but would include comment of the whole for that. Right, I I'm sorry I didn't understand I thought that you That's okay. that was gonna be a se separate No. staff No. if it's a joint comment, yes it should go at the end. So com wi th but we've agreed, I'm sorry if I'm being repetitive and boring and the rest of it but comment, there would be a staff comment, how you use the rest of the space, assume there's a double space is now left with you given the guidelines are issued. Well we're gonna say staff comment are we? Are we? No, it would just be comments. yes Yeah. And the first part of it that would be staff comments. The first part of it must be a staff comment. Right. And And it will be double the size Well it won't be double the it'll be size it'll be it'll be staff Yes. comment plus, pupil comment Will it ? so it'll be like Yeah. that. we will just put it as a space. one big block. So it'll be left up to the A space with individual That's right. It'll be as a space. Okay. So And is this, are are the I know this again just minor, but if the staff produces a comment are they going to sign that and also sign the bottom or are we just gonna leave it that the parent will be able say I think it's pretty obvious who's written what. That's what I'm saying! Well is it? I say,Ro Ro Rod, there's gonna be Yeah. sorry, there's gonna be some people who don't even ha have no pupil comment on at all then? They have no pupil input? Course they will! It will have Well no pupil input on that bit. There's gotta be a pupil input, there's no way you can do this Why, why do you say that? I'm just er interested, that's all. So the No,the they'll be a pupil input, it might well be that as a department there's a decision that the pupil would not write Yeah. on the report. Right, okay. But it does, you are not precluded from allowing a youngster to write on a report. I'm I'm er er being a little naughty and trying to steer a middle road, if you like In other words it could be correct me if I'm wrong I, what I don't, if Andrew obviously feels he's got a strong process that suits him and I don't want to knock that on the head. Alan, I'm sorry if I'm sort of trying to put you at the end and continue and I I don't intend it like that. I don't mind, I just know Alan exactly where I stand on this! Well Alan sort of has a feeling that he doesn't want that to happen and I want to fi , I, what I don't like, I I mean I go , personally I go with Andrew's feeling but I don't want, so I don't want to exclude that again Mm. I want, I want if I want to do both. to afford the opportunity I at the same time, there are people who sit in the middle ground Mm. and I think it's perhaps important to start with that we go with something that's a little bit open-ended that we can review in a years time er, perhaps a little bit later and say well look we have shown that we can do it valuably er the proof is in the pudding, it now beholds everybody to do it this way. Yes. Is is that, is that reasonable? Yeah? Agreed. Yeah. Right? Grand! Er, well I I don't want you to feel that that er maths department No, I'm not saying don't want no. pupils involved because every piece of work that a kid does is discussed with the pupil the only thing that I was a little wary about was a pupil actually putting down Mr is Right. a so and so, er maths is crap and so on and you know, that's that's going to make this into something that we wouldn't want Right, I I I'm I'm anyone to go, you know to see. I do apo I wasn't trying to put you as the bad boy on that end of the continual, I wasn't Alan, I'm No. We could be here for about He's a bad boy ! So, so we're saying that there will be a staff comment, then there maybe nothing else or there maybe a pupil comment or there maybe a joint statement? Mm. That's right. That's right. So that's every system incorporated. Staff comment followed by one It's very vague though innit? No. Well it's not! So we'll leave it and down three formats possible. mm. And that's going at the bottom we're saying there right? Mhm. Right at the bottom? Yep. Yeah. So that bit that goes there and that bit goes rou , put that back in again that's right Yeah. bottom, it's gonna be called comment? Mhm. Mhm. Are you gonna issue guidelines or just leave it? Yep. No, there will be guidelines and you're in the know anyway so you'd be telling at your curriculum area meetings, you'd be saying Cascade as opposed to Cascade Ca , oh! But you're not going to Ca cascading! Cascade! Cascade! But you're not going You're no , not the sweat pouring off my brow! No, but you're not going to you're just gonna leave it open? Yeah, for the reasons that I've said to You're going to we can evaluate it later on a Okay. without you know, having to Well it's not that open because we're saying there must be some staff something written by staff Yeah. or are we not? Oh yes we are aren't we? Yes. Staff have to write their comments Ah Something there is then an option after that and involve the child. as to whether it's a joint and involve them they must be involved mustn't they? I I'm sorry I just take that as automatic, I don't even think about it any more. I think you should write that down okay, that means pupils Well must be involved in in some form I I do and I don't that's your job is, can I be naughty, it's your job as cacs to insist that that's happening. So you would advise, Rod that, you would I I, no it's go er er youngsters are involved in it, I mean that's just my assumption, it's our rationale, well it at the moment. I don't know where the rationale is but it's written I'm that's it's everybody's responsibility. Point the finger Paul, come on! Yes. I'm not into that Angela, I couldn't do that! I can't honestly Why? They they are meant to do it and don't do it, they should be told to do it. Mm. By? Exactly! Mm. Yes, but there is still the the the thought that a me , I'm sorry ! A a a member of staff may feel that they want to say something about a kid, and it does not necessarily have to agree with what the kid Here here! That's right. You know, I mean, I might be saying Jimmy has wasted his time this year Oh yeah! then he will have under me have to say, Jimmy does not agree with this Yes. he feels, and so on, but there has got to be something that is obvious staff comment. Er Yes, absolutely! Well yes I, I put down comments like that and that is, that would be exactly the right way to do it! that the kids don't agree with You say Jimmy I think it's this the I sa I put my reasons forward because Jimmy could then sign that and they're, they're they're still involved aren't they? Aye? Disagreement's involvement Mhm. isn't it? Yeah, I'm I mean the number of times, Alan, I've read quite a few Got your facts right! I've come across we agree er, or Jimmy feels now once somebody writes Jimmy feels it's, it's almost intrinsic that, is that the word I want? That, there is da , yeah it's a word, there is disagreement. I might be to you but it's this is going to a parent! Yes. I I I'd agree with Alan, I'd Yeah, that's right. I don't see that that pu that the the staff comment, which is gonna be the first thing need have anything to do with the child at all there is ample place Oh if you think within Shoot that man! Jesus Christ! Well in the sense that they've been involved in it. No No but the I don't they need to be involved in it whatsoever! They've read what you've said and then say well I don't agree with that and you can write down that. Absolutely! A staff comment is But surely that is involvement, I'm not understanding what you're putting forward! No I think No. it's the way the words have been used that we're interpreting wrong. If I've got to write a comment for a start What sort of weasel word then? then I want to write a comment, I will not necessarily involve the child with No. what I'm writing he will Er then see that, or he will have Mm. already seen it because he will be involved in that bit. Aha. Yep. Mm. Well But if she does see it Well if she does see it, yes. Yes, yes, she! subtle ah? Alright. If she does see it and disagrees with it that's involvement isn't it? Mm. Yes. Mhm. We're agreed then. Okay Might not agree with this I I I think we've I think we've covered that. Right. I think we've flushed that one haven't we? Well I think so Well there you are! I mean I don't know how you It's hard work this isn't it? I need some tea ! Anyone need a cup of tea I I think on the ! It's only half past two! We've only been here three quarters of an hour ! Well we've got ten pages to do, we're only half way through the first page man ! No, we haven't , no we haven't we we're okay because that have been there for years haven't they? But it does need cleari , unless we get some sort of consensus, and it behove you to say look this is it's my belief but there are beliefs, I mean it does behove you to present Yes! what other departments feel to your to your people, because wha , you do have to be careful about the indoctrination, this is what I believe so it's right, we've gotta we do have to strike a balance. I mean I've got my own thoughts, I have to be careful here that you know I've got to try and pull together what you think because at the end of the day it's it's very important that it reflects the way we work in school, not the way I perceive I we work in in school because you're the people at the chalk first. I think a , that there's another point that we should all remember and that is that it shouldn't just be our opinion either, we are sort of told from high certain things By who? that we have to do in a certain way, in a certain format and certain things have got to be included and we've got to take that in hand as well. But we've done that in the brief that we've we've worked on. Yeah, Oh no, I know, I know, I know! We've already got past Yeah. that stage. Yeah, alright! Fair enough! I think haven't we? But after what she said Sorry , I'm being defensive, sorry! Mm. Right so we got staff comment, it will either be a pupil er, statement written by the member of staff or written by the pupil themselves or a joint statement, they were the three Or no on both. On all three. I it will be staff Did we alter it? Yeah. it could be staff alone, it could be staff and pupil, it could be staff and joint. Okay the only thing it can't be just But they're going to be no comment. See. Right, we will make, move progress. Thank you for that, er it's not, it's not easy ground and I do appreciate with which it's happening and the lack of sarcasm that is occurring. Ha! Ha! Ha! See this, this bit here this, the whole presentation this that they weren't convinced it was necessary to include such a sweeping up policy since there's a whole battery of other policies in the plan which were designed to protect erm the special parts of the countryside in the county. Now what we're hearing today in in the document that's been put in by the County is that their assertion is that since nineteen eighty the changing erm common agriculture policy has meant that more farm land in the county is coming into play for development than was the case in nineteen eighty erm not least of all through set aside and general policies of diversification. And that the county feels that there is a case for this sweeping up policy now in nineteen ninety three whereas in nineteen eighty the Panel had felt it to be inappropriate. So the main reason, that's just sorry it's a long way of getting to it sir but, the main change in circumstance that the county is putting forward since nineteen eighty compared with today is that agricultural policy means that more farmland is being diversified and they feel the need at county level to have a sweep-up policy to control that process. The other reason, there is only two reasons, the other reason the county gives for wanting this Policy E two now in nineteen ninety three erm is that the districts have all asked for it. A popular expression of demand from the district councils. Now I think what erm and my feelings on this er are very much er similar to Mr Donson's and I'm grateful for the calculation he has done for us all. But this particular county is extremely well covered by special forms of countryside protection both through national park, heritage coast, A O N B and as was mentioned in a rather a throwaway fashion but in terms of grade one, two and three A O N agricultural land. There really isn't much of the county that isn't covered already by those kinds of protections. And it seems to me perfectly understandable that the local planning authorities in the county would like to take one hundred percent control of the unbuilt upon part of the county. But the fact of the matter is that that isn't Government policy. It is not Government policy that all land everywhere should be subject to special constraint. Explicitly Government policy to the opposite. So it seemed to me, sir, that we need a very very special justification for this all embracing E two policy which brings me to the other thing to say about it as a general principle. Erm the questions you were asking just now were testing a possible implication that this policy is so weak in general, no no not weak, so general in its application that it really doesn't get in the way, it's testing that kind of hypothesis, and erm all I can say is from experience in North Yorkshire that, even without this policy since nineteen eighty, the county has been using its assertion of its need to protect the countryside generally as its policy position to stop things happening outside towns and villages and that with this policy in place we could see that a general position of the county maintained and then reinforced. And somebody has to say that under Section fifty four A if this kind of policy exists in the county structure plan it will be extremely difficult for any proposer erm of development outside built-up areas, existing built-up areas, to proceed. This is a genuine obstruction in this Policy E two of the most serious kind. And so in conclusion I looking at it and the exhibitions we've made to you and to the county in the course of the consultation draft is that this county does not need this policy and that it is in fact an insidious and repressive kind of policy that it contrary to national planning guidance and should not be included in the alterations. Can I pick up on that last point Professor Lock and throw out a question generally in response to what you and Mr Donson have said. What would be the effect on a Policy E two which said development in the a , applications for development in the open countryside would be determined in accordance with national policy set out in P P G seven. No not the last bit because there's there's bits of Government policy related to the countryside that isn't in P P G seven it's normally under P P Gs. I throw that into the arena on the basis that P P G seven exists it is not a policy in the terms of Section fifty four A unless it is made a policy in the terms of Section fifty four A. Nevertheless it is a material consideration in all applications be before the local authority or before the Secretary of State. If I could just say something, I know Mr I know you will sir, but erm just. That would work for those kinds of developments which P P G seven is addressing. Erm what would present problems in real life I think would be developments of a larger kind than that in which a new settlement er might be one strategic site if we had such a policy might be another. Erm and er P P G seven doesn't really give us a way through on that. I I was leaving the the sort of exceptions part of it and the game at the moment and asking, because I appreciate that you and Mr Donson for different reasons both want erm a policy that provides for exceptions. Can sticking with the sort of the general non-strategic development in the countryside, would such a policy work, would it be better than E two as proposed, would it be worse, would it be weaker? Er I will I will hand over but let me just say this that my instinct is that it a policy expressed in the way you've you've suggested is just superfluous because all you're doing is describing in in a po in upper case letters, the situation as it is and that that my answer is that it would that there would be no need for such a it would be gratuitously ap it's an unnecessary statement. Oh my reason for including it was Section fifty four A. To bring P P G seven and so on into the statutory plan Yes yes. and therefore make it enforceable. I I I mean I don't think you need to do that but er that's my response to your question. Roy Donson House Builders' Federation. I I I I think the erm situation that Miss Whittaker describes is the situation that we have today. What what what we have is a serious of local plans which include policies for protecting land and they are working perfectly well in achieving that objective. And the other material consideration or one of the other material considerations that comes into play for to determine particular applications is indeed Government guidance. So that's exactly the position that we have and there had been no proof as far as I can see to to demonstrate that in fact the present situation is not working. Patently the present situation is working and therefore that's part of it and what I would say is that that this additional policy if it isn't necessary because there there isn't any development pressure, then what is its purpose. I would submit its purpose is another piece of anti-development er strategy for for this particular county. I think there is there there is there is an issue that it isn't as simple as just where are we today and and and where are the boundaries of the settlement as Mr Williamson said. We've got to consider the situation of some form of flexibility and it presupposes that if you have a policy in which the settlements are drawn and I suppose I I think they will be tightly drawn, development yes is allocated in accordance with the structure plan. But that and then the rest of the land is is open countryside E two land. It presupposes that that is right that those boundaries have been rightly drawn essentially for all time. Or or certainly in the long term. And erm I think that that is a very dangerous situation to get ourselves in even in a county where the emphasis is on to protecting er er on environmental protection. I still feel it is a dangerous proposition to be in and we could end up in a situation where development comes to a full stop. Mr Heselton and then Mr Collier. Thank you sir. Terry Heselton Sel Selby District. Erm I think my answer to the to the questions being thrown out by by the Senior Inspector is is that surely Government policy is to protect the countryside for its own sake, and and why is it therefore wrong for a county with erm areas of acknowledged environmental importance to try and give expression to that in in its structure plan. Erm the the point I really wanted to make erm is response to to a comment from Mr Donson and and also Profe Professor Lock erm it it goes back to erm to my constraints map of the county, the one I submitted er as an appendix to my erm submissionary inspector of the H one issue, erm which rather unfortunately throughout the course of the examination has been er exploited by a number of other parties constr for their own purpose. But it it now gives me the opportunity to use it er for the purpose in which Have you charged a fee for that? Well yeah it has crossed my mind. But basically turning to the Selby situation erm I mean here here we have a district that doesn't have any areas of acknowledged national or landscape im importance at all but as as I mentioned previously that's not to say that there aren't valuable areas of countryside within the district and areas which to use use the words of of P P G advice are valued by the people that live and and work in the district and and also by visitors. Erm at various times throughout the course of the enquiry Selby seems to be gathering a bit of a growing reputation that that the district have let it rip or or the or the collecting point for the remainder of the county. And and I think that's why this particular policy is very important to the Selby district because it allows us to address the balance between meeting what I would call the justifiable development but also the equally important environmental consideration. Thank you. Mr Collier. David Collier National Farmers' Union. It seems to to me that erm Policy E two does not add erm much if anything to to Government policy which after all is fairly comprehensive in its dealings with development in the countryside. Not only in P P G seven but as has been pointed out in other erm guidance notes such as four erm and three. Perhaps the er chief of a Policy E two in an acceptable form is that it would give a clear signal to the district that it would not be appropriate to have a policy on rural diversification or in in development in the countryside more generally, which is stricter than Government guidance. And and so we certainly don't have strong views either way as to the need for the policy in principle but I can certainly see an advantage in having a policy in the right terms. It seems to me that E two as it is currently drafted is a great deal less comprehensive than P P G seven and a great deal more restrictive, possibly as a consequence of being less comprehensive. And I I thought I'd put to Mr Donson and Mr Loc Professor Lock to the district councils. Mr Earle. Thank you Chairman. Erm first of all if I may just er point out that the example I put with my paper that I have submitted today, and I thank you for the er indulgence in allowing me to produce it so late, was simply that there was one particular appeal of decision where an inspector remarked particularly on the lack of a local or a development plan policy relating to generally relating to the countryside. In other words it wasn't the one and only example where we felt this gap but it's simple one where remarked on it. If I may just refer you sir to er my appendix which it actually the last page of your papers erm er if you see on it is actually page numbered thirty one and it's paragraph thirteen thirty six at the very back of the papers. Erm and the inspector simply pointed there that the county er the council has quoted no approved policies to protect the countryside for its own sake. Well the plain fact of the matter was Chairman there were there were none to quote to him and erm we see the the structure plan Policy E two er as fulfilling a bridging role between national policy and the more specific guidance which would necessarily be contained in local plans. The county at first stage did try of course to produce some exceptions and and I think all the districts found ones they liked and ones they didn't like and I think quite reasonably the county said well er possibly the role of E two is simply to produce this broad policy goal and er this will er and as Richmondshire see it it'll be er for us to refine it as we see fit at district level. And I have pointed out in my papers that you must bear in mind perhaps that er quite a number of Rich er quite a number of the districts in North Yorkshire are of county scale in their sheer size and that therefore it is not inappropriate that at that level that the policies would be refined. Mr Sedgewick. Sedgewick Michael Courcier and Partners. We've approached this from a a slightly different angle and recognized that local planning experience within the county now and in the forthcoming district plans shows that there are going to be policies that restrict development in the open country. Therefore my clients would much rather deal with this at a strategic level than in individual district plans. But to do that we need to be sure that the policy is appropriate, does reflect national policy. As it stands the districts seem to be wanting their cake and eat it in that they would like er a policy restricting development in the open countryside but they don't want it to come with baggage that is specific which says what the exceptions should be. I don't think that that is the right way forward. If we are going to have Policy E two then it does need to be very clear as to the direction that the the strategic direction that the districts need to take with regard open land and that is the the subject of the the other questions that you've put before us. Thank you. Can I Sorry. come back to Mr Searle Mr Earle. Earle I beg your pardon, and I hesitate to raise any appeal decision. However, if I can use this example. It doesn't seem to me from what I read of page thirty one of that inspector's report that he was in any different position by the absence of the Policy E two than he would be if he'd got it. Yes I it's a it's I've contemplated because at the end of the day any appeal decision was er one in favour of the council's position. Erm and I have to er pick up the point made opposite that the protection has been pretty good over the last few years without the policy. That it is simply being this is why we feel that the role of the structure policies is to provide that er into local plan policies. But there is nothing anywhere in the P P G twelve in particular which says that before a district can have policy in their local plan there must be a lead policy in the structure plan. Is there? No. And within a couple of years districts will have district wide local plan coverage we hope. The er the county council came forward with these policies as a result of comments that er districts made a number of years ago and perhaps er over a passage of time erm makes at least validity your point but I I remain of the the view that there is in the there is nothing in the county structure plan that sets out the basic objective of protecting the countryside and still feel that's a valid objective within the structure plan erm within the structure plan er context. I notice Mr Allenby is nodding his head. Yes Chairman. David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council. Erm really just to reinforce that point. Erm Mr Donson was quite right that in the absence of erm structure plan policies er the districts have moved forward and prepared their own countryside protection policies er and these have been effective to a a greater or lesser degree. However I think in my view anyway this doesn't negate the point that the protection of the countryside is a strategic issue and should properly be covered in the structure plan. Erm there is then a case for that policy to be covered in the structure plan and of course in local plans and at the local plan stage there is an opportunity for councils to er interpret the structure plan policy to add er exceptions if they so wish and for those to be tested at a local plan enquiry. Mr Donson. Roy Donson House Builders' Federation. We've erm we've had quotes from from from Government policies from P P G seven's been mentioned twice quoting paragraph two point one protection er that the countryside should be safeguarded for its own sake and I know that there is a tendency to quote Government policy to back your own case. But erm it it it would seem to me that erm that the the basis of Government policy in writing to the countryside is para one ten of P P G seven, that talks about a balance essentially. And I also rely on my evidence of of quoting another custodian of Government policy namely the Prime Minister and its current Prime Minister erm who makes the point that proposals for development must not be turned down simply because it is the safest course. But also more importantly within that says that these, The siting of development is essentially something to be decided locally. And I think that that is very important. And that seems to me to go against having a strategic policy but what we're talking about is the interface at a local level between development and and protecting the countryside and that's quite rightly where the decisions should be made. It is not appropriate that we have a blanket policy at the strategic level and the need for this particular policy it would seem to me is unproven. Can I, Mr Donson and I are in danger of getting into a game of seeing who can next pick the most relevant bit out of a P P G. Yes. Nevertheless I shall continue. P P G twelve? P P G twelve paragraph five fifty three, reactions from the county and district councils please as to how Policy E two satisfies that advice and what follows in that part of the P P G. Do you want do you want to come back Mr Williams do you want to pick up this point or something else? Well it it perhaps picks up this point While your colleagues are all perusing P P G twelve. It is was really erm the question of how many other P P Gs could be taken as read er if we decide that P P G seven could just be left on its own and not included in the structure plan. Er it seems to me that erm there are probably quite a few policies in the structure plan that could be omitted if we just took the all the P P Gs as read. Erm as far as I'm concerned Mr Donson's point that there are significant areas of the county which are covered by other policies, national parks, heritage coast, high quality agricultural land, Erm that may be true but there are significant areas which are not covered by those policies and it seems to me that if erm the county structure plan is going to provide a strategy then it should be relatively comprehensive. And for that reason alone I would say that erm Policy E two is necessary and should be included. Thank you. Mr Heselton. Thank you sir. Terry Heselton Selby District. Er quite fortuitously the question thrown out by the senior inspector anticipates the point that I wanted to make that that surely it's the structure plan that sets the strategic context and it and it's wholly appropriate for local plans to put local interpretation on that. Both in terms of er bringing forward more detailed criteria based policies but also determining specifically the areas to which the policy would apply. So, for example, by designation village envelopes you would give clear guidance as to what constituted countryside and what didn't. And equally by bringing forward other proposals and allocations in the plan you would make it clear where proposals wouldn't work. And then that could even em em embrace a new settlement for example. Mr Williamson. Thank you Chairman. Ken Williamson North Yorkshire County Council. Chairman having read again the relevant paragraphs P P G twelve to which er the senior inspector referred, I I think it's entirely consistent with that that the county should seek to erm include a policy now in the plan which in effect seeks to to clarify the basic intentions of the structure plan in in regard to the attitude to development in in open countryside. I think obviously I would agree with a lot of what what the districts have said there about the strategic importance of having such a policy. Chairman I think going to the points that Mr Donson made, there have been major changes. I think it's very true to say major changes since nineteen eighty when our plan was approved. Erm we have er increasing pressures it seems to me for er a lot of er non-agricultural developments in in the countryside. Wind farms, M S As , golf courses, associated hotels etcetera, development major recreation policies, and I think it the plan needs to have a a generic policy which addresses the issue of what is likely to be appropriate and acceptable in the countryside as a framework for the development of more detailed policies in in local plans. Mr Donson. Roy Donson House Builders' Federation. We've just had a golf course defined as a strategic issue and I think that in a way goes goes goes to the heart of what this is what this is all about. That it is it it doesn't seem to me that we there is a strategic case for this for this policy. That the strategy's working perfectly well. Er and and and because they are struggling to bring forward examples it seems to me that that rather proves the point. No one on this side has suggested that we don't have policies in the structure plan because we've got P P G guidance. That's that's that's not that's not part of part of our er our proposal. The proposal really is what er do you have a policy which is not in line with P P G guidance. And it seems to me that this Policy E two is not in line with with strategic guidance and if you're not if you're having that are there some special circumstances that mean that you have to explain particularly what it is that you you have to do. And that seems to me equally not proven. Er and and on all counts the necessity for bringing forward this policy, given the existing controls that exists, given the controls that will exist in the normal operation of the development plan system, development plan lead system should I say, erm mean that that this policy is totally unnecessary. Mr Broughton. Frank Broughton Ministry of Agriculture. In principle is er not opposed to this policy er as we've made clear in our erm responses to the county provided that the wording is in our view right. We still regard the present form of the policy and the explanatory wording as being rather too restrictive. As far as the wording of the actual policy itself is concerned I think we would er certainly prefer er wording on the lines of strict control, in other words quoting er P P G rather than the not normally permitted approach. Er and the accompanying memorandum although it has er gone through several alterations which have improved it in our view is is still over negative we would see. As a whole it doesn't reflect the the encouragement to diversification in P P G seven or the er we think the recent erm quite vigorous policy statements by the Secretary of State about the importance of erm employment creation in rural areas. As far as the exceptions to the policy is concerned, we, again I I wouldn't say we had a strong feeling on this, but on balance I think it that if it is considered that they are needed they would probably be better dealt with in a separate policy. One final point I would make is is that there has been a a little bit of an impression given I think in some comments this morning that we have a a virtual free for all as regards the availability of agricultural land and er the marked change that it has been said to occur since nineteen eighty. And I would just erm remind everyone that er the clear guidance is still there in P P G seven about the considerably weight attached to protection of better quality agricultural land er and that the structure plan policy A three still remains in force, a very clear and strong policy. It's true that the protection has perhaps focused more on the higher quality land but that it is still there under clear policy guidance. Thank you. Is it is it Mr Feist? Is that how you pronounce it? Thank you. Could you announce announce your Yes. Mike Michael Feist . . Sorry? Michael Feist Countryside Commission York and Humberside Regional Office. I think one of the main reasons why we would support the inclusion of a Policy erm E two in the structure plan is because North Yorkshire is adamantly a very rural area and therefore whatever happened in that rural area must be a strategic issue. And therefore in our view it is appropriate that there should be a structure plan policy that gives broad guidance on how development proposed is affected in that rural areas could apply. Now there are various ways in which a policy could be expressed but the policy that's come up erm from North Yorkshire and the fact that it is deported by the district who would be defining that policy and interpreting it in view of their local circumstances in due course, I think er makes it a powerful factor in arguing why it should be included in the structure plan as to whether such a policy may or may not be necessary. And certainly I can think of very few other structure plans that do not attempt in some way to er give some form of er recognition to the er Government policy as set out in P P G seven. So I think it is a matter of erm importance for the structure plan its inclusion er and I think to put the an answer to one of the questions that was put earlier, if it is not to be left to the district to decide on where development is or is not appropriate in open countryside as defined in the structure plan policy, who it is intended could be making the decision on where development would be appropriate. Thank you. Mr Saunders. Les Saunders Department of the Environment. We have made no formal objection to the to to Policy E two in indicating in in many respects the department is er regional office is content for the issues to be erm as to the need for the strategic policy to be debated E I P. However if the the panel was to find in favour of Policy E two er the regional office have reservations regarding the the the tone and tenor of of the wording in the policies. You've had various references to to P P G seven, er I'm sure if we went through all the various proofs of evidence you could reconstruct the entire of P P G seven. Er the difficulties with P P G seven and the countryside are exemplified in paragraph one ten which Mr Donson refers to as his guiding principle, in one single paragraph it manages to include three separate uses of the word countryside, wider countryside, the countryside and open countryside, indicating perhaps some of the difficulties in in erm identifying exactly what area it is that would be covered by a Policy E two. The regional office's particular concerns are that the wording of the policy appears unduly restrictive because within policy P P G within P P G seven itself, no only as is the reference to protecting the countryside, there is also considerable reference to rural diversification and promoting the rural economy where as as erm the county council have said that that P P G refers to most of that development taking place er within are anticipated to take place within the rural villages and and small towns in the countryside. However, the policy itself or the wording of the of of the policy refers to exceptionally in referring to development needing to be in the countryside. It's difficult er it's the regional office's view that that is open to er an over restrictive interpretation. It's clearly a matter of balance between the various elements erm in considering erm proposals for or development in the countryside. Erm and the principle of para one of P P G one para five of P P G one applies that that erm there's no good reason for turning for for refusing applications for development in the countryside. The fact that it's in the countryside shouldn't be a reason in itself for for refusing permission. Therefore, if if the panel were minded to accept the need for Policy E two we'd have we we consider that there needs to be changes to the wording er in in order erm to make it less restrictive. Thank you for that. Mr Williamson, can I ask for your confirmation that the reason that the Secretary of State deleted Policy E two in the nineteen eighty structure plan was one of the many reasons under the heading, General, there is no specific reference in the notice of approval to the deletion of this policy and therefore I am assuming it fell for one of the reasons given in paragraphs five point two to five point four five. Is that correct please? It's not listed there. But it's nowhere listed in any of the other proposed modifications the Secretary of State or any of the other modifications the Secretary of State made. Chairman, Ken Williamson er North Yorkshire County Council. Er I thought I had my copy of the certainly the panel's report of nineteen eighty available, it it seems to have disappeared somewhere. My understanding of what what the panel said and what the what the Secretary of State agreed was that neither the panel nor the Secretary of State disagreed with the erm the general sense of the policy but felt that that sense was er embodied and and was able to to be applied through the erm provisions of other policies in the plan at that time. Er E one was mentioned I believe and er but the main emphasis was on the range of agricultural policies A one I think to A four. So it seemed to us that the the general sense and purpose of the policy was was not in a sense disputed but that er in order to avoid a leng what was considered at the time to be perhaps unnecessary detail and going into erm too much detail that er we felt that the agricultural land policies could be left to to perform the sort of main objective that we were seeking through, I think it was E three at the time, was was the proposed policy. There is nothing in the notice of approval which says that. No I think erm para five three I think was probably one of the er unless the panel found that some of policies were unduly restricted and detailed or er which were not a struc structural significance erm yeah probably the first rather than the second reference. What unduly restricted? And detailed. And detailed. I think because a the sense Do you have at the time the erm, as I go back to what I said before about the the the reliance which was then place on on the agricultural policies Yes. it seems to me to perform the functions which we were er seeking through through the proposed Policy three. to me that it would be perverse of us to fall into the trap if we were to do so of endorsing Policy E two and not know that what we were endorsing was in fact what the Secretary of State specifically rejected on the grounds perhaps that it was unduly restricted or detailed or inappropriate for some of those other reasons that are set out in the earlier part of that notice of approval. Chairman the erm proposals in the what was the submitted plan in reference seventy nine read er Policy three, Subject to the provisions of Policies I four I eight and I nine there will be a general presumption against development in open countryside except for the purposes of agricultural policy and recreation and other uses appropriate to a countryside location. It does read a bit like a greenbelt policy. That does in fact But erm Policy E two was also deleted at the same time. Yes erm Policy E two was at that time was er relating to programme of tree planting er . I can guess . That was obviously er. Could we trouble you to submit those two policies as they were submitted. E two and E three yes certainly. Thank you. I think that might be a useful point to break for coffee. While and that will give you a chance. Can we resume at twenty past eleven please? Mr Collier? Can you just hold fire gentlemen a moment? It it seems to me we've spent about an hour and ten minutes or so almost shadow boxing over this particular policy erm and we we keep running into well running both matters together and it seems right and proper that we should do that. There is obviously a divergence of view as to whether there's a need for this policy. Erm there's also a view been expressed that well if you're going to have it it may need some more guidance than is presently written into it. I think that's Mr Sedgewick's view if you have it. Erm the other point of course, this is raised in matter B, as it's written is it considered to be restrictive too restrictive er and third and secondly, is it giving you er guidance which properly reflects national guidance. And Mr Donson er has said that he doesn't think it, it in fact exceeds that. So can sort of we point the discussion in in that direction but before we do Miss Whittaker has a corollary to push with that point. Thank you Chairman. I think in fact what I would like in particular from the local planning authorities around the table is given Mr Donson's view that E two as drafted is more restrictive than national guidance P P G seven or any other P P G, what is it in North Yorkshire that justifies that departure from national guidance. This in my view is a critical determinate of leaving aside the question of fifty of fif the application of section fifty four A that determines whether the policy is required. Mr Earle. Thank you Chairman. We've now moved on in part of question your question five B and erm in my response to that I'm suggesting, and I hope it's not just semantics, picking up the point made just before we broke for coffee, is that there's all sorts of things called the countryside, and this policy is is directed at the open countryside. Now I've heard about you know the question of definition of where the edge of the open countryside is and that's a valid point but if we if we have in mind the open countryside, it seems to me that P P G seven does clearly differentiate between the countryside, the countryside, rural areas and the open countryside where it refers to development being strictly controlled. Now this phrase strictly controlled erm I I I wanted to ask it myself because I you know trying to push it through to what it actually means I think the county council if you like has taken it at what may be face value and said well strictly controlled must mean something. It must mean that there is a er an approach that says that development in the open countryside isn't normally permissible erm unless unless unless. But at least it I don't see that that that E two is inconsistent with the phrase development in the open countryside being strictly controlled. Because then the P P G seven then goes on to make the implicit point about other things that in the countryside such as the small villages and towns and other development opportunities, do occur which provide the rural diversification and employment development that is that is required by the P P G. Mr Williamson . Oh I've lost my er Ah, it's alright. Your billy do then. Thank you Chairman. Ken Williamson North Yorkshire County Council. Er Chairman I I really have to say I don't I don't really agree with the assertion that the policy is is essentially more restrictive than than er P P G seven will indicate and I would endorse what er Patrick Earle has said in in that regard. Erm the policy that we were putting forward is is essentially not the one that er was was debated in nineteen eight. It seem to me erm that was er much more intended to be much more restrictive I think than than I would suggest our policy E two is now. Erm it it in a sense er smack of sort of greenbelt policy I think . I don't think our er proposed policy two does that. In considering or interpreting what strict control means for a start erm do we actually mean, does P P G seven actually mean strictly control? If so what what does that imply? It's not sort of er moderate control or a little bit of control it is strict control. Er and we are talking about open countryside outside erm rural settlements and if you look at the wider countryside and that includes in my judgement er the pattern of settlement which is where most people actually do live in in the countryside. They're they're not living out in the in the sticks the vast majority of people, they actually live in in settlements. The policy er doesn't prevent or doesn't seem to prevent er proper development which is associated with settlements in rural areas. And there are other policies in the structure plan erm you know we shouldn't be looking at this policy just in isolation. We have a whole host of policies, some of which give guidance on erm controls in the open countryside but other ones actually sort of seek a more positive attitude to the problems and the needs of rural diversification. Erm I've mentioned one or two some of the industrial land policies as they er as they still stand policy in in structure plan policy I eight I think and particular policy I six doesn't preclude reasonable and necessary development taking place in rural areas. If one looks through P P G seven erm one sees lots of references to villages and settlements and erm more activity taking place, more people moving into those settlements. When we look at the open countryside it doesn't really to my mind say a great deal about er what is what should be considered acceptable. Erm para one ten I mean it talks about the countryside being able to accommodate many forms of development without detriment. It then goes on to say of course new development in relation should be sensi sensitively related to existing settlement patterns. And there are other references throughout to, what I reply is a clear direction that most developments should be in erm in or closely related to settlements and, of course, that will be a matter addressed through through local plans. The structure plans giving broad guidance Is it your intention that Policy E two should be interpreted as saying anything different from what is in section two of P P G seven which covers Chairman I think we farm diversification, housing, horses, agricultural development. I think probably the implications and a lot of people have er picked up on this as the policy has developed, is that er well they're they're concerned that the policy is in fact too flexible now because of how it is being interpreted by other people. Certainly this policy is not intended in any way to erm prevent what P P G seven actually seeks er to promote in in the open countryside, ie outside the areas which we would expect most development to take place in. Certainly the the re-use of er adaptation of existing buildings and would have thought that wouldn't be er er something which the county council would want to prevent. And I don't think the policy er as we proposed it er actually does prevent that. As far as the exceptions Mr Donson is rightly concerned about erm affordable housing. The county council is equally interested and concerned about that. What we have in terms of the advice for the open countryside outside the areas that would normally be looked at and allocated for development is the rural exceptions policy that forms part of P P G three. Erm this policy in my to my mind doesn't actually er exclude those exceptions being made. That would be a in the context of our policy a perfectly acceptable addition to the countryside if you like. Provided that I mean we're not talking about rural exceptions being erm appropriate everywhere and anywhere. Even with the exceptions policy there's still consideration of the the impact of that development and whether it would be acceptable or not and would be treated in in those terms I'm sure by the districts. And I'm sure the districts a lot has been said about er it being the districts' view that well you know we've got this policy so we will we will exercise a high level of restraining to protect the countryside against all comers etcetera etcetera. I don't really think that's a fair reflection of what er what what the district councils as I understand it er would intend to do. Do I take it your answer to my question is no? Yes. Thank you. Mr Jewitt and the Professor Lock. Er Michael Jewitt Hambleton District Council. Er there are three points erm I'd like to make. Erm the first point erm er Mr Donson's Mr Donson's comments. Erm Mr Donson seemed to accept that it was er right for local planning authorities through their district wide open plans to give effect to policies in P P G seven for protecting the countryside for its own sake and he er mentioned landscape policies and then development minutes amongst other things. In the context of those comments my question really, Isn't it right er for local authorities to expect that there is some strategic basis for their policies in the structure plan? Erm and I I can't help wondering, this is perhaps something that Mr Donson may well want to come back to, erm what Mr Donson's position would be at subsequent local plan inquiries where local plans were to contain such policies and there was wasn't to be a strategic basis er for those policies. And I would, and this is my second point, I would point out to erm erm point out to the panel erm that the structure plan at present erm only erm mentions in landscape terms in countryside terms those at statutory designated areas. The rest of the countryside is in effect erm a white area which tends which to me erm in a county context tends to convey the impression that er countryside issues do not matter across the rest of the countryside and that's clearly not the intention of Government advice and it's clearly not the intention behind the statutory of the structure plan which has a strong environmental basis. I think it's right and proper that there is a strategic policy which erm emphasizes protection for the countryside across the whole of the area. The third point er relates to erm is the policy stricter than Government guidance? Erm my view is that it's erm it's very flexible. Erm the margin of flexibility in the policy has yet to be determined because it will be local plans which give effect to erm erm what is erm what development needs to the statement of what development needs to be in the countryside. And that's something that can be debated through local plan inquiries. But there is the mar there is considerable potential for flexibility in the policy and that would be determined my local planning authorities in the light of P P G seven but also in the light of er local circumstances and conditions which is quite right and proper. Professor Lock. In the spirit of erm words after coffee sir, er no more shadow boxing some straight shots here. Erm in response to er Miss Whittaker's question we did not hear of anything special in this county that justifies the policy in excess of that exceeds should I say erm national guidance. There was no answer given to that question by anybody. Secondly we have not heard of anything that has changed in this county since nineteen eighty sufficient to warrant or justify in this alteration the addition of a policy the effect of which, one one with a similar effect having been thrown out at that time. And thirdly, there is a Government obstruction they don't like policies which are presumptions against development. Policy E two as proposed is a very common form of phrasing used by planning authorities to circumvent the Government objection to presumption against policies. The policy as proposed says, Development in the open countryside will not normally be permitted. If that is not in practice a policy which is presuming against development in the open countryside I don't know what is. Fourth, we've heard from Mr Williamson his interpretation of what strictly controlled means. The phrase from P P G seven. And what we can see is that Mr Williamson's interpretation of strictly controlled means not normally be permitted. And that is not strict control that is not normally be permitted. Strictly controlled should mean consented after the most careful deliberation and under the most carefully contrived er conditions. North Yorkshire's interpretation I repeat is not strictly controlled means not normally be permitted. And none of this would matter Chairman I don't think er whether E two whether E two was in or out of the structure plan only matters in so far as it bears a part of the making of local plans and the making of planning applications in the county. On the first point about the making of local plans, we're hearing that this policy has the great support, in fact was requested by all the districts in the county. I don't think they've seen it's obverse side. Having E two in place is alright for the local planning authority that wants a local plan that has no development in the countryside in it. You would be drawing sucker from E two in your anti-development policies in your local plan. So that works doesn't it? But supposing a local authority in its local plan wanted to allocate land for development in what is currently open countryside. And as I was saying to Terry Heselton over coffee it could be Selby looking for its two hundred and fifty hectares. You're never going to find those in existing towns and villages. Now supposing a local authority that wants to go into a open countryside in its local plan, E two would stand in the way of that. Such allocation would be contrary to county structure plan Policy E two. Now what we could say is well there would be trust. We have to trust the districts can trust the county the county can trust the districts and that in practice they would make this work at local plan level. For the development industry this that sort of concept of trust isn't safe enough. Section fifty four A makes your local plan structure plans extremely important governors on what happens on the ground and it's for that underlying reason that we find E two unjustified and reasonably repressive and an unreasonable extension of constraint by the county on the freedom of districts in their local plans to choose the geography of their of land allocations. Mr Earle and then Mr Donson. Thank you Chairman. Patrick Earle Richmondshire District Council. Erm I wonder if can just er continue slightly the debate about the nineteen eighty erm decision to exclude the then Policy E three. Erm I I'm speaking from recollection sir at having looked into this in the context of planning appeal which is now a little while ago, but it did strike me at the time that er there was a definite feeling that the agricultural issue was very strong protection of ag agricultural land throughout was a strong issue up to er the mid nineteen eighties and certainly was up to the time in late seventy nine early nineteen eighty and er therefore there was a feeling that Policy E three simply er was supplementary to those other policies. Also at the time I don't think that in terms of national recognition that the idea of protecting the countryside for its own sake was terribly well developed. Erm to an extent it it was er on the back of protec protection of agricultural land. Now of course during the nineteen eighties the protection of agricultural land for its own sake er lost weight as an issue and the relevant structure plan policies er lost effective weight and were seen to do so but Government policy was quite explicit in the nineteen eighty seven circular, I think it was num number sixteen, was that although agricultural land protection as a farming resource was diminished as an issue, the protection of the countryside for its own sake was not. And, therefore, the sit situation where you find yourself today erm is not the same as it was I think in nineteen eighty. Erm the second point I'd like to make is er we danced round this phrase presumption this morning, I've tried to avoid using it because its its it gets all sorts of er connotations going. I read in the Planning Press that the Newbury District Council managed to browbeat the the Department of Environment into accepting the phrase in their in a local plan, so perhaps presumptions are er the word presumption may or may not be acceptable, but then to extend it into saying well you can't even say, not normally be acceptable, and, not normally be er agreeable, for any sort of policy er means that strategic policies or general policy approaches are simply ruled out ri right across the board. And I'm sure that's not really er acceptable. And finally, if I may, the question you raised earlier and I didn't respond to it as erm I might of done, er the question about whether North Yorkshire is particularly unique. Well plainly erm whatever the er Yorkshire people may think and I was born in Nottinghamshire, erm that it is you know you cannot say it is absolutely unique. But I would like to refer you to the erm notice of approval of the nineteen eighty structure plan where I think erm there there is a phrase to the effect that a policy of broad restraint of development is erm erm er accepted by the was accepted by the then Secretary of State on the basis of the high environmental quality of the county. And that doesn't just refer to the A N Bs and the national parks and the rest of it. Erm important though they are they do not cover the the great majority of the county. The countryside in the county is is undesignated area erm outside the area er the the main designation. But that that phrase in the structure plan approved in nineteen eighty I think does give some weight to to what we're trying to address this morning. Roy Donson House Builders' Federation. I think mo a lot of the points I wanted to make were were covered by Professor Lock but I would just draw the panel's attention to erm the policy that was rejected. And if you take into account that the words, A general presumption against, were common phraseology in policies in the nineteen eighties and we now use the er play against presumption we now have to use the phrase, Will not normally be permitted. I would suggest to you that given that and also the wording in the justification under the old Policy E three, that in fact you could hardly get a tissue paper between this policy that is now before you and the previous policy. They are in fact almost one and the same and they use er one and the same justification. And so it seems to me that what has got to be proven, and I come back to the point, is that something has changed and we haven't heard anything that has changed er in in that time. In fact the justification er for the present policy actually talks about erm the erm, This policy has generally been successfully implemented across the county. That is concentrating development in partic particular places. So it seems to me that there is nothing new there is no further justification and er on those grounds alone there is no reason to have this policy. Mr Heselton and Mr Allenby. Thank you sir. Terry Heselton Sel Selby District. Erm it seems it seems to me that wha what's crucial here is the er the spirit behind the policy or or rather the the way in which it's going to be interpreted. And I'd I'd like to turn to the point that erm Professor Lock raised in in terms of the potential clash of interest if if you like between the restraint of of the policy and the er the development proposals as regards Sel Selby district. But nothing has has really changed it's surely implicit that green field sites will have to be released to meet the justifiable needs for development erm that there are ways clearly to minimize the impact by by first redeveloping the existing sites by by releasing sites in less sensitive locations, or developing sites that have minimal impact on on existing settle settlements or patterns of development un unless in exceptional circumstances there is for example the need for a new settlement. But I don't I don't think that the situation's any any different with the proposed policy as regards existing situations. But clearly it it's quite an important point so er so of course I'd be interested to to hear the county council's view on on the point raised. Erm one possible way round the I suppose would be for the county council to amend the explan explanatory memorandum er as a matter of urgency and to bring forward in it er or or at least to acknowledge some of the the matters that have been raised. Such as, for example , erm the affordable housing issue and others. Because clearly in in debating this policy I think a number of the districts have also raised diff different points of interest in terms of what should be recognized as exceptional development and we we went down that that road a couple of years ago and unfortunately the districts came to the conclusion that it wasn't appropriate to try and list the exceptional circumstances. I mean in some respects that's almost an imposs an impossible task it's simple impracticable. As soon as you publish a list for the exceptional circumstances it it will be overtaken by er evolving new forms of development for example. So I don't I don't think anything anything's really changed. There there may well be a way round the problem by amending the explanatory mem memorandum. I I think Selby District Selby District's attitude is is that we're we're perfectly happy. We we think we see eye to eye with the county council on this er provided it is clearly in the the acceptable needs of the district will be met by taking areas of countryside. Erm but I would, as I say, I would like to hear from the county on. Yes Chairman. David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council. It's a similar point to the one that Terry Heselton has has just made. I think my impression was that er Professor Lock was suggesting that because of Policy E two local planning authorities would have some difficulty in in making allocations to meet the structure plan requirement. Now I don't think that's the case. Erm it's obviously right and proper that a local planning authority if it's releasing green field sites has to justify why those sites should be released. And that's er that's a process that we've just been through with the Harrogate and Knaresborough local plan. We have released sites er in the countryside and we expect the countryside protection policy to apply outside the urban areas and outside of the sites that we've allocated for development. So I I don't think that er would would cause a problem. I'd like to pick up on a point that er that Roy Donson made also right at the outset of of the discussion is a health visitor by background, the other is a nurse, but someone who practised or hasn't practised, but as a district health community planner for a number of years. So you can see that we have quite a mixture of people in terms of our backgrounds professionally. The purpose of general management is to try and ensure that in the city that we are getting the best value we can from the health resources that are in the city, and I have the authority now, and the responsibility to spend the budget that I've had allocated from the Oxfordshire Health Authority, by Gerald Simon who's the general manager. So a big change in the way that we are arranged has actually come about through the general management structure, and we're hoping that this will give us more room, if you like to start looking at priorities, and to move the budget around in accordance with our feelings about those priorities. In that task I am assisted by a team of six managers, all of whom are professional nurses and district nurses or health visitors and they of course are there to advise me on professional issues, and to share with me the management task of using the resources of Oxford City in the way that we feel is best appropriate, and in doing that, I think one of the important things for us to do, I don't think we do it quite as well as we should, is to work more closely with the local council, and to look really at what the needs of our local communities are for health, and to try and make sure that the feelings that might well be expressed by individuals, either individually, or through caring associations, or through other statutory agencies, or through voluntary health organisations, are actually given a chance to be there, and to influence our, that official policy and constituents , and to, to influence the planning process. I've made a note of a potting of that briefing paper to you. I personally see this is as one of my major objectives over the next year or so, and in a sense it makes me trebly grateful to be here today, because I hope some of the contacts I might make today will enable me to work alongside you in what might be called even local Berkshire band, and to try and get more a multiplicity of views from different organisations channelled through our own value objectives. And it is the exciting part of my job is to make these links work, start to build on them, and over our links in the city on the environmental and group with Tony Benn , that's that's doing a very good job, he is a platform for this, for each other, but I think there's a lot more we can do locally erm within the city to build those links, and to work together for better answers for the city, and I hope that, on a practical level, one of the things that interested me was your grants team for local organisations, and I would like to think myself here today, we might look at the health authority, and try to join with them to make some erm practical contribution, particularly to those many carers, and groups of people who have problems, and we're not all just professionals best able to put over during our normal nine-to-five or eight-to-eight days, we we can. There's a lot we can do, I think, to help the community in a wider sense, and I see that as one of the key elements of my work, to try and make that work. And I'm not too concerned with the day-to-day management of individual professionals, I've got a team to help me do that. What concerns me is looking at the and trying to forge new creative links with other organisations, statutory and voluntary, in the best health interests of Oxfordshire residents. That I think is my main concern, with a request in a sense to you for supporting that over the next year or so, because I'll be trying to perhaps get invited to the meetings, and perhaps we'll be inviting officers from the authority to join me in looking at ways of building up that local context in planning to get that into our formal planning systems. That will be my key message, and the other thing I'd like to emphasise today, and I'd be very grateful for some sort of early response to that. I have discussed it with Dorothy Tomkin I think we have a genuine desire to move to a more authority-based planning system, erm, we haven't got the methods of doing that yet, and I turn to C B S and to local authority and to the traditional carers for them to join us in that. So thank you for giving me the chance to, to air that view. There are means to get a response and I'm grateful to take the temperature of the water. Right. The temperature of the water will inevitably be variably, and I'm sure we certainly welcome, lots of people will welcome your philosophical position. I would say just two things; the one on the rates scheme, we certainly as a health committee distribute fifteen thousand pounds a year and treat these as important pledge by work. We can't deliberately do not maintain those voluntary groups which we feel are appropriately and better funded by the health authority. The health authority has for years not shown any signs of so doing, I have to say. I don't want to be cynical at this stage, but years of experience that show that the health authority has no intention of doing that. And the other thing to say to from me is yes, we would love a multiplicity of views to go to the District Health Authority, I and my predecessor Betty Stanford, who were District Council Members on that health authority, we were there and able to listen to and able to contribute to the debate, the Government White Paper has taken us off, so that is not a good start in terms of how you involve the city and the district with the policy decisions of the health authority. So that's my bit of bad news. I can see Arthur, Betty and Liz. Chairman, may I first of all declare an interest in this. erm Under the new erm system erm every G P must at some time during the visit erm persons over seventy-five. Now, what are you doing to ensure that erm that this is carried out because a lot of elderly, they will not go to the doctor, but erm the doctor I believe has got to go and see them. Now, what are you doing to really see this is getting off the ground? Well, I Ian, can I ask you to save the questions and respond at the end, otherwise you'll find the discussion takes much longer, is that alright? Although that may not be appropriate view of that, but, Betty? I was going to raise the very question you raised. There we were as representatives of this city, people who are in contact with erm people who have got problems, we were Can you press your button, Betty? in my view thrown off without any reasonable excuse, because I felt that I could bring a lot of expertise to the health authority. They may not have thought of it as expertise, but when people said to me a particular ward is dirty, I went and looked at it, and in a very short time, within about ten minutes, that ward had got a massive clean-up team in there, that's the sort of thing that I felt was useful. That being said, I mean, you've lost now local, local erm expertise there. What I want to ask is, firstly, who are you funded by, and these teams, I note erm paragraphs three erm these nurses and so on, are they existing staff, or is this a new team, erm management team which has been set up at yet more expense to the health authority? So, basically, I want to know are they taken from erm a team which is already in the health service, or are they new posts funded, and funded by whom, bearing in mind the constant complaints we get from the health authority about lack of funds? Thank you, Betty. Liz? Thank you. I'm finding myself somewhat confused, I mean, I was interested that Ian had mentioned the practical voluntary services as one of the groups that he would wish to work with. I think that recently we seem to have had such, so many changes in the health authority, so many different peoples in the post who all seem to be doing the same sort of thing, who've got the Family Health Services Authority set up, but it would seem to me that some of the things that are on this piece of paper are things that I understood were being done by the Family Health Services Authority. We have a joint planning officer, and we've got quite a lot of joint erm of joint planning going on between the voluntary sector and the Health Authority and the Social Services. We've got a whole erm, a whole erm organisation that in fact the Council for Voluntary Service only this week made an appointment with a very, very, very, very small amount of money that's been made available on a very, very part-time basis, to actually assist with that, with the planning that's going on in the voluntary sector. And I think that we're constantly hearing about new people, new systems of working. erm New people who are being put in posts to liaise and to do this, that and the other, with a shrinking voluntary sector. With a voluntary sector that is erm constantly needing small amounts of resource in order to deliver an enormous amount of service to vulnerable people. And I think that the time will come some point, when the voluntary sector will say, ‘Well, we actually don't have time to talk erm to carry on talking about what we're doing and how we're doing it. We actually much prefer to get on with what we're there to do, and to, to offer services, to find, to find ways of supporting vulnerable people. So, I think my questions are, one, where does this post fit in the Family Health Services Authority? Two, how does it fit in with the Joint Planning Officer who's also ready in post?, Three, how will it fit in with all the locality planning and all the work that's already been done in joint planning between the voluntary sector and the local authority and the health authority. Thank you very much, Liz. We'll keep you going all afternoon at this rate, won't we Ian. I've seen Anne and Nonnie and I don't particularly want to see anybody else. I'm glad Liz is confused because as one of her predecessors I'm also confused. I mean, you know, we've lived with this planning. There's always been planning with the people on planning, and it seems to me that the paragraph that begins ‘A key area’, we've got some more planning. And I think really what's needed is actually going out, I mean, it could be a useful new thing that, a new departure that other people haven't done. In other words not sitting there and asking people to, erm people in authority, erm sort of people of influence, ask them what they think, but actually going out and visiting people and groups, and I was going to ask whether this would be copied to the women's sub-committee, because there are many, many groups of women who never have a chance of saying what they really want, and I don't mean patients, I mean potential users of the health service. erm The Health Service has been very much male-orientated. I'm very glad to see that there's quite a lot of nurses here, and I presume that quite a lot of those are women nurses, and I think that this is terribly important, and I think a useful thing with this new service could do is to go out and talk for instance to the meetings of women's organisations, to old peoples' clubs in the afternoon, and actually ask people what they would like, and get them talking in a nice informal way, rather than waiting for somebody to let them know what they think, because I don't think they're going to get it. So, I think that would be a useful thing for a new planning section to do. erm My ears pricked up when Mr Waterhouse did in fact say, I though he said that it wasn't necessarily help in monetary terms, but some of these people might be willing to help in kind, or in sort of helping as people with some voluntary organisations, and I think, if that was what he meant, I think there again that might be very useful, because voluntary organisations are always looking for people to help. So those are my few comments, thank you. Thank you Anne. Nonnie? As someone who has to ask occasionally for a care package for an individual, do I take it then the penultimate paragraph that this is the planning, you know, how you're going to produce a care package for an individual, this is what you refer to in the planning system, and that you're getting together with Social Services to get this care package together? Yes, Okay? Would you like to tackle that lot in the best way you can? Thank you, yes, erm to take the final point in terms of care packages, yes, are officers are working on, Social Services officers, on the professional care assistant care packages. Yes, but at what level? Do you yet know at what level that's going to be organised? I don't know. You don't know, so that's part of the planning system that we're working on? The working groups are currently on working on that, and they, my colleagues I assume are talking to the the officers of the Social Services about that, what is happening, but the final outcome has yet to appear. Just answering the first question on assessment of the over seventy-fives, that in fact really should be better left for the to say. I'm not part of the organisation. They have a responsibility for managing the U G B Contract, and you quite rightly said that one of the arguments on that contract, assessments of the over seventy-fives. I belong to the Community Oxford Health Authority not to the Family Health Services Authority, so that's just to clarify that, that did cover two questions that I was asked. In terms of Primary Health Care teams, they are existing members of staff, or health visitors attached to General Practices, and we call that collaboration if you like . In terms of a planning process Anne was talking about, you'll have to forgive me for being relatively new to Oxfordshire and coming from an area where we had a planning system which was largely the one I was describing, and the planning role that I saw I wanted to develop was very much already mentioned which was actually going round to small groups of people, to the local caring groups on a much more informal basis, and getting their contribution about that and then feeding it back into the system, which you say is there in a sense. I don't think it's rooted firmly enough in the localities. And it's that part of the jigsaw that I want to concentrate on. So if there's anything, there's a slightly different approach to it, and one thing that we are being urged to do, through the very way in which you mentioned in another context, is to make sure that facilities are appropriate locally, and developing policies within that. I don't make any apologies for that, and maybe it is going over the old ground, but unless we do it, unless we try to do it, if we've done it the way before been and it hasn't produced what we, what we want, then surely it's not for us to sit back and say, ‘Well, it's been through that and it hasn't worked’, surely we ought to try again, and that's what I hope to be doing, sort of value your support and see you . Yes, can I say to you that what you're hearing is members' experiences of the past. mhm I'm not sure that you'll be able to uncover dinosaurs as it were. Well, no, but I But of course in terms of partnership, you will have our support and any way we can aid and abet you then we shall do that, erm but you can tell from the questions and comments that we have some distress about the Yes, I get that, yes Ian, thanks ever so much, it's not necessarily been an easy ride for you, but we're glad to know you and we look forward to meeting you again. Yes, well, I hope so, we can sort of work it out. I'm sure of it. Thank you very much indeed. Bye Thanks, bye bye. You can stay of course! Don't blame you! Can I just draw your attention to your item on Urgent Business. Do you all have sight of that? It's headed up ‘Appointments and Authorization of officers’ and you're asked to authorize Stephen Stansfield, a non-professional health technician, as detailed in para. 2, it's a very normal and routine bit of work for you. Are you agreed? Agreed. So that we can get on with this work. Thank you very much indeed. On to item six and seven. You'll remember we do this on an annual basis. It's very efficiently organised for us to do. We've got Keith Dryer here, I think, of the engineers. Keith, would you like to press your button and introduce us to item six, street collections in Oxford. Thanks, Chair. Basically, the latest, and I mustn't take any credit, and there seemed to be some credit, Chair. This lady on my right, Katherine Powell, does all the hard work and committee reports, and I thought it only fair to bring her here today, because she's the person that does the set fifty-threes, She does? She's one of the members you can come to. So Katherine can answer the details on the report. Right. Welcome, Katherine. I didn't realize that's who you are. I'm the one who'll always be late getting a reply back on the set fifty threes! So Katherine, do you want to say anything on the report at this stage? I'd just like to point out that erm on the street collections as you've always done before, AvaRag and NovaSports don't generally get passed, because they don't actually help anybody in Oxford. Right That's the only thing I'd like to bring to your attention. So, you can confirm for us that NovaSports are still in that position, and I think some of us understand the nature of Avarag. Yes, erm they've got a sports centre in Nottingham, and that's the nearest thing they've got to Oxford. Thank you for saying that to us, yes, I wouldn't have actually picked it up. Chair, can I just ask, I mean, so it's organisations that are Oxfordshire rather than Oxford City. Yes. That's tended to be our line. They've not been tested solely on that, but it's on the question. Well, unless people have specific to Katherine, as I say it's presented in such a way, this report, that essentially we're asked to agree the number of permits to match the number of applications. I would suggest to the committee on page sixteen on our recommendations that we do make the point about Avarag and NovaSports, just in terms of consistency, and I would expect you to want to continue to do that. So does that mean we still grant twenty-three Saturday city centre permits? That doesn't alter that position, Katherine? No, Well, it will go down to twenty-one. Quite. Could I ask on page seventeen about Blue Cross? We have got erm some organisations, the ones I can think of is the Animal Sanctuary that we are all familiar with. erm I, does Blue Cross have any connection with Oxfordshire? Yes, they've got a farm in Burford. Ahh. Can I ask that you agree on eight one A to grant them twenty-one Saturday city centre permits, and you're clear that you've left out NovaSports and AvaRag, and you understand why? Graham? I have a great deal of sympathy with all these organisations anyway, and the tremendous number of volunteers that come out on the days. I'm just wondering whether in fact every Saturday that you've got, bearing in mind this is not flag days, this is in the street. Yes, these are street collections. That we really are putting a tremendous number of people on the street over the course of the year, erm that the general public are facing. And while I think we ought to do what we can, I think there's a line which ought to be drawn, and I do honestly wonder whether twenty-one, it was eighteen last year, and I just wonder if perhaps we should erm try and switch some of these to mid-week, so that we're not seeing it virtually every Saturday of the year. Okay, Betty? I just wanted to say to you, firstly I declare an interest in OxRad, not pecuniary, of course, with money, however, but it is on behalf of charities, it is the only way they can generally raise some two three hundred pounds in a day, or sometimes a little more, that is a tremendous help to charities. And I think that erm twenty-one is nothing like too many, in fact that's not even half a year. It doesn't mean that in fact that erm that there are twenty, my maths are right, that does mean that there are thirty one Thirty-one. Where there is not a collection, I think that's perfectly reasonable. Well, of course, there's flag days as well . Yes, well then we're also making provision for disaster funds coming up, emergency funds. Can I say that we are now organising quite tightly the business of street collections, and I think if committee are minded to reduce the number of collections that we allow, we should decide that before we come to this meeting, because I think it's very difficult in practical terms to do it at this stage, and therefore I would suggest that we do agree twenty-one, not withstanding what Graham said, we can take on board some of what he said, and maybe the month before we are asked to take this decision, we have an item on the agenda where we discuss the principle before we get down to the practicalities. Would that suit you for the time being, Graham? I think so, It made me feel that some actually seem to be quite keen to have suburban or mid-week, even though they've had city centre ones in the past. Some clearly want to switch to city centre. But I did think that it might just ease the pressure on Saturdays, because, following what erm Betty has said, in fact, as I make it it's forty-five Saturdays out of fifty-two, and bearing in mind Bank Holiday weekend, Christmas and that sort of thing, it's virtually every Saturday in the city centre there is a collection. Now that's fine, but I know some people who are in the city centre every, on Saturday, feel very guilty if they're not constantly giving, and I do think we want to get that balance. Clearly we want to support the charities, and the organisations but erm. I was just going to make a quick comment if I may on Oxfam, because I noticed that they're down for the street collections and for the flag day, now next year's their fiftieth anniversary, so I think it's quite appropriate next year, but I do, my own view is, that we will get, we ought to get one comprehensive list of all these organisations, for both the street collections and the flag days, with an indication in the column of whether it's flag day they've gone for or a street collection, so that we can identify that sort of situation. Right, I mean, that seems quite sensible actually. I would just like to point out that suburban and mid-week flag day erm street collections alternate with the city centre the following year. That was committee decision a number of years ago. Right, Anne. I think there does come a point when there is resistance. I mean, we all know that having to shake tins, the number of people who go past by on the other side, and I think that we do have to be careful with the numbers, and even those people who normally give do get a bit fed up if there are too many. So what I thought was that it was quite important to look at all these organisations that do seem to me really to have nothing to do with Oxford or Oxfordshire, and that we should be very careful. Now, if we are going to, for instance, allow I mean there's one organisation, number five, which says it's a national, although it's called Cherwell Round Table, which says it's just a national body raising funds for numerous charities. Now, if we're going to allow an organisation like that, have we no erm chance to say that after they've had their collection, we should like to have some indication of what percentage went to Oxford, so that when they apply again, we can at least know whether this is actually a genuine local organisation or national. And a lot of these organisations, it's very difficult, because there are many that a lot of people are in favour of, like, well, take King George's Fund for Sailors and so on , but how do we know, I mean, there might be two people they might help in Oxford over the course of the year. I do think it's a difficult one, but I do feel there is a limit to the number, and therefore we should be careful that the ones we agree to are the ones that interest local people. Right. I think we certainly agree with you in terms of locality, and it's open to you at any time, I would have thought, to be in touch with Katherine, and say, ‘Would you follow up on x or y’. I think if the committee did that then we'd be back to what five or six years ago, when a whole afternoon was spent on that and I wouldn't commend that to you, but can we perhaps have a word with the officers at a later stage, take it on board what both Graham and Anne have been saying, and obviously not trying to do that in a meeting like this but try to prepare for it a month before-hand. Is that reasonable at this stage? Yes so we can get progress? Chair, could I make, could I suggest maybe that in future when you ask organisations you make it harder for getting a license for street collection, that you tell them that you'll want to know exactly the proportions, but I mean put it back on to them, rather than be you having to bother to it in the future. Right, is that not done? It is to a degree, on the application form that each charity receives, it has to state whether it collects for people in the Oxford area, but not as a percentage. I think that, more, not sort of say a general question like that, but say that after the collection has happened that you want returns for the number of people in Oxford that have benefited from the number of groups in Oxford that have benefited. I mean, I think a lot of national organisations that are giving, I trust that are giving money to people actually do want to know that sort of detail about where the money is going, because, if I go through this, I mean, I would have to say that I should imagine that a very small percentage of the money that has been collected on these flag days will actually get back into Oxfordshire. I mean, my knowledge of the organisations that are there tells me that. I mean there's organisations like Oxrad that clearly, the money will only be spent in Oxford city. And the bit about it is that there may well be other small organisations that might, erm be better, erm I mean, have, might benefit people more in Oxford city, or in Oxfordshire, aren't getting in because No, that's not the case, it's open to them to apply in any event. I know, but what I mean is that when they see the city centre, the people who are walking up and down the city centre, they see all the national charities, they don't necessarily feel that they're organised in the same way and therefore that they should be participating, and the whole palaver of getting a licence and applying is actually quite difficult, it's not a simple, it's not something, we get numerous telephone calls in the office saying ‘Well can I go out next Saturday and rattle a tin for such-and-such’, and you say ‘Well, you can't’, and it's left much too late, so that people don't know about the way you get licenses to rattle tins in city centre. Don't know about the issues to do with house-to-house collection. Are we getting, erm collecting erm in the shopping centres. They just don't actually have that information, a lot of small local groups, and I think maybe the C B S could work with the Engineers department in future years and try to get to those groups, because I'm sure a lot of them, actually if they were given the opportunity in time to get in, that, that you might have a lot of people applying for flag and whatever than you do now. Well, by all means, let's do that, and has been represented in committee for some time, we have responsibility for licenses for some time, and if there isn't a dialogue now, then there'll be a good reason why there isn't, and I, I take what you say, Liz. But certainly, if we have something like fifty applications, then we'd be into a much more complex procedure. We can see why we don't, and I'm not clear about the reasons why we don't, but there you are, Michael. Chair, another query about a couple of the comments made just now, about priority being given to organisations which disclaim their proceeds in Oxford or Oxfordshire. I had a cheque for some thirteen hundred pounds raised by the local branch of National body, a body like Round Table, although it wasn't Round Table, it was another body like that, and that will buy thirteen houses in Everland in Southern India. Well, not a single penny will be spent in Oxford or Oxfordshire. Now, am I to take it that sort of appeal will have a very low priority, I mean, how about Oxfam for example? Oxfam doesn't have a low priority, clearly, erm there are, certainly we have an S.O fifty-three procedure for disasters and so forth. But there isn't a direct slot, Michael, you're right, for a project such as the one you've just described. I mean, maybe what I'm hearing from the committee is that we take it back and look at the criteria and the ground rules. I just would suggest that we don't do it in this committee. But what we certainly can do is take note of what you've said, and ensure that we get it together for you to be consulted before we take decisions next year. Graham, you've had two bites, and I really I was only going to agree with you actually, and I was just going to back-up what Michael said, and say that obviously we've got people like Amnesty International, and I know it's a very hard-working local branch, but obviously, the money it's raised is going to benefit people overseas. Hopefully so, hopefully we haven't got people within the city of Oxford that need Amnesty's help! Right, can I leave you then to the recommendations on page sixteen, notwithstanding all of the suggestions and comments that have been made, that we this year grant twenty-one Saturday City Centre permits, and the officers are clear twenty-one and not twenty-three, that we grant eleven City Centre, mid-week and suburban permits, and do you note that whoever is unsuccessful in obtaining Saturday City Centre permit will be granted one of those and given priority. Yes? Will you agree to grant three band collection permits, which you've done before, which are usually great fun, I must say. And D is part of what Michael is saying, it gives the chair, vice-chair, opposition liaison member the discretion to allow for usually natural disasters, and we would obviously want that discretion with your support. There's one final thing, and that is on page fifteen at the bottom, it's a list of organisations which were given permits for St Michael the Northgate. And I'm not quite sure why Age Concern, which has had this for I think at least twenty years for their Christmas Carols, which is not included. But I don't, the fact that they're not included does not mean that they can't have it, because that would be disastrous, because they do rely on that It doesn't, they just haven't requested it this year. Well, I mean, that is absolutely nonsense, it's tradition, I'm sure they'll have it. Can you take that up with Age Concern, Anne? There's a limit as to how much we can do for half the people in this committee are members But you see it's inaccurate anyway, because it's five two during nineteen ninety five, and they had it This year They did for last year. I mean, it's for Christmas this year that we want it. Well, can you get them together with Katherine fairly rapidly, is that a good idea? I mean, there's enabling and enabling, isn't there for heaven's sake. Chair, on the recommendations erm on item D, I'm a bit unhappy about the use of the term ‘natural’ disasters, because I believe that many of the disasters that people in Oxford are actually giving money for are man made disasters, particularly matters of international economics and the unfair burden, erm unfair distribution of wealth which places a whole sector of the world in poverty, and I think, you know, you do get a magnificent response from people in Oxford to these charities, and we must be aware that there are a whole number of greater issues involved, and while I hear what you're saying earlier on about you can't take on the problems of the whole world, I think when people are actually giving money to charities for example, like Oxfam, they are often unaware of these issues, and we do have a wider role in making the, joining with organisations like Oxfam in spreading public awareness on these issues. Right, I agree with that, and I think that we'll simply leave out the word ‘natural’ in future, won't we. Have we agreed that as a committee? Indeed, we have all agreed, I take it the recommendations under eight one in order that we can make progress. Which left the word in? So that we can report back, a month before decision time next time round? Are you happy with that? Item seven then is on page twenty-seven. This is flag day, which essentially means house-to-house. Is there anything you want to say about that, Katherine at this stage? No, it's quite straightforward. Right, the only comment I have is members will remember that we got slapped in council last year because we issued a permit to LIFE for a flag day application. I sat down with LIFE and worked through their philosophy, erm in line with our own as it were, and they agreed, and I would ask them to agree this year that any paperwork or any leaflets they distribute make it very clear that a choice remains for a woman in terms of whether or not she should have an abortion, because LIFE is fairly, yes, Michael? Did you check their tenancy agreement, because it was a pretty Machiavellian, Dickensian tenancy agreement, if you're found smoking in bed for example, you were out the next morning, those sort of things, and I think you really ought to look at that very carefully. We certainly did last year, there's no reason why we can't monitor it again, so they know we are watching them quite carefully. That might have been for very good environmental and health reasons. Yes, I should hope so. I think I would commend LIFE to you, but it will be with the same conditions and terms as we did last year, with which they did comply. Are there other questions of queries on flag days or are you happy to approve them as they stand. That's on page twenty-seven, six one, twenty four flag day permits to be approved, and we allow the officer to decide how they will best be distributed across the city. Are you happy with that? And then on six two, do you wish to grant a permit to allow a flag day to take place on one or two days during nineteen ninety-one, for the Royal British Legion? Can I have someone move something on that, please? Yes, I'd move that erm they'd be granted two days. I'll second that. And you'll second that, cross-party approach to this, are you all agreed? Thank you very much indeed. Can I ask, I know we've got Amanda Root here, who's going to help us in the Health Action Area Report, I also know that she has an ailing child, can we then take the item eleven, health action areas now on page fifty-eight, so that we can let Amanda go back to her commitments. The joint report from Amanda and Phil. Amanda, do you want to kick off on this? Thank you chair, erm many of you will perhaps know that the health authority did some pioneering work looking at different standard mortality ratios in different wards in Oxfordshire, and came up with some rather disturbing evidence that some of the wards had significantly higher incidents of death for people primarily in the forty-five to sixty-four age range than others, and Phil and myself wish to continue that work by targeting those wards with a range of measures designed to alleviate some of those health inequalities. And in this report, we've just outlined a very preliminary start to what we're doing. We'd obviously, we'd like to get the agreement of this committee to continue that work and to take it up to the various bodies and consultation. And, erm to develop it there's a timetable in the appendices about the progress we envisage making. We'd like to confirm by the end of this year which wards we're targeting and how we're targeting them, which range of erm measures that we're going to undertake. is that we've been involved in health strategy for the past over five years. The ultimate test of any health in the city strategy is what we do about the health divide. We have to do something about the equity target. And that's extremely difficult to do something about the equity target, since National policy, the distribution of income, housing policy, all the things that we tackle on this committee and committees of the council have a very significant effect on the health of the people who live in the city, and it's not in our control. Nevertheless, it's our belief that through health promotion programmes which involve cooperation with communities themselves, that we can in fact do as much as we possibly can do to actually alleviate some of the erm differences in health status. So our belief is that erm with the relationship we've been able to build up in this city, with confrontation and community participation, with the targeting of the small resources that we do have, as a council in collaboration with the other, the resources of the other bodies, that we can in fact do something. So I'll do this and I think Amanda would agree with this that this is the ultimate test that will help us in establishing can we actually do something about target one of the World Health Organisation, which is to narrow the health divide. That's out test. I would also add to that that I think such work would help us in terms of targeting more effectively the existing resources we have in terms of service delivery. Are there any questions? Sheila? Chair, I'd like to ask Amanda, I did St Clements and Petersfield . Is there any possibility of, in the near future of doing a council estate, like Barton or Blackbird Leys? erm Yes, certainly, I, I would suggest East and St Clements because they have got quite high ethnic populations, and we can perhaps be hoping to start there, because Environmental Health's already worked there, targeting some of the multi-occupation properties, so they've got a very high proportion of black people living there, which means that they're also quite important in the sense of deprivation, but, I mean, we are also very conscious that we should be working on a council estate, and what we, what I would like to do is to simultaneously be starting working in erm a particular sets of communities, is to be given work in consultation in other wards, so that you know, six months down the line before . But thanks for the point, and I mean, I'll make a note of that and take it up to the health authority. Betty and then Ruth. I'm a little surprised, chair, I could ask Amanda, but erm, Iffley is erm on the list, bearing in mind, recalling the erm point figures, where Iffley are if I recall correct was fairly well down on the league table, and Marston was something like erm six or some place. erm What connection is there between unemployment and deprivation? Thank you. erm I agree, and I actually think these figures are relatively crude, but I mean, there is, clearly there are correlations between low income, which most I mean unemployed people have of course got, and ill health. But certainly, something like Iffley's relatively surprising, it could well be, it might be because there's quite a high proportion of retired people or something, so the figures are actually distorted. erm What, what we're hoping is that erm the university's undertaking some research to actually look at the links between very small geographic areas, postcode in fact, and ill health. So when that research becomes available, we'll actually be able to be much, much more specific about where we're targeting, because I agree it's, you know, some of these are somewhat surprising. Nonnie Yes, in one five, erm they're practising notes from Eynsham it does happen to be in Cherwell ward and not North ward, erm there is a booklet out about health and housing in Cutteslowe, and I wondered what the connection between, you know, not being on this committee, but these health action areas, and what in fact is happening in housing, because the director did assure me that other wards were going to be treated to the same erm treatment. So I don't know whether that is what's referred to? Hang on, can I just check out your question, certainly we've taken the Cutteslowe health and housing audit to this committee, and so has housing Yes, yes, but that's not going to be the only one, as I understand it. That was an external one in fact Yes, is that's what's being referred to erm by the university work, because I think it's It isn't actually Is that so? It isn't. The other question I've got is presumably all this is still being done within what we've got in the budget, or is it, are there going to be extra bids? You know the answer to that question, Non, there's going to be no extra bids. No extra bids. This particular section's taken some slices already, so we'd better watch what we say to them. They're doing it within their own time and resources, but it does seem to me to be a very appropriate area for Michael? Thank you It's certainly will be difficult, Chair, but in answer to Mrs Tidley, what's happening to our housing, the answer is we've stopped building it. Government policy we don't build any housing, and therefore we've got five thousand on the waiting list, and that's why health is a major problem for a lot of people in this city, because we're not building any houses, she knows that, and she and her party do nothing about it. We're doing an awful lot in Thank you, Gerald. Yes, well, I particularly welcome this erm concentration on areas, I think it's an excellent idea, particularly in relation to housing, I think what we will find interesting is that a whole number of Oxford citizens, perhaps indeed from Barton, Blackbird Leys, Marston originally, who are badly housed in these areas and waiting in the most appalling accommodation for the opportunity of a council home. And I'm sure that this report on the health action area is going to show some fairly, erm give us some fairly staggering erm revelations about about the health of Oxford citizens that's going to surprise people at large when they find out how badly people have fared over the past ten years when we've had the Tories in office who've really done their very, very best to make the health divide of this country in a very poor state. Hear, hear Thank you, Anne Sorry I was going to go down to get an authorization from Age Concern, I missed the first bit, but erm if resources are allowed for this work, would it not be better to aim them at priority areas, and not wards, I mean, in other words, to put it to the areas that needed most. I mean a ward is going to be seen as rather a big area, when within wards there are priority areas. That was really my point. I don't think I'll bother to answer the remarks that others need to say of course tremendous resources have gone into the health service over the past few years, but I think whatever government is in power, it will never be enough for all the new developments in the health service, and that is always the trouble, whoever would be there would find it difficult. erm Your comment on wards, I think this is a way of the officers giving us something to work on and take a decision on. Once they have a decision to work, then I would doubt very much actually they're going to be into every corner of St Clements and East, or ignoring council estates altogether. We have to allow them to take some decisions within our decision, I think, but I'm sure they'll take your point anyway. Diana, and then we ought to come to a decision. Yes, I'm sure, I mean we obviously all appreciate the fact that within wards there's an area of deprivation and an area that isn't deprived. I mean, many, many wards, but that doesn't mean that we should therefore ignore a ward because it's got an area that is not deprived, you've got the, I think that by choosing East and St Clements as areas, that they seem then quite sensible areas to start with, nice central, fairly central location. I was going to say, when it comes to paragraph five, do you erm suggest that you actually think in terms of church organisations, they're not mentioned, and I look forward in in paragraph seven one to the seminar, the working seminar that's going to be in the near future, and I hope that we'll soon get a date, so that we can get it in our very busy diaries, in the hope that we can come along and learn more about this. Thanks very much, Diana. Could we add mosques as well to the churches, please? I'm sorry, I should have said all religious groups. All religious groups ! Can we come to a decision there please. Yes, just on the sub-ward level, of course there's really, there's a lot more investigations to go into targeting the resources, just I mean to target them in a city by having these standard mortality ratios for wards, but they're all below ward level, and target the specific areas. erm That's one point, the other point is of course, we have already targeted of course in working with the groups that we've defined as erm ones whose health status is at risk in effect, so this is a supplement, this is actually translating those targets we have already defined into a locality planning exercise. So we're testing, those priorities are still holding for us that but we're applying them to the localities. Thanks very much. Can I direct you then to page sixty-one, recommendations in paragraph eight. You're asked to support the general move, that we have set out from this report, and you're asked to agree to St Clements and East Ward, and I think we've heard Mandy and Phil acknowledge that there may well be a case for looking at an area of council housing, which we will leave them to do, and also to approve the set of objectives, which I particularly welcome, on page sixty-two and sixty-three, which will amount to a work programme, which I would have thought we were all very pleased to see. Can we endorse that, and ask the officers to come back to us and keep us in touch with their work. Are you agreed? Thanks very much indeed, thank you both, and I . We need to move somewhat quickly, and I am reminded that, I did see Caroline come in, but we have two people who've come in connection with item fifteen, Community Concerns in East Oxford, are you agreed that we take that now, so that they can I think it ties in very well with the item we've just discussed. Thank you, Graham. Item fifteen, and Shereen has just arrived as well. Caroline and your visitor, would you like to join us at the table, if you want to join in. So we're turning to page seventy-five. The paper is in fact written by Shereen. I don't want you to think, Caroline that we are acquitting you rapidly, I will try to acquit you rapidly, but I am also delivering what you've come for. Well, thank you, chair, for inviting me here. erm do you want me to speak to this Please do. Caroline Morrell, from OCADU, do you want to press your button, Caroline, so that everybody will please sit down normally and naturally, and maybe moved a bit closer to you, they'll pick up what you're saying. erm But I raised this at the alcohol forum, because erm sometime this summer I had a phone call from Mr Bailey here, who is a resident of East Oxford, to express his concern about various problems erm in East Oxford, problems that were posed to residents there. erm I think in fact it would be better to ask Mr Bailey to explain what his concerns were erm I'd just like to say first although initially it revolves around problems of drinking, I'm looking at other issues of East Oxford, in that recently there's been a great deal of concern about glue sniffing in sections there, and there have been various letters from residents in the local newspapers, and I think there's a general level of problem for people living in East Oxford, and it's not just that the people there want the streets cleaned up or whatever, they want something constructive and helpful to be done for people. So Welcome, would you like to take two or three minutes to talk to us about your concerns. Right. I should say first how this matter arose. It arose because some neighbours in my street effectively started behaving which was totally antisocial. There was a small group of young people who, as it happens were also associated with the bed-and-breakfast on Iffley Road, erm and several of them had moved between this house and the bed-and-breakfast. Their activities ranged throughout the day and night and reached a peak of basically making a noise nuisance of themselves, there were other troubles which I will mention later, in which they would be playing two or three different sound systems, and at its worst, a full drum set in the early hours of the morning, obviously keeping their near neighbours not only awake but in a state of some anxiety. I live directly opposite to them, and there were two of their neighbours who effectively unable to carry on a normal life throughout most of the time that they were there. This was taking place on five or six nights until early mornings a week for several hours. Eventually a noise abatement notice was served on them, and erm immediately after that the landlord offered them a hundred pounds to leave, and they left. He did that because they had not only annoying his neighbours, sorry, their neighbours, because he had once been one of our neighbours, but also they had damaged his house, and they had already cost him probably about two hundred pounds in repair bills until the house itself, broken doors, window erm the wall, and bit of the roof and so on, and there was every reason to believe that this would just carry on. Now, erm I think I should make clear that I have some personal feelings on this, and I just want to say something very briefly about my neighbours, something I actually don't agree with . erm There is a general concern I think with multiple occupancy that there's, a whole way of life of East Oxford is changing, and not for the better, and indeed I was part of this when I moved into the area ten years ago. erm And the, a lot of this was not specific to drug or alcohol abuse but simply to multiple occupancy. And we've now reached a situation in which there's something over twenty percent of our streets is multiple occupation, erm and this is noise and other activities in relation to that are the things that cause the sort of low level of concern, and this was just the peak on top of that of major aggravation. erm I think there are one or two of the elderly tenants in particular who felt really very anxious about activities at night time, and they're going to have their property stolen, or things thrown at their house. I mean these people, there's things like throwing broken milk bottles, throwing milk bottles into peoples yards, removing bicycles, picking up my bicycle, as it happens, and throwing it down several times, erm going down the streets playing a sound system full volume at two o'clock in the morning, which generally left people feeling they didn't know what was happening. This was only part of a general sort of pattern as it were, where people were beginning to impinge on their lives, there was another well-known local alcoholic there who was knocking on doors trying to get money off people, and there's several elderly people who gave this woman money, because they were frightened that if they didn't something would happen to them. So I think I can express some of my neighbours concerns, unless, particularly, not particularly worried about those, but there is a general feeling that things are getting worse, and that they're not safe in their own homes, among the more elderly. erm And obviously a few people don't like the sight of people on the Cowley, the Cowley Hospital site, and things like that. This doesn't concern me. I do feel I'd like to say one point about the people who were in this house, that it's quite clear, all of them I believe were under care of the social services, erm and I don't know enough about their history to say whether they, where they've been before, whether they've been in some half-way house, or just been thrown out of some mental institution. I'm virtually certain that the woman from whom we had most of the aggravation had been. She was clearly mentally disturbed, and the reason that I got in touch with the legal project was to see if there's anything that could be done by them to start giving her some way of getting in touch, getting to solve her problem. Obviously this was done out of self interest, but I really, the woman was in real pain. She was an extremely angry, very bitter woman, who was determined to get everybody around her as angry as she could, and she succeeded, and I don't know where she's moved now, but I'm sure she will go on and do the same thing, and frankly, I despair of anything being done unless there is some provision made for people such as herself, and one of her friends in particular. That's really what I'd like to say. Thank you very much indeed, I think that's fairly fair, but none-the-less honest way of setting out your feelings. This is quite a specific issue, and I'm not sure that this committee on this day is in the best position to discuss it in detail. Obviously I'll take your advice on that. I do think as far as placing people in houses in multi-occupation, we acknowledge that. How is it done, by whom, who thinks about it, is it planned, is there support, and for that reason we are arranging a meeting, Frank, together with the Health Authority with all those agencies who do place people, sometimes quite sick people as you rightly point out. So that is certainly on line. Now, I know that what Shereen asks us to do, and I'm sure Caroline as well, is to organise a multi-agency meeting. We've done this on the proposed East Oxford Education centre. I think we can very usefully do this, and iron our way to this. What we need from you is really a specific proposal about the kinds of groups and individuals that you want us to sit down with. You can either do that now, or we can agree in principle that we will take this up. Perhaps chair, vice chair, and opposition liaison member if you feel that's suitable. And call such a meeting. I think it will a long way, but you're quite to draw it to us, and to ask us to set out on that road. Michael? Yes, chair. What sort of people would you involve in this meeting. I mean there's a lot of voluntary organisations who are working in this field, I don't know how you would Done a farm house for one of the King singers in er Oxford. Yeah! How did he Harry Secombe , I think is in the we get the Sunday Observer you know, they have the Yeah. magazine, there's a Mm. a room of my own I think it was, it Mm. shows you the houses of, you know That's right, yeah. it's usually writers or, in this case But the one he had at Cheam was a lovely house!

Yeah, I know. They don't want it half price They don't realise! they want it for a You still got the fifth! same overheads Heating. heating costs and , yes. compost and all of that. And the work is tremendous Yeah. doing that sort of thing, I'd, something I would never take but there you are that's people for you! What? Like this game to some extent isn't it? The furniture they want it somebody'll want it done for no I've broken many the dowel or tenon or something like that! Oh! In just Erm watering? Well, I mean, say it's like that where you just polishing with a cloth or something Yeah. but he has a an actual syringe er, mortaring tenon you know. Ya. Say that was a tenon there the underneath part of the chair you're not gonna see drills a hole in there Mm. and then jegs and after a few five minutes Yeah. doesn't get you know, it breaks down the glue inside. and that hasn't broke. No, no, you've been lucky there but Yeah. it's a good tip that you know, isn't it? I've never heard of it before. Michael? Michael the erm the up , the furniture restorer that's erm he's coming here. He's not here. Three hours every Tuesdays for the second years Oh yeah. and giving us tuition on real antique furniture, he doesn't do anything in his shop erm after eighteen forty or it's all more or less Georgian, very Georgian actually. And whereabouts is he? In er Heswell I, I've never been there, he's got a workshop in Heswell What and you go on a you go on a course there? No he co , he comes here. Oh does he? When is He that? wants He comes here on Tuesday? On on a Tuesday, he wants to go and teach you see, I think he's got arthritis in his one leg. Is he er the man with a beard? Yes. Mike, he's called?

And and yo I you do it his course here on erm Well he he sort of came and asked us, you know do you mind Yeah. he he's gotta do this thirty hours I think it is to I see! to get this Teaching? other exam. Yeah. As I say, they he qualifies you see. Yeah. Er so it's mainly erm what I've just been telling you about cleaning all Mm. screws, how to identify furniture and mainly ol and his methods are totally different to what we've learnt here, especially with polishing Mm, mm and that. Mm. Uses hardly any polish it's nearly all waxing though. Is it? Oh! Stripping and everything's a different technique. Oh very good! But he And that's part of your three days is it? You do three don't you? Yeah, ah that's right, yeah. Well er, the Tuesday is supposed to be furniture restoration, that's what it's been And yo , that's but then he started doi you know, a few weeks ago it wa , well it'll be the fourth week I should think! Mm. And Fourth. who do you do the er for? Furniture restoration. Well that's the the three day, you know, George i he's George, Bill and No, Bill doesn't go in! No, He doesn't ? This is just woodwork. Oh I see. Ah well we do a bit of copying. Now that's, is is that in this class here? In this room? The first years come in here for upholstery. Mm. We go in there to the woodwork And that's on Tuesday mornings? Tuesdays. Yeah, yeah Oh I see! It's a fiver each that is. Some I wouldn't mind doing that. Well, I I liked it, you know it's it's so interesting and er he is very good! Trouble is, some of them have made the mistake I think, of saying well it's not good for us because we don't do really old furniture you know. Nobody's gonna come to us for the lease of erm William the fourth or anything like this! No. Or William and Mary and say er can you do, they're gonna go to an expert like him. But then if they got tips You never know, you might have to do a top of an Yeah. old, really old Yeah. table. And not just go on and strip the Yeah. which Yeah. he's still really tha that's a Yeah, you ca of him that is. No. Don't, never use that stuff! Makes his own wax! Does he? Showing us how to Yeah. we're gonna do some between us. So if he's got to he's ga got to re re-buy something then he just clips it down with sandpaper does he? Oh no! No, just cli , and yesterday he'd got this marvellous cleaner he uses. Just wipes it. It just cleans. Cleaner and then er wire wool at at the last Mm. resort Mm. but oh he he, he does do stripping obviously but the Yeah. the stuff he uses is ve isn't as caustic as the stuff we No. use. No. It just takes the surface off. Yeah. Yeah. And then th , the object in the, is to build up a pattern Yeah. there you see, so it still looks old. And he Yeah. does a lot of patching, somebody's got a cigarette hole you, you've gotta match that up. Yeah. Very interesting! Yeah. But it would pricey If I wanted to come you see, I'd have to pay again! Oh well , yes, yeah, oh well I wouldn't be coming. I'd have , I'd have to pay for it. I have to That's right. pay for everything I do, you know. It's part of my second year, so yeah I know. Yeah. So I'll be in the same boat as you next year. Will you? Well yeah, I've had a come for one day, pay for a day and hope I can sneak in on the two day. That's what Ya. you can do. Mm. Yeah well we could I mean, Joan said well ma , you know make the numbers up, once you're here come in on the second. Well we can still be away for about four lessons at four thirty so er Well that makes up and he'd been away for three months so that you know I mean Well you see Eric was offered two months. Little Eric, the one that's always Yeah. in there. So the let him come in the day, two days he was off two months, Christmas time, How is he? with his bad back. Tha , well he went to Spain for a month to sort of recuperate. Yes. And and come in on the, he came on the Tuesday and he's been three days a couple of weeks so Eric will be pleased at that. Between friends I think I haven't got a bad back, she had me Wings on you would wouldn't you? Ooh yes! Yes. The wings go on last don't Last they? yeah. Yeah, yeah. Ray, can I ask you ? Sorry Pat, what? Have you got glue from the No. Yes. Kept this space There? specially for you Pat. Oh that's very sweet! With you in mind. Well erm Mary's here so she can budge up a bit. Yes. A gem you are! There's usually another guy here today so he hasn't showed up, so there you are so we got bags of room. From what I've heard she'd got no chance that lady! Well yes. As long as you're alright. Bit shocked really I suppose. Yes, well it is! Yo you sort of er if you ran into someone you know, you do something silly it's it's it's it's automatic to say oh I'm sorry we will you know how much Yeah. ? Yeah. But today, especially these youngsters the attitude is I'm Yeah. not saying anything! Course it is, you say anything Now it's sticking out a mile, but the time home that make up another ruddy story to give Yeah. to their insurance I mean Oh yeah. it's awful. But Oh she blamed me, she said I was coming round the corner at high speed! And I, we weren't anywhere near the corner! We were this end sorry, we were this end, you know . Yo you were stationery were you? I was stationery. She got no chance! You ran into a , I mean if she's reversing She reversed She's not looking, she couldn't of been looking! She's she's looked then she's taken her eyes off the back. Yeah. Must of! Well, she probably didn't look at all! Could be. I mean I I I said, I hooted her as well. Mm. And er That's fatal! But I I was always taught, probably like yourself that you must look through that, turn round and look through that rear Yes. mirror. Cos if you take your eye off for a second, bang somebody's there! Oh yes. So I don't think she's got much hope now you know. Have you got witnesses anyway? Yeah . Oh! I hope sa er , see of course it's all question of getting it sorted out as quickly as you can. There's the insurances and the tale that she tells them but tha , I think they'll have that weighed up you know. Ha! Well I hope so. Cos I had an awful experience about ooh, four years ago, I had this old Moggy Morris Minor coming along very slowly north of Hull it was and this chap and his about finished work you know, so I going past this cri , there's a cricket match going on and he was looking like, I could see and his girlfriend! And the car just went like this into the middle of the road slowly towards me I swerved onto the grass Yeah. verge and he caught my back bumper an an ripped it off you see! Got out the car, said good God lad what were you doing? And he never said anything and he said something like, I'm not saying anything. I said you ran into me, look at the position of the cars! Ooh no, he said we'll swop insurances that's all he'd say! It was his dad's car. Yeah. His dad was on holiday. Anyway, I, I should of got the police there and then and had Yeah. him breathalysed although it wasn't Yeah. drink or anything but Yeah. police said to me afterwards you should of we can't fight your claim you Yeah. should of had him there and then and measured up the road a bit Yeah. we could see how Yeah. you're too late to have ended up knock for knock. It's as though Yeah. it were partially my blame you know. They paid half of erm Yeah. totally his fault you know! But these youngsters today they could kill Yeah. someone they wouldn't er Yep. they wouldn't be compassionate about it you know. Well I proved I was stationery this morning there's no way she's right. Oh no, I think you got a pretty good case there. It's nasty though isn't it? It leaves a nasty taste in your mouth. Where are you, North Wales, Chester? Yeah. I thought, ooh by that Yeah. you know. Anyway, one lady came came to the house whilst I was here and she said oh it's not quite what I want. last week getting married. Just a . Put a deposit down will you, oh can't Yeah. pick it up till the weekend. Yeah. But I'd come down to er, one two five you see in the local paper. Oh! So anyway, it's gone. As I say, it didn't cost Yeah. me much. Didn't cost me No. anything to to buy that one Oh well. so er but it's stuck there for er weeks on end, you know we've been finished it Yeah. bit of a . And the ? Oh yeah,tha , that was Lorraine you know Lorraine that was here. Yeah, but then I suppose But then she's you know, otherwise hers . Where does sh where's her shop? in Wallasey Oh, in Wallasey again? Ah. I see, yeah. Oh well I could go there and have a look, anyway one day Yeah. because is she the only one there is she or She might be interested I don't Yeah. I don't know whether the other girls go round with her but erm what's the other girls name that was here? Wah I didn't know that very well. I knew Oh! Lorraine because I, you know She ru she, she does her own work she starts being Oh yes, there was another girl, yeah. Yes. A friend of my daughter's went in the other week and bought a little erm table off her erm and, you know, it's quite , I mean it's all, that's it. Wanted some new furniture. Trouble is she only wants to buy it off you cheaply you see, for If you can, it's how she does it, she might erm Sometimes they sell things for you don't they? And charge you for it. That's what I was gonna say, I she liked that new erm in there. I know Yeah. she did do that, what they get for it erm Usually they're pushed for space as well, you see, that could Yeah. be the other thing, you know. It's been there er, for sale for a few months and sold it by February at a That's right. loss. To save on . She had the Monday market didn't she?like all things, you know, though people do tend to go in and look and then say ooh yes, very nice! Yeah. We'll think about it and say ooh oh you have this don't you? Especially at lunch with the they come up and spend Ooh yes. little bit on , they're still buying. Ooh yes! Because they're going they go by the band road down south. And sell it much dearer there obviously so er you know They, they still buy it no, okay I can charge where in this economic situation and we think . Oh no, no! No I no, there is erm We bought , we bought stuff ourselves you know, to people and we've spent on it, so Yeah. It's my last weekend but it was such a scramble! I was, wanting to get home I, I couldn't Mm. be bothered but erm Yeah. Well you know the erm Handbridge ? Yes. Yes Well you Yes. but I think there's only one shop there, The Pearl Antiques just over the bridge on the right hand side Over the bri , oh I know yes! A anyway that they call Vineholts Vineholts is a cake shop right opposite there. Oh yes , that's right yes. Well I hadn't been there for ages! Have you got a a row of shops on your left by the pub Yes, and then on the right then er er a park on your right and right. then a couple of the shops, and she's about on the corner this Oh, well I haven't been that way yet. Just a couple of ladies erm well it's one lady, I think er the lady just helps her. We've been in a couple of times and I said that I wanted a chaise you see ooh I got this erm one for Victorian one it's very nice, and lovely warm you know, the legs anyway it was one one thousand three hundred you see, so I thought, oh I said well I didn't wanna I beg your pardon? Well that's what you can spend now for a good one. But this is ready to take home but I said oh, can I have it out? She said, yes. That's finished is it then? Oh yes, yes! Had to be. Oh, yes, yes, yes! Only one seat then? Oh yes yeah. I said to her have you got one that's in bits? But er for three hundred, you know er but er er But the back was loose! And I said, and she said oh well she said you know well it's that's how you've gotta take it stripped, for me to take that to get that done up by a restorer you'd have to take all the upholstery off, or quite a bit off Well I was gonna say and then if it'd go up to about one seven she said, and I couldn't sell it here she said, I'm not Chester prices I'm just that bit cheaper. Which, a lovely lady! But But I thought, I was surprised to see it was loose, you know. Well that's it, I mean the joints You've gotta take it home like that. the joints have got to be done haven't they? The joints have gone and this wanted doing but it would of been extortionate she said, you know, to get it done Yeah. and then try and sell it you know, take Well that's alright. all that into account. I think it's terrible really! That's bad! And I've seen chairs like that, I've seen I don't know whether it's there but a couple of places, bedroom chairs, gorgeous things, you know! And the backs! You know, you can do this with the back! I mean, you don't like saying to the people No. you know, because No. their faces drop when you They do. you're not supposed to say You'll be marked man when you get in there. You're supposed be glad that it's old and don't sit in there, you know th but er it's bad, but though isn't it? It is. Well you know, you turn things out here and you go in you might see that little Yeah, put it in and magnified in your mind aren't they? That's right, like my my . That's alright. I like it.

And he's very good! Very good top quality you see so he's gotta have it right. That stuff. It's handy to know the right way to do it innit? Yes, I suppose it is. And I mean the way he did that table I suppose cos he It's nice that table anyway! That old one's gone, you know. So I'm looking forward to seeing what he does with that. It's a nice approach I think. Mm. And he makes it interesting. Mm. Whereas Bill Bill tends to be a bit I don't know se dictorial doesn't he? This is how it's done get on with it I'm going now! You know, and then if you ask him again he says, I've told you once! But he does get funny! He's a funny man! What do you want, a chair? Yeah. Er, there's one over here look! There's one left. He's got that huge nice house! Yes, I know! I know what that means. Do want a pouffe? These Coxes are nice! One of my favourite apples is erm er, a russet. Yeah. We left that really. But the last, really seem to be tiny now and Yeah! I They're not nice when they're full of that's a horrible colour that one! Yeah , and just a, as an old old taste about them! I get my favourite apple . Oh! Some of them are a bit tasteless I find. Mm. Absolutely no taste at all! What like a peach? Yeah. You soon get fed up eating it don't you? But you'll soon find that it only needs one . I am. Do you want my core Margaret? It's Used to say that in Liverpool ! I thought . Can I have your core? Ooh God ! A And then again have chair, you know,pe , people are reticent of it, they're frightened if it goes Yeah. I'd be hopeless! I wouldn't be able to do it, keep up Yes. with cos Well when we had the open day and we had a lot of people round here! Yes. It's really interesting! Yeah. Yeah, I notice Joan tapping at the saying, ooh ooh ooh ooh! Yeah she's sewing them all up for Friday! Has she? Yeah. Oh, didn't know. What do you mean vell Well no, a whole of vell he's going to go get some give me some For, for September? Bit early yet isn't it? Well, it could have been Won't have the roll and foam. well then put it. Well, I wouldn't of thought Won't be so they wouldn't be allowed to join won't be hardly would they er hardly anything left now. No. And I don't know how many dropped out so twenty two. I'd well I suppose they could do couldn't they? Mm. And it's not gonna cost anything so the I mean Pat started late with us, you know. She she missed about two months, I think, Pat. But she soon caught up, you know it didn't make any difference to her but There's John next door, he di , he just started a couple of weeks ago. About five The young chap? Short chap? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he's doing brilliantly! He's , he's marvellous on the upholstery. On the upholstery, yeah! Well He's only twenty! to go Yeah. into somewhere Erm you know the the the table that he's doing now he's doing the varnishing the table, you know and he really in! You know I always it's terrible! Some people seem to drop in don't Yes. they? Others have a bit of a tough time especially I think with ladies Well I found it easy. they're join , doing joints and that, you know, er I mean,tha tha Sheila, she said oh I'm not interested at all in doing mortars and tenons or Yeah. you know ! Yeah. But then if you want to do the restoration yo I've have a go I'll have a go at them they were they didn't look very good but, I mean, at least I did them, you know Yeah. I Oh, I think they're and maybe you you you you improve with testing them. Yeah. Got to! Both got Oh! The that Yeah. realise actually You get too busy you know, for what you've got to do to Of course! Yeah! I mean, look at now look at me or the guys with the sewing machines I mean Yeah. Ya. The The these hands weren't meant for sewi but I mean yo you do get better. Oh yes! It's surprising! Especially when you you know, just like a . She really has got . Mind you she looks a bit tired now, asleep isn't she? But er well this is no good! Well I The whistle's gone. Come on Shirley, I, you're Oh! usually first up for that! We're always rushing ! Yeah . No you're not. I'm going Mrs . Again? I don't thi I don't think Miss They don't call her part-time Shirley for nothing you know! Mind you, when she's here it's worth it! Ah! I see. Now,i are we interested in going to the Yes. It's on the sixth of July and it'll cost forty pounds. Forty! And then you said twenty five quid! I've been told that on Tuesday. It's gonna be forty Mind you, for that, girl pounds. it's worth, it's worth it! Forty pounds, right I'll get a bit of paper. He, He went into hospital and they said erm that it's the muscles of his heart that were affected they couldn't do anything more for him! Just sa , you know, so he said right well I might as well go home. So he went home and he out about two weeks got fed up, you know, like that man you know, doing nothing so he had a scooter that needed repairing he died as he repaired the scooter! She went out his wife, shopping left him tinkering with this scooter came back, couldn't get in then she did get in and he was dead on the floor! Good grief! What a terrible for the wife! Sixty, sixty! You don't know, I mean he could of gone if he'd been lying in a chair wa watching the Oh yeah. telly you just Mm mm. don't know! I mean at least he was doing something that Yeah he liked. stretched out on the floor! But of course, I mean, we know little about it they do say if you have had a heart attack it's no good you know, as soon you get up and you start eating going for five mile walks Oh no, that'd it's gotta be a very different. gradual thing. Yeah. I mean But yo you must exercise but Yeah. obviously using a bit of sense Yeah. as well. Perhaps he's, perhaps him something or Yeah. strained. Well standing or you know God I dunno! He probably was told to go home and take it easy, you know, and Mm. He's like me you get well like most You can't men they get fed up, that's like I know most women do the same. oh yeah bu you see, er er, you're not supposed to life anything for if one of my grandsons falls over, the first thing you do is pick him up you know! And then er It's so constricting! Yo yo you, you been used to working hard and if they say don't do this Yeah. You don't do it. I I'd go mad I would, honestly! Mm mm. Mm. But I I er remember Margaret, my wife when she had the er the last one which is a a gap of about ten years between the third you know, and the fourth child Yeah. so of course she had to in hospital so, have this on my pregnancy, you know Yeah. and we'd lost one. Mm mm. Mm. Oh didn't wanna leave home, but anyway she went in and somebody said, oh it'll be about a week you know from the middle? You can have the bunch splitting. Cos it being a big window I think Yeah. it's better. I'll just tell you about if you have it splitting. Mhm. Erm the two middle louvres that come together will overlap slightly more than the others. Yeah. Right. So the shadow w when the sun's shining You can see a slightly thicker one. becomes sl er slightly larger. Mm. That's the only er difference with those. But if er if it all going to one side I think it's going to be take up half the window won't it . I think it could be very heavy here wouldn't it. Mm. look better going. It wouldn't quite take up it wouldn't take up half the window . Wouldn't it? No. But a fair amount. It also depends if you have your windows open and you've got them each side and a bit of a wind, they'll be flapping . Yeah. Mm. think about that as well. Mm I I I still think the middle. You want it to open from the middle? Yeah. It's this sense of proportion isn't it? No it's not really what I prefer. Yes. Right. And what about the bottoms? Presumably they're chained . They're they're they're all chained together Mm. with weights. And they they go a hundred and eighty Yeah. degrees? That's right yeah. Cos obviously that's quite necessary . Mm yeah. The way the sun comes. Which end do you want to have the controls? Well it would have to be this end. You want the controls this end? No no sorry same end as the other one, same end yes the same end . Yeah it's a bit more difficult to get in there isn't it. Do you want to order now or do you want a quote? Could you quote ? Probably the best is a quote . And then we'll Cos we've got one more person to talk to Right. yet. Okey-doke. . if you can give us the the two alternatives for the the Dunes one and the Spice Oh I'd better just er . So it's the Dunes is the That one. that one. The dunes is the preferred one. Is the preferred one. And then there's the Spice. Mm. And was it the Snowdrop? No. just those two? Just those two. I like the texture of that other one . Which one? That well the . The Spice one. Spice one but er Yeah. You like the pattern of the Dunes one. Well no it's not that I just think it's the I don't know you can see through it more. Yeah. I Is it Mr ? yeah. As in the flower. And the address again please. . And your phone number? is . Why am I saying all these . With the er white headrail or chocolate brown? White. White? White . That doesn't make any difference to price does it? No. What width are the are the vanes of the the louvres. Er they're five inch. Yeah. These are three and a half so they'd be slightly longer. Yeah yeah. Slightly wider. Mhm. Well I hope they will be slightly longer. . Yeah. Right . You want it split? Yeah. And you want it er controls on the Left. And the other one was Spice White. Right I'll write this out again and if you decide to go ahead, Yeah. then just cross the one out you don't want. Okay. Mhm. Yeah. Otherwise you get two. Yeah. Which could be quite fun. Well you you'd have no problem with sun penetration then would you. No you're right dear. No. That would be We already have a roller blind on the outside I see which is useful for taking the heat off the window itself in the Summer. Yeah. But it doesn't have any effect It doesn't take the light off. . I mean that's got a very open weave texture. Mm. Ten Right, I'll let you fill that in when you're Okay yeah. It's a Newark phone number, yeah? Right. There's a little bit more for you. competition on the toes. Right I'll give you these. Right. Erm if you want to go ahead with it, pull the top one off, Yeah. pop it into one of these prepaid envelopes Right. with the deposit in. And it'll be twenty pound deposit. Twenty pounds . Mm. Yeah. And then as soon as our office gets that it'll be two to three weeks. Right. That says plus thirty, that's that's inclusive . No Well I'll just put it on. Thought thought I'd better ask. Yes yes . Thank you. and that'll be attached and when we come to fit it, if you keep hold of the one you keep Yeah. you needn't sign that now It looks a bit complicated but No no. No not really. got the idea. Well that's marvellous thank you. I've been thinking about these blinds for such a long time. Yeah. Really just I mean a roller blind's just too the window's too wide for a roller blind. And then at least you can see through while you're shading the sun from that direction and then That's right yeah. the other direction. seemed to be the answer. Well thank you very much. Yes, you've got your measure. I've got my measure yeah. Yeah. I've just well and truly broken mine, you know I chipped the end of the Yeah. tape on the it went and did it again on me now and it's well and truly gone I'll have to buy another one. It was a nice idea. put this back. Oh don't worry it's very very it's very easy. There you go. They're all on rollers these days. Oh right. Right thank you very much indeed. Hello there goes the phone . I'll answer it dear Right okay. Come in, come in, come in. nice to see you. Well what can we do for you today? Oh, I've a infection in my gum Dr . In your gum? Up here. Yeah. tablets and noticed that, I don't know,. Let's have a look and see what they've done to you. Aye, the Sofradex not doing very much for that is it? No, I've never taken them, I've just, I stopped taking them. Aye, I don't think they're doing very much, do you. You see I've had it here, I take it quite often, I take Right. sores, Dr gave me these to clear them, and it does clear them up. Eventually. Eventually, Right . but I was getting bacteria and germ, you know, Mhm. and I'd rather so I so I put a description in, asked for a description yesterday, Right. cos that would give the rest of my Right. my things. So she said it wouldn't be done till tomorrow morning, but I need something, Right. And I've been up till, I've been paining me all night Doctor , Aye. I'm just wondering if it's my teeth or that it's just my blood that's doing it . I think I think it might be s the the teeth, it'd be worth getting the er dentist to have a wee look at your your plate, Mhm. because there might be a wee rough It seems to be catching up here. Aye, might be a wee rough bit in It was all rubbing, and really painful all night Dr . And will I take these Sofradex? Yes, yes, keep on with those just now. And I was going to take them, I was going to take them, and I said, Oh I'd better, I'd better see Dr first . Aye, get Daktarin erm gel and put that on Mhm. three times a day between meals. Do I just spread it on my plate, you know? Aye, just a wee drop on your A wee drop, on on your finger and just cotton bud it and rub it ? and and rub it round top of your plate, just put straight from Awfully painful. Oh aye because you're right into the flesh. It is. Right into the flesh. Do I take these as they're prescribed here Doctor ? Yes, aye, two fou one or two four times a day. Yes, one four times a day. Fine, yeah, aye . Just take, just take, I was gonna take them, I says,I couldn't stand the pain any longer, Yeah. it really was, put me off food and everything Dr . Aye, oh yes, when you can't, when you can't eat it's not much fun. Here we are now. And how's, how's young Dr doing, is he? Dr , is he doing alright ? haven't seen him, it's Dr I think that's attended me the last time. Aye. I haven't seen him, I think I've doc seen Dr once. It was a wee, it's it was last year when you saw him I think, Dr No. , was it not? No because I got my gallbladder out in January. Aye. It's it was before So that that you'd seen him. Aye. Seen that much That looks like Dr . Ah I seen . That's right. Aye, it was November, November. the last time you saw Dr Oh it was Aye, well I seen him, He came up to see me when I was in , Mhm. when I was in getting my gall bladder removed. It's turned you into a human being yet? Oh No. Will I just pout the gel on or Yes. can I? Just just put the gel, don't don't wash your mouth out with anything. No, I was using some, I was washing with a mouthwash in the morning. No, Oraldene. no. No? No. Leave it, leave it alone, Leave it? leave it alone. Use your Yes, aye, just use your gel and your your er Sofradex tablets, yeah sofradex tablets, just take what's in the just take what's . I seen Dr , Monday, he was a clinic for before I went beck, a week on Friday for injections. Again? Again. Absolutely. In the bin. That's the best place for it. took him two reactions, Aha. to get platelet, to get platelets, two reactions . I must have screamed. Away and yourself. Right Thanks very much Doctor, thank you. Bye Mrs , cheerio now. Right, erm, eighteenth of January, er, Department of Finance and Administration Cascade Meeting. Er, Great North House, Northern Development Company. O K Marion, would you care to kick off? Yes, O K, erm, I brought what I thought would be a help from last week. Did your report back?we didn't have a meeting the first week, did we? Marion? and I wasn't in the last week so I doubt whether Do you want one on last week?, It's all there I assume, O K, right, O K, yes Erm, the quarterly report went out towards the end of that first week, erm, with the annual finance statements, erm, we're ple , quite encouraging because of the erm, S and E enquiries, were actually done on his proportion for once. Only just, but, because er, a hundred and eleven, if the enquiry's a hundred and six or constitutions, which is quite good, and obviously December was really quiet but then that's standard anyway, because , quite possibly not because it was sort of erm, he's shown with an which didn't So it's something folded back on one side yes,? I mean it's not that vital to me, but I hadn't Yes Yes. , but I'm not surprised, so, erm, in our previous visit they did give us Then was down in Middlesbrough for a couple of days that week, and er, I think amused everybody by calling it miserable all the time, I dread to think what . I told you how he was on the phone that day, I mean, he hadn't the foggiest idea of what, what he was doing or where he was going, I don't know. I think he got on er, quite well down there, because he'd spent a few days up here he had a better idea of what he wanted to ask, and what he wanted to talk about and so on, but erm, only because his deadline's and do you want to ring? Ah, right, I don't, I think it's now been called regional Christmas Day Makes a lot more sense, O K At Mercury, he clocked the sponsorship erm, late last year. Right, I must get some literature actually from Barry because as you know, it, it, we can't get it all out of the now, Right, oh and Phil went to the Stoke conference on that Thursday and Friday. He got bored silly and considered it a complete waste of time. Which I did try to tell Erm, I seem to remember that's the day that East Anglia kind of just disappeared in Mm, yes, yes. That's right, I was supposed to have a meeting on with erm, a couple of guys from the British Coal Enterprise down in Middlesbrough with , but unfortunately again the weather caught all of them out and they decided not to come, but didn't occur to them to say they wouldn't come, so I sat down there for an hour, and eventually managed to find a phone number and get in contact and the guy was still there, and he said oh no I'm not coming up. This was like quarter to twelve, he should have been there at eleven o'clock. No he got stuck in London the night before because of the bad weather, and he started saying oh I'm sorry I don't think I'm going to be able to make it. Well I said, I was a bit concerned, I said it would be nice if you could let us know and Especially since you travel er, er, twenty or thirty to get there. Yes, that's right, yes, I mean until you get there. I mean he knew that because he'd contacted me up here and I said well, to make it easier for you we could meet in Middlesbrough, save you coming up from er, Mansfield. I said well, it cuts the, it cuts the journey in half then. I wasn't too happy about that but never mind. Erm, what else, last week I had a meeting with Mike and Yvonne from D T I and Phil. I was looking forward to talk a bit about er, what they're doing er, in the way of seminars and so on this year and how we can tie in with it, and how we're going to erm, actually take over the forum plan for Eurofile. It's typical, they just accepted it all, so it didn't really achieve a great deal, but Mike told me quite a lot of things that I don't really have any idea, or I didn't know about, What achievement of financial business will four year plan, will it make anything else? I can't see that they can afford to be a high profile company? They're going to erm, they're going to give the money towards running a forum, but not a great deal, and then it doesn't even cost that much, it just really a question of erm, mailshots and twice yearly events or whatever. You don't think it'll be once they put the money Yes, so it's, you know, it's like two mailshots up once a quarter or whatever,minutes, and I'm paying for a lunch. you're thinking of direct costs, but erm, Phil was going to ask Jeff if he would chair it, and also if he'd be willing, to be sort of editor in chief, of Eurofile, so that was yesterday, and I haven't seen Phil since, don't know what happened with that and went to him that it was a briefing meeting. yes This individual just about won, in fact it was over by ten past two. Yes, Oh I, yes, I can see here, yes, that's only two It's more than I saw of him. Mhm, Why I'm not sure Walkies But erm, yes, so I still don't know what's happening with that yet, and I'm waiting also for them to confirm a date for this first sort of Do Business in France seminar, that we're going to help them with, which was originally going to be February, and is now going to be March. We think it was going to be the seventh and the eighth and the ninth, and they've told Newcastle City it's the ninth, but she was meant to confirmed last Wednesday, and she's still not. So erm, I've had a word Are export involved in this, I mean it seems quite if they're not? Mm, yes, but the trouble is they're not going to be interested in Europe, so they're not, Western Europe . They don't know how useful it would be but anyway, they said there, there's, it's a slightly odd event because it's actually going to be just in the Civic Centre, and er, and kind of tacking on some workshops and things, so I'm going to help her with workshops and have a display stand and so on but other than that, we've not really got any direct input into it, because it is very much, sort of, you know, this is how you do business in France, these are the financial problems, type of thing. It's just a good workshop,yes Which I was for shying off anyway, because I don't think it's any of our, our business. I'm mean they've got export people that know about that, and E C people one of those things. Yes, that's right, so I said you know, it's on a general level, I said yes, fine. But, er, other people start bringing up sort of problems with the French tax situation on such and such a structure of company or whatever, which is not anything we want to get involved with. So I had a meeting with Dailey to talk about the workshops and so on, so we've bashed out the format and er, and what we think we'd like to do, but it's partly dependent on D T I, because it is their event, and we want to be seen to hijack it. Erm, I had a meeting with Ian and erm,Do , Dorothy. Mhm, and told them that you wouldn't be your present arrangement Erm, yes, quite They took it remarkably well really, but er, I think there needs to be soft There must be have contingency, because Anne'd go up the wall over that. You know, I don't know it was sort of well, have a little bit of a boss at Bill then, as a restraining influence in the past I'm no help either, I did sort of wonder what she'd say but she's. They've been sort of so falsely jolly in the past, it sickens me. Get into Microfit, when you're in the data input menu I'd like you to call up the file Q M four FIT Q M four FIT file file . If you just look at the er the sheet, that we've handed out, they loaded from er from the computer it's that data that's in front of you, right, we've got three, three series, right, it's times data, right, from nineteen twenty three to nineteen forty five, right and the three variables are, textile consumption,United States er real, sorry is benevolence of the U S, so it's textile consumption,capita, real income er per capita income to be adjusted through inflation, so constant money terms and what the relative price of textiles P erm the price of textiles relative to the general level er the general price level. Okay what we're going to be doing is estimating a demand function so we can specify the textile consumption as a function of real incomes per capita and also relative prices, alright. A priori, what sign would we expect on those two variables? Say the income, what sign would you expect to observe? Yeah positive providing textiles are a normal good, you should observe positive er income consumption response okay. How about prices?what code, what sign do we expect on the er the price variable there? Yeah negative, right, textiles rise faster, the price of textiles rises faster than the general price level, the real increase in textile prices, therefore, we'd expect providing the first law of demand holds, that we get a negative response consumption, right. So that's what we expect a priori a positive coefficient, a negative, coefficient, positive on income, negative on prices. What we are actually going to do today is to look using this data, is to look at structural stability, right, we're going to ask ourselves are the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample, are they constant over time. There's no point in estimating a model if in reality those coefficients are not fixed, they're jumping all over the place. Right with those parameters, so if you just look at the er coefficional income, if we estimate the coefficional income to be nought point five right, over the entire sample, the then subsequently find out if that coefficient varies from year to year from minus six plus ten, right, having a one point estimate, right, er oh that coefficient is not going to be particularly useful to us, we want to know er whether our coefficients remain reasonably constant throughout our sample period, particularly if we're using this er equation to make out of sample predictions, right. The first thing we must er be sure of is that the coefficients within the sample are reasonably, er reasonably constant, right. If they are not reasonably constant, then not only is the model er a poor one, right, within sample but it can't really be used for out of sample predictions, because although on average er our coefficient that we estimate it might be nought point five, then the out of sample could well be minus six or something like that. Right, so you need to know that our model is characterized by constant parameters over the sample. Now the data that we've got here has been artificially generated. the last six observations of it has, right, the first six observations, sorry the er the first twenty odd observations are real, right, that they haven't been made up but the last six observations have been made up, right, to er to illustrate structural change. We will assume that we don't know that there is structural change in this data, although a priori, we might expect it. Why, why might we expect structural change to occur in this example? Anything in particular? Okay, yeah, that's right, this s this series a particularly volatile period of economic history in the nineteen thirties, the Great Depression, in addition what's at the end of the series? Yeah the Second World War, right, so er I can tell you now that in actual fact there's no structural change during the thirties here but there is structural change during the war. Textile consumption, or the parameters that we estimate during peacetime no longer er explain textile consumption during wartime. Right, I'm going to go through methods of how we can detect structural change by the non constant parameters. The first thing we'll do is look at the data, alright, so if you go from the action menu into option one, right, we're going to plot er go through to the transform edit option, go into the data processing environment, right, where your three variables are listed T C I P. Right, if you just give the command Plot T C Plot space T C then press the return key right, that's textile consumption over our sample. Now it's not immediately obvious from that time series that there's a structural break, right, textile consumption hasn't fallen dramatically, right, or risen dramatically over the post war period, oh sorry du during the er the war period. Nevertheless we can show that there is significant structural change er in the model that we'll estimate. Right, so by looking at the graph, I am just trying to impress upon you that structural change cannot always be spotted simply by looking at the data right, anyway, let's now move on to estimate our first model. What we are going to be doing is trying to explain that series, right that er consumption series. So if you press the escape key we'll go back to the data processing environment, right. What we're going to do is to log all our variables, right, so if you let L N T C equal open brackets T C close brackets, right, we going to define a new variable L N T C. That's going to be the natural logarithm, right, of our original series T C textile consumption. If you now plot L N T C right, if you plot L N T C you should have a very similar graph to the one that you had before. Alright, logging the data doesn't change the nature of the data, what it does do is that it re-scales the data, okay so the only thing that's, that's, that's changed by logging, right, is the scale of the cr is the vertical scale on the graph, right, but essentially we are still trying to model the same series and N T C is essentially the same series as T C. Okay, so if you press the escape key, once you've had a look at the data, er if you log all the other variables er if you let L N I equal log open brackets I close brackets let L N P equal log open brackets P close brackets, press the return key. Okay has everyone created those three variables in logs? Okay, right what we are going to er do now is create a constant, we'll need a constant for our regressions so if you type the letter Q to come out of the data processing environment right type the letter Q right and then go into the er constant creation menu, which is option one of the data processing menu right,you'll, you'll be asked for a name for if you like call it C or constant or Fred Bloggs, just supply a name to your constant term. By the way has everybody changed erm the password or their password, have you changed it to your date of birth, have you all done that because if you haven't, you've only got six grace log-ins on erm where your password is your user name. If you don't change your password within six er times of logging in then you will be excluded from the network. So you won't be able to log on to Microfit? Right,okay, so has everybody created a constant right, what we are going to do now is to er estimate the first model right equation one on the sheets that you've been given, alright, you've created a constant, we've got our variables L N T C L N I L N P right so if press the letter Q to quit from the data processing environment and press the return key, head towards the action menu, right, when you are in the action menu, go to option two, which is the estimate option, right, and you should then be given a dialog box. If you then specify your equation, so it's L N T C your dependent variable space, whatever the name you called your constant then L N I space L N P. Now just specify the variables that you want in this regression, right, your dependent variable first okay when you've specified the equation, sorry once you specify the equation press the end key which is between the alphabetic and the numeric key pads, that will then submit that request, right. If you then er, it will then ask you over what period do you want to right so if you press the end key that will submit the job erm it asks for the sample period, we're going to use the whole of the sample, so if you just press the return key, that's the default for the whole of the sample, right, it then asks you what procedure you want to use to estimate the model, we're going to use O L S option one, just press the return key O L S then the computer has estimated the model, right. Before we move on, let's just have a look at those numerical estimates, can we look at the coefficients on income, notice that in this model because we've logged both dependent and the independent variables, right, the coefficients that we estimate are elasticities, right, so we can read those coefficients off directly as elasticities and that's the case for any model in which all the variables are logged right, in er, if we didn't log the data, in order to calculate the elasticity we have to multiply a coefficient the computer gives us by a erm price quantity ratio, price less, less part of the income constant ratio to obtain the income elasticities. Alright but in any double logged mode, right, the coefficients you estimate are elasticities, so we look at the incoming elasticity, we get a measure, or we get an estimate point six eight, right, that's a positive as we would expect suggesting that er erm textiles are a normal good, right. Notice that an incoming elasticity is less than unity, and that's less than one, as a result textiles, textile industry in the Netherlands is going to be a declining sector in the economy, right, as incomes er per capita G D P rises, the textile sector will benefit, alright, because, because human demand for textiles either they're demanding proportionately less of any increases in incomes. Right, then so as a result the textiles would be a and relative decline to the rest of the economy. Is that a T ratio on that incoming elasticity? Is that coefficient statistically significant, is it significantly different from zero? Our estimate incoming elasticity, just the T ratio would you say. T ratio of one point four nine. Typically we use the rule of thumb to statistical significance so if we have a T ratio that's less than two we can infer that that coefficient to which the T ratio is attached is not significantly zero. In actual fact our incoming elasticity there with er nought point six is statistically significant zero, eighty five percent confidence level. Confidence right the figure in the square brackets next to the T ratio gives you the significance level of the coefficient, right. We normally use the five percent significance level or the ten percent significance level which corresponds er ninety five percent confidence or ninety percent confidence right. So this T ratio on income elasticity is for the bit right and if we were using the five percent or ten percent as our sort of cut off point, we'd actually discard income from our consumption, from our demand function. Now as economists we should have strong prides about income in this model, we would all, we would expect income to be very important in explaining textile consumption although the model is telling us at the moment, income doesn't seem to be significantly explained in textile consumption so that's something to worry about, we're getting some, er sort of peculiar results here. We now look at the er price unity as a T ratio minus ten, right, so it's highly significant, right and the er figure in square brackets, the probability value next to the T ratio tells you that we get least ninety nine point nine percent confidence coefficiency price elasticity demand significantly different from zero right, now is everybody happy interpreting the coefficient right and the T ratio? If not say now and we can go through it. It is vitally important that you know how to distinguish a statistically significant coefficient, right, rule of thumb is that the T ratio has to be greater than two with absolute value right and the figures in square brackets next to the T ratios tell us the exact level of significance, right, er of that coefficient, right, so the incoming elasticity of demand is statistically significant from zero only at the eighty five percent level, a correspondence of fifteen percent significance that incoming the price elasticity demand, highly significant, right, significance level as given by the probabil by the probability er unit in square brackets, the timing level therefore we could be very highly confident about that coefficient okay. So we've got this model, right, we've estimated the model, let's now have a look at the plot of actual and predicted. So if you press the return key right, we just get a whole list of diagnostic test statistics that we won't look at at the moment, press the return key again, come to the post regression menu, you go into option three which is a list plot option. Now the plot actual and fitted, right, so we try to explain the actual block of textile consumption as the blue line and to do that we are using our model with those fixed estimates, the incoming elasticity and the price elasticity. As you can see there, the model is breaking down during the latter period of our sample. The notice that appears to track the data quite well up until about nineteen thirty, right and then after nineteen thirty it seems to get progressively worse. Now we may suggest that that's the effect of the Second World War biasing alright biasing the estimates that we've just produced from the whole sample. Now because I'll leave that for a moment right, so one way we may test the structural change, right, is to construct what's called a dummy variable and a dummy variables in a wide variety of applications they can be used to er get rid of er outlying observations, very very high or very very low observations. They can also be used for tests for structural change, right, what we're going to do is to say during peacetime right, we'll estimate our model, we'll then estimate our model during wartime and we're going to assume that the coefficients or the income and price elasticity mark, don't change during between peace and wartime, all that happens is as they intercept this model shifts, right, now you may thinks that's not particularly er attractive, you might expect the price of income elasticities to change between two periods and we could actually use dummy variables to see whether that is the case, right, however, we'll get very similar results, right, if you just use a slope dummy so it'd intercept dummy, right, and all that's going to do is to say, well the model runs like this in peacetime, right, and then wartime it suddenly shifts up or down depending on the effect of er of the war on textile consumption. Right, so what we're going to do is create a dummy variable to test that hypothesis, right, so if you press the escape key, right, and work your way back towards erm the data processing sort of environment, so go back to the post regression menu through the backtracking menu erm, when you're in the backtracking menu, go to option six, which is the process plot edit option right, now press the return key in the data processing menu, right, and that will get you to the data processing environment when we can start messing about with our variables. Right, what we are going to do now is create a dummy variable, right, let's call it D one right so if you type D one equals zero and press the return key what you created there, right, is a new variable called D one and it assumes the value of zero, right, what I want you to do now is to edit this variable, so type edit space D one press the return key right, if you type on edit space D one you'll then get a sheet that has all the observations for our variable D one. Using the cursor key move down to nineteen, the observation for nineteen forty right when you've done that type the letter one and then press the return key, right, and you'll see that the observation is changed, right, from zero to one. Move the cursor to nineteen forty one, right, and then press one again, press return key. Just go through the remainder of the, of the observations, so that you should have zeros up until nineteen forty and then at nineteen forty through to nineteen forty five, right, you have ones. When you've finished doing that, press the end key. Right the end key will save the edit that you've just made okay. Right, what we're now going to do is incorporate that dummy variable as the regressor in our model as an explanatory variable, so what's going to happen is that that dummy variable is turned off, alright in the first part of the sample right up until the war that dummy variable's going to be off, right so it has a value of zero, right, then in nineteen forty through to nineteen forty five it's switched on and what it's going to do is to pick up any differential effects, right, in the intercept between wartime and peacetime right, we'll talk a little bit more, more about that in a second, we're going to add it in as a regressor, right, because it only comes on during the wartime it will pick up any shift in the intercept, right, that occurs due to the war if there is one, of course there may not be but it's quite likely that there, there may well be, so if you type Q to come out of the data processing environment, go back to the action menu and test estimate forecast okay at the dialog box just add D one to your list of explanatory variables, alright then press the end key, right, yeah we're gonna use the full sample right, we gonna use O L S, right you have now estimated the model with this dummy variable now just to see what's happened to those coefficients the er incoming elasticity was at nought point six is now doubled right to one point one four more importantly, right, its T ratio has jumped from one point eight five right to six point eight, as a result, we now say that the incoming elasticity, the income coefficients, right, the significant zero, it's important to explain the textiles as such the er, we are now getting a very different estimate for our our estimate for price elasticity is four and one to nought point eight minus one is one point eight, notice though that its ratio has jumped considerably or has doubled and the dummy variable itself is very significant the T ratio ten the coefficient on that dummy variable tells us the effect of the war on textile consumption, right so on average textile consumption rose by point two er see what the units of measurement are we don't actually have units of er ah so we'll elasticity whatever it's multiplied by That's right if you er so this point two quantifies the effect of the war on our equation, and where is the so the intercept, well what you're saying is in peacetime the intercept is equation three point one seven, however, in war time the intercept shifts up and is now three point one seven plus point two, You could draw it like that you could say that this is the the war which cuts in this time of year line shifts up, Yes. so if you wanted it back, you would actually get a new value for the intercept which increases by nought point two three point Three point one okay so this is where the model, in effect what we've done which is a very crude way, right, of erm incorporating exogamous influences, right, we haven't said tha that the war is going to affect the income or price elasticity what we did do, right, all that we're doing is that we're allowing the intercept of our model to change, right, now as a result, we've got, we can prove the st the statistical significance of all the variables in our model, right, the co the actual coefficients that we've estimated have changed quite significant, particularly in the er the incoming elasticity, right, the incoming elasticity was less than one, right, and insignificance before was now greater than one and height of R squared has also increased dramatically our measure of explanatory power. Now if you just press the return key a couple of times right, and have a lot of actual and fitted, if you go into option three in the data post depression menu you will notice that the fit of our model is very very different right, so we are now getting a very very good correspondence between actual and fitted, notice that in our original model the thing started to break down at about nineteen thirty, right, just by allowing the intercept to vary, right, over the wartime we've now got a much better fit throughout the whole period why is that the case? Why are we now getting a much better fit throughout the entire period simply by incorporating the dummy variable to the war period? Any suggestions? Well what's happening is it the, during the war, right, we're constraining the computer to estimate, like a single coefficient that is applicable to both war and peacetime er isn't the case, right,th there is a structural change, right, so when th when we constrain the computer to estimate the coefficients throughout the whole period, right, the coefficients are biased but if they don't apply either to the post er pre war peacetime sample neither do they er fit very well to the data during the wartime, right, if we allow the intercept to change but we're getting much better estimates both wartime and peacetime er parameter's okay because we haven't got rid of, we've got rid of that bias, right, in constraining the parameters to fit both wartime and peacetime er time periods. Okay, erm on this sheet, I don't think, well we won't go through it now because we've run out of time. On this sheet, on page two, we've er, we've performed equation two, right, on the sheet and the second page and it says that there's, there are two alternative ways of testing for structural change using dummy variables. One is to include corporate dummy variable of the intercept and see whether it's T ratio or significantly different, is, sorry it's greater than two right or we can use an F test, right, now that F test that's given me that formula in the middle of the page is a very important test which was developed by a chap called Chow and as a result it become known as the Chow test and it's a, it's a test for parameter constancy, er do we have constant parameters in our model now it tells you how to compute this Chow test, in this particular case we're only dummying the intercept, the Chow test gives exactly the same results of T tests, right, erm we won't bother going through it, if you want to go through this er sheet in your own time calculate that, that Chow test and essentially what it involves is splitting with the s the whole sample now into two sub-samples, right, the first sub-sample, right, is peacetime, the second sub-sample wartime, right, and you just compare the residual sum of the squares on the unaccounted for variation, right, between actual and fitted values, just compare the residual sum of squares between these two sub periods, right and if you use the formula that's given there that will come out with exactly the same result, well in actual fact you can square, if you square the F statistic you get calculating one formula you will get T value, got from er the computer right, the er, the sheet goes on to say how we can er use dummy variables in slightly more complicated ways, right, we could see actually see whether the income or price elasticities of demand changed. Right, instead of letting the intercept change we could just let er our elasticities change. Anyway that's preferable because that's actually what's, what's happening, right, the war is likely to affect the elasticities of demand rather than this er bizarre concept intercept erm and the, the sheet on page three tells you how, how to do that okay. But essentially all these tests do the same thing because they're seeing whether the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample are robust over all sub-samples, right, we can't, we wouldn't bother testing over all sub-samples though we can do, it's just if we have good reason to believe that behaviour in one sub-sample different for behaviour in another E G use er Chow test or equivalently a dummy variable on the intercept to see whether there was any change. Right, okay we'll leave it there, if you just press the escape key and then work your way out of Microfit towards the action menu, exit from Microfit and don't forget to log out of the network. Okay, feel free to come down here at any time with this sheet and er going through the, the examples in greater detail Q M four FIT was the data file, you'll always be able to access, right when you've logged out of the network feel free to go and a merry Christmas, see you next year. It wouldn't be any bother to me, if you Mm. Wanted me to. Well we'll do that, I see what see says any rate on Monday. But I don't think we should give her too long, cos she's got herself into . Mm . Yes . Yes . Keep putting up, we've had her for about two years haven't we? Yes, she did say last time one of her friends would like the job. Oh god. Oh no, no. She's told them how easy it is. She's told them what to do, birds of a feather. Yeah,. Rose would you consider a man, I've got an idea there might still be a possibility of Mr Well I don't see why not, if he, if he did . Some men are very good . Mm. Some men are very good, we've got a good one at the church hall pub next door, I mean. Mm. Toilets and things there. That's right. Yes, I mean that would be very good . I think . I'll have words with Sharon on Monday and er, oh I can't, yes I can on Monday I'm having my hair cut later, but I can come up about nine o'clock and see if she's here. I bet she won't be. No, I bet. She'll be in the penny farthing then. Well, I will then have to ring her won't I? Mm. So will you all get round to your limerick's please ladies. . Thank you all very much. Thank you. Elsie, oh. All right sit please. I've checked your books and I have to say that I'm very pleased. Worked very well most of you erm Rachael you weren't here last week were you? What five S, this is five S five you were over there. Er . Oh well it doesn't matter. We've got . . Yeah . I'll explain later. So this this is five S? Yes. Right. Mrs . Okay . Right if I can give Ken those to give out. Erm and while Ken's giving them out let's try and remind ourselves what we talked about last week. The rule is I ask and you put your hand up. What did we talk about last week? Chris. The universe. The universe. What is the universe? Louise. Er the universe is er planets. Is it? Is that all it is? No hand up. Jennifer. The universe is everything. Everything absolutely everything. How big is the universe? Phillip. No one knows. Nobody knows. What's that word, who was that put that word up that was it you Phillip? Er what was that word you you used last week? Infinitive. Infinitive. The universe is infinite we don't know. When we look out of the window at night what do we see? Jody. Stars. Stars. What are those stars? Suns. Suns. Not all of them most of them are. Some of them are? Alan. Planets. Planets. How many stars are there? Come on everybody's hand should be up, how many stars are there? It's that word again isn't it? Infinitive. We can't count them because if we could count all the ones that we could see there's still plenty beyond those. What's the nearest star to us. What's the nearest one? Louise. Is it the sun? The sun. The sun. Our sun. Well why can't we see stars during the day. If we look out at the sky why can't we see stars during the day? Steven. It's too light. It's too light and where's that light coming from? The sun. The sun. Our star is too bright for us to see stars from further away. Do you know why we can see them at night and not at day time. Why is the sun bright during the day time? Does it switch off at night? That's what we've got to go on to. I'm just wondering how much you know already. Kieran. The earth turn round . The earth turns round so we're in a shadow. Host stars will have what going round them? The moon. Not the moon no. Phillip. . Try. You're doing really well. Planets. Planets. How many planets has our sun got that we know about because there might be some we don't know. Lee. Nine. Nine. Nine that we know about. Which one are we? What's the name of our planet? Katrina. Earth. Earth. How where do we come in the order of nine? Are we furthest away, nearest, in the middle?. Third. Third. And you wouldn't remember just how far away we are would you? You, come on. One hundred and fifty million kilometres. A hundred and fifty million kilo kilometres. I think you deserve a house point there. What house are you in? . . Oh go on then. Hundred and fifty million kilometres from the sun. And what does the sun do for us? Er gives us energy. Gives us energy. What sort of energy? Sun light and . Light. Katrina. Warmth. And warmth and without those we can't live. Light and warmth. Without the light plants couldn't live and without plants we couldn't live. Do you think we could live on another of the planets then? What's the one nearest the sun can anyone remember? Stacey. Mercury. Mercury. What would it mean being nearer the sun? What would it mean about that planet compared with earth? We wouldn't be able to live. Why? It would be too hot. Oh lovely and warm a nice sun tan. No? . Er it's, what are you saying? I mean are we talking it's a lot hotter, too hot. What would happen to us? We could die. We . All right so we can't go that way it's too hot. What's the next one to Mercury? Venus. Venus. Venus. That's about the same size as earth you know. Mercury's very small but Venus is is roughly like us. How about that one then. Could we live on Venus? Do you think? No. No, why not? Because we're we're in the exact spot where we've got enough warmth and Exactly. That's a good point. We're here because we're suited to being here. If we sh wanted other conditions we'd live on a different planet or we would have developed on a different plant. We have to be exactly where we are. Earth's just the right place. Let's just see how smart you really are then. You've done Mercury which is nearest before. You've done Venus, what comes next? Er there are some hands that aren't up. Come on what comes next, what's number three? Number three in charts for the last million million years Michael. Mars. You've missed one out. Oh sit down. You're life doesn't depend on being asked to answer this question because you know the answer. Oh I'm going to ask somebody who hasn't got their hand up. Kendal. Earth. Earth exactly. Right Mercury, what comes next I've forgotten? Erm mars. Steven. Venus. Venus. This is? Come on Jenny. Earth. Earth. Now Michael. Mars. Mars and we don't know any moons do we? Yes. Er d'ya mind, I'm the teacher. If I say you don't know you don't know. You don't know, Lee. You don't know what comes next, you don't. What is it? Jupiter. Is it? Yeah. We wrote it down in our book last week. All right. Erm what comes after Jupiter then? Look at them all looking through their books for goodness sake. Lee. Saturn. Saturn. What comes after Saturn. Uranus. Uranus. Neptune. Neptune. Pluto. Pluto . That's fairly straight forward then. Yes Mr . Yes Mr . Kieran says we're on earth we belong here this is the perfect place for us. Jennifer how far are we from the sun? One hundred and fifty million kimome Kimometres. Kimometres Kilometres. Yes and I'm gonna give you this sheet which it's to save time for drawing it. This is where you now need to concentrate. What we've done so far is dead easy. Because it's not as simple as it looks on this sheet. What's at the centre of our universe? Not our universe our solar system sorry. Kieran. The sun. The sun. Our sun our star. Is there somebody sit there going ? Think, does it? No. No it doesn't. What does the sun do? Gives us light and . It does but that's because it's like a huge atom bomb flowing hydrogen all the time. It moves around in space, it's moving all the time. All those stars are moving. Not quickly as far as we can see. Don't get upset you're not going to disappear one night. All right concentrate. The sun is moving, it's also turning, spinning, like a ball spinning on your finger. What are the planets doing? Revolving . They are spin not all of them. Not all of them. Now that's a little thing you might want to check if you've got an atlas at home. Some of them don't revolve don't spin in their axis. Earth does. What else are they doing, apart from those that spin? Yes. Moving. Moving. And they're moving around the sun. What do we call the path that they follow? When something's going round something else, do you know the word? Oh no. Try it. Solar. No that's that's to do with the sun. That's what we talked about last time yes. But if you know it. What about space craft? Space craft goes up and when it gets to a certain height above the earth it just goes round and round and round. What do we say it's doing, what what is it in? Come on star trek, when he parks his star ship what does he say? We're in? Space. Well yes you're in space. Pardon? Well hardly ever our watch. Orbit. Orbit. They're in orbit. Orbit means you go round and round and round and round and round. Because you're held there by all these planets and stars pulling at you. And that's what holds these planets. The sun has its own gravity. Do you remember me mentioning that? And it's trying to pull the planets in, Lee, but other stars are pulling them and stopping them falling into the sun. All different distances away from the sun and there's Jennifer's a hundred and fifty million millimetres. All going round in, what's the word again? Orbit. Orbit. In fact this a this isn't quite accurate. Because the orbit isn't round isn't a circle, it's an ellipse, it's more like that. All right? And while you've got the planet orbiting the sun there are things that orbit the plant. What d'ya call something that goes round and round a planet? Think you've all seen them. At least one regularly. When you look at night you see? Lee. Stars. But they're not ones that are orbiting the planet. Katrina. Moon. Moon. Moon orbit the planet. Here it tells you how many moons each planet's got. Earth has one you know that. Jupiter which is a huge planet, if you look carefully here this is a this is to scale, this shows you the size of the planet. So this size of Jupiter compared with earth. You see, there's Venus which is about the same size, Mercury's a small one, Saturn is huge, Uranus, Neptune they're big ones and Pluto's another one about the same size as earth. So that's not quite accurate either. This is just to give you the order and the distance. And Jupiter has twelve moons. Some of the moons of Jupiter are enormous. These are all orbiting Jupiter as Jupiter orbits the sun. Right. Would you give one of those out. We we won't do anything with it yet. We need now to open our books. Rule off from where you were before I want you to get some information down about our solar system. More or less what we've just talked about. Because it's still only the second week with me I think get the information down and we'll do what we did last week. Do you remember what we did last week? We did it all together. And by the way I'm very pleased to see that some of you actually wrote it completely in your own words didn't you. Either that or I can't read your writing properly. That's very good. As you get the facts right. We finished off with giving a list of the planets haven't we? We've talked about the sun a little bit, we just have done. We started to talk about the solar system. How far have we got on the solar system Josephine? Naming the planets? Mm. We need to do a bit about the sun spinning and moving through space don't we? We've not got that down have we. So put today's date. What happened to the one that you had did you give it back in? Have you got a ruler? So can somebody give me a sentence that explains what we talked about the sun isn't staying still it's, all right Kieran. The sun's in the middle of the galaxy that Well it's you can't say in the middle of the galaxy, it's only in the middle of the galaxy as we look at it. Er let's be absolutely scientific. Erm all we need to say is the sun isn't still, what can we say. Go on Louise. Is it moving? The sun moves through space yes. And while it's moving through space what is it doing, what did we say. Steven. Is erm it spins. Spins good. What shall we say spins or rotates. I think spins is best. Quick the sun. So what did we say. Louise said you said that you said? It's moving. The sun moves through space and Steven we decided on spins. Spins. Just to make sure that erm usually at weekends you know Ooh! Excuse me . I listen to them. Yeah. Will you have this music played at your funeral? ! Oh God ! Mm? No I don't think so. Erm , I need that one there. You sound like a copper. That one there. A what? He sounds like a copper doesn't he? A copper. Aye. Jean, you know what the answer is don't you? I don't know. I don't care, I'm not there . Yeah. Well done. Well done. Lots of informa , I know it's not re , I know we haven't talked about selling T N T, and I'll, your questions aren't really about this time, I'll do that in a minute. What questions can we ask about T N T, to T N T potential customers? We asked about music, we asked about food, we asked about holidays, we asked family, we asked about, what was Ja , Mandy's questions to you Jane? What was your Driving. question? Driving. Driving. We asked about, what was your question to Music. music. Er, er clothes to Danny. What questions do you want to know from customers about, what d'ya wanna know about them? Their business. About their business. What about their business Justin? What is the question that you want answered? Do they send goods out? Do they want a carrier? Do you use a carrier? Right. How regular? Can we assume that something moves out of most buildings? Yep. Yeah. Yeah, we can. What sort of things move out of any business premises. Papers Letters. or letters. Documents. That's right. Something's likely to move. So yo , rather , do they send goods out? Can we assume that one anyway Ju , maybe not goods Well I su but there's, something moves that needs a delivery Mm mm. somewhere. Would you, would,wo , I mean, just the way, what made you feel that it wouldn't be the case? But would you mean Well er , well I've, and added two hundred mailers Mhm. in like two days and Yeah. that's the fir , and you ring up hairdressers and Mm. vets and all sorts Mm. so you had to ask them. Mm. A couple Some people just have, some people will will never have a need for a carrying service. Yeah. No, there is some Are you, sort of Okay, you were talking about, you you're talking about your target customers were sort of like abattoirs and hairdressers and stuff like that? Yeah but you know the mailers that we did, I mean Right. that that They were just registered businesses. we were told to ask Right. you know Okay. do you ever have a need for a carrier Yeah. at all? You know before you start giving them all the spiel What type of question is that though? Do you ever have a need Closed. for a carrier? It's closed. Yeah. Cold. It's, still a You have to open. How can you ask to that? Yeah, you could say that. Well there's, they need to know a little bit about you. So you said, you know, good morning, my name's Kath . I'm a, the business repre , I'm, I represent th er, T N T super mail, I er, am responsible for business development here you've recently received er erm, a some information from our company, am I right? Yes. Yes. Or I know you've recently received some information, that's good. I can see that you are a hairdresser now what question do you wanna ask? Would you ever need How often do you have a use for a parcel carrier? How often would you ever send, or something into your company, or have something sent out especially, by perhaps a customer request? So you need to know how often, right? Assume something goes. I guarantee something'll go. It might be once in Yeah. bloody blue moon and you may not be worth putting on your and calling every six weeks Mandy, but, it might be worth asking it in a more open way. Because Sod's law'll say if you ask it open, you'll find summat out you never assumed. Mm. Yo you know. You never thought. Well actually, yes we're the head office for a regional group here and as well as have a, er an actual service for hairdressing we also have a distribution er control shop at the back. And, we have our own delivery service to our cu , to our own network. Now what's the question you can ask this hairdresser that got his own bus , I know I'm using a, a an extreme Mm mm. point, they've got their own delivery service. What else would you like to ask? Is there any place you can ever not go to? What areas does it, do they tend to serve? What happens if give me an scenario, a cautionary tale like the insurance man does to his customers. You sell God forbid God forbid? God forbid that you should ever lose parcel and Mrs on Newcastle hasn't got a wig base any more your reputation's going to be in tatters, isn't it?

Cos th I remember the first time I went down that way over the bridge. It was about a hundred and eighty miles I clocked up. Er but coming back I only clocked up about a hundred and twenty. What was the mileage when we got there? A hundred and eleven? Something like that, yeah. So it was three hundred coming back or total three hundred. I can't remember now exactly. I I think it does make a difference, going over the bridge. I I found it when I was driving the last time. But I couldn't remember where the turn off was to come up the scenic route. Cos I was reading, and you'd passed it. Yeah well you could erm go up, go down the M 50 into Ross and then go from there.

Mm we oh yeah Andy's Nigerian. The Nigerian. Mm. Yeah. Except for him of course, but Cos I was getting a bit upset that my voice was going a bit Brummie. Oh right. I've given her her hairdryer back on trial, I've told her. If she leaves it plugged in and switched on again she won't get it back. Yeah. She's definitely unplugged the hairdryer and she's unplugged her radio as well. Because it ain't on. I ain't having the house burnt down. Bloody hairdryers. Well want to know if Rick joins in the conversation will we get any vouchers for doggy food? Yeah, we do don't we? Yeah we do. You are cheeky. What about her food? Tell Mary. Tell Mary all about it. I don't want to know about it Rick. Well who, who noticed that you had the least Brummie accent? The instructors Oh. and all the other lads. Oh right. Did they record it or that, no? Which is a good job. Mm. Cos most of us were petrified anyway. And that's a bit like that erm the teaching skills that I had to do that time when I was on the course. Mm? Erm and I had to think up something that I do as a hobby er to teach other people. I, I did those little flowers you see and took them in. And er it is quite nervewracking really to sit there. Specially when the instructors come over and they're sort of sitting watching as well. Well the bad thing was, as soon as I picked my cards up I dropped them all you know? Mm. All your flash cards? Good morning yeah. Good morning ladies and gentlemen pshoow and they, they went all over the place. So I had to pick them back up mm sorry. Bit of nerves. Be back to front now, this morning yeah? John wants me to er sew his trousers for him. Oh. I'm waiting on him picking up the machine. It tickles me the way they call it portable and you can hardly lift it. we took Patricia in to, we give her a lift as far as Longbridge today. She was going back to get her coat changed. And then she was going to the careers office. And erm they were going to send her for an interview straight away. I told her to be home reasonably early but she's not home yet. Well not far I know. Don't let it beat you. I dunno mum. Only a little omelette. Yeah but it was bigger than the plate. You had to fold it in half to get it on. That's what I said to John I said you've got your dinner in between an omelette. Yeah. That's right. I thought I could call it erm a Spanish omelette. What I tried to do was one of those Did you have ploughman's things. did you have a surplus of eggs or something? Pardon me. Well erm, I knew you wouldn't eat sort of sliced ham on its own with erm vegetables. So I knew you would eat it like that in an omelette. Mm. I mean, if it had of been smaller. Well, I'll have a go but I may not eat all this but if it was smaller it's really tasty as well. Mm. But you liked those erm were they countryman's or ploughman's in a packet and you just throw them into the pan and cook it for about fifteen minutes? And that was just potatoes and eggs wasn't it? And some cheese. And bacon. Don't remember. Oh. What I want to do, I want to cut the shopping down as much as I possibly can. Well I think eight pounds is a good start. But when I go to the shops and I spend seventy pound for a week. We have to keep making trips back to the shop because we need bread or milk or something else that we've forgotten. So so just make little trips. So we're just making little trips as we run out of stuff. Mm. Good idea. And see how, if that will work out any better. Yeah. Well the good news for the environmentalists is the bike runs on unleaded. Mhm. Which is good news. Cos like that's not so expensive. So, I shall have to take it to the petrol station in a minute. Yeah. Does, and does it need erm oil or anything like that? No. He showed me where the little oil level was. So you don't have a dipstick, there's a little little ho glass hole Mhm. where you look in. Oh right. With a a maximum and a minimum. Mhm. Like on your dipstick. And you just look at it. Mm. Mm. Well, just be careful when you go out. Yeah. Cos I mean it's it's not the bikers it's the other vehicle that's on the road. Alright? Not more than two minutes. John will verify this. Do you remember John? We came out of the shop, turned left turned left there, and then turned right. We're going down this road and John was in front of me and just as John went past this wagon it pulled out and there was a car coming the other way. Eeeeh hit my horn. Ha I could have shouted louder. And he stopped and luckily there was just enough room for me to slow down and just go between them. I mean that guy just pulled out in front of me. Mm. Huge, huge lorry. Oh he he didn't see you or just didn't ? Didn't care. Oh. He saw me alright cos like John said I had the headlights on. Yeah. Well that's it. Don't expect anybody else to obey the highway code. Yeah. Right? Did you see them two dirty great big no right turn signs? What no right turn signs ? You what? I said to the bloke I said how do you get out that junction? He said you don't, there's no right turn. I looked up the road and there was two great big signs, no right turn. I'd already gone that way twice. Yeah. And turned right. Yeah. Cos it's a very awkward junction. Mm. Thank you mum. Dog's looking at you. What do you want Ricksy? Come on then. What is it Ricky? Come on then.. dog. I don't see any I don't I don't see any bacon in there. You're not having bacon till Monday. Are you gonna buy it tomorrow? No. Oh. You're working, so you don't need bacon. I'm not working Monday.

But we talk about this and we said we're cutting the shopping down, I'm not going shopping. And the first thing you do is demand that we have butter in the house. So we had to go and do shopping just to get your butter. No you didn't. You bought dog food. You bought milk. Yeah I didn't I didn't actually need to go shopping or I didn't want to go shopping. You did. You needed butter. No. You needed butter. There's margarine. Alright. Don't you eat it. Don't you touch that butter. Right. I won't. Nor anybody else. If you're saying you're buying the butter solely for me, then I just want me solely to eat it. Cos I'm not carrying the can. I needed butter as well. Brian, you're not to eat it. What! Not even on my toast at night? No. She says you had to go out and buy butter solely because I wanted it. And I've Oh I've had the bollocking cos we've had to buy butter. Well I wanted it as well so that's two against one. And if you see her, see her eating our butter there will be a row. Cos you've said that. I won't have Flora on the toast. I think that's horrible. It goes all watery. Look I'm not amused at all. Well neither am I. na na na na na He said he wants butter. Yeah. Well why couldn't you put up with margarine for one day? Oh we could have.

I suppose it can be quite entertaining sometimes. Mm. Wait till Trish gets in. Then it will liven up. It's sure to. Er I I suppose it's to see how people use the English language. What words we use, what words aren't used. What slang we use. We use all the words of the English language don't we? We use the yellow ones, the blue ones, the black ones. I wonder how they'd get on with somebody with foreign? George is, George is gonna get me some lights for on here, did you know? Who? George. He's gonna get me glass? No, lights. Oh lights. George ? Yeah. Mm. He makes them. Well Lynwood do them. Oh? So the next time he goes he's gonna get some for me. Oh does George work for the Lynwood?

But we're not spending any money. Yeah. I think Jean said, well she watched the others do it. They only did like erm a square foot every time. Erm you have to do, put it on and then design it. And then move over to the next square. Put it on, design it she said because it dries very quickly. Mm. It's only like a plaster of paris stuff isn't it? It does go off quick. Mm that's right. Quick. She said it's er about ten pound a tub but I don't know how far a tub would go? Not very far. Mm. And then she said there was stuff called textured paint that has, it's like paint with lumps in it. I think it's just lumpy paint gone wrong and then and they sell it. But then she said you get erm you put it on and you get a brush and er not a brush, a roller. And the roller has a design, a line on it. Different designs. That's right yeah. And then you just roll it on. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Said Debbie's used that in her house. It could definitely do with something. But we'll leave it for now. Mm. When, when he was in I saw he I saw Mark look at that corner. Mm. And he copped off. That one there? Yeah. It's skew-wiff. What does it come out does it? Goes in. Ah so I see, yes. Goes in about an inch. Mm. Mm. He was saying to me it was very difficult to do. Well I can't understand why. I mean really what he should have done if it, if it was that difficult he should have gone back another half a brick and the j bricked it up all the way Mm. level, instead of putting bits and pieces in. Surely Yeah. he could have half bricked it all the way up? Mm. Instead of saying how difficult it was putting bits and pieces in. I would have thought that's what I would have done. You know, just come straight up with a row of bricks. Logical thing to do. Yeah. That's what I thought. I mean it didn't have to be spot on. As long as it came back out to where it is now. Ah. Good boy. The dog was lying there last night and Patricia said something to him, I don't know what she said to him but the look on his face. You could tell it really upset him, whatever she said to him. Yeah. She she wouldn't tell us what she'd said to him either, so it must have been bad. But did you fart? He probably farted.

Nobody can. Nobody can tell that I'm Irish. Only when I swear. And you know I don't swear very often. No. Erm kids anyway. But that could change when Patricia comes in.

No. And th th they haven't got a twang as far as I know anyway so Mm. I'm only putting the truth down as I see it. Yeah. You know? I mean I could be wrong. I can only put down what I know to be the truth as far as I can tell. Mhm. There doesn't seem to be a regional accent in this area does there? If you start going further towards Worcester, Worcestershire. Into Worcester The black country. That area. that that area. Well, into Hailsowen Wales. Mhm. places like that, then you would get an accent. I suppose it's too much of a mixture up here isn't it? Mhm. But I don't look at Birmingham people Who? The girl next door. when Brian ? Thought he'd be but he wasn't. kids . Out. You'd better eat that food. I've seen you know the, the coat she brought home first of all?

You what? You know the white arrows in the road? The white the white lines Mhm. and manhole covers. You've gotta find out where they are. What about them? Yeah. I've gotta memorize where they are from now on. Why? The white lines and the arrows in the middle of the lane. Why? They make you change your line. Because I went over it Mm and skidded? doing about sixty and I felt a twitch in the wheel and I thought shit! I'm not going over one of them again. Mm. Well you have to sometimes. You'll get used to it and it doesn't affect you I suppose it a bit? after a bit. But you've got to watch them when they're, when you're in the wet. I was I was, I was slightly banked at the time. Mm. Just very slightly. You w if your d wheel does move it won't move far. You get used to that, the wheel moving over a bit. I suppose er it's a trick not to over correct? It will stop itself. It will, it just might slide a bit but it will stop sliding when it comes off it. Yeah. Cos by the time you you've felt it you've passed it maybe? Well you you've travelled another hundred yards. Yeah. I er I suppose you have to be very careful er and find out what is on the road? But like tomorrow when I go to work Keep away from the kerbs. That's the most important thing. Yeah. I ride in the middle of the lane. Tomorrow when I go to work on it, I'm going through er I'm not gonna go through Bowgreen I don't wanna go that way. go that way . Well you can go straight up to Longridge Lane. I'll go straight through Longridge Lane. That way. Yeah.

Get used to carrying it. Mm? Get used to carrying it. It it didn't bother me at all. I'm not kidding you, it did I didn't feel it. I could feel a slight pressure on me shoulders, but it didn't restrict my movements in any way. When? When I was c coming back with the boots in them. In it. On Saturday. Mm. Well, just be very careful. And don't get over cocky. And keep away from big lorries. Yes mum. I fully intend to keep away from them anyway. I mean a bit of fear is a good thing. Erm, I'm still scared every time I pull away. You know,ji little jitterbugs. Yeah. And I went up Iver Road as well. On a bike? O o on the way back from Andrew's, yeah. I always found that awkward at the top. Yeah. Specially if there was cars on the hill and I had to pull up behind them. Cos you you run out of you know, what things to do. Cos you've gotta have one foot on the ground and you've gotta have one o ha foot, one on the brake Yeah. one on the clutch, one on the throttle Yeah. and the other one on, and your gear change. You're one missing. Yeah . Yeah you I'd just get off and push it . On Iver Road? Whoa! Down he goes. But luckily there was only a c only one car stopped at the top. So I just stopped dead and did a hill start. Stopped at the top and did another hill start. Plymouth Road's another awkward one. The first, the first down bit when you're going down Plymouth Road. Oh yeah, I bet. When you come to the right, the bend. Cos it's actually quite s , quite sharp bend. And it gets wet down there as well. It gets a bit slippy on there. And there's manhole covers as you come out the bend. And don't go don't go speeding Brian. You don't have the same control over a bike when you're speeding.

That's neither here nor there. Oh no and it's gone now. I mean you, the other one's gonna be taxed for Twelve months, yeah. twelve months so it's as long as it's broad John. I suppose I suppose we could get rid of the erm all these pay slips now couldn't we? Yeah. I think so. I'll go and get er a black bag for rubbish. Oh my god! Hey well why don't you sell them at the car boot sale? Well I mean they're only part sets. They aren't actually worth a lot of money. Are they? No but I mean you'd gi maybe give somebody a bit of pleasure sorting them out. Yeah. and write on it er car boot sale. We're gonna burn all these? This is rubbish. These want burning don't they? Do they? Yeah. I'll burn them. Wh why do they want burning? Well I don't like things like this flying around. The old pay slips and things. So I I'll burn them. I'll burn all this. Where will we burn them? I'll burn them in the garden. On the top patio. Have a little fire going. I wouldn't bother so much John. Yeah, I I would. That rubbish? Rubbish. That's it. That's the rubbish on the . No, these are all foreign coins. You can't get rid of these. Will they go to the boot sale? No. No I'll keep them. What's that? Rubbish. Well what's the difference between throwing this one out and throwing them out and burning them? We'll keep the coins. What did you say? I'll keep the coins. Oh right. This box is going back into the cupboard with the things that you want to keep. Oh, right. Okay? Well all this, all this is good. I want to keep. Everything in there's gonna be kept. Right. Is this your adaptor? I found it in here. Yeah I know I fou seen it the other day Mary. Car boot? No. That's I want, don't don't chuck old and ancient things away that might be worth a lot of money later on. I mean that's a rare thing. What's that? That one? Is that yours? Yeah. For car boot sale. Eh? Car boot sale that one. On the tray. Yeah. What's that? That's a screwdriver set. It's erm it's a carving set. Car boot sale. Car boot? It cost us a fortune in . Yeah. Car to being an enlightened voter. Again I'll come back to this point about motivation because it's very important later on. So erm this is Mill's counter-motivation. He also realizes that there are certain threats or problems with democracy. Some of these we've considered before but I'll tell you how Mill feels on them. One of them, this is not the first in the but one of them is that democracy may well throw up unworthy rulers. This is the point erm, well Plato made the point that the people we most want to rule us are probably the ones that are the least likely to want to take on that duty and Ben Williams made the same point the other way round that the people who rise to the top in politics are likely to be the ones that we would least like to have governing us. So I think I made this point before that the people who are right at the top of politics are the ones who are very good at flattery, duplicity, manipulation and so on and these, are these really the qualities we want in our government? So, Mill thinks we need erm Thanks. Mill thinks we need certain safeguards to make sure that unworthy rulers don't present themselves. One thing he says which is erm a current topic is that we should limit the election expenses of any candidate. His thought is that how can we trust anyone who's prepared to pay their own money to get elected? If someone is going to put off a lot of their own money in order to get into parliament, we can, then we can hardly trust them to look to the general interests once they're there, they'll want a return on their investment of some sorts. So anyone who's putting up a lot of their own money is untrustworthy and there should be limitation on how much people can stand, erm Mill actually goes into some figures at this point and rather quaintly says erm either fifty pounds or a hundred pounds ought to be adequate and I don't know what that translates to now. Erm, so there should be a limitation of election expenses. In fact makes the claim that election expenses ought to be met from the public purse rather than the private purse of the candidates tax revenues and I should think Mill would be happy with that idea. Although erm his second idea second way of limiting the possibilities on is rather more difficult to accept now and his claim is that we shouldn't pay members of parliament, that people who go to parliament ought to be doing it out of duty and not out of er interest. What he says is that erm you know when he was writing of six hundred and fifty eight seats in parliament, I don't know how many there are now, but he says if we allowed for people to be paid, then we have as it were six hundred and fifty eight prizes to people's six hundred and fifty eight jobs for people and he says and this is rather astonishing to hear, to read this is that it will attract adventurism of low class to er parliament if we pay members of parliament. Well what about those people who are morally worthy, I take it when he says low class, he doesn't mean low moral class, but mean low social class as well he probably means both things actually. What about those people of a low social class who are of a high moral class, what about them? Well he gives the example of a contemporary member of parliament, Mister Andrew Marvel who apparently was erm, because members of parliament were not paid at this time, he was sponsored by his constituents, so they subscribed to a he was so good they managed to subscribe to and he thinks that this is the ideal solution, if someone is really worthwhile, then their constituents would be happy to pay their salary directly, rather than, than have salaried jobs. Okay so this strikes us as a rather eccentric claim er he does qualify it, he says that there may be cases where there aren't enough people of independent means in a country to present themselves, he doesn't mean England here he means some of the dependent territories and then members of parliament should be paid compensation rather than a salary. So in other words they should be paid the salaries they would have been got getting in whatever their other line of work would have been, rather than special rates of the job of an M P. I mean it may well be that we have in this country we have erm pretty much Mill's system because MPs get paid relatively little bearing in mind what most of them could be getting elsewhere, so maybe we've got something like Mill's system but it strikes us as rather a bizarre suggestion that MPs shouldn't be paid to prevent adventurous and lower classes becoming MPs. Okay so we have safeguards against unworthy rulers, much more important though Mill is worried about people voting on the wrong motives. So I've said before that erm Mill wants people to vote just in the same way that people cast their votes in a jury on the basis of what's right. He realizes that they can't, people can't be guaranteed to do this and he points out there are four different motivations that people might have that conflict with the er moral motivations. First of all there's personal interest, secondly there's class interest thirdly there's rather amusingly some mean feeling in his own mind, so he has the idea that people might just be rather grumpy or something when they're going to cast their, their vote and go to some rather destructive policy. I suppose you might think in a case now you might think that er er certain people aren't entitled to welfare benefits or something that and vote for the parties that excludes them, but that mean the sort of thing he he doesn't make much of that. Fourthly erm there's the problem of coercion that is some people might be forced to cast their vote one way or another or feel they're forced to cast a vote one way or another erm which is something we are less erm familiar with. The reason why we're less familiar with that is that we have a secret ballot and so there is no way of knowing how someone has cast their vote, and so there's no way of effectively forcing someone to cast their vote one way or another. However, Mill was against a secret ballot, Mill thought votes ought to be cast publicly and the reason for this is that he thought people ought to be voting on their view of what is right and so therefore they ought to be publicly accountable. People are much less likely to vote in their own interests, much less likely to vote in their class interests if other people know how they're voting. Mill also thinks this is a very good way of introducing female suffrage at this point which he is very much in favour of, if you had a, if you had a vote on it should if you vote if er there was a vote among the male electors about whether women should be given the vote and there was a public ballot, then it's very unlikely they would vote against the extension of franchise because their wives and daughters would be able to see what they've done, so he thinks that erm the only reason for having a secret ballot is that you're rather ashamed of what you're doing and that if you have a public ballot people will vote much more responsibly. Now Mill realizes that the objection to this is the last problem coercion, that if people's votes are known, then some people might be able to put pressure on others to vote one way rather than another and as I said why the secret ballot was brought in in the first place. For Mill's view is that coercion is now less of a worry than people voting on their class interest or their personal interest. Er here erm you can form your own views about whether Mill's right or wrong, I mean that the situation of a secret ballot was brought in to erm overcome as one where the local industrist industrialist who employed half the member of the town was also standing for parliament. Now erm in this case would your job be safe if your vote was known and you didn't vote for your boss? I mean it seems to me in those cases a secret ballot is highly desirable and coercion would be more of a danger than people voting er from the mo wrong moral motivation. But it might just be that we can't have both and we can't ensure that people vote from the right from moral motivation rather than personal interest and we can't ensure vote on coercion erm at the same time so perhaps other remedies are necessary. Now the other remedies have is one which is rather distinct of Mill that he thinks that erm of all of these forced motivations class interest is the most damaging and he argues there's a remedy for this, we'll see why it's a remedy in a minute, that certain people ought to be given more than one vote so that although everyone should have some votes, not everyone should have the same number of votes. In particular he thinks the educated should have at least two votes, he doesn't say how many erm that's a matter determined case-by-case I take it, erm erratically it could be a thousand votes I mean he doesn't rule that out, he doesn't say it has to be more than one er two, but erm his view is that the educated to a specially privileged in a specially privileged position because they are erm more able to use their vote sensibly or to be given more than one vote, so we need now there's going to be a question erm how do you know who the educated people are to make such suggestions, anyone with a university degree will be pleased to hear gets more than one vote on Mill's system. Anyone who enters the liberal profession so accountancy, medical and so on erm he made some other suggestions which we'll look at shortly. But there is something of a tension in Mill's view, because he thinks that erm it's very important that if there is plural voting then the people who only have one vote should be prepared to accept the situation, so that the reasons why these people are given extra votes should be reasoned that the public, the uneducated accept past critics have pointed out if that's going to be the case, why is it necessary to give these people extra votes, give the educated actual votes, because if the uneducated accept that the decisions of the educated are worth more than their own decisions, the opinions of the educated are worth more than the opinions of the uneducated, if they really do accept that, what's to stop them just following the decisions of the educated in their own vote? Why not simply take advice? So there's no reason why these people should be given more votes rather their superior status can be recognized by giving them more informal influence. I was actually astonished to find Mill making exactly this argument against another proposal in erm a later chapter because he considers a possibility and some people have put forward the view apparently, I haven't heard of this, erm in the version that Mill discusses, that the two stage action where we vote for people who then go to vote for the members of parliament so the individual people don't vote directly for members of parliament but they vote for people who then have elections an election among themselves. This is rather like the American system of presidential elections except that in the American system, the people who are voted for are tied to a particular candidate, so it's really just erm a convoluted way of having a direct system rather than a genuinely indirect system here. But Mill considers what, what reasons could there possibly be for having this two stage process. The arguments given in favour is that we vote for the wise and then the wise go on to make a proper final decision about who's best. Mill says exactly what I just said in response of him that is if the people are prepared to accept these why what's to stop them consulting and asking for advice about how they should cast their vote and so Mill later on gives a response to his own suggestion about plural voting in effect without realizing that what he's done. Anyway that's not important, the important thing is that he makes this, this idea that the educated should be erm given plural votes, in order to protect democracy being distorted by class interest. Now the most important threat to democracy and the way in which class interest may establish itself is Mill thinks through stupidity and this is the most er challenging threat to democracy. The, the, the numerical majority he says may just not have the intelligence to make the right decisions and what he's particularly concerned about is that the uneducated poor who he calls the numerical majority will vote to equalize property. Now his argument against this is not that actual right to property, but it's actually against the interests of the uneducated poor to equalize property if property is equalized then the economy will so he uses some sort of incentive argument here and maybe some sort of undertones here that inequalities are necessary to make the worse off better off than they would have been without them, but he thinks the uneducated poor may well be too stupid to understand this so they may go to their immediate selfish interest rather than their long-term interest. There's a further point that the effects of the policy may not strike in the first generation anyway, it may be long-term before er equalization of property has the effect and other things so these people might, might vote in their own class interest against the interest of future generations. Now Mill seems to be very unsure what to do about this because he doesn't want to say that the poor should be disenfranchised, because after all everyone is entitled to their say in government, but he does seem to be worried that if the poor are given an equal say or the uned uneducated poor are given an equal say, then they will make a very bad decision, a decision which is against their own interests and this is one reason why he favours plural voting because he recognizes that the numerical majority might make a erm wrong decision, so we should make sure that the numerical majority don't have sway in a democratic process by giving another client more weight in it so he seems to between wanting to disenfranchise them altogether which he seems to consider and just emasculating their vote by giving other people more votes. In fact one thing he says er which might make you doubt his motives somewhat is that the reason for giving people more than one vote is that they're more educated, but in general there is also a rough correlation between property ownership and education and so there's a good reason to give the property owners more than one vote, people who own a lot of property more than one vote. Now he says that someone who doesn't hold much property can prove that they're educated they should get the extra votes too, but you don't seem, you don't have to prove that you're er educated if you're rich you just get the votes anyway because that's a good . Now actually Mill did put the his erm this proposal forward, he was a member of parliament for a few years and he was trying to get this discussed in parliament. No one seemed very interested in it. Well what this springs up is the issue, one of the issues we started with which is democracy in the tyranny of the majority is what Mill recognizes is is that a maj well he claims to be concerned that the majority will make a decision which is against the interests of everyone, but he's equally concerned about the issue that the majority might make a decision which is against the interests just of a picked-on minority, people with unpopular views, people who hold er members of a different religion and so on. So erm Mill wants to protect minority from within the democratic procedure, that is he wants to set up erm a system of democracy which is as it were proof against majority corruption. One way in which he does that he thinks is by plural voting, that you give the educated more than one vote, he says we have to make sure the educated don't form their own class with their own class interests, but, but giving the educated a bigger say will lead us to make better decisions he thinks. But he also endorses a very elaborate system of proportional representation with a single-transferable vote erm this is in the chapter called voting erm it seems to me actually his system is incoherent, but he doesn't think that, I mean he argues very strongly in favour of it and various it. His idea is that you can vote if if the voter in your constit if a person you vote for in your own constituency loses, you can then switch your vote to anyone else in the country and erm you can have a list of maybe ten or twenty people and erm you will so you'll hand in your ballot paper with all these names on, signed ballot paper because it has to be public you can hand in your signed ballot paper with all these names on and if your own candidate loses, then er your vote goes to your second person and if that person loses it goes to the third and so on. The incoherence I think is that you can't ever say that anyone has lost because you don't know what's happening in the second and third and fourth erm batch, so I can't see how this system is meant to work, Mill seems to be fairly confident that it will. So he has an interesting idea that we can set up democratic procedures to protect the minority within those procedures so that tyranny of the majority is something that afflicts only certain types of democracies, but if we have other types of democracies then we can protect the minority and the idea for proportional representation is often claimed in this light, but actually it doesn't work as an idea, because although it allows a minority to be represented,represented is a different from being protected and so even if there's a member of parliament with the one member of parliament with your unpopular views, that doesn't mean that your unpopular views won't be made illegal say, because the fact that there's one member of parliament won't mean that so his procedure doesn't work. There are other ways people have tried to protect the minority, one is by saying that the, that you can generate a certain set of rights from within the democratic procedure in a different way, that is if democracies flourish people need certain liberties, people need to express their own opinions, people need to be able to do what erm assemble where they need to and so on but more common is the view that democracy should be limited by constitutional would present the minority and this is a view that Mill doesn't really defend in representative government although it seems to be very close to his view and on liberty, that is we limit the spear that this government has control over so we can't, so in this view erm democracy is given a very limited role. It's very interesting to note that in contemporary political philosophy there is almost no room left for democratic decision making because in most theories that we're given, more or less everything is already decided at a constitutional level I mean think of theory of justice, it's the theory of justice that decides the basic nature of a constitution so the role of members of a government is simply to interpret and apply the constitution so they can make the most efficient tax policies given the basic constitution, but no individual has the authority to challenge that constitution and change it by democratic means. To it's even worse I mean there, there doesn't even seem to be a government in the there's just a police force and an army and no one making political decisions, so it's a peculiarity of recent political philosophy there seems to be no room left for the democratic process to do much apart from administer, so the democracy is given a very minor role. Okay so I think that erm some of Mill's system he has given us and accounted them a type of theory of democracy but seems to me deeply by between two ideas, one is that everyone will have a say in government and the other is they shouldn't be allowed decisive say if they are going to say the wrong thing so that on the one hand we have democratic equality of a source, on the other hand we have an independent theory of the good and a democratic process should be allowed to disrupt the good of the nation and Mill just doesn't seem to be able to put these two elements in erm proper coherent fashion. So what should we conclude about our own system on the well we do have a representative democracy here, it's very unlike Mill's recommended scheme. We have no idea what people are meant are meant to be doing when they're voting, this was a problem I raised are people meant to be expressing their interest, are people meant to be voting like members of a jury? We're not told and it doesn't say on your ballot paper please be sure to remember you're voting on what you think is right rather than what is in your personal interest, you were just asked to vote. So how can we defend the system that we've got? Well, it seems that none of the arguments that have been used so far would come close to defending the type of system that we've got. Now critics of contemporary systems say so much for the worse for contemporary system, we have to move to one of the other models, maybe suitably amended and only then will we be truly free and equal. The best I think we can say about our scheme is something that Brian Barry argues. It's in a paper I didn't put on the reading list because most of it is not relevant, it's called Is Democracy Special? and this in his collective papers. What Barry says is simply this that suppose we accept the point that authority structures are now necessary, that we couldn't have anarchy we have to have people in control. Well in a modern world we've lost the faith that certain people are appointed by God to do this for us, or especially naturally fitted to do it, so how are we going to accept the rule of some people rather than others? Well he thinks the only way that modern will accept the rule of one person rather than another is if they think they're somehow there as a result of their own action, so we'll only accept the rule of erm our leaders if we think we put them there and we take them back again, we put them there and can recall them and this for Barry is the only merit that contemporary democratic policy democratic erm systems that it allows us to think of our rulers as having some legitimate claim to rule. Without democracy we wouldn't be able to say who should rule, with democracy we can we can say these people because we voted for them and that's it, we can't say these people interests we can't say that these people act in common good although if they do very badly we'll try and recall them, all we can say is they're there we need, what we need is authority structures, we need the structures more than the people occupying the roles, someone's got to occupy the roles and this is the only way we've got of appointing them. So on that very depressing note, er I'll leave we've got a few minutes for questions or objections if anyone wants to, we've got some head shaking. Right. Er. Right, I'm not sure how Anyone else? Based on? Well everyone has, everyone is entitled to vote and he also thinks that if the time is right when unmarried women were property and he thought it wouldn't be long before married women to hold property too, so he was also he wanted to reform the Married Women's Property Act. What's your own view in a nutshell the way forward to democracy? Don't have one, sorry. Er I was, I was hoping to find one but er er yep Right so there's a thought that somehow democracy ought to be self-justifying erm the well I mean quite a long way actually two types of justification of democracy, instrumental and erm Mill is defending democracy surely instrumentally and we might want to say democracy has its justification of freedom and equality. But we still need to know how, I mean maybe in a participatory democracy we can defend freedom and equality to the system not in it seems absurd to say that democracy we have now is a way of embodied freedom I mean maybe weak notion of equality, but nothing No this is the last lecture. Right, well that seems to be it. Thanks very much. listen in to everything which is Oh right. said. If I can get you to scrawl your signature and today's date which is the twenty fifth on there.

Erm that's an A, that would be ninety eight ad so on. Aha right. Yeah. have a look I quite like that sort of texture actually, that's you know that's quite Oh yes yes that's quite nice that is. Which is a D. Yeah. Mm. See it's quite nice but We've got just a bit of sun. . I can't see the difference between that one and the one that was . Oh yes there is, this is slightly closer weave. Mm. It just depends how difficult they are to weave and that that usually makes them you know, more expensive. And if it's a difficult pattern. Well we wanted something that you know, wasn't just completely plain white, that had got either Yeah. a bit of texture or a pit of pattern in it when the light's shining through it. We've got some beiges as well that a few are quite sort of close to white. Yeah. I mean if you're interested in one I'll take one out because Well if you hold them up to the light then you see them Yes and then you see through That one's got a You'll have to hold it up to Yeah. in front of that light then Mm. you can see it Mm. Yes this is probably see them at night time. Yeah. Yes. Yes. I quite quite like that that one. Which I think is the same. Well on theirs I'm allowed to give you a discount, I bring that down to a B. The higher up you're going. Yeah. I mean I can get a bit more off you see. Right. So I can give you a B a B price for that one. It's difficult to say well I mean suppose with all of these, the the light the sunlight is going to Mm. is gonna be diffused enough isn't it. Mm. Yeah yeah. Cos you can see Yes it's see quite a bit through. Mm. that one. Well that would make Yes you can yes. But it's it it would still denser. it would still you know erm stop stop the sunlight from you know, Mm. spoiling your T V programs or something. Yeah. Or stopping it from rotting the furniture. Yeah my main er our main problem is the Oh right yeah. carpet because this this stuff does fade rather. You're probably better off with something with a bit more texture to it then. Mm. A bit denser. more open weave isn't it. thicker I mean they will they will protect your furniture it's just that they'll take all the battering then from the sun. Mm. Mm. I know white will probably d discolour a bit won't it. Over It's erm a long period of time, I mean we give a guarantee of two years on material. Mm. And a ten year guarantee on the headrail. So Mm If in the future you wanted just to change your louvres, Yeah. you know, you can do that. You can do it that way and it works out a lot cheaper. H how much do the louvres cost as a proportion of the Erm I think it's about half. Yeah. It's about half yeah. So you could you could replace the blind if you redecorated and changed the colour Oh yeah. scheme or something like that for about half the price. Yeah. It doesn't look like Yeah they don't call them other than beige and white and . I'm assuming that the that when they're actually made, when they're cut, they are actually cut absolutely dead straight on the the grain of the erm the weave. Yeah. or otherwise you you know No no they're gonna be dead straight. Er well it would be absolutely wouldn't they ? Yes yes. It's just that some of these of course, the ones that have got like a square textured, No you wouldn't get any sort They'd look a bit funny if they were sort of They would they would look weird if they weren't exactly. Mm. Oh no they'd they'd be cut like you see them there . Perfect yeah. If I got something and it wasn't The price includes VAT, Yeah. includes the fitting. What's the waiting time? The weighting? Wh How long to wait? Oh the waiting time. Sorry I thought you were talking about the weights on the Oh no no no. Erm it's two to three weeks Yeah. maximum. Erm if it's if you're desperate for them we can rush it in Yeah. a bit bit quicker. Mm. That one is not bad . It's slightly it's slightly I don't know I I still like that one actually I mean w There probably isn't no. That's liable to catch the dust a bit more than that I suppose. Mm. Well you've got to brush on the When they Yeah As long as you do them fairly regularly, you're not going to have any problems as far as erm That's acrylic and the other one you were looking at was fibreglass. Mm. Yes it yes it No I still like that one actually. Yeah. Well it's you know, it's up to you you can look at whatever. I'd give you the discount on that as well. The lakes one was an E No it was a it was an E I think. Oh an E. I think it was an E That would be a hundred and fifty two,two hundred and thirty eight. I'm not so keen on that much of a St I still prefer that. It's difficult isn't it when you've got a Well too much choice bit of choice. is is is fatal isn't it ? We've got Spice and we've got Snowdrop and the expense what was the expensive one? Dune. . You like that? Yeah. Dune. It's just got some . Yeah it wouldn't wouldn't matter if it was cut slightly off square either would it. Well it's not quite and you get the dunes effect when you've Mm. when you've got them all up . Yeah. Oh they th Well of course you will won't you because you're gonna go right the way across. Always assuming they match together. Well no they wouldn't match together but that doesn't matter. Erm might might be a problem for you. No it wouldn't be a problem might be a problem for a my mother Er your mother yes. Mm. Mm. So what would that Well I'll drop that down to a C, that'd be a hundred and fourteen. A hundred and fourteen. Mm. Cos that looks quite a nice one. Mm. I want something really that's not absolutely completely dead plain. Mm. Well Because it's quite a bit window. Yeah. I think mind you the rest of the walls, everything else is white so Want something that's a bit interesting in your living room don't you. Yeah. You know, depending on what kind of decor you have. But you've got white walls Yes. Well I I don't think we can go on any other sort of colour. Mm. Cos I think a big expanse of something that matched this would be awful really. Well I was just I was just thinking, if you had a patterned paper and then you had you're pattern in your Yeah. your blind as well Well yes, I think we'll have to stick to white . I think that's . The background . Mm. well we've got some sort of sorting out and thinking to do haven't we? Yeah, what about the erm oh what do you call the top bit of the rail? Oh the the rail The erm. Yes erm. Wh which side do do do they go to the side? They actually go, you can have them at either side, Yeah. erm you can have your controls at either side, the bunch going to either side. And you can Can you have it going from the middle? You can have the bunch splitting. Cos it being a big window I think Yeah. it's better. I'll just tell you about if you have it splitting. Mhm. Erm the two middle louvres that come together will overlap slightly more than the others. Yeah. Right. So the shadow w when the sun's shining You can see a slightly thicker one. becomes sl er slightly larger. Mm. That's the only er difference with those. But if er if it all going to one side I think it's going to be take up half the window won't it . I think it could be very heavy here wouldn't it. Mm. look better going. It wouldn't quite take up it wouldn't take up half the window . Wouldn't it? No. But a fair amount. It also depends if you have your windows open and you've got them each side and a bit of a wind, they'll be flapping . Yeah. Mm. think about that as well. Mm I I I still think the middle. You want it to open from the middle? Yeah. It's this sense of proportion isn't it? No it's not really what I prefer. Yes. Right. And what about the bottoms? Presumably they're chained . They're they're they're all chained together Mm. with weights. And they they go a hundred and eighty Yeah. degrees? That's right yeah. Cos obviously that's quite necessary . Mm yeah. The way the sun comes. Which end do you want to have the controls? Well it would have to be this end. You want the controls this end? No no sorry same end as the other one, same end yes the same end . Yeah it's a bit more difficult to get in there isn't it. Do you want to order now or do you want a quote? Could you quote ? Probably the best is a quote . And then we'll Cos we've got one more person to talk to Right. yet. Okey-doke. . if you can give us the the two alternatives for the the Dunes one and the Spice Oh I'd better just er . So it's the Dunes is the That one. that one. The dunes is the preferred one. Is the preferred one. And then there's the Spice. Mm. And was it the Snowdrop? No. just those two? Just those two. I like the texture of that other one . Which one? That well the . The Spice one. Spice one but er Yeah. You like the pattern of the Dunes one. Well no it's not that I just think it's the I don't know you can see through it more. Yeah. I Is it Mr ? yeah. As in the flower. And the address again please. . And your phone number? is . Why am I saying all these . With the er white headrail or chocolate brown? White. White? White . That doesn't make any difference to price does it? No. What width are the are the vanes of the the louvres. Er they're five inch. Yeah. These are three and a half so they'd be slightly longer. Yeah yeah. Slightly wider. Mhm. Well I hope they will be slightly longer. . Yeah. Right . You want it split? Yeah. And you want it er controls on the Left. And the other one was Spice White. Right I'll write this out again and if you decide to go ahead, Yeah. then just cross the one out you don't want. Okay. Mhm. Yeah. Otherwise you get two. Yeah. Which could be quite fun. Well you you'd have no problem with sun penetration then would you. No you're right dear. No. That would be We already have a roller blind on the outside I see which is useful for taking the heat off the window itself in the Summer. Yeah. But it doesn't have any effect It doesn't take the light off. . I mean that's got a very open weave texture. Mm. Ten Right, I'll let you fill that in when you're Okay yeah. It's a Newark phone number, yeah? Right. There's a little bit more for you. competition on the toes. Right I'll give you these. Right. Erm if you want to go ahead with it, pull the top one off, Yeah. pop it into one of these prepaid envelopes Right. with the deposit in. And it'll be twenty pound deposit. Twenty pounds . Mm. Yeah. And then as soon as our office gets that it'll be two to three weeks. Right. That says plus thirty, that's that's inclusive . No Well I'll just put it on. Thought thought I'd better ask. Yes yes . Thank you. and that'll be attached and when we come to fit it, if you keep hold of the one you keep Yeah. you needn't sign that now It looks a bit complicated but No no. No not really. got the idea. Well that's marvellous thank you. I've been thinking about these blinds for such a long time. Yeah. Really just I mean a roller blind's just too the window's too wide for a roller blind. And then at least you can see through while you're shading the sun from that direction and then That's right yeah. the other direction. seemed to be the answer. Well thank you very much. Yes, you've got your measure. I've got my measure yeah. Yeah. I've just well and truly broken mine, you know I chipped the end of the Yeah. tape on the it went and did it again on me now and it's well and truly gone I'll have to buy another one. It was a nice idea. put this back. Oh don't worry it's very very it's very easy. There you go. They're all on rollers these days. Oh right. Right thank you very much indeed. Hello there goes the phone . I'll answer it dear Right okay. Come in, come in, come in. nice to see you. Well what can we do for you today? Oh, I've a infection in my gum Dr . In your gum? Up here. Yeah. tablets and noticed that, I don't know,. Let's have a look and see what they've done to you. Aye, the Sofradex not doing very much for that is it? No, I've never taken them, I've just, I stopped taking them. Aye, I don't think they're doing very much, do you. You see I've had it here, I take it quite often, I take Right. sores, Dr gave me these to clear them, and it does clear them up. Eventually. Eventually, Right . but I was getting bacteria and germ, you know, Mhm. and I'd rather so I so I put a description in, asked for a description yesterday, Right. cos that would give the rest of my Right. my things. So she said it wouldn't be done till tomorrow morning, but I need something, Right. And I've been up till, I've been paining me all night Doctor , Aye. I'm just wondering if it's my teeth or that it's just my blood that's doing it . I think I think it might be s the the teeth, it'd be worth getting the er dentist to have a wee look at your your plate, Mhm. because there might be a wee rough It seems to be catching up here. Aye, might be a wee rough bit in It was all rubbing, and really painful all night Dr . And will I take these Sofradex? Yes, yes, keep on with those just now. And I was going to take them, I was going to take them, and I said, Oh I'd better, I'd better see Dr first . Aye, get Daktarin erm gel and put that on Mhm. three times a day between meals. Do I just spread it on my plate, you know? Aye, just a wee drop on your A wee drop, on on your finger and just cotton bud it and rub it ? and and rub it round top of your plate, just put straight from Awfully painful. Oh aye because you're right into the flesh. It is. Right into the flesh. Do I take these as they're prescribed here Doctor ? Yes, aye, two fou one or two four times a day. Yes, one four times a day. Fine, yeah, aye . Just take, just take, I was gonna take them, I says,I couldn't stand the pain any longer, Yeah. it really was, put me off food and everything Dr . Aye, oh yes, when you can't, when you can't eat it's not much fun. Here we are now. And how's, how's young Dr doing, is he? Dr , is he doing alright ? haven't seen him, it's Dr I think that's attended me the last time. Aye. I haven't seen him, I think I've doc seen Dr once. It was a wee, it's it was last year when you saw him I think, Dr No. , was it not? No because I got my gallbladder out in January. Aye. It's it was before So that that you'd seen him. Aye. Seen that much That looks like Dr . Ah I seen . That's right. Aye, it was November, November. the last time you saw Dr Oh it was Aye, well I seen him, He came up to see me when I was in , Mhm. when I was in getting my gall bladder removed. It's turned you into a human being yet? Oh No. Will I just pout the gel on or Yes. can I? Just just put the gel, don't don't wash your mouth out with anything. No, I was using some, I was washing with a mouthwash in the morning. No, Oraldene. no. No? No. Leave it, leave it alone, Leave it? leave it alone. Use your Yes, aye, just use your gel and your your er Sofradex tablets, yeah sofradex tablets, just take what's in the just take what's . I seen Dr , Monday, he was a clinic for before I went beck, a week on Friday for injections. Again? Again. Absolutely. In the bin. That's the best place for it. took him two reactions, Aha. to get platelet, to get platelets, two reactions . I must have screamed. Away and yourself. Right Thanks very much Doctor, thank you. Bye Mrs , cheerio now. Right, erm, eighteenth of January, er, Department of Finance and Administration Cascade Meeting. Er, Great North House, Northern Development Company. O K Marion, would you care to kick off? Yes, O K, erm, I brought what I thought would be a help from last week. Did your report back?we didn't have a meeting the first week, did we? Marion? and I wasn't in the last week so I doubt whether Do you want one on last week?, It's all there I assume, O K, right, O K, yes Erm, the quarterly report went out towards the end of that first week, erm, with the annual finance statements, erm, we're ple , quite encouraging because of the erm, S and E enquiries, were actually done on his proportion for once. Only just, but, because er, a hundred and eleven, if the enquiry's a hundred and six or constitutions, which is quite good, and obviously December was really quiet but then that's standard anyway, because , quite possibly not because it was sort of erm, he's shown with an which didn't So it's something folded back on one side yes,? I mean it's not that vital to me, but I hadn't Yes Yes. , but I'm not surprised, so, erm, in our previous visit they did give us Then was down in Middlesbrough for a couple of days that week, and er, I think amused everybody by calling it miserable all the time, I dread to think what . I told you how he was on the phone that day, I mean, he hadn't the foggiest idea of what, what he was doing or where he was going, I don't know. I think he got on er, quite well down there, because he'd spent a few days up here he had a better idea of what he wanted to ask, and what he wanted to talk about and so on, but erm, only because his deadline's and do you want to ring? Ah, right, I don't, I think it's now been called regional Christmas Day Makes a lot more sense, O K At Mercury, he clocked the sponsorship erm, late last year. Right, I must get some literature actually from Barry because as you know, it, it, we can't get it all out of the now, Right, oh and Phil went to the Stoke conference on that Thursday and Friday. He got bored silly and considered it a complete waste of time. Which I did try to tell Erm, I seem to remember that's the day that East Anglia kind of just disappeared in Mm, yes, yes. That's right, I was supposed to have a meeting on with erm, a couple of guys from the British Coal Enterprise down in Middlesbrough with , but unfortunately again the weather caught all of them out and they decided not to come, but didn't occur to them to say they wouldn't come, so I sat down there for an hour, and eventually managed to find a phone number and get in contact and the guy was still there, and he said oh no I'm not coming up. This was like quarter to twelve, he should have been there at eleven o'clock. No he got stuck in London the night before because of the bad weather, and he started saying oh I'm sorry I don't think I'm going to be able to make it. Well I said, I was a bit concerned, I said it would be nice if you could let us know and Especially since you travel er, er, twenty or thirty to get there. Yes, that's right, yes, I mean until you get there. I mean he knew that because he'd contacted me up here and I said well, to make it easier for you we could meet in Middlesbrough, save you coming up from er, Mansfield. I said well, it cuts the, it cuts the journey in half then. I wasn't too happy about that but never mind. Erm, what else, last week I had a meeting with Mike and Yvonne from D T I and Phil. I was looking forward to talk a bit about er, what they're doing er, in the way of seminars and so on this year and how we can tie in with it, and how we're going to erm, actually take over the forum plan for Eurofile. It's typical, they just accepted it all, so it didn't really achieve a great deal, but Mike told me quite a lot of things that I don't really have any idea, or I didn't know about, What achievement of financial business will four year plan, will it make anything else? I can't see that they can afford to be a high profile company? They're going to erm, they're going to give the money towards running a forum, but not a great deal, and then it doesn't even cost that much, it just really a question of erm, mailshots and twice yearly events or whatever. You don't think it'll be once they put the money Yes, so it's, you know, it's like two mailshots up once a quarter or whatever,minutes, and I'm paying for a lunch. you're thinking of direct costs, but erm, Phil was going to ask Jeff if he would chair it, and also if he'd be willing, to be sort of editor in chief, of Eurofile, so that was yesterday, and I haven't seen Phil since, don't know what happened with that and went to him that it was a briefing meeting. yes This individual just about won, in fact it was over by ten past two. Yes, Oh I, yes, I can see here, yes, that's only two It's more than I saw of him. Mhm, Why I'm not sure Walkies But erm, yes, so I still don't know what's happening with that yet, and I'm waiting also for them to confirm a date for this first sort of Do Business in France seminar, that we're going to help them with, which was originally going to be February, and is now going to be March. We think it was going to be the seventh and the eighth and the ninth, and they've told Newcastle City it's the ninth, but she was meant to confirmed last Wednesday, and she's still not. So erm, I've had a word Are export involved in this, I mean it seems quite if they're not? Mm, yes, but the trouble is they're not going to be interested in Europe, so they're not, Western Europe . They don't know how useful it would be but anyway, they said there, there's, it's a slightly odd event because it's actually going to be just in the Civic Centre, and er, and kind of tacking on some workshops and things, so I'm going to help her with workshops and have a display stand and so on but other than that, we've not really got any direct input into it, because it is very much, sort of, you know, this is how you do business in France, these are the financial problems, type of thing. It's just a good workshop,yes Which I was for shying off anyway, because I don't think it's any of our, our business. I'm mean they've got export people that know about that, and E C people one of those things. Yes, that's right, so I said you know, it's on a general level, I said yes, fine. But, er, other people start bringing up sort of problems with the French tax situation on such and such a structure of company or whatever, which is not anything we want to get involved with. So I had a meeting with Dailey to talk about the workshops and so on, so we've bashed out the format and er, and what we think we'd like to do, but it's partly dependent on D T I, because it is their event, and we want to be seen to hijack it. Erm, I had a meeting with Ian and erm,Do , Dorothy. Mhm, and told them that you wouldn't be your present arrangement Erm, yes, quite They took it remarkably well really, but er, I think there needs to be soft There must be have contingency, because Anne'd go up the wall over that. You know, I don't know it was sort of well, have a little bit of a boss at Bill then, as a restraining influence in the past I'm no help either, I did sort of wonder what she'd say but she's. They've been sort of so falsely jolly in the past, it sickens me. Get into Microfit, when you're in the data input menu I'd like you to call up the file Q M four FIT Q M four FIT file file . If you just look at the er the sheet, that we've handed out, they loaded from er from the computer it's that data that's in front of you, right, we've got three, three series, right, it's times data, right, from nineteen twenty three to nineteen forty five, right and the three variables are, textile consumption,United States er real, sorry is benevolence of the U S, so it's textile consumption,capita, real income er per capita income to be adjusted through inflation, so constant money terms and what the relative price of textiles P erm the price of textiles relative to the general level er the general price level. Okay what we're going to be doing is estimating a demand function so we can specify the textile consumption as a function of real incomes per capita and also relative prices, alright. A priori, what sign would we expect on those two variables? Say the income, what sign would you expect to observe? Yeah positive providing textiles are a normal good, you should observe positive er income consumption response okay. How about prices?what code, what sign do we expect on the er the price variable there? Yeah negative, right, textiles rise faster, the price of textiles rises faster than the general price level, the real increase in textile prices, therefore, we'd expect providing the first law of demand holds, that we get a negative response consumption, right. So that's what we expect a priori a positive coefficient, a negative, coefficient, positive on income, negative on prices. What we are actually going to do today is to look using this data, is to look at structural stability, right, we're going to ask ourselves are the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample, are they constant over time. There's no point in estimating a model if in reality those coefficients are not fixed, they're jumping all over the place. Right with those parameters, so if you just look at the er coefficional income, if we estimate the coefficional income to be nought point five right, over the entire sample, the then subsequently find out if that coefficient varies from year to year from minus six plus ten, right, having a one point estimate, right, er oh that coefficient is not going to be particularly useful to us, we want to know er whether our coefficients remain reasonably constant throughout our sample period, particularly if we're using this er equation to make out of sample predictions, right. The first thing we must er be sure of is that the coefficients within the sample are reasonably, er reasonably constant, right. If they are not reasonably constant, then not only is the model er a poor one, right, within sample but it can't really be used for out of sample predictions, because although on average er our coefficient that we estimate it might be nought point five, then the out of sample could well be minus six or something like that. Right, so you need to know that our model is characterized by constant parameters over the sample. Now the data that we've got here has been artificially casualties. Conference, the document quite rightly identifies the common ground between our two unions. It points to the cooperation which already exists. So why do we need to formalize these arrangements, why rock the boat at time when the political climate is ? You don't believe for a minute that this government will stand by while the two biggest general unions get together, no way, they'll attack us in any way they can and I warn ya they haven't run out of ideas yet. I'm all in favour of fighting the Tories to protect our members' interest, but we won't be doing much fighting because we'll be using all our efforts sorting out internal squabbles. We can also expect de-recognition by employers who are frightened to death by the T & G. It it's already happening. I tell you another year of feasibility studies will take us to the point of no return. Bill the and John started holding hands about a year ago and it's already resulted in their engagement and it's clear that they're planning their big day for the summer of next year! We should tell them to forget about having their banns read and advise them stay just good friends. Colleagues we have an opportunity today to vote this document down, to vote against it because the future of our union and the interests of our members is at risk. Let's take it and prevent a constructive back issues have turned out some previous lectures but you can pick them up afterwards rather than now. Today still unfortunate cos you've got a two page handout. Why? Cos they do little trees on them which takes space. Er, well this, this is the last week at Kings term which means that this is the last lecture in this series so if you come back next week you'll be disappointed. Erm the service continues next term with me starting and then Mike taking over half way through and what I'll be doing is supplying the general two theoried two theoretic semantics that I've been talking about erm two specific instructions in a natural language I can get what six definite descriptions and names something like that. So today I'm going to talk about notions of structure or about sentence structure and logical form, so point one a reminder something that I keep saying, knowledge of language is knowledge of a bod a body of rules that assign phonological, syntactic and semantic properties to words and sentences. Thanks. You've got a box in your head and it's got rules of those three types, at least those three types . Erm now, something that puzzled me for quite a long time when I started out doing philosophy of language er one or two years ago erm frequently you hear claims or we hear claims to the effect that this is a logical form of this sentence or this is the structure of this sentence, or this is the semantic structure of this sentence and I was never quite sure what that actually meant erm it's partly because apart from Davidson, erm a lot of people who write on these issues don't actually tell you what the background theory is and exactly what the point of the assignment of structured sentences is supposed to be, erm however after thinking about it for a while, I've arrived at the following following general view there are at least three rather different enterprises er which might lead you to assign sentence structure and er one needs to figure out the relations between them. So point, sentence structure. There are three distinct projects logic, syntax and semantics which might lead you, which do lead you to assign structures to sentences. Logical structure accounts for certain inferential relations among sentences. I'm gonna elaborate on all these a bit in syntax a lot as we proceed. Syntactic structure accounts for well and ill-formedness. Semantic structure accounts for the derivation of meanings of complex expressions from those of their components. It's not obvious a priori whether all or any pair of these projects converge on a single set of structures. And now just to spend the rest of the lecture elaborating on what I just said. So logic first erm point three. Logic needs to account for logical relations among sentences the sort that we'll learn about in elementary symbolic logic. For example, needs to account for why if the sentence P and Q is true, then so is the sentence Q and in order to do that it assigns a certain structure, for example as on the handout in my assigned structure and brackets P Q. Erm anyway erm it just has and has a separate particle operating on two distinct sentences that are not ordered syntax needs to account for the well-formedness of the structure, sorry P and Q. The ill-formedness of P Q and the similar grouping of and with or that is in English between sentences and where you can find one and find another but not with, not you don't say John loves Mary not Peter loves Jill. A slightly more subtle data the well-formedness of the following dialogue Sally likes Jill yes, and she likes Mary versus the ill-formedness of Sally likes Jill yes, she likes Mary and. Well what this suggests is that and she likes Mary accounts as a legitimate string with and at the beginning of the sentence, but she likes Mary doesn't, so you can't stick and at the end of the sentence. Thanks for . Okay, erm okay moving on to semantics, we're half way through point three. Semantics needs to account for our understanding of P and Q on the basis of our understanding of P, Q, and and. It might just assign a structure P and Q, three separate constituents between their structure. In each case the assignment is part of a large theory with its own particular data and goals. So it's a priori possible that the three projects don't converge. Erm okay I'm going to talk about syntax mostly erm is everybody happy with the, the role that the assignment of structure plays in, in logics and semantics? I'll come back to semantics a bit at the end. But if you remember your symbolic logics there should be no problems. That rules deduction rules of whatever kind er derivation rules or rules er applied to sentences in logic on the basis of the structure brackets what kind of connectives you have and so on. Okay. Semantic syntax and then afterwards the relation between syntax and semantics so I'm actually going to do some real syntax. Lesson one in syntax. Point four erm sentences are made up of noun phrases and verb phrases those phrases can be composed of intransitive verbs standing alone, or transitive verbs and objects so you can have four, the structure what sounds like Florence smiled actually has a structure as on the handout in the sentence composed of a noun phrase and a verb phrase, the noun phrase contains a single noun Florence and the verb phrase contains a single verb smile or you can have something like four two, Florence teased Dougal and there the verb phrase contains the verb teased and another noun phrase containing the single noun Dougal. Okay, that's the question is why, why does it have that structure? It might be that the subject noun and verb phrase go together to form a constituent, so you have Florence teased Dougal or the structure might not be that it might just be three separate constituents with no firm structure forming a further constituent, so why that structure? Okay, well I shall now give you evidence for that some which is straightforward, some which is a little bit more subtle. So point five, evidence for verb phrase structure. First of all ellipsis. This is where you drop something from a sentence or phrase and you leave a word or a phrase out. You can often allow a verb and an object together, but never a subject and a verb, so sentence three and five you can say Florence said she teased Dougal and she did, I E she did tease Dougal, but sentence four is ill-formed. Florence said she teased Dougal and Dougal, which is what you'd get if you allowed it and Florence teased, so you can allow teased Dougal, but you can't allow Florence teased. So here's the hypothesis to explain that ellipsis is confined to constituents where constituents are just what they sound like, genuine components of a larger thing which is signalled by sticking brackets, labelled brackets round them so they make a phrase and you can do certain things with them. Okay. Second, four B, erm the proform substitution where a proform is like a pronoun or a proverb or if you fancy a pro-sentence erm sentence five Florence teased Dougal, and Brian did so too did so means teased Dougal the sentence for that is a proform. That's fine but sentence six Florence teased Dougal, and did so Brian too doesn't sound right but notice that's exactly what you would get if you could substitute the proform for a subject verb construction and then it would mean Florence teased Brian too. Okay? C, the third piece of evidence idioms tend to be either whole sentences or noun phrases or verb object instructions, but never verb subject or rather subject verb instructions. When an idiom is just something that has the form of, has a certain apparent grammatical form but actually occurs just as a single unit of a fixed meaning, so it has no genuine semantic structure from which you can determine its meaning, for example kick the bucket means die and you don't get that in the meaning of kick the bucket. but notice kick the bucket appears as a verb phrase and eat humble pie, get your knickers in a twist and so on. So if you just generally think about the idioms like that, frozen pieces of language and fixed meanings you'll find they come in formed sentences and subject expressions and verb phrases but not subject verb. Could you say I walk, I walk? I walk? By idiom? Yeah. Erm well really it's just what I said, it's er roughly speaking it's when er a string of words doesn't have the meaning you'd expect on the basis of the standard semantics of the language, but rather has a fixed different meaning and whenever there's any apparent structure in it, I E several words, er, their, their normal meanings are irrelevant which is the meaning of the whole phrase. So like I said kick the bucket, the meaning of that idiomatically is just die, sorry die. It's a metaphorical meaning originally? Er, it might be I don't know in this particular case. It often comes about that way, it starts as a, a metaphor and then gets frozen. What do you mean subject verbs and ? Er what I actually mean is whenever you have an idiom, you can substitute in the position of a whole sentence or of a verb phrase, but you can't substitute it for a subject and a verb, leaving the object of the sentence intact. Yeah, so, so Okay then the general I'm for is that in a subject verb object sentence there's very important sense in which the verb and the object go together, they form one unit and one constituent of a sentence, whereas subject and verb don't. So in point of fact idioms is you'll find that they always fit in either this slot or in this slot, but you won't find an idiom which has to form such that if you remove the subject and verb from a sentence you can stick the idiom in there and it will make sense. You're the literary one. A, because it's not an idiom, and B even if it were it would be a whole sentence, because walk is intransitive. Well think about it I mean there might be one, in which case we have to do a little bit er dancing around Why doesn't the idiom just take the place of the verb, because if you get rid of the object as well? Well it's a verb phrase so erm they just, all that means is if you take a subject expression and well, what goes, what goes after such expression is a verb phrase, that my opinion not just you know . So, although in all these three, kick the bucket, eat humble pie, get your knickers in a twist er all look like fairly complex transitive constructions. They look as though they they don't really they actually intransitive. So that's okay, the point is that they can substitute in a sentence intransitive verb or transitive verb object grammatic How about erm God smiled upon John, God smiled upon someone? Er Meaning he was talented. Mm, yeah, good. I don't know, I'll think about it. Very good Well unfortunately if they're idioms, then they do. God smiled upon him, er idiom? It does seem to be doesn't it? Because if you substitute something into the God, it doesn't really work or smiled upon fortune smiled upon him. Fate smiled upon him. Yeah, it's not an idiom. Notice it really isn't smiled upon, smiled upon is one, is the idiom. so that's just a, a verb and then you can put, put in anything such that if such thing smiles upon you, you are blessed, God, destiny, fate, fortune. I'm sure there are things about Well there might be er and that's the trouble when one starts doing philosophy and there's real study of language, it gets really difficult. Erm okay, moving on to point six, and now we soon get a little bit fancy. This is more evidence for the claim that you get a verb phrase in a sentence erm, but it introduces, er it's also an example of how you can account for grammatical phenomena in terms of er structural relations in sentences and large expressions. So, point six erm okay look at the sentences one and two under six, one is apparently ill-formed, herself left, except in I think some Irish dialects actually yes, well it has a rather special meaning where herself is given special status erm in the context, but in normal English, English herself left is ill-formed, but two, Florence saw herself is fine herself is a reflective pronoun refers that herself each other or one another, the other are reflective pronouns. Erm and then if you move on to sentences four and five underneath them er anyone left is ill-formed, but no one saw anyone is fine. Still, ideas that the reflective pronoun herself and the item anyone which is called a negative polarity item, the item anyone needs to have something else in the sentence in order to license them they can't just occur freely in the normal position for er nouns, even though they are nouns. So Florence licenses herself and Florence herself and no one licenses anyone in anyone. Okay, but the item that licenses them the other licensing sentence you need in order to license these items, you can't just go anywhere in the sentence so sentence three, herself saw Florence is no good, even though Florence is there, it's in the wrong place relative to herself and similarly six, anyone saw no one is no good, even though no one is in the sentence. So what we need to do is you need to figure out what kind of items license erm reflects the pronouns like herself and make it a polarity items like anyone. What kind of items license them and where do they have to be in the sentence. Well the position the relative position is to find in terms of pre-structural notions. Erm, okay the notation for Flo Florence teased Dougal is it can be expressed, converted directly into the explicit tree notation on the handout. That just depicts the same structure in terms of constituents and sub-constituents, so the whole thing is a sentence which in the bracketing notation just has the sentence with its bracket and the other bracket's way down the other end, and this is mirrored by the label sentence occurring at the top of the tree, it means it covers everything below it roughly. The sentence is divided into noun phrase and a verb phrase and so on verb phrase . That's just a bracket notation made more explicit. Okay, we can now define certain pre-structural relations which we'll then use to explain the behaviour of things like herself so it's only over okay, and node X dominates a node Y right, where a node is the point where a label appears, sentence node,node and so on. So node X quote dominates a node Y if and only if there's a path leading down the tree from X to Y. It's straightforward, just means it's higher up in the tree, and there's a path connecting them. Okay, we can now define a further notion called C command the phrase X C commands a phrase Y, if and only if A neither of X nor Y dominates the other so neither is directly above the other and in the path and B, the first branching node is dominating X, also dominates Y so let's find out if X and C commands to Y, you go up the tree from X and you find the branching node, the first branching node dominating X and see if that node also dominates Y. Okay. Well I've just defined it as constructural notion and am now going to show the point, having done that. What C command really is is a scope, it's er syntactic correlate in the notion of scope from logical semantics. No, I don't think C means anything. It's erm terminology it comes along with government binding. Dominant. Which is if, I mean when he was giving lectures in government and binding,people would invited him would put up posters saying government and binding so he got all the wrong audiences. It was quite a serious problem I mean that you, you get hundreds and hundreds of people in a room to get jobs to talk about politics and he'll start Okay. What's the point for a C command? Well, well the main point is that actually it's the proper, er syntactic definition of scope and, but in this context it'll explain stuff about, er negative polarity pronouns. Yeah. Yeah. So if you look at the tree T one okay. Florence C commands both saw and herself because if you go up the tree from Florence you find the first branching node, that's the S node and that dominates both saw and herself. Okay and saw C commands herself because if you go up the tree from saw to the first branching node, you'll find that branching node also dominates herself. Okay, but saw doesn't C command Florence because the first branching node dominated saw, it's a verb phrase and that doesn't dominate Florence, it's on the wrong branch. Okay, so the, the reflective pronouns require a C commanding antecedent, antecedent really is just a noun phrase from which it can get its reference like herself back to Florence. Florence er C commands Florence Er er yeah I think it does actually erm, yeah cos Florence doesn't dominate Florence and the first branching node dominates Florence dominates Florence erm, Okay, now I've just used this one example, but if you look at erm each other and one another there is also a reflective pronoun to find that they work in the same way in the appropriate antecedents and it also works for quantifier pronoun relations every girl admires herself which is fine but herself admired every girl doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So I just picked two examples, but you'll find that they generalize a some interest. Okay, negative polarity items, that's the anyone case, they require a C commanding trigger, so if you go on to tree T two, no one saw anyone, no one C commands anyone but notice if you reverse that and you had anyone saw no one, with no one in object position, anyone subject position no one would then not C command anyone. So that would predict what we found, that anyone saw no one is ill-formed. This also generalizes er the trigger, is basically some kind of negative element. People, I don't think anybody really knows how to define the notion of trigger properly, but there's always some negative connotation like no one erm and you can say I don't like anyone, but you can't say I like anyone. Well you can actually, but you can't say I like you any more but you can say I don't like you any more. Erm, well C commands roughly it's just a noun phrase, which can endow the pronoun with a reference or an interpretation, so if Florence saw herself Florence is a noun phrase and gives herself the reference Florence. It does work for quantifiers Every doe saw herself and there the interpretation of herself is like in logic. Every X, X doe X saw herself cos all the does are standing around looking at the lake, seeing their reflections so there is just a quantifier. Herself works very much like a variable from logic. Erm Right, no one itself isn't a negative polarity item negative polarity item is the one that needs to be licensed by something else. Given them the negative polarity item I give a damn. I don't give a damn. Actually the trouble is the grammatic ones is people deliberately messing about, especially Americans. How about erm the grim reaper called upon you can't do that the same thing as God smiled upon? The grim reaper called upon. Yes, it's different because the First of all the grim reaper grim reaper's just a name for a fictional being and I think that is a normal Yeah. It just means the grim reaper has been called upon probably just means called upon. since you know what the grim reaper does when he or she calls upon you. Yeah, but whole thing is an expression and you can change the object. I think you can change also, expressions But that doesn't mean Well, maybe. Well let's say this, okay I just don't accept it. I mean let's say this erm, let's say that erm erm the crow sang his name, was an idiomatic expression meaning er that his time was up, he was, he was, he died, so he sang his name. Erm, now you couldn't do that with that and that sounds intuitively like the kind of expression that we might have, just because I can't think of one doesn't mean that But that's a whole sentence Erm, the grim erm, the, the crow sang John's name, the crow sang James' name do you know what I mean? And that doesn't sound funny at all. We must have some like that. Erm Well that's tricky, because the, the object isn't what goes in here erm it's actually the whole thing. Yeah. The crow's name. But that doesn't destroy I mean as soon as the class is over, I'll think of one, that's the problem, or in the middle of the night Mm well maybe, I mean to come up with a, a clear example. It doesn't matter a whole lot, I mean because the er, all it would show is that metaphors needn't take the form of constituents in sentences. Sorry, not metaphors, idioms, sorry. It wouldn't show that the verb phrase wasn't a constituent. And does this er, does this only matter when the subject have an object that, that is ? Because I mean there's plenty of epigrams like a rolling stone gathers no moss, but that's a subject not a verb, and it's actually saying something totally different, or every time Er about the situation and sort of used in a sense about somebody's situation. Yeah, it's just, just that's the whole sentence. Yes. A rolling stone gathers no moss. But it's and a verb which are idiomatic and are used. Well the whole, the whole thing is a single idiom in that case. I just wanna go over the form of the argument erm subject object. Now, the, there, it appears that there's a whole variety of phenomena er which suggests that sentence divides up in this way and that can be explained on hypothesis we just call such a division a constituent, and then we stipulate that, as certain operations can only apply to constituents. We suppose that's a rule in our minds and that explains our judgments about for example and proform substitution and so on that's so we define the notion of a constituent plus label it with brackets, and then we make certain predictions about operations that can or can't be performed on. Okay, now one of the predictions made is that metaphors to, sorry idioms to form into this plus. That might turn out to be wrong, but that wouldn't impugn the other data the stuff about, er proform substitutions and particularly erm the stuff about reflexive pronouns and polarity items, yeah, that's why it's not, it's not actually crucial. But of course if, if you start, if you find that the other evidence dissolves as well, then, then you give up eventually. Yeah, the whole sentence is, is a constituent itself er it and can be a constituent of larger sentences obviously. It's just that it's the yeah. It just can't be, be the, I mean if you think of all the, I mean like say you've got a, a, a sort of er cockney expression for if he's got syphilis might be something like you know Johnny Rotten's kissed him or something you know, there must be things like that, you know, there must be loads of things like that. You know, there must be loads of things like that. I mean that just sounds like familiar you know, I mean not that Ha? No, Johnny Rotten kissed object. Yeah, but it's what you're standing in, in well Yeah. The subject and verb stay the same the object subject and verb by themselves which Well Johnny Rotten kissed That's it, yeah Yeah, and then the idea is the verb you plug in there, whatever then you plug in there is fine. You then get a grammatical sentence and means this person. syphilis You're right, it doesn't sound odd, but then the question is why does this all really occur? It does really occur, I'm sure if it doesn't sound odd, it must occur If it doesn't sound odd, you'd expect it to occur. I'm sure it does. I know that. Yeah. how would you We'll be just like T two with no one and anyone reversed. Yeah, but Yeah, but the, the claim is that anyone needs to be licensed by the C commanding trigger which is no one and the point is that erm anyone will then not be C commanded by no one, because no one is too far down the tree. Erm but notice if you stick an if in, you have if anyone saw no one, then I'll be surprised,that does actually make sense. If nobody saw anybody yesterday I'd be amazed it's fine because if is the legitimate trigger and it would C command no one. Okay, erm, just carrying on quickly it's very hard to see how you could account for erm the stuff about reflectives and the polarity items if you didn't have the structures of the kind you get with T one and T two on verb phrases, erm and the reason's just erm you want that kind of a symmetry between say Florence and herself between their positions in the tree and no one and anyone except you can't reverse them, things like that. If you had less structure as in T three which is a ternary branching tree, instead of binary branching be just an N P B N P, it's real hard to see how you can account for the data. You can try it of course, you can try and use erm linear ordering and things like to explain the data just turns out often these doesn't work. So now point seven. Neither semantics nor logic requires V P structure, a priori, that is there's no particular reason why you'd expect verb phrase structuring in particular from either of those two enterprises, because either could get by with er either the flat structure Florence teased Dougal, that's the structure in T three three separate constituents, or teased Florence Dougal where teased is one constituent and Florence Dougal is another which is the way we most standardly do it calculus and that works fine. So erm, if you're looking, if you're looking for semantic structure, which is any structure such as and you then provide interpretations for parts of sentences and rules are getting sentence meaning from word meaning in the structure, you can get by with crude structures that don't discriminate very much and the same applies to logic. When you do syntactics, you get finer structures, more detailed, more complex. So now, what are the relations between them erm we talked about the logical bit last time, but about semantics and syntactics and point eight. Well here's an actual hypothesis to make, semantic structure just the syntactic structure. Why? Well, A, this would be an economical and elegant way for our knowledge of language to be organized. Syntactic structure does appear to be suitable for semantic purposes, one can develop compositional semantic rules that apply to syntactic structures. Basically because in syntax you get all the structure you need for semantics and some more, which doesn't do any harm. Now, suppose you are designing a language learning and using machine you really wouldn't want to have separate levels of structure for syntax and semantics. It would be pointless it would be messy it would be inelegant and it would create the problem of the relations between the two, you'd have to have transformations to get you from one to the other. So the first thing you'd expect on just by the false but enormously appealing principle that the world is simple and elegant, is there is just one level of structure there. It's a terrible thing actually, because you always pretty much er once they work, once they to the data and people still worry about it, why have rather than some other. They it's simple, it's nice, it's elegant and it's not an item at all unless you have a further premise that the world itself is simple, nice and elegant and you have no reason to believe that at all, but since that applies across all sides, I think linguistics is in no worse shape. Okay, secondly and more importantly eight B the idea that syntactic and semantic structure are the same, or rather that semantics just works over the syntactic structure, erm that would help solve the acquisition problem. Remember the acquisition problem infants acquire language on the basis of minimal evidence, that's called a poverty of stimulus problem, which I talked about a bit in lecture one or two. It's just it's very very very well, put it this way, children seem to learn language very very very very quickly and they've got very very very little data to go on when they learn the language. small number of sentences number that they come out understanding and that's rather mysterious So to explain just in general terms, you're interested in describing language in such a way that it's the kindest thing that's easy to learn, rather than hard to learn. That's the basic idea and the fact that we do actually learn, becomes less mysterious. So now, if syntactic and semantic structure are the same then both kinds of evidence, both semantic evidence and syntactic evidence will, will constrain the choice of structure. One of the things the kid's got to do learn his language sentence and in the context he can figure out what the sentence has to mean, like radical interpretation kid, the kid is sitting playing on the floor, a rabbit's bounced by and the mother goes . Okay. Erm, the kid's got to figure out if it's going to use that to project the other sentences then it might come across it's got to, it's gotta decompose that into structure. Right. That's one of the important tasks. Well, if there's only one level of structure then evidence about the and evidence of that meaning are both going to bear on that. the same structure. If there were two levels of structure, the task would be much much harder. Okay, so language would be much easier to learn if this hypothesis were true, rather than if it were not true. Er, for example? More or less yeah. Yeah, Are they a related meaning? I mean Yeah It might just be a case Yeah Yeah, obtained, just they're just photographs. Words that are spelt and sound the same just like and How about identifying the normal and identifying the philosophy? Erm what's that going to find the philosophy say? identify it. Er, well as in the English you'd probably say if you didn't study philosophy, you'd say were identified as Venus, but it's not the same thing. Er, yeah. It's just I mean as philosophy just very standardly takes words from ordinary language gradually gets a technical meaning, er which is different from the original meaning and then when ordinary speakers use it in the original meaning they get told off. Er, that's I mean, I think if you really, in these cases you have to count them as different words just like I mean maths and physics doesn't mean what maths used to mean in English. Energy certainly doesn't. necessary Necessary er all those things. It's hard, I mean it's, it's difficult to tell, difficult to decide when the meaning has actually changed it's a notoriously hard problem, which nobody really knows how to solve in the principle way. Nevertheless sometimes it clearly has and other times it clearly hasn't, so there does seem to be a line there, even if we don't yet know, we certainly have to draw it. Mm. Erm I don't know if I mean remember that in order to do any compositional semantic theory, you have to assign structuring. Remember the little truth theory that we did in lecture two or three, or when you do semantics in logic by swinging two model theories, when you interpret the expressions of a logical language, you have to assign a structure and, er the claim here is just that the natural language, that structure, structure that the semantic interpretation rules apply to, it's just the syntactic structure. Is that okay? Yeah, It does, I mean it's it wasn't clearly formulated until er about nineteen sixty eight I think by Gilbert Harman Davidson Davidson kind of claims this in semantics in natural languages which I suggested that you read, but Davidson puts the claim the other way round, that is there's no more syntax than that structure needs in semantics and that's just false, that's just false because you're not going to account for all the data I've been talking about, about verb phrases. Semantic structure? Er, yeah, it doesn't really er But Davidson actually makes the claim that you to assign no more structure than what's required by a truth theory just to get the coming out right. Don't ask me what truth theories. Okay. Davidson says, I think he actually claims all you need to do is, is to develop your compositional semantics to get the truth theories coming out right and that's the only notion of structure you need. He doesn't really, doesn't seem to have room for his idea of having independently motivated syntactic structure I don't know why cos simple idea, but I think But is it true about the semantic structure where you can say it hasn't got a verb phrase yeah. then the other one still has to have the equivalent of a C commanding although it's in a, in a different way. But you wouldn't have C command, I mean that if you take the first structure in seven, that's just the one in T three. Okay so now suppose you have Florence as the first noun in T three and herself no do it the other way round, suppose you had herself as the first noun and T three Florence okay then you'd find Florence does C command herself but it shouldn't Erm, Oh, right. Er say if you look in seven you've got er, say the . Yeah, that's erm actually, there's that's this structure Okay if you said the first one was saw, Mm. and er and the last I believe there was herself then er the middle item has got to be a particular type of item. Yeah, erm And it's then related in the same way as the C commanding er in fact Florence does C command herself here. Yeah. So that's er on the other hand, erm it would do if you also, if you'll reverse them herself Florence which would, which would presumably be herself saw Florence structure, but that's Yeah but that's ungrammatic . Yeah, but that's what I'm saying there's So that you'd have to you'd, you'd have to, well you don't, you don't because the thing is you want an asymmetrical relation between Florence and herself, because Florence or herself is okay and herself or Florence isn't. Here it's symmetrical. Yeah. Now, you, you could have the linear ordering that's an alternative proposal erm, but then you've actually got erm you've got to come up with a kind of proper account of these structures of how they come about and of the relation and then you've got to check it out against all the other data and all I can say is as it happens, I've tried that and it doesn't work but that's only and we want to find out if you can see that the quite a long way. So I mean by, by all means don't take any of this for, for granted. Yeah. Well you have to you have to decide if that really is structure, it may well be that it's a structure structure is the other way round in which case Good morning. Good morning to you. What happened to sunshine? I don't know. You might have arranged it better. How many lifeboats are you going to land on today sir? Well we're going to have two. We have this one and then we're going further south and operate with the other, the second one. What happens now, now that you are winched down? Well the aircraft, simply do an orbit, come back around, back into wind and then come winching in under my directions using hand signals. Th the only thing I mentioned to the crew is to be aware of static, there's a lot of static electricity at the moment. So er just er let me handle that. Okay? Yes, thank you. Kieran , winch man on the Sumburgh coastguard helicopter, and the rest of the duty crew that morning were winch operator Terry , pilot Norman and copilot Tim . The honourary medical officer of the Longhope lifeboat is Dr Tony , and he would normally be assisting casualties to be uplifted, but that day he himself was to be winched up from the lifeboat to the helicopter, and once that part of the exercise was completed and he was back, safely on deck, I asked him, How was that? That was great. Absolutely You enjoyed it? lovely, it was a bit of an anticlimax I thought. I mean I thought I'd be absolutely frightened out of my mind but erm no. I think you just have a philosophical attitude, if they're going to drop you, they drop you and that's that's What did he mean when he's saying the static? Static electricity. Yeah. Well it's like getting out of a car on a hot day and putting your putting your hand on the door, I think. But I didn't feel anything. The only thing was noise. Have you done it before? I was involved a few years ago in the in the Lance, the rescue er That the lance went ashore on Hoy and er the helicopter there took the casualties of the Lance and dropped Yeah. them onto the lifeboat. Was that a soft landing you had back there ? No , I got a very sore Yes. Dr Tony , honourary medical officer. Once the exercise was completed satisfactorily, the coastguard helicopter duly saluted us and flew of at speed to rendezvous with the Stromness lifeboat. The Longhope boat, the David and Elizabeth King, E B, is a solent class self righting lifeboat and has been on station since nineteen seventy. Once she was safely winched back up the slipway into the lifeboat shed, I spoke to some of the crew. Firstly, Jack , coxswain, since nineteen seventy. Are you going to be sorry to see that boat go? Och well you have to shift with the times, and the new boat which is much faster will be a great help. Have you been out with the helicopter before? Yes, quite often. We've been exercises , this is the third exercise with the helicopter. When was the last called out? Not on exercise with the helicopter? That'll have been the trawler run ashore on on er Pearworth Gareth and we were all come ashore on but it wasn't er . I think that'll been the last helicopter. Have you worked with that helicopter that was on exercise today? Well er everything, Navy helicopter from Lossiemouth, we were out with The big Seakings? Seakings. We're were out with before. Yes, we're never out on an exercise with the Jackie , coxswain of the Longhope lifeboat, who was awarded the R N L Is bronze medal for gallantry for his part in the rescue of the crew of the Ross Turn from the Taft Tail of Swona in nineteen seventy three. The new Longhope lifeboat will be a forty seven foot tyne class, fast slipway launch. She'll be a tonne lighter in weight but very much faster. I asked the mechanic, Ian , who'd looked after the David and Elizabeth King, if he'd regret seeing her go? No I'm I'm really looking forward to getting the new lifeboat, because I think it'll be a great advantage from the station here. At least we'll have a lot of speed, The show a big advantage and a bigger speed, er out here. Have you had any problems with this one over the years? Oh none at all. It's gone like a dream, it's er I've had no major problems with it at all. It's just been a good boat to us. Really. But you are going to be sorry to see that one go because you've looked after her for so long. Ah yes I have looked after it for ever since it was new and er and it was the one that reopened the station after the boat's lost here, but as I say you've got to look forward and I think it's a good idea to to have a new boat here. Cos it's a good young crew, and everybody's pretty enthusiastic. Ian , mechanic. Billy has also been in the crew since the David and Elizabeth King came on station. And I asked him about that particular morning's exercise with the coastguard helicopter. Well it's like what most exercises are, it seems like a lot of nonsense but actually when it comes to the crunch, you actually know what's going to happen, you know the the procedures and everything like that. So that it's it it has certainly got a lot of value an exercise like that, even with entirely good conditions. How many exercises have you done with the Sumburgh coastguard before? Oh we've done two or three, we usually do one Well er I wouldn't regularly but probably one every year or you ken something like that. Today it was winching. That's just what they usually do for an exercise, there's no much You cannot actually simulate an actual rescue so that's the best you can do. But the conditions today weren't exactly calm anyway so it was a pretty fair exercise. Well I suppose but er you can imagine a lot worse than that. Billy . And the rest of the crew that morning were Billy , second coxswain, John , assistant mechanic, Jimmy and Vincent . Also Angus , who was the youngest on board that day. Well I'm not actually signed up but I'm going to start signing up now as a crew member. I just go out on exercises now and again, fill in for somebody. You have a relative though, already on the crew? Yeah, dad, he's the coxswain. And I also have a brother that's on the crew. Have your family always been involved with the lifeboat? As far as I've been told and remember, Dad's always been on the boat, yeah. Different boat. Will you going to on the new one? Will you be here when it comes, do you think? Yeah. By that time hopefully I'll be signed up as a crew member. Angus . And my thanks to all connected with the Longhope lifeboat, for my day out. I spoke later to Jackie , lifeboat secretary, and asked him how many of a crew he had to call on at any time. We now have fifteen men who have past the medical exam and the board of trade eyesight test and are now fully enrolled lifeboat crew. There is one or two not quite completed training yet. There's a great family tradition, obviously, in Longhope as there must be in every Orkney and Shetland lifeboat . Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah the the crew seems to evolve. The the father would be on the boat, and the son would, as a young boy, would come to meet the workers that came back and he begins to help with the ropes and the winching up of the boat and the washing down, and so on, of the boat after she's been on service, and so on . And as the years go by and the father retires the son comes on to the boat, so it is really a very family thing, the lifeboat service. What particular memories have you got of this lifeboat? My memories of this boat would be mainly the the big rescue she did and the Taft Tail of swanal Aberdeen trawler Ross Turn. Was ashore in a cleft among the rocks there and the the lifeboat had to turn in a position that was just about twice her own length. The crew were all clinging on to the side of the trawler and the last men off, Billy and John took 'em They got hold of them by one leg and they pulled them off. And the lifeboat was able to turn and to get safely back out again. Which was really quite a rescue. I out there the next day and all that was showing above the water was the mast. Wee bit at the top of the mast of the trawler. She has sunk by that time. My earliest memory of rescued people being landed by the lifeboat would be in the nineteen thirties, see. Going down with my dad who had been president of the lifeboat here for about fifty years, to meet the lifeboat as come in with survivors, I was just a wee boy at the time but I remember the Icelandic trawler, the Geyser and one of the first to be put ashore off the lifeboat that night, was a wee lassie, and she came across the pier and she came to me, because I was the only kid down there that night. And er maybe about five six years ago, a parcel of blankets came from Iceland for the Longhope lifeboat, from this same woman, and there had been no contact whatsoever between the time she was rescued and then, which was amazing. Have you heard from her since then? Never never heard from her at all since then. But it is the R N L I it's something like a huge club because er go where you like, you're always received well among the fishermen and the shipping people. And so I've quite often been in Stromness and somebody said to me, how are you getting home tonight? You see? As much as to say, well if you need a lift home, just let me know. So it is It's a marvellous thing really, the R N L I. I haven't had time to get it up on the machine to change again quickly but I've had a quick look at the situation with regard to the five per cent increase. Yeah. So the saving that we were going to make them, by reducing five per cent but increasing the lancer machine bearings and bumping this standard cost one up to well as it turned out, seventeen per cent margin. Yeah? Mhm. Would would ta make that three thousand pounds. Which is the one we've just been talking about. Yeah. And so we were going up from that price to that price. That's what I wanted to do. That's what you wanted to do, you hadn't discussed these with them. I've mentioned it to him and what he's saying is come back with a firm proposal. Obviously what happened then this was before This is because this was the dead stock that we sent him. The tools I wanted to get rid of. Okay. Yeah. It's changed really now because of the fact we pulled Yeah. we've got more of a leverage so we Yeah. need to re-look at how we Because he's mentioned straight away, as soon as he was in the mire Right. well you know, the five per cent reduction you know, don't worry about that at the minute and and all this sort of thing so Right yeah. it it does need another Yeah. looking at. Basically what if we do increase to that price. Yeah. On the machine build that he's given me for this year, of which that is an example. The two arrow machines use it and there's a hundred and two hundred and nine machines altogether Yeah. Mill which will have three of these one each machine. six hundred bearings pairs. Six hundred and thirty seven to be precise Right. yes. Well the difference is about six hundred and seventy two pounds. You mean the increase in prices. Yes that's how much extra it'll cost him. Yeah. Er we've run up a cost of two hundred and fifty quid getting . And the rest and the rest . Well this is this is what the point Yeah. I think now's the time. I want to try and get it done, bearing in mind Elaine's going to have to have the baby on Friday if she hasn't had it before. Yeah. So will more than likely be off next week, but I do want to try and get something done with this and some of the other accounts, I want to try and get them out the way before I Right. . Now what's the the how have you calculated the five per cent erm reduction? Is th is that because all Yeah. these are down five per ce No that's not it. That's down five, that's dow er that's up That's up. because it's the lancer machine. That one's up because it's the lancer machine. It's just those two that'll have gone down by five per cent which are the sabre machine bearings. Right. Okay? So what's that five per cent negative worth to us? Well what I what I did here, to work it out so I could come up to some sort of value, is I said I haven't had time to chuck these back on the screen yet to start again Yeah. but this is where it got to when we talked about it last time. Er is I'd looked at the using their machine build which I've built in , Yeah. on the sabre range, the lancers and the arrows, Yeah. it would mean that is the price that they would sell at the nineteen ninety four price volume. And that's the price up to that one. Yeah that's it, the first five lines. So you're going for a five six to five nine, thirteen nine to fourteen six, thirteen seven to fourteen five. So that that's the saving effect, the difference between those two is the saving . Yeah, that is the saving that they would have made on each of those builds . So we're talking there about I'll I'll do it on the computer but Savings savings of whatever this is, it's three hundred erm that's er seven hundred, that's a thousand . Er thirteen seven that's eight hundred, that's eighteen hundred. That's a big one isn't it. About fifteen hundred. Er that's three thousand three hundred forty eight machines you see. Right, so another sixteen hundred there. So so that's four or five thousand pounds that we're giving to them. Right and and by putting these prices up on the lancer and that I was actually clawing a couple of thousand pound back off them. And that's I was trying to put myself in the position of before. Still offering them a three thousand pound saving. Yeah. But helping our spread if you know what I mean. Yeah? Right. Now it's a different ball game because we I think we have an opportunity to maintain that price for a while. I mean i it's it's where we feel we need to make the emphasis. This is based on full full year isn't it. Yeah. Erm one of the things that er would be nice to end up with is a price on the books which is the higher price. Yeah. So that the price we want to end up with on the books is is Mhm. that one, that one, that one Yeah. that one and that one. Yeah, now well this is That one e erm I mean I'm a I was just I I said twenty pound O six, it was a quick calculation, it ends up at seventeen per cent margin. Erm you see it's it's balancing that between the fact that we don't Mm. But we're s we're gonna be charging it approximately twice as much as would. But we've helped him. And I think we've got But but but we're only charging twice as much as would erm because are providing a standard bearing. Er well selected for their standards that we think is the only way they could do it. Yeah. Although, understanding the way, volume manufacture and I would say they've probably if they've got similar production facilities, got a very good chance of producing good stuff anyway. Along the lines of , there's a very good probability they'll just take Mm. it straight off the line knowing that it's coming in. We we haven't got as precision. So what's the advantage of of our product over theirs. Nothing really. Think of one. Well er . There must be some dimensions that have been more thoroughly checked than than er Well no because I c I can't say exactly how 's applying their product. They could be doing it on a Yes well ninety per cent of them will be P five. They could be selecting them off the Yeah. line. Yeah if they if their churning out the stock that tu tend to churn out, I mean I go along for an enquiry for a few and find they've got thousands in stock. You know. And you think, Bloody hell, well I'm not surprised they can guarantee getting P fives. If I had all them to choose from, I could guarantee it. I don't know how they're achieving the price. I mean they're they're s they were something like twelve quid a pair. Yeah? Now John says he he can only imagine that they're selecting them out. But then again, John's a precision man. Yeah. Yeah? So you know, coming to terms with how manage to do what they do, you can see it's probably actually not too bad a price to charge when they can get them cheaper . Yeah yeah yeah yeah. But but we also know that if er select from the end of the line of standard production. They don't select on every feature, they only select on some. Don't they? No not necessarily they could er they could check for all tolerances And I don't know how they do it. This is it I don't know how they do it. It's only dimensional tolerances don't forget. They don't have to test them or anything. Well according to the the P Thanks Carol, the the the P five specs no doesn't involve noise testing. No it's purely dimensional. The thing is,the machine tool industry or super precision requirements be become use and take for granted a noise specification, the fact that it must run quietly. But you can get P Right well that's something that's something that you've got to you've got to differentiate. Mm. Ours are noise tested correct? Yeah. P five does not require a noise test. No. Correct? Yeah. Right so what you're getting from us is a noise tested bearing. Right okay. Secondly er We guarantee P five. We we are we're guaranteeing P five plus a noise level. Yeah. So you're actually getting something that you terribly badly need I put the seed of doubt into Steve's mind about the fact that I could not say that er bearings could be guaranteed P five at that price. I said, the way they're picking them out, I couldn't say that they can guarantee every bearing. Right and and what's the noise test that we put ours through, is that three dimensional noise testing there frequencies and and so on and Yeah the normal . Right, so so what we're doing is a noise test to super precision Yeah. limits. Yeah. Right is there anything else like that pardon me, oh dear . Is there anything else like that which erm er which we do that they may not do. Not really. Cage it'd be interesting to find out what cage material they're supplying. What cage material are you supplying? I've a feeling B E T N. B E T N. Yeah so it's the er cage. the buttress type thing. Yeah . Er okay, so you've got your quiet noise running. Quiet noise . Be sure about the cage. Yeah, it's the one, I'm not so sure what they would supply you see. Possibly nylon. They do tend to have single nylon that's a single strip that just folds round. They do a lot of that support frames. Do they? Yeah, a single strip that they actually just feed into the ring and then put the balls in. So it's not actually a solid ring, it's n nylon thing which sits in. Oh yeah they use that f in in the in the P two and buy one then just take wheel with you they'll stick them straight on. Mm that fellow don't go to the police. Lucky to get away with having to buy him a wheel compensation Unusual innit. It's very expensive that's why it's unusual. Sixty nine ninety nine. is that all right? It is done isn't It? why have you got that on your head. What's it doing take it off. Oh yeah. take it off Mm. take it off I don't like it, take it off What? What's wrong with you? What? What? He's bloody mad, he's potty, off his rocker. Where did you get it? Get what? The thing. Well why Well why do you need it, why do you need a towel? Why do you need a towel. Why er why game. Mum and Dad's got it. Come on Mum. Go get in the blooming bath. Why? I'll rewi rewind that actually heard what you say, you must be very naughty and nasty thing to be to your son. I can't have a sweet then. Well you're not give me a sweet an all. Should give me a sweet you know. You should. You're gonna turn it off because I wanna tear you off a strip about something. Me? Yeah. Why? What are we talking about? Mum what's Hamlet about? Pardon? What's Hamlet about? Hamlet? Yes. I don't know much about Shakespeare, the only play I've seen is Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream. to er see Rome and Juliet. Mm. And I think I need to make it up. When is I dunno. Well you better find out then. What do ya mean I alw I'm only saying it cos I got Well no if you can go. You give me the money for it? If it's within reason as I assume it will be. Five Pounds. That's okay. W would it make much difference for you lending me the money. Not a lot. Well there's a quite a bit of difference between five and fifty isn't there and the one thing is for your educational needs and the other I'm so convinced about. Well Yeah. I thought a computer No, but I know that you're dying to have a computer, and if money was no object, then we probably wouldn't hesitate in lending it to you, but really and truly at this moment things are tight and we can't afford to commit ourselves with things unless it's absolutely necessary. Well And that's it, I mean I've made it as plain as I can. That is it and I hate it when you keep on and on nagging. I won't go and see Romeo and Juliet. Well don't go, it's not my fault if you don't pass your exams. All right. Did you watch that animated version that you recorded. Yeah. Does it give you the gist of the story? It,half an hour long. Well I think it's longer than half an hour. They probably should an hour at the most. Given you er erm The film is about hour and five minutes. You can probably have a video of it as long of another version. Well it's does help to see different versions because you see that different people interpret the Why do you Mm? Well it depends on the people who are producing or directing or whatever, so it's all got different ways of doing it. When I was studying I went to Open Air Theatre and I saw a version there on Christopher er what's his name that chubby fellow with the glasses Christopher Biggins that's it. He was playing Puck and when I went to see the Company doing it well they had a completely different way of doing it, they wo they did it really like er a dec you know the the mechanical play, I don't know if you know A Midsummer Night's Dream. They did it in a completely slapstick farce way you know th the men who were dressed up women they balloons and had rosy red cheeks and wigs and things, it was quite different. How they Well that's it, when Shakespeare wrote a play and the text has survived and , but the way of of joshing the people on the way they do it is different every generation and even most of the people in the same generation would would have a different way of doing it. Okay. There's a comedienne erm she apparently was born in Wales. Mhm. Two Ton Tessie O'Shea that's her. Two Ton Tessie? She yeah, that's her her nickname, cos she was quite big and she played the nurse in Romeo and Juliet in the season on Stratford on Avon and she did it using a Welsh accent because she thought Shakespeare, having coming from quite near the Welsh Border Country might well have had might well have had a Welsh nurse. So it didn't matter that Romeo and Juliet is set in Italy. Mm. She did it as she would have thought Shakespeare would have known people and things, you know, she did it like that. Mm. And I remember Amanda seeing a video of Romeo and Juliet And what struck me was that the costumes were all sort of like you see portraits of Elizabethan dress. Now I don't what Italy and those Middle Ages would have been like, that the sort of clothes that were worn. Mhm. But the clothing in that film struck me very much as being like Elizabethan dress. Yeah, I mean now plays of Shakespeare and they're wearing modern dress like those worn at Richard the Third or something and they're wearing well either First or Second World War uniforms. Yes. It was very different then. Yeah, well it's just different directors have different things they want to emphasise in a play and if they want to bring something home or they think that using a certain well like say the way the people are dressed and everything will will have more of an impact, you know will One thing I was wondering about you know they they talk about erm in Shakespeare's works is the language the words he uses, the the sort of poetry of it and the symbolism that's used. Erm do they talk about that at all in your English Literature Yes. Do they show you how you can learn about this, there's a book you know the book I bought you it's got notes in it. Does that help with it? I suppose Pardon? Well you should do. And what about I bought some revision books and things study aids or something for Amanda for her English literature Well I bought them for Amanda and she was doing Romeo and Juliet. So if you look in those you may find there's some help there. Yeah. Is there any more last minute entry for the quiz? Okay, sit, sit still, be quiet and listen to this, you ready? Question one which of Britain's colonies is most populated? Okay if it's any help just look at the opening tonight, nothing tricky that, it's just er which of Britain's colonies is the most populated?

Question four, fashion model and T V presenter Marie Helvin was married to which famous photographer? Maybe if you think along the lines of fashion That's the only one I know er I'm not supposed to give clues, okay fashion model and T V presented Marie Helvin was once married to which famous photographer? I can see we're having difficulty with these questions no it's just the answers, okay, question five, now this one's easy if you're a surgery, if you have a tracheotomy, where would you show off the scar?

Right, okay question number seven which substance used to be known as brimstone? Okay it's, shall we say a mineral? I shall which substance used to be known as brimstone? she's giggling again, what the questions are a bit difficult? No, too easy, question eight, in Britain we play draughts what do the Americans call the game? Checkers. Okay in Britain we play draughts, what do the Americans call the same game? Brimstone I dunno what it is Question nine, M G sports cars, famous in Britain, what does the M G stand for? I think everybody knows M G sports cars, what does the M G stand for? And question ten in medical terms tetanus is better known by what name? Okay to you and me tetanus is known by what? question eleven, what is the length of time of an association football match? Okay Ninety minutes. an F A football match, what is the length of time of an F A football match? question twelve who hosts the T V programme, sorry T V quiz The Krypton Factor? who hosts the T V quiz The Krypton Factor? number thirteen, okay I'll be very surprised if you don't know this one, who painted the Mona Lisa? again, who painted the Mona Lisa? question fourteen Middlesex Street in London has a very famous market, okay, better known as which market? Middlesex Street in London has a very famous market and the street's better known by this name, what is it? and question fifteen, right listen carefully which of the following names is not a bone in the body a femur, patella, radius, cornea or temporal Cornea. so you've got a choice of five, one of them is not a bone, which is it? Femur, patella, radius, cornea or temporal It's radius innit? Final section questions sixteen to twenty question sixteen which country is the world's leading coffee producer? Okay, I've said go for the obvious ones didn't I? Which country is the world's leading Could be coffee producer? either Brazil or Kenya Question seventeen Coffee producer the Pyrenees mountain range lies between which two countries? Okay and we want 'em both no half points for this What is it? The Pyrenees mountain range lies between which two countries? Question eighteen, in which book would you find the character Long John Silver? Desert Island er not Desert Island okay, in which book would you find the character Long John Silver? Question nineteen which letter of the English language is most used? E Which letter of the English language is the one we use most?

Okay again, the final question number twenty, which country uses the Drachma as its unit of currency? Cross it out you plonker Question six, pate de foie gras is made form the liver of, okay literary of a fat goose, but we accepted goose alright, so pate de foie gras from a goose liver. Question seven, which substance used to be known as Brimstone? That's sulphur I'd erm cod liver oil. question eight, in Britain we play the game draughts, in America the same game is called checkers er, number nine, one or two of you got it right, most of you caught out with M G sports cars, the M G actually stands for Morris Garages Ah got that one oh shit Okay, you got half, you got Morris, question ten, tetanus is better known by what name to you and me it's lock jaw, at least if you've ever had it, it is, question eleven what is the length of time of an of an F A football match? Ninety minutes, excluding injury time and all that stuff, ninety minutes, question twelve, who hosts the T V quiz The Krypton Factor?, that's Gordon Burns question thirteen, who painted the Mona Lisa? Leonardo de Vinci fourteen, Middlesex Street in London has a very famous market lends its name to the street it's Petticoat Lane question fifteen, which of them is not a bone, okay, we, we asked you which of these is not a bone, a femur, a patella, radius, cornea or temporal, the one is cornea, that's part, that's part of the eye question sixteen, which country is the world's leading coffee producer? I said go for the obvious one Brazil question seventeen, the Pyrenees mountain range lies between which two countries? France and Spain, okay, if you only got one of those countries right we couldn't give you the point, it has to be both, question eighteen, in which book would you find the character Long John Silver? Treasure Island And carry on just as if er we were proceeding immediately after the proposed excellent introduction and as if the intervening weeks just hadn't occurred. When this matter was discussed at housing committee, I believe it's only last week but it seems a lot longer ago, I spoke at some length about the errors and fallacies in the report arguing against a case that officers have put forward, pointing out mistakes and erroneous conclusions that seem to have been drawn from some very flimsy evidence. I promised members after that erm meeting that er I would bring forward different arguments tonight and that is exactly what I hope to do. I want to speak on only one angle and that is capital. Now most large businesses actually need capital. They need it to finance new projects and which they ultimately hope those projects will bring in a profit on the capital employed. But once employed as capital that money stays there, it's stuck and hopefully it earns money but it's stuck there forever until the sale of that asset is is a achieved. Many companies when needing to finance new projects have to raise more capital. This is often done by obtaining money in the form of loans, venture capital guarantees and that sort of effort. But if those forms of capital aren't available then the business has to raise capital by some other means and this is very often done by liquidated assets that they currently hold and releasing the capital for the new project. So the use of capital is fluid, right, it it's in a state of dynamic equilibrium as a biologist would be prepared to call it. And it is not it is not fixed it is not fixed or in geological terms, petrified. We in this council operate . We in this council operate a housing business with an annual turnover in excess of twenty four million pounds. Anyone who says we are not operating a business is deluding themselves. We have an acknowledged need to invest more capital to provide more housing for the most needy in our population. The way it is at present, we cannot , we cannot get more loot to put into the new project but the bank manager, i.e. the Chancellor of the Exchequer, reminded us a few months ago that the other way of funding our projects he encouraged us to look at our current assets and if possible liquidate some of that asset and fund it, or or use it to fund our new schemes and this Mr Mayor is what we should be doing. We must sell some of our houses and use the money we gain from that to fund the provision of new housing in the City. To miss out on the opportunity afforded to us by the Chancellor of the Exchequer is to deny those in the greatest housing need the opportunity to get decent low cost housing. So my the, in my mind the best way forward is for this council to promote the right to buy and I fully support this motion and I would urge members of this council to ignore the report that comes back from the housing committee. Thank you Mr Mayor. Thank you Mr Mayor erm a week is a quite a long time in housing but er er especially housing finance terms, I mean the system's probably gonna change again by, you know, by that sort of time. I think it's quite remarkable er that Councillor can come along and blindly say, well we've had a report back to housing committee, housing committee's considered this matter and the vast majority of people found it fairly unacceptable but we'll ignore that, we'll ignore that, fine, well I s'pose if you want to ignore it that's fine but I think w we do face here a a key issue and the issue of capital receipts, as you rightly say, is an important one. Now question is whether or not there is a simple ability to realise a capital receipt and use it I think, and if that were true, if what you're saying is true and there was some net gain to be made very easily then I think we would have a hard time, perhaps, refusing what you're saying. But it isn't true. That's the whole point. It is not a simple case that we can run along, sell a few houses, get the capital receipts and suddenly we can go off and have a wonderful programme and replace the assets which we have sold and when we're talking about assets in this case I think there's one crucial difference between us and you and that is we recognise that that isn't just an asset it is a person's home a person's home, that's so important an a I'm, just to talk about it as if it is is something else, y'know, just some petrified lump of cattle, petrified lump of stock money that was doing no good whatsoever, is a nonsense and I think most of us would agree that it is a complete and utter nonsense. Anyway why, why can't we easily use these capital receipts? Well there are a number of reasons, some of which are specific to the Cambridge to the context of this authority. As you will be well aware, as a member of housing committee, we do actually have faced a substantial crisis in terms of the availability of land which we can make available for building, that is one of the problems, possibly a short term problem, but nonetheless one of the problems key ones, which we face here. So we can't just realise the asset, dash out and build a house through a housing association because we have this crucial land problem. Now if our assets if by promoting the right to buy, by having capital receipts we seem to have a large balance building up, there is the distinct risk given the sort of policies that this government has pursued over time of a we will be running a risk there, we don't know what they're going to do, you don't know what they're going to do. But let's face it I mean if a lot of local authorities are in similar sorts of positions and a lot of balances are building up, well the money just might run away mightn't it it's happened before, I think it might happen again. I mean I don't, I don't believe that your government is stupid er it may be immoral on occasions, it may be wrong but I don't believe it's necessarily stupid. They've had a long time to crack a lot of these problems pardon What's the evidence? Well admit I I cannot actually bring an evidence at this point in time to support that er, that er er assertion. So if you were serious about promoting social housing over time what you would be working for is not a stop go economy in housing, not a stopped go regime in terms of halas housing finance, but a stable, a long term commitment towards er er a financial regime that will actually bring that housing through and that is something you have not done. I mean the autumn statement blindly goes a hundred percent to a hundred percent use of capital receipts. It just as go back. Now that's no way no way to run the railway I was gonna say but that's probably probably not the best choice of words in the present circumstances. But it isn't, it isn't a way to actually run a decent social housing programme. We need stability over the medium term at the very least in order to produce the units that we need, not this sort of one minute you're off, one minute you're not and again, if you were serious the resources were already there, there in terms of the capital receipts that people already had. You could've let us use some of that eight, over eight million pounds that we have stuffed away, set aside to actually promote our social housing programme. So basically, I don't think that it is a simple picture of being able to get a capital receipt and go out and use it. There will be occasions where indeed if people ar people in marginal circumstances are encouraged to buy then we will find, as the local authorities, that they will not be able to raise a mortgage in in in the private sector and we will actually have to supply the mortgage ourselves so where's the capital receipt gone? It's disappeared really hasn't it? Because we we've had to provide mortgage. So, time and time again, when you actually look at it, when you actually look at this position that we find ourselves in, there isn't an easy receipt to be made that can be used that actually provided what the business is about. Alright it you wanna call it a business the business is about provide social housing to answer housing need in this town. I don't actually really believe at the end of the day that that is something you that is rightly called business. It is a service, we are engaged in providing a housing service to answer housing need. What we plead with the government all the time is allow us a regime, a financial regime, that is reasonable and stable in order to do that. Let us not be fooled by short termism met by silly schemes that somehow promise an Eldorado which doesn't exist. Thank you. . Erm,. Yes Mr Mayor. I am very intrigued by councillor 's analogy with this counc er count er housing services by this council being a business and the Chancellor of the Exchequer being some kind of bank manager. I mean how many bank managers b force their businesses to sell off their fixed assets at a colossal discount for heavens sake. I mean if this is the way bank managers operate up and down the country no wonder the economy's in a mess. businesses are going bust all the over place. Actually erm although councillor is quite correct that we're providing a service, erm in some ways it would be nice if the government did give us the freedom to operate our business as we choose to do so. We would therefore be able to provide a much better service. Now it's perfectly now the cost er the benefits from sort of marketing right to buy is really very, very dubious erm the government has shown time and again that what it takes then gives with one hand, it takes away with another and the costs are obvious, we are fragmenting our housing stock, we are putting it, we are likely to end up with more and more with a higher proportion of poor properties and erm there's also the risk that if we do really have to be promoting right to buy we're going to have people who are probably not sure whether they can afford to buy their house or aren't sure whether they even want to buy their house. I think they should be treated as adults and allowed to make that decision for themselves. There's n I doubt if there are any tenants who aren't aware of their right to buy and there's there are in fact plenty of private mortgage lenders around ready to sort erm try and persuade tenants that they can go ahead and buy their homes. I really don't think there is any point to this motion. Frankly I think from our colleagues in the conservative party shouldn't really be wasting our time here with these silly motions, erm what's needed is if you're gonna improve the housing situation in the city and in the country as a whole, we need to be allowed to use our capital receipts, all the ones we've piled up, and we need to also inject money into the national economy to build new homes and incidentally to get the economy moving again and start bringing down the level of unemployment. So our colleagues shouldn't be wasting our time, they should be using their own party's internal democracy, there is if there is such a thing. To change the government's the policy if that's what one calls it, it seems to change from year to year. Thank you. Here, here chair committee. Thank you Mr Mayor. Mr Mayor er I don't want to be long in this debate because I'm sure we've probably all made up our minds exactly what we're going to vote on because long evenings it stretches and turns would like to say er er and that is though councillor urges us to be more totally er which went on the housing committee I think it would be very wrong of us to do that, leaving that er the vote at the end of that particular debate was unrelated to and er these democracy that's er situation. Erm, I think it's worth saying that er us j just reiterating on what councillor has just said and that is that I think most tenants are very well aware of the right to buy and er er the motion being unnecessary but what happens with the motion is that it possibly attracts people who really in many ways cannot actually afford to buy er to take advantage of their rights but who might be persuaded by very persuasive tactics to do so. Now er they are then in a situation perhaps often those people who are er less financially well off and sometimes in jobs which this particular might very well lose tomorrow erm their in a difficult situation as far as paying back mortgages is concerned. It's worth also noting at this point that if you are a tenant and renting and you lose your job you are eligible for housing benefit, erm if you if you were er buying your house, although you do get some er er you get the interest I believe on your mortgage paid, there are lots of other things that do not get paid but the thing is that if you have a reduction in your income which might happen where one partner say lost a job, er you s you're eligible for housing benefit but you get nothing as far as company paid mortgage is concerned. So on that ground I feel would be very worried by by promoting the right to buy, erm I've said everything I want to I didn't really want to elongate this this er this debate and I think it's but I think, I don't believe that Councillor mentioned the the the er the . We were talking I think this is the thing about clawback, er this year our erm receipts taken into account are two point three eight million as opposed to last year er this is taken into account we drew four hundred and seventy five thousand, that's a huge jump erm the government by in telling us we can send this er this er what I call minuscule carrot erm this year er the capital receipts from November last year until December next year erm a anyone had undoubtedly for most of that back in the in in the use er er a grant and I think it, as the government have actually kept extremely quiet on this subject, that seemed to be the scenario that seems most likely to happen. I think our erm . all those in favour. A couple of points I'd like to respond to councillors . Firstly I have never seen a more clearer er grant from the government to actually let you build houses this year, this is whole point of th th this should happen and if we don't take it up I believe that in future years to come we shall regret it very, very strongly indeed. As far as promotion is concerned, yes I will not deny every tenant probably knows about the right to buy but then everybody knows there are mars bars and mars bars spend millions of pounds promoting their product. You have to y y y you have to promote the product to make people buy it. I'm following on from that. Of course people must be advised carefully but it shows great lack of faith in human na in their abilities and a great arrogance on our part Mr Mayor if we fail to market the ideas simply because we don't feel the populus are competent to understand it. If we fail to take this opportunity Mr Mayor, as I as I feel we are about to do I am a hundred percent convinced that in years to come people will look back at this year, or however long it happens to be and say they missed out on a golden opportunity to make social, to make more houses and to make social housing better in this city and across the country. I very much hope that you will in fact support the motion as originally intended. Could I just point out that councillor that contrary to call my bluff, deviation and repetition are no grounds for allowing allowing . All those in favour of the proposals please show and all those against. I now turn to the adoption minutes of city hall and now it is a process of in that city hall did not endorse a recommendation from the finance panel, the budget that came from finance panel erm so we are in the slightly unusual position of having to debate the proposals of finance panel as we were recommended to do by city hall, erm that means as I understand it that er the chair of city hall will now present the annual budget statement erm and since he is going to do that in a form of an amendment er that seven other unusual features about the way in which we would normally do it which would mean that there would be er a budget statement and where there would then be the the formal proposals and amendments themself, erm so what I would propose is to try and make sure that everybody has, has maximum opportunity to have their say erm because no two amendments can be on the floor at one time er to take what the leader of the council said first of all erm then to allow the other two leaders to present their budget alternatives as it were, without it be, this is just not didn't take it at that point if they don't want to. But to present the full scenario and then vote er on the the different items er so that voting is done on items on the amendment before we then proceed er if you want to we just have to go to amendments to that because of course no two amendments can be on the floor at the same time. Er, what I would prefer to do is to er listen to the amendment put forward by the as if that were an amendment to the adoption minute since there's nothing to be adopted at the moment, erm I will then speak on that amendment, well I would probably speak against it erm at that point er there could be a vote on that amendment line by line. When that vote is finished er there there's then the opportunity for further amendment. Absolutely. A a a and that i i if that's sort of what you're saying. That that that's exactly what I was, I was . Mr Mayor on on a point of order Mr Mayor er standing order sixty two refers explicitly to community charge or the poll tax, I think that before we move into this debate we should amend that so that it does refer to the council tax which is what we will be debating. to my left has anything to say on the subject. My only slight reservation is whether it's possible to have,t t to move an amendment to standing order . Can, can we take that as being unanimous? Yes. Good, good. Thank you very much. Leader of the councils. We have known for a number of years that we with every other council in the land, are facing the government that does not believe in local government. That believes that local councils should operate services, should do it at the dictate of the department of the environment and indeed it's regrettable that we are surrounded by some local authorities who feel that their world is precisely that. Far be it for me to mention Huntingdon district council but that is one which immediately leaps to mind. The fact that their citizens leak into the city to avail themselves of our facilities is something that we might deal with in another sphere, even on day residents were seen to attend the theatre in this town recently, erm unfortunately this authority doesn't see fit to actually subsidise the theatre. However,it is that means that over the last few years every time we have actually debated about budget we recognised that the force had unwillingly and against the judgement of the majority of this council, not necessarily er bounded by political affiliation, we have to be getting down further and further towards the completely inaccurate expanded spending assessment that is assessed as necessary for the needs of this city by the department of the environment. Now clearly this is a process that is going to continue this year. We had originally intended to freeze our budget at precisely the level that it has been at the last two years for a variety of reasons we have decided that it is sensible to actually bring it down yet further. There are two reasons for this. Firstly the process of moving down towards our S S A needs to be facilitated because my own instinct is that the government, faced with all sorts of financial tribulations, is going to take a harder and harder nosed attitude towards local government expenditure, as it will unfortunately with an awful lot of the rest of what we have come to expect over the decades to be the responsibility of central government, clearly the current expenditure review is going to have some nasty shocks in it for consumers of account services, consumers of other assets of the welfare state but particularly I would suspect, the local government. Additionally however, we need to make it clear that when we have looked at the figures and I would pay some to the opposition for bringing er some matters to our attention, erm and looking at the way in which very, very careful on the part of this council has led to a better reserve position than we would previously have expected. There is a sense of which that good housekeeping with the inevitable consequences of government policy can be, can be in terms if you like, or benefits to the council tax payers, who have after all in a under the complete disaster of the poll tax which nobody but nobody in this chamber I suspect knew more unless there is at least one partisan tory who will try to save it, it was really a wonderful experiment and it's a shame it didn't continue. On that basis we have an amendment to the budget as presented to the finance panel and as the Mayor explained . If I can talk immediately to scope of that amendment before moving on to some points about the budget . With regard to the first lies my group has come to the conclusion that there is a way in which the employment development budget can be augmented to specifically reserve at least the part of the current posish provision provided by the cooperative development erm we stand by our opinion that there are ways in which that service can be more efficiently administered that this is a sensible way forward. With regard to the contingency contingency is something which has often been a matter of debate within this council. It has been a matter of debate because there are those in the council who feel that if you put in a contingency provision it will be spent whether it's needed or not. There are many of us who feel that it is sheer wilfulness if one assumes that there will be no contingency in the course of the year that needs to be budget . This year might represent a compromise with regard to the those two opposition positions which again I would suggest are something that perhaps owes more to than it does to actual political affiliation. The regard to the job evaluation budget suggests that our original figure of a hundred thousand pounds is not fully necessary and that can all be reduced to fifty percent, to fifty percent or the equivalent say to fifty thousand pounds and the same goes for the judgement with regard to how you are going to have figure with regard to jobs vacancies. That will bring the eventual budget down a fine tune particularly with regard to er recommendations of the housing committee with regard er to the erm which clearly there will be some people. What we have done is to suggest that we actually need a lower budget than we had originally assessed. This is in line with the obvious policy, not just of the ruling group, but I suspect of the council as a whole that we know that sooner or later courtesy of this government, whether we like it or not we are going to have to get down to our standard spending assessment. The policy of this council over the last couple of years has been to get down to that figure enforced upon us as gracefully as possible with the least damage to our services and the least damage to the morale of our staff and our staff are after all the most important asset that a local authority possesses and that is what we're trying to consider. Everybody will be aware of the fact that in the course of the last two budgetary years we have made savings in excess of what we had anticipated. Those savings have been achieved by very careful housekeeping indeed. By a rigid look at vacancies, by the constant search after efficiency, efficiency savings. By looking hard at any way in which we can raise extra income for this authority. A classic example of good housekeeping which has made Cambridge a authority in the region and beyond and one that even members of the conservative government have occasionally, through gritted teeth they're not doing a bad job, damn them and that means that the are going to think to have some of those, if you like, very good housekeeping back to the citizens who have been paying the bills over the years. For instance to this is an assumption that although we are going to have a shortfall on the collection fund, again because of good housekeeping we believe that this action is what people want by the charge payers of the city and again that in this financial year it can be taken out of the . This seems to me to be a highly , high responsible budget bringing us closer and closer to a position where we will eventually reach. We are spending now, if this budget is accepted, a mere eleven percent of the standard spending assessment levels which means that in time we are going to get down to where the government is going to demand that we . We may not want it but the government is going to demand it and we as custodians of the services on the part of the people of Cambridge, are going to have to do as sensibly and sensitively as possible. There are some more points I've got to make about the budget in general. The first thing is that I think people need to recognise that the investigation of savings generated a figure of one point four million pounds. That is an extraordinary amount of money to find in terms of savings. It's not a figure that represents gross inefficiencies, gross over expenditure. What it represents I would suggest, is the desperate attempt to trim off the margin to find every single last way in which we can follow the government diktat whilst preserving our full services. But I do think that we need to recognise this on council that there is a cost associated with that one point four million pounds worth of savings and those costs come in two different directions. One cost is that clearly some services are being cut in terms of how good they are. We need to recognise that some letters will take longer to answer that public loos will not be as fully attended as they have been in the past. That some community events will not take place. That some voluntary organisations will not get the grants that they previously expected. All of these trims at the margins which I would suggest, detract from the quality of life of people in this city, something that we regret, but something which can and has been enforced upon us. We're trying to the horrors of central government diktat are all closing upon this city. But there is a cost of that and it's a cost that people will recognise. They will recognise it too in terms of higher charges than perhaps ideally we would want to impose for certain services which the city operates, whether it be sports pitches or whether to be brutal, it's the cost of actually burying the dead. Perhaps those are things that in the best of all possible worlds we wouldn't want to but we are forced so to do. But there's another cost to the savings that have been exemplified and that we are going to be forced to take with regard to this budget and that is something that anybody who uses the city council services, and particularly I would suggest councillors, are going to notice and that is the stress that we are putting on the people that we employ. It is all very well to say to any people organisation you shall become more and more efficient. In the end there has to be a limit, there has to be a level beyond which you cannot go without people cracking under the strain, without people saying I'm now doing the job that was done by two people, two and half people a few years ago. It doesn't mean that you don't look for efficiencies but it does mean that we need to recognise that we are putting a burden on our staff which I think we will be callous and stupid to disregard. I that in terms of many of the so called efficiency measures that we could take, we are reaching the absolute limits in this authority. There are areas, one or two of which I will go on to elude to, which I still think are actually going to make for the greatest savings in the coming financial year and thereafter. But in terms of saying there are easy savings to be found in terms of greater efficiencies in this authority I warn you, we are reaching the level unless we actually want in putting a completely unacceptable level of stress on the people who we employ and who universally serve this city very finely and give such a very high level of service. I know that there are views among the opposition groups about what should be cut out of this budget. We have decided that the fundamental points as far as the is concerned is the presentation of services. Wherever we have looked for savings, we have looked to trimming away at the centre and preserving those services that are delivered to the citizens in a direct way. Some of them and we make no bones about this, are delivered undoubtedly to minorities, they're delivered to small groups of people in the city, to people who are in any care in the community need to be given special consideration. If we house them we need to look after all the people, we make no apologies for the fact that this is a budget slanted towards equal opportunities and to an anti-poverty strategy and that is something that we will fight to preserve and we would expect support from at least some quarters in order to achieve an egalitarian status in this city. The same is true of some of the bids, we've allowed more bids this year than perhaps it was the case in the past. The bids that we have wording of support. We want to do something for the voluntary sector. Fifty thousand pounds extra for the voluntary sector at a time when a recession, when so called but completely un care in the community is putting a tremendous burden of responsibility both on the voluntary sector and on we know what a good job the voluntary sector do in this city thousand pounds is a small proportion of the money that they are actually requesting from us. It's in a place in the direction of the work that they do, it is not enough, we would like to provide more. But ill betide anyone who says, says that that is money that's not going to be . Pollution, the environment, again that is something which is not just for concern, we know it's of global concern as well. We have some responsibilities in that direction. Yes we have to operate within our resources, but if we're looking to er how recycling that seems to us a bid which is worthy of backing regardless of political affiliation. If you listen to any national politician they pay to the importance of environmental concerns and to actually say that that's a bid that can't be approved. Putting more money into the taxi part scheme, a scheme that is anything but everybody in the surrounding authorities, how many of us have had letters from the residents of Gerton or Promberton or wherever else complaining that they want to be included in this scheme. Something that provides a life line, mobility for people who otherwise would find that they were being seriously disadvantaged, that their lives would not be as full as . Each and every one of the bids however they refer to particular minority groups, whether they refer to the group are I think, justifiable. They're justifiable because we're doing within very tight financial constraints. This is a very responsible budget indeed. It brings down our level of expenditure. It leaves no fortune with regard to what the department of the environment might throw at us next year unless they completely lose their marbles, which after all is always possible. Which I suspect the odd tory MP having a heart attack, falling under a bus, the loss of directions might actually mean that they might see a degree of sense in borough capping . It leaves few hostages to fortune with regard to the department of the environment. We after all, bring our expenditure down, we're down near two million pounds under new cap capping rules. That is not under any circumstances responsible judging. It is also the budget that has taken notice of what the opposition have actually said we listened to you we have not persevered with our original thinking, we've talked to the officers, we've listened to what you've said, we may not have done it with the greatest grace possible but . Comes very much as difficult to grace but erm and we have brought our expectations down. But the budget in general is one that we withstand. We think that it conserves services, that it has searched out the vast majority of efficiencies that we can find within this council and that it doesn't pass on to the poll tax, council tax payers the fruits, I mean it does pass on the poll tax or council tax payers the fruits of how we have achieved savings and efficiencies over the last couple of years. We've done well it's time that that was actually passed on . There are further areas which in time year will allow that trend to continue, I'm aware of the fact that there will probably be in the course of the evening that suggest that greater efficiencies can be found in a variety of areas whether it be in or wherever else. We have our own ideas about that. We have gone out with regard to our team through voluntary competitive tender. That is designed to save money for this authority. We are looking seriously at the costs of such in-house items as car leasing. We've continued to keep a very hard view of the corn exchange and a number of other bodies which we fund, but we're going to see what actually happens, we're not going to make blind predictions about savings without actually going into the facts. If we make further savings in the course of the next financial year the benefit will be felt by the citizens of Cambridge and it's no good promising them things which we can't deliver. This is a budget that promises what it will deliver. That bears the fruits of past, sound financial management, preserved services and looks for as many efficiencies as possible. Far be it for me to say that this is the sort of budget that conservatives ought to applaud because it is after all, a budget that is guided by a feeling that councils should provide services and they should orientate their services to the least communities, to be guided by equal opportunities and by egalitarians and that's what this group has always stood for, this is the budget that we present tonight and I would hope that it would get a far better and far larger measure of support than perhaps of course been the case in the past. Is there a second? Yes. Is there anybody else . Thank you Mr Mayor, erm well this may be a budget the conservative might applaud but I'm . Yes,one wonders how get actually. David Owen might be buying membership soon. But seriously I'm against this budget because of what is, what it doesn't contain rather than what it does contain. the policies that it represents, still represents even as amendment. Repeat this evening. That labour's budget doesn't do anything new to meet those challenges. Education cuts. Interesting the party supposedly in favour of education groans when education is mentioned. Interesting to to speculate and I'll do this a little later on, ask them why the labour party's so obsessed with opposing education . There's also pollution the environment,the council mentioned those, there's nothing new in this budget. Nothing new about the lack of public transport in Cambridge. And about the biggest problem today, that of unemployment what we have is nine thousand pounds put back into the the employment development fund. Still leaving . What we have is nine thousand pounds put back into the employment development fund still leaving a cut. This is no time to cut anything from the employment development fund, from the training budget, even sixteen thousand pounds. So the fails to meet all these challenges. Make no apologise ds ds to starting with education, the county council is cutting seven million pounds from education this year. A dozen or more teachers in city schools may lose their jobs, maybe more. More than half the city's schools are faced with real cuts in their budgets. County talks about putting a million pounds back in and it turns out that this million pound in fact is part of a two million pound cut that appears to have been made. It's all a mistake of calculation from when the government nationalised further education. The city could act, the city could do something about it but it won't. The ruling group, the labour party, refuses to do anything about this at all. I don't want to hear any more nonsense about doing the county council's job because the city already does lots of things for the county council concessionary fares for the elderly for example. On the city board last week we had yet another example rather a good project Trumpington disability project, very likely but it's social services budget. And a question you have to ask yourself is why the labour party is prepared to spend on all the aspects of county council responsibility except education. Why is this? Why does the labour party seem to education? The one thing it will not, it will not spend money on. Education is important to everyone, it's not a m a minority group, it's important to individuals for their own self fulfilment, it's important for society for our economic future and our future as a democracy. So why the opposition and after all this time, eighteen months of debate. And from the labour party, reason after reason, feeble reason after reason . After all this time reason and reason's been knocked down, one after the other and what did we get last time? We got votes against our proposals with no reasons given at all, you've now got down to the point of having no reasons at all for opposing what we want to do. So what is why is it that labour party oppose education spend? So I think we're getting rather strange signals out of tonight's budget, on the one hand we have councillor the John Smith clone, although at least put a bit of weight on. On the other hand We seem to have a labour party that treats education as some kind of middle class hobby that thinks of education spending as something spent only on the bourgeoisie, something to do with a university, something not really important for ordinary people. If that's not the reason, what is the reason? And one suspects it might be back in the days of the nineteen fifties, nineteen sixties when the labour party opposed anything at local level,of course, but at local level that might tend towards helping people to be upwardly mobile on the grounds that upwardly mobile people stop voting labour. I don't want to go to the story as to why the labour party opposed the er th the entry to the city of Marks and Spencer but it's an interest . They didn't want working people to have decent clothes . I really do hope the labour party is stuck in some kind of thirties plan I'm afraid I've got my doubts. Will you stop laughing. the circumstances I wonder how well this is to the current debate as opposed to amendments which I suspect will be moved later on. I'll give my reasons for voting against this budget. It's got no education spending. I I I think that councillor should be allowed to continue. because er he's just one person who remembers those years. Ooh. There are other grounds remaining for opposing this budget. It still hasn't tackled all the waste there is in the council, we'll get back to that when we amendment. It still hasn't done anything new, has no new ideas about traffic and environmental problems. And of course it's a budget which is on an attitude towards the Parkside Pool problem which we disagree with therefore in no way do we support it. But there are many reasons, as you will see when we put our amendment asking why are budget proposals are different from the ruling groups but the main reasons are simply the ruling group's refusal, for whatever reason, I just wanna hear the reasons. to do anything about the major problems facing the city. Councillor . Yes I would like also to speak against this amendment erm but for completely different reasons. I don't intend to give the council a to solving the world's problems and that's not the word to mind but problems. . Because I do recognise Mr Mayor er I have to say, that this amendment is a step in the right direction. But I believe that the councillor er is somewhat cynical in the what that he has put this forward. Tories producing rabbits out of hats is the big bad headline, wasn't it. You know we're the ones accused of doing these things at the last moment. We're the ones who you know, don't tell anybody what our strategy is going to be, we suddenly spring it on the members right at the end of the process at the council meeting. We're not running the council the labour group are running the council er but they on this occasion Mr Mayor, are the ones producing the rabbits out of the hats. And I'll congratulate the leader of the council on a wonderful conjuring act with this amendment. I asked at the meeting of the city board and I asked on more than one occasion, and didn't get a proper answer, what the labour group intended to do with the three point two million pounds that will build up in reserve say for the next three years. I made it clear that our policy was to use that money to reduce the level of the council tax over that period of time. I couldn't get any clear commitment er from er you Mr Mayor, or the leader of the council as to what would do with that three point two million pounds. I also pressed at the city board for something to be done about this problem of the er people disappearing off the poll tax register at an alarming rate I must add. And I was absolutely amazed and I think all of us on the opposition benches were absolutely amazed at the city board that you appeared to have no proposals whatsoever to do anything about that situation. I find found that absolutely incredible and I thought it was bizarre to say the least, the procedure we had to go through the other er evening erm with two hours of acrimonious debate er a break while you consulted er the officers before we got to some er sensible way forward which is now incorporated in this amendment er to spend a hundred thousand pounds on where's the box? In there. Oh I wanna keep that. Jockstrap. It's a good one this is. The one with the box. I'm not throwing that away. Right, put it in the box. And lift me the box up there. Right. Did something fall out?put it in then. I want you to the box. It's not easy. Here. Er it won't fit in. It won't come in! Take the white one out and Er it won't fit. I can't get it in. Never heard such rubbish. Should have seen me and mum in the loft then. Oh we must remember we've got christmas paper up there. Give us your box then and I'll put it . Totally bald. You look nice. I'm not. Don't think they've got any smell in them any more. No. No, they're a few years old them are. Put my weight training gloves up there. You should soak them in some stuff. That's right. John. Hey? You should soak them in some stuff. Is that ? You must have bought me that and I dropped it. Bought it you? Happy birthday Mary. Mm? Happy birthday. No I'm ever so thirsty. I don't know what the hell's the matter with me. I've been thirsty the past couple of days. I've gotta go and get a drink. Are they warm? Yeah. Right, lift the chair over the for me. You're not putting them in the car boot sale mum. Mm? Don't put them in the car boot sale. Do they still fit you mum? Mm? Do they still fit you? Put the kettle on? Mm? No I haven't, no. D what somebody s ask me to? No. Well what do you ask me if I put the kettle on for? Just thought you might have done. No I had a drink of erm squash. What about hey! Johnnie. We're looking through that Mary. They good quality? Mm. Yeah. or something. Yeah. They're a nice pattern. Nice pattern on them. That's about twenty years old. Yeah, nice ones. The lady that lived opposite me mum brought them down. Yeah. What wee Mary? Solid stainless steel. What does it say? Solid stainless steel, yeah. If it had said solid silver I'd have been down the h down the s down the high street . What's this anyway? Mm? What's that? It's an armband that you wear when somebody dies. To show that you're in mourning. You gonna save this purple wool? No, don't don't even know Yeah. what it is. Cos it's not elastic. purple wool. Soak them wooden balls. What for? Get the smell back. Soak them in some perfume and stuff. Oh perfume? Yeah. But does any erm What's that Mary? Just an empty box John but I'm probably keeping it for erm Scrap. Was it, did I buy you them? The dust that's in there. I won't get rid of this ski stuff, the goggles and things, no? No keep the goggles and that, yeah. Keep the ski stuff, yeah. Oh. I mean this ought to go in the paper really. What? Your camera? Put it down there on the floor please. This ought to go in the paper Mary, not boot not the car boot. Car boot, no way.

No, I think it's a brown one according to Mary it looked brown it brown one not so bad, I mean if it was erm if it was a grey one would of been a sewer rat! Oh! Coming up , which would have been more serious, maybe, cos it meant there might have been a break somewhere or We was on about rats the other day at work cos Jackie was saying on her way cos her husband works in ooh God! What's that place called? Erm Dad, what's that, where's that where's where's the M forty two go, right to Wigan at the M forty two. Down a bit, sort of like, it's going up er the M one innit?

Mm. It's as though they were on a family outing ! Yeah. She couldn't believe it! Then we got onto the subject, you know, the plague we a , we all reckon that it's gonna come back. I mean, Birmingham is over run with rats! They're everywhere! London's the same! That's the sewer rats. Awful isn't it! They just multiply in there's millions of them! Why don't they do something about it? And th , think they're having a real problem in Birmingham as well the they're, trying to get rid of them and they're down the sewers all the time trying to get rid of the bloody things! Cos they're coming up you see Yeah. See any crack in the drain or anything like that, all of their burrowing and they'll get through it! Mm. And that's what they're doing, they're coming into peoples gardens and rushing down the sewers again, you know? Mark's playing pool tonight. We went to erm a party on Saturday one of the men that he works with, it was his fiftieth birthday and of course fifty years ago was the war wasn't it, nineteen forty two? Yeah.

Yes I did. I thought I'll give him something to talk about at the garage. Yeah, I couldn't remember his name you know I know now, Colin yeah. I can remember Brian I couldn't remember Colin's name. He sat with us, him and his wife. They're a nice couple they're alright. They was telling, telling us about their son cos he's got erm a Nintendo game system, same as Mm. ours and apparently he's supposed to be brilliant on it! He knows all the short cuts and gets thousands and thousands of points on it! Mhm. I'm the highest I've got is a hundred thousand so far, Mark's up to two hundred and fifty thousand! Is he? Mind you, he plays it more than me ! It's entertaining though I mean I can understand why kids get addicted to them cos once you start, you can't stop yo you think Yeah. to yourself I'll do better next time and I'll do better next time and it's, it's all the time I must try harder next time! I mean a, I'm a little bit different cos I would, I'd you know me, I don't like putting money in anything cos I I don't like to to lose money through a a lost cause sort of thing. You twenty five Ded? Twenty eighty! Mm. I wish I was twenty five ! Well that's side A and get a couple done today it won't look so bad. So what's it for then? Get your coat on! Ay What's it for?

The girls I think Jo , Jean and George are coming down so Oh that'll be nice. if you wanna come out with us for a meal erm we're gonna go to The Fox. Oh yeah. And then we're going way up Chester, taking her up Chester. All pay for ourselves. Well I'll have to pay for Jean and George anyway. Well you don't have to pay for us though, don't worry about us. Erm I'll have to pay , cos I've got no money. Oh that's alright. So I'll put it Erm on my Access. We went out for Sunday lunch cos I don't work Sundays any more. Yeah, I know,, they're catching up are they or are pac , are they closed down? No, they just want the office closed. They don't wanna pay me you see! Who's, who's there to cash then? So nobody! What about ? They want in the office, I've gotta sort it out Monday. Take your time. Well we did. It's like erm yesterday I Don't get many figures. no yesterday we had er two, two tills one was fifty pound short and one was twenty pounds up! Well I found the twenty pound in the end but the fifty pound we couldn't find it, we checked everything so i fortunately I said to I had them re-checked on Monday during the day for cash up Mexicans, there were er Ce people from er Central America, South America, from everywhere. Now, given the different nationalities,wa wasn't there a communication problem? Language problem? Well, er er there there al there always is, isn't there? There is a there is but er er but er er the medium er er as best it could be used was was Spanish you see. See? And it's surprising the number of people er who do speak Spanish. You see, because everybody everybody from Mexico, right down to the er to the tip of South America, for example,er speak one dialect or another of er of er of of of of Spain, of the Spanish language, and large areas of er of er the Indes you see, er and Italian is not a long way from it, you see, so er er er it it on the surface it may seem to have have been difficult, but the er you know there we we we did get by. Did you manage by pick did you pick up a few words yourself? Ah, yes, just a few. Everybody managed by Yeah. doing that did they? Yeah, yeah. And er what what was the point, it was like a training camp as well was it? That's right, yeah. Now what what kind of er training did you get? Well er we got we got the use of er er of rifles, you know, there weren't many, because they were wanted er they were wanted at the er front. There were one or two rifles they were er, you know, . so we did indeed get some basic er basic military training. We fired rifles, and and and and and this and this sort of thing. Er, we did er you know practise military formations as they were as they were practised in er in those days and so on. So we did er we did indeed get some er basic military training. Erm what about your standard of living? What what kind of food did you get, and where were you living at the time? Er,well there was always a problem er food-wise, because there was a scarcity, there was a sc an overall scarcity er of food. Er er and the Spanish coast, you see, was blockaded. You see it was er whilst it was er er a democratically, legally elected government, you see there were such people as er er as Mussolini, from Italy, fascist Italy,and er er er Hitlerite Germany you see, who had got units, naval units, air units etcetera, blockaded. Blockaded the er er the ports of er of republican Spain. And consequently, er the blockade did have er did have serious er serious consequences for the imports in relation to food etcetera, that er that were required by the er by the republican government. So what sort of I remember there was one fellow, er an Englishman, he was known as Potato Jones. He used to he used to run his own ship, er a little coastal a little coastal er er vessel. Er, and he he used to run he used to run food to er the in er in this in this boat, a fellow named Potato Jones, I don't know why he was known as Potato Jones, Er was was he politically inclined, was he Er this I don't know, this I don't know, but er or was it a bit of opportunist entrepreneur ? Yeah. He was an he he was an he was a hero you see, er er er You don't know whether he did it from an entrepreneur's point of view, or from er No. Exactly why, he must have had some sympathy, mustn't he ? . Er now, And and and the food, on Yeah. the question of food Yeah, yeah. you see it was er er er it could have been er it could have been er better done, but er, we got by, we got by. What what exactly kind of meals did you have? What were they? Most of it most of it is most Rice is it? of it was soup. Most of it , Was it? most of it was soup. I was ever so sure that er that that there was a goodly number of er er er well there was a qu quite a substantial fall in the in the in the donkey population, er . er in Spain, because we reckoned it was only donkey that went in that went into the er burro as they call it , went into the went into the soup, you know with the beans and er er er various types of lentils and so on. And er the bread. The bread wasn't bad, the bread wasn't bad. Did you ever get any let up from that though? Did you ever have a decent meal ? Er n not really, you you may talk your way into some peasant's house, and er er he'd give you a scrambled egg or or something like this, and er that was something, if you got a scrambled egg. And what about oth other other supplies, I mean clothing, and cigarettes and that kind of thing, was that ? ? . Well, you had what you went in you see, er you may get a you may have got a a trench-coat, or a poncho, you know, er er sort of a big cloak, er but er uniform in the in the accepted military sense, er, no.. Mm. And what about cigarettes? Pardon? How about did you manage for them? Cigarettes? Well, er er a similar, er when you got a letter, when you got a letter,so you you'd probably get you'd probably get four or five Woodbines, you see, er things like this, and there was an issue from time to time, and they were chiefly American cigarettes, chiefly American cigarettes. Now, Perhaps once a week you'd get twenty of those, but er there there was a local tobacco, you know. But er, you'd got to be a man and a half to be able just to to smoke to smoke the local stuff.. Now how long were you were you at this er camp before you ? Oh er perhaps a couple of months. No longer. Now how how was the army itself organized, did you was it in the in the normal normal sense of the army Oh yes. or was it Yes, it was organized and it and er yes. There were companies, er and there'd be probably three companies to a battalion, something like this, depends on the arms, er and then er you'd get three or four battalions to er to a brigade, you see. But you had political commissars ? And we had political commissars, oh yes, yes . And what what sort of a role did they play, then? What did they do? Er, well,they had a difficult job, they had a difficult job you see, because they'd got to keep explaining to you why you hadn't got a rifle. And er and when you're fighting a war, you see and er and and and er and you haven't got a rifle, I mean it's a serious problem. So the political commissar has got to convince you, you see, as to who was responsible for you not having a rifle. Er in other words in other words,their task was one of er of holding, maintaining, you know,er a political enthusiasm,you know and er and er a political discipline, see? So when things aren't going very well, you see, the the the f these these are the chaps that's got to do, they've got to do the explaining. But er did they have er any other sort of job to do though? I mean did they you know deliver political speeches to try and . Oh yes, yes, yes. . This was their role, this was their role, you see. Erm and how did that go down well, did it er did it work in practice ? Well it more or less, it more or less it was accepted. . Because he's talking,he's he's talking to er er a fairly high er political level of understanding Mm. you see. Mm. And wh what happened then? Wh where did you go to anyway when you when you were sent to the front ? Oh well er I joined the er I joined the er British battalion, er er up the front, not far from a place called er . interesting, you said the British battalion,th y , in your own battalions you kept your own nationality. Oh yes, aha. So that language Yeah. Although for a time for a time, I was er I was with er er er an hotchpotch, mixed up outfit,wh which included er Americans, Canadians,er and British. But mainly but English speaking? Oh aye, yes, they were all English speaking , . oh yes, yeah. But anyway when y you were first sent with the British battalion to , was that?. Well then I went to the British battalion, Mm. not far . Erm did you have all your equipment by this time, then you did get a rifle ? More or less, more or less. Er, you'd never got er you'd never got enough er if you'd got a rifle, er you didn't have many rounds of ammunition, and things like this, you see. So there was never er there was never an an abundance of anything, as far as that went. Now were you involved in many battles? Not many. No. Er I was involved in the in the this battle that resulted in the breakthrough by the er by the er by Franco's fascists, at , er What what sort of things went on, erm was it close fighting or did you never see Yeah, it it got fairly close. Er it ought not to have done in so far that er we were we were we were we were moving, we were going forward to take up positions on er on the river, er and this was being done on the understanding that er a certain bridge had been destroyed,er and it hadn't been destroyed er and they were and they were they were already across you see. They were already our side, This is the nationalist army, yeah? and er they did indeed even have tanks across this side. Er and when you ain't got any tanks,, and he's got some tanks, your your your situation isn't it's it's not very it's not very healthy. They not only had tanks, they had er they had aircraft. In fact, in fact,tt it was a regular army division er from Italy that was doing this job. And so you as a sort of er volunteer army didn't have a lot of Well we you didn't have a lot of chance in these circumstances, in these circumstances when they when they possessed every every piece of modern equipment,or equipment that w was modern in those er in th in those er in those days, and you're not er Was there much ? you're not er er er more heavily armed than er than rifle, and the odd light machine gun. And er he's already he's already got you at a disadvantage,by er er you're on the move and he's waiting for you. Now,d was there much of a battle, or did you realize ? Yes, this went on, it went on for about er three days, it went on for three days. Er but er in the end er in the end they won. Obviously. They Mm. er the air force, the German air force, aye, they had a go as well, they they they they they they they were providing all sorts of er er strafing and bombing, er comma. And it's my contention, it's my contention that them people that were er strafing and bombing me, er outside , er in republican Spain, was the same was the same crowd was the same crowd that were bombing and strafing several years later, in the in in the second world war, in in in France er and Holland. Now, what happened to you then? Well, I was captured, And if we can just er just go back just for for one minute, just to draw a bit of before you were captured, er and whatnot, could you tell us just a little bit about the living conditions that you had when you were actually at the front. Well er aye. Well you j you just live rough, you li you live rough. Er and this particular time of the year, it was summer of course, you we you you weren't overly worried about not having a shelter, you see. You had reached the stage where you could er you could sleep out er and you didn't er er you didn't have a soft bed if er you were you were living rough. And of course er er i i I think it says something it says some thing for the morale, you see, that er and political understanding you see, that you can accept all these things, see, er er and still er and still carry on determined. Now what about your supplies, how did you manage with them? Er most of the supplies, food, was picked up er was picked up locally. Er er it seems we had a very good er er quartermaster, he seemed to always turn up er he seemed to always turn up with something. Er it seems it seems that the English are p pretty good at this sort of thing. And did you ever meet up with your friends from Nottingham at that time? Er, yes. Er Gregory, yes, I saw him. But Gregory, he came down to the er to the base, and then I went out, you see and er er he he was back at the base whil whil whilst this was going on. Although, although I would think that er Waldo Gregory has got the longest er time served in active service than probably er any other individual that went to Spain. he was in at the beginning and he was er he was there at the end, sort of thing . Mm. Er he suffered a couple of wounds as a ma as a matter of fact. Now er what happened once you'd been captured then? Where were you taken? Tt er well we had like I I say, we w we were i we were in the hands we were in the hands of the er Italian army, the er regular army from Italy, we were in their hands er for quite some time. Er there was some relief I should think about this, er er a bit of relief. But after a while, after a while we were handed over to the er Spanish fascist authorities, proper. Er er there was just the one meal a day and a piece of bread and that was your lot. But er after a while, Erm er th they so they treated you quite badly then? Pardon? They they didn't treat you very well? Not r no, not really. No. And di did they They they weren't against laying about you with sticks and stones and rifle butts for no reason at all. And did they pick on any individuals? Er oh yeah, they they would . pick on individuals. There was a a bloke named , er he w he he was er er an Irishman, who who had er a fairly high standing in the Irish er republican movement. Er they were they picked they picked er they picked on him. And as a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, the Germans th th th had thought that he would be of value to them at a later stage,because he was er he was shipped to Germany, and er er I understand that he died in Germany er at the latter end of er of of er of the of the war, the Second World War. Y er er th they they kept him there, they they I think they were hopeful, they were hopeful that he being a republican from Ireland, that er he he c he c he could have been used, you know by the Nazis in er in their general propaganda, directed to Britain er with a Irish er slant on the situation, but er it's quite clear that er that they were never able to use . er er er wouldn't be used, because er he was never heard he was never he was heard,he was never heard, erm similar to this Lord Haw-Haw, you know that used to do the broadcasting er from from Nazi Germany to er to to to Britain, particularly to England. But anyway, he he died almost as a prisoner at er at towards the end of er o er er of the Second World War. Er and they did indeed, they picked er they picked on him. Er but this er that was a that was a er decision of the er er of the German command, of the German army that was in Spain. But after the war,w we went back er under the er under the control of the Italian army. Okay so last week we looked at the participatory model of democracy which in essence of Russo's Theory in three ways. First of all, it allows much more room for debate, discussion, dissension, even disobedience in Russo's Theory. a consequence of giving up the assumption that there's at least an easily recognizable general will. So either you say there's no general will or there is something like a general will, but it is not easily recognizable and for either reason you would want to be much more tolerant of the role minorities, either as a way of getting to the truth, or erm as a way of as it were making up the truth as you're going along. So that's the first difference between participatory model and Russo's model there's much more room for debate and consequent toleration of minority. Secondly, it gives up the distinction between sovereign and the executive in the sense that the people are not restricted only to making laws, but they can also get involved in decisions about particular acts of will. So for example, er on Russo's model we saw the people are not consultive on the issue of whether the State should go to war or not, because that's a particular act and must be left to the executive. In the participatory democracy the people would certainly decide that . The third difference was that the participatory model and it is perhaps the most distinctive about it, extends democracy to other institutions of civil society, including the family, the workplace, local governments and so on. Now I discussed three objections to the participatory model last week. The first one is John Stuart Mill's objection which is that we can't leave everything to the people. At some point individuals must administer, you can't have a committee carrying out the committee. You must need some individual point by that committee and the same is true for governments. So it is not possible, not practically possible to leave everything to the people. We'll come back to that objection. The second objection was the problem of agenda setting in a participatory democracy. How is it that the people come to be discussing certain issues rather than other issues? How do those issues get decided and I thought there's no sensible answer. Thirdly there's the old objection of participatory democracy that it simply takes up too much time and this is not a trivial objection, because the thought is not that it's simply time-consuming, but because it's so time-consuming, it's destructive of other things we value so that we value er artistic creation, enjoyment, conversation and so on. These things, there would simply be no time left for erm in political decision making. Okay, so much for last week. This week I want to start by reconsidering that first objection but we can't leave everything to the people. At some point we need administrators to carry out the will of the people. Now the defenders of participatory democracy would consider this as a very weak objection. What they would say is that we have to, perhaps we do have to leave things to the individual, but we should leave as little possible to individuals, as little as practically possible so that we should the people involved in making all the important decisions, particularly the carrying out of them that we have to leave to particular appointed individuals. So erm we can cast this in a different context. We've got really two things in play here, one is the role of individuals who administer and the other is the role of the people, so we have a question of what is the proper role of the people and what is the proper role of the individual administrators. We've seen the answers from participatory democracy as little as possible to the individuals as much as possible to the people. At the other extreme we have something like Plato's system, where the people are given no role at all and everything is left to individual experts, individual administrators, so Plato's system is at one everything is left to the individuals, participatory democracy as little as possible is left to individuals. Somewhere in the middle we have Russo's system where the people make laws but no do nothing else everything else is left to appointed individuals. There's a fourth possibility that we haven't looked at yet and this is a possibility of representative government where the people simply elect lawmakers, the people don't make laws they elect the people to make laws. So in this case the people who carry out the will of the people make the laws on behalf of the people. So representative government gives some role to the will of the people, some role to the individual to individuals, but erm in a way less role to the will of the people than participatory democracy or Russo All the individuals do is elect their governors, so this is the idea that Russo called not democracy but that to of aristocracy. We vote in a group of people who then in this view, Mill's view take laws on our behalf. They also appoint administrators to carry out those laws. So this is a much more familiar model of democracy to us than any of the others that we've seen so far and for Mill, representative democracy was the only way democracy could survive in the modern world. He particularly was concerned about problems of scale as a practical problem, that is it may well be in a small town you could have a direct democracy, a face-to-face community where people can talk to each other and argue with each other and meet on a regular basis, but as soon as you get cities, countries, nations,direct democracy of any sort is erm absurd Well and we have seen one response for people now making Mill that is that his objections are not being finessed by computer technology, they don't want to get back into that type of argument, because this is really not the most important argument against direct democracy. To understand Mill's view or at least to see why Mill makes the argument he does make, er I E not just the argument but other arguments which represent democracy. We have to understand first of all what Mill thinks the proper function of government and in his view governments have two roles. There are two things that governments ought to be doing. Firstly they ought to improve the citizens, both morally and intellectually, so it's the role of the government to make better citizens. Secondly they have to manage the affairs of government well, or rather erm, so they have to manage the affairs of the state. What does this second claim come to what is its state of the affairs of the state well, well we should assume that Mill ultimately utilitarian standard so that erm to manage the state's affairs well is to maximize general happiness. However, it's surprising that in on representative government utilitarianism barely surfaces and that almost no mention at all is made of utility apart from in a very general way. However erm so two things to say about that, I think we can assume will ultimately apply utilitarian standard, but he doesn't make much of it here and he relies on a much more intuitive idea of what manage things well and he assumes that different branches of government will have different standards of success and that we will be able to tell pretty much whether they're doing well or badly. Now this is rather a banal claim I suppose that erm the proper function of government is to manage things well, I mean who would have doubted that, but the other claim that governments, one of the roles of governments is to improve the citizens is more surprising, particularly for a liberal view and there's a more standard liberal position now would be that the moral well-being citizens is not a proper matter of governmental concern. Or they should, the citizens should be er stopped from er attacking each other and so on, but whether the citizens turn out to be morally good or morally bad in other ways in private matters, whether they're morally improving or not, is simply not the business of governments. It is surprising to hear that Mill doesn't hold this view that he thinks that erm the moral health of the citizens is of concern to the government and it actually gives, although he doesn't seem to recognize this, this gives a hostage to fortune to his conservative critics because of course they can say, did say that liberalism was very damaging of er morality of the public and so we need a far more restrictive type of regime than Mill allows us. And anyway I'm going to leave that on one side now because it's more erm a problem to reconciling Mill's views about liberty with his views about a proper government rather than directly about governments, so I'm just going to note that and move on now. Okay well suppose that erm Mill is right that these are the two proper functions of government. Given that he thinks he can demonstrate, easily demonstrate the advantages of representative governments to show why is far better than any alternative. First of all he contrasts representative democracy with what he calls enlightened despotism which is really something like places guardianship. Now Mill concedes that the guardian, the despots might manage the affairs of the state tolerably well that there's no reason of principle why a very enlightened despot couldn't do fairly well, although Mill claims that no despot could do as well as a good democracy. I found it hard to find Mill's arguments for this, although he seems to be, he seems to be arguing the point over several pages, but erm we get pretty much rhetorical claims and evidence and so he wants us to consider those states which have been ruled by despots with those contemporary states which have been democracies England versus Spain say and he thinks it's obvious which type of system we ought to prefer. But he's got no, as far as I can see he's got no convincing argument that democracy will do better, but that doesn't matter because he thinks that the decisive criticism of enlightened despotism is that it won't improve the moral or intellectual well-being of the citizens, but if people are excluded from political decision making, they will have no incentive to educate themselves or morally improve themselves, or he thinks if they do, if a despot does allow for the moral improvement of the citizens, then citizens will no longer accept despotism so that despotism is in a way self-defeating here and if it one of the proper functions of government it can't survive. No morally and intellectually well educated people will be prepared to tolerate despotism rather than democracy. So that's Mill's argument against enlightened despotism. More interesting is his implicit comparison with direct democracy. Now he doesn't actually make the concession I think it's consistent of what he says, that he ought to concede that direct democracy might be better at improving the citizens, because after all the citizens have much more to do on in service of the state but his view is that direct democracy has the opposite failure to guardianship, that while it might be better at improving citizens it's absolutely hopeless in managing the affairs of the state and his reasons for that is that we need experts with experience in order to carry out the affairs of government and although these people ought ultimately to be held responsible to the people, people shouldn't sit in judgment them in every one of their decisions. So here he has erm quite a long discussion in the fact that if you have inexperienced people, they will often make the make a quick initial assessment of a situation which is being and rejected by a more experienced person. So the experienced person will always be able to take the inexperienced person, it's not as simple as that, but if you make the administrators responsible to the people in all their decisions, then you have as Mill says inexperience sitting in judgment on experience, ignorance sitting in judgment on knowledge. So you have to insulate the, the administrators from direct control of the people if you, if the administrators are going to make good decisions. The people just have to trust the administrators at a certain point, rather than trying to er second guess all of their decisions. So a direct democracy will lead to a very inefficient running of the state. Therefore representative democracy presents itself as the best compromise. It can manage the affairs of the state very well and it can improve the citizens. Well how does it do that? Why does representative democracy improve the citizens? Because after all critics will say if representative democracy isn't the best practical realization of democracy but simply a sham, after all remember Russo's comments on England, the people of England think they're free but they're mistaken, they're free once every five years when they elect their rulers. Now Russo then representative democracy isn't a refinement of democracy to make it appropriate for the modern world, but a way of giving away all the merits of democracy. Now Mill accepts that representative democracy can be as bad as Russo supposes it is, but there are aspects of Mill's views which make him sound very much like Russo as well. For Mill it's very important that citizens are educated for their role and although participation on a na national level has to be something that can be restricted only to the few, Mill nevertheless wants active participation of the citizens in other aspects. So for example he's Mill is very keen on the idea of local participation, that everyone should at some point in their lives play a role in local government in some level. Also he speaks very much in favour of jury service that he thinks that everyone is liable to jury service has a number of advantages. One is that it makes people er it gives people experience of participation which is itself an improving matter. It makes people consider issues from an impartial moral point of view. Also it helps one in practice for voting. So jury service he thinks is a terrific way of improving the jurors. He doesn't defend it as the best way of getting the correct decision, he doesn't defend it, or he doesn't solely defend it that way he doesn't defend it either on the idea that people have right to be tried by their peers for example which is the most likely defence now, but he defends jury service on the grounds of the effect it has on the jurors which is quite a novel erm . In fact there's been some discussion of this lately, John Elston has argued that if jurors knew that that's why they were chosen to go on the jury, it would destabilize the princi the practice of it because if you knew you were going on jury just for self-education rather than to get the right results out the other end, then this wouldn't give you any way of motivating yourself properly for the jury. Well, I'm not sure that's correct, but anyway Mill thinks that these ideas local participation of jury service are ways of getting people involved at the highest practical level of participation. So in other words, Mill accepts the arguments of Russo the arguments of the participatory er theorists that participation in government, participation in public affairs is a good thing, people should be encouraged to participate and it has an improving effect. The worry is, is if we allow participation above a certain level, this will lead to gross inefficiencies in a governmental process. So there's a maximum level of participation societies like ours. He thinks this is an question but in small societies may be a much higher level of democratic erm intervention at all levels would be possible, but it's only in modern societies that participation on a very extensive scale becomes absolutely impossible. Okay so this is a rough sketch of the basic outlines, now let's try and fill in a bit more details. One question that we raised a number of times is when people vote in this democracy, what should they be doing? Should they be voting in their own interests, or should be they be voting out of their view of what is right, what is the good? It's normally thought that within the utilitarian tradition people should be required to vote on their interests. Because after all the right decision is to find in terms of general happiness and so you would have thought that voting was the best way of finding out where their general happiness lies. So there'd be something rather odd about people voting out of moral motivation for a utilitarian because they would be voting their estimate of where the general happiness lies, rather than putting their input into the sum from which someone else can calculate where the general happiness lies. So it's normally thought that within the utilitarian tradition, voters are required to vote their interests and then the democratic procedure tells us where the general happiness lies roughly speaking. But Mill doesn't argue this way, Mill argues that erm allowing people to vote their interests is corrupting of them. If people are voting in their interests, why not then sell their votes to the highest bidder? They have no obligation to use it responsibly if their, if they can use their vote selfishly. Rather he thinks that people ought to vote on the basis of what they think is right so he uses an with the jury service at this point. He thinks that justice jurors should put their personal interest to one side. So should voters, it would be rather absurd I think, well Mill thinks, that if jurors were expected to come to a decision on the basis of what they would prefer, would you prefer this person to be sent down or would you prefer them to get off. That's not the question, the question is is it right for this person to be found guilty, is it right for this person to be found innocent? Mill thinks that voting is to be ideally modelled on this er jury service idea so that's another reason why jury service is so important for all citizens. All citizens need a highly concentrated er episode in their lives where all they do is think about what is right in the circumstances and this will give them good practice, good training to being an enlightened voter. Again I'll come back to this point about motivation because it's very important later on. So erm this is Mill's counter-motivation. He also realizes that there are certain threats or problems with democracy. Some of these we've considered before but I'll tell you how Mill feels on them. One of them, this is not the first in the but one of them is that democracy may well throw up unworthy rulers. This is the point erm, well Plato made the point that the people we most want to rule us are probably the ones that are the least likely to want to take on that duty and Ben Williams made the same point the other way round that the people who rise to the top in politics are likely to be the ones that we would least like to have governing us. So I think I made this point before that the people who are right at the top of politics are the ones who are very good at flattery, duplicity, manipulation and so on and these, are these really the qualities we want in our government? So, Mill thinks we need erm Thanks. Mill thinks we need certain safeguards to make sure that unworthy rulers don't present themselves. One thing he says which is erm a current topic is that we should limit the election expenses of any candidate. His thought is that how can we trust anyone who's prepared to pay their own money to get elected? If someone is going to put off a lot of their own money in order to get into parliament, we can, then we can hardly trust them to look to the general interests once they're there, they'll want a return on their investment of some sorts. So anyone who's putting up a lot of their own money is untrustworthy and there should be limitation on how much people can stand, erm Mill actually goes into some figures at this point and rather quaintly says erm either fifty pounds or a hundred pounds ought to be adequate and I don't know what that translates to now. Erm, so there should be a limitation of election expenses. In fact makes the claim that election expenses ought to be met from the public purse rather than the private purse of the candidates tax revenues and I should think Mill would be happy with that idea. Although erm his second idea second way of limiting the possibilities on is rather more difficult to accept now and his claim is that we shouldn't pay members of parliament, that people who go to parliament ought to be doing it out of duty and not out of er interest. What he says is that erm you know when he was writing of six hundred and fifty eight seats in parliament, I don't know how many there are now, but he says if we allowed for people to be paid, then we have as it were six hundred and fifty eight prizes to people's six hundred and fifty eight jobs for people and he says and this is rather astonishing to hear, to read this is that it will attract adventurism of low class to er parliament if we pay members of parliament. Well what about those people who are morally worthy, I take it when he says low class, he doesn't mean low moral class, but mean low social class as well he probably means both things actually. What about those people of a low social class who are of a high moral class, what about them? Well he gives the example of a contemporary member of parliament, Mister Andrew Marvel who apparently was erm, because members of parliament were not paid at this time, he was sponsored by his constituents, so they subscribed to a he was so good they managed to subscribe to and he thinks that this is the ideal solution, if someone is really worthwhile, then their constituents would be happy to pay their salary directly, rather than, than have salaried jobs. Okay so this strikes us as a rather eccentric claim er he does qualify it, he says that there may be cases where there aren't enough people of independent means in a country to present themselves, he doesn't mean England here he means some of the dependent territories and then members of parliament should be paid compensation rather than a salary. So in other words they should be paid the salaries they would have been got getting in whatever their other line of work would have been, rather than special rates of the job of an M P. I mean it may well be that we have in this country we have erm pretty much Mill's system because MPs get paid relatively little bearing in mind what most of them could be getting elsewhere, so maybe we've got something like Mill's system but it strikes us as rather a bizarre suggestion that MPs shouldn't be paid to prevent adventurous and lower classes becoming MPs. Okay so we have safeguards against unworthy rulers, much more important though Mill is worried about people voting on the wrong motives. So I've said before that erm Mill wants people to vote just in the same way that people cast their votes in a jury on the basis of what's right. He realizes that they can't, people can't be guaranteed to do this and he points out there are four different motivations that people might have that conflict with the er moral motivations. First of all there's personal interest, secondly there's class interest thirdly there's rather amusingly some mean feeling in his own mind, so he has the idea that people might just be rather grumpy or something when they're going to cast their, their vote and go to some rather destructive policy. I suppose you might think in a case now you might think that er er certain people aren't entitled to welfare benefits or something that and vote for the parties that excludes them, but that mean the sort of thing he he doesn't make much of that. Fourthly erm there's the problem of coercion that is some people might be forced to cast their vote one way or another or feel they're forced to cast a vote one way or another erm which is something we are less erm familiar with. The reason why we're less familiar with that is that we have a secret ballot and so there is no way of knowing how someone has cast their vote, and so there's no way of effectively forcing someone to cast their vote one way or another. However, Mill was against a secret ballot, Mill thought votes ought to be cast publicly and the reason for this is that he thought people ought to be voting on their view of what is right and so therefore they ought to be publicly accountable. People are much less likely to vote in their own interests, much less likely to vote in their class interests if other people know how they're voting. Mill also thinks this is a very good way of introducing female suffrage at this point which he is very much in favour of, if you had a, if you had a vote on it should if you vote if er there was a vote among the male electors about whether women should be given the vote and there was a public ballot, then it's very unlikely they would vote against the extension of franchise because their wives and daughters would be able to see what they've done, so he thinks that erm the only reason for having a secret ballot is that you're rather ashamed of what you're doing and that if you have a public ballot people will vote much more responsibly. Now Mill realizes that the objection to this is the last problem coercion, that if people's votes are known, then some people might be able to put pressure on others to vote one way rather than another and as I said why the secret ballot was brought in in the first place. For Mill's view is that coercion is now less of a worry than people voting on their class interest or their personal interest. Er here erm you can form your own views about whether Mill's right or wrong, I mean that the situation of a secret ballot was brought in to erm overcome as one where the local industrist industrialist who employed half the member of the town was also standing for parliament. Now erm in this case would your job be safe if your vote was known and you didn't vote for your boss? I mean it seems to me in those cases a secret ballot is highly desirable and coercion would be more of a danger than people voting er from the mo wrong moral motivation. But it might just be that we can't have both and we can't ensure that people vote from the right from moral motivation rather than personal interest and we can't ensure vote on coercion erm at the same time so perhaps other remedies are necessary. Now the other remedies have is one which is rather distinct of Mill that he thinks that erm of all of these forced motivations class interest is the most damaging and he argues there's a remedy for this, we'll see why it's a remedy in a minute, that certain people ought to be given more than one vote so that although everyone should have some votes, not everyone should have the same number of votes. In particular he thinks the educated should have at least two votes, he doesn't say how many erm that's a matter determined case-by-case I take it, erm erratically it could be a thousand votes I mean he doesn't rule that out, he doesn't say it has to be more than one er two, but erm his view is that the educated to a specially privileged in a specially privileged position because they are erm more able to use their vote sensibly or to be given more than one vote, so we need now there's going to be a question erm how do you know who the educated people are to make such suggestions, anyone with a university degree will be pleased to hear gets more than one vote on Mill's system. Anyone who enters the liberal profession so accountancy, medical and so on erm he made some other suggestions which we'll look at shortly. But there is something of a tension in Mill's view, because he thinks that erm it's very important that if there is plural voting then the people who only have one vote should be prepared to accept the situation, so that the reasons why these people are given extra votes should be reasoned that the public, the uneducated accept past critics have pointed out if that's going to be the case, why is it necessary to give these people extra votes, give the educated actual votes, because if the uneducated accept that the decisions of the educated are worth more than their own decisions, the opinions of the educated are worth more than the opinions of the uneducated, if they really do accept that, what's to stop them just following the decisions of the educated in their own vote? Why not simply take advice? So there's no reason why these people should be given more votes rather their superior status can be recognized by giving them more informal influence. I was actually astonished to find Mill making exactly this argument against another proposal in erm a later chapter because he considers a possibility and some people have put forward the view apparently, I haven't heard of this, erm in the version that Mill discusses, that the two stage action where we vote for people who then go to vote for the members of parliament so the individual people don't vote directly for members of parliament but they vote for people who then have elections an election among themselves. This is rather like the American system of presidential elections except that in the American system, the people who are voted for are tied to a particular candidate, so it's really just erm a convoluted way of having a direct system rather than a genuinely indirect system here. But Mill considers what, what reasons could there possibly be for having this two stage process. The arguments given in favour is that we vote for the wise and then the wise go on to make a proper final decision about who's best. Mill says exactly what I just said in response of him that is if the people are prepared to accept these why what's to stop them consulting and asking for advice about how they should cast their vote and so Mill later on gives a response to his own suggestion about plural voting in effect without realizing that what he's done. Anyway that's not important, the important thing is that he makes this, this idea that the educated should be erm given plural votes, in order to protect democracy being distorted by class interest. Now the most important threat to democracy and the way in which class interest may establish itself is Mill thinks through stupidity and this is the most er challenging threat to democracy. The, the, the numerical majority he says may just not have the intelligence to make the right decisions and what he's particularly concerned about is that the uneducated poor who he calls the numerical majority will vote to equalize property. Now his argument against this is not that actual right to property, but it's actually against the interests of the uneducated poor to equalize property if property is equalized then the economy will so he uses some sort of incentive argument here and maybe some sort of undertones here that inequalities are necessary to make the worse off better off than they would have been without them, but he thinks the uneducated poor may well be too stupid to understand this so they may go to their immediate selfish interest rather than their long-term interest. There's a further point that the effects of the policy may not strike in the first generation anyway, it may be long-term before er equalization of property has the effect and other things so these people might, might vote in their own class interest against the interest of future generations. Now Mill seems to be very unsure what to do about this because he doesn't want to say that the poor should be disenfranchised, because after all everyone is entitled to their say in government, but he does seem to be worried that if the poor are given an equal say or the uned uneducated poor are given an equal say, then they will make a very bad decision, a decision which is against their own interests and this is one reason why he favours plural voting because he recognizes that the numerical majority might make a erm wrong decision, so we should make sure that the numerical majority don't have sway in a democratic process by giving another client more weight in it so he seems to between wanting to disenfranchise them altogether which he seems to consider and just emasculating their vote by giving other people more votes. In fact one thing he says er which might make you doubt his motives somewhat is that the reason for giving people more than one vote is that they're more educated, but in general there is also a rough correlation between property ownership and education and so there's a good reason to give the property owners more than one vote, people who own a lot of property more than one vote. Now he says that someone who doesn't hold much property can prove that they're educated they should get the extra votes too, but you don't seem, you don't have to prove that you're er educated if you're rich you just get the votes anyway because that's a good . Now actually Mill did put the his erm this proposal forward, he was a member of parliament for a few years and he was trying to get this discussed in parliament. No one seemed very interested in it. Well what this springs up is the issue, one of the issues we started with which is democracy in the tyranny of the majority is what Mill recognizes is is that a maj well he claims to be concerned that the majority will make a decision which is against the interests of everyone, but he's equally concerned about the issue that the majority might make a decision which is against the interests just of a picked-on minority, people with unpopular views, people who hold er members of a different religion and so on. So erm Mill wants to protect minority from within the democratic procedure, that is he wants to set up erm a system of democracy which is as it were proof against majority corruption. One way in which he does that he thinks is by plural voting, that you give the educated more than one vote, he says we have to make sure the educated don't form their own class with their own class interests, but, but giving the educated a bigger say will lead us to make better decisions he thinks. But he also endorses a very elaborate system of proportional representation with a single-transferable vote erm this is in the chapter called voting erm it seems to me actually his system is incoherent, but he doesn't think that, I mean he argues very strongly in favour of it and various it. His idea is that you can vote if if the voter in your constit if a person you vote for in your own constituency loses, you can then switch your vote to anyone else in the country and erm you can have a list of maybe ten or twenty people and erm you will so you'll hand in your ballot paper with all these names on, signed ballot paper because it has to be public you can hand in your signed ballot paper with all these names on and if your own candidate loses, then er your vote goes to your second person and if that person loses it goes to the third and so on. The incoherence I think is that you can't ever say that anyone has lost because you don't know what's happening in the second and third and fourth erm batch, so I can't see how this system is meant to work, Mill seems to be fairly confident that it will. So he has an interesting idea that we can set up democratic procedures to protect the minority within those procedures so that tyranny of the majority is something that afflicts only certain types of democracies, but if we have other types of democracies then we can protect the minority and the idea for proportional representation is often claimed in this light, but actually it doesn't work as an idea, because although it allows a minority to be represented,represented is a different from being protected and so even if there's a member of parliament with the one member of parliament with your unpopular views, that doesn't mean that your unpopular views won't be made illegal say, because the fact that there's one member of parliament won't mean that so his procedure doesn't work. There are other ways people have tried to protect the minority, one is by saying that the, that you can generate a certain set of rights from within the democratic procedure in a different way, that is if democracies flourish people need certain liberties, people need to express their own opinions, people need to be able to do what erm assemble where they need to and so on but more common is the view that democracy should be limited by constitutional would present the minority and this is a view that Mill doesn't really defend in representative government although it seems to be very close to his view and on liberty, that is we limit the spear that this government has control over so we can't, so in this view erm democracy is given a very limited role. It's very interesting to note that in contemporary political philosophy there is almost no room left for democratic decision making because in most theories that we're given, more or less everything is already decided at a constitutional level I mean think of theory of justice, it's the theory of justice that decides the basic nature of a constitution so the role of members of a government is simply to interpret and apply the constitution so they can make the most efficient tax policies given the basic constitution, but no individual has the authority to challenge that constitution and change it by democratic means. To it's even worse I mean there, there doesn't even seem to be a government in the there's just a police force and an army and no one making political decisions, so it's a peculiarity of recent political philosophy there seems to be no room left for the democratic process to do much apart from administer, so the democracy is given a very minor role. Okay so I think that erm some of Mill's system he has given us and accounted them a type of theory of democracy but seems to me deeply by between two ideas, one is that everyone will have a say in government and the other is they shouldn't be allowed decisive say if they are going to say the wrong thing so that on the one hand we have democratic equality of a source, on the other hand we have an independent theory of the good and a democratic process should be allowed to disrupt the good of the nation and Mill just doesn't seem to be able to put these two elements in erm proper coherent fashion. So what should we conclude about our own system on the well we do have a representative democracy here, it's very unlike Mill's recommended scheme. We have no idea what people are meant are meant to be doing when they're voting, this was a problem I raised are people meant to be expressing their interest, are people meant to be voting like members of a jury? We're not told and it doesn't say on your ballot paper please be sure to remember you're voting on what you think is right rather than what is in your personal interest, you were just asked to vote. So how can we defend the system that we've got? Well, it seems that none of the arguments that have been used so far would come close to defending the type of system that we've got. Now critics of contemporary systems say so much for the worse for contemporary system, we have to move to one of the other models, maybe suitably amended and only then will we be truly free and equal. The best I think we can say about our scheme is something that Brian Barry argues. It's in a paper I didn't put on the reading list because most of it is not relevant, it's called Is Democracy Special? and this in his collective papers. What Barry says is simply this that suppose we accept the point that split between the er er the powers of er the quadruple and then the er quintsimple erm er alliance. I'm referring obviously to the quadruple alliance of eighteen er er fifteen. Okay perhaps we can er er wrap a few things up on the erm on the er Vienna er settlement and the congress system itself. What actually happened in Belgium? Belgium became independent. Sorry yeah. Belgium became independent. Erm it's ind , it's independence was recognized fully by all the major European powers by eighteen thirty nine. It was regarded as erm it was one of Palmerston's, one of Palmerston's great triumphs wasn't it? Isn't it the case that Palmerston when he was on his death bed had the clause to the Belgian treaty read to him to cheer him up. Okay erm let's perhaps make a few comments then about the Vienna settlement itself. The old er the old kind of chestnut question is was it a success or a failure? I I I'd say with the, with the revamped exam you're not likely, you're not likely to get a question like that. Was Vienna successful? But you're gonna get a much wider question if it comes up on this and erm perhaps in incorporating the congress system but let's approach it from that, that perspective anyway. I think the best way of looking at this is to kind of take an open-ended version of what the Vienna settlement is all about. Er not just the treaty in eighteen fifteen but the whole congress system erm after eighteen fifteen onwards and into the eighteen twenties and such like. Erm I suppose the er the classic interpretation of the er the Vienna settlements is that erm in in the nineteenth century was that it was a failure and there was a, there was a kind of er consensus beginning quite early actually. There's a kind of consensus view that in the language of ten sixty six and all that the Vienna settlement was a bad thing. Erm and I say this view is, is in some respects being er erm er expressed relatively early on. Erm and you even get it associated with leading rulers or states er statesmen of the day. For instance erm somebody like Napoleon the Third. He emerged as president of France as Prince Louis Napoleon in eighteen forty eight and he er he erm achieves power by coup d'etat and becomes emperor in eighteen fifty two. Napoleon the Third is someone who's er who sees it as one of his objectives to undo the Vienna settlement. Erm and you've got other leading figures of the day. Count Cavor prime minister of Piedmont in eighteen er fifty. Erm and someone who's described as perhaps one of the architects of Italian unity. He becomes the prime minister of of a relatively united Italy erm in eighteen er eighteen sixty. Cavor is someone who's er Right. Cavor is someone who's hostile er to the Vienna settlement. Let alone of course large numbers of liberal stroke nationalist erm revolutionaries within Europe in the eighteen er twenties, thirties and forties. The various national secret societies and various nationalist movements like er Young Italy and there's even one called Young Europe which is kind of a pretty, pretty much catch-all one. But the various nationalist societies or the revolutionary purpose. They're all hostile to the Vienna settlement. And that perhaps er having mentioned the nationalist erm societies this perhaps gives us a clue to it. The the view was taken that the Vienna settlement was hostile to liberalism and nationalism. That was the view taken that the Vienna settlement was hostile to liberalism. It was hostile to nationalism. And therefore it was wrong because the argument goes that liberalism and nationalism are the great triumphant er ideologies of the nineteenth century and the Vienna settlement's not only wrong, but it was historically erm in a sense doomed because it was trying to oppose the growing erm unstoppable er ideologies of er erm of er of Europe. By the way erm it's always rather amusing when you see in the old history books the er the idea that erm that, to give an example, somebody like Metternich. You get the old idea that Metternich ignored liberalism and nationalism. Erm that's a very, a very misleading way of putting it. Metternich in many ways thought of little else except liberalism and nationalism. The Vienna settlement didn't ignore liberalism and nationalism. It tried its best to clobber it. It tried its best to actually er suppress it. And don't forget erm perhaps we ought to say a word on the er on the conservative's side here. Erm don't forget it's people like Metternich and indeed Castlereagh and the other erm er figures at the Vienna settlement. They were looking back in eighteen fifteen at twenty odd years of war and revolution. And if that was you know you could, I supp , you could argue that the French revolution had been built on notions of liberalism and it had encouraged nationalism in Europe. And therefore you could associate liberalism and nationalism with war, terror erm and perhaps therefore it wasn't all that desirable. Obviously as well in Metternich's er er, in Metternich's case nationalism would be the end of the Austrian empire. Because the Austrian empire, the Habsburg empire was a conglomeration of large numbers of different nationalities. Nationalism affected other great powers as well. Erm Russia Russia in eighteen fifteen grabbed Poland. Prussia had, still had chunks of Polish territory little bits of it. Prussia of course more especially more especially Prussia feared a united Germany. If you brought, if you got a united Germany then Prussia would simply be a small part of that united Germany. So it's important to note that nationalism the prospect of nationalism was seen as undesirable by the er major European powers. It didn't nationalism had no erm wouldn't affect France as such. Didn't affect Britain. Well it affected Ireland. There was always the problem of Ireland. I think it's a bit wrong perhaps to say it didn't affect Britain. Perhaps it didn't affect Britain at this time. But as we know from British history one of the understated reasons why erm there was a lot of hostility to home rule for Ireland in Britain was because of the fear of the creation of a hostile state er erm off, off Britain's shore. Erm so that's one aspect of Vienna. It was seen as being opposed to liberalism, as opposed to nationalism and perhaps there were, there were er, there were, there were good reasons er for that. By the way erm are we relatively clear what's meant by liberalism and nationalism within this context? Should I perhaps digress and say a little word erm er about this? Perhaps I will. It's perhaps of some interest to us that erm these to great -isms, liberalism and nationalism I think we can see them as products of the French revolution. Or indeed products of perhaps enlightened attitudes, certainly with the case of liberalism. In a sense, if we think of the context of say the late eighteenth early nineteenth century perhaps more, perhaps more specifically we think of the er, of the er erm early nineteenth century. Liberalism and nationalism are seen as two sides of the same coin. They were seen as inextricably bound up. Erm all liberals were nationalists. And to er, I suppose by and large, vice versa as well. Erm as I've said the er the the two er known as the two -isms. The two ideologies are by and large products of the revolution or in the case of liberalism perhaps of the of enlightened attitudes. By liberalism liberalism meant a number of things. It meant primarily constitutional government. It meant primarily constitutional government. Written constitutional government. Liberalism. Oh. It meant by and large constitut , it meant, it meant primarily rather constitutional government. Liberals would look to for instance the con the United States' Constitution. They would look to the er er to the constitution of of of France in say seventeen ninety one or the more radicals amongst them would look erm the more er the more radical liberal if that's not er, if that's not a, not a contradiction in terms, don't think it is. They would look to the constitution of eighteen, of seventeen ninety three. Others, other in nineteenth century Europe looked to the constitutions granted in eighteen twelve for instance in Spain and in Naples. These aren't er er er they tend to be a bit ignored in history, these. But they're of interest. In eighteen, in in late eighteen twelve erm with the prospect perhaps of Napoleonic rule in difficulties you see in some of Napoleon's, some of the client states of Napoleonic Europe Spain, Naples you see constitutions being granted which are are pretty democratic actually. And th the they're looked to by er European liberals as as model constitutions. When you get a revolt in Spain in the eighteen twenties. What is the revolt in favour of? The revolt is in favour of the constitution of eighteen twelve. So they believe in constitutional governments. Erm now obviously in the context of constitutional governments it's not, one can imagine having a constitutional form of government without, without a parliamentary system but erm it's perhaps a bit of a stretch of the imagination. But they mean by, erm constitutional government they also er er liberals also believed in the notion of parliamentary government. It's very much connected to late enlightenment notions that the only valid government would be representative government. Other forms of government are in a sense illegitimate. Absolute rule. Monarchical rule. Well not necessarily, I mean, unless the monarch was was was er, was part of the constitutional set up. But representative government was the only really legitimate form of government. Of course, there was debate amongst liberals on how much representation there would be. Or to put it, erm erm erm more simplistically how, how many people would have the vote. Erm we see this within the context of the reform movement in Britain after eighteen fifteen. Where you've got reformers ranging from those who want the household suffrage er household suffrage. A vote to all householders. Across to those who wanted erm erm a universal male suffrage. Erm one man one vote. Erm European liberalism is based upon, is based upon context as well of secularism. Or to perhaps er put it more to put it, to make it more erm obvious anti-clericalism. This didn't necessarily mean hostility to religion as such. But the notion of secularism, the notion of anti-clericalism meant that within the liberal states erm the er er there would be a separation of church and state. Erm the church would have no role within the state as being say in a erm erm in other words there would be erm the catholic church in in erm in say er a state like France er should not be the established church. There would be a separation of church and state. And by and large the activities of church and state would be separatist. The church would play no role in the affairs of state. Erm Other notions erm of liberalism of course again which are perhaps pretty obvious freedom of speech and implied in that freedom of religion, freedom of expression, that kind of thing. But in essence they're the main er er the main aspects of er of of er what was meant by liberalism in the er in in er the nineteenth century. Erm it perhaps doesn't strike us as being very revolutionary but of course it depends from the context that you're in erm to perhaps some of the absolute rulers of er of er perhaps, this was revolutionary. Erm What about nationalism? Nationalism we perhaps some of the er er some of the erm concepts of nationalism appearing even before the French revolution. You begin to see er in erm in parts of Europe in the er later eighteenth century a growing emphasis upon er er upon language, literature of of certain areas. I'm thinking of Italy here primarily. Erm as it develops under the impact of the French revolution and Napoleonic rule and then later what nationalism came to be seen as it's the basically the idea that erm that people of a common culture history and language should occupy perhaps that's the wrong word. Er should er should have a separate state. Should not be ruled by a foreign power. So a people with a common culture, history, language should live in a separately defined state. And certainly should not live under the rule of a foreign er power. And our classic examples of course there erm of of of this situation in in post eighteen fifteen Europe are Germany, Italy Poland . Now I've I've suggested that erm in the early nineteenth century, liberalism and nationalism are very much bound up. Er all, all nationalists in a sense are liberals, or liberals are nationalists. One aspect of this of course, one reason er er behind this is is the French revolution. Let's not forget that erm under Napoleonic rule you do see the creation of a so-called king of Italy. It's northern Italy. Erm Napoleon happens to be it's king and and it is very much a client of France. We see the creation of of of the confederation of the Rhine. A a kind of erm united Germany. Erm within, in these states as well you,th the the nationalism of them, although it's in the French direction. It's associated as well with the ideology of Napoleonic France. Erm which does imply an attack on the old feudal regimes er er er previously existing. Erm so after eighteen fifteen there is this link between liberalism and nationalism. I don't wanna go much er er further ahead on this for the moment. We do tend to see liberalism and nationalism parting company. Especially after eighteen forty eight. And as ag I will, I'll be returning to this obviously in consideration of Italy and Germany, but it is perhaps worth making this point now. You do see liberalism and nationalism parting company. Erm and you do get this growing awareness that not all of that while all liberals might be nationalists. All right thinking liberals in Europe from Gladstone in England you know. All right thinking liberals support nationalist aspirations. Gladstone a great advocate of Italian unity for instance. Gladstone an advocate of er of of Balkan nationalism. He wanted Turkey out of the Balkan er er out of south eastern Europe. So all good European liberals are nationalists. It starts to become apparent, very very clear that not all nationalists are good liberals. In fact far from it. Erm if the choice is between securing er your er securing your own state. Securing the nationalist goal and ignoring the liberal goal, many nationalists will go for the nationalist goal. If the price of bringing about your united state is the dumping of liberals, then so be it. In that sense nationalism of course er it perhaps becomes a more dynamic and problematic ideology in nineteenth century Europe. So I I've digressed er from er considering what erm erm er what this has got to do with the er erm congress of Vienna but I think it's er hopefully er er a worthwhile erm er digression. Erm let me turn er briefly to the those who have something good to say about the Vienna settlement. It's had it's supporters er one is always reminded that one of it's key supporters, the former American er er secretary of state and and at the moment, globe-trotting world expert er Henry Kissinger. Kissinger erm who began life as a er er as professor of history. His first major work was a defence of the Vienna settlement. Erm and it it it, it has been defended on a number of grounds. It's been argued by it's supporters that it ushered in an era of peace. Erm At it's most extreme interpretation there's an argument that erm, that the Vienna settlement was a factor in maintaining peace in Europe between eighteen fifteen and nineteen fourteen. Because it's extreme supporters suggest that that it wasn't until nineteen fourteen that a war broke out involving all the great European powers. Erm one would argue that's er that's er, that's an extreme erm er view. Erm there are wars in Europe after eighteen fifteen. And some people might argue the Vienna settlement was a factor in bringing about some of these wars. So it's again, unfortunately it's it comes down in one of these erm pays your money takes your choice erm er arguments. But it is worth making the point that for instance if we take a look after eighteen fifteen of, at the wars. There's war between Russia and Turkey in er eighteen er thirty when Russia militarily intervenes in the Turkish revolt. Of course there's the war war between Russia and Turkey as well in the in in in the eighteen seventies. But for the moment I'm just looking perhaps nearer to the Vienna settlement itself. Erm there's war between er you get the Crimean war between Russia on the one hand and Great Britain and France on the other. And it's always worth remembering about the Crimean erm episode that Austria in essence intervenes on the side er er intervenes not so much on the side of Britain and France but against Russia. Austria played a decisive though non-military role in er in in the Vienna, in in, in the er in the Crimean war. Erm and then we have the so- called nationalist er wars. For instance eighteen sixty four between Denmark and Prussia and Austria. Technically Prussia and Austria here representing the German confederation. It's a war concerning the vexed and famous Schleswig-Holstein dispute of course which I'm sure we're all familiar with. The erm eighteen sixty six war between Prussia and Austria. These are, this is the war which essentially brings about German er unity under Prussian erm erm control. Prussia is the victor of course of this war. shock win for Prussia. Shock win for Prussia! What a kind of er foo sport's page headline isn't it, yeah? . If what you're suggesting is there was an expectation that Prussia might not win the war. Yeah. And given the fact don't forget, it's always worth remembering this and I've I've made, I'll be making the point later on. Most of the German states supported Prussia in the Austrian Prussian war. Including the states. Supported Austria sorry. Supported Austria. Not supported Prussia. I think . Now of course there are the wars for Italian erm er unification. Eighteen fifty nine. A war between Au between Austria on the one hand and France and technically Piedmont on the other. Although the Piedmontese army didn't arrive until the battles were over . There was war between on the one hand Austria and the other hand France and Piedmont. Erm and then of course in a sense almost bringing these things together the, the major and perhaps most influential of these er wars. The war between France what is normally referred to as the Franco-Prussian war. I suppose to be technical it ought to be the er it ought to be referred to as the Franco- German war. It ought to be a war between France and a united Germany. But as it is, it is primarily Prussia that's er involved. The war between France and Prussia. Eighteen seventy to seventy one. The argument is, is that okay these are, that certainly erm we see a number of wars in er nineteenth century Europe. But the argument is well they're not very big wars are they? They're they're short er wars. They range I mean er the the er the er Prussian Austro-Prussian war of eighteen sixty six is is referred to as what the six weeks war and and erm the five, five weeks of that or or or whatever were were involved in peace negotiations. The war itself was just three days. Erm there was only one battle in it you know but That erm that the war between France and erm and and and Austria was fought in June erm essentially in June of er of eighteen er fifty nine. They are short wars, the argument is. The same with the Dan Danish Austro. Danish war the wars in Denmark and Austria and Prussia one might imagine a rather short- lived er war. How long did it take ? Well not very long. I suppose it's erm in in that sense erm er I I I I can see what you're, this, I don't think that's a factor in in in the, in the erm in in the fact that these wars are short. I think these wars are short because they're fought for limited objectives. They don't tend to escalate. Because the, because only one or two of the powers are involved in them. Or three perhaps in in in in the Crimea. Erm Nevertheless, to some extent the wars reflect the breakdown of the Vienna settlement. So it's a kind of a strange argument to suggest on the one hand the Vienna settlement was a factor in in preventing wars between all the great , er major war involving all the great powers. Erm when at the same time the Vienna settlement appears to be crumbling like after er erm after eighteen thirty or something. Of course erm it's perhaps, perhaps it's looking slightly to the er historical future it it's er it it was bad news in one sense because erm there came to be a view taken in Europe that wars between the great powers would be short, sharp wars. And hence the feeling in nineteen fourteen when the first world war broke out that it would er all be over by Christmas. Because it, cos people were you know erm as is often said generally of of a of a general staffs of armies. They're always fighting the previous war. There was this view that the first world war would be rather like a re-run of some of these wars at the end of the nineteenth century. Erm which didn't turn out to be the case. Erm so I would say, I'll just wrap this up erm on on erm on on on this point the er by making by introducing the fact that some, some historians have argued that these wars were short. Okay they had limited objectives. They were correcting the Vienna settlement. That's in a way how you can perhaps square the circle. You can argue these wars were corrective. Erm And the other factor that that's introduced as well is that the powers got into the habit of meeting in congresses. And you do see erm in the nineteenth century erm the powers still meeting together. For instance at the end of the Crimean war in eighteen fifty six the peace treaty that's er er that's held is actually a congress. All the powers attended the eighteen fifty six treaty of Paris. It's not just a a peace treaty signed by it's not just, er it's not just a direct signing of a peace treaty between say France Britain, Russia. It turns into a congress. The congress of Berlin eighteen seventy eight. When it appears that there might be a major outbreak in erm in in in in south eastern Europe. The powers do perhaps get into the habit of erm of erm of meeting together. Okay anyway, we'll er leave it at that then for the moment. Chairman appointed to E I P and to the North Yorkshire number three. Can I say that the purpose of the E I P is to examine the various issues that have been id identified for discussion. And the panel's role is to report on those issues. Er we are not required or intending to look at objections which have been submitted on other aspects of the structure plan. We are simply concerned with those issues which we will be discussing over the next erm eight days or so. The er other aspect I think erm for the purpose of those who were not at the er pre meeting, is to introduce the other panel member, and that Miss Roz who is a senior inspector, with the planning inspectorate on my right. On my left is the panel secretary Mrs Clare . And of course you will already be aware of the er program office which is outside just off the corridor. Now can I get some of the mechanics out of the way first of all before we before I ask North Yorkshire to make a start with their presentation? Firstly, I presume that those who want lunch, sandwiches here have already er taken care of their order. I would also like to add that the small meeting room which is off the corridor, opposite the program office, is ava available for you to er relax during the lunch break, and eat your sandwiches in there, rather than bring them into the hall. The other thing I would like to make sure and this applies also to the members of the public as well as those people who are participating in the discussion, could you please make sure that you have registered for the day. Er you can do that during the coffee break if you haven't already done so. now some of you will also have seen a form being circulated, asking you to agree that the recordings that are being made of the discussions, can be used as part of a research project. Certainly I was asked about this er well before the er E I P er and we agreed that there w Well certainly I agreed that I could see nothing wrong with that since it is a cl closed research project, and nothing will be divulged at all er publicly. Apart from which of course, that everything we say is being held in public session in any event. The recordings are available for you if you wish or will be available for you if you wish to er improve your memory on what has been said during the discussion periods. I must add that we will not be producing daily summaries, er I think it's a task which is a fairly daunting on and quite frankly, er they will not be produced in the sense At the end That they would not be available at the end of each day. Erm as I say, the recordings will be available if you wish to refresh your memory. They will be held during the course of the E I P here, otherwise they will be help by the county council. Now I was about to make a comment that er well most of you know who who you are and where you're sitting, er those that have already done that have turned their name tags round so we can see. Er one or two others, I would welcome that. We can identify you more readily that way. In terms of progressing or taking part in the discussion, can I suggest that if you want to come in on a particular item, you put your name board up like that, so that we can readily observe it er and equally, our friend who is looking after the microphones can make sure that the vol the volume of your microphone is turned up at the appropriate time. I don't think you wish us to tamper with the microphones at all do you? No, fine. Now if I can move on to today's session, we are going to concer concerned ourself obviously with housing land applications and primarily with matter one A. But before before I ask North Yorkshire to introduce the matter, can I put H B F on notice that I would like them to follow on from North Yorkshire, when they have made their contribution. I would also like to say that er whilst we are going to talk about the housing allocations in the sort of strategic sense, across the county first of all, there are as you will remember er the matters of some disagreements, differences of opinion on demographic issues. I raised this at the pre-meeting and asked that the various participants should have a look at those issues where they had areas of disagreement to see whether or not er they could reconcile those. And I I would like that to be touched on as well. Er by North Yorkshire. I think s the differences in some cases ar are so large that it's inescapable er that we have a discussion on. The other thing, and this is a case of where the panel bites back as it were. We have laid on the table, two tables, P S O one and P S O two. Erm and what we have done in compiling these tables and this has been done by the panel secretary, is to take from the various submissions of the participants, the various housing figures, the the various projections of likely need, of the housing requirement and the effective summary really is in P S O one, but when you look at P S O two er there's a little more detailed work gone into that. Now could I ask, if there are any erm matters on there where you have found and error and it's an error of fact, can I just stress that at this stage? Erm could you let the panel secretary know er about that this mo sometime this morning, but certainly er in time for our start of the afternoon session. But we felt the tables themselves, could provide a useful background er and in having had them compiled, they point up some rather interesting issues, which we would return to eventually. Now if I can pass on and ask Mr from North Yorkshire, who first of all is going to give you an introduction which in effect which effectively will set the context of alteration number three. And then I presume Mr you'll go on to deal with matter A one A. Yes that's correct Mr , er it will be brief. Well ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of this examination in public, it would probably be helpful to all present and participating, if the county council explained why this alteration is necessary, and the relationship of its content to regional and national guidance. Well now in case anyone present is uncertain, erm of the geography of the county, there is a plan displayed er on the board er at the back of the room which w should help er in that circumstance. The county is the largest by area in England, it borders two conurbations to the North and South, it's unique environmentally, both in its natural and built form. having two national parks, two and half areas of outstanding natural beauty, a heritage coast and a wealth of historic towns er and villages. The county council believes that North Yorkshire, the character of it, er is a national asset, but there is a view that because the county is large and relatively sparsely populated, there should be almost what appears to be an open door policy for development. We for our part are unaware of any statement of national policy that requires sparsely populated counties to be earmarked for development. Well now, the starting position today is that the North Yorkshire County Structure Plan was approved by the Secretary of State in November nineteen eighty. Together with subsequent alterations in January nineteen eighty seven and August nineteen eighty nine. I think it's fair to say that the Secretary of State has accepted that the special character of North Yorkshire, require a balance to be struck between environmental protection and development in the county. And we consider that this approach enjoys widespread support in North Yorkshire. Now district councils and National Park committees have approach in pursuit of their own plan making activities and although statutory local planning coverage in the county is still incomplete, the planning process at both county and district level, generally aims to meet the Secretary of State's wishes for North Yorkshire. As during the examination in public into the first alteration, this E I P will demonstrate again the wide measure of agreement between county and district councils. And we for our part think that this counts for a lot. As to the reasons why this alteration is necessary, the county council thinks there are three reasons, The first is to reflect the wish of government that the development planning system er is up to date, second and more practically, to provide a context for district wide development plan, and third, the urgent need to resolve the future strategic planning direction of greater York. As far as up to date development plans is concerned, this is supported by all sections of the community and need not be dwelt upon. An appropriate conte for context for district wide plans is necessary because the approved structure plan only extends to nineteen ninety six. Quite clearly the time horizon needs to be extended to allow structure plan numeric policies to provide clear guidance, not least in respect of a supply of land for housing in the county. District councils are presently making good progress on the development plans and appro and an approved alteration is clearly essential for that process. Well now the third factor, Greater York, has probably been the single most important planning issue for the county council and the Greater York districts over the past ten years. The ingredients I think we well know. A greenbelt agreed in principle by the Secretary of State but yet to be defined statutorily, a general absence of consensus on where future development in Greater York should be located, and increasing intervention by the Secretary of State on planning applications in Greater York. The county council and the five Greater York district councils began to address the issue in nineteen eighty eight and have spent five years in moving toward this examination in public. That might seem like a long time, but the issues have clearly been complex, and have been progressed as quickly as possible not least through vigourous prodding by the D O E, keen to see approval of a long term development strategy for Greater York and more importantly, a statutory definition of the York gre greenbelt. Well we think that the D O E would probably be quite pleased with the position that we reached today. During the period since nineteen eighty eight, the Greater York authorities have agreed a long term development strategy involving a new settlement contribution. This enabled progress on a York greenbelt local plan which in April nineteen ninety three completed a seven month public enquiry. The county council further accepted that an alteration to the approved structure plan was necessary to legitimize the strategy as the approved structure plan made no provision for it. That has also been progressed as concurrently as possible with the greenbelt local plan. So here we are today, almost at the end of a very long process, having experienced a wide ranging debate about the future of Greater York and numerous consultation exercises. The E I P today is probably one of the last pieces in the jigsaw. The completion of which will at long last resolve strategic planning issues in Greater York. Well of course this process pr could just as easily have been progressed through a full scale review of the structure plan rather than an alteration. As far as a full scale review of the structure plan is concerned, there is no doubt in the county council's mind, that such a full scale review would have significantly extended the process when all the players wish to see rapid progress, particularly to deal with the problems of Greater York. In nineteen ninety, the county council did consider the merits of a full scale review as against an alteration. It accepted that while there were arguments for a full scale review, the priority had to progress on an alteration which as quickly as possible, established the principle of a Greater York new settlement and progress on the greenbelt local plan. This approach was supported by the regional office of the Department of the environment. It is an alteration therefore that is t to be debated at this E I P and its coverage is relatively straightforward, though its content controversial. Policy H one provides the numeric provision for dwellings in the county after two thousand and six. Policy H two is a new policy which makes provision for a new settlement to help meet the development needs of the Greater York area. Policies I five and I twelve provide for land for employment in the period up to two thousand and six, while in the T policies, the opportunity is taken to update road schemes in the county. Finally, with the support of our district council, the dis the county council seeks to correct a serious omission of strategic planning policies for North Yorkshire, the inclusion of policy E two of a policy to control development in the countryside. All the policies have been the subject of consultation, but in the case of policy H two, we've experienced almost five years of continued discussion and debate first of all through the Greater York study and then through this alteration. The county council believes that policy H two is essential for the future of the Greater York area. The policy even has the distinction of attracting from the regional office of the Department of the Environment, in the paper to be considered at this E I P, a phrase of mild support. All these efforts do need of course to be assessed against their compliance or otherwise with national and regional guidance. The former in large part embodied in P P G, the latter in regional planning guidance for York and Humberside, yet to be issued by the Secretary of State. As far as the former is concerned, planning policy guidance, we will have different views. Certainly this alteration will ensure the strategic policy in North Yorkshire is up to date. And the alteration will address issues clearly appropria appropriate to structure plans. The the policies will be much debated, with quotes from various P P Gs, probably selective, being used by both the county council and objectors to justify their position. In any event, P P Gs are carefully drafted to ensure that few options are closed off. The county council does feel comfortable about the compliance of its alteration with national planning guidance. As far as regional planning guidance is concerned, there is none. It's quite clear, the needs of sensible planning require progress on development plans. nowhere has this been more evident than in Greater York. While P P G twelve provides for a cascade of planning policy, I suggest that only a purist would delay a resolution of the needs of Greater York, through the development plan process, in order to await regional planning guidance. In any event, the draft regional advice which has recently been the subject of consultation, does not conflict with this alteration, though Leeds and Bradford have reservations on the level of housing provision in North Yorkshire. We think the Secretary of State's present wish for ordered planning will benefit from the discussions at this E I P. There are I suspect, few organizations represented around this table, public or private, that would wish a delay in decision. Finally panel, the county council considers that the issues raised in this alteration require early decision and not in two or three years time. It is the county council's responsibility to bring forward proposals to enable progress to be made. The county council has taken those decisions and we think they ought to be debated vigorously and following that discussion, the panel will come to its conclusion. The county council therefore commends this alteration to the panel. That's all I would like to say . You don't wish to pursue in slightly more detail in terms of your introduction,th the issue one A which is the is the housing provision reasonable ? Ye Yes indeed I do. I was taking a step at a time and Yeah well I'm quite happy. Okay. Can I can I just say before you start Mhm. Er I should have reminded everybody at the beginning, when you wish when you start to speak, would you please introduce yourself, give your name and who you represent. So we can make absolutely certain on the recording. That's each time. Sorry Mr . Before we start chairman, I wonder whether we can make sure that Peter , North Yorkshire County Council, that all round the table have got the relevant North Yorkshire paperwork. And I think the documents that we have put in are N Y one,posi various positions er statements, Paper N Y two, described as population household economic activity rate projections, assumptions and methodology. N Y three is a county council commentary on the regional census study, funded by the local authorities and the D O E. N Y four is a paper entitled Housing Growth Provision. And then we miss a number erm er and move to N Y eleven which is a paper which we have put in which attempts to look at the differences between certainly between the N Y C C projections and the H B F projections. And that in fact is headed by erm a summary table erm which attempts to set down on p one piece of paper, where the differences erm erm lie. And I wonder erm we specifically er identified erm the wish to to to address that particular issue. Erm and what I would like to do, that paper was written by Mr , erm our research officer and perhaps after I've made one or two general remarks, he could give you the flavour erm of of of the difference as we as we see, if that would be acceptable to you? That that that's quite acceptable. So first So if I Peter , North Yorkshire. If I continue then with some introductory remarks erm on policy H one a and one A, perhaps that would set the scene er for the discussion, then Mr will very briefly erm look at the differences as he sees them between the two sets erm of projections. Well policy H one addresses the number of dwellings to be provided in the county and the districts and and in in Greater York. And quite clearly there's a disagreement on the number of dwellings that the county council proposes. The this happened before, it happened in nineteen eighty seven erm on the first alteration when review er when they were a w wide range er of suggestions er made as to the appropriate level of provision. And to an extent, we ran through this same debate erm at the greenbelt local plan enquiry for two days during September er nineteen ninety two. It seems to be a relatively simple debate, there is either too much development in the views of some participants, erm or there is er too little. Others suggest that the county council er is about right. The county council would appear to be somewhere in the middle, based on the range of views that have been submitted to this E I P. At the top of the range we have the House Builders Federation with and excess of fif fifty thousand dwellings. At the bottom, we have J C with a figure in excess of thirty one thousand dwellings. The county council appear to be somewhere in the middle, er at around forty one thousand er two hundred dwellings. I think I need to say on that, that that should not be taken as the county council sitting on the fence between two opposing er extremes. The county council thinks that its proposed provision is the right approach and it's a balanced approach in line erm with Secretary of State's previously e stated wishes. The approach of the county council is based on certain principles, first of all it reflects the decision of the Secretary of State on the originally approved structure plan and particularly on the first alteration to the structure plans er in nineteen er eighty seven. And we've summarized in N Y four, paragraph twenty one to twenty seven, the main issues erm as we see them er there. And the conclusions appear to be that migration into the county needs to be modified, and secondly, that government policy was then and still is to pursue policies leading to the regeneration of urban areas e around North Yorkshire particularly West Yorkshire er and Cleveland. In Cleveland to the North, we have a deprived area er by any standard which is making valiant efforts to make provisions to retain er its own population as part of regenerating county Cleveland. In West Yorkshire to the South we have similar problems of inner city decline and there as we understand it the authorities wish to cater for their housing needs. The county council accepts the problems and is keen to do all it can to support those authorities er to North and South. But the county council does accept that trends for migration into the county are there and the county council cannot turn off the top to turn off the tap to reclu to preclude any further migration into the county. As a result, the county council accepts the need for a substantial element of development, which is the response to inward migration in the county. And around about sixty percent of the overall provision as we calculate it is to accommodate migration led development in North Yorkshire. As far as the debate with Leeds and Bradford is concerned, there are three districts adjacent to West Yorkshire, Selby, Harrogate and Craven. And the difference between us and the West Yorkshire authorities, appears to be eighteen hundred dwellings. That doesn't appear to be much erm in terms of quantity in our estimation in terms of the level of provision that Leeds and Bradford er are providing, but it would create a major problem er in North Yorkshire. At the other extreme, there are arguments for reduction in the at the other end of the spectrum there are arguments for reduction in the level er of housing provision proposed er in North Yorkshire. The county council does not accept that there should be any further reduction in the amount of housing that is proposed to be =commodat accommodated in the county. The county council quite clearly accepts its regional responsibilities to accommodate a significant degree er of migration led er development. We believe to further reduce erm erm the level of migration led development in North Yorkshire er would not be in the best interest of the region as a whole and more importantly, would not be in accord with the general provisions o of the structure plan to accommodate a a significant level er of development. As we see it therefore, the county council is not turning the tap off in respect of migration led development, and it is not being e too generous. We believe that the balanced approach e of the county council e is right, it reflects the views of the Secretary of State er in nineteen eighty seven, and we think it's the appropriate way for North Yorkshire to develop, bearing in mind the clear environmental constraints er within North Yorkshire. Well chairman that gives a flavour of the documentation the various documentation that we put in. You did ask erm for us to try and help this examination by giving some indication of the differences between shall we say, the two sides of the debate. Er we put in N Y eleven which is our attempt er to identify first in a summary page, er and then in a more voluminous paper, with appendices, where the differences lie and the reasons that er that we pursue one course as opposed to another. Erm this has been prepared by Mr erm and perhaps it would be helpful if he gave you the flavour of it. Stuart , North Yorkshire. Well sir er we have as Mr has said, in N Y eleven, the commentary er of our o opinions on the situation put forward by the House Builders Federation. Whereas our own er reasoned commentary is in N Y two. Er N Y two paragraph nine er gives us the background to our approach in population projections. We have er framed them to take account of the most recent information available, subject to limitations that staff time limits causes. We have sir Excuse me Mr . Can you all hear? It it shouldn't be necessary either to adjust the microphones, to switch them on or to move them actually. Alright carry on. Wherever possible sir, we have tested the validity of the individual assumptions against alternative sources of data. Er we have looked to supplement national e information by our local knowledge specifically I might instance one er where we have made a survey of the institutions which is one source of er possible difference between er people looking at the situation locally and those from further afield. We have erred I think in several instances to try and give a margin of flexibility er I think if we'd really tried hard to follow a policy of restraint within the assumptions of this model, we could have produced even lower figures than we have. I think we've tried to err being being reasonable. So that was the general approach. Er the particular methodology we've used is a population projection model, produced by the Institute. The Housing and Population model. Er this is quite commonly accepted as er in use in many places and I think my our colleagues on the other side of the table have been using the same basic modelling methodology. It starts by taking the present population a as the population of the base year, and proceeds to age the population, er adding births and subtracting deaths to get a population in the projection years. Er it begins by subtracting the institutional population from the total population in order to get the private household population. Once the population levels are calculated in the model, the population is converted in to households using marital status and rates. And once the households are calculated, the final process is to convert the households into dwellings. And to summarize the methodology that we've used, we've set out our in the single sheet in the front of N Y eleven, various assumption areas that constitute the use of the model and our choice of the appropriate assumption for each of these areas. So that for instance, er starting with a base population, we've used the Registrar General's nineteen ninety one provisional estimates. Er this was because er at the time the est that the calculations were made and reported to the committee, these were the most recently available. Er other have been able to use more recently er released information,n er namely the Registrar General's nineteen ninety one final revised estimates. As you will see from the sheet,small difference in the total population. Had the county council been able to use the final figures, the dwelling requirements at the end of the projection period would have been somewhat lower than the figure that we have produced. The conversion of the rate of population to private household population has been accepted that er we use as everybody has used, the county council's estimate of the institutional population. So this does not appear as a technical difference. Sorry would you re would you repeat that. You say there is no difference of opinion on that one now. On on the level of the institutional Yeah. population. There is a difference of opinion in the effect on the number of households produced by the way that the military Yeah. population in married quarters is treated. Yes I appreciate that. Yes. But you haven't highlighted that I haven't highlighted that as an area of difference . N n no no. Cou co could I ask you and try to short circuit actually the presentation if you if you if you don't mind, to actually concentrate on those issue items where there are these significant differences which which you which you mentioned. Well the largest difference er from the sheet is in the death statistics. And er we will maintain that we've used the appropriate statistics from the office of population censuses and surveys and the Registrar General's er and erm our colleagues have made an error is our opinion on er the er death statistics that they've used in their calculations of the model in our opinion. In that they have not taken the correct figures. I can't explain the reasons why . Our our figures we maintain are the correct ones. Yeah I mean I I would assume that there must be agreed death rates which everybody would accept as as as being applicable in projecting population . We would have said we would have thought that too sir but er it appears that er Well I I think I'll wait for H B F to come back on that one. But yo the figure the the figure which you mentioned Yeah . Can can I just add sir o one point I I in my in my preamble I said that we were sometimes able from a local point of view to take into account information locally that perhaps you wouldn't have got from further afield. Er within the model, there is the provision to er not take the date which is issued with the model, but to allow for local correction factors and it er maybe that we've got the locally correct death statistics in and our colleagues haven't got the local corrections. Well we'll we'll we'll come back to that one later one but if you just carry on talking through the various er items where there is these there are these significant differences. Well that is the er most significant difference sir. Er a difference has er appeared in concealed households, at three thousand . The county council maintains that er the project methodology takes account of all classes of households er within the methodology itself. And so there does not need to be a separate provision made for numbers of concealed households. Er our understanding is that er our colleagues the other side of the table wish to reduce the number of consumer households from the level it was at the nineteen ninety one census, which is the figure here, three one seven to zero. Eliminating the numbers of concealed households, and therefore the number of dwellings to be provided to cater for that. Er and we feel that that would be er unrealistic but within the modelling context, we don't think that it needs to be separately taken into account. There are households concealed households at the beginning of the period in our projections, there are households at the end of the period which are also concealed. This we feel matches the real world situation, where er the poor being always with us, there will always be people who while wishing to have accommodation . So that is an area of er significant difference. The next er most important er in terms of of erm numbers is er migration levels. H here we we have two categories of of areas of difference. There is the technical basis on the one hand, and there is a policy er er area. I think then there's a catchphrase, environmental discounts. And I think these phrases appear in the text. As far as the technical points are concerned er there is the question, which source of data should be used to quantify migration. And over how long a period should the migration be taken. The county council has used the National Health Service's central record of patient re-registrations as its principle source of for migration data and has chosen an eight year period to measure the trend. Er our colleagues I think have chosen a different period trend. I think it's a ten year period they've taken and th the er source is as much the a sort of a residual figure that comes from the Registrar General's mid year estimates,nineteen ninety one. As against the nineteen eighty one estimates. Deducting actual change and ending up with . We maintain that this balance not only includes migration but includes other adjustments. So the figures for migration are not necessarily purely migration figures and we are er we don't dispute the length of the trend to take the ten years. Ten years as it happens is not a lot different to eight years. The choice of the time period for migration is very important. if we had taken the most recent trend, it would have been over the last three years. This is shown er in the appendix to N Y two. Appendix five. Which is a table showing annual average migration figures for the years nineteen eighty five to nineteen ninety two. Appendix five of N Y two. There you'll see there is an eight year trend, the mean of which is just under five thousand. From which we make a deduction and I'll come back to that deduction in a moment if I may sir. If one took just the last three years, the annual average migration figure would be a little under three thousand three hundred. Had we used this three thousand three hundred figure as the annual migration, then the housing requirement figures come out of the projection rather then two thousand and six, would have been some ten thousand fewer. So the choice of the length of the trend is er very important. The source is important and er how you deal with the source. Er I mentioned that we have made an allowance for students in this migration. Er this is not to say, I must emphasize that we have discounted students in this migration assessment. What we have done is to discount excess students. Er there is a technical report that has examined this sort of information erm for the year nineteen eighty one nineteen eighty eighty one, specifically for this county. Er the research found that there were three hundred or so students who registered with the health service but didn't re-register or didn't leave. So that that was a a a fact that er Yeah. Does this make a significant difference to the the hous household requirement ? Yes One o one of the elements that goes towards the four thousand four hundred Yeah. difference in migration. Er I don't think I couldn't at this moment in time, give you the components No. of of which of these four thousand four hundred is d due to the time period which is due to the source which is due to the er student er excess student discount. So that is a significant er difference sir between e our calibrations of the model and others. Yeah. other differences are smaller in scale as you will see, there is a difference in er vacant dwellings,the county council Because it keeps happening, boys and girls in their summer holiday keep get getting taken away by people they don't know and nasty things done to them. So all we want you to do is remember the video remember Pippin yeah? And play safely till you come back to school next term. Play safe and never go with strangers. Strangers. Like James did. never. Like that James did, yes that little boy of three, James did didn't he? Two. Two or three whatever, I've just been Two corrected. Alright. Two. Who's James? Thank you Miss. Thank you. Will you do one thing before you go though class? Will you promise me when you go home tonight you be the teachers and your mum and dad be the children and you tell them all about Stranger Danger and you tell them you're never gonna go with strangers and see what your mum and dad says to you. Yeah, will you do that for me? Yeah. Well done. They don't live with me. Oh I always tell him that. Good man. Thank you very much indeed, thanks for your time. See you later class. Okay,le let's get started! We're, we're going to conclude now the discussion of the various ways in which, bacteria, in particular er lead to the production of infective disease and really to centre round, centres round the discussion of the pathogenesis, that is the mechanism by which the disease is produced and lunanspach. And I hope to run through today, basically, a set of examples of specific infective positions which show particular virulence factors er manifest themselves in terms of clinical disease. We start with er er a fine and exciting topic for Monday morning the topic of boils and in their finalist form they're shown here as starike. But, the sa the very same organisms responsible for that relatively moderate appearance can also produce blocked er region of Prince Charles, the carbuncle with which in it's most er florid form can break down and produce the series, but really effectively interconnecting . If we sample one of these cavities in which the process is er which produce boils er are going on, almost inevitably we find this organism staphylococcusorius and offspotulates have been clearly fulfilled with organism and this disease most notably by a bunch of of medical students who are subjected to all sorts of tortures by their professor of microbiology back in the nineteen fifties. And over the years it's been possible to identify a number of factors produced by these bacteria that seem to make sense in terms of the pathology and the conditions. Now the pathology is by a chief information and i in fact, the chief information could be provoked merely by the presence of organisms. You will, you will recognise from your immunology that the presence is certainly foreign antigenic materials can lead immediately to, to the acute alternatives. But, notable inside er the material that characterises the boils and abscesses, there is a cell death, both of bacteria and of the both the defending cells and the structural cells. And, to a very large extent tri cell death can be related to the ability of staph orius to produce elicit toxins, toxins which actually leave the cell death and . But the characteristic of this puss forming organism is that the legions it produces are wooled off, that is they're relatively localized. And although the er, the causal relationship is not completely established, it is a very helpful way of remembering that one of the principle distinguishing features of this organism which separates it from other members of the genus staphylococcus it pr it produces this enzyme to coagulate things on and the effects of this enzyme are illustrated here as against the control preparation, you see a clot form due to the action of this enzyme on clotting practice which has been put into this test tube serum. So this is almost certain a virulence factor but is also very useful in differentiating pathogenic species of staphylococci from non-pathogenic species. And, as as you'll be hearing in later er stages of the course there are many non-pathogenic species of staphylococci. It's worth also mentioning, since you saw it in the practical class, that staphylococci in general produce this enzyme catalase all of these er lo thi this is the enzyme which breaks down hydrogen peroxide and detoxifies it. All of these factors together lead us an to recognise as it a puss forming organism which is often recognised by the term hyogenic organism, ability to produce puss in er the form of reactions it initiates. Now I want at least, to intro introduce the possibility in the series of diagrams I'm going to show you in this lecture that we can relate it to the four stages of pathogenesis that we, we outline briefly er, in the last lecture. The first stage being the establishment, the next stage being penetration, the third stage being damage, what actually produces the damage in the disease, and the fourth stage is, if the disease is going to last for any period of time the ability of the organism to persist. I'm going to introduce this abbreviated momentictiture here in the hope that during the course of the lecture I'll be able to add comments about which of these factors lead to which of these results. Er, but if we run out of time and I find we haven't we we we can't fit it all in I'd like you all to attempt to do this for yourselves after er, the lecture is over. Okay? So, establishment for staphylococcusorius is often not an important feature because in the majority of infections we're talking about an endogenous infection, the organism was there in the first place. Penetration in many instances is not related to a property of the organism itself, in most instances it's re related to some form of injury in which the organism is moved from it's normal skin location to a deep tissue location. So we won't mention these factors here, although in in some instances er, these properties are important to talk about for staph orius. The damage, is fairly obvious to see is produced by these two and it's worth pointing out that persistence can be related to this catalase enzyme. Staphylococci have some degree of resistance to killing by phagocytes and yo you should recall that phagocytes er, one of the mechanisms by which phagocytes kill intercellular organisms is the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and catalase is one of the ways that these can detoxified and th there's fairly good evidence that the catalase enzyme enables er,staph orius to persist. Okay. So, that's, that's the first example of a very common condition. Let's move on now to consider a very important type of infection such as meningitis. You recognise by particularly common in children not recognised by the particular posture that they adopt and extended neck, rigid neck due to the inflammation of le , lymphees which I will resist being a reflection of the neck, completely rigidly. It's a disease which, if it a , they're fortunate enough to re , recover from the disease, if it's been severe enough the inflammation may have involved er, some of the cranial nerves, and here we can see a third nerve palsy er as a result of er, the process. If you take a sample er, of ce the cera cereblis fluid during the course of acute bacteria meningitis you will find it's drowning, drowning, not due the fact that it's an organism, but present, being due to the presence of puss cells. This is another biogenical fluid and, in about a third of the cases you will find this, very faintly with them Mm mm. which you can just about see here a in conjunction with the puss cells with which it is busily the life and death, life and death tackle. This organism is the fastidious grand negative rod you saw in the erm practical class innocuous influenzi. And it is a a very important pathogen responsible for about a third of the cases of meningitis in in this country almost exclusively in children. Now, the process we recognise in the pa pathogenesis of meningitis due to this organism is as follows, first of all and then it is able, by, mechanisms not completely described but we could probably involve this transpschycosis er phenomenon that er, I I briefly mentioned last time. First of all, penetrates from the into the bloodstream and then into the cerebral spinal fluid. Now the basis for the pathogenesis is not well enough established for us to expect you to understand the details of how it achieves these processes, but one thing which is remarkably clear is that the organism is a capsule producing organism and that once it gets into the er cerebral spinal fluid that predominately is an acute inflammatory . We do recognise establishment factors, that is adhesions in this part of the process and it is very clear that the capsule is one of the factors which allows the organism to pe , persist because it helps the organism to resist phagocytosis. You'll notice that the damage in this instance is actually the result of the acute inflammatory response, not particularly some form of direct noxious effect of the organism, so the contribution of the host is absolutely critical. Now, the reason we we focus on the capsule as illustrated on the right here is that hymophylus have many different capsular types, but but only one type appears to be associated with meningitis. This type B capsule refers to a particular pulse and has it's so important in the pathogenesis of the capsule that antibodies to it can be used er,ca , er can actually completely prevent the disease and we end up with a capsule vaccine based on the type B pulse . Plus, referencing with the other two organisms which produce meningitis in, in humans it is very prominent that both of these, licea meninigitipitus and staphylococcus are also very prominent capsule mechanisms. Hello! That's like the type. H I for hymopholus influenzi. And that's, that H I is actually the th th H, H I B is the acronym for the vaccine. There's a new vaccine introduced last October which is being er, used for the first time in this country to prevent meningitis in children. Is that just the name of the vaccine? H, well H I B is a, an abbreviation for the strain of hymopholus that produces the infection, but the name of the vaccine the H I B vaccine, yeah. Okay? I should say that a, a lot of this information will be covered again during this course, what I'm trying to do now is to bring together the the themes in a pathogenesis of infection that I introduced last week into the practical context of clinical infections. And to to, to try and illustrate to you why we focus on particular virulence factors for particular organisms. Move on now to to look at an area that's er not frequently er doesn't impinge a great deal on life in this country but it certainly does for travellers and for many people in the developing world. This is the topic of secretory diarrhoea produced by infective agents. This is a dramatic disorder of the small intestine which produces a massive outflow of water electrolytes that can be fatal within a matter of hours after the onset of disease! We recognise two agents which are er, responsible in bacterial causes of this process,th there are many others but these are certainly the most important. choleri, the cholera vacilus and er, an acronym here, ETEC, I wouldn't worry about taking down the full er, er , it actually stands for e entrotoxigenic ecolytes, it's a strain or a group of ecolars that are able to produce this effect. These diseases are common in areas er where an out pouring of water from the individual is squared up with a ou , out pouring of people into the water, then you can appreciate that that transmission is very er, readily promoted under those circumstances. The effects on the, the individual are very dramatic! Dehydration, er can produce death within a matter of fe , er a few hours and and an understanding of the mechanism by which this dehydration leads us into one of the most effective forms of heat treatment er, ever produced. A prominent feature of secretory diarrhoea is that effective and normal bowel in,yo you ca , you can ignore this sign are almost indistinguishable, so despite this dramatic change in the physiology of the small bowel, borthalogically it actually looks quite normal. And you have a normal meconium. Now, the organisms that produce this effect haven't, have this target which is around zero for the choleri , the villi of a small intestine and the both of these organisms have pro prominent adhesion mechanisms. Let's just show you something with that. In an affected small bowel you will see the grey background with these tiny little curved rods present the whole area of the er, the villi is covered by the organisms which are er stuck down effectively by the processes which you ca , you can't really see them in the transmission micrograph, but they are attached to specific receptors on the surface of the entrocite membrane. Once they've got there, the organism really goes no further. Both the cholera organism and the ETEC organism secrete toxins referred to here as C T for cholera toxin and LT for the le Lethane toxin. It is very striking that these toxins are actually almost exactly the same molecule! So that although these are er fairly different relatives in terms of bacteria it's striking that the ETEC organism has been able to acquire in some way almost exactly the same gene that's present in choleri. And, this toxin when released from these tightly organisms disorders the er the physiological activity of the lining cells, the empha cells. The molecular oh we've lost a slide! The molecular basis for this is very well understood and forms one of the important themes in er the effects of e , exotoxin in human cells. This toxin is composed of two components er, of binding components and active component. Binding component binds to specific receptors on the emphacyte and the active component penetrates into the cell and inactivates the controlling mechanism on the production of . And this is the cell that er, is possessed by several other toxins that affect, not just the gut but other parts of the body as well. I should point out that in one of the features of adhesions is that it takes two to tango, so to speak! Where specific adhesions are involved the the , the structures that are, are most commonly associated with a , require a specific receptor for the adhesion reaction to take place and that if the potential host doesn't have specific receptor they're not susceptible to that particular strain of organisms. Okay. Let's move on to look at another fairly dramatic infection which is a case of diphtheria. That, which is er a infection ca characterized by this profuse athema of th the base of the neck, referred to as bull neck if you look inside this child's er pharynx you see this very messy inflammatory process at the back and the whole of the respiratory mucosa is beginning to detach in what's referred to as a pseudo-membrane. In, fatal cases this pseudo- membrane can extend right from the top of the respiratory track here down into bronchi, and you can get these enormous casts of mucrotic material er, starting in the pharynx and working their way right down in the bronchi. It's been known for a very long time that from these cases you can isolate this organism C diphtheria bacterium which you saw in the practical classes and has this distinctive stayed property where er certain granules can be stayed up and also the arrangement of the cells is rather reminiscent of what called Chinese lettering. The picture, the acute picture which you've just seen is virtually exclusively due to the production of a toxin and that toxin produces really a necrotic pharyngitis inflammation of the pharynx associated with necrosis and detachment of what we call the pseudo-membrane. In very severe cases the toxin gets into the blood stream and their paralytic effects toxin i i is to some extent a neuro-toxin, and also there are effects of the heart. So although for the majority of cases that a fatal as a result of diphtheria the fact that , due actually to the pharyngitis and the pseudo- membrane obstructing the respiratory passage. In later stages, the minority of cases may go on to produce these results. Well this is a disease due to another exotoxin which, in practical terms is of importance to you because it's the basis for a test for identifying the . The toxin may or may not be present in strains of er C diphtheria and this is just an immunological test so I wo won't explain it in detail but what you can see is a a strip of er, filter paper which has been bathed in anti-toxin and growth of various different strains of the organism erm which, some of which do produce the toxin you can see lines of precipitation here and some of which don't produce the toxin. And that test has to be applied to es each eyslate because this toxin is not part of the genome of Cherani bacteria diphtheria, it's actually a farged mediated toxin, it's actually encoded for by a bacteria farged. So when What's paresis then? Paresis, paralysis. Oh! I thought you were doing neuro-sciences course? The as I said this, this is required for identification for the organism, but the to the toxin has been recognised for a very, very long time and right from er, the early days the possibility of inactivating the biological properties of a toxin while retaining their immunological properties has been attractive to people seeking to prevent these diseases. And, if you treat this toxin with something like formaldehyde or ethanol, you end up by inactivating it's toxic properties and you end up with what, what we call a toxoid, something that retains immunological properties, it's able to stimulate specific immunity to the toxin but it doesn't have any of the toxic effects and we end up with this toxoid vaccine against diphtheria. And all of you, I would expect, have received the toxoid vaccine against diphtheria. Curiously it has led effectively to the irradification of Cherani bacterium diphtheria from the circulating respiratory flora in this country and the reasons for that are are quite obscure! Another im prominent toxoid vaccine which you should all have received and be regularly receiving boosters for is the tetanus vaccine, and really, a very similar situation pertains here, that the toxin is so important in the pathogenesis of disease, tetanus, that simply immunity to that one factor can lead to immunity er to the disease as a whole. So, I've gone through a series of examples of exotoxins I want to just er, as far as is possible summarize the general properties of exotoxins. First thing to be said about them is that they're all proteins covering a very wide range of molecular weights between three and three hundred kilobocals three thousand to three hundred thousand bocals. And they have very specific impacts because they all result their effective result on an interaction with a specific receptor and er an activity I would express on that receptor or as a result of the er erm the uptake of the toxins. Consequently,. As I've indicated before you can divide them into patha and physiological effects and membrane damage more specifically than what I said before membrane damage is the i i is a particularly important thing. Your patha and physiological toxins are often sub-unital structure and they make the most, the momegictiture most widely used is an A plus B sub-unit structure. The B is a receptor and A is often, although by no means always, an enzyme and in the case the cholera toxin rotusis toxin and several other erm pseudo-membrane toxins and several others, diphtheria toxin they have the specific A viral I think they put the group onto a target molecule and disorder itself . The membrane doesn't use toxins like the lytic toxins that staphylococcusorius expressed er they're often detected by their immunelytic properties, see the in the er, in the bacterial passage. I'm sure you've experienced in many instances here, the effect of lytic toxins in er a boil or some some other unpleasant minor lesion! Gonna go on now to talk about a severe condition which may start out that with a minor skin rash like this, this is called a petechial skin rash they later progress to rather more generalised rash and in it's most severe form it's mucrotic effects on the skin and er, obviously a lethal outcome! This type of picture is almost exclusively related to the isolation of grand negative organisms from the blood, these may be phacili or cocci, doesn't really make any er, any difference. It's the grand nega negative cell wall structure that seems to matter. And we now know that these ghastly effects are the results of what we referred to in the last lecture endotoxins. You will hear in considerable detail in a later lecture about how septic shock and endotoxin work. At this stage it's worth remarking that wa there are perhaps three prominent features of endotoxin effects first of all, they promote physcocine release and th the the two pro , prominent phsycocines affected are I O one, Interlooping one and TMF, tumourmacrosis factor which I hope you heard about in the immunology course. I O one is the molecule most closely associated with the mi , the effects of lodose endotoxin and that is fever I O one er, when released into the blood sys bloodstream affects the hypothalamus and th i one of the principle reasons why infective conditions lead to fever. In more severe situations there's uncontrolled continent acto activation and uncontrolled clotting factor, activation and it's really that last feature that's particularly responsible for the er er ghastly skin disease you saw i in the last sla , in the previous slide! Now the eff the endotoxin as I've is almost exclusively associated with the grand negative cell wall. And again in abbreviated form that, I just want to take you through the molecular basis for endotoxin action. Here is the positive wall with it's large er expansive petroglycan grand negative with an inner and an outer membrane, and the petroglycan sandwiched in between. Here we have a diagram of a grand negative organism with it's inner membrane and outer membrane illustrated here. Very easy to reproduce endotoxic shock in in experimental animals and er, it was found fairly early on that the effects, er the endotoxic effects were almost exclusively associated with the outer membrane. And detailed chemical strains of the outer membrane show that it has a slightly different structure from normal unit membranes. Expand that up, you'll end up with a normal inner leaflet to the membrane, a phospholipids but the outer the , er the outer layer is almost exclusively composed of this stuff, lycropolysacrulite I mentioned this in an earlier lecture but we need to go into in a little bit more detail . This lycropolysacrulite is can then be broken up into three different sections the internal membrane section is referred as lipid A. Lipids in general are not very antigenic erm er it's interesting to note that lipid A, when it's purified from the other components is almost totally responsible for the toxic amount of any property. The polysacurised component of composed of a four region to which the lipids are attached, and that outer region is er, it extends out into the environment . Now, the importance here is that both of these polysacrulite components are based in general the outer region is highly variable, that's to say that very, er that most of organisms possess a unique outer region to that polysacrulite . And by contrast, the poor region, certainly amongst the grand negative bacilli is very similar across a wide range of different species and this provides a very important opportunity to produce immunity to endotoxin directed against the core and this possibility has recently been exploited by a production of the molecule antibody directed against the core polysacride of the erm er er, of ecoli. So, this has been shown to be effective in moderating the toxic events which occur in grand negative shock. Building on this approach and something which I think you'll see certainly during the course of your your medical studies antibodies directed against tumourler proce , tumourler process factor are now being used to try and interrupt the chain of events at a slightly later stage. So that's that's the endotoxin story. I want now just to summarise and er some of these the features I'm going to point out I've I've already stated so you may may just want to sit back and just take this in. If we compare endo and exotoxins endotoxins are only associated with grand negative organisms whereas exotoxins maybe produced by either grand negative or grand positive. Endotoxins are exclusively cell associated in their production. Exotoxins may also be cell associated, they've, they may not be a sa , they're not a structural component, but, particularly in grand negatives exotoxins er, are released first into the peraplasmic space, the space between the two membranes, and the the actual release into the medium er, may require cell . So,tha they are both cell associated and cell free. Endotoxin from different organisms although it may be of of different potency has essentially the same biological effects. So, a wide variety of different organisms can produce endotoxic shock. But exotoxins from different organisms produce really very different biological effects. Even, even though they may be er,the they may work as a result of different o of the same enzyme activity in some cases the target for that enzyme activity and the receptors that have put it into the specific cells that are targeted lead to really very different biological effects. In general terms endotoxins are a very low potency about point O one of a gram is lethal to one person some exotoxins are incredibly potent, and they're being the, the subject of er a certain amount of er weapons research. The same goes for O one of a gram for example,toxin and it gives you a hundred thousand er as as I've indicated here, there's a, a wide range for the potency. Endotoxins are heat stable, and this is very important when we try to produce materials that are safe for intravenous injection. Whereas, for the most part exotoxins are destroyed by heat into a hundred degrees centigrade. And finally treatment with er formaldehyde or ethanol has no effects on endotoxins but in a number of instances formaldehyde or ethanol will lead to er, the production of toxoid. So, I think you should now have a very clear basis for discriminating between the two sorts of two sorts of toxin. And we can move safely on to another another, and the final really, final topic about the patterns of pathogenesis. Let's move on now, briefly, to consider this disease, tuberculosis. This is a, a normal test x- ray the commonest manifestation of tuberculosis is the disease of des destructive regions in the upper poles of the lungs and pathologically the very nasty destructive lesions er, are appearing in in the area. And in a mi , in a minority of cases you may get a sort of forminant region, this is er small scale, it's perhaps a centimetre apart, across a series of lung lesions containing these little necrotic due to the er the presence of tubercle cila. Although this was this organism, microbacterium tuberculosis, named tuberculosis was discovered back in eighteen eighty we we really understand the pathogenesis of the disease very poorly! What we know for sure is is really outlined here. The organism is in i is inspired into the alveolar spaces and it's taken up by alveolar , the standard er abbreviation for macrophage and, the organism i in contrast to many others which we've sort of er die fairly rapidly after being taken up by these phagocytic cells, says Goodee! That was exactly what I wanted to happen! And it grows very rapidly, within macrophages and after er a period of time is actually disseminated into the circulation. Now, this happens in nearly all er cases o of tuberculosis but, interesting, the vast majority of infections microbacterium tuberculosis are asymptomatic and the reason for that is that after a period of growth and dissemination does not lead to clinical symptoms, cell mediated immunity, C M I, comes into comes into play and you end up with a balance between the macrophages, and fi and M T B, where there's a constant turnover of macrophages dying, and M T B winning out. Excuse me! Hello! Yep? What's the M T B? Microbacterium tuberculosis. Okay. Thank you. You have a balance between the effects of macrophages which have been activated by cell mediator immunity and the lethal effects of microbacterium tuberculosis. In individuals in whom some mediated immunity is not well developed the growth and defemination,de defemination phase may take over altogether. If the C M I doesn't lead to this kind of balance then it can have this sort of effect and get rapidly fatal tuberculosis occurring at the time of the primary infection. But it's believed that the majority of cases of tuberculosis, that we actually see, are so called post-primary tuberculosis where all of this process is taking place asymptomatically and the host is in this state of balance but something else comes along and stresses cell mediated immunity and the control breaks down so that th the organism M T B wins out very dramatically over the, over the macrophages and you end up with this post-primary pattern of tuberculosis. An example of th , of the stress might be the administration of steroids or the occurrence of another disease, most notably, in this day and age of course, aids, would lead to T B coming out in this way. Is this a type of miliary ? Miliary er i it it refers, well you've heard of millet seed and it's it refers to a seeding of many different lesions er, around the body it means the disseminated form of of tuberculosis where the lesions occur all over the place. Mm. You'll hear, you'll hear these things repeated many times again, both in the pathology, and in the microbiology course. So, that's er, really a very different pattern of infections where the virulence factors are not clearly identified. Let me just finish off now by illustrating what leads to the outcome and how a a of a particular infectious condition and the combination of the factors that we think lead to these outcomes. I think, the best analogy I can produce for you is that a a balance in which various factors act on the side of the host and various factors act on the side of the organism, and the outcome is disease and death if the organism wins out and outcome is resistance or recovery if the the host wins out. And we could really, add in for each organism in different weights the significance of each of the factors on each side. So, for example, if we took diphtheria we could say that the toxin was by far the most important and weighty factor, and that if we knock the toxin out then the disease can't occur. And, similarly on the the host side, we could say that antibody was the most important feature. In another example in tuberculosis we could say that the ability of the organism to persist inside macrophages was the most important feature and that effective cell mediated immunity was the most important feature on the host side. So, I hope I've introduced to you the very different styles by which microbes produce disease and indicated the balance of factors involved. Shall we start from the beginning? Yes Right, mm, completely fresh start? Yes please. I was born in Wapping in the year nineteen hundred and six, my father was a docker, one of my earliest recollections is of the dock strike of nineteen hundred and eleven, in which I played a part lining up at the soup kitchens to get soup for the family. My father died when I was quite young and at ten years of age I went into a poor old orphanage where I stayed four years. I came out of the orphanage to go and live with my mother and I found myself one of the family of six living in one room, the house was a four roomed house plus a scullery. Each room was occupied by a separate family, there was one cold water tap for the whole of the four families and one outside toilet. Conditions such as those were quite common to many thousands of people and I think it was those conditions which helped to formulate and develop my political thinking. When I was eighteen I came in contact with the Catholic Crusade which was a rather left wing Christian Socialist Organization and I found that their attitude to problems contained the answers for which I had been searching for a good many years tell me when you want me to raise something. Yeah, I'd like you to tell me about erm, what the house was that you left before you came to Harlow and why you came to Harlow? Yes,if we skip all the intermediate years with, after the war I came back from the army to find we'd been bombed out and were living in requisition accommodation, after a time, the, we were moved into a new flat over some shops. My wife was working for Cossors the electronic company and they moved to Harlow and er, it, in order for her to retain her job, we had to move to Harlow as well. This proved very difficult because, between the time of the decision being taken to move Cossors to Harlow and the time that my wife, my wife's department actually went, the Development Corporation had changed their policy and would not have married women as tenants. This resulted in a great deal of correspondence between myself and the Development Corporation and at the end of it I told my wife the best thing to do was to hand her notice in as there was no chance of us ever getting a house in Harlow, fortunately her services were much more seriously in demand then we imagined and the company nominated us for one, a house which is allocated to one of their executives, the house that we're living in now and have lived in ever since nineteen sixty three. The vast difference between Stroud Green Road, Islington and Harlow. For one thing Harlow is the sort of town which I'd been agitating for both before and after the war whenever I was speaking on behalf of the Labour Party both at street corners and at public meetings on the type of life we vis envisaged for a normal person in the land. To leave Islington, to leave Stroud Green Road, to leave a flat which was over a shop overlooking a main shopping centre, overlooking a completely noisy main through road to come to Harlow was a difference between chalk and cheese. The accommodation differed in, in one respect and that, that was that in the flat we were on one floor, we had one bedroom, we moved into a house with two toilets separate bathroom and three bedrooms, which enabled us to spread our furniture around, enabled us to have visitors to receive members of the family. I think this is one of the essentials in Harlow and something that people should not forget, that is that, although there is a great deal of criticism possibly of the standard of building that went on over the years of the Development Corporation, compared with what most people came from, there was a very great elevation both in quality and in ideas. Perhaps today the general public take too much for granted, the, as a local Councillor I have to interview many people who come to me with housing problems, to be as patient as one can is essential as a politician, but after the complainant has gone, one is very conscious of the fact that their problem is so minute it is hardly worth mentioning. But nevertheless that's human nature and perhaps it's also a reason why life should not stand still, whatever progress we make both in housing and in quality of housing and the quality of life, once people are used to that, to that they expect more and this is what progress, what forward thinking is all about. Could you tell me about the house, of which you were bombed out? Was it, were you married at the time? Yes I think that over the course of our married life we had a number of moves for various reasons, generally to improve the accommodation, erm as standard of life increased so the desire to have a better house to live in or rather in those days a house was out of the question, we generally had rooms in a house, erm, they, the flat for instance that we were bombed out from was a basement flat, erm according to the estate agents it was a garden flat, erm and it meant that you had access to the front garden and the back garden, but as for being a garden flat it was below the level of the garden in the front and at the back it was on the level with the erm green grass at the back of the house, it was also along side of the trolley bus depot, so there it was considerably noisy, nevertheless it was a self contained flat, the first one we'd had, no the second one we'd had and we were perfectly happy there although of course it did have minor difficulties, the fact that you used the front door with people who had flats on the other remaining three floors, but nevertheless it did involve you in a certain amount of community living, you were aware of your neighbours, you had to be very conscious of them and they were very conscious of you. That I think perhaps is one of the striking differences between that and living in a house in Harlow, where you may or may not know your immediate neighbours. Perhaps you know them over the garden wall to speak to you, you might even know their children by name and you know their christian name, but beyond that I think it's true to say, even making allowance of generation gaps that you don't know your neighbours in the same way that you knew your neighbours in London. Whereabouts was the basement flat, was it in Islington No , that was in Islington but it was in the district called Holloway Oh yes I know it well Mm Penventon Gardens Penventon Gardens, is the hou oh of course it's not there It's not there, mm, yeah if it was bombed out yes You were in the army weren't you? Oh I was yes, I was Army I was enjoying life in the army while my wife was enjoying the bombing. She was actually in the house when the bomb dropped on the other side of the road and she was flung down two flights of stairs and the piano on the other side of the room here bears the scars of the bombing. And that curtain went from the window right across the room and pinned itself into the piano, pinned the curtains into the piano. And it also managed to chip some of the woodwork, curious to think that I was offered as war damage compensation five pounds to re-case the piano, you couldn't of had it repolished for five pounds, but thinking was working class people shouldn't have pianos, I'm certain that was at the back of, of the gentleman whose job it was to evaluate war damage, he certainly raised his eyebrows every time we told him, what either a piece of furniture or crockery or cutlery which had been destroyed had cost and he was so foolish after er the house had been almost flattened as de demand bills as proof of evidence that your figures were correct Mm, so when you left your, when you came back you said that you went into a requisition property Yes, erm, we found ourselves in, rather to go back. After the bombing my wife was housed with an with another family Who had been bombed in the top flat, they, they were rehoused in a flat in a block of mansion flats and when I came out of the army this was the accommodation I found available, er for me and I objected strongly and after a great deal of fuss erm the Islington Borough Council's Housing Department found us rooms on the first floor in a Victoria Victorian villa in Penventon Gardens, which erm, were comfortable Not Penventon Gardens Er not erm was that Sunnyside Road Sunnyside Road Sunnyside Road Sunnyside Road, and erm, it were it was good accommodation we had our own bathroom and toilet er but again accommodation was cramped, we had no spare room And we weren't proud, there was people came and er the people in the flat above us had to pass our door to get to them in the same way that we had to pass the people, tenants below doors to get to their accommodation. Erm from there we went into this purpose built flat above a grocers shop, it was meant for the manager of the grocers shop, but he had better sense and so the flat became available for letting to the Borough Council who at the insistence of the owners of the house we were in, erm, were anxious to get their property back and so we found ourselves in a brand new flat, the first tenants, although this was not very highly to be recommended, you approached your flat up er stone staircase, er from the outside so you exposed to the elements er you then walked across the roof, flat roof over the shops until you came to your flat door, erm, Islington at that time was just beginning the, to see the influx of immigrants from the colonies as they were in those days and er, they in turn created much heavier demand on what little vacant property there was, so that the district rapidly deteriorated and for many people who were not in the fortunate position that we were found it necessary or desirable to leave because they were sharing rooms or sharing houses with people whose ways of life were different from theirs and this is something I think that housing authorities learnt to appreciate over the years that the differences between people's ways of life are one of the major causes of social distress. What year was that when you moved into erm Sunnyside Road? We moved into Sunnyside Road in nineteen forty five and we moved into erm Stroud Green Road Fifty three somewhere about nineteen fifty three, yes in our town house and we left Sunnyside Road in sixty three to come to Harlow. So you've only been in Harlow since nineteen sixty three? Twenty years yes Yes it'll be twenty years next March Mhm. Could you explain to me a little bit more when you said that erm a married woman couldn't be a tenant. Yes, erm, when Harlow was designed, it was appreciated that its, the, its purpose was to house workers in the factories and the offices and also to act as an overspill from London, and in nineteen sixty when Cossors were bringing their workers by the hundreds Fifty eight Fifty eight was it? When, in nineteen fifty eight when Co Cossors were bringing, started bringing their workers here the Development Corporation were very anxious to let houses and, so that it, it didn't matter whether the worker was male or female, he or she was accepted as a tenant, by the time we came to move in Harlow in nineteen sixty three the Development Corporation reneged on its promise to house my wife. At that time erm, I was a commercial traveller and Harlow was part of my district and they reluctantly accepted the fact that because I was a commercial traveller working in Harlow that I actually did work in Harlow which was stretching a point, but I really think that the Development Corporation's officials were getting a little tired of my being able to talk their own language and to write letters in the same vein as they could write, they weren't used to this, and, at any rate, as I said earlier we got here. We were offered some awful things though, in the first place Erm, I've always been interested in housing and it did appear to me that however delightful Harlow may be, when the architects were designing properties, they designed a property without any consideration for the people who were to live in them. We were offered a flat, which would of mea if we'd of accepted it would of meant we would have to of sold every stick of furniture because the rooms were not large enough Can you tell me the name of the block of flats or the address of it? That was er a flat in Plumtree, we were offered a flat on the first floor and when we examined the kitchen it was extremely obvious to me that our gas cooker wouldn't fit in the, the place where it was designed to fit, when I asked where do we put the washing machine I was informed that most tenants kept the washing machine on the balcony, when I said well where do we put the refrigerator, well most people keep the refrigerator either in the hall or, or rather not a hall it was a passageway, in the passageway or in the living room, now it does seem to me with hindsight that if that's planning I, to use an old fashion London phrase, I'm a Dutchman. Was the living room a com a com combined sitting and dining room? Combined everything except bedroom, there was one separate bedroom Only one bedroom? Yes erm, it was very obvious from the word go that they didn't want us. It was for a single person really wasn't it there? Well I would of thought so, although today it must be admitted that single people, don't get offered one bedroom flats, but then in those days there wasn't the shortage of accommodation that there is today Next question Erm, could you tell me erm something about how you felt about the change of coming to this house, you know whether you enjoyed it? Well I suppose at the, one of the best things, best examples of the difference was that my wife when she saw this house, knew that it was a house in which she could be happy, in which her tastes and, could spread themselves, erm rather than her tastes having to be curtailed by lack of space and lack of accommodation, erm, the fact that I had a garage which was essential er next to my house instead of some er quarter or twenty minutes' walk away from where I lived as happened in London also made a terrific difference to comfort, erm the fact that there was a garden instead of a few windowboxes and a couple of tubs, all these things I think made one appreciate the fact that you'd come, not only into a new town, but into a new way of life probably the fact that we had a staircase inside the house, which was the first time that we'd had a staircase between our bedrooms and our living rooms Mm so in all purp in, in always, the fact that you'd come into this house made one realize that there'd been a distinct change in one's circumstances. And did you feel that it affected your lifestyle? That you could do, you mention that you could now entertain Erm your friends well we always had entertained friends but we'd never been in a position to put them up so that erm most of our friendly visits were from people who didn't live very far from us, it meant that families, nieces, nephews etcetera were difficult to accommodate because they had to sleep on a couch or a settee in the living room with all its diff difficulties, especially when it meant in the morning for breakfast you had to get them up and dressed before you could start thinking about breakfast, and I think that those sort of things are things that er people ought to take into consideration when thinking about new housing. One of the beefs I have about accommodation for elderly people is the fact that by, that the purpose built, very excellent, bungalows and flats for elderly citizens are restricted to one bedroom which, to which but is by government decree to keep the cost down, but it does seem to me to be very heartless because elderly people's children are unable to come and stay with them except to the great deal of discomfort and perhaps as society grows a little more considerate for the fact that the percentage of elderly people will get even greater as the years go on, then they should make allowance and provide them for the facilities to enable them to be visited by their children and grandchildren. Did you erm leave family behind when you came away from London? No we never had a family so we were entirely foot free and foot loose. But apart from children I meant sisters or brothers Oh yes or parents or yes, erm my wife came from the Midlands, from Coventry and her family roots were in Coventry at the Midlands, in fact there she still has numerous nieces and nephews and great nephews and great nieces there to this day, my with the exception of a sister who moved, who, to Basildon, erm I have two brothers and er they still live in London, still live in East Ham, er the distance is not too great erm and, but obviously as we get older the amount of visiting we do will be constricted by the difficulties of getting from Harlow to East Ham especially when one is compelled to stop driving a motor car Did you bring furniture with you when like when you moved into Harlow? Oh yes, yes, we, the we had an extremely large rooms, I don't know went, what, what, what went wrong the architect but we had two enormous rooms which could of been quite easily divided into three, but we could of had two bedrooms instead of one and the conse Er, sorry to interrupt you are you speaking about this house? No, the flat The flat, right the flat in, in London, the flat we came from and so we had accumulated a little more furniture than one would usually have in two rooms and the kitchen and we got here and were allowed to spread ourselves, if there's one criticism that one could say about this house, is that the size of the rooms confines you to what you put in them, they're square, that the, the division between the living room and the dining room is through a pair of glass doors, where perhaps that could of been arranged with either sliding doors or some other feature so as not to separate it yet again into two square boxes and erm Are you in favour of open plan? er, it depends on one's own tastes, I personally don't like the open planned that I've seen in very modern houses where, erm I, I don't quite know how to express it but it does seem to me odd to be on one floor level and then two feet up you're on another level and er, that's one aspect of the open plan that doesn't appeal to me and I don't quite understand why it's necessary to have everything that's going on in one room with pieces of furniture designed to act as barriers between the different functions or purposes for which you give parts of the room. So how do you how do you see the ideal way of arranging a room? The ideal way, way of arranging a room as I see it would be that you could have your separate rooms but have sliding doors, after all there's nothing new in sliding doors, er, but doors opening and closing erm are restrictive, that's only my own personal view, my wife doesn't necessarily, necessarily share that view ideally if I was planning a house, the main room the main living room would be much larger than the one we live in, it would certainly be a different shape, erm when we had our golden wedding erm our visitors were so numerous that they were standing shoulder to shoulder in these two rooms and the kitchen whereas if it had been a reasonably designed house maybe we could of spread them around a little more, but they're minor, minor defects that are not really serious. I think today that if someone was designing a house one would incorporate all the modern additions which have suddenly become fashionable such as double porches, doubleglazing and er patio windows, I think that these things are perhaps a development from, in the same way as this house is a development from the rooms and the flats we lived in in London so that the modern conceptions of the things I've mentioned could be incorporated as normal in the house certainly would be cheaper to incorporate them when building the house than adding them on. When was this house built? Well I don't know the exact date but I believe this house is some thirty years old, so it was built about nineteen fifty three, fifty two, fifty three Does it have central heating? Does it have central heating? No it has central heating now, but it didn't when we moved in. Did you own the house? No Erm, did the Council put the central heating in? Council put the central heating in when we got advanced in years and when it became necessary in the doctor's opinion for me to have central heating because I had a heart complaint. So it's, the, the Council doesn't install central heating as a matter of course only if it's a special case? The Council has a policy now of bringing all its properties up to date, but priority because they're, bringing the houses up to date will take some eight years, priority is given to elderly citizens and people with medical needs. Do you like the orientation of the house? Do you feel that it's pointing the right way, bringing the sun in through the right windows at the right time of day? That's a little difficult to answer, if you're watching television, the sun can be a nuisance Yes of course when it comes in, pours in those, the house faces west er consequently although it's very pleasant in the afternoon and evenings when you're not watching television erm, it has its drawbacks on the other hand the garden is most unfortunately orientated alright? I think that's a minor problem but perhaps architects now pay a little more attention to and that is that, in the afternoon when you like to sit in the evening when you like to sit in the garden in the sunshine you are sitting in the shadow because the house er is between the sun and the garden I can't think of any more questions for the moment Alright So do you think I could ask you something about what you please tell No we're alright please tell me when you want me to go because Yeah if I over st don't let me over stay No, no, no, no. Er I liked to ask you erm about if you, if you think that Harlow lives up to the ideal of the New Town? It could be asked what is disappointing about Harlow, and I suppose that the first thing that strikes one is the design fault so far is the road work, the road network is concerned and er, and the inadequacy of the road, for roads for modern traffic. Very obviously when this town was designed and laid out and nobody foresaw the growth of the private motor car, er today private motor car is accepted, but in a town which was built perhaps the idea that one in twenty would own a motor car and we're now faced with the probably one in three have a motor car, we're now faced with a problem which can only detract from life in the town, also the fact that huge lorries are passing through what were envisaged as quiet residential neighbourhoods with a consequent breaking of curbs and of paving stones where the lorries are compelled to mount the pavings in order to get round parked cars and things of that nature it detracts from the life in Harlow I do, I think a considerable extent, erm, the other factor is that there's become a lack of pride in the town by the people who live in it, this is seen from the amount of rubbish, and refuse that is dropped from the minor vandalism that goes on the graffiti, er particularly in underpasses where people are walking to the town centre and that, those are the things where the town has lost its way, when we first came here you never saw bits of paper and packages from sweets and cigarettes and things, perhaps maybe because the package industry has developed over the years and that er whereas whenever we had responsibility for taking a small child out, if it had sweets it was encouraged to put the wrappings in its pocket until it got home, now of course it's encouraged to drop it just where it wants to and er this not only applies to children, some of the worst culprits are the adults who leave the, leave the public houses with a can of beer to drink on the way home and drop it just when they've finished the last drop of beer or the fish and chip paper's just dropped. I think this is detracting, I think it's inconsiderate, it certainly shows a lack of respect for one's neighbours or indeed for the town one lives in and yet very often I'm fully aware of the fact that the people who do the dropping are the first to complain that the Council doesn't keep the town clean. What, do you think that there's any connection between what you mentioned before three weeks Yeah. maximum. Erm if it's if you're desperate for them we can rush it in Yeah. a bit bit quicker. Mm. That one is not bad . It's slightly it's slightly I don't know I I still like that one actually I mean w There probably isn't no. That's liable to catch the dust a bit more than that I suppose. Mm. Well you've got to brush on the When they Yeah As long as you do them fairly regularly, you're not going to have any problems as far as erm That's acrylic and the other one you were looking at was fibreglass. Mm. Yes it yes it No I still like that one actually. Yeah. Well it's you know, it's up to you you can look at whatever. I'd give you the discount on that as well. The lakes one was an E No it was a it was an E I think. Oh an E. I think it was an E That would be a hundred and fifty two,two hundred and thirty eight. I'm not so keen on that much of a St I still prefer that. It's difficult isn't it when you've got a Well too much choice bit of choice. is is is fatal isn't it ? We've got Spice and we've got Snowdrop and the expense what was the expensive one? Dune. . You like that? Yeah. Dune. It's just got some . Yeah it wouldn't wouldn't matter if it was cut slightly off square either would it. Well it's not quite and you get the dunes effect when you've Mm. when you've got them all up . Yeah. Oh they th Well of course you will won't you because you're gonna go right the way across. Always assuming they match together. Well no they wouldn't match together but that doesn't matter. Erm might might be a problem for you. No it wouldn't be a problem might be a problem for a my mother Er your mother yes. Mm. Mm. So what would that Well I'll drop that down to a C, that'd be a hundred and fourteen. A hundred and fourteen. Mm. Cos that looks quite a nice one. Mm. I want something really that's not absolutely completely dead plain. Mm. Well Because it's quite a bit window. Yeah. I think mind you the rest of the walls, everything else is white so Want something that's a bit interesting in your living room don't you. Yeah. You know, depending on what kind of decor you have. But you've got white walls Yes. Well I I don't think we can go on any other sort of colour. Mm. Cos I think a big expanse of something that matched this would be awful really. Well I was just I was just thinking, if you had a patterned paper and then you had you're pattern in your Yeah. your blind as well Well yes, I think we'll have to stick to white . I think that's . The background . Mm. well we've got some sort of sorting out and thinking to do haven't we? Yeah, what about the erm oh what do you call the top bit of the rail? Oh the the rail The erm. Yes erm. Wh which side do do do they go to the side? They actually go, you can have them at either side, Yeah. erm you can have your controls at either side, the bunch going to either side. And you can Can you have it going from the middle? You can have the bunch splitting. Cos it being a big window I think Yeah. it's better. I'll just tell you about if you have it splitting. Mhm. Erm the two middle louvres that come together will overlap slightly more than the others. Yeah. Right. So the shadow w when the sun's shining You can see a slightly thicker one. becomes sl er slightly larger. Mm. That's the only er difference with those. But if er if it all going to one side I think it's going to be take up half the window won't it . I think it could be very heavy here wouldn't it. Mm. look better going. It wouldn't quite take up it wouldn't take up half the window . Wouldn't it? No. But a fair amount. It also depends if you have your windows open and you've got them each side and a bit of a wind, they'll be flapping . Yeah. Mm. think about that as well. Mm I I I still think the middle. You want it to open from the middle? Yeah. It's this sense of proportion isn't it? No it's not really what I prefer. Yes. Right. And what about the bottoms? Presumably they're chained . They're they're they're all chained together Mm. with weights. And they they go a hundred and eighty Yeah. degrees? That's right yeah. Cos obviously that's quite necessary . Mm yeah. The way the sun comes. Which end do you want to have the controls? Well it would have to be this end. You want the controls this end? No no sorry same end as the other one, same end yes the same end . Yeah it's a bit more difficult to get in there isn't it. Do you want to order now or do you want a quote? Could you quote ? Probably the best is a quote . And then we'll Cos we've got one more person to talk to Right. yet. Okey-doke. . if you can give us the the two alternatives for the the Dunes one and the Spice Oh I'd better just er . So it's the Dunes is the That one. that one. The dunes is the preferred one. Is the preferred one. And then there's the Spice. Mm. And was it the Snowdrop? No. just those two? Just those two. I like the texture of that other one . Which one? That well the . The Spice one. Spice one but er Yeah. You like the pattern of the Dunes one. Well no it's not that I just think it's the I don't know you can see through it more. Yeah. I Is it Mr ? yeah. As in the flower. And the address again please. . And your phone number? is . Why am I saying all these . With the er white headrail or chocolate brown? White. White? White . That doesn't make any difference to price does it? No. What width are the are the vanes of the the louvres. Er they're five inch. Yeah. These are three and a half so they'd be slightly longer. Yeah yeah. Slightly wider. Mhm. Well I hope they will be slightly longer. . Yeah. Right . You want it split? Yeah. And you want it er controls on the Left. And the other one was Spice White. Right I'll write this out again and if you decide to go ahead, Yeah. then just cross the one out you don't want. Okay. Mhm. Yeah. Otherwise you get two. Yeah. Which could be quite fun. Well you you'd have no problem with sun penetration then would you. No you're right dear. No. That would be We already have a roller blind on the outside I see which is useful for taking the heat off the window itself in the Summer. Yeah. But it doesn't have any effect It doesn't take the light off. . I mean that's got a very open weave texture. Mm. Ten Right, I'll let you fill that in when you're Okay yeah. It's a Newark phone number, yeah? Right. There's a little bit more for you. competition on the toes. Right I'll give you these. Right. Erm if you want to go ahead with it, pull the top one off, Yeah. pop it into one of these prepaid envelopes Right. with the deposit in. And it'll be twenty pound deposit. Twenty pounds . Mm. Yeah. And then as soon as our office gets that it'll be two to three weeks. Right. That says plus thirty, that's that's inclusive . No Well I'll just put it on. Thought thought I'd better ask. Yes yes . Thank you. and that'll be attached and when we come to fit it, if you keep hold of the one you keep Yeah. you needn't sign that now It looks a bit complicated but No no. No not really. got the idea. Well that's marvellous thank you. I've been thinking about these blinds for such a long time. Yeah. Really just I mean a roller blind's just too the window's too wide for a roller blind. And then at least you can see through while you're shading the sun from that direction and then That's right yeah. the other direction. seemed to be the answer. Well thank you very much. Yes, you've got your measure. I've got my measure yeah. Yeah. I've just well and truly broken mine, you know I chipped the end of the Yeah. tape on the it went and did it again on me now and it's well and truly gone I'll have to buy another one. It was a nice idea. put this back. Oh don't worry it's very very it's very easy. There you go. They're all on rollers these days. Oh right. Right thank you very much indeed. Hello there goes the phone . I'll answer it dear Right okay. Come in, come in, come in. nice to see you. Well what can we do for you today? Oh, I've a infection in my gum Dr . In your gum? Up here. Yeah. tablets and noticed that, I don't know,. Let's have a look and see what they've done to you. Aye, the Sofradex not doing very much for that is it? No, I've never taken them, I've just, I stopped taking them. Aye, I don't think they're doing very much, do you. You see I've had it here, I take it quite often, I take Right. sores, Dr gave me these to clear them, and it does clear them up. Eventually. Eventually, Right . but I was getting bacteria and germ, you know, Mhm. and I'd rather so I so I put a description in, asked for a description yesterday, Right. cos that would give the rest of my Right. my things. So she said it wouldn't be done till tomorrow morning, but I need something, Right. And I've been up till, I've been paining me all night Doctor , Aye. I'm just wondering if it's my teeth or that it's just my blood that's doing it . I think I think it might be s the the teeth, it'd be worth getting the er dentist to have a wee look at your your plate, Mhm. because there might be a wee rough It seems to be catching up here. Aye, might be a wee rough bit in It was all rubbing, and really painful all night Dr . And will I take these Sofradex? Yes, yes, keep on with those just now. And I was going to take them, I was going to take them, and I said, Oh I'd better, I'd better see Dr first . Aye, get Daktarin erm gel and put that on Mhm. three times a day between meals. Do I just spread it on my plate, you know? Aye, just a wee drop on your A wee drop, on on your finger and just cotton bud it and rub it ? and and rub it round top of your plate, just put straight from Awfully painful. Oh aye because you're right into the flesh. It is. Right into the flesh. Do I take these as they're prescribed here Doctor ? Yes, aye, two fou one or two four times a day. Yes, one four times a day. Fine, yeah, aye . Just take, just take, I was gonna take them, I says,I couldn't stand the pain any longer, Yeah. it really was, put me off food and everything Dr . Aye, oh yes, when you can't, when you can't eat it's not much fun. Here we are now. And how's, how's young Dr doing, is he? Dr , is he doing alright ? haven't seen him, it's Dr I think that's attended me the last time. Aye. I haven't seen him, I think I've doc seen Dr once. It was a wee, it's it was last year when you saw him I think, Dr No. , was it not? No because I got my gallbladder out in January. Aye. It's it was before So that that you'd seen him. Aye. Seen that much That looks like Dr . Ah I seen . That's right. Aye, it was November, November. the last time you saw Dr Oh it was Aye, well I seen him, He came up to see me when I was in , Mhm. when I was in getting my gall bladder removed. It's turned you into a human being yet? Oh No. Will I just pout the gel on or Yes. can I? Just just put the gel, don't don't wash your mouth out with anything. No, I was using some, I was washing with a mouthwash in the morning. No, Oraldene. no. No? No. Leave it, leave it alone, Leave it? leave it alone. Use your Yes, aye, just use your gel and your your er Sofradex tablets, yeah sofradex tablets, just take what's in the just take what's . I seen Dr , Monday, he was a clinic for before I went beck, a week on Friday for injections. Again? Again. Absolutely. In the bin. That's the best place for it. took him two reactions, Aha. to get platelet, to get platelets, two reactions . I must have screamed. Away and yourself. Right Thanks very much Doctor, thank you. Bye Mrs , cheerio now. Right, erm, eighteenth of January, er, Department of Finance and Administration Cascade Meeting. Er, Great North House, Northern Development Company. O K Marion, would you care to kick off? Yes, O K, erm, I brought what I thought would be a help from last week. Did your report back?we didn't have a meeting the first week, did we? Marion? and I wasn't in the last week so I doubt whether Do you want one on last week?, It's all there I assume, O K, right, O K, yes Erm, the quarterly report went out towards the end of that first week, erm, with the annual finance statements, erm, we're ple , quite encouraging because of the erm, S and E enquiries, were actually done on his proportion for once. Only just, but, because er, a hundred and eleven, if the enquiry's a hundred and six or constitutions, which is quite good, and obviously December was really quiet but then that's standard anyway, because , quite possibly not because it was sort of erm, he's shown with an which didn't So it's something folded back on one side yes,? I mean it's not that vital to me, but I hadn't Yes Yes. , but I'm not surprised, so, erm, in our previous visit they did give us Then was down in Middlesbrough for a couple of days that week, and er, I think amused everybody by calling it miserable all the time, I dread to think what . I told you how he was on the phone that day, I mean, he hadn't the foggiest idea of what, what he was doing or where he was going, I don't know. I think he got on er, quite well down there, because he'd spent a few days up here he had a better idea of what he wanted to ask, and what he wanted to talk about and so on, but erm, only because his deadline's and do you want to ring? Ah, right, I don't, I think it's now been called regional Christmas Day Makes a lot more sense, O K At Mercury, he clocked the sponsorship erm, late last year. Right, I must get some literature actually from Barry because as you know, it, it, we can't get it all out of the now, Right, oh and Phil went to the Stoke conference on that Thursday and Friday. He got bored silly and considered it a complete waste of time. Which I did try to tell Erm, I seem to remember that's the day that East Anglia kind of just disappeared in Mm, yes, yes. That's right, I was supposed to have a meeting on with erm, a couple of guys from the British Coal Enterprise down in Middlesbrough with , but unfortunately again the weather caught all of them out and they decided not to come, but didn't occur to them to say they wouldn't come, so I sat down there for an hour, and eventually managed to find a phone number and get in contact and the guy was still there, and he said oh no I'm not coming up. This was like quarter to twelve, he should have been there at eleven o'clock. No he got stuck in London the night before because of the bad weather, and he started saying oh I'm sorry I don't think I'm going to be able to make it. Well I said, I was a bit concerned, I said it would be nice if you could let us know and Especially since you travel er, er, twenty or thirty to get there. Yes, that's right, yes, I mean until you get there. I mean he knew that because he'd contacted me up here and I said well, to make it easier for you we could meet in Middlesbrough, save you coming up from er, Mansfield. I said well, it cuts the, it cuts the journey in half then. I wasn't too happy about that but never mind. Erm, what else, last week I had a meeting with Mike and Yvonne from D T I and Phil. I was looking forward to talk a bit about er, what they're doing er, in the way of seminars and so on this year and how we can tie in with it, and how we're going to erm, actually take over the forum plan for Eurofile. It's typical, they just accepted it all, so it didn't really achieve a great deal, but Mike told me quite a lot of things that I don't really have any idea, or I didn't know about, What achievement of financial business will four year plan, will it make anything else? I can't see that they can afford to be a high profile company? They're going to erm, they're going to give the money towards running a forum, but not a great deal, and then it doesn't even cost that much, it just really a question of erm, mailshots and twice yearly events or whatever. You don't think it'll be once they put the money Yes, so it's, you know, it's like two mailshots up once a quarter or whatever,minutes, and I'm paying for a lunch. you're thinking of direct costs, but erm, Phil was going to ask Jeff if he would chair it, and also if he'd be willing, to be sort of editor in chief, of Eurofile, so that was yesterday, and I haven't seen Phil since, don't know what happened with that and went to him that it was a briefing meeting. yes This individual just about won, in fact it was over by ten past two. Yes, Oh I, yes, I can see here, yes, that's only two It's more than I saw of him. Mhm, Why I'm not sure Walkies But erm, yes, so I still don't know what's happening with that yet, and I'm waiting also for them to confirm a date for this first sort of Do Business in France seminar, that we're going to help them with, which was originally going to be February, and is now going to be March. We think it was going to be the seventh and the eighth and the ninth, and they've told Newcastle City it's the ninth, but she was meant to confirmed last Wednesday, and she's still not. So erm, I've had a word Are export involved in this, I mean it seems quite if they're not? Mm, yes, but the trouble is they're not going to be interested in Europe, so they're not, Western Europe . They don't know how useful it would be but anyway, they said there, there's, it's a slightly odd event because it's actually going to be just in the Civic Centre, and er, and kind of tacking on some workshops and things, so I'm going to help her with workshops and have a display stand and so on but other than that, we've not really got any direct input into it, because it is very much, sort of, you know, this is how you do business in France, these are the financial problems, type of thing. It's just a good workshop,yes Which I was for shying off anyway, because I don't think it's any of our, our business. I'm mean they've got export people that know about that, and E C people one of those things. Yes, that's right, so I said you know, it's on a general level, I said yes, fine. But, er, other people start bringing up sort of problems with the French tax situation on such and such a structure of company or whatever, which is not anything we want to get involved with. So I had a meeting with Dailey to talk about the workshops and so on, so we've bashed out the format and er, and what we think we'd like to do, but it's partly dependent on D T I, because it is their event, and we want to be seen to hijack it. Erm, I had a meeting with Ian and erm,Do , Dorothy. Mhm, and told them that you wouldn't be your present arrangement Erm, yes, quite They took it remarkably well really, but er, I think there needs to be soft There must be have contingency, because Anne'd go up the wall over that. You know, I don't know it was sort of well, have a little bit of a boss at Bill then, as a restraining influence in the past I'm no help either, I did sort of wonder what she'd say but she's. They've been sort of so falsely jolly in the past, it sickens me. Get into Microfit, when you're in the data input menu I'd like you to call up the file Q M four FIT Q M four FIT file file . If you just look at the er the sheet, that we've handed out, they loaded from er from the computer it's that data that's in front of you, right, we've got three, three series, right, it's times data, right, from nineteen twenty three to nineteen forty five, right and the three variables are, textile consumption,United States er real, sorry is benevolence of the U S, so it's textile consumption,capita, real income er per capita income to be adjusted through inflation, so constant money terms and what the relative price of textiles P erm the price of textiles relative to the general level er the general price level. Okay what we're going to be doing is estimating a demand function so we can specify the textile consumption as a function of real incomes per capita and also relative prices, alright. A priori, what sign would we expect on those two variables? Say the income, what sign would you expect to observe? Yeah positive providing textiles are a normal good, you should observe positive er income consumption response okay. How about prices?what code, what sign do we expect on the er the price variable there? Yeah negative, right, textiles rise faster, the price of textiles rises faster than the general price level, the real increase in textile prices, therefore, we'd expect providing the first law of demand holds, that we get a negative response consumption, right. So that's what we expect a priori a positive coefficient, a negative, coefficient, positive on income, negative on prices. What we are actually going to do today is to look using this data, is to look at structural stability, right, we're going to ask ourselves are the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample, are they constant over time. There's no point in estimating a model if in reality those coefficients are not fixed, they're jumping all over the place. Right with those parameters, so if you just look at the er coefficional income, if we estimate the coefficional income to be nought point five right, over the entire sample, the then subsequently find out if that coefficient varies from year to year from minus six plus ten, right, having a one point estimate, right, er oh that coefficient is not going to be particularly useful to us, we want to know er whether our coefficients remain reasonably constant throughout our sample period, particularly if we're using this er equation to make out of sample predictions, right. The first thing we must er be sure of is that the coefficients within the sample are reasonably, er reasonably constant, right. If they are not reasonably constant, then not only is the model er a poor one, right, within sample but it can't really be used for out of sample predictions, because although on average er our coefficient that we estimate it might be nought point five, then the out of sample could well be minus six or something like that. Right, so you need to know that our model is characterized by constant parameters over the sample. Now the data that we've got here has been artificially generated. the last six observations of it has, right, the first six observations, sorry the er the first twenty odd observations are real, right, that they haven't been made up but the last six observations have been made up, right, to er to illustrate structural change. We will assume that we don't know that there is structural change in this data, although a priori, we might expect it. Why, why might we expect structural change to occur in this example? Anything in particular? Okay, yeah, that's right, this s this series a particularly volatile period of economic history in the nineteen thirties, the Great Depression, in addition what's at the end of the series? Yeah the Second World War, right, so er I can tell you now that in actual fact there's no structural change during the thirties here but there is structural change during the war. Textile consumption, or the parameters that we estimate during peacetime no longer er explain textile consumption during wartime. Right, I'm going to go through methods of how we can detect structural change by the non constant parameters. The first thing we'll do is look at the data, alright, so if you go from the action menu into option one, right, we're going to plot er go through to the transform edit option, go into the data processing environment, right, where your three variables are listed T C I P. Right, if you just give the command Plot T C Plot space T C then press the return key right, that's textile consumption over our sample. Now it's not immediately obvious from that time series that there's a structural break, right, textile consumption hasn't fallen dramatically, right, or risen dramatically over the post war period, oh sorry du during the er the war period. Nevertheless we can show that there is significant structural change er in the model that we'll estimate. Right, so by looking at the graph, I am just trying to impress upon you that structural change cannot always be spotted simply by looking at the data right, anyway, let's now move on to estimate our first model. What we are going to be doing is trying to explain that series, right that er consumption series. So if you press the escape key we'll go back to the data processing environment, right. What we're going to do is to log all our variables, right, so if you let L N T C equal open brackets T C close brackets, right, we going to define a new variable L N T C. That's going to be the natural logarithm, right, of our original series T C textile consumption. If you now plot L N T C right, if you plot L N T C you should have a very similar graph to the one that you had before. Alright, logging the data doesn't change the nature of the data, what it does do is that it re-scales the data, okay so the only thing that's, that's, that's changed by logging, right, is the scale of the cr is the vertical scale on the graph, right, but essentially we are still trying to model the same series and N T C is essentially the same series as T C. Okay, so if you press the escape key, once you've had a look at the data, er if you log all the other variables er if you let L N I equal log open brackets I close brackets let L N P equal log open brackets P close brackets, press the return key. Okay has everyone created those three variables in logs? Okay, right what we are going to er do now is create a constant, we'll need a constant for our regressions so if you type the letter Q to come out of the data processing environment right type the letter Q right and then go into the er constant creation menu, which is option one of the data processing menu right,you'll, you'll be asked for a name for if you like call it C or constant or Fred Bloggs, just supply a name to your constant term. By the way has everybody changed erm the password or their password, have you changed it to your date of birth, have you all done that because if you haven't, you've only got six grace log-ins on erm where your password is your user name. If you don't change your password within six er times of logging in then you will be excluded from the network. So you won't be able to log on to Microfit? Right,okay, so has everybody created a constant right, what we are going to do now is to er estimate the first model right equation one on the sheets that you've been given, alright, you've created a constant, we've got our variables L N T C L N I L N P right so if press the letter Q to quit from the data processing environment and press the return key, head towards the action menu, right, when you are in the action menu, go to option two, which is the estimate option, right, and you should then be given a dialog box. If you then specify your equation, so it's L N T C your dependent variable space, whatever the name you called your constant then L N I space L N P. Now just specify the variables that you want in this regression, right, your dependent variable first okay when you've specified the equation, sorry once you specify the equation press the end key which is between the alphabetic and the numeric key pads, that will then submit that request, right. If you then er, it will then ask you over what period do you want to right so if you press the end key that will submit the job erm it asks for the sample period, we're going to use the whole of the sample, so if you just press the return key, that's the default for the whole of the sample, right, it then asks you what procedure you want to use to estimate the model, we're going to use O L S option one, just press the return key O L S then the computer has estimated the model, right. Before we move on, let's just have a look at those numerical estimates, can we look at the coefficients on income, notice that in this model because we've logged both dependent and the independent variables, right, the coefficients that we estimate are elasticities, right, so we can read those coefficients off directly as elasticities and that's the case for any model in which all the variables are logged right, in er, if we didn't log the data, in order to calculate the elasticity we have to multiply a coefficient the computer gives us by a erm price quantity ratio, price less, less part of the income constant ratio to obtain the income elasticities. Alright but in any double logged mode, right, the coefficients you estimate are elasticities, so we look at the incoming elasticity, we get a measure, or we get an estimate point six eight, right, that's a positive as we would expect suggesting that er erm textiles are a normal good, right. Notice that an incoming elasticity is less than unity, and that's less than one, as a result textiles, textile industry in the Netherlands is going to be a declining sector in the economy, right, as incomes er per capita G D P rises, the textile sector will benefit, alright, because, because human demand for textiles either they're demanding proportionately less of any increases in incomes. Right, then so as a result the textiles would be a and relative decline to the rest of the economy. Is that a T ratio on that incoming elasticity? Is that coefficient statistically significant, is it significantly different from zero? Our estimate incoming elasticity, just the T ratio would you say. T ratio of one point four nine. Typically we use the rule of thumb to statistical significance so if we have a T ratio that's less than two we can infer that that coefficient to which the T ratio is attached is not significantly zero. In actual fact our incoming elasticity there with er nought point six is statistically significant zero, eighty five percent confidence level. Confidence right the figure in the square brackets next to the T ratio gives you the significance level of the coefficient, right. We normally use the five percent significance level or the ten percent significance level which corresponds er ninety five percent confidence or ninety percent confidence right. So this T ratio on income elasticity is for the bit right and if we were using the five percent or ten percent as our sort of cut off point, we'd actually discard income from our consumption, from our demand function. Now as economists we should have strong prides about income in this model, we would all, we would expect income to be very important in explaining textile consumption although the model is telling us at the moment, income doesn't seem to be significantly explained in textile consumption so that's something to worry about, we're getting some, er sort of peculiar results here. We now look at the er price unity as a T ratio minus ten, right, so it's highly significant, right and the er figure in square brackets, the probability value next to the T ratio tells you that we get least ninety nine point nine percent confidence coefficiency price elasticity demand significantly different from zero right, now is everybody happy interpreting the coefficient right and the T ratio? If not say now and we can go through it. It is vitally important that you know how to distinguish a statistically significant coefficient, right, rule of thumb is that the T ratio has to be greater than two with absolute value right and the figures in square brackets next to the T ratios tell us the exact level of significance, right, er of that coefficient, right, so the incoming elasticity of demand is statistically significant from zero only at the eighty five percent level, a correspondence of fifteen percent significance that incoming the price elasticity demand, highly significant, right, significance level as given by the probabil by the probability er unit in square brackets, the timing level therefore we could be very highly confident about that coefficient okay. So we've got this model, right, we've estimated the model, let's now have a look at the plot of actual and predicted. So if you press the return key right, we just get a whole list of diagnostic test statistics that we won't look at at the moment, press the return key again, come to the post regression menu, you go into option three which is a list plot option. Now the plot actual and fitted, right, so we try to explain the actual block of textile consumption as the blue line and to do that we are using our model with those fixed estimates, the incoming elasticity and the price elasticity. As you can see there, the model is breaking down during the latter period of our sample. The notice that appears to track the data quite well up until about nineteen thirty, right and then after nineteen thirty it seems to get progressively worse. Now we may suggest that that's the effect of the Second World War biasing alright biasing the estimates that we've just produced from the whole sample. Now because I'll leave that for a moment right, so one way we may test the structural change, right, is to construct what's called a dummy variable and a dummy variables in a wide variety of applications they can be used to er get rid of er outlying observations, very very high or very very low observations. They can also be used for tests for structural change, right, what we're going to do is to say during peacetime right, we'll estimate our model, we'll then estimate our model during wartime and we're going to assume that the coefficients or the income and price elasticity mark, don't change during between peace and wartime, all that happens is as they intercept this model shifts, right, now you may thinks that's not particularly er attractive, you might expect the price of income elasticities to change between two periods and we could actually use dummy variables to see whether that is the case, right, however, we'll get very similar results, right, if you just use a slope dummy so it'd intercept dummy, right, and all that's going to do is to say, well the model runs like this in peacetime, right, and then wartime it suddenly shifts up or down depending on the effect of er of the war on textile consumption. Right, so what we're going to do is create a dummy variable to test that hypothesis, right, so if you press the escape key, right, and work your way back towards erm the data processing sort of environment, so go back to the post regression menu through the backtracking menu erm, when you're in the backtracking menu, go to option six, which is the process plot edit option right, now press the return key in the data processing menu, right, and that will get you to the data processing environment when we can start messing about with our variables. Right, what we are going to do now is create a dummy variable, right, let's call it D one right so if you type D one equals zero and press the return key what you created there, right, is a new variable called D one and it assumes the value of zero, right, what I want you to do now is to edit this variable, so type edit space D one press the return key right, if you type on edit space D one you'll then get a sheet that has all the observations for our variable D one. Using the cursor key move down to nineteen, the observation for nineteen forty right when you've done that type the letter one and then press the return key, right, and you'll see that the observation is changed, right, from zero to one. Move the cursor to nineteen forty one, right, and then press one again, press return key. Just go through the remainder of the, of the observations, so that you should have zeros up until nineteen forty and then at nineteen forty through to nineteen forty five, right, you have ones. When you've finished doing that, press the end key. Right the end key will save the edit that you've just made okay. Right, what we're now going to do is incorporate that dummy variable as the regressor in our model as an explanatory variable, so what's going to happen is that that dummy variable is turned off, alright in the first part of the sample right up until the war that dummy variable's going to be off, right so it has a value of zero, right, then in nineteen forty through to nineteen forty five it's switched on and what it's going to do is to pick up any differential effects, right, in the intercept between wartime and peacetime right, we'll talk a little bit more, more about that in a second, we're going to add it in as a regressor, right, because it only comes on during the wartime it will pick up any shift in the intercept, right, that occurs due to the war if there is one, of course there may not be but it's quite likely that there, there may well be, so if you type Q to come out of the data processing environment, go back to the action menu and test estimate forecast okay at the dialog box just add D one to your list of explanatory variables, alright then press the end key, right, yeah we're gonna use the full sample right, we gonna use O L S, right you have now estimated the model with this dummy variable now just to see what's happened to those coefficients the er incoming elasticity was at nought point six is now doubled right to one point one four more importantly, right, its T ratio has jumped from one point eight five right to six point eight, as a result, we now say that the incoming elasticity, the income coefficients, right, the significant zero, it's important to explain the textiles as such the er, we are now getting a very different estimate for our our estimate for price elasticity is four and one to nought point eight minus one is one point eight, notice though that its ratio has jumped considerably or has doubled and the dummy variable itself is very significant the T ratio ten the coefficient on that dummy variable tells us the effect of the war on textile consumption, right so on average textile consumption rose by point two er see what the units of measurement are we don't actually have units of er ah so we'll elasticity whatever it's multiplied by That's right if you er so this point two quantifies the effect of the war on our equation, and where is the so the intercept, well what you're saying is in peacetime the intercept is equation three point one seven, however, in war time the intercept shifts up and is now three point one seven plus point two, You could draw it like that you could say that this is the the war which cuts in this time of year line shifts up, Yes. so if you wanted it back, you would actually get a new value for the intercept which increases by nought point two three point Three point one okay so this is where the model, in effect what we've done which is a very crude way, right, of erm incorporating exogamous influences, right, we haven't said tha that the war is going to affect the income or price elasticity what we did do, right, all that we're doing is that we're allowing the intercept of our model to change, right, now as a result, we've got, we can prove the st the statistical significance of all the variables in our model, right, the co the actual coefficients that we've estimated have changed quite significant, particularly in the er the incoming elasticity, right, the incoming elasticity was less than one, right, and insignificance before was now greater than one and height of R squared has also increased dramatically our measure of explanatory power. Now if you just press the return key a couple of times right, and have a lot of actual and fitted, if you go into option three in the data post depression menu you will notice that the fit of our model is very very different right, so we are now getting a very very good correspondence between actual and fitted, notice that in our original model the thing started to break down at about nineteen thirty, right, just by allowing the intercept to vary, right, over the wartime we've now got a much better fit throughout the whole period why is that the case? Why are we now getting a much better fit throughout the entire period simply by incorporating the dummy variable to the war period? Any suggestions? Well what's happening is it the, during the war, right, we're constraining the computer to estimate, like a single coefficient that is applicable to both war and peacetime er isn't the case, right,th there is a structural change, right, so when th when we constrain the computer to estimate the coefficients throughout the whole period, right, the coefficients are biased but if they don't apply either to the post er pre war peacetime sample neither do they er fit very well to the data during the wartime, right, if we allow the intercept to change but we're getting much better estimates both wartime and peacetime er parameter's okay because we haven't got rid of, we've got rid of that bias, right, in constraining the parameters to fit both wartime and peacetime er time periods. Okay, erm on this sheet, I don't think, well we won't go through it now because we've run out of time. On this sheet, on page two, we've er, we've performed equation two, right, on the sheet and the second page and it says that there's, there are two alternative ways of testing for structural change using dummy variables. One is to include corporate dummy variable of the intercept and see whether it's T ratio or significantly different, is, sorry it's greater than two right or we can use an F test, right, now that F test that's given me that formula in the middle of the page is a very important test which was developed by a chap called Chow and as a result it become known as the Chow test and it's a, it's a test for parameter constancy, er do we have constant parameters in our model now it tells you how to compute this Chow test, in this particular case we're only dummying the intercept, the Chow test gives exactly the same results of T tests, right, erm we won't bother going through it, if you want to go through this er sheet in your own time calculate that, that Chow test and essentially what it involves is splitting with the s the whole sample now into two sub-samples, right, the first sub-sample, right, is peacetime, the second sub-sample wartime, right, and you just compare the residual sum of the squares on the unaccounted for variation, right, between actual and fitted values, just compare the residual sum of squares between these two sub periods, right and if you use the formula that's given there that will come out with exactly the same result, well in actual fact you can square, if you square the F statistic you get calculating one formula you will get T value, got from er the computer right, the er, the sheet goes on to say how we can er use dummy variables in slightly more complicated ways, right, we could see actually see whether the income or price elasticities of demand changed. Right, instead of letting the intercept change we could just let er our elasticities change. Anyway that's preferable because that's actually what's, what's happening, right, the war is likely to affect the elasticities of demand rather than this er bizarre concept intercept erm and the, the sheet on page three tells you how, how to do that okay. But essentially all these tests do the same thing because they're seeing whether the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample are robust over all sub-samples, right, we can't, we wouldn't bother testing over all sub-samples though we can do, it's just if we have good reason to believe that behaviour in one sub-sample different for behaviour in another E G use er Chow test or equivalently a dummy variable on the intercept to see whether there was any change. Right, okay we'll leave it there, if you just press the escape key and then work your way out of Microfit towards the action menu, exit from Microfit and don't forget to log out of the network. Okay, feel free to come down here at any time with this sheet and er going through the, the examples in greater detail Q M four FIT was the data file, you'll always be able to access, right when you've logged out of the network feel free to go and a merry Christmas, see you next year. It wouldn't be any bother to me, if you Mm. Wanted me to. Well we'll do that, I see what see says any rate on Monday. But I don't think we should give her too long, cos she's got herself into . Mm . Yes . Yes . Keep putting up, we've had her for about two years haven't we? Yes, she did say last time one of her friends would like the job. Oh god. Oh no, no. She's told them how easy it is. She's told them what to do, birds of a feather. Yeah,. Rose would you consider a man, I've got an idea there might still be a possibility of Mr Well I don't see why not, if he, if he did . Some men are very good . Mm. Some men are very good, we've got a good one at the church hall pub next door, I mean. Mm. Toilets and things there. That's right. Yes, I mean that would be very good . I think . I'll have words with Sharon on Monday and er, oh I can't, yes I can on Monday I'm having my hair cut later, but I can come up about nine o'clock and see if she's here. I bet she won't be. No, I bet. She'll be in the penny farthing then. Well, I will then have to ring her won't I? Mm. So will you all get round to your limerick's please ladies. . Thank you all very much. Thank you. Elsie, oh. All right sit please. I've checked your books and I have to say that I'm very pleased. Worked very well most of you erm Rachael you weren't here last week were you? What five S, this is five S five you were over there. Er . Oh well it doesn't matter. We've got . . Yeah . I'll explain later. So this this is five S? Yes. Right. Mrs . Okay . Right if I can give Ken those to give out. Erm and while Ken's giving them out let's try and remind ourselves what we talked about last week. The rule is I ask and you put your hand up. What did we talk about last week? Chris. The universe. The universe. What is the universe? Louise. Er the universe is er planets. Is it? Is that all it is? No hand up. Jennifer. The universe is everything. Everything absolutely everything. How big is the universe? Phillip. No one knows. Nobody knows. What's that word, who was that put that word up that was it you Phillip? Er what was that word you you used last week? Infinitive. Infinitive. The universe is infinite we don't know. When we look out of the window at night what do we see? Jody. Stars. Stars. What are those stars? Suns. Suns. Not all of them most of them are. Some of them are? Alan. Planets. Planets. How many stars are there? Come on everybody's hand should be up, how many stars are there? It's that word again isn't it? Infinitive. We can't count them because if we could count all the ones that we could see there's still plenty beyond those. What's the nearest star to us. What's the nearest one? Louise. Is it the sun? The sun. The sun. Our sun. Well why can't we see stars during the day. If we look out at the sky why can't we see stars during the day? Steven. It's too light. It's too light and where's that light coming from? The sun. The sun. Our star is too bright for us to see stars from further away. Do you know why we can see them at night and not at day time. Why is the sun bright during the day time? Does it switch off at night? That's what we've got to go on to. I'm just wondering how much you know already. Kieran. The earth turn round . The earth turns round so we're in a shadow. Host stars will have what going round them? The moon. Not the moon no. Phillip. . Try. You're doing really well. Planets. Planets. How many planets has our sun got that we know about because there might be some we don't know. Lee. Nine. Nine. Nine that we know about. Which one are we? What's the name of our planet? Katrina. Earth. Earth. How where do we come in the order of nine? Are we furthest away, nearest, in the middle?. Third. Third. And you wouldn't remember just how far away we are would you? You, come on. One hundred and fifty million kilometres. A hundred and fifty million kilo kilometres. I think you deserve a house point there. What house are you in? . . Oh go on then. Hundred and fifty million kilometres from the sun. And what does the sun do for us? Er gives us energy. Gives us energy. What sort of energy? Sun light and . Light. Katrina. Warmth. And warmth and without those we can't live. Light and warmth. Without the light plants couldn't live and without plants we couldn't live. Do you think we could live on another of the planets then? What's the one nearest the sun can anyone remember? Stacey. Mercury. Mercury. What would it mean being nearer the sun? What would it mean about that planet compared with earth? We wouldn't be able to live. Why? It would be too hot. Oh lovely and warm a nice sun tan. No? . Er it's, what are you saying? I mean are we talking it's a lot hotter, too hot. What would happen to us? We could die. We . All right so we can't go that way it's too hot. What's the next one to Mercury? Venus. Venus. Venus. That's about the same size as earth you know. Mercury's very small but Venus is is roughly like us. How about that one then. Could we live on Venus? Do you think? No. No, why not? Because we're we're in the exact spot where we've got enough warmth and Exactly. That's a good point. We're here because we're suited to being here. If we sh wanted other conditions we'd live on a different planet or we would have developed on a different plant. We have to be exactly where we are. Earth's just the right place. Let's just see how smart you really are then. You've done Mercury which is nearest before. You've done Venus, what comes next? Er there are some hands that aren't up. Come on what comes next, what's number three? Number three in charts for the last million million years Michael. Mars. You've missed one out. Oh sit down. You're life doesn't depend on being asked to answer this question because you know the answer. Oh I'm going to ask somebody who hasn't got their hand up. Kendal. Earth. Earth exactly. Right Mercury, what comes next I've forgotten? Erm mars. Steven. Venus. Venus. This is? Come on Jenny. Earth. Earth. Now Michael. Mars. Mars and we don't know any moons do we? Yes. Er d'ya mind, I'm the teacher. If I say you don't know you don't know. You don't know, Lee. You don't know what comes next, you don't. What is it? Jupiter. Is it? Yeah. We wrote it down in our book last week. All right. Erm what comes after Jupiter then? Look at them all looking through their books for goodness sake. Lee. Saturn. Saturn. What comes after Saturn. Uranus. Uranus. Neptune. Neptune. Pluto. Pluto . That's fairly straight forward then. Yes Mr . Yes Mr . Kieran says we're on earth we belong here this is the perfect place for us. Jennifer how far are we from the sun? One hundred and fifty million kimome Kimometres. Kimometres Kilometres. Yes and I'm gonna give you this sheet which it's to save time for drawing it. This is where you now need to concentrate. What we've done so far is dead easy. Because it's not as simple as it looks on this sheet. What's at the centre of our universe? Not our universe our solar system sorry. Kieran. The sun. The sun. Our sun our star. Is there somebody sit there going ? Think, does it? No. No it doesn't. What does the sun do? Gives us light and . It does but that's because it's like a huge atom bomb flowing hydrogen all the time. It moves around in space, it's moving all the time. All those stars are moving. Not quickly as far as we can see. Don't get upset you're not going to disappear one night. All right concentrate. The sun is moving, it's also turning, spinning, like a ball spinning on your finger. What are the planets doing? Revolving . They are spin not all of them. Not all of them. Now that's a little thing you might want to check if you've got an atlas at home. Some of them don't revolve don't spin in their axis. Earth does. What else are they doing, apart from those that spin? Yes. Moving. Moving. And they're moving around the sun. What do we call the path that they follow? When something's going round something else, do you know the word? Oh no. Try it. Solar. No that's that's to do with the sun. That's what we talked about last time yes. But if you know it. What about space craft? Space craft goes up and when it gets to a certain height above the earth it just goes round and round and round. What do we say it's doing, what what is it in? Come on star trek, when he parks his star ship what does he say? We're in? Space. Well yes you're in space. Pardon? Well hardly ever our watch. Orbit. Orbit. They're in orbit. Orbit means you go round and round and round and round and round. Because you're held there by all these planets and stars pulling at you. And that's what holds these planets. The sun has its own gravity. Do you remember me mentioning that? And it's trying to pull the planets in, Lee, but other stars are pulling them and stopping them falling into the sun. All different distances away from the sun and there's Jennifer's a hundred and fifty million millimetres. All going round hell no I don't think it's in there, it's just description stuff, sizes and what have you maybe on the right section there, it's the one where you might wire the L J Us up as well, that's section, ah I think it is, that's it the one with the M B F to what's that? Station socket Right box extension belt there it is next page there you go hear that mate, it just goes in there look, and that, oh hang on a minute no it don't that goes to the bell, through the bell, back out again and then er Come out through the bell, back through the bell on to there and back to there That's right through this big that's right, so you'll probably only just seeing Yeah circuitry there and then there's your, your data which you, you do parallel off Yeah like a yellow and that just says ring, ring, ring that brings the lane and it just does that, that's that belt, all it's doing is taking it through them relay contacts Yeah mm I see which is why you don't see a voltage at the same leg really Yeah fucking weird though innit why it should suddenly start pulling like that That's the way they are, have, have you any extension, extensions put in? Tell you what it could be, ah hang on a minute, I ordered an extension for a bloody for a phone for that office, it could be the phone that's doing it in that office there I know, I know it could be corrupting, you know on the mark one the big one, the old generation mark one It's been going on for months Has it? Two or three months Oh two or three months Yeah, but it's got worse and worse Oh right, yeah and he said it's got worse since he got the new switchboard operator, which makes you think She's probably putting calls, she ain't cos we've tried it over there, you pressed intercom, put it down, it, it does that Shouldn't do that should it? No, I tell ya, there's about four in the company started doing it altogether, oh this is about the fourth one I think why that's what third told me I was talking to Brian day before yesterday, second line, he says there's loads of them doing it and it can't be cured Well all we can do then is reset innit? Yeah, let's do a system reset and you sure you put everything back together that end first Very careful, we'll do that when we get over there, ha Let me get me glasses it looks more like the Selby's one than the erm, than the environmental Oh, I mean cos the main environmental was er, it did it on its own, with a completely empty switchboard, no calls on five o'clock at night, everybody had gone home and the bloody thing would just sit ringing, ringing, ringing, ringing and erm I know this is only when the switchboard's busy Yeah, well you know this, this Selby's one that was the same, when the switchboard was busy it would er, if you, if you sees line three and played it down, well if anybody sees line three and played it down it used to do that or if you sees the intercom that did it, says it's more like the Selby's one than the new one Well I and that was incurable well that was only there If you see line three on You got the key? You've got it I ain't got the key I ain't got the key you had it You put it in your pocket I didn't you've got it Right then, what you got there for? better tell them first You tell them can we just switch the phones off for a couple of minutes, no, no calls on are they? Cheers, okay Dave give it a good thirty second bet you've got a screwdriver over there ain't ya? Got to put this one back together while we're waiting Oh What you got after this then, d'ya know? Dunno mm That one of Selby's you know it was fine until they put an extension in just er a key station as soon as they did that this one started acting up, so he said it's only since we did that, he said it happened the day after we put that in, I said okay, disconnected it, still did it, disconnected it at the, end here, still did it, erased it from the program so it didn't even know it existed, still did it yeah, I, er wait for the light to come back up have you connected it? Yeah, even connected it on the end here, the, the station and set this display decoder up and it even did it there so it was nothing to do with the live lamp wire, the way they routed it we thought that perhaps rerouted it to the cable or something like that Yeah nothing went round and unplugged every phone out, wedged every one out cos we thought it might of been a station that's going down, cos er I'm saying about the mark one, the old two sixty, if you've got a bad phone it used to drag the paging down for all others, where if you've got paint in the socket Yeah or a bit of mould in one of the sockets it used to click all the phones when anybody made a call and er, all, all sorts of things that, I would of thought ah there's a faulty phone somewhere and it's degenerating and er we went round and waste every single one out, every single one, went to this extension pressed line three, play it down and the phone rang, I thought right it's not a phone, I changed the cabinet, I changed all the cards and the cards in one big one, I had one three so it weren't interacting between the two, everything had changed and it still did it, were a new kit, got a cabinet of setting line, changed it and it still did it. Well it st I mean it's something stupid innit? Because the simple reason I even went in at seven in the morning when they've got no compressors going in case it was the compressors dragging the whatsit down because to me it's, it's something like that everything, it's gotta be the C P U innit? It's gotta be something telling that bell to ring That's right and you would think if you change every bloody thing out That's right whenever it was telling it to ring That's right to stop Yeah, well I got a kit there and I wir I wired, just put it on the floor and it light on the wall, had it all connected bang, bang, pull them erm, er wired them all up and still did it, that mine? Or yours? Yours Is it? Yours Yours Call one please ring Brian before ten thirty, it's ten twenty nine now so, oh bloody car phone It's like Selby must be decoder number right round here No find it next to the unit, next to the That's what I like you co , you depend on someone helping me out and Don't out on you Well I, I wonder if it does occur again, happen again Yeah do decode it it's hell of a run you know innit? I did that at Selby's, I had the decoder, the new cabinet, everything, I had the decoder there hanging on the floor like that, I wired it up and I pressed extension sixteen and away it went, it said four there and the display decoder was there about ten extensions And it was about ten, sixteen that was doing it I think it was sixteen yeah, fifteen or sixteen, I'm sure it was sixteen Aye you said, like you say it could be se but third lines that is something that'd happened all of a sudden, of about four throughout the cou , well three at the time throughout the country have suddenly gone like it within about a month or so of each other , and they've never had any trouble before, but I was talking to Brian and he said that's a load of cobblers, he says it's been doing it for a long time and there's loads of them doing it. Unless we and see what's been used Yeah well if, if I get called backed to it, or I'll change that display decoder first, I mean that's been reset now, forget that, er Aye yeah, well if you can get out o, f of that though You can Can you, what on eight three one? Oh dear I mean I figured it's gotta be something date, dated I feel Oh aye, yes cause it to do it Well I thought that, but er you know, that was my to do it, but then again that was in it all the time, you know, it just don't make sense funny how they're both garages weren't it?

Yeah Well we can get an extension lead, mind you it's alright you it's not the same is it? You may find that's a moulded plug and it, no that end trigger, is it a variable speed trigger? No Oh I was gonna say I bought a variable speed trigger for mine cos its back up it erm But sometimes when you're using it it don't quite work Yeah, mine, like that Ha, see what he means it's a switch Is it? told him it might need a new switch Yeah, well that's why a switch, a switch on mine, so oh no the cable didn't come I says to him be prepared for a bill said I don't mind paying for one, but My last one was eight pound summat but mine's a variable speed reversible and all that About four quid there's no slow start on the reverse I got it while I was working in Leicestershire so I couldn't really take it back it'll cost me more in petrol mm what, I didn't, did you call special on Sunday? Why? Well Les says er when we got out the car and you went he says bloody hell that uses some juice don't it? I said well he reckons it does, he says when he filled up at the garage it were full, he says we hadn't got back and it was between the half and three quarters, I said oh I never looked at it Yeah Is it really that thirsty? Does about twenty, twenty three to the gallon What on a motor like that, no surely not must Right do more at the speed I was doing it keeps it to that, if I'd of kept it to fifty it would of been a lot more You what, well come on we were only doing fifty on the way back Yeah, weren't on the way there though I know seventy minimum on the way there Do you think it's worth it though for what you get out of it, well I mean you obviously do, you like the car don't you? I like it, er pulls the looks, it don't pull the birds but it yeah, yeah, soon I'll call you logo he went running yeah what is it? A bit of a funnel saucepan? oh you're deep frying them are you? Deep frying is a lot actually is a lot better than shallow frying Mm cos it seals the food as soon as you put it in Does it? Yeah So you don't get so much fat in it, yeah I'll have to get a deep fat frying pan then, for all the fat Oh it's true for all the fried foods I'm not no that's what I mean yeah, I've, I mean I ain't got for all the u fatty foods I eat I fry pasta, deep fat one, deep pan, oh I don't know, you know what I mean yeah switch that's gone, it's proving it cos it's a bastard Well you, if it's intermittent an'all put This the toggle fish on to use for a week if it cures the no I'll get a longer lead as well for it Mm about five metres of wire, is that long enough? What powers the drill? is it? Oh I, I had one of them oh would blow off wouldn't it? What is it? yeah, it's says low on it oh number, three thousand and under, one point eight amp, four hundred watts Yeah expect it to be that thick then Yeah,thing is getting them wires out Oh screws from under the side Fuck off What, what you on about? Oh brilliant Don't you know how to do them? Mine, mine was mine was erm if you've got screw contacts on it, mine have well to say that these er these switches are so unreliable you'd expect it to be erm these be a bit user friendly, cor blimey, just cut it about all things down and put a chocolate strip in, plenty of room in the handle Oh really You really want that one off though don't ya? Did he say he wants a as well? Yeah It's a bit of a pain int it? Seven or eight years Oh I tried it for her That's alright then er, I'll put a new switch on and wire, it ain't the wire at all it's the switch Mm have to double that, cos when you wiggle the wires here what it is when you wiggling the wire you're moving the thing contact, I said if you wiggle the wire it's alright it's sort of coincidental Mm it might actually just be breaking the wire there Maybe, just remake it I can't get them out, you can see it's struggling Usually is the wire Not on them it isn't, it's usually the switch Eh? It's usually the switch What on these? Yeah I dunno I think my jig saw went, that was the wire, I just cut it off and made it off again and it was alright it's short enough so it don't go through the window when you throw it Break the window to get the bloody wires through it's what? Where to get the ideas for the lamps and that Just what it is, it's these modern new they're not that bloody brilliant Mm, I can still remember Ann's face now, oh this bloody thing, got it and threw it, no, no Yes it just stopped short of the window, well no it was quite short you know, you could just see it aiming for the window, luckily it was plugged in It stopped it dead it stopped it dead in its track, yeah, couldn't get to rewire it after it though it snapped it a little bit. Yeah, just rewire it up, just try it for er, you know, I mean it failed straight away, if it don't fail within half an hour then your er you know what it is, save yourself getting a switch. Yeah, scrub the switch up that'll do for a change, paint it black inside the hose thing. cos if it's not the wiring, the switch is alright won't be able to what? Won't be able to get the why? a brand new blade, if working on something and working away not minding my own business Mm working away Yeah Oh did I laugh me just about done with these Oh and I thought there were a couple of speakers Oh, don't know where they're from no not really, not proper stand over here no I'm gonna turn the fan on, oh Jesus Christ mm and it always has the same thing Yeah must be want what they swallowed it and they're swimming round Oh shit Zoom, zoom, zoom What time is it?

I learnt something about it in the past yeah You know when you're fishing Yeah boil ham Yeah throw it down as ground bait Yeah sends the fish high Does it? Yeah oh I've heard of them, yeah, but I know this Pre-boil it Yeah rinse the stuff out, and just throw it in and you're away Oh I wonder if you grind it up and smoke it in a pipe with tobacco, would it have the same effect? I don't know I bet it would eh? I used to use them when I was fishing Yeah didn't boil it though did you? Mm, mm can't remember, I di didn't go for long yeah, we was talking about them today actually as a mat as a as a coincidence we er, we own that creepy crawlies and dragonflies Oh it didn't look like it was making a hundred miles an hour anyway No What happens if that engine blows up? Yeah, well it goes downstream then don't it? Goes back to the fisherman and they just er done the dirty on Yeah got one job all day today, oh yeah Got a good day then? Good day, yeah well I was in Beeston all morning preparing it, there's a programme on well I used er technical supports, workshop, went in there grab my and dashed out and fitted it, complete waste of bloody time mind you cos er we've got the own software back in now, well actually the latest releases of it, we were going back a release because er we were having trouble, but it turns out it's not our problem external problem so, put three dot seven back in. I can see it, blimey where's that from? Did it? What for? What really? Yeah You could use that couldn't you? You, you, you have two don't you for a sub base or just, you just have one do ya? One yeah Cos it's not, it's non-directional ain't it base? What, what it is on that one you've got this speaker right and it goes down to really low frequencies especially right, oh you've got to have a special sub base speaker then? Well it ain't gotta, it ain't got to be a sub base one, it's a base speaker Mm, bigger then You know , you know that padding that you put on the car you know that stuff on the doors inside? Mm, yeah You put two squares of that and stick on to the cone You're joking and it slows you down, and it goes in out and like that Blimey well you could have them on your A speakers and then have yours, just play your surrounds couldn't ya if you wanted to do it that way if you want really Yeah but you'll lose, you'll lose oh of course you are yeah, yeah oh just like that and hi-fi speakers and hi squire, hi-fi speakers Hi squire be hi squire speakers Anyway something beginning with S Yeah, all sorts like that Yeah and there's one it's supposed to be erm a pretty good unit Yeah and it only had one over all the speaker Oval? Electrical? Was it? Yeah on a four amp speaker that's it well we're not talking again, sub base No, no these are speakers on Really, new ones? Well not new ones out all sort of catalogue in them Mm computer, yeah yeah I thought about, about that amp you know Did you get it? Oh, eh Have you tried it out? Oh yeah Do you make a hundred and fifty watt speaker? Ha, was it? Sixteen hundred Well the ones I'm running are twenty five watts What's the, what's forty, twenty five watts or less, forty watts nominal the ones I'm running not through a hundred watt channel, er Now we went, we went to er to No it's just after the just before Christmas Right, okay then Angela, about six o'clock then Ain't you got the ones? Yeah Okay then Yeah see ya, ta-ta he says he says yeah about a hundred and forty quid the pair The pair? The pair Yeah and they erm say a hundred and forty watt Handling yeah there's, yeah, yeah that's not bad then, you said they sounded alright didn't you? Sounds did they? And when he sat in here like they've got like two glass doors Yeah yeah He's got two of them that go in to his next room Yeah and then he got it up the back that far You can hear it and he got it turned up a bit and sounds bloody from the other room Yeah and then we get in the doors well you know what I've done with mine erm, just temporarily, I'm trying to find out to speaker position, eh? Put big resisters on it Big resisters yeah, I just don't turn it up very far, it's, it's, it's lovely, it really is, it's well worth the money Yeah and er I've put er, you know how my room's, the fire's there and I, I had erm sort of either side of the fireplace didn't I, but one Yes was in the back room cos of the size of the fireplace and one in that corner but they're in the way, that was only temporary while the house is upside down and I've put two yeah, yeah, put them upside down and the house will be the right way round, I've put one either side of the patio door and sort of based them slightly inwards on the floor to get the maximum bass response, I understand in that room it's brilliant, it's absolutely su boom, boom Yeah but what happens when you come down the other end? As soon as you walk through the archway, I mean you'd expect it to be an open You'll lose it You lose it Yeah Well you'd lose it Could you get, you know when I said it, you know when I said about It must hit the wall and bounce off did I, did I ask you about that erm when Dave lighting on the ceiling, he's got four speakers and I said look what, what's happening is the, the sound from that particular sound from that mm It does work that does cos I've, I've read about it in one of the books Oh yeah, it's like wiring your speakers back to front as well Mm erm, getting the wrong, your, your, your bass response just goes it cancels out cos one's pushing and pulling, the other's pulling and pushing, vicious Yeah, I've got a design for a set of speakers upstairs and do, I think it's three way like that Yeah and it's, it's got the box the design of the box will interfere yeah I tell you what there's been about four or five different types of that is there? Yeah, you've got one where you get bass reflex Yeah right and then you've got an infinite backing where you got speakers there like that and then you got a board behind that and then one behind that and behind that That's right yeah, yeah you know, there's another one, another, another type of back is This is all for bass is it? No it's all for speaker's cabinets Mm, mm it's easily when the computer program is it and all the generator the sills mm an amplifier, a multimeter Yeah you know, and you stick it on, you know, like it shows in the circuit, and then whatever reading you get that's yeah whatever that is, I dunno yeah work out and you can put all the information in to the computer Yeah bloody hell, yeah, my box in, I think my speaker boxes are glued together, you can't get at erm Are they vacuum sealed though? It wouldn't surprise me Because it, it, it turns to the, you don't lose so much bass in the back Yeah, if it's vacuum sealed yeah Yeah cos in, well I don't suppose it could be vacuum sealed it would rip all your wouldn't it? Yeah I suppose it would wouldn't it, if it tries to come forward yeah, yeah But you don't get any as your bass come out your yeah, yeah, you don't get the sort of, when your speaker's on loud you get a lot of sound coming out the back Yeah, but it's very, it's well, can, I don't suppose it can be, I might of had one of the speakers out but I know there in the back of the speakers, you had this loft insulation it's full of that Yeah it's like white stuff No it's yellow, it's yellow Wadding Yeah like wadding yeah yeah there's a lot of different designs you can't move the back of these Can't ya? you've got to take the speakers out the front Mm to get, you know, to get inside I can't get in my back or front Oh can't you get your speakers out? I can't remember now, I know I've had a go to have a look at them to see how, to see exactly how, cos what I thought, what I thought I was gonna do was, I didn't like the furniture of the, of the speakers and when I was keeping that system I was gonna remount the speakers in the box a bit more you know decorative but erm, you know, I remember as coming across one or two obstacles and I couldn't get in to it I thought if I'd tried a bit harder, I didn't want to start you know so I've been thinking about convert these speakers this time Mm because you only sort of need to buy one set of speakers Mm move the cabinets and if they're no good just cut them up and throw them away Yeah you know, but, one of them it shows you inside the side view of the cabinet Yeah right, and you've got your speaker there, and you've got your coming down like that, but in the corner you've got a piece of concrete Concrete? and ceramic tiles set on it You're joking Eh? All in the, all in the book Oh ceramic tiles set in it like that Yeah Well that's the sound lock Oh yeah, but perspex in the speakers so you can see through them But the of perspex is not the right material for the, for the box is it? Not really because mm, wouldn't sound right though, you wouldn't get the cor correct type of resonance out of it mm, I don't know I think a lot of the sound travels through the wood, I think that's all part of it, you know, I don't think you'd have very good erm quality out of to be honest with you You know them, you know them little tubes that you put in mm, I've seen them on the front that's all yeah, mm things like that, they've a plastic tube in them, I is it? Yeah really but it's the right size This is it you see, I mean a, a company like or have gone to a lot of trouble to get that length right, er and to tune the box and all this that and the other and get the right, I don't know maybe er just think oh you know you just build this, put this massive speaker in and call it a sub based woofer Mm you know, you don't know what the qualities gonna be like, it's alright getting one for fifty quid Yeah if it's decent, but if you've got a decent system and you've got a crap you're really wasting your time having one Yeah I know Yeah cos I've seen a sub based they're over three hundred pounds and there must be a difference is it? Yeah Well, rather pay a bit more and get one that's good Yeah, I mean that Kenwood's got, he he says it looks nice as well yeah You can't actually see the speakers Mm he's got Kenwood words written on it and a great big diamond on the, at the end Mm, yeah,ma maybe with a W Yeah with a W That's right yeah that it's made out, yeah does it? Yeah Yeah and that's, that's what two hundred quid? That's two hundred quid Yeah, but I tell you what about then I says to him I went to him and says erm about the stamp thirty one hundred, he says erm Well I wouldn't do it, I'm not stupid enough Oh he says I can get you one, I said I want to hear it first Oh aye he said oh it's not rigged up, there's no plug on it, there's no speakers attached to the back, I says well when can you get rigged up? He says I'm coming New Year's Day, alright, he went down and he shut it, cos I went in the shop and I says er hang on I thought you was open New Year's Day?

It gives you the fastest route Shortest by road Shortest route Yeah and an intermediate route Yeah or in some cases you get two intermediate routes Mm and it tells you how far away it is, how long it should take you to get there to get there, yeah, you can put the time of day in as well can't ya? You can tell it what time you wanna set out Yeah you can also tell it what you I think it also works out the, the traffic load Yeah you can also, you can also Amazing work out if you want to avoid a place, you can put, say, say you're going from Mm or you can go by say from here here to Corby or something like that Mm where you go, you go through Leicester more or less wouldn't you? Yeah And you can just put down Nottingham to Corby avoiding Leicester Yeah and it says break and you can put out all your stops going in Mm you know you stop for twenty minutes, put twenty minutes, and you, you just press return and it throws a map up, a map of part of England Mm where you are That's it goes like that and puts all the numbers in Mm and then you can zoom in on it closer Yeah that's it you can move the arrow around can't ya, the arrow moves Yes and you can move the arrow and the cursor, that's it an arrow and a mouse you just hit it and it expands that bit Yeah you can zoom into it, you can zoom out from it, then you can put more detail in it, put more little places in around it and you can That's it, yeah where, where you are and that I think Gordon's got one, we use one at work though, yeah it's, yeah yes it's very good and then you just print it out and what you do instead of, instead of in the map with a, with a drawing like that Mm you, you get to the text one as well? Yeah Where it tells you you're at Yeah that's it Nottingham and That's it you have to walk so and so for three miles Yeah that's it Yeah Often my that's it, yeah, yeah, you can give it to the driver then can't you? Yeah Mm I was just wondering how on earth your supposed to get to the M one heading towards er Bramford I mean no Cockbrave, everywhere you go from here is towards Cockbrave Is it? Yeah I like, I like that, I like the idea of it telling you how far it is Yeah Lovely Yeah you know it's if you put twenty minute break in then does it tell you which is the best cafe to stop at and how much egg and chips cost you? and what you can do is if you've got a yeah you can go and say er Nottingham, Grantham, Grantham to Lincoln, Lincoln to Newark and it'll tell you the, the route between each town Yeah like that you see, if you get to Lincoln you've done that one Yeah go down here, down here, down here you see it Mm, very good, yeah, I was spellbound when I first saw that, saw that about, I think the first time about three years ago how, how long did it take Mick to sort it out? Sorry? How long did it take Mick to sort a route out? Erm, it all depends, it looks erm On that one it sort of leaves a disk, it's got like a bar underneath Mm and as it's checking the list for the roads in the town That is I think that is it, it cuts down like that, then it goes off then it starts again, then it goes off and then goes that's it yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm vaguely recalling it now because it was six months ago since I saw Mick's but er, yeah that sounds about right Mm I can remember something about that eight hundred and forty eight miles Really? fourteen hours and something Good lord that's without a break Yeah, well he's, when he first says to me he says right he says er, this was when I first got an inkling that he was gonna check the mileage you know like for the future, and it says erm, where do you wanna go to? I says er when was it, he says where do you wanna go from? I says Scotland, he says where? To Nottingham, where do you wanna go by? I says Dublin he says I can't it's gotta be in Geordie then he says erm he says well where do you wanna go through? I says well Blackpool then, did all the routes you know, tell you all the routes that you can take for you know, and that took what fifteen seconds, twenty seconds or something to work that out, maybe there's not a lot to er alternatives Usually has a C C that's it er yeah but the thing is learners can't use motorways, er they want something to, wish to avoid motorways I think there might be yeah Yeah I ain't had a proper look I just put it on and said, work a few routes out you know where it Yeah where you're going, I mean I did Nottingham to Peterborough, how long did it take Nottingham to Peterborough? Hour fifteen under An hour and eleven Yeah one hour and eleven minutes it said on there that's from door to door Yeah will do, yeah It'll take me fifty minutes Did it? Yeah, but I mean I think this is sticking to us I tell you another option, tell you another option you've got in quite young and at ten years of age I went into a poor old orphanage where I stayed four years. I came out of the orphanage to go and live with my mother and I found myself one of the family of six living in one room, the house was a four roomed house plus a scullery. Each room was occupied by a separate family, there was one cold water tap for the whole of the four families and one outside toilet. Conditions such as those were quite common to many thousands of people and I think it was those conditions which helped to formulate and develop my political thinking. When I was eighteen I came in contact with the Catholic Crusade which was a rather left wing Christian Socialist Organization and I found that their attitude to problems contained the answers for which I had been searching for a good many years tell me when you want me to raise something. Yeah, I'd like you to tell me about erm, what the house was that you left before you came to Harlow and why you came to Harlow? Yes,if we skip all the intermediate years with, after the war I came back from the army to find we'd been bombed out and were living in requisition accommodation, after a time, the, we were moved into a new flat over some shops. My wife was working for Cossors the electronic company and they moved to Harlow and er, it, in order for her to retain her job, we had to move to Harlow as well. This proved very difficult because, between the time of the decision being taken to move Cossors to Harlow and the time that my wife, my wife's department actually went, the Development Corporation had changed their policy and would not have married women as tenants. This resulted in a great deal of correspondence between myself and the Development Corporation and at the end of it I told my wife the best thing to do was to hand her notice in as there was no chance of us ever getting a house in Harlow, fortunately her services were much more seriously in demand then we imagined and the company nominated us for one, a house which is allocated to one of their executives, the house that we're living in now and have lived in ever since nineteen sixty three. The vast difference between Stroud Green Road, Islington and Harlow. For one thing Harlow is the sort of town which I'd been agitating for both before and after the war whenever I was speaking on behalf of the Labour Party both at street corners and at public meetings on the type of life we vis envisaged for a normal person in the land. To leave Islington, to leave Stroud Green Road, to leave a flat which was over a shop overlooking a main shopping centre, overlooking a completely noisy main through road to come to Harlow was a difference between chalk and cheese. The accommodation differed in, in one respect and that, that was that in the flat we were on one floor, we had one bedroom, we moved into a house with two toilets separate bathroom and three bedrooms, which enabled us to spread our furniture around, enabled us to have visitors to receive members of the family. I think this is one of the essentials in Harlow and something that people should not forget, that is that, although there is a great deal of criticism possibly of the standard of building that went on over the years of the Development Corporation, compared with what most people came from, there was a very great elevation both in quality and in ideas. Perhaps today the general public take too much for granted, the, as a local Councillor I have to interview many people who come to me with housing problems, to be as patient as one can is essential as a politician, but after the complainant has gone, one is very conscious of the fact that their problem is so minute it is hardly worth mentioning. But nevertheless that's human nature and perhaps it's also a reason why life should not stand still, whatever progress we make both in housing and in quality of housing and the quality of life, once people are used to that, to that they expect more and this is what progress, what forward thinking is all about. Could you tell me about the house, of which you were bombed out? Was it, were you married at the time? Yes I think that over the course of our married life we had a number of moves for various reasons, generally to improve the accommodation, erm as standard of life increased so the desire to have a better house to live in or rather in those days a house was out of the question, we generally had rooms in a house, erm, they, the flat for instance that we were bombed out from was a basement flat, erm according to the estate agents it was a garden flat, erm and it meant that you had access to the front garden and the back garden, but as for being a garden flat it was below the level of the garden in the front and at the back it was on the level with the erm green grass at the back of the house, it was also along side of the trolley bus depot, so there it was considerably noisy, nevertheless it was a self contained flat, the first one we'd had, no the second one we'd had and we were perfectly happy there although of course it did have minor difficulties, the fact that you used the front door with people who had flats on the other remaining three floors, but nevertheless it did involve you in a certain amount of community living, you were aware of your neighbours, you had to be very conscious of them and they were very conscious of you. That I think perhaps is one of the striking differences between that and living in a house in Harlow, where you may or may not know your immediate neighbours. Perhaps you know them over the garden wall to speak to you, you might even know their children by name and you know their christian name, but beyond that I think it's true to say, even making allowance of generation gaps that you don't know your neighbours in the same way that you knew your neighbours in London. Whereabouts was the basement flat, was it in Islington No , that was in Islington but it was in the district called Holloway Oh yes I know it well Mm Penventon Gardens Penventon Gardens, is the hou oh of course it's not there It's not there, mm, yeah if it was bombed out yes You were in the army weren't you? Oh I was yes, I was Army I was enjoying life in the army while my wife was enjoying the bombing. She was actually in the house when the bomb dropped on the other side of the road and she was flung down two flights of stairs and the piano on the other side of the room here bears the scars of the bombing. And that curtain went from the window right across the room and pinned itself into the piano, pinned the curtains into the piano. And it also managed to chip some of the woodwork, curious to think that I was offered as war damage compensation five pounds to re-case the piano, you couldn't of had it repolished for five pounds, but thinking was working class people shouldn't have pianos, I'm certain that was at the back of, of the gentleman whose job it was to evaluate war damage, he certainly raised his eyebrows every time we told him, what either a piece of furniture or crockery or cutlery which had been destroyed had cost and he was so foolish after er the house had been almost flattened as de demand bills as proof of evidence that your figures were correct Mm, so when you left your, when you came back you said that you went into a requisition property Yes, erm, we found ourselves in, rather to go back. After the bombing my wife was housed with an with another family Who had been bombed in the top flat, they, they were rehoused in a flat in a block of mansion flats and when I came out of the army this was the accommodation I found available, er for me and I objected strongly and after a great deal of fuss erm the Islington Borough Council's Housing Department found us rooms on the first floor in a Victoria Victorian villa in Penventon Gardens, which erm, were comfortable Not Penventon Gardens Er not erm was that Sunnyside Road Sunnyside Road Sunnyside Road Sunnyside Road, and erm, it were it was good accommodation we had our own bathroom and toilet er but again accommodation was cramped, we had no spare room And we weren't proud, there was people came and er the people in the flat above us had to pass our door to get to them in the same way that we had to pass the people, tenants below doors to get to their accommodation. Erm from there we went into this purpose built flat above a grocers shop, it was meant for the manager of the grocers shop, but he had better sense and so the flat became available for letting to the Borough Council who at the insistence of the owners of the house we were in, erm, were anxious to get their property back and so we found ourselves in a brand new flat, the first tenants, although this was not very highly to be recommended, you approached your flat up er stone staircase, er from the outside so you exposed to the elements er you then walked across the roof, flat roof over the shops until you came to your flat door, erm, Islington at that time was just beginning the, to see the influx of immigrants from the colonies as they were in those days and er, they in turn created much heavier demand on what little vacant property there was, so that the district rapidly deteriorated and for many people who were not in the fortunate position that we were found it necessary or desirable to leave because they were sharing rooms or sharing houses with people whose ways of life were different from theirs and this is something I think that housing authorities learnt to appreciate over the years that the differences between people's ways of life are one of the major causes of social distress. What year was that when you moved into erm Sunnyside Road? We moved into Sunnyside Road in nineteen forty five and we moved into erm Stroud Green Road Fifty three somewhere about nineteen fifty three, yes in our town house and we left Sunnyside Road in sixty three to come to Harlow. So you've only been in Harlow since nineteen sixty three? Twenty years yes Yes it'll be twenty years next March Mhm. Could you explain to me a little bit more when you said that erm a married woman couldn't be a tenant. Yes, erm, when Harlow was designed, it was appreciated that its, the, its purpose was to house workers in the factories and the offices and also to act as an overspill from London, and in nineteen sixty when Cossors were bringing their workers by the hundreds Fifty eight Fifty eight was it? When, in nineteen fifty eight when Co Cossors were bringing, started bringing their workers here the Development Corporation were very anxious to let houses and, so that it, it didn't matter whether the worker was male or female, he or she was accepted as a tenant, by the time we came to move in Harlow in nineteen sixty three the Development Corporation reneged on its promise to house my wife. At that time erm, I was a commercial traveller and Harlow was part of my district and they reluctantly accepted the fact that because I was a commercial traveller working in Harlow that I actually did work in Harlow which was stretching a point, but I really think that the Development Corporation's officials were getting a little tired of my being able to talk their own language and to write letters in the same vein as they could write, they weren't used to this, and, at any rate, as I said earlier we got here. We were offered some awful things though, in the first place Erm, I've always been interested in housing and it did appear to me that however delightful Harlow may be, when the architects were designing properties, they designed a property without any consideration for the people who were to live in them. We were offered a flat, which would of mea if we'd of accepted it would of meant we would have to of sold every stick of furniture because the rooms were not large enough Can you tell me the name of the block of flats or the address of it? That was er a flat in Plumtree, we were offered a flat on the first floor and when we examined the kitchen it was extremely obvious to me that our gas cooker wouldn't fit in the, the place where it was designed to fit, when I asked where do we put the washing machine I was informed that most tenants kept the washing machine on the balcony, when I said well where do we put the refrigerator, well most people keep the refrigerator either in the hall or, or rather not a hall it was a passageway, in the passageway or in the living room, now it does seem to me with hindsight that if that's planning I, to use an old fashion London phrase, I'm a Dutchman. Was the living room a com a com combined sitting and dining room? Combined everything except bedroom, there was one separate bedroom Only one bedroom? Yes erm, it was very obvious from the word go that they didn't want us. It was for a single person really wasn't it there? Well I would of thought so, although today it must be admitted that single people, don't get offered one bedroom flats, but then in those days there wasn't the shortage of accommodation that there is today Next question Erm, could you tell me erm something about how you felt about the change of coming to this house, you know whether you enjoyed it? Well I suppose at the, one of the best things, best examples of the difference was that my wife when she saw this house, knew that it was a house in which she could be happy, in which her tastes and, could spread themselves, erm rather than her tastes having to be curtailed by lack of space and lack of accommodation, erm, the fact that I had a garage which was essential er next to my house instead of some er quarter or twenty minutes' walk away from where I lived as happened in London also made a terrific difference to comfort, erm the fact that there was a garden instead of a few windowboxes and a couple of tubs, all these things I think made one appreciate the fact that you'd come, not only into a new town, but into a new way of life probably the fact that we had a staircase inside the house, which was the first time that we'd had a staircase between our bedrooms and our living rooms Mm so in all purp in, in always, the fact that you'd come into this house made one realize that there'd been a distinct change in one's circumstances. And did you feel that it affected your lifestyle? That you could do, you mention that you could now entertain Erm your friends well we always had entertained friends but we'd never been in a position to put them up so that erm most of our friendly visits were from people who didn't live very far from us, it meant that families, nieces, nephews etcetera were difficult to accommodate because they had to sleep on a couch or a settee in the living room with all its diff difficulties, especially when it meant in the morning for breakfast you had to get them up and dressed before you could start thinking about breakfast, and I think that those sort of things are things that er people ought to take into consideration when thinking about new housing. One of the beefs I have about accommodation for elderly people is the fact that by, that the purpose built, very excellent, bungalows and flats for elderly citizens are restricted to one bedroom which, to which but is by government decree to keep the cost down, but it does seem to me to be very heartless because elderly people's children are unable to come and stay with them except to the great deal of discomfort and perhaps as society grows a little more considerate for the fact that the percentage of elderly people will get even greater as the years go on, then they should make allowance and provide them for the facilities to enable them to be visited by their children and grandchildren. Did you erm leave family behind when you came away from London? No we never had a family so we were entirely foot free and foot loose. But apart from children I meant sisters or brothers Oh yes or parents or yes, erm my wife came from the Midlands, from Coventry and her family roots were in Coventry at the Midlands, in fact there she still has numerous nieces and nephews and great nephews and great nieces there to this day, my with the exception of a sister who moved, who, to Basildon, erm I have two brothers and er they still live in London, still live in East Ham, er the distance is not too great erm and, but obviously as we get older the amount of visiting we do will be constricted by the difficulties of getting from Harlow to East Ham especially when one is compelled to stop driving a motor car Did you bring furniture with you when like when you moved into Harlow? Oh yes, yes, we, the we had an extremely large rooms, I don't know went, what, what, what went wrong the architect but we had two enormous rooms which could of been quite easily divided into three, but we could of had two bedrooms instead of one and the conse Er, sorry to interrupt you are you speaking about this house? No, the flat The flat, right the flat in, in London, the flat we came from and so we had accumulated a little more furniture than one would usually have in two rooms and the kitchen and we got here and were allowed to spread ourselves, if there's one criticism that one could say about this house, is that the size of the rooms confines you to what you put in them, they're square, that the, the division between the living room and the dining room is through a pair of glass doors, where perhaps that could of been arranged with either sliding doors or some other feature so as not to separate it yet again into two square boxes and erm Are you in favour of open plan? er, it depends on one's own tastes, I personally don't like the open planned that I've seen in very modern houses where, erm I, I don't quite know how to express it but it does seem to me odd to be on one floor level and then two feet up you're on another level and er, that's one aspect of the open plan that doesn't appeal to me and I don't quite understand why it's necessary to have everything that's going on in one room with pieces of furniture designed to act as barriers between the different functions or purposes for which you give parts of the room. So how do you how do you see the ideal way of arranging a room? The ideal way, way of arranging a room as I see it would be that you could have your separate rooms but have sliding doors, after all there's nothing new in sliding doors, er, but doors opening and closing erm are restrictive, that's only my own personal view, my wife doesn't necessarily, necessarily share that view ideally if I was planning a house, the main room the main living room would be much larger than the one we live in, it would certainly be a different shape, erm when we had our golden wedding erm our visitors were so numerous that they were standing shoulder to shoulder in these two rooms and the kitchen whereas if it had been a reasonably designed house maybe we could of spread them around a little more, but they're minor, minor defects that are not really serious. I think today that if someone was designing a house one would incorporate all the modern additions which have suddenly become fashionable such as double porches, doubleglazing and er patio windows, I think that these things are perhaps a development from, in the same way as this house is a development from the rooms and the flats we lived in in London so that the modern conceptions of the things I've mentioned could be incorporated as normal in the house certainly would be cheaper to incorporate them when building the house than adding them on. When was this house built? Well I don't know the exact date but I believe this house is some thirty years old, so it was built about nineteen fifty three, fifty two, fifty three Does it have central heating? Does it have central heating? No it has central heating now, but it didn't when we moved in. Did you own the house? No Erm, did the Council put the central heating in? Council put the central heating in when we got advanced in years and when it became necessary in the doctor's opinion for me to have central heating because I had a heart complaint. So it's, the, the Council doesn't install central heating as a matter of course only if it's a special case? The Council has a policy now of bringing all its properties up to date, but priority because they're, bringing the houses up to date will take some eight years, priority is given to elderly citizens and people with medical needs. Do you like the orientation of the house? Do you feel that it's pointing the right way, bringing the sun in through the right windows at the right time of day? That's a little difficult to answer, if you're watching television, the sun can be a nuisance Yes of course when it comes in, pours in those, the house faces west er consequently although it's very pleasant in the afternoon and evenings when you're not watching television erm, it has its drawbacks on the other hand the garden is most unfortunately orientated alright? I think that's a minor problem but perhaps architects now pay a little more attention to and that is that, in the afternoon when you like to sit in the evening when you like to sit in the garden in the sunshine you are sitting in the shadow because the house er is between the sun and the garden I can't think of any more questions for the moment Alright So do you think I could ask you something about what you please tell No we're alright please tell me when you want me to go because Yeah if I over st don't let me over stay No, no, no, no. Er I liked to ask you erm about if you, if you think that Harlow lives up to the ideal of the New Town? It could be asked what is disappointing about Harlow, and I suppose that the first thing that strikes one is the design fault so far is the road work, the road network is concerned and er, and the inadequacy of the road, for roads for modern traffic. Very obviously when this town was designed and laid out and nobody foresaw the growth of the private motor car, er today private motor car is accepted, but in a town which was built perhaps the idea that one in twenty would own a motor car and we're now faced with the probably one in three have a motor car, we're now faced with a problem which can only detract from life in the town, also the fact that huge lorries are passing through what were envisaged as quiet residential neighbourhoods with a consequent breaking of curbs and of paving stones where the lorries are compelled to mount the pavings in order to get round parked cars and things of that nature it detracts from the life in Harlow I do, I think a considerable extent, erm, the other factor is that there's become a lack of pride in the town by the people who live in it, this is seen from the amount of rubbish, and refuse that is dropped from the minor vandalism that goes on the graffiti, er particularly in underpasses where people are walking to the town centre and that, those are the things where the town has lost its way, when we first came here you never saw bits of paper and packages from sweets and cigarettes and things, perhaps maybe because the package industry has developed over the years and that er whereas whenever we had responsibility for taking a small child out, if it had sweets it was encouraged to put the wrappings in its pocket until it got home, now of course it's encouraged to drop it just where it wants to and er this not only applies to children, some of the worst culprits are the adults who leave the, leave the public houses with a can of beer to drink on the way home and drop it just when they've finished the last drop of beer or the fish and chip paper's just dropped. I think this is detracting, I think it's inconsiderate, it certainly shows a lack of respect for one's neighbours or indeed for the town one lives in and yet very often I'm fully aware of the fact that the people who do the dropping are the first to complain that the Council doesn't keep the town clean. What, do you think that there's any connection between what you mentioned before about when you claimed for er bomb damage erm that working class people about being, supposed to have a piano, do you think there's a connection between that sort of idea and the idea of people that lived in Harlow in Council houses shouldn't have cars? No, I don't think that had a great deal to do with it, erm it was question that when the town was designed the, there hadn't been this sudden burst in living standards. If you compare when we first came to Harlow, which is only twenty years ago, the possession of a television set, erm was only just becoming the normal thing Mm the possession of the motor car was just becoming the norm, but the town had been designed fifteen years earlier And what do you think of the idea of ways that the, that the way the house types were graded, the fact that some of them were in fact meant to be executive or managerial classes and others were meant to be for people with less income, do you think that this is again recreating this sort of class system within the planning of the town? I think that what we've got is the acceptance by the designers and the planners of the class system that they knew Mm they had no vision of a classless society, erm, personally while I've no desire to see uniformity, I see no earthly reason why some people because they have a lower income should be compelled to live in inferior and perhaps crowded conditions, whereas the man with five or six or seven times their income can choose a larger house in a much more delightful district and I think it is things like that that make the difference between what I as a young socialist agitator was advocating and what we find today. I find too that circumstances compel a socialist Council like Harlow to be constrained and constricted when building, there are too many laws and regulations which are based on the fact that, for instance, today's government thinks that people who rent houses are second class citizens. Can you give an example when you say that the law is designed? Yes, erm, let us take one little factor, this question of the agitating the media and the, today, and that is the reduction in interest charges. Now when interest charges fall, the person who is buying the house benefits from the reduction in interest charges, but the person who is renting a house in local authority and then in this case nobody, nobody else in Harlow to rent it from, is faced with, not with a decreased monthly rental, but with an ever increasing one because as more and more Council houses are sold the cost of maintaining that there, the superstructure of the town, the cost of maintaining Council houses goes on increasing and so the burden is laid on the tenants and the tenant can find, will find himself that pound for pound increasing his rent while the house owner is decreasing his mortgage charges and at the end of the day the tenant is paying increased rent, increased rate and with nothing to show for it, erm, I've always been in favour of a sale, of, of property er owner occupiers, but not at the expense of the people who cannot afford to be owner occupiers, ah, to my mind, the present housing system is designed to maintain the existing class structure because even with the large discounts that one gets and nobody's ever yet convinced me that why you should get a discount because you buy a Council house, but if you buy one privately owned you can't get a discount and it, there's, this, this is so utter nonsense, but it is throwing a much heavier burden every time a house is sold on the remaining houses which are for rent, and so you that, although the idea is to make it a classless this society with more and more people owning their own properties the mo the mere fact that the majority of people in the town cannot afford to buy even the reduced priced Council house, is an example that the, the system, the class system a division by income still exists. Yeah may I ask Mrs some more questions? Would you mind answering some questions? Well she's a bit shy, but I'll help her. I wanted to ask you about the furniture. Can you hold it, if you just hold it about, like that, yes. Erm, do you mind answering some questions about your furniture? Oh, well, what do you want to know? Erm, you seem to like modern furniture Yes, yes Why did you choose modern furniture? Well Come in, come in, come in Jon. Morning. Good morning. Is it? Oh aye. I was laying a heavy carpet yesterday, and my Oh right. my chest's full of st It's er gunge. . Was it a s this time of the month already? Aye.. Good? I dunno er are you taking blood cos I've Doctor to see this afternoon. Er it's immaterial to me I mean I'm, I'm, I'm totally unprejudiced. I mean if maybe it'd be better if he does it Jon because he Oh I was Aye. I was thinki no I'm no being facetious. No no no no no no no It's just I'm just thinking. He'll, cos he'll see the results then, Aye. and there's less chance of them getting lost because if we send it over to Monkland and it comes back here, it goes to Doctor , you know how he's all over the place, and he's doing it all day, seeing clinic. as he's got Strathclyde, and he's got er Aye. Stonehouse as well. May be better if he does it this afternoon pal Well that's for, you know for, for the sake of getting the, the, the stuff all in the right place at the right Aye time. Aye aye. But urine test, absolutely fine, no problem there at all young Jon. That's smashing. Got a wee bit of reaction to the Sulfasalazine and the penicillin, mind. Oh right, aye. Er normally thirst. Right. I'm drinking water and and tea That's okay. That's alright. Anything. Coffee. Anything at all. But that's about the most I had. I started off at the s at the start I was er I was getting mouth ulcers, and then well I didn't get them to the severity that I got them with the sulfasalazine That's Er funny, cos sulfasala I've been s I've certainly been using it for years and years and years with different folk fo er for something completely different. Aha. I mean it didn't come for, come out for arthritis. Arthritis , no. It came out for something else. And I've used it oh, for about thirty odd years. I never found anybody with any trouble ever having any trouble with it. And yet when folk got it for their arthritis, okay? Yeah There's no trouble with er with the Sulfasalazine Aye. So there should be no problem. Yeah, that's right. Renal problems and er I was having bowel problems ulcers in my mouth. Mhm. That's right. And I was quite amazed. Eh? Oh aye. I was quite amazed. But er if you . said you know? Aye. But er I was away for a week there, I only came back on Saturday. Good, good Er did you get to? I was away up er Nunkton Kildray it's between Invergordon and Paine It's not my part of the world at all, It's beautiful don't know it , I don't know it , is it? Oh. Oh, right. Right aye. Oh So my w Jessie and I had a wee break. Peace and quiet? Aye,we we've been having a lot of trouble with the people next door, and er Mhm. it, it's really quite amazing. Oh . I can believe it. Erm trouble with neighbours is Well it's not unusual in . I hardly think that I'm able to run about banging doors at four o'clock in the morning. It's I'm up a I haven't seen you too often . I'm up against the six footer, and a five foot ten wife Aha. er and you know. having a that's what it's . That's right, that's right. Thanks . Okay. , Jon. Right. Bye. We need you in a semicircle and the best way to do that is to push your chairs roughly around that grey line There's a nice swivelly one Erm you pass those round in either direction, from now on it's, it's bandage time. Denise is going to do bandaging and I'm going to do bandaging and so are you, so you have these packs and these packs, if you'd like to take one pack each, I don't know if there's a pin in them, you might find a pin in there please look after them and bring them back each day, you'll find a bandage and a roll of bandage in there and so their your own properties In your text book you've got quite a lot of information in there about reinforcing, what we're going to do in the practical session and it's always a help I think when you have a lot of the, thrown at you to know that you can just put it up and there it is if you get a bit confusing or can't remember what's what, so on page one six nine it starts telling you all about nursing and bandages and general hygiene which we've already talked quite a lot about but it's very useful for you to know, you can go there and look, and if you just go through the pages from there on one seventy, one seven one, one seven two, one seven three and then on one seven four it's got the general rules for applying bandages apply bandages when the casualty is sitting or lying down, you always sit your casualty down and you work from the front of, I say why do you work from the front of the thing? So you can keep So you can see how they're looking, see if they're going pale a bit or if they're going to fall off their chair and talk and reassure them. That's right, erm always make sure that the injured parts are well supported bandages should be firm enough to do the job and large enough to cover the wound all of this is the sort of thing which you need to be referring back to if you're in any doubt. On page one seven five you've got how to check the circulation, after you've put the bandage on to make sure it's not too tight, it's not stopping all the blood supply, press a fingernail if there's only a finger nail and the, it should go white of course if you press it, then the blood should go back and it goes back pink again or an area of er skin, always check your circulation after you've put your bandage on. Now when you've actually opened your pack you'll find, what you got your triangular bandage here. Now I'm going to show you now how you going to put it away again, fold it, afterwards, opening it up alright, everyone open their bandage up? Now when it's opened it's useful as a sling, two sorts of slings we're going to do, high sling and the low sling but also if you fold it, it's very useful as a bandage too, if you put it across your knee, then you bring the point up towards you like that and then again, fold it the base up to the top again . and again face up to the top and there you've got a bandage, okay? One stage before that you've got a very broad bandage which is helpful for supporting things, we'll learn about how to use that later. When you've got it to the final fold there you've got your ordinary fold bandage and if you want, pack it away like that, you bring the end in the centre, there, so and again the ends in to the centre, just so that they meet like this, like this the centre, just so that they meet there, again, start like this, ends just to meet in the centre don't overlap them too much and again bend into the centre and you've got a nice little pad, if you ever need a pad for plonking on a wound quickly, there you've got a pad, or putting against an ear or anything you want it for and you open it up quickly and you've got a bandage, two of those and you've got a but it's a very handy way to keep. When you've got your bandage in your pack, I've explained to you before, you open it up in the first aid kit it's sterile, yeah, you open it up by the one hand goes one way, one hand goes the other, break it open, put the cardboard away and you need to be ready to try before you pull the next bit off don't you because as soon as you've opened that it's not sterilized any more, so you open that up and you find, unwrap it unwrap it as I showed you before with the first aid kit, comes out first and then you see how the padding because this wadding is stitched onto the back, and the front is the bit you put against the wound and you put it straight against the would without or touching it and that pad should be big enough to cover the wound, so you should something, overlaps, alright, and then if you find, if you unwrap the roll a little bit further, you don't want to unroll it completely, your see that if while you're using it in practice you need to roll it up again backwards towards the back of the bandage like so, we'll roll it up again, backwards and when you get to the bandage you just fold the bandage up around the long end and wind the short end round it firmly and there it's ready for use again in practice, you wouldn't of course do that for real would you? Put away, use another one. So that's how you look after your bandages and all these things that we're going to show you you'll find in those little sections in your first aid book so if you get confused or why you've only got to look up in the book. Let's do the sling first. I thought we'd do the sling first, high sling because it's very important to get it high and not pull it, everyone, anyone gets asked to do the high sling in their exam and if you can put a good high sling on you're halfway to passing Mm and from that it can't be bad can it? So I'll be the casualty and at the moment we won't worry about all the various things you use a high sling for, we just want to make sure that you can actually do it, okay? Can you just come back a little further and then they'll be able to see, better if all round the side Okay? Right, now then, be like this I'll pretend that I've done something that needs to be, a high sling to support me in this fashion. And I, I'm going to be working from behind Denise because you all need to see, but you would be working from the front as I've already talked about, so you need your triangular bandage, alright, and there's your long edge, and there's your point as we call it, a sort of elbow shaped, think of that as elbow shaped because it always goes towards the injured elbow. Now, that when you arrange your sling in the first place, it's crucial to the success and ease of which you finalize the bit round the elbow. You arrange it so that this long side is vertically up and down the body, right, in that direction. Don't let it come across like that, the temptation is to think that you've got to have all this bit up here, now you don't want this up here because it's very difficult to cope with once you've tied it round to get it round the elbow, you want the least amount that you can get, just cover the arm and then it makes it much easier to deal with at the end. The amount at the top that you need is just enough to tie a reef knot oh I've forgot to show you a reef knot didn't I? Tie a reef knot. We all use a reef knot in erm first aid and again it is in the book a very good illustration in the book reef knot and then nobody knows how to do it, I will show you in a bit, but that's enough to do a knot, the knot comes on just above the fingers, in the hollow of the neck, okay? So that's how you arrange it like that, the first thing you then do is to tuck the spare bit under the hand, cos the hand then there anchors it for you Okay? and the hand doesn't sneak out afterwards and starts popping out and then it's useless, then the rest of all this stuff you just get it out of the way under the arm, it's all gone, right, this bit comes up between the two shoulder blades, don't make the mistake of bringing it across there, a lot of people do that, that won't do, you have to come round the back and between these two shoulder blades to get maximum support, you've got to hold this elbow up and then you tie it near the hand, now I recommend that you tie it and talk to your casualty, half tie it and say is that supporting you enough? It feels okay thanks, yeah Cos then you can draw it up a little tighter if it's too loose, if it's like that and, most people do it too loose, is that tight enough? No it isn't. Right I'll just draw it up a little bit tighter, is that tighter for you? Better, better And now I'll do the other half of my reef knot, right, and tuck the ends in immediately, they don't like seeing ends because they're considered dangerous in first aid so don't forget to do it, do the knot, tuck it in all in one movement and then it's done, okay, how does that feel? That's fine Of course you're reassuring all the time as you do this Mm, mm Got a bit that's fall down Hello we haven't finished yet, haven't finished. Now you're gonna want a pin, these are rather small pins, I recommend that peop people who have got large hands try and fit their first aid kit out with large pins, they're much easier to handle, but firstly they do not put pins in their mouths for obvious reasons, either, either have it on the table open ready or just pop it in the front of shirt while you do this bit, okay? So you're going to fold this around the elbow to give support to the arm and in this one you're gonna fold first of all forward and then back, can you see that little neat envelope? A neat little envelope that's supporting quite firm, that's supporting the elbow, now pin it, again, now you can see how important it is not to have lots and lots of bandage up here, cos what will you do with it then? It's too much, if you ever have too much you can just fold a bit down, if you have a big bandage you can fold either of those edges down first if you've got too much and then you fold it forward and back, now your pin sticks in, but all the material and out of all the material and it goes in a straight upward direction, again it must go in that direction so that if per chance it comes undone it falls out and drops on the floor, whereas if it was sideways or downwards it would open and stick in your casualty, so that's why we have it done that way. Would you like to see that again or do you think you could manage it now? See it again See it again, right, I'll just do it this time without talking it through, and you can just watch Yeah and I tell you what we shall do we shall change arms We'll change arms as well you'll need to practise on both arms. And there's no use getting in the exam on Thursday and say ah well I'm afraid I've not done it on that arm so erm lost Okay, so there you are you see, you're, you're a first aider and you come up to the person and you hold it the way you did last time and you think ah, now that's the wrong way round of course, there's my elbow point, there's my injured elbow, so I have to be that way round, mm, so you turn it round the other way, right, your elbow shape goes to the injured elbow and your long line goes straight up and down the line of the body, you arrange it so that you only just covering the forearm there, with just enough above the hand to tie your reef knot that would be too little and that would be too much just enough above the hands to tie your reef knot, the first thing you do is to tuck nice, big bit of material right under the hand and anchor it into position, just keep that resting there and all the rest of this goes under the arm up between the shoulder blades there and you tie your first half of the reef knot just above the fingers in the hollow of the neck here, now that's important because round the back here if you press on that bit of muscle there, there's a big band of muscle, if you've got a knot on that it gives a great deal of discomfort very quickly so you want to get the knots round in the hollow here that doesn't hurt your casualty, there, draw it up half the knot, is that tight enough? It feels fine Yeah that feels fine and then do your other half of knot, reef knot and tuck it in straight away, you get your pin ready, have it on, either on the table or ready like that, now if you've got too much material ever you just fold that down, there, if that's too much, which isn't too much with Denise because it's the right size sling, sometimes you have to improvise and then you fold if forward and back, firmly, take the pin and put it, put your two fingers down between the casualty so that your fingers are apart and there's a space between your fingers so you can stick the pin in and out again without any danger, if you put the fingers apart like that, if you do stick the pin in yourself and draw blood would you please throw the pin away, as a matter of automatic hygiene, it mustn't be used again once it's been stuck into somebody Or in your casualty or in your casualty, it must be thrown away Do it up, discard it Alright get another one from the box would you please make sure that all through these practices that you deal with different people all the time cos in the exam and for real afterwards you'll have to bandage all different shape people and if you just get, work in pairs you don't get that sort of practice, by all means start of with somebody next door to you but each time you do one go across the room and find somebody you haven't done before. And if the gentleman having to put bandages on a lady and you want to put your hand underneath there just excuse me a moment, alright, because in the exam one row of you will certainly going to have a lady bandage okay, put slings on and to bandage so it's just as well not to get to you know used to bandaging up great big chaps and then you'll find you've got some little tiny five foot two or five foot nothing lady bandaging in exam, alright, so swap around, so get yourselves so you've got a partner and use your bandages and let's just see you do the high sling to start. All got safety pins by the way? Yeah they had them in the little packs, okay? Right How many people know how to do a reef knot for sure? No Right, so I'm not wasting my time a reef knot then? If, if you look in your books page one seven seven, you'll see a beautifully illustrated instruction on how to do it, which you can refer to yourself this evening or later on in the course if you forget but I'm now gonna show you how to do one as well, you, if you want to know it's there for you to look up you take the bandage and fold it into your narrow fold band and put it round your leg, you've got something to tie a reef knot round, okay?if you know how to do a reef knot already fine, just do it, if you don't, follow instructions. Narrow fold bandage you've done it correctly then. The doing it the same way each time and a reef knot is the opposite way each time, alright, undo it, once again, just once again to make sure you know are you ready? Once again, now it doesn't matter which way round you start, you can start left over right or right over left, but the second time you do it opposite to the first time, so the first time I put the left one over first and the right one over that and then tuck it through, just like tying a shoe lace really, okay? And the next, pick the ends up, I put the right one down first and the left one across it and then put that one through and then that's a reef knot no that's a granny over there anyone not sure? That, that's the one you have to remember which one you put on which, that was the left on top of the right, now the right on top of the left yes, come on which one did you do first? That's the right on top of the left okay, right on top of the left, now you've crossed over again left on top of the right, put that through there okay yeah All okay I think mm, yes all okay now, right. I bang my head, I cut my scalp, yeah, everybody, I bang my head, I cut my scalp, not massive bleeding none of the bandages we're doing this morning are to do with massive bleeding, they're all to do with what we call minor wounds, right so small cut, but it needs attention, okay, so I cut my scalp Cor okay so I've got my pad it's a bit tender alright, so I'm going to ask my casualty to hold my nice clean sterile pad that I've got folded ready over the wound, there, gently, okay? Yep Then I'm going to take another triangular bandage and I'm going to open it up and make just a little fold, this is going to go on her forehead and that little fold just helps with keeping it firm and stopping the bandage slip, now, just put it around the forehead like that, okay? Cross it over, round the back, and back up to the front again, do a reef knot here and tuck your ends in straight away of course like so and then this little bit can just be tucked up where you've crossed the two ends and make it look neater with no ends hanging out, no that, all that does is keep the dressing secure, keep infection out, okay? The difficult part about this one is that people all have odd shaped heads, now and you find that if you put them on too high they squidge off like that, and you've got to think of bandaging an egg basically, if you had an egg with a little hole in one end and you've got to put a bandage round you'd have to put it very carefully round the widest bit wouldn't you for it to stay firm and that's the secret, everyone's heads different and as you put it round you've got to see where you can get it, where, sometimes it's over the ears, sometimes it's above the ears according to the peoples' shaped, different shaped heads everyone's different, anything else? Okay, have a go at it and we'll come round and correct what you're doing as you're doing it, alright, so you want to pad over the wound to keep infection out and then try to get your bandage on top of that to keep the dressing in place. Right, well we want to make sure that you can get out to lunch sort of by, that's running a bit fast that clock, we'd like to get you out to lunch by about half past twelve otherwise you'll end up being late don't you with all the other people right Right, okay, what now, erm roller bandages so you can put those triangular ones away for a minute can't you Let's do the elbow and we'll do the elbow and knee okay elbow and knee then using the roller bandage And again here it is two pages further on in your book, if you forget how to do it, just look up, okay? Roller bandages Well I fell over, slipped over in the car park out there, all gravelly and gritty out there and I scraped my elbow and I've got a nasty graze all on the elbow and it's all full of grit and muck, help Come and sit down here my dear help let's give us a little now if we've got a tap handy probably the best thing would be to run it under the cold tap and that hopefully would take away any dirt and extra bits and pieces that are stuck around it. If there's anything embedded in it like gravel or something and it doesn't come away easily you mustn't, it comes under the categories of what you call foreign bodies, which first aider is not at liberty to poke about, you must leave foreign bodies that don't come away easily where they are and bandage them round and send them off to hospital or a doctor, but assuming it's just a little clean graze, if I haven't got a tap to put it under, then I must use little bits of gauze to wash, put in a bowl of water and just wipe, yeah, and you always wipe obviously from the centre of a wound towards the outside, otherwise if you start to wipe across the whole thing you take dirt from one side of the wound across and drop it off in the middle somewhere, so you wipe from the centre out and throw that piece away and you take another piece and wipe from the centre out and so on until you feel happy, quite happy. I mean, well if you haven't got gauze in your first aid box, but you could have something like a Mediwipe or you might be able to use, open up your bandage and you can use, you know, several pieces of this, just keep going down the bandage and then you know clean it and get rid of that bit, okay, another clean bit okay, so you can adapt with whatever you've got in your first aid box, yes, and you won't necessarily have scissors to hand so you'll have to do whatever you've got and the little Mediwipes are very useful for that, but don't use one Mediwipe for seventy five grazes, okay, one Mediwipe for one wipe and then discard, okay? Okay, so I'm going to open up my sterile dressing now So I actually put my arm out straight for you now? Do you think it'd be better if you had it bent cos it'll be easier for you after I've bandaged it It's better bent is it? Yes Okay, alright it would be better if you can manage alright to bend if it's not too uncomfortable needs practice doesn't it? Yeah. Of course, being in the choir it gives you practice reading music because you just have one line to follow Yeah. and that's a good start isn't it? Aha I have heard erm some choir, the choir sing a little bit cos erm we got a corridor near the music hall and erm they sing up pretty loud so you can hear it. Cos there's erm er machine in there what you can get erm fo food from right, so I go down there sometimes Yes. get something out the machine and listen to the music in there. Nice! Good! I think it's a good school don't you? Yeah, it's pretty good but erm the older ones think they run it a bit! Yes. But, there's, some of them are alright. I got some erm friends up there who are in fourth and fifth year Mm! so and they then erm I have got some friends I used to know as the little school but they've left now. Oh! Erm, they just went on to their fifth form Yes. so don't see them around much. Mm. Erm I know a boy erm Rickie who just lives up our road Mm. erm ho , I know him so I go and see him sometimes. That's good! Mhm. But I don't see him that much because he go and play sports on the Yes. field. Yes. And then they're just not available to play at home th those No. times. No, that's right. You always find wherever you are that the people who've been there a long time get sort of erm a bit uppity, they think that they're Yeah. the bosses of everything. But of course, one of these days you'll be at the top of the school won't Yes. you ! A lot of erm them, cos erm we're up, we're in the upper sort of thing, we're in the upstairs in a form room, so when we walk downstairs to erm down to a lesson they come barging up there and pushing out of the way! Yes. And that's the only trouble about it. That's not very nice when you're a bit smaller than they are. No. Aha. Erm they try and erm erm sort of push you out the way and tell you to get lost! Yes. Yes. But erm Well when you're big, that's the thing to remember and you won't push Yeah. the little ones around perhaps No. will you? I got to , when I was going to the little school I got told the little ones. Mm. But they erm I was used to it, used to it cos erm Mm. I got a lot of little cousins and that Oh of course, yes! So you know what it's like being small Yeah. too. And what about all this gardening then? I was very interested when you were talking about gardening this morning. Erm Well you don't do any gardening, I suppose at school? Erm, no, I wish we could have a garden, sort of thing, like we mi , where mum used to go and have a garden but it don't Mm mm. now. Mm. Erm But still, you don't need a a garden at school, you've got the, really the whole of that garden at home. Yeah, so Because your father can't do much now can he? Erm no, he does help me a few things but I do all the digging for him because he can't bend down too much. Yes. Erm I told him he ought to get erm, one of these rotovators and a plough underneath Ah ha ha ! but he said it's too much money cos they're Yes. Yes. a few thousand pound now. I suppose so! And really and truly you've got to have a very big piece of ground to need one of those haven't you? Yeah. I think you're a very good forker and spader really! Yeah, ah well erm when I was younger I used to watch dad so when he put his seeds out I used to erm get the erm erm erm, spade and sort of keep digging them up,se seeds up so I got, I got to know how to use them by then then then erm while I've got older dad got another piece of ground what he's given up now Mhm. erm he , we used to go up there. Where was that er Erm Ben? up our road and very first house, number one, he had a big bit of garden Oh I see. erm but after a few months dad gave it up cos it was erm too wet and that where weeds could grow easily Ah yes. and we keeps erm digging it up and weeds keep growing. Yes. We had potatoes in there for a time but we had to keep hoeing all the weeds out. No, and of course the weeds will have a Yeah, they a fine old time won't they? Yeah. Aha. But your ground, I imagine you've kept it fairly cre , free of weeds for quite a Yeah. time now? Erm on our some of our small plants we don't use any erm sprays or No. we use erm a rake or a and we draw across the seeds and that'll ra , bring out the weeds. Yes. I done that on my wheat this afternoon erm but we have to use fertiliser on ours cos Mm. we don't have to sort of, ain't gotta take really too much muck Mm. Yes. cos we do half, we muck erm I've grown pretty well Mm. so it gives the plants a boost Yes. so we don't have too much muck so, and like put some fertiliser on the other bits. I see. Because, in fact, you can't put that compost on the, or that muck on the, when you say muck, do you mean the compost that you make with the vegetables? Yeah. Yes. Erm, you can't put that on till it's really broken down can you? No. So it's erm you use up probably quite quickly what you've got. Yes, erm all our sort of cabbage stalks and beans stalks go onto the muck heap to turn into a sort of compost, but other people they just sort of burn or take them away and buy a bag of compost. Yes. But erm bought bags of compost aren't so good cos if you use all er, stuff you're growing you put erm it back onto the ground Mm. Mm. what's come off the ground. Mm, yes. Yes, it seems reasonable doesn't it, to put it all back? It's all been natural stuff hasn't it? Yes. Aha. Which bit of the gardening do you like best? Well erm the best bit, I like harvesting, I don't like the digging is alright but it hurt your back so Yes. You get yo wo once you've done a lot you suddenly Yeah. feel it don't you? But the hoeing is nice and easy Yeah, okay. more or less. Mm. We got erm various sorts of hoes. We got a Dutch hoe, that's Mm. pretty easy to use. Nice! And erm, we got another hoe oh er, I don't like using it cos it's got wood and it keeps giving me splinters! It's got, oh really, that's the handle is it, that does Yeah. that? Hiya Ben! Ho Hello. Hello. We've got a hoe that what is that hoe called, that we've got Noel? It's got these prongs that go like that. Oh, what's Erm that for? Oh yeah, I've got one of them. Have you got one of them? Because they get, the weeds out quite deeply don't they? Er, oh yes. Erm , I got two of them. Mm! I bought one erm I think it was a year or two back then our next door neighbour di , well no, it was before she died, she gave me one. Nice! Mhm. So I got quite a lot of old tools, really old ones Yes. dad's got loads of old ones, what he use Has he? I like them better than the modern ones. Do you? Yes th , there's something nice about the old tools isn't there? Yes, cos they We've got one hoe that's at least two hundred years old! Yes. Yeah , yeah. And we've, but only found the middle part Mm. and I had it sharpened by Hector Yes. and now it's as good as new! You can see it afterwards. Yes, where erm my next neighbour gave me some stuff erm, then I went into her shed cos she had erm, some mice problems so dad went in there to have a look round, seeing the poison were wore off and we found quite a lot of old gardening chu , tools. Ooh did you? Cos erm her husband was a farmer we found a lot of old really old ploughshares like Yes. that. Yes. I found an old plough wheel, I still got that at home. I like keep an antique stuff like that. Oh yes, it's interesting! Aha. Erm and, she had some erm chicken ho er,hoppers that erm she had Chicken hoppers? Yes, erm used to put, you put feed in them Oh yes. and they soon get erm but they had plastic ones and they have lights on them. Really? Yeah, but they smell! Oh, do they? Yeah, erm when we're up the farm when er, after a few days we put the feed in them they smell. Oh that's not nice is it? No, cos all the plastic sort of Yes, that's because they've got a light on them isn't it? Yeah. Yes some erm some light, electric light fittings are made of plastic and they like bad fish after Yeah. a time don't they? It's horrid! Yeah, erm when we went in there for a few times used to get headaches and that. Yes, nasty! Yeah, but the weather was cold, when cold that er, it took away some of the smell Mhm. but as they got muddier it worsened. Yes. I in the end it gets yuck! Yeah. Erm the really old sheds they're better than the new ones that Yes. Mm. erm they er, they're cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Mm. Mm. For that stuff. That's an advantage? Yeah. I've erm dad had a lot of old gardening to , tools up in er his shed when he was up but when we when dad retired he was going to erm take them, but he forgot about them Ah! and they left them up there. Oh dear! So, I don't know wha , we, he did get some but erm a lot of them he wished he'd brought Yes. and left the other ones. Oh dear! He brought the wrong ones he thought! Oh that's Yeah. hard-liners isn't it? Yeah. And where do you keep all this stuff? You haven't got a shed have you, in the back? We got two, one was an old erm air dru , no one of them erm, bomb shelter type things Oh yes, Anderson shelter! Yeah. Mm. And er we had a wooden shed it blew down in a gale so my Nana, she bought us a shed Oh! for a present. Oh that's nice! So we put that up. We keep some tools in it. We put our cat in there cos she like going in there and we have some ta , we put seed and that down there. Our other sh shed we put all the tools and Yes. To keep them out of the weather. You've just got to have somewhere to put them haven't you? Yes. Aha. Cos erm well if you leave them lying about they'll rust easily. Yes. Now that's quite true. Well you're quite an experienced gardener, it seems to me Ben! You must of learned a lot from your father by now? Yes, erm I get erm some mags, ah erm gardening magazines and I look at them. Oh yes, that's useful! Mhm. Erm , dad tells me a lot about it cos he started gardening when he was young. Yes. He got a lot taught a lot off granddad. Mhm. Erm, so it sort of originated in our family. That's right, a family thing, you hand it down from generation to generation Yes. don't you? And the books of , are useful because there are lots of new ideas have come up Yes. as you go along. Erm er mum gets some for me on Wednesdays sometimes, when she goes to Framlingham. There's various ones I read I had one from the library, it was a big one Mhm. erm I was reading about carrots, so I didn't get to finish it cos we only had two weeks. Erm little window box ones. Mhm. Er, what you grow in a window boxes. The little Mm mm. erm short ones, and they're sweet. Yes. Carrots? Yeah. Yes, some of them are nearly round Yeah. they're so small! Yes. Aren't they? Tha look, they look funny to me! And when I erm, first got them cos my granny got me some for a birthday present Aha. erm when we've dug them up I I didn't think they looked like carrots until we had No. them. That's right they, and they must be a bit fiddly to peel mustn't they? To scrape, rather. Yeah. Instead of a nice long scrape, you've got to go round corners haven't you? Yeah I keep, when I I I always scrape the vegetables sometimes but when I do though I keep cutting my fingers! Ugh, yes, yes! So I gave them to dad to do. Ha! What's the idea of those little carrots? I don't know. Er erm, there's only been last year that I've grown them Yes. so I don't know much about them yet. Did you like the taste of them? Yes they're, they're nice and sweet. Are they? Mm. Erm other carrots, erm they don't grow that well, I don't think so anyway. No. Well there's so many things that get into carrots aren't there? There's a wa , a wire worm or something? Yes erm And carrot fly. Is carrot fly the thing that goes for carrots or not? Erm, yes tha , that will come in really bad! Mm. Slugs, erm they'll Mm. go after carrots and potatoes. Mm. Erm one year we got no end of slugs! Erm leatherjackets, they're bad for them. Oh yes! Mm. Erm so when you sort of dig the ground up you have to chuck them out the way. Yes. Cos they'll, they'll work their way back in. I'm sure. Start eating the plants and that. The plants. Yes. Yes. That's why I say nature works against you instead of with you. Yeah. So I don't bother! Don't you put any lime on them? Erm well we have tried it once erm but we put soot on them because they'll so Yes, soot is supposed to be good for something. Yes. Erm, that will sa , that will stick to them and erm they will that will make them feel ill so they Yes. die. Yes. And erm, soot's good for the ground. I see. Dad used to put erm a lot on it but we had to have erm the chimney sweep at ours for quite a long time No. and he hadn't got any. You'll have to get some more soot. You'll have to get him along and you can have some more soot. Yes. I've forgotten what they used to use so soot especially. My father used it, but I've forgotten what it was. Never use it on vegetables, around vegetables to stop insects creeping too. Does it? It'll stop them from crawling across, They don't like it? just under the surface, they couldn't get . No. No. Aha. There are so many things you've got to be looking out for in those Yes, erm I read up quite a lot of things about keeping pests away, but I don't dad reads them and tells me about them, but I forget cos they have to go back That's right. after so often. Yes. Let's see what we've got there. Ben would like to go to Otley to do a proper training course. That's a very good idea Ben. Yes. Yes. And so you're going to work at the things that will get you in there aren't you? Yeah, so I will do quite a lot of erm, stuff erm I should say in geography, sort of work in geography for that things. Erm we done a little but we hadn't done that much yet, but my sister tells me as we go , as the year go on and do a bit more about it. Mm. You learn about soil formations and that sort Yeah. of thing. Yes. How old are Ben? Sorry? How old are you Ben? I'm twelve. Twelve. Mhm. Mm. He's a wonderful gardener for twelve, I can tell you! Good! Ha ha. Erm and And what else would help you to get into Otley? I suppose you've got to be able to do maths for most things haven't you? Yes, erm and when you go to Otley College they will teach you everything, so you need maths,or this erm Yes for measuring an an yes. Yes erm I'm not looking forward to doing the cos they've told me about it and he used to get headaches and Really? Well I think that you wear masks now don't you, when you use it? Erm, yes, erm if you haven't got a tractor you have to, but if you've got you don't have to so much. I see. But erm if I, when I go to a farm I don't want spray. No? Well it would, not very good for you would it really, because of your No. chest? Mm. Yes. Aha. Erm I don't mind fertiliser, that's okay. Mm. And but What we were talking about, or what I think is interesting is your experience from your early days in horse shoeing has stood you in good stead for the revival of interest in driving erm if you'd like to tell us a bit more about that I'd love to hear it cos I'm never tired of that. Yeah well er the shoeing today is completely different to what it was when I started nearly sixty year ago. In them days horses were they were all working hors , driving horses you hardly ever see a riding horse. Er the ones they did ride were the ones they used to drive at erm ah, down the two jars but er and that was a completely different way of life then to what that is now. Er Mm. er the horses that are shod today, you see they all riding horses, no very few working horses. Yes. Er but now the It's, and that's your hobby isn't it? Yeah. Yes. Er where before that was the horse was equivalent for a motor today. Yes. So that was a living. It did the Er job of a tractor, it did the job a van a lorry Lorry. a car, everything! Yeah. Yes. Ah , every form of transport Transport. when you think about it. Yes. Mhm. And is it But now different type of horse that makes it different for shodding Oh yes! today? Oh yeah! Not the question of the same horses doing a different job. No, that's a different type of horse er Yes. er, the old fashioned working horses er practically extinct. Yes. And the shires are still there fairly strong, still er some of course has now gone onto the rare breeds. Mm! Er registered you see. Er Welsh colts and things of that nature are coming back a bit now, they are building up now er but But would I be right in saying that the everyday working horse, the sort of, general purpose working horse that people used years ago, people such as carriers, they would use horses which were crossbreeds wouldn't they? Not Yeah. not a purebred anything. Not a pure , no! They'd be good old heavy, honest, rough Yeah. Yeah, yeah. hard working horses. That's right. Not things of beauty really at all. No. No, ooh no, no! And you hardly ever see that type now do you? Gypsies No. have them. You still They were see gypsies with that sort. built for strength Yes. for the Yeah. jobs. Yes. Work. Yes. Were they? Yeah. Purely for Yeah. work and hardiness. And they're ornaments today, they aren't working horses. That's right. You put these horses into hard work today they'd be dead within three months! Would they? Ooh yes! Yeah! Yes, the whole scene has altered. And er, as I say, observing this and watching Hector's work and how things have gone on over the years, er as you know, there's been a tremendous revival of interest in driving, so many people have er, restored carts or had new ones built and erm the young farriers who've never had the experience with driving horses, they have run into problems with erm, keeping them going soundly and overcoming problems which crop up when horses are driven on the road a lot. Yeah. Mm. Would you like to tell us a bit more about that? Well, yeah that is, I'm I mean that's a completely different er er laxing of the, it's completely different. Er when you're riding a horse, you see the weight is all on the back er whichever tendency do and what we call the gait er Yes. is the hind legs in the front Yes. they have a tendency to open them make them wider apart Oh yes! by the backs. G A I T. That's right, that kind of gait. By the back and swop them you see. Well er, with a driving horse that's completely opposite because yo your vehicle behind the horse is pushing against it Yes. and have a tendency to punt the back Really? so that pushes the legs fo closer together, do you see? Good heavens! They're more likely to And then they're more likely to hit, they're more likely to hit Mm. the front legs with the back legs Really! when they're going, especially going down hill. And of course, there's a word in the trade for that isn't there? Yeah. Forging. What is it? It's what, now there's a Forging? completely Yeah. different use for the word forging. Now, is it related to forging ahead in any way? Oh do , is that where forging ahead comes I from? When you're really pushing? Yeah, yeah, pushing. It might well be. It might Yes. well be. I would say the term And, and then they can forging ahead has come from the use of that word in relation to horses. Yes. Yes. I would say, because that Yeah, probably. dates back many, many years doesn't Yeah. it? Yeah. Yes. Because they That's it. do do it when they're pushing ahead Yeah. they, they hit the front foot with the hind one. Good Lord! Occasionally you Yeah. hear them do it Oh! when they're driving, it's quite a sharp Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. crack you Yeah. hear. It's amazing! Mm. Er so that's, that's completely different do you see? So the styling of shoeing is different. Mm. Completely different. If they do it too much then the farrier's not doing a good job Job. and his job Really? is to re-balance the shoe so that er, it just misses Miss. the front foot as it comes forward. If the Right. if the horse is travelling fast on the road he's at the trot, I mean it isn't Yes. the done thing for driving horses to canter or gallop on the road, they never ever should. No. Erm, but at the trot, when th the the legs are moving the diagonals are moving so of course the front and the hind foot come very close together Ah that's it! at one point in the gait Yeah. and if the Yes. shoe is slightly wrongly balanced, or the foot is slightly wrongly trimmed, then you get these troubles, you Yeah. also get what we call, brushing don't you? Brushing. When they Tell Edith about that. when they hit both legs together like the hind legs when they they'll hit each other they'll hit one hind leg They really, they with other one you see. They really Ooh! wear They give it a . a a a sore place Ooh yes! on the Yes. Like us banging our ankles like that. That's it. Yes. Yes. Yeah. They do it on what we call the coronet Yeah. which is of course the little junction between the skin and the hair. Yeah. Ooh! Very tender place. It's like the quick of our nail Ooh yes! where the I can imagine! tissue grows from. And they do And on the front damage their coronet. On the front one they do it on the knee which is the er do you see, which is higher up. Yes. Yeah. But the knee comes sort of out Out. doesn't it? Er inside Yeah. Yeah. there's a Yeah. nobble Yeah. Yes. on the, yes. Yeah, yeah. Yes. Yeah so, and that's what they call cutting. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Really? Yes. Yeah. Yes. You'd never dream! And so people who go and, usually into horses need to know all these or else they're going to be very unfair to the horse. Well er They should know about it! They should know it. Yes. They should know it. But er But it , mainly it's the farrier's job to know. Yes. But course, they don't er It's his responsibility. they don't do enough work to really create any problems today, do you see what they're to do somebody will say ooh we'll go out for a ride Yes. they're out, half an hour? Yes. Hey? We'll go out for a drive probably out an hour, whereas years ago the horse used to come out the stable at seven in the morning he wouldn't go back till probably five at night. Course! Probably later than that! Mhm. He'd go the driving horses, they'd probably go to Wickham market Monday do you see, the sale on the Monday they'd go to Ipswich on the Tuesday er Wednesday they'd go to Bury er and Ailsworth Yes. And they really earned their Then they'd go to Norwich. keep! Full time job! Ooh they worked hard! And then they'd go to Norwich on the Saturday. Mm. I mean they'd, they'd, they'd be doing probably anything up to forty mile a day weren't they? Would be. Yeah. Yes. And I mean, that was six days a week! Yes. But now they do er twenty minutes they think they'd have done wonders! Yes. Or go from pub to pubs You know. that's about it ! Yeah. And you think of these , for instance Prince Mm. Yeah. Phillip, who is Yeah. Yeah. presumably those horses don't do long spells of that sort No. of driving? No. No. They'll be exercised in other ways I imagine will they? Exercised, yeah, they're exercised, normal exercise during the week and then when they do these events do you see? But of course, if you go back far enough do you see on these four in hands were were going from town to town weren't they? I mean, they were they were mail originally weren't they? On the stage coaches, yes. Mhm. Stage coaches Mhm. Yes. Er on the horses that's understandable, they can start off and probably don't knock theirself but there's a time they'd done twenty or thirty mile pulling a load. They're tired, They're tired Mhm. er, and then they start and that's when the trouble starts. Just as we do, walking a bit less Yes. carefully. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes, the same Yeah. thing applies. Mm! Exactly! Mm! And What about er, in those days er, possibly a few still, when erm let's, you said gypsies didn't you? Mm. or let's say just erm odd tradesmen had a horse or a pony or whatever it was pulling a cart round the streets with vegetables or with, with er coal Yeah. or something what about the amount of care they would get from a farrier, those horses? Well they they got reasonable care because, like I said, that was, that was the the owner knew that er that was his livelihood then That's the thing I suppose, yes. and he treated his horse well I mean a lot of these horseman, good horseman treated the horse better than they did the wife! I wouldn't be surprised about that ! Ooh yes! Living in the East Yes. End, I wouldn't be surprised Mm mm. at that! Oh yes! Er and they thought of, I mean they thought the world of their their animals and but Yes. er when you were in the trade like mine if you didn't do a good job the man never come back to you, there was a, there was a blacksmith farrier in every village! Yes. Some villages had two Mhm. And if you didn't do the job properly you didn't get the job and if you didn't get the job you went hungry! Course! So that er that made you do it properly! Yes. Yes, they were a And there was no there was no if you hadn't earned a shilling you'd got nothing to eat had you? That's right. Necessity being a good driver. Absolutely! Well, yeah! Yeah. Erm, Hector often quotes one particular instance which illustrates that very well er a as recently as your time, after you were er er shoeing Yeah. in your own business and everything, er people often say what did you used to charge? And it was six and eight pence for a set of shoes on a Six and eight pence, yes. heavy horse, a land horse such as a Suffolk, as most of them were, erm but times were so tight that there was a farmer who used to send his horse with his horseman right past here and go another mile down the road to, to the next village to Kettleborough where there was ano , there were two farriers there Yeah. and one of them was doing them a halfpenny cheaper! Ooh! Six and seven pence halfpenny. Halfpenny And the farmer thought that it would Payed him to do it. to send them an extra mile each way and the extra Really! time that took to get them shod a halfpenny cheaper! And things were as tight as that! As tight as that? Yeah. Yes! Yeah. Yes. Mm. So I suppose, now would, could that possibly be called a false economy? What was he using up It probably was. time? Well if that was, I meant that would be today Yes. but er in them days there was no such thing as false economy, I'd and I, economy didn't come into it No. else he'd of I mean No. er People didn't set the same cost value on time as they Time. I was going to say, time do now. didn't count in the same No and er It really didn't seem to No. it's very funny that! Mm. If you're if you hadn't earned the money well you didn't go into it in detail and get the time and motion study man No. in to look at the job did you? Just thought That's right. well we'd better pull ourselves together and see if we can put this right! That's right. Er you never really went into it to see where you had lost the money. No. No. Er but you just grabbed a little harder so that you made ends meet That's right. By the result you Yeah. Yeah. would see that you had to work a bit Yeah. harder and There was no no working out to see how you could do anything cheaper. No. No. No. Aha. But any economy that was made or in the early days of Hector's er business, I know, was always saving material rather than time. Yes. Erm and the instinct remains doesn't it? Oh yeah! Your your instinct is to save a bit harder. an odd bit of se steel or iron off a bar which the modern man would say well there's no point in saving that because by the That's right. time you've looked Yeah. for it and found it when you want it er, it would have paid you to cut a bit off a new bar. That's it. Time costing as much Yes. as it now does. Time now Yeah, that's right. is er, is the main driving thing but in your early days it was material every time. Oh material every time! Erm tell Edith Labour about some of the er er oh normal economies that were made, like, erm making odd links Well, oh well the horse into staples and all that sort of thing. well the horse shoes you see, we used to we used to weld one and a half old horse shoes together in the fire to make one new one again. Really? Ooh yes! They weren't thrown One turned the other way on top We of the other? used to get one shoe and a ta , in the middle so that, so that cut the half new one Yes. turn it over on itself then the other one we used to half Oh! and put the other piece in between the two and make a sandwich Golly yes! so you'd got a piece that shape, half new one Yes. and that was all welded together in the fire into a straight bar And then you'd start all over again! and then you'd start all over again! Oh I see. You didn't use Mm. that as a shoe you then Re made it an a new Re-shape it. piece of metal? Yes. And then Yes. yeah, and then re re-used it to shoe. Mm. Made another shoe out of a That's right er yes. And that was a genuine economy then. Oh yeah! Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Er Erm old cart tyres we used to split them up the middle and made shoes. Did you? Oh yes! Er Because they were made of the right kind of iron? Yeah. Er And erm you see, we used to when old shoes do you see, you could only use them a certain number of times by welding them up Yes. er after they got so you hadn't got no more life in them we used to weld short bits onto . Really? Yeah. Still all done in the fire. Yeah. Wired? Old chains And when they wore thin on the end and we had to put a new link in we never threw the two halves of the link away, we pointed them and made them into staples. Really? Because the middle part of the link wasn't worn you see, that was still a good bit of metal in it. Yes, course. Yeah. Isn't it tragic to think how far from that we've moved? Yes , it is really. Yeah, mm. Yes, it's And it's so wasteful u it's all throw away Yeah. now isn't it? Yes. Yeah. It seems morally wrong. It hurts us Yeah. who've known Yes. the other thing doesn't it? Yes it does! Yeah, yeah. Mm. It goes against the grain terribly! And I am if at five minutes to five, or five minutes to leaving off time whatever it was and you wouldn't say well we'll get ready to go home you had to pick a half a link up make it into a staple and throw it in the box. Yes. That was ready for next time and you've saved That was ready for when Yeah. that time. Mm. Yeah. Yes. I forget what it was you used to make old horse rasps into because for Ooh yes! farrier has a, has a file with very, very coarse teeth on one side That's right. and slightly less coarse on the other Yes. is used for rasping the the hoof erm I can't remember what you used We used to use all sorts of things. used the old ones for. Hooks, flashers. Because that's a special hard steel isn't it? It's hard steel, now. It's not ordinary iron is it? They used to use, make them into flashers and hooks for hedge cutting and Mm. hoes for chopping out sugar Mm. beet. Yes, because of course you had all the equipment to shape it up anew Yeah. didn't you? Yeah. Mm. You could make whatever sort of shape you wanted from it I should Yeah. imagine . Yep! Mm. Yeah. That's an i ,i interesting thing talking about the names of the tools too erm flashers and hooks, now in other parts Now you never hear that. of the country you would probably hear them called a slasher and a what? I mean, nearly all people think a hook is a hook don't do, for hanging Yes. things on? Mm. Yes. Well in Suffolk you see, a hook is a thing for cutting the hedge. Yes A hooker. a a curved scy a sickle type A , yeah. shaped thing. Yes. Yes. Or a chopper. Mm. Yes. Yeah. I see. And you just call that a hook? A hook, yeah. So you di , did you call the thing you were doing hooking or not? What er Wi with hook, would you say When you were using it that you were hooking No you'd be the hedge or not? You'd be hedging. You're hedging. Yeah, hedging them. Yes, I see. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, The tool was a separate name? Yeah. Yeah. Really? Aha. Yeah. Yeah. And did you have to repair things, well you probably did, er farm instruments, I don't mean the big implements but things like their scythes and what Oh yes! have you? We used to ma , we used to buy the scythe blade and Well that was the blacksmith's bread and butter, that kind of thing. and do all the other iron work on it, you see, yes. Yes. Oh yes! Mhm. Yeah. Hoes and things like that were all er hand made. Ha! Spuds, dock spuds thistle spuds. Have you come across a spud? Now how do you spell that, S P A D It would be G D. G E. Yeah. I think it would be S P U D D, yeah. Yes? Oh just a s Yes? Spud. Yes. Sped? Spud. I think so. I think so. Really? Yeah. Th , it's a dialect word really. Oh not erm, not a spadge Yo er No. I heard the name spadge when I was No, it would be spud wouldn't it? No,spud. Really? Yeah. It's probably in the dialect book, I haven't looked it up. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. I'm rather And another good old word is the crome, now er that was one I came across for the first time when I came into Suffolk, the crome. I jolly soon learnt what a crome was, I didn't ask I waited to find out. learn a foreign language Yes. isn't it? Yes. Yes. What, what was that? Well a a Mm mm. crome is a He couldn't believe I didn't know what a crome was! that's ooh ah well either two or four times er turned down on a long handle for pouring things er out of the, I mean like, when I used to I know what it is now. when they used to put er the muck on the fields they used to put so many loads of eight and so many heaps of the well, when they pulled it out of the room they'd pulls out the crome. Like a fork bent at right angles. Angles. Oh! It's the ideal thing for that job Yes. you see. Yes. A fork , only bent over. I see! Mhm. And the old Yes. the real old gardeners and I mean well every house had one because they used to grow their own vegetables didn't they? That's right. Well when they dug the garden, after they'd dug it they always cromed it down with a crome before they planted anything. Really? Used the crome as the rake. Aha. Now could that be Mm mm. the same sort of thing that Noel bought last year when he saw one of the men in the village, using it to pull out a lot of weed from undergrowth, really I expect so. I expect so. it's er,i and it's got three prongs like that, and there's, I think, an arrowhead shape on each prong. Ah that'd be the modern ones. Yes. Yes, that would be Yes. the modern The modern one, but er adaptation. Yeah. Yes. That'd be the modern one. Similar principle. Yes. Sim sim Mhm. Yes. Yeah. It is Yeah. erm, for getting up a lot Yes. of weed? Yes. Yeah. The old style crome would be a thing about as wide as that Yeah, about ten What about ten inches wi and the Mhm. would be Yes and and the would be parallel Parallel. four times, wouldn't they? Four. And e , equally distanced. Fo for that work. Ah yes! Mhm. But for pulling the muck out of the tumble they only have two. Oh! Two tines. Did they? Yeah. More like a pitch fork bent at right angles then? But bent at right angles. Yes. That would be a muck crome? That'd be a muck Yes. crome. Yeah. And was a lot of straw in with that? Oh that was all straw, do you Ah! see? Because otherwise you couldn't have pulled No. er, sort of muck without No no. No. straw could you? No , no. No. But straw Yeah. of course. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. And the tines on a muck crome are flat, whereas the ones on an ordinary one for all the work were either round or square. I see. Yeah. Yes. So I came across these things you see when we were first married because I used to write out all Hector's bills for him, by hand before we had a typewriter Mhm. and of , I'd come across these words you see, I'd think crome? Crome, what is that? You know ! Yes. Even to spell it And gradually the in the first place Yeah. you needed So I had to to know. yeah, so I did have to guess a great deal Mm. because no good looking in the dictionary for a lot of these things. No. No, no, no Mm. no. no. No. I assumed that a crome was C R O M E, and I still do! Yes. cos I've never come across anything else! Well I mean all the, all the all the dialect words are Phonetic really spelt aren't they? They have to be! They're spelt as you say them. They have to be! They are , that's true. Mm mm! They are phonetic. They're spelt how you say them so they can be spelt er ten different ways in the same village! And still be right! That's right, I see. Because there's no there's no dictionary spelling Cos I mean, I'd for a lot of them. well I I spells how I say it. Mm. Yes. Er somebody up the road er hundred yards would spells how he Mm. say it. I I used to notice that And there's just that little bit of It was phonetic spelling! Yes! Yeah! Yeah. When the cards were, from the er, the workshop would come in which the lads had done their work, I mean, one of them, I know dear old Pete, in particular, he'd write for crome, C R double O M, because that's how he'd say it. Croom. Yes! Yeah , croom. Yes! Yes. But it's still right. Yes! And very often the O, in the Suffolk dialect goes to an ooh doesn't it? Ooh yes! Yeah. Yes! Yes. Mhm. Home. Eith either a long ooh, or a sort ooh, like er, like in It's as a room or mostly a short one because Mm. that's a lazy language the Suffolk dialect innit? I suppose it is in a way. I suppose a lot You cu of dialect is. cut out this Yes it is isn't it? cut everything short don't you? Yes. Mm. Oh yeah. Yes you do. Yes. But it's quite different from the unpleasantly lazy speech that you get now, for instance, Lancashire i it's Yes. not true Lancashire that's spoken up there, it's a lazy you Yes. know up the city Yes Yeah. yes, yes, yes. that sort of thing. Nothing like over Yes. No. here No. dialect. Yeah, same as the erm what you get from the outskirts of London, the home counties, I call Yes. that ugly too! It is! True cockney is a treat to listen to. That's right. But there's a lot of adulterated cockney in the home counties, I used to hear it a lot in Hertfordshire. Yes. Erm, especially in the war because the evacuees of course, would come along and of course Yes. all the local children picked it up, of course they did! And we'd all go home talking like them and our mothers complained ! Er, but it was interesting all the same. It was interesting to hear them. Indeed! Yes. But that a thousand do you see a the dialects are going Yes. and they'll soon be gone and one thing which annoyed me er a Scotsman or a Welshman or an Irishman can go on television they'll accept them and they can talk their You mean as a newsreader or a a presenter of programme lingo, as a newsreader, as a presenter don't you? Exactly! Mm. and yet, if anybody go on there with a southern dialect they wouldn't well they wouldn't have them there! That's true, isn't it? Cos they aren't talking the queen's English! It's taking a Yes. long time for dialects to be accepted but I think I think that boundary is giving way Well I hope frankly. it will universally because Mm mm. I feel the Scots make a tremendous fuss about their Mm. speech and Mm. Yeah. their traditions! Mm. Yeah. You never hear on the whole the Englishman saying but I'm English! Mm. No. No you don't. We're Do you? We're too No, no. self-effacing aren't we? And yet they'll a But they they'll accept the big proposals Mm. of television and radio Yes! Yes! and that . Yes. That's right. Top jobs for them! Mm. But when you te And yet if you go for a top job in the city or anywhere an and start talking in the southern dialect they'll you. Yeah, you're, you're made a laugh of aren't you? Absolutely! Yes. That's very true! It is extraordinary! It's also true that up in Mm. Scotland they don't like to hear English accents on their television and news. Well I never! They much prefer to have their own people. Ooh! But how often do we listen to a Scottish accent? Scot yeah! And every time a trade unionist comes on. Mm. I'm afraid Yeah. we've got a little phrase, another Yeah. bloody Scot we say! Yeah. Yeah , yeah well you do! Yeah. And then you've got them You do! with the roughest of the Yes! the trade Yeah. unionists! Yes! Yeah. pretty well Scot Yeah, that's always They are! They are! Yeah. Yes. Yes. So we've been perhaps a little Mhm. bit erm reticent Yeah. about our dialects. Yes. Er Yes, yes. I I But er think it's time they But I'm not gonna change, if anybody don't, but if they can't accept me No, I don't really think so ! well they must er Well er , you can't say that it's hard to understand because I'm a Londoner and Yeah. for a long time I have been Yeah. and you never say anything that I don't understand, unless you were to use a word like crome. Well quite Oh yeah. a word, an Yeah actual word Yes. Yeah. that you've never come across. Yeah. Mm. But after all, once is enough, and once you know, you know don't you? Exactly! You don't forget. No! No. Erm You don't. No. No I That's right. I found coming into Suffolk from Hertfordshire I hadn't heard the, any East Anglian dialect before at all erm I didn't find it difficult, there were only two cases and I can remember thinking there were two people er, one of whom is still alive, er who I had great difficulty in understanding and I thought when I can follow both of them without any difficulty I shall know I really belong. Yes. And, it didn't take long with one of them, that was Dennis Mm, Dennis . and the other one, I don't know whether you knew him, I think he lived in Earlsome for a time didn't he? No, well Monksome Didn't he? Monksome Monksome Erm, a chap called Ben erm No, I don't No. I expect he was days before and my word he was difficult to follow! Was he? Yeah. Yes. Er he spoke fast, that was the problem, most Oh yes! Suffolk people don't. No, they don't. They give you time to listen and time to think They do. but he spoke quickly with a very strong accent and that Yes. took me a lot of years before I could and I was so pleased when once I was able to say to you I've Ben had been in the shop and we'd had a chat hadn't we? Yeah. You and me and him and Joe , was another Yeah. one and we'd had a chat for a long, long time and I said to him afterwards, I was able to understand everything he said! Wonderful! I was so pleased ! That's an achievement ! Yes ! You know one thing that's striking me at this moment actually, when you talk about when you came into Suffolk and you Mm mm. met er, Hector and you told me once before you had no eyes for anyone else there. That's right. Perfectly true! Erm , in these days when er, so large a proportion of marriages breaks down Mm. erm it seems to me that the marriage that has an interest to your occupation, let's say, in the man's hands Mhm. if you like Mhm. er, although you've got your own artistic contribution which you also combine with True, yes. Hector's work That has been a great erm strength to us. Oh, I think that's a a tremendous Yes. strength to a marriage! Yes. Yes. I feel the same with Noel Yes. if there's something really interesting that you have Yes. between the two Yeah. of you Yes. Yeah. erm, you don't give up at the first little hurdle. Course you don't! No, No. No It makes an incredible bond doesn't it? Doesn't it? Absolutely! Yeah. I feel that. Yes! Yeah. Yes. Makes it a good recipe for a good marriage. Ooh yes! Yeah. Yes. It really does! And I th , I think about a great deal because it's a very strange, it's a very strange thing to talk about but when I came to Suffolk, I might have told you this before er, I had hardly been away from home at all, I was only seventeen when I first met him Mm. and I had a very sheltered life, I was an only child, I hadn't been around much, I hadn't stayed away from home erm and I came to Suffolk to visit a girl penfriend who was working at Brandeston Hall and erm she at that time was expecting to get engaged to a chappy in the village here who was, and still is a friend of Hector's and ours, and they didn't marry in the finish but she at that time wanted me to come up to Suffolk to see her and to meet this chappy who she thought she was going to marry and erm so, it was holiday from the art school where I was and I thought well why not? I'll erm, I'll venture and, and my parents said yes, that would be alright and so er so I came along and erm of course, it happened that he was in the he was in the forge talking to Hector on the first evening I came and that was how we met. Mm. And erm,i it was an extraordinary thing! But added to that, I can well remember staying at Kettleborough Chequers erm and er walking along from Kettleborough to Brandeston erm th the very next morning after I'd come here and I think it was before I think it was quite likely before we had we had actually met, I don't know whether it was the first day or the second Yeah, that we met in in the shop there but the strong impression I had is walking over the hill from Kettleborough where the gun club now is walking down into this valley and seeing that view of this little end of the village nestling in the hollow and I can remember feeling a extraordinarily strong sensation that I could easily live there Yes. I could belong there Yes. and I had never felt it anywhere else and I've never felt it since! Isn't that wonderful! But it, there was something that felt right. I yes, I really believe in that Yes. feeling! A sense of belonging. Most extraordinary! I belong here. Yes. Yes. Because I hadn't been around much, I hadn't been away from home Really? and i it was quite forcible! Yes. And er Marvellous! Yes. I think if one's receptive to things like that Yes. you know, it si , it Yes. it strikes you Yes. doesn't it? Yes Mm. It does. And er There was a rightness about it. And you don't forget it because No! you're young enough to be so impressed by it. Mhm. Yes. Yes. That's wonderful! Yes, there was a rightness about it. Right. Okay . Ha. Erm and er I've felt that same sense of rightness at many times over these years, this is now our thirty seventh year? Thirty seven, yeah I Nineteen think so. No, thirty eight. Thirty eight. This is nineteen ninety two. Yeah. This'll be our thirty eighth year in December. So it's several. Erm there have been times doing work which we have er, worked on together different jobs when I have thought, yes this is what I'm here for. Yes. Very, very strongly! Yes. And never, never more so than, of course, working on the sword stand. Yes. Never more so than that! That was wonderful I thought wasn't it? I the work I'd done in the past the training I've had the experience I've had with Hector and his work that was all leading up to that. All coming to it. It all came together. Yes. I can quite see that really. It all came together. Because Yes. that was a whole thing wasn't it? It was the culmination. Connection with the Yes. city. It was! It was! Er Mhm. the ancientness of the Mm. actual Yeah. thing Mhm. you were copying. The significance of what it was for. For. Absolutely! Yes. Everything Absolutely! about it. And now, of Yes. course, it sits Mm. America with Yeah. Mm. its sword in it Yeah. Mm. on certain occasions. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. It's a it's a permanent tribute to your It's collaboration It's an extraordinary forever in America. it is an extraordinary thing, an Yes. amazing, an amazing sensation Yeah. for it to be, isn't it? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. It's wonderful! Yes. Yes. And erm Feel like I've done a shift already. I know. We haven't been away. It's the time of year where you're starting to think I wonder if we'll be nearly finished. I'm yawning already! I know. I dunno what I'll be like at seven o'clock tonight. Mm. I don't do anything in the morning you know. Tell me when there's a at lunchtime. Yeah. I only did about an hour's work, that's all I did. Some of them I did. What shall I do now? I know. Should I get ready? Should I take the, take the dog I know. out or It all depends really Am I to take the dog, the dog was left at mam's because I'm gonna be out over Yeah. six o'clock and that when I would normally walk in. I could nay of told the Yes. Well I'm gonna have to erm phone Tony and he in, he might be going home. And then come and pi pick me up. Yes. Probably better if I just stay at work and come and pick me up. Tt! Oh ! It's stupid! Come and have a cup of coffee and Tony can pick you up and all. Geoff dropped the radio in the bath and put a hole in it? Who? Put a bath, a hole in the radiator? No. In the bathroom? In the bath. In that bath? We need a new bathroom suite. So now you can't have a bath? I've a gotta bung stuff . Come across my number? Well I can have one every sort of, but I just get into the bath just after the water is slipping out. And he's pulling the sink Oh no! off the wall to do summat and just re-cement or something so I've gotta wash my toothbrush, and tooth and wash my face in the kitchen sink. How are you getting home?in there alright? I'm gonna have to get Tony to come and pick us up. Like th are you gonna stay on another day or what are you doing? Are you coming in with me and in the library or whatever? Oh no! Being dropped at half past eight in the morning Yeah. till two o'clock? Well I've got the flat there Oh yeah. and that wait. Mm. Oh I can't, I can't work in the morning though. I worked in my room. I wanted to go, go to the library but I thought I'd start in my room so You know if I came in to see Kim, your room, we'd never get anything done. Yeah that's it. And then once Helen and that had woken up that was about half eleven she woke up and then it like, oh,our provisions and then we started talking and everything else together like Do you work from half eight till half eleven? Well, she . I didn't, I work, I started at half nine and I finished at half ten and I went to you know. I started about five to eleven, and I finished at twelve. Then I had to get ready to go to the bank. To get the So is Tony gonna be staying awake until the time that you finish there? Well I was saying to Alison, the only thing I can do is when I phone him he's gonna come. Go this morning and then come straight here. Oh! More than likely. I know. I know. Maybe she'll stay pulled squealing out of a hole, I think I am deeply concerned about anybody here today that can turn that blind eye because what their terrier men are doing is dog fighting, make no bones about it, they won't be interested in laying the scent, they will not be interested in being retrained and helping your fraternity. They're there for one reason and one reason only I know, cos I've been involved in fox hunting, I've shot and fished but I'll tell you something, was also trained to hunt humans, going back many years ago, when I was in the Falkland Islands training for the event that happened eventually. One of the things that I used to do was train and I know the feeling, I know the excitement, I know the adrenalin that pumps round the body, when you go in for the kill. I know because I've actually done it. I look back now and think we are actually still doing that, not in the military aspect, in civvy street, we've got people, real nice people, you talk to them on the street and you get them at the kill and the hackles go up, you can see the adrenalin pumping round their body, you can see the kind of excitement in their eyes and you can see the terrier men grabbing by the the scruff of the neck, bleeding and then throwing. Did you watch the v video when the the terrier men having a fox fought for its life, okay to have killed it there and then I would have accepted. I could have turned a blind eye, but to grab it and to throw it to the hounds I think was absolutely abysmal. I hope today we can get rid of this issue we can put it where it belongs in the House Of Commons, we can get rid of it and make sure that Leicestershire helps that and I am still willing to talk to the hunt. I am still willing to get a forum together. I am still willing to negotiate and talk to the organisations and look at the sport. Keep the pageantry. Keep the jobs. Let's go forward together, not in not against each other Adrian,it's near time Let's go forward together. Thank you Chair for the time. Thank you for listening and I hope today that we all vote just this once and get rid of it out of our hands into the place where it belongs the House of Commons. Thank you Chair. I will now put the vote on the amendment. That's a surprise. You, you're voting on Mr amendment. Would you please indicate whether you're voting for or against or whether you are abstaining.

The result of the vote is for car is carried forty two to thirty three. Hooray We will now proceed with agenda item number six report of the policy and resources committee. Mr the agenda item number six please. After this agenda item we will take a tea break. Mr . Thank you chairman, I think that I'll take it easy until the chamber empty and so. Can you proceed Mr ? I cannot find the page now through all that excitement here when I get to it I'll get to it some time page twenty five I'll be alright. Can I say Chairman on on this report of the policy of the old policy and resources committee on the internal management of local authorities that was a very important issue because it's I all issues are important but in particular the the seal the report is to inform the council of comments which the policy and resources committee has agreed to make the association of county councils on the recommendation of the joint working party on the internal management of local authority Now I'm sure you, you've waded through the report at least some of the during the last er week or so that er that you've had it well I would advise you to turn to page thirty and thirty one because there's lot eas and it'll make life easier for you, if you do that and there on the bottom half of page thirty you will see the decisions of the policy and resources committee. I can't remember at the policy and resources why it was decided by a majority because in in replying to this report on making our comments to this report,I first had consultations with officers to go through some of the items that we had done and issues that we had covered in this authority especially the members' services sub committee and we knocked off the bare bones of er a report to the policy and resources committee and the policy. Should keep them brief. A result, I can't hear myself speaking if I are the policy and resources committee there were other they were erm er in the debate there were some very good cases brought in to it and some erm good recommendations and this is why I'm surprised I'm er forget now why, there were some who were er against by majority because I believe that when we look down on the decisions of the P N O, we have made some very good recommendations if I say so it says on twenty, paragraph twenty in and you people on this authority, members of this authority have been saying a a clear definition of the role of the local government now and for the next twenty years, should underpin any consideration of local authority management structures and the role of members and therefore the joint working party's consideration begin from an inadequate base. So what we're saying is really is that the defi definition and the role of local government should have been debated I think from starters. When then, then we could have, we could have operated amid recommendations from a a different base. On three, if you see then three that we the county council will not support a development of capital, cabinet or executive management, arrangements which would tend to concentrate power in the hands of a relatively few members stifle public debate and diminish the role of the majority of members. I think we we have quite some time on this one and I'm sure you will all agree that a reply that we do not go down the road of a cabinet government. I never, never would be a believer as was others, of a a cabinet government. I'm sure it's been operated in some places but your policy and resources committee do recommend that we do not go down that road. For as said with all three of the county councils not support the taking of new powers to promote experiment cabinet of executive management arrangements. What they've been saying is that some authorities might have experiments in the cabinet arrangement we're not advising to go down that road because and on which point we don't agree with that type of of government. And on H Little H and I'm skipping through them because I'm sure a lot of you would like to get to the tea pot. Here, here. Here, here, I second that on H on page thirty one very important one, the county council welcomes the recognition by the joint working party of the importance of meaningful support services to the elected members and the recomme recommendation that the Secretary of State should review and clarify the powers of local authorities to meet costs of services provided to members to enable them to carry out their duties as councillors Now the erm members appointments, appointments of member services sub have been discussing this issue and I would like to point out to members that we are not claiming the amount allowable for the paying members allowances we erm we're way below the limit that's allowable by the government Now before anyone say well what have you done about it? I and some others have tried to do something about it because you'll remember in the last year last two years, we have put in a a sum of money in the budget to increase the allowances for members and for resources to to support members. Not because I suppose and I must condemn any particulars group we all, in the end said not this time. But I say you're foolish not to have put that in the budget. Because it it's an essential part as of running a good authority and that is to have the resources to support the members of that authority because it is a profession, a semi professional job you sit on committees that make decisions. I think you should, allowances should be at at least support you in that and also from those allowances other resources that provide for research etcetera for the members. So I make no apology for raising this one. I will never make an apology for increase in member's allowances and resources to support members in training etcetera and the tools to do a good job, given the tools, give you the tools to do a good job. I hope I will, that we will have support in it on this issue and I don't want to take up all the time but it is something that members do approach me in, and and others on the members' services sub and I hope we have time Chairman to er give this report some consideration and let's say it's a v , it's a very important if you Chairman want any additionals to the recommendations, or if you say we're going too far in the recommendations because those recommendations you have down in front of you will be forwarded on and you're officers and your your your policies and resources they've given some time on on this report and therefore on the bottom of page thirty one the motion to be moved says that the comments of the policy and resources committee and the recommendations of the joint working party and the internal management of the local authorities be noted for submission to the Association of County Councils as appropriate. I move Seconded, reserve the right Mr Thank you Chairman. these are recommendations from a joint working party D of E of the erm local authority association and they are to almost unbelievable for us to consider and I can only assume that the that we must remember that this is really a response to what I call Heseltine's last squeeze which was the idea of executive mayors and so in a sense lip service which has to be paid somewhere along those lines but it does recommend that we think seriously about cabinet govern government about single party committees and I can't imagine how anybody in their right minds would argue now that the cabinet government when they see what cabinet government leads to in Westminster and what de facto cabinet government leads to in majority ruled councils up and down the country erm, there is of course a I think a misleading er er brownie point the idea of relaxing restrictions on members allowances but members must realise why that is in there. It's in there because you can't have executive style cabinet government in local government unless you pay executive councillors executive salaries, it's got nothing to do with the idea of you getting thirty five pounds rather than thirty three if we stay here all day erm I would just, I'm really wisely advised to make one point er Mr er was c wondering why this didn't have majority support actually most of it did I think Mr will confirm that he and his colleagues were happy to support all of the proposed responses from A to J on page thirty and thirty one but were not happy with response B and I would like to er that erm that er when our responses do go forward it is made clear that apart from little paragraph B there was all party support because I really feel that our local authority associates need to know that and erm I hope that will be little B was er a piece that erm certainly I and my colleagues supported er, rather . I mean in response to the general tone of the argument which was they want us to increase the leadership roles in the, in in local government and in in local communities and local councils we would we thought that that was inconsistent with the continual removal of the responsibilities from local government into quangos and er and er Mr and his colleagues were not happy with that. So with that er suggestion Chairman I'll, I think I'll let you all get to tea. Mr Thank you sir. Yes that's erm correct er the majority view's recommendations er did come from discussions and a large measure of agreement erm between er er all three parties on this council. Er and Professor is right that it was paragraph B er which at the time was A A er it's now B B, that caused er me and er my colleagues some difficulty erm in er policy and resources and it will be the reason for which we don't support it this afternoon. Erm er perhaps I could refer just briefly as to why not. Paragraph B suggests that er we're dealing with a report which proports to address er community leadership and representation that's not the purpose of the report. The purpose of the report is set out in erm paragraph two three of appendix one and that's on page thirty seven of the council report er which says quite clearly that things are changing in all areas of the public sector. New management styles are being developed to deal with new roles new circumstances. Local governments at the forefront of this changes. The local authority has to look not only to its traditional role as provider of services but also, this is the critical bit to one where the emphasis is now more on specifying requirements, coordinating functions, monitoring performance. The existing committee structure and many features of common practice erm as the best ways of managing service provision. It may not be so any longer and it's because this report deals with this aspect that I feel this a vital and important matter er that that in fact comes in front of us. Unfortunately erm er, the er argument has been sidetracked into a spat about whether you've got more powers or you haven't got more powers and er and other matters and er er I don't think if we're gonna get a sensible response to the D o E that we need to axe er er grind axes in that way. There's no doubt Chairman local government is changing erm the Leicestershire management initiative actually acknowledged the need to change to an enabling authority. Would that it were as easy as sticking your hand up to vote for it Because I have to say that I see no evidence since that motion approving the management initiative was passed of Labour and Liberal members doing any more than paying lip service. We've had at least two opportunities in the past two years for reorganising our own structure. We started with committee structure those attempts have foundered on intransigence over the whole nature of a review process. Even as late as last May we had the opportunity for restructuring a number of committees we flunked it. What in fact oh no. What came forward was the lowest common common denominator, the least er the least that could be agreed without any argument. It was a timid first step as to what, compared with what we ought to be doing. Well thank you indeed. If you'll allow it. Oh, you're too kind You're too kind. Now chairman. Chairman wants his tea. Chairman wants his tea not yet Mr . I do If we are going to deliver to the people to whom we as elected members owe the highest duty, that's the people who are in receipt of our services the sort of quality service that we, that they deserve then I have to say that we can have as many reports of this nature as we like, but you have got to acknowledge the need to change and you have got to stop resenting the rights of parents and governors to run schools, you've got to stop being obstructive to competitive tendering and you have got to stop arguing for the retention of services where it's patently obvious that there's over provision. Now but you don't have to but it in fact if, there's no point that's it get you do your arguing through the Chairman If you wish to continue or you wish to recreate a nineteenth century corporatist local authority that's fine. If you wish to deliver Inappropriate services at a higher cost than necessary to members of the public, that's fine. At least have the honesty to admit it and not to vote for an a management initiative that says we're gonna become an enabling authority and then it subsequently to deny every single measure that will allow that to happen. Thank you. Sorry Mr Thank you Chairman. Erm I heard er Professor have a go at cabinet government. Can I throw one back at him? Because one of the Liberal Democrat experiments in Tower Hamlets er devolving real power, real power to area councils or or community councils has suddenly backfired and allowed a noxious element to it, to creep in because, if I might just carry on. What happens is that the council is Liberal Democrat controlled and the area council is Labour controlled and these two fight and that's allowed the third obnoxious force to creep through so it's not just Conservative cabinet government that is the problem. Gentlemen, I I do want to make a point because I know we're not ready for elected Mayors or cabinet governments but I do think we c we can do a lot more to er improve our own internal workings here. Th there's still too much trivia on committee agendas. W we still seem to debate certain things three, four and five times they creep their way through to the main committee and full council and I have to say that the point in para B about the report we've been sent not recognising the reduction in local er government responsibilities it it is it's a bit rich, because our response to that report doesn't recognise that when I first arrived here Chairman we had the education department which was responsible for all the schools, six colleges of further education, college of art, college of agriculture, the teacher training college at and a major polytechnic. It had three education sub committees, a major education committee, numerous sub committees, working parties and all sorts. All that's now gone. Schools run themselves some have left the authority, we still have three education sub committees a major education committee, numerous sub groups and working parties and it's gone time we recognised the changing world and streamlined the members side of the education department in the same way that the officer side's been streamlined and slimmed down. Thank you Er, Mike Mrs Like insisting that tenant. you've spoken. I would like to Mrs , Mrs is speaking. Mrs is speaking Chairman, my point of order, my point of order I second and I reserve my remarks I was waiting to see if you called me last. Right. I assume you were asking me if I got any remarks last I got you down in sight yes. Thank you Chairman. I'd like to congratulate the officers and the members on the formulation of these decisions. All of them as far as paragraph B is concerned it deals with the reduction in local government responsibilities and the growth of non-elected bodies. Need I remind council about such things as charge capping the fact that the government wishes to remove non-elected members or a majority of them, from police committees. Need I remind council of the fact that the funding for grant maintained schools will be entirely in the hands of fifteen people that are nominated by the government and nobody else. No. And as far as non-elected bodies goes about two fifths of all public money is now spent by quangos who are not accountable to the people of this country in any way shape or form so I recommend all of these decisions, including paragraph B. It is absolutely essential that the democratic base of this country is not eroded in any way. There should be a majority of the citizens involved in the decision making of local government and national government. I and my colleague here have the pleasure and the privilege of serving on a vast majority of a Liberal Democrat erm local authority. Heaven help it if we or any other minority among a majority party, of any colour of any persuasion, was allowed to govern as an as an executive. That would be totally wrong and totally undemocratic and heaven help us if we ended back in the situation where we had a lady in number ten Downing Street who waved the hand bag at all and sundry without any thought at all for the democratic situation Can you be quiet please. The democratic base must remain as wide as possible and I commend all these paragraphs to council. Thank you. I'm advised that the Chairman can call the reserve, the speaker who reserved his remarks at any time. Now, I appreciate my, there wasn't time to overrule really but in this incidence do you wish to speak but if that point can be made so that it for future debate we know it. Right, would you want to speak, you reserved your remark. Not really, just to endorse the comments that councillor made. Every council, er every councillor on this authority is of equal value to the people who elected them er and to the electorate and their role is very much diminished by anything to do with a er executive erm er government of that nature. I endorse everything that was said and everything that said. Mr do you wish to reply? I must er thank Mr for really outlining what it's all about and cover all the issues because because Mr referred to no part being taken away. Mrs quite right, what about the quangos? They're growing up all over the place and as you say, Ernie he he he did say about education but whose gonna run education in the future same as social services, you'll soon find they'll social services up into the health service. The health service which we've ignored democratic likes of people just appointed. Is this wha what you want for the future? I think the I I'm pleased that this is in the in B, because let 'em know how we feel about it. We'll not follow these quangos, we're not for taking away the power, the power should mean at least we're accountable. Councils are accountable to the electorate and that's how it should be. Because because you say about, he is accountable to the people because the the councils win the ballot box. And the members? The members are accountable and let me go back about the committees. I make no apology for the number of committees that we have and I make no apology for the numbers on the committee. Because it makes sure that it is democratically run. Let me point out and another thing to that members are allowed to play as full a part in the decisions of this council. Because was before the observations of Mr it just that you're going back to cabinet government anyway cos you say t take a few on each committee, just have a few small committees and they'll do the job. I can tell you you're in for some trouble if you start that because I I is you you're all in trouble if you want to start these smaller committees, we have looked at the committees and as I say we make no apology for the number of committees or the number that's on 'em. But on the question of competitive tendering I think mentioned by Mr which he says we should have a different attitude. We will have a different attitude, we'll bear to watch what is happening in competitive tendering and to ask questions and to get the right the facts on competitive tendering because we found a lot of these round the competitive tendering don't you, don't you worry and we ain't finished with it yet I can tell you and also we have ev , the people who are, the in house, walking in the house, have a right to have some protection from it, to see that when we dole out those contracts that it least they are genuine and they've got a someone to see that that their interest is looked after. I would commend the motion as it stand Chairman and hope that the that the council will vote for it. And now I will take the vote. Those in favour please show. It think that's carried Chairman. Yes. those against. That's carried. That is carried right right, thank you. We will now have a tea break, back here at five and twenty to six. Right, I think we'll call them to order shall we. Yes, let's A thought er went, slipped by me er we must upon this council thank the committee staff that controlled the multitude outside, er they weren't trained for it but can the er thanks of this council for their endeavours in keeping the situation calm be recorded. Er, now then, next item er the Moat Centre Highfields youth er marked Mr . Chairman. Can I can I informally move section B on the policy and resources put forward. You can. Moat Centre and Highfield youth community centre because Chairman that there is er some amendments I'd formally move. Secretary has reserved the right to speak Chair. Amendments Amendments have we got. Amendment by Mr Erm, we feel we need to move this amendment, cos it appears to be the only way to actually get the council decision implemented Chairman and to avoid a continuation of the wrecking tactics used by the Labour group. Every time this matter's been before either committee or council there has been a majority in favour of the merger principles. The delay in making progress has blighted the development of the provision in the area and in particular, the leaking of the report of the problems of the moat centre has brought some dreadful headlines about the area and I hope whoever leaked that document is pleased with himself herself himself theirselves. Now, I understand Chairman that the Lib Dems have changed their minds now and succumbed to the demands of the Labour group I will not support this amendment. I I find this quite extraordinary Chairman after two years of consistently arguing and voting in committee and at council, they appear to have been bought off by the Labour group and now intend to to support a fudged half merger, half federation option. If they really believe that the merger was the best way forward, they must now be be supporting something that they know to be less than best and and this is now rendered all the bad feeling and all the destruction of the past two years, a complete waste of time. If this is what is offered as the advantage of a hung council, I fail to see the benefit. We remain convinced that full merger is the best way forward and the amendment will e enable the project to make progress If the Lib Dems have changed their mind Chairman and do support the forthcoming Labour amendment erm th the worst aspect for me is that I've lost a bet because Bob bet me a year ago that the Lib Dems would not last the distance and he's been proved right. Now what have we got. Mr . Thank you Chairman. I assume Chairman that that if this amendment is whether it is carried or not we should be debating the other amendments separately. Sorry I'm sorry I was, I was looking for speakers, I'm ever so sorry sorry Chairman. Yes. We we shall, if this amendment, whatever happens to this amendment the other amendment will be fought separately and it will be debated separately. there are no speakers on this so put the the amendment. Well may I, may I second it please Chair? If you yes Yep. Do you wish to speak on it? Yes please. I I do second it because if all aspects I actually supported, that is to say I support that the the first part of the of the amendment which is the motion from the policy and resources committee as well as the bit that has been er added on erm as far as the latter is concerned I support it, largely for the reason that Mr has explained. It is not a particularly satisfactory way of progressing I accept that. But on the other hand the delays that have been caused by procedural motions and I accept that that nevertheless contributed a great deal to added uncertainty and added unrest in the Highfields area. At one of the effects of that delay I suspect has been the need for the supplementary estimate which is measured, er mentioned in part B. A good part of that is I think, a consequence of the delay that we've had in implementing the wishes that this council has expressed before. Thirty seven thousand pounds is a lot of money it's a lot of money even compared with the five hundred odd thousand that's already in the revenue budget for er the operation of these two centres. It's even a lot of money I think compared with the what is it, one point four million pounds that is transferred th through the youth and community budget into the Highfields area and that itself is a lot of money when people recognise that we are actually spending the equivalent of one tenth of the total county youth and community budget in one area of the county. We had questions at the very beginning of this meeting which seems an awful long time ago now er asking for youth provision in other areas of the county. Well I'm sure that those other areas are, would be just as anxious of the people to have Can I have some respect for the speaker adequate youth and community provision in their areas. I know I would and I wouldn't blame anybody else for doing so. So, the situation in that is quite serious and it behoves us to take it seriously, it behoves us to make sure that if we are putting resources of that magnitude or of any magnitude perhaps, then we have to make sure that they are managed properly for the effective delivery of the services which we intend er that them to be used for. It's for that reason that I still support the original line which was to merge the centres with a common management structure headed by a single head of the project. That I support the addition that that we that we should get on with it as quickly as possible and I suppose also that I regret the support that the request for an extra thirty seven thousand or whatever it is pounds in order to enable that to be carried out. So therefore Chairman I I do in fact support the amended er motion. Professor Thank you Chairman. I agree with a great deal that has been said by Mr . He knows we have always been of the view that given the limited resources that the best cost effective use of those resources would be to merge the administration . But as he has also said,for longer that any of us care to remember all attempts at rational arguments over the best use of resources in Highfields have been drowned out by noise from the grinding of axes. Vested interests have defended the status quo with great skill and determination and they've had their axes sharpened using er sharpeners energised by the oxygen of Labour's irresponsible backing off. Money and effort that should have been devoted to supporting the ordinary people in Highfields has been wasted on power politics and I agree that it's time surely to put an end to that disgrace now there is a certain logic in Mr amendment, it basically says let us put the implementation of council policy in the hands of the director of education, let him take executive control and let us take politics out of it and if I thought that that would do what both Mr and myself want to happen I would support. But er unfortunately those on the ground who have shown their skill at wrecking anything that doesn't suit their purpose with the support of the Labour group, those on the ground will still be there and I don't believe that er giving the director of education the executive powers is going to stop them continuing to take the sort of action they've been taking. Nor do I actually think it's going to stop the Labour members of this council from continuing with their support. So I don't think that it's now the logical way forward. Furthermore Mr himself has said to me on more than one occasion that given the history of the situation it's unlikely that we would get anybody of sane mind to take over the running of the two centres. For that reason we will support the amendment that's been moved by Labour. Set a single head to a single head of the two buildings There will be a single budget which we've always argued for in the management committee the head of centre will and this is very important and I hope members are clear the head of centre which is the head of the Moat Centre which is the proposed under the amendment will be appointed within this financial year, will be appointed out of the existing budget. The reason why this amendment in my view is one that can take us forward is that it places responsibility now for clearing up the mess clearly where it belongs and that's with the Labour group. This is a Labour amendment it is up to them now to implement it implement it within existing budgets is what it says and we shall see whether they take their responsibilities as seriously as they should. Labour will now be on the line they will have to deal with the axe grinders instead of helping them to sharpen their axes and the difference between ourselves and Mr and I have great respect for Mr and I believe his attempt to keep the debate about the future of Highfields and Moat on a rational basis has been very positive but completely unsuccessful and I believe now that we have to look for a way forward. We are not being bought off by Labour. This is less than best but it's better than nothing, that's the point and it is very nearly what we have argued for from the very beginning. I think that Mr has lost his bet because we are a party who is not obsessed by ideology we are not prepared to act indefinitely like bulls in a china shop when the owners of the shop have an infinite supply of china We want to move forward and we want to move forward in the real world and the idea that a strong government and sticking to what you want through thick and thin when clearly you're not going to get the result you want, as indeed the government did over the poll tax, in the end you have to recognise the reality the Labour group, as much as anything else, are part of that reality. The responsibility will now be theirs and they'd better get on with it and better show things that they've been arguing and get along. Mr . I was er a little lost there er Mr Chairman. Do I understand you are handing over your responsibilities to the Labour group, washing your hands of them. You said twice just now it's up to the Labour to put this into effect. Now I don't call that er er democracy, that's a washing of the hands er I've followed with interest this Moat Centre which as you know is w w , is one of Highfield's many village halls erm For those of you that don't know can I remind you that in the last few years one million pounds of capital was spent on Moat Centre alone on the cost together the moment of running Moat Centre for Highfield's youth is five hundred thousand a year. ridiculous waste of money Now I suggest that the Labour and the Liberal think very carefully about this. You might get a backlash you might find that the rest of the citizens of this county want to know, want to know what on earth you're doing pouring money into this area when the rest of the county gets nothing. They'll also want to know why you're doing it, when there's been constant obstruction for two years. There's a supplementary estimate here. I'm delighted to have given them two er security men does it mean security men are now available for all the county? If any of us have got troubles at our schools where there's vandalism, will you provide us, at the tax payer's expense,with a security man? You pour the money into this, it's bounced back on you but as usual there is no limit. I've heard members from the other side say money doesn't matter this is democracy. This is what the people want and money must not interfere with their wishes. That only seems to apply in the Highfields area. I suggest that the Labour and particularly Liberal feel, think very carefully about the quality of service that is provided by this county er council cos at the moment there is neither justice or equity in it. There are areas that are just what they want things passed on the hoof. left, right and centre when anyone else outside these areas wants it we're told no money, no capital, can't be spent this year, wipe it off and I think you should be very careful or you might have a backlash where you least want it. Thank you. Mr Thank you Chairman. Erm I think really for Mr to talk about washing of hands er he's got some brass neck when I remember every year, every year I mean hopefully he won't be able to do this next year, what does he say it's your budget and he looks over there your budget, you implement it. If that's not washing of hands I'm not too sure what is. Er, Chairman erm, I do believe that this has always been an issue erm of vested interests and bureaucracy administration but all I want to say to members of the council today as a member of the youth and community advisory committee is that extremely serious er far reaching decisions are gonna have to be taken because we were told at the last meeting of that sub committee that just to stand still because of the changes in legislation regarding transfer of funds to the er F E funding council, we will lose a further two million pounds next year so even if we er do not have to find any cuts within our own budget that money is going out of this authority's budget it may come back in in commissioning agreements but because of the different timescale that the funding council works on we probably won't know that when we come to set our budget and really the issue for the Labour group I think in particular as councillor has said, is the question of budgetary control. Because I I would say that all members of the council face those kinds of cuts. Faced with those kind of possible reductions in service, if there is a penny one penny more than necessary spent on administration and bureaucracy wherever it is in the youth and community programme that is gonna be less money for front line vision and the Labour group can have to think very, very carefully about that and the issue is gonna be that if we're spending too much money or if they're coming back to supplementary estimates which won't be available er given the financial situation next year if we're having two heads of centres or whatever when we could have one that is gonna mean less money for front line services to the people of Highfields and there'll only be one group that will be responsible for that, if that does come about and I think that's something that we all need to bear in mind because what we were told as members of that committee is that the youth and community budget is gonna be in for some very serious times in the future and it's mainly the government's fault because of the way they've decided to re-organise the situation it's going out of our hands into the control of an unelected body and like most members of this council I think we would oppose that but that's the reality of the situation and I could not support any increase of funds er for any community centres if I knew it was simply gonna be spent on administration. Thank you. Mr Could I have Mr Chairman cos it's a, is it an order of government to support Mr at the same time or should I do . No just deal with this and let their deal with the amendment as it is. As it is. I'm sorry come again clarify I said would it,in order now just to deal with the amendment on my own sir or support Mr at the same time? We've only got this one. No we've got the other amendment but it's not been moved yet. It's not been moved. No you'll have to deal with this one because the other one has not been moved yet. Right, I'll deal with this one I I'll deal with this one and be very careful as I say. I I wanted to make three points really. Er, I did at the last council urge that we actually needed to break the deadlock my er a and I thought that was very important. I was ruled out of order, I erm I there were point out then that twenty five new councillors and I understand it wasn't legitimate if I wanted to to restrict the vote only to those twenty five so that the rest of you would actually realise that this has gone on far too long, I only put that as a I think it is very, very important erm that we break new ground. At the last council meeting we did two things or two things have happened. One, we set up a w er er a working group which has brought together that consultation addressed that consultation argument and I would point out that Mr amendment er does clearly enshrine that as obviously something which is now seen as useful, er and I think that's important. The thing I don't like about this amendment is it actually moves us nowhere and we cannot after what we've seen over the summer, move nowhere. Now those of us who've been involved on the Moat Highfields sub committee will have a need to know that when we were faced with really serious and horrendous problems, we found when faced with the reality and a great deal of detailed information, that an extraordinary amount of three party cooperation was achieved. It resulted in the erm extra requirement for security which does happen to which Mr has referred and I I think it's it's very very important to realise that if that three party cooperation can be achieved as it should be, bearing in mind what Simon says that we are going to have to do this, with horrendous problems in the youth and community project in the future and we would be failing completely in our duty, not just to the people of Highfields,but to the people of this whole county if we simply allowed politics, as has been done in the past, to lead to entrenched positions and the idea of simply saying to the director, we are in a mess therefore will you please deal with it all is I think wildly irresponsible and I'm very very surprised indeed that erm that point should be put. The reasoned, the reasoned proposals which are contained in a very thought out amen which has in fact contains ideas submitted by many different people of different persuasions to try and ensure that ideas could be erm worked at solidly does break the endless delays. It means that there is a way of going forward, the only question that remains was that head of project as Professor said who is in their right mind would want to erm, apply for such a job at the moment, it's probably an unworkable idea. If in the future the single management committee on the two headed centre decide that they want a single headed project then only Pharuk hearing which I always subscribe to that it should be decided locally, they may have that said project I'm sure you'd agree, if they choose to have such one, if they feel that they need it, but we want to ensure, do we not, and the amendment doesn't do this that we actually get a move on, that we spend the money we have, what little there is and there is very little on delivering the services, that we fuse the bureaucracy which is clearly contained in the other and, clearly contained, it's spelt out in in in in tablets of stone in a way that's never been done before. It is extremely positive it sta , it clears these points up and and answers most of these questions so I would urge Mr Chairman that to on sheer education, on terms of provision of services, I'm not party to all of the politics , I agree with what you said, absolutely crazy. I would however I I with great trepidation as I don't think I've ever dared do it before, er is try to actually clarify the thoughts of my leader erm it is not erm, have I your permission erm I I I feel I feel he may, I feel that may have been a professional slip of the tongue i in saying that now be up to Labour, it is not up to Labour at all, it is up to all of u , it is up to all of us, it is up to all of us all, and you and you and you, you can't dump responsibility, it is up to all of us, all of us to work together and deliver an effective result because nobody gains anything in the eyes of the people of this county by allowing this thing to go on and on and on and what they feel is if we can't get to grips with it what on earth are we doing with our existence. That is why the amendment is a far, far better thing than this rather grubby amendment we have before us. Mr Thank you Mr Chairman. I've followed the events of of this erm unhappy but hardy perennial some time now erm I've found it unusual because there was no Liberal volte face until now and er quite a lot of things happened where the Liberals changed their mind and I naturally started to wonder what has happened to make this change of mind come about and all I'll say is I hope that it doesn't have much to do with events in other counties or with any by-election. Ooh, ooh, at least we have a mind. Thank you yes, are there I think this is unique er a unique occasion where we haven't got a Labour speaker so if there's no Labour speaker then Right, we'll press on those in ing I accept that. But Put those against. Those against the amendment is lost just. We now move have we another amendment? Yes the purple paper. The purple paper the mover please. Mr I've been I've been advised chair that I've made the same mistake as you did so. They're so particular aren't they sometime but there you are Chair, Chairman I'm grateful er from the indications that have been already made by a number of speakers that they are amenable to the contents of this amendment. Can I can I say before I do launch into the amendment to Mr that you have played your card at the last election and the Leicestershire public has resoundedly given their answer to your particular policies. So I don't think anyone here as an elected member, needs to defend their positions if they wish to move from a political or a bureaucratic policy to something which is more pluralist and much more representative of the kind of policies that this council should be discussing not only now but also in the future. No one has to defend anything to anyone. Chair and and at the same time can I say that you do not equate elitist views and pleasures and pastimes that they may have down in the county somewhere with the kind of deprivation that people face in the inner cities. You do not equate that, it is irresponsible and I'm s , I'm sorry that the these remarks were made earlier. Chairman, can I say briefly that the merger and I'm quite pleased that we've finally er there is a death knell to this this awful word, it's been bandied on for far too long, it's been perhaps the single most controversial issue that has been debated by this authority along with some other mediocre issues and no one here would not admit er to the fact that it has been opposed on such massive scale and even today we've had a further petition of three hundred and ninety five people opposing er this this this dreadful merger decision that was hanging over the er the the two centres and I'm pleased that er this this er amendment, this er er erm this petition was brought forward today because it does indicate the continuing support and opposition to er the the kind of things that we should be doing and and those that we shouldn't. Can I also say Chairman that there is now a possibility of implementing a semblance of a federated provision er which will take into account and recognise the very important needs of that particular area. Importantly as it's highlighted in the petition. The much valued community education services offered by the multi-cultural family orientated Highfields youth and community centre and the kind of development of services that could take place at the Moat, Moat centre. Now, we hear time and time again of the one million capital that was spent and yes and I do hope that the provisions that will now be made through a combined budget which Mr seems to think is half a million but I can assure you it is not half a million however, I do I can further reassure him that by the time the Highfields er and Moat management committee have gone through with this it will be half a million, there will be a proper budget provision as it should have been in the last five to six years. Unfortunately that hasn't been the case. Chairman, er I don't want to prolong the debate because as I've mentioned before there is indicated support from a number of people er but I'm grateful er to the Liberals in the fact that they feel that they are in a position to support this amendment. Much more importantly, not only does it preserve the integrity of the people of Highfields but I guess in many ways it preserves the integrity of both the parties concerned while moving and supporting this particular amendment. Can I say finally Chairman, that I will be instigating a er a request er I shall be requesting I should say perhaps to the director of education that erm the three party spokesman on the management committee and all those officers who will be involved in implementing this decision will get together at the earliest and I'm citing possibly next week so that we can be on our way to plan the next step forward to a concrete implementation of this particular proposal. That's how serious we are and although Mr er has to give his little laugh but I hope that he is just as much serious er particularly now that the political realities are that we will have a way forward, of not only supporting the delivery and management of community education services in that particular area but a clear focus has now been given, hopefully after this amendment er has been carried to the education authority. Thank you Chairman. Have we a seconder? Right Mr Chairman, I've listened with erm interest to Professor erm weasel words explaining that he didn't mean what he's been saying for the past three years and trying to explain away what he's effectively and he might as well admit it a complete volte face worse than that his agreement to an arrangement which he knows is second best. I also listened to Mr I didn't understand what he was saying but I did listen to him er the bit that I did er catch was his denial that erm the revenue budget for Moat and Highfields was half a million well he's quite correct because I've got the figures here. They're in fact five hundred and one thousand, one hundred and thirteen and if Mr is erred by one thousand one hundred and thirteen pounds I would hope he'd forgive him, the fact is that this year's budget for those two buildings er, is that amount. Er, er Mr might have added that er the village hall management committees which er he has a great affection would not be unhappy if they had the sum of five hundred and one thousand one hundred and thirteen pounds with which to provide sources, er resources for the communities that he represents. Chairman er in his remarks a bit earlier on Professor said that he did not think it was appropriate to give executive power to the director of education I wrote your words down at the time he did not think it appropriate to give executive power to the director of education and he said, despite Mr 's clarification you want to move a bit nearer if you're going to be his minder Mr that in fact he didn't that Liberals are incapable of sustaining er the same argument in committee, er sub-committee, main committee and council and I have to say er that erm er placing a bet with Ernie was taking money off children. And I'm I'm I I'm I'm delighted er I shall be encouraging them to pay up promptly. Now I do ask myself this this question erm I can recognise the argument that if you if you're not actually going to achieve your objectives you have to change your mind. I'm surprised that comes from er er Professor and his party who have for example campaigned membership Yeah. That membership consolidation is important, but with check-off and other payment methods and the issue of computer printed cards valid for two years, we feel that there are alternatives and better methods to investigate. in order to allow us to do that examination, I make a recommendation on such erm checking. Thank you. Thanks Colin. Does the Northern Region accept reference? Yes, Conference agree? Thanks very much. report Mick . I know but erm if I don't see I'm gonna crack. Ah. Right. organize you for doing that scan. Mhm. See what's going on. That's the results about ten minutes ago, an hour ago. Yeah. And that's clear as well.

Right cheerio now. My first memories of Walsall Airport were when Walsall Flying Club was in being before World War Two. If you look from towards , which was a large house in a clump of trees, at the far side was a pavilion which was the clubhouse, they used to hold air displays and pleasure flights, also they had commercial flights. I've seen them towing across the sky with Beecham's Pills written on them er it was a familiar sight in Walsall at the time, and also sometimes they had a plane sky-writing and they used to write Rinso in smoke in the sky. The club's planes were usually Tiger Moths in the main, and as I remember the main airport building adjacent to the main road, pre war, were building Swallow side-cars for motorbikes. Soon after the war started Helliwells Aircrafters, it was known, started an operation for the repair and rebuilding of aircraft for the RAF. The types which were Boston Fighter Bombers and Harvard Trainers, both were American planes. Peter was the test pilot used to be testing the Harvards over Walsall, and the engines used to make noises like angry wasps which was Walsall people became to know very well. I left school in 1942 and got a job at the airport, which at the times we were living in always something exciting seemed to be happening. Well I remember an Oxford aircraft over-flying the airfield and crashing in blocking the lane and going into the hedge on the other side, into Gingers Yard. Billingham Woolwork we used to get entertainment nearly every lunchtime in the canteen, sometimes it was a film or live acts, comics and singers and one of the workers named Haydon , formed a small band which he call Butch Blood and the Boston Bashers. Who did this entertainment, was it the workers themselves or did they ? No they used to have organized ENSA concerts and er such like and er, when the Americans started arriving in England in large numbers ready for D Day, the temporary placement depot at Lichfield was a dispersal unit for soldiers sent there. They sent their big band for a show and it was a really memorable sound as they had fellas on the way over to join Glen in Europe. An American army sergeant arrived at the airport one day who befriended me and he was in charge of an artillery spotting plane called the Piper Cub which they gave a small corner of the airfield to. He came in one afternoon and started painting black and white stripes round the fuselage and wings, when asked the reason for this he said it was a new allied marking. The next day both he and his plane were gone and with hundreds of planes going over, the next morning D Day had begun. Later in the year, two U S A Thunderbolt Fighters landed after a daylight sortie over France, they were painted in the usual drab green camouflage colour and both had a pink and red glamour girl on the side about twenty feet long, typical of the Yanks. One afternoon a flying fortress which had come off worse on the mission over Germany tried to land at Walsall, which was much too small to take an aircraft of this size, and the girl in the control box had to find, fire a warning vary light and radio to send him off to Castle Bromwich which was much bigger in those days er it was an airport to take an aircraft the size of the Flying Fortress that's about it up until here I've written Oh right. What was your job? What did you do? I was only a lad, I was er a messenger boy on the loading deck and I used to have to go down to at Beskett and fetch parts for the planes and er plates, aluminium plates, to be normalized which was a treatment when they put them into the vats and I had to fetch the films as well, from the house that used to be a warehouse for films over in er in by the beacon, great bar! Films what were those for, what ? They were for the entertainment of the workers in their lunch break er, it wasn't really much of a job but er, I kept applying to go onto the floor to actually work on the aircraft but they, they wouldn't sort of er, I was needed too much in the receiving departments so in the end I left. How would these damaged planes used to arrive at the airport? Did they come by road or ? Well some of them came by road and RAF trucks, the fuselages, and then there were all they started at the top of the airfield in the old flying club pavilion, and then they were er stripped down and stuff was taken off them, checked out, for airworthiness to see whether it was ready to go back on the planes, and then they came down to the back of the top hanger which was then they were all down to the skeleton of the aircraft and they started rebuilding them again like, there were engine shops and the place at the bottom hanger where they used to make the Swallow side-cars was the spraying and where they completed the aircraft. Can you tell me about the buildings that were around the airport? Yes Tell me what fronted the main road first. Yes the they were much the same as they are now but er, of course the one nearest was the er spraying hanger, that's where they used to build the Swallow side-cars, the main office building there's a large hanger with large sliding doors at the back of there which used to house the erm experimental department for the Harvard Aircraft and erm they used to operate the flight gang from there getting the planes ready to go up to be actually tested, and then the next hanger up was very much er starting from scratch and finishing the aircraft structurally you know. They had an in, an in and out shop of where they used to recondition the engines er and er I that's about all er. What sort of runway was it? There were, there was, there wasn't any runway it was just a grass airfield as there was a lot of them in those days erm this, this is why they, they couldn't get any aircraft of any size in there you see, this is why some of them used to overshoot if they got twin engines before the war erm About how many people were employed there would you say at this time? Oh hundreds I would think, all of three hundred people. Were men and women involved in this ? Oh yes oh yes working on the aircraft as well. Mm was that all they actually did during those war years there just repairing the aircraft That's right yes yes cos and putting them back into service? motorcycle side-cars were very much a luxury trade you see. It was totally devoted to war work. Erm they er as airfields had to be protected they build some pillboxes, country pillboxes for the Home Guard at strategic points I was going to ask you about security and also the Home Guard or the army were in the house at the far side of the airport which was called Aldridge Lodge they were very much in there the erm Where there ever any breaches of security? Oh no no, it was really a happy-go-lucky time you, you had to be alive in those days to appreciate it, it, people sort of got together and it, it's a different attitude to life today er much more friendly people there and they, we all worked together we all pulled together to defeat Hitler this, this was the thing in those days. Were women involved in the work there as well? Yes, yes, yes and What sort of things would they have done? Well they, they were er helping the electricians and er but they were er they weren't so technically involved as perhaps they would be today. They were very much sort of in an assistance capi capacity if you can understand. Erm how types of craftsmen were employed there to do things? Well there were electricians there were carpenters, the carpenters were into directly involved with building aircraft but they used to create the engines and make engine stands such things and do maintenance work around. There were engine fitters, electricians, riggers and er course there were sheet metal workers as well working in aluminium and pop rivets er there was er also a government inspection department and a works inspection department and er things and da the Air Ministry had to be very up to scratch you know erm Did they work through the night as well, was it shiftwork there? Not as I remember no funnily enough but they used to have people who, who went out to work at different airports after the planes had gone out they used to have gangs that went out to Perton and er we used to draw equipment from er the maintenance un RAF maintenance unit at Stafford things used to come from there. What did these gangs go out to Perton for, what was that all about? Well after the, the aircraft had actually er left the airport to go, be handed back to the RAF they said sometimes had to be serviced or final adjustments made and that's what they used to go out there for but erm Helliwells was ver it was still, all through the war it was Helliwells aircraft they used to have their own lorries and everything and they used to erm, be under the auspices of the Air Ministry but it was very much a private company. You mention test flights er Yes yes was there just one test pilot or Yeah well there was one main test pilot that's right and other people like, who used to be an instrument gang as well, well I do know this fella Cyril he was a dental mechanic in Walsall before the war and he came in there and he was an instrument mechanic and he used, he used to go up with the test pilot to actually test the instruments in the other compartments in the plane or cockpits just to see how they were reacting under operational conditions. He subsequently er went to work at the Berlick in latter years and, and this man was just sweeping-up at the Berlick and I couldn't believe it cos he was so high up in the technology in the war and he'd be a dental mechanic and he'd come down to just being a sweeper-up, and he used to show me the pay packets he'd got in the war and you know it was fantastic money even, even by today's standards this is going back fifteen years What did he used to earn and how did it compare with ? Well he showed me packets thirty five and forty pounds a week which then those days was utterly fantastic money. And what would an ordinary person have been earning at Helliwells? Well in the war five pounds a week was extraordinary money, cos they used to say a fella had got a good job if he was getting five pounds a week in those days, so that when I started work first I, I was getting fifteen shillings a week, so you can understand that seventy five pence today, at fourteen. I went to the Bluecoat School in Walsall and they erm they used to run a A T C wing in there which later to belonged to and they they brought this Hawker Demon in, which was a plane into the playground for the instruction of the A T C fellas and the kids all ripped the canvas off it for souvenirs and it was down to a skeleton in no time You mentioned that you used to have to go to Helliwells down at Beskett Beskett yeah yeah erm what was the set-up there? They, they used to build wings for the, they had er all pop riveters and they used to b build wings for the planes that finally came up to the airport down there and erm it was very much a structural set-up as I say I used to have to take plates down there from the airport to be normalized, it was er a sort of softening treatment for aluminium and made them easier to shape and rivet them onto the main fuselage, but they, they used to make Harvard wings and cowls, engine cowls, for the Bostons and Havocs they weren't the one type of Boston was a fighter bomber and another one it had the front navigator's position cut out and they used to have a search light put in there which they used to call Turbin lights and they were for use of coastal command of the RAF first searchlighting for submarines, looking for submarines, the er the Harvards were very much trained as some of them came in from the Navy they were used for training landing of pilots on aircraft carriers, and they had hooks underneath you know the er they were a very good trainer they were still used today, but when we used to go and see films at the pictures they used to use them a lot as Japanese aircraft because they looked alike, and they used to use them as zeros in the American films these Harvard trainers, er and but like as I said they had a experimental department at Helliwells and they used to try out various things to see if they could improve on the structure or the instrumentation things like that Were there any parts of er of the complex that were out of bounds sort of top secret work going on or anything like that? Well no not really because erm it, it was a private company as you can understand er, I can I can't really explain it everyone seemed to be pulling together you know that was the last thing you thought of, fifth columnists, things like that although it was they used to er, every now and again they used to send government national service officers round to look at the personnel and the structure of the working and if they thought anybody was superfluous to requirements they'd get the papers soon after to go into the army or the services yeah, yeah, that is true and that happened, used to happen in factories all round the area, it was called the Essential Works Order. Was there erm a canteen there or facilities for you? Yes, yes that's where they used to have the shows in the lunchtime they had very good er food arrangements and facilities. We used to go up there for our breaks as well morning and afternoon and they used to have dances sometimes in the evening. What was the food like? Cos it was sort of rationing at that time. That's right yes oh we used to get sausages with bread in it and potatoes mainly you know, greens and things like that were the staple diet but they, they used to get rations apart from people's personal rations being on war work if you can understand. So you were well looked after. Oh yes yes very much so. You mentioned er you had a friend that worked at the, the bomb dump at Lindley. That's right Can you tell me anything about that? It, well nothing really in depth but there was erm something else I was going to tell you. As I had to go to Beskett this young woman had not long been married and she always used to ask me to call at her house in Palfrey, cos I used to go on a bike not in a van, on a carrier bike, she used to ask me to call at her house in Palfrey to see if there were any mail from her husband and he was, there sometimes was sometimes there wasn't nothing you know that he'd written and er one day I'd got back and er she was all in tears and er he, he had been killed in France and I was glad I didn't have to be the harbinger of the times you know she still lives in Palfrey now Mrs yeah. This, this bomb dump it was a RAF place was it? Yes, yes, yeah, but they did have civilians working there but I don't know where they used to ferry the bombs out to but I do believe they used to carry detonators and everything down there you know. They were just stored in the caverns That's right yeah, yeah, yeah but er cos I remember the caverns from before the war when I was in the Cubs. I was in the central Cubs and we used to go up there to lime pits and round Lingley Woods you know on days out tracking and all that sort of thing. Did you ever go down the caverns? No, no I've never been down and er they've always been full of water whenever I've been up around there. Did they have problems with keeping the water out during the time they were storing the Well as I understand they must have had pumps down there or something to or something to keep them dry because er Were you in any sort of A R P unit or anything like that during the war years? Er I, I was a messenger for a time for the er, we lived in Lane and I was a messenger for a time with the erm A R P headquarters in Drive, now when my uncle got married and he had two children and I'd, they were issuing gas masks and I had to go down and fetch a gas mask for his daughter and they were great big ones that used to envelope the whole babies with a bellows on the side that the mothers used to have to pump when they were in them, thank goodness we never had to use them and erm What sort of a set-up was it in Lane the A R P? Oh Drive Drive, sorry. Well it was a large double-fronted house and it was sand-bagged all round and there were tables and to er, administer, you know, wardens in the unevent of air raids which they used to do and they used to patrol the streets looking for lights to see if pe my nan actually got fined once cos she, she event inadvertently went into a room and put the light on and forgot she'd left the curtains open and an air raid warden happened to be around she, she got hauled into court and fined five pounds for that, er she er I, I once I was just thinking the other day just telling a friend of mine, they had an actual practice air raid once and in some old buildings in the Burchells and we as kids had to go and lie in there and wait till we'd got a tag on and what would happen to us a label and they took us to the first aid post in, an ambulance came and picked us up on a stretcher and took us to the first aid post in Road. We used to have dress rehearsal, some, I think I got mustard gas burns as well I was supposed to have on my arm er Did this er, going back to Helliwells again, repairing of the aircraft, did that cease when the war finished or did it continue for a time afterwards? It, it, it just went on for a lit a short time afterwards but er, but when the war ended course things, some things changed pretty rapidly as you can appreciate but, but by this time I, I was working for Ellwells then on long distance transport and we used to have to go and fetch tractors or bulldozers that had got armour plating on from Dagenham docks and bring them up here and start selling them to civic contractors and the, the Americans were selling a lot of equipment as well at end of the war, and I saw money made overnight like, people were buying the lorries and putting them on the road you know for work and transport firms and all that and they were getting some of them for next to nothing So Helliwells were involved in this? Not really no, I was working for another firm by this time. We, I used to move around a lot on those days as you could do really speaking because I wasn't old enough to be under the Essential Works Order you see, and er I was by the time I went into the army it was 1946 so er the war was over. Yeah tell me the sequence of your jobs then, you started off you were a messenger at Helliwells and then what did you do? Helliwells yeah Yes then what did you do after that? Well I went to, erm they wouldn't let me go to work on the aircraft so I left and I went to work and the Walsall Electric Company, it was within Walsall and I was there when V E day happened and er a pal of mine said he knew where I could get this job and oh it was travelling about which I enjoyed and er I, I went then to work for Elwells I was there until I went in the army, but they were very much heavy transport and in those days the opencast mining started happening as well and we were taking diggers about bulldozers and tractors, scrapers for the opencast mining and I remember, in the bad winter of forty-seven, they, they took up a big part of Park, trees and everything and they never found a bit of coal and yet when started levelling off at Darleston, for Bentley Garden Village as it was then called, er they were getting coal out and people were going up with prams, barrows and everything and fetching it all out it was only being levelled for building work, and fetching coal, natural coal off Bentley Common the erm I've wandering off away from the airport a bit haven't I? Tell me about V E day. Yes, I was working at Walsall airport er Walsall electrics, sorry, at the time and er I've been out to the pictures I, with a couple of friends and er I got home this particular evening and I put the late night dance music on on the radio and they, they interrupted the programme to tell us that er Germany had accepted unconditional surrender and the war was over. Well, my gran had told me that she'd gone down to see her friends who'd get the Brown Lion after them by this time and er I decided to go down and tell them as I could see if they hadn't got the radio on they wouldn't have known so as I walked from Burchells down Road I could see doors throwing open lights were coming on, people were coming out in the street and dancing and I got round down to the Brown Lion and it was all in darkness, and I rang the bell on the side door and I heard a few bumps and bangs and Mr who'd kept it then came to the door, and I said do you know the war's over and er he said oh no come on in that's w now his son was a prisoner of war and they had been, he'd continually tried to escape so much that he had his photograph taken in the Sunday paper, the, the Germans had had kept chaining him to the wall and other prisoners, other soldiers had got these photographs of him and smuggled them out and got them back to England, to the nearest papers, and er he he'd said to my nan cos he knew she'd always worked behind the bar, he said will you serve if I open the pub now, which was about eleven o'clock at night and she said yes of course, and the they opened the Brown Lion at about eleven o'clock at night in next to no time the place was full of people drinking, celebrating and of course the next day was really it. I remember going down to the bridge in Walsall and a sailor climbed the old clock and tied his collar around it and a soldier got up and put his hat on and an airman got up and put his tie with a red, white and blue rosette on it, around the arms of the old clock and people were loving and kissing everywhere, and oh it was really you had to be alive to appreciate it. After, after the years of hardship and loss and then ev everything came as a relief, course we were still at war with the Japanese and people were still in Burma, our soldiers were still in Burma fighting the Japanese, but having said that the main issue was over and it wasn't long after the Americans dropped the atomic bomb and of course, I always thought they had to really or else the Japanese would still be fighting now the er they had special dances in the Town Hall for the V E Day and the Americans who did a a jitterbug contest and er I always remember my friend and his sister, who was English, they actually won it against the Yanks he er Did the Americans have a lot to do with Walsall ? Oh yes, yes, they even had like they used to have savings' weeks er salute the soldier week, they used to have promotions for National Savings you see and we used to get so much money or where they had a bid thermometer on the car park in Street which is now the extension of the Gala Baths and they used to show how much savings had been put in they used to have targets for people, to put the National Savings in, they used to have an Anglo-American friendship week. What was that exactly? Well they used to ask you to invite the e actually invite the American soldiers into your homes and my friend in Chuckery a couple of years ago, I was visiting him one Sunday lunch and a knock came to his door and he went and it was a guy who came over to see, his mum is now dead, but he, he come over he remembered him from the war. He was stationed in an old chapel in Chuckery because the Americans once they'd started they were putting them everywhere or anywhere they could just get to be with them before V Day they were even in little chapels, churches, outhouses anywhere they could possibly and there were guns and bits of trucks on every spot of land where they could get them the er, I'm getting out of context I was just thinking about a tank, a First World War tank that they used to have those as well in the field gun in the er arboretum which were disappeared soon after the war they went for scrap and they came and they used, people used to have a lot of wrought iron railings as well they took those as well they came along with burners and went off to the war effort, but er like I say the Americans and of course as kids they were very generous with kids and we absolutely loved them. They used to give us gum and sweets everything and the, they sometimes, the military police they used to come down town and they'd be after deserters from Lichfield and Is that where the Americans were stationed? That's right the tenth replacement depot in Lichfield and they used to come round to Walsall looking for absentees and deserters and they there was actually a shooting match in Street the MPs started firing the guns at these fellas who'd gone absent without leave, and, but as I understand I remember at the time there was a lot of racism in America then and they, they picked these coloured fellas up and apparently the C O at Lichfield was very much a southern colonel and he was a racist and they used to chain these coloured guys up behind the trucks and make them walk all the way back to Lichfield behind the trucks driving the trucks at walking pace and I understand there was a, a salver, a commemorative salver in the Town Hall to be presented to him, and some an MP in the Council he were looking for this colonel, but as I understand he was court-martialled after the war for racism and so I don't think he'd be wanting, wanted to be connected with Walsall any more, so but this was What was his name do you remember it? Colonel with a K the this band, they used to, that they had from the tenth replacement depot used to come down and play at the Town Hall, and they they like I said before they were fellas on the way to join Glen the absolute ultimate musicians of America and it was why I'm still today erm I've got a big collection of jazz records and have always been interested in the big band sound. It must have been quite exciting to hear them. Oh yes it was, very much so. They were brilliant times to live in he then me uncle Ed come on leave, from France, yeah I had a look at his rifle he used to bring all his equipment cos they didn't know if the units had moved when they got back and if they used to be lucky enough to get a leave, they used to have to bring all their equipment with them you see and he used to bring his rifle, everything on leave, and I, I always remember asking him why he hadn't, if he'd killed any Germans, why he hadn't got any notches on his rifle he erm Do you rec turning back to Helliwells again jumping about a bit Yes erm when did they stop doing work on aircraft there, do you recall about what year that would be? I can't, I can't remember precisely even so I think it, it, it's Walsall's loss that they haven't got an airport any more, it, it's purely but erm they, they did have a lot of s divided up into a lot of sports fields at one time didn't they but the people who've, is it the M E B who control those buildings now? I don't know it was TI wasn't it at one time. That that's right yes it was yeah and the airfield was divided up into football pitches and such like but er Did it continue as a sort of civilian airfield after the war? Oh no, no, no, not at all af after the war work it, it just seemed to er no one ever seemed to get any be interested in flying as they were pre-war then, or they probably that they had cars and they could get about more you know to other outlying places like Pentiford in Wolverhampton So that flying club that you mentioned earlier on just finished ? Oh yes when the war started yes, you, you see the people would have been called up into the forces anyway people young enough to fly, who, who had an interest, because er one of the air displays I remember very much a tomboy as she was she they used to give pleasure flights and she had defied this pilot to take her up and make her sick, and he was took her up there looping rolling and everything and er Do you recall the incident when Henry crashed there? No, not precisely I, I was a bit too young then, I, I remember all the songs about her Amy wonderful Amy and all those and oh and when she married Jim I was very much in but I couldn't actually say I remembered her crashing at Walsall The erm you could, yeah, when I came home from work one Monday afternoon my nan said this eighty eight had gone over very low, and we, we heard that they'd dropped this landmine this same aircraft had dropped this landmine that had gone under the gas holder at the gas works, in Road and the, they had some rescue workers from the A R P to get it out they never even bothered calling for the Royal Engineers, but the situation was that landmines used to come down on parachutes, and they used to slide into places which were inaccessible but anyway, they relied on the local Walsall A R P to get them out. The other time I remember was when William the chromium platers in Street ye got bombed, with a high explosive bomb, but there was, there was no one hurt that I remember, and then the Halleys the tent people had an incendiary bombs and got burnt out, at the same night that they dropped some incendiary bombs on the bus depot in Road, they, they were a lot of work for the fire brigade, but comparatively speaking with, with Birmingham I think Walsall got off very lightly as regards the bombing, as there was no heavy industry around here. I do believe there were, there was a high explosive bomb but I think it was just jettisoned to as you wanted to get back home the German pilot he, he landed somewhere up Bluebell Wood but it just exploded and no one was hurt. Where was that Bluebell Wood? At, at the back of the Three Crowns where that is now, I don't know whether if it was a bomb meant for the airport, I can't think that it was though it was a bit far away for that. Did they have any erm raids that were that you'd think were directed towards the airport at all, were there any incidents of this kind? No, no it was very much a green field area, and I think if they'd have wanted to get bomb anywhere they'd have been directed at Castle Bromwich, which were very much they were building Lancasters and Sterlings and they were very much the heart of the British bomber industry. We were only small fry really at Walsall airport. About how many erm planes would they have in during the week to repair, what was the, the turnover? Oh it, it wasn't there seemed to be a long time you know before they turned one out to make, because it was a very long process rebuilding an aircraft,es especially as the situation was at Walsall. I, I think it was only a drop in the ocean really towards the national effort, but, but I remember erm at Darlaston, they used to build tanks over there and they, they used to pay us visits in sometimes they'd send some of their men over in the tanks to give us a pep talk about the war effort and all that but er, they used to do things like that then to gee you up erm How many aircraft were they capable of working on at the same time? Oh they, they used to have several going through the hangers at one time they erm they probably had about six Harvards, and about nine Bostons which were, they were bigger than Blenning Bombers, er were these Bostons and Harvards they er quite a twin engine quite a wide wingspan and quite heavy for what they were, but as they were stripped down in, in the top hanger, and like I say a lot of stuff was salvaged from them, which was still good as they went out reconditioned at the other end. There were sometimes they, they came, if they'd been in action and er, the people had actually found blood and parts of the uniforms in the air gunner's compartment at the back, and the, the fella, the navigator u and bomb aimer used to be in the nose, they hadn't got much of a chance if they came down in there because they were right cut off from the rest of the aircraft so, but it was virtually a suicide position in the nose of the Bostons. They yeah we used to call in Tex and he, he couldn't believe that there were old people living in Walsall at the time in this country the size of England, and people living in Walsall that had never seen the sea in their lives, and this guy coming from America couldn't believe this. He, he was a real friendly guy and like I say he never said cheerio before he went, but one day he just painted his aircraft up with the D-day landing signs which we didn't know at the time and the next day he was gone of course it was very much top secret that was but the town just emptied of all Americans it was like a ghost town after them but it had been previously. It was like walking into Chicago at times in Walsall and the snowdrops as they used to call their military police with the white steel helmets on they used to ride around in jeeps. I first started to go when they were getting promotion to the second division the last few matches in the third division. When was that about, what year would that be? That would be about sixty, sixty one as I see, and er they were the last match of the season virtually was that they gained promotion on was Shrewsbury, which was at the game meadow and Arthur , the player manager who was a prolific goal scorer in his day, was playing at the time and er nobody expected Walsall to win but they ran out two-one winners and all down the A five that night all the pubs were full coming back with everyone celebrating, so erm, after then they had a civic dinner at the Town Hall for the players and they did a big flower display in the arboretum all set out in flowers the club badge and congratulation lads on winning promotion, and this when they kicked off the following season, in the second division, prior to that they played a friendly match against Leicester and Gordon was in goal and I took my boy with me Tim, who was only a toddler at the time, and he, I stood him on the old archway where the players used to run out, but the first league match was against Sunderland and Brian , actually played for Sunderland as centre forward and er Walsall ran out four-three winners in the end Tony , who was Walsall inside left got a hat trick and I believe Tommy , got the other goal and Brian scored for Sunderland, then the er we went on to the, the first away match which was at Derby County, and Walsall won that three-one. I think it was the impetus of them getting promoted and the enthusiasm the er then the next home match was against Newcastle which Walsall played to a packed house. There were twenty five thousand, I, I wouldn't like to see twenty five thousand on that ground again, because I, I used to smoke at the time and we were packed that tight in the ground I couldn't even get my hands down to my pockets to get a cigarette out, so the erm after the first few games they started to draw at home and then they seemed to lose the impetus and that they still held a good position in the league, but the following season Liverpool were in the second division at the time, and I, I went to that match and Walsall scored first through Colin and er, they went on to beat us six-one in the end. Can't tell you how long a journey it was back in the fog from Liverpool that day, and then when we were relegated back again to the third division it was on the last match of the season against Charlton, and the heavens opened and a big thunder storm and it just flooded the pitch and the referee just called the match off and they had to play it again the following Friday and Charlton ran out two-one winners and Walsall finished with nine fit men and still that's the football I suppose. Can you tell me something about the crowd itself, erm did particular age groups tend to stand together around the ground or were the young Oh oh oh not really, but it was when this chanting came in that the young fellas seemed to like gangs in the crowd and this when all the trouble started When would that have been about this were they in the second division then or Oh no no it would be ten fifteen years ago I think. The erm, yes these and it started to be like warfare more than a game you know at that stage but hopefully now we're getting back to some sort of sanity with the membership cards you know, because we, the crowd is segregated from the away supporters now and that's cos if Walsall go into the second division again they'll have to spend so much I believe on the ground to cage the away supporters in which they don't have to do in the third division. I was just discussing this last night, but they used to be more friendly atmospheres, even with the away supporters years ago you know it was but things go full circle in the end and hopefully like I say we're getting back to some sort of sanity now. Have you ever felt personally unsafe in the crowd? O only that night against Newcastle when they were, they were packed tight you know. It was just I, I went down they played Liverpool in the cup about that era, and the, the wall was pushed down at the Street end but erm the people just spilled on the pitch and I don't think anyone was really hurt, this happened when they played er Liverpool in the cup a couple of years ago the wall was pushed down at the other end on that occasion, but er there was just one, one person hurt but there wasn't anybody very seriously injured as I understand Were there any, were there any special chants or songs that the Walsall crowd used to put across Well, well they did try to get a song going once sponsored by the club, it was sung by St Matthews' choir would you believe, but it, it didn't seem to take off, the football supporters seemed to take very much to their own sort of songs, and they, they'd pick up songs and chants from other grounds now like the Liverpool song You'll Never Walk Alone, and they used to sing Away the Lads they used to pick that up from the Newcastle supporters and and Was there anything that was specifically Walsall chants Not that I can recall no the erm Were there any players that the crowds used to pick on especially in any way? No but Urging them on or putting them down. Well Tony , was who manager at the associated now, er he was very a very popular player, he was a goal scorer on one occasion, they played an away match at Swindon and he scored a goal and the goalkeeper got sent off a John so Tony went in goal and he saved a penalty later in the match, but he was a very popular player he was a a good goal scorer then there was Colin he, he had one of the hardest shots in the league you know, I've, I've seen the goalkeeper shrug his shoulders at, at defenders and say well how do you stop those, they used to call him Cannonball at one time, and er there was Tommy he had his collarbone broken and he never played again after, but he was a great centre forward he used to make a lot of space for the other forwards you know. Course when Walsall were promoted, they hadn't got into the European systems then it was very much the old five forwards three halfbacks two fullbacks and a goalkeeper in those days, the, the laundry was there, in those days when they were in the second division. That was laundry? That's right yes and they used to say that the stack was full of footballs been put up there by p opposing defenders. When the, the laundry was knocked down it seemed to be the end of an era that er, it didn't seem to be like park much longer. When did they knock that down? Oh, it was, that would be the late sixties I would think when they were in the erm third division. And how did they use that extra area, what did they do with the ? Well that that is now accommodation for away supporters down at there is no cover over it as yet, there were plans to make a covered stand of it but er they haven't it has been covered over and that's where the away supporters still stand to this day and a little bit around the corner at the bottom end, at the railway end as they call it now, not the laundry end. What about the Hilary Street end is that still open ? That, that's open to the general public but where I stand you have to have a membership card to go in there now, and er you pay two pound before the season started and er local traders give you a discount and things erm it's just one way of er segregating the supporters if you like, but there doesn't seem to be so much trouble since they've done this, but at the same time there doesn't seem to be as much atmosphere How do you mean in there. atmosphere, what's gone? Well all the support comes from one side of the ground, I mean when they score all the shouting comes from one side of the ground now and when Walsall scored all the shouting seems to come from the Street end and the erm So before it was erm all the way around the pitch, the response. That's right, yes, yes. What about away matches? Do they get much following from their supporters? Oh yes quite so and if they're doing well they really, local people really get behind them, but they, they've prom in previous seasons they they've promised so much and then fell away at the end that people have got a bit disillusioned and discontented so that, but like last year when they were doing well in the cup they erm at Watford I mean loads of people went to see them. My son and daughter-in-law went down. They made a four all draw and I think they've still got the video now on television of the match. How do most people go to away matches? Do they make their own way ? Their own transport and they do, do run coaches and er there are rail British Rail run the service as well as a rule. I don't think they've had a lot of trouble really speaking with Walsall supporters over the years because they seem to be er go to support the club not to fight and er What about home erm away teams coming to Walsall I mean is there ever any trouble as they arrive in the town? Well not any more. The last trouble I remember was when they played Birmingham City in the Cup last season. They reckon arrests were made down but they were down at Beskett Station and they made a couple inside the ground, but I think they were just people running on the pitch you know, they were over enthusiastic. Has there ever been any trouble down in the Pleck itself on match days? Well I, I As in pubs I have seen away supporters being chased up the road into Pleck Park and but erm I think basically a lot of the trouble used to be caused by drink and now they don't have any drink in the ground they er they, they seem to have cracked that one. Were there any teams that used to come and play at Walsall that were notorious in any way? Oh oh yes very much so they were Millwall and erm there were notably Millwall. Why, I mean what was the problem with them? Well they were noted even when cos Jim went down there a few, few times he used to have chaps running around the ground with chains and knives and all that sort of thing, but it's in the Dockland area of London Millwall. They used to be a real rough lot as I believe they are still now they've still got a name today they What about Port Vale I've heard people say they used to be a hard team to play. Yes but they never seem to have got a lot down at Walsall. To Tony was telling me that er he was asked that Walsall needed the money so he was asked to be transferred to Port Vale, which he did but er I think he was past his best and he, he'd came down back here and played a couple of times with Port Vale, and er but erm like I say he was past his best. He was a, got a record number of goals for Walsall in the season, it's never been broken to this day erm. Colin broke, I think he equalled a record for a leftwinger as well scoring goals we had er later on we had Bob came from Coventry, Coventry City. He played in goal for several years for Walsall. Where did people park their cars and all that when they go to the matches ? Round in Crescent and er the people make allowances often they make announcements in the ground of they're blocking somebody's entrance and will they go and move the cars out and I recall many years ago a lot of people used to go on bicycles and they used to leave them in the front of those houses that are just in . That, that's right yeah . The, the people used to charge them so much haven't they for parking the cycles yes. I, I used to walk it there when I went there,e even from Lane I never used to get on the bus I, I used to walk it down there cos we used to go down by the side of, of the old Street cemetery you know over by the gas works and up Street the erm What about the directors and managers? Oh oh yes Henry who was the chairman of the day then. When was that? In now I was reading about him pretty recently Never mind. Oh I, I can't put the year Just approximately was this in the nineteen sixties? Yeah, yeah, yeah and then erm the family took over. The ? The took over yes then and they would And what influence did they have on the Walsall Football Club? Well they, they seemed to be putting some finance in, but er it went through a bit of a flat spot and then the sold out I, I'm sorry I'm stuttering and all this but I haven't done my research you know and it, it's, it's tough going. Er . What sort of influence did the directors and managers have with choosing the team? Well the Bill was, who was the manager in those days was very much the manager, and there was one of the directors used to play for the Villa, and he used to more or less look after the playing side which the rest of the directors never seemed to interfere with, they, they left the management up to the manager the selection of the team, Bill and the trainer when they were in the second division was Arthur who's manager of Derby County now, he had the, I believe he had a sad time when he was at Walsall he, he lost his wife in a car accident and What about the ground itself? Was it a good ground to play on? Well they, they had to do the, it hadn't used to have very good drainage and far more of a slope, it, it's far more level today than it used to be, it used to have a great slope towards the long end which was considered an advantage to Walsall and the water used to gather, but I believe the improved the drainage and had pipes put under which it, it doesn't seem to gather water so much now down at the railway end. The since Terry took over the ground everything's been refurbished and new crush rails put up you know, and he seems to have made it a good ground. Quite, quite frankly I, I can't see Walsall moving, because it seems to have been money wasted if they've made Fellas Park good and then they move somewhere else. So I wouldn't like to see any property developers take it, the club on because I think they'd be purely after the ground, I, I'd feel much better if the consortium with Ray at the head took it over because they are genuinely interested in Walsall and the Walsall people. You said earlier that you go to reserve matches as well. I, I did do years gone by yes and they, they did move into the football combination at one time, because it was considered that the Midland Intermediate League was too big a jump for young men into the first team and the difference was so vast in the type of football that Walsall second team they u only playing young fellas, and they used to win seven and eight goal margins every week you know, but then they moved up into combination that was a better standard of football, but latter years economy drives and everything they came back out of the combination reverted to the Midland Intermediate again which I believe there are two phases of that no one for s older players and the other one strictly for youth players I was going to ask you if they'd got a youth team? Yes, yes, they're out of the youth cup now as I understand. I, I can't remember who knocked them out but erm they are out of that competition. Is the ground ever used for anything else apart from? No, no, it, it got oh er erm for other some local teams if have a final it's sometimes played down there. What sort of teams? In, in the days would they be? Of the er regime I saw erm Moscow, Moscow Dynamo came over and played Walsall in a friendly match yes erm Was there a good crowd for that one? Oh yes very good. There was about ten to fifteen thousand, which the limit on the, the ground limit today is about seventeen to eighteen as I can understand. And is it the same size ground as the match when there was twenty five thousand in you say you were a bit bothered about it in fact? Virtually but the laundry was there then there, there wasn't so much room then you see. Because of all those extra people in there? Because there was no one at the bottom end, but they've, they've got all those extra people in it, June to December but that's Yeah Just easier you see, cos he'll say the then for when we do a price increase next time. Cos if you go back up in September, it's higher for the increase next January. Well that's exactly right. . But but at Yeah okay but at least we've got the price on the table. Maybe we don't increase it next January. Mm. Maybe we leave it where it is, but at least that price is on the table. Right. Whereas anything else we do, we've got to fight ou we've got to claw our way back to that . I'll tell you what then, we've got the two options,we've got the one area of this five per cent where Yeah. we don't want to give em it for the whole year. Yeah. And I've got the standard cost here I need to get up. Right. Right, now erm I want to get that up first. Yeah. I want to make profit on one size rather than er Yeah. Yeah, keep it on others. Yeah. So how about if I look at the six monthly saving, Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I look at what that is in value, about two and a half thousand, I'll look at this one, Yeah. I'll put a reasonable price in there, I see what that's gonn I haven't managed to escape there, I'm glad just to get on the pitch. Now erm, I haven't been to a match lately, but these pictures I've seen, there's still all these fences around to stop people doing that. Erm, what is the situation in our own stadiums? Well we don't have fences,but erm, we are the regulatory authority but the County Council are the regulatory authority for the sports venues. The Fire Service have the delegated authority for them and the situation in our local sports events is quite adequate. There's work that needs to be done, in most of the major sports grounds, but that's proceeding and there's, if you can imagine that there's, in Shrewsbury for example, a lot of the work which we would want to be done on the grounds have been less than enthusiastic about doing, because they're likely not to be there for very long. But, and I have no concerns about sports ground sale, we've regulated the numbers because they had some concerns about the and that, that itself has caused 's fellow supporters some problems, but we've actually restricted the number of people who can use the sports ground. Right, so they're game heavy you think? I wonder if it's free to them Only people that the gate can know the christian names of are allowed in. I have here a comments that there wasn't any point in really restricting the numbers. I think they'd have three now as well as David. Councillor ? I'll, I was just going to say, Chairman, I, I too am very concerned really about the number of premises where it is advisory to the District Councils, or advisory to . Bearing in mind the number of private nursing homes that spring up and erm, er, I mean the sort of privately run places er, presumably the local authorities have to give them a licence to run, but is there no way that it, can the Fire Service, can our officers go and make an inspection? Clearly they have no power to do so, even if somebody asks them to, somebody from outside for instance, erm, and, and also when they do get a fire certificate, is there a display for it? Or stuck in the back of an office, or, or could they have something sort of glossy like the half kingdom Tourist Board stars, that they can put on their windows,to let people know that at least that particular nursing home or whatever establishment it is, has been duly inspected by our Fire Services? I mean, otherwise one assumes simply that people don't know. Mm, well th the answer to the first question is that, no we don't have any authority to enter premises like that, where we haven't been invited unless somebody has identified a potentially dangerous condition. Section ten of the Fire Precautions Act gives me the power to inspect any premises where we believe there is a threat to life, other than domestic premises. And there are certain circumstances in which we can do that. It also gives me the power to prohibit or restrict the use of those premises until those conditions are alleviated. In that document, there is a very strong reference to the fact that that power should be either restrictive or removed and that there should be a right of appeal against it, which would effectively prevent us from using it. In terms of nursing homes, we don't issue fire certificates anyway, we only issue certificates to offices, shops, building premises because they were under the Act, Hotels and Factories. So a nursing home, hospital and school, residential or otherwise, is never certificated, and any advice that we give is exactly that. It's not mandatory. That surely is is, is of quite concern to people in some way registering whether a place is considered safe or not. It's through Social Services or the Area Health Authority. That is there responsibility? To keep the place from the Fire Authority as from others. Yes, mm Yes, but they've got to have a, you, you've got to have a, you've got Leaving, leaving, leaving aside their er,ob sorry Chairman. Yes, I'll come back to you, sorry. just mention what I've heard, the only statutory job he could do, is apply his licence in . Is the Fire Officer given every individual case where they apply for a licence over an old people's home, and er, this sort of thing? Oh yes. And can't you keep it, keep the Fire Officer when the home's licence er, if they don't carry out statutory duties as required? We, we, we, I suppose it'd be like two levels, that in the majority of cases we could say we recommend that you do not issue a licence. Social Services are really a help, we could choose to ignore that, I have to say that I'm not aware of that happening, and I think it's very unlikely. Because it would be a very dangerous thing for someone to do. The other element is that the county's are so dangerous, and that's actually quite unusual, they're so dangerous that we consider they present a risk and it has to be me that considers it presents a risk to life, and I can either restrict the use of premises, but I can prohibit the use entirely. But as I say, this says that,an that's a relatively new and certainly draconian power, and it's recommended in this document that it's removed. Please Yes Colonel Is this, all these wonderful protection of animals, dogs and horses and so on, and pet shops and so on , do, does the Chief Fire Officer think in his local knowledge, that most of these have been inspected by his officers, or does he get the feeling there, that sometimes the district councils are not asking for these inspections? It varies a great deal depending on the district council. What I have to say really, is that most of those premises present very little risk at all, and, and I think that any change in the implementation of fire safety legislation should be based in prioritization. Now that's something that's difficult for us to do, because the more dangerous, the more erm, the premises should present the greatest life risk, are not necessarily the ones over which we have strict legislative control. I mean for example hospitals and nursing homes, we have a purely tenuous control over, whereas we have a very rigid control over a signal box on a railway. Now a signal box on a railway presents a fairly limited risk to life and a nursing home presents a fairly dramatic risk. Yes Jim, or Chairman, if, if someone doesn't come under the regulations and is operating a business or something of that sort,is there the facility for that body, either the management body or the business to ask voluntarily for you to inspect, with a view to issue a, er, erm, a certificate er, erm of er, safety? There's no If anybody wants a fire certificate and we had a recent case where a notable local solicitor asked us to issue a fire certificate and we refused, because his premises does not require one, or did not at that point require a fire certificate. Then he subsequently moved one person from the ground floor onto the first floor, which meant that he did require a fire certificate. But if it's not required by law, then I cannot issue, and if people ask for advice we are obliged under Fire Services, the Fire Services Act to give that advice, but what I'm really saying is that with the, the pressure of work on the Fire Safety Department, it's likely that if it's a fairly low risk to life, we'll never get round to it, and that's the honest truth. That's on your statutory requirement? Yes So what you're saying is, that if people er, if people's consciences state I ought to try and do this, but I'm not required by statute to do, the chances is that A, that you, you can't do it anyway, but B you wouldn't have the facilities to do it anyway, as well. We, we, we will normally get round to people. We do inspect . But we probably don't inspect and give advice to people who'd like us to, because they're not a priority, and we don't have the resources to do that. A lot of interesting points come out there, haven't they? Cap If, if, if I could summarize, if you could bear with me by saying that, there is no embracing legislation which covers fire safety, and there is no legislation which actually prioritizes it. What we have is picking up a ragbag of stable door legislation, that came out of other Acts, and that's why we have offices, shops and railway premises from the Oswald Acts which were neatly tucked in the back of Oswald's Act. Hotels which were in the first days of making order, and factories which came from the old Factories Act. And the cost, or the potential cost of designating particular, like hospitals and similar premises is so prohibitive that the government has chosen never to implement the designating orders for them. And I hasten to say it, governments of all persuasions assume it must be being done. Someone move the recommendation? I will Yes Five point seven, paper J, Fire and Rescue Service Training. Different board is the outcome of the P A G inspection? Yes, it seems it I don't know, Mr Chairman, I think you've always been very keen on this trend and supported it fully. And, I, I will support this number seven, seven with recommendations. Thank you there We are moving on reasonably well on this issue. Yes, well we've got to Reasonably well, yes, reasonably well Then I hesitate to say that there's probably a more complex issue now even than the Fire Station, erm,the figures which are given incidentally are the original estimate there, because that was what was available to us at the time. They have now been varied slightly but they make very little difference. A question that's already been asked of me, on appendix C, up at employee at the largest single figure there is a hundred and thirty seven thousand eight hundred. That's not a way of fudging some other cost, the retained fire fighters are recompensed when we provide training for them, because they normally have to lose work or whatever. They are very, very expensive to train because of that. We train whole-time fire fighters cheaply, but we pay the retained people compensation for loss of earnings. That figure is the majority, the majority of that figure is compensation for loss of earnings. That's the trouble, you get cheap service from retained personnel, but they're incredibly expensive to train. But absolutely essential. That's the only time you pay loss of earnings? Yes If they've taken off for a fire two days or something? They're going to get paid then. We pay them for attending fires. The only other time they're paid compensation for loss of earnings, is when they're sick as a result of an injury received on duty, you know Fire Brigade duty. Well this recommendation's been moved, seconded? Yes Five point eight, Emergency Planning Are you going to speak on it or not? The recommendation's here. Chair, here. We move There is one thing, and I think I did take it with you, erm, Mr Chairman, I'm with the erm, I've forgotten what the question on, corporational liberties, the thing that is concentrating many of our minds quite some , but the er, would, would the Chief Fire Officer like to? Yes, well he s he did take it up with me as a, er, I mean you did take it up I didn't complain, I didn't complain, I suggested it. No, but what, what I'm, what I mean, what I said such as emergency services. Now the emergency services are police, fire, and erm, and ambulance. There's a fourth one actually, but everyone knows who they are So those do cover the police. I mean, if the police and the ambulance service. Could, could that just be underlined perhaps in, by rephrasing it slightly to emphasise that, because I, I think that I think we all know what emergency services are We, we know but You don't, I see we, we do, but there's no harm, in view of our knowledge and experiences just to put that phraseology in a little bit bolder. I, I, I, I think Mr Chairman what I, I think I explained to you what my concern was, that we have cases where there's a serious road accident, and erm, and the road is stopped, we have no real authority to turn traffic or divert traffic, but the, the police are the only ones that can, and if we want to get down in, in, into an emergency very quickly. I, I mean it's only by the good will of the police that we can get down there and that,, this is, this is my concern Mr Chairman, in, in theory what I would like, if there was a serious emergency, you'd get a senior officer in here straight away, and I mean he would negate to the police, we have no authority over them, only cooperate with the police. And that's my concern. Well I, I I, I, I mean they're, you, you, I mean they're very good, but they do, er a lot are imperfect, a law unto. Oh, oh, I think all it wants is that paragraph rephrasing and with more strongly emphasis but, on the lines on with that. That's all I think Chairman, I don't suppose that er, you'll disagree with that will you? Well I, I wouldn't disagree with it, but I, but I, the description is perfectly plain to ensure that effective arrangements are established from liaison between the various departments of the County Council and the appropriate organizations such as the emergency services . I know what the emergency service is, I'm sure everybody else does. There's a fourth one that keeps cropping up on television but I mean we don't take that into consideration. But it's just police, fire and ambulance services, those are the emergency services, I can't see what, what the objection is to me making the paragraph stronger. No and I can't see wh no well I, we made it, I'm not against making it stronger, but I can't understand why this suggestion has been made. Well because of past experiences, Chairman, that's all. Let's make it strong I'm not criticising anybody, just make it stronger. Chairman, I, I, I'm really confused now, I mean they've, they've got me, they've got me talking about semantics here which is ridiculous. What we're talking about is the emergency services that sh that responds to the needs of those who are in difficulty or in distress. That's what we're doing and I can't see anything here that prevents er, total cooperation between A the police, B the ambulance service and C the fire services. I agree with you entirely. I think this is er, semantics, and simple nitpicking. The police have never, I mean the Fire Officer will tell me, has there ever been an occasion when the police have not cooperated with the Fire Service in an emergency situation? No No, no there's always room for improvement in liaison Come on we're talking about the job, the job description, really they're there to please, er, er, this is written by one, one man and er, or one woman, and we're just saying that the wording could be improved in that one little phraseology, that's all. On the job description. It was put together by, it was put together by the Chief Fire Officer and the Chief Executive er, not just the Chief Fire Officer. Right. I'm saying it could be improved, I'm sorry. Yes Colonel. Er, most officers would have accepted it and moved on to the next subject. Paragraph two was current solution to see the sort the place where the advertisers as widely as possible, presumably based on the job description . Here, there's no salaries attached to it at the moment. Erm, do we know how big the department's going to be, because that governs the salary? Where are we in relation to the sort of catch twenty two situation on this? The, the salary is stated I, I'd rather finish with the other question, or, or the made by the Major in the press question, are you, do you want to follow up the, I mean, have a vote on this if you want to? No Or is, or do you think the wording is suitable, or do you not? The wording's suitable. Yes I, I, I'm dead easy, I mean really it's a bit pedantic being pathetic. Leave it as it is, leave it as it is Leave as it is, and move on. Right now,c yes sorry, well we'll go back now. The, the post is currently graded at P O five, not P O six. After the exclusion of the public. Can we discuss after the exclusion of the public. Thank you sir. Yes Clearly er, it's er, again in, in paragraph four, under future budget of er, the services is going to be critical, if you've seen the last couple of years that are defined in the pay, and that's going to continue. As far as the short-term is concerned, er, part of the budget package in the current year, er, the retirement and the, the now proposal was to, to help up the side as regards that. Now it's referred in item one of the introductory paragraph, in the introduction about additional funding, and I just wonder where is the total for this additional funding? Is it from within the Public Protection Committee's overall budget, or is from elsewhere? If so, no. Well if we're going to start to go into funding, I'd rather this went into the pink paper session, and that we have our Chief Executives down here to explain that situation. I don't want to discuss this in open committee. Agreed? Yes. We'll put it as the last item. You have the situation Personnel, five, point one, sorry, five point one three is that right, so Er, five point nine I think Chair. Five point nine, optimistic, I'm getting terrible these days. Just a little bit optimistic,straight through to that, Yes, avoiding, oh yes, yes, yes, sorry, sorry. Avoiding, now What Future for Local Emergency Planning, National Conference. Now, I'm, I might have been remiss on this, but we had to do this in a hurry, erm, to get names in, and, but it's been suggested by erm, the leader of the er, Conservative group on, on this Committee, that erm, a, a, member from each should, major group should go, and er, I'm quite, I'm quite inordinate, in favour of this, if we can get erm, bookings there now. I'm, you know My feeling is Mr Chairman, it is an unpolitical er, erm, we're going Oh yes, yes into a new ground and, and er, I think it would be very useful if, if we yes, yes, I'm quite happy, providing we can get the erm Erm, I think I, yes Chairman, if, if, if you're prepared to attend that if you're saying that Providing that they're not all taken . No well that's, that's impractical and all, but You know it's, yes, yes. I don't know where it is. Okay are you all agreed? Yes, agreed. Are you going? Who's on transport? I don't believe this gentleman. We'll check, we'll find out before the end of the meeting. Thank you for our er, I've got a better one than those Five point one oh, annual inspection, am I right now? Yes, ten We know that Mr Chairman. Five point ten, yes. Erm, you're all aware of that? Five point eleven, Fire Safety Week, well that's gone past. It's quite useful We played on a different part Five point one, twelve, Brigade Festival at Cowes, an absolutely superb evening in my opinion, but somebody said it was bloody awful. Er, Well I think it was a marvellous evening. I think it was I can think of one c comment Chairman. The, they ran out of er, of carol sheets. We didn't expect c It,i I had the initiative in getting a prayer book, er, er, a hymn book from the back which er, after some concentration with the index or something, to er If you would pardon me on the sheet , it's a shame Mr 's not here, because that was his decision, because of the imposed cut in stationery from last year, we ran out of it Come on, come on Good for him. So he was sulking in a corner was he? Yes. Another criticism that I had was that it was far, far too elaborate and expensive programme, I thought it was a very cheap one. We printed it ourselves, Yes, yes The first one, was Yes, yes, Councillor . In spite of a lack of er, sort of er, carol sheets for, for some of us, it really was, as you say, a very enjoyable evening, and I was particularly erm, keen on the, the introduction of Saint Nicolas, and it certainly got smaller children, I think it was er, fantastic, and I certainly haven't enjoyed so er, I'll be back We diddled them out of er, Christmas presents which, which surprised me. But some of the children there erm, somebody must have been very, very, optimistic because we put a lot, a lot of presents in there, but anyway I think it was a superb night, and, and, and the meeting of er, to get together in the fire station afterwards, quite, in the Price Room was very good. Okay. Five point one three, five thirteen, Fire Brigade Long Service and Public Medals Ceremony. Once again a very enjoyable evening, erm, I pushed into something that er, I don't think she really wanted to do initially, but she thoroughly enjoyed it at the end. Chairman, she did it er, erm, very nicely,from the local That's right, that's right. The ladies concerned I think were very pleased er, erm, I do I think it's a very good idea, erm, to give a wife's medal and er, with all the medals, and we ought to provide money for them the amount of waiting about they have to do A very good evening. and they never know when Yes. It was a nice, nice gesture. A well organized evening. And where the beer did agree eventually, I mean under slight pressure. There's a photograph of her,and I'm quite sure we can give Joan to give to Vera one of those. Yes, yes thank you. I, I would like to see erm, I don't know whether this is done, but erm, when the official photographs are taken, they're done by erm, newspaper area, so that you get of the Lord Lieutenant, the Chief Officer, and the, the man from that area, and that is sent to the local paper, whether, ah in fact the local paper actually took photographs on that basis, and they grouped them by Yes, but erm, but Chairman, er, I don't think I should come up and make myself clear, some local papers were not represented there. Could they in future be sent? Could the photograph, the fire, the fire fighter probably won't think of it, could, could we think it for him, or her. Yes, we're lucky with the photographer actually, he's not a fire fighter, er, He is now He is now, okay. Er, five fourteen, paper L. Don has erm, been seconded to the Home Office for a period of two years. So I think we ought to congratulate him on that. Yes Hear, hear. And the other is the retirement of er, Divisional Officer . Could we just Twenty nine year service is a long time. can I be as could we be associated with that? Oh yes, well I, this is a Committee I'm talking about, not, not just myself, the whole Committee. Erm, when I speak, I speak on behalf of the whole Committee. A letter will be written to both on that? Yes, oh yes, yes. Okay. Chair, in respect of what erm, it's obviously it's er, good for the Authority that Mr is er, obviously , but what will happen to his post, right away, and what, will there be someone employed to actually fill in, I know there will probably be some moving up er,? Yes, we're interviewing so we're interviewing on Friday for somebody to fill that post. On the dates that you've anticipated if Mr comes back by that time we'll be able to absorb the post, but it's likely that he may move on from this, because it's a fairly substantial move up. In his next, next work when he leaves here he's going to be the Fire Service at the Houses of Parliament, and I'm serious, that will be one of his first major jobs. Not to mention things as trivial as Windsor Castle, and so forth. You don't sail that far down Will they listen to him, I hope. You're next authority. Chairman, he won't have to, it's like this, he won't have to worry as they did when the televisions which caused the last fire in the House of Commons, I mean, set fire to them and er, caused that one. It's quite er, it's quite a recommendation to de Brigade though isn't it Mr Chairman? And quite an honour to the brigade. Pardon? It's very prestigious, it's very prestigious. Yes, and I think I thought of a personal note that, because we do get some good, good appointments. As bad as we are. Okay we'll move on. No, I, I, I think, it is well done. Six, Quarterly Report of Chief Trading Standards erm, paper marked M. Yes Do you want to s enlarge on it Mr ? No No, no No you're alright Chairman. Can we note this Mr Chairman? There's quite a lot of useful information in here. I hope you've all read it. Yes I have, item, paragraph one, Mr Chairman, is right to do with the work that has to be done. Pardon? Pardon? Item one on M, Mr Chairman, the right of you with the amount of work that has to be done, and the amount of they're asked for Oh yes, yes okay. in growing demand or Six point two, deregulation. Chairman, if I could just er, erm, some words that aren't included in this pa paper, I understand that the Deregulation Bill is published on the eighteenth erm, and presented to Parliament for the first reading, erm, it's still far from clear what's going to be said in it, but erm, it's still widely expected that in fact, on major contentious issues will in fact be the suggestion that sections of Acts of Parliament will, could be revealed by ministerial order rather than go through the parliamentary process again. So it's an important issue er, of principle. The aspect to it is, as I've made clear in, in the, the report I hope,th they'd want to treat each erm, one that comes out of government on it's me merits. Er, I make the point I think that, erm, we should oppose the er, Deregulation Bill if it's based on providing deregulation by Ministers, because I think that's a constitutional point that is of great import, but the, the rest of it erm, are really sets of principles that I hope you'd agree to, subject to amen amendment and dis discussion, because the information that we got is that the consultation period is going to be very tight indeed, and that it might not be able to go through the normal committee procedures in order to put things through erm, with er, proposals in that, er, in that respect. If they're relatively technical, then I, then I'd be grateful if they can be left to the officers, but obviously if there's anything that erm, is political in anyway, big P or small P, then at least we can get in touch with the er, P A G, and if necessary call a meeting in respect Chair. But things are going to move on apace, and we need to, a set of principles the officers can work to, and I've put these down as a broad list, erm, for your consideration. I propose that Mr Chairman. All in agreement, Yes to the recommendations. Yes Paper O, That's purely for information Chairman. Paper P, genetically modified foods. I think the case is here is that er could have serious effects. That, er, Chairman, if I could say the thing that bothers me here is that, it always has done about food, is that we should be keeping up to date with information, all these decisions and all this advice. That seems to me a basic requirement of er, of all the sale of food. Er, it's been coming in gradually over the years, but there's been an awful lot of, of er, resistance by some manufacturers on what they say on their labels, and what they say about what they're selling us, and er, if they're gonna do this, and I'm getting a, a slight suspicion, and I think Mr is, that, that it's got to be done eventually, and we, we have to be able, as a buying public, to understand exactly what we're buying before we actually get it home. A chance to read, and be informed as to what we're buying when we buy it. Chairman, it's always been this Committee's policy over the twenty years, the twenty odd years that I've been here, back here ru runner, that erm, so far as the food side is concerned, er, we should be, our policy should be based on the information, the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and letting people make up their own minds. It's not been for us to tell people what they should or shouldn't eat or do anything with, because the, in, in one respect that's a nann nannying attitude from er, whether it's the legislators saying we're not going to approve the right legislation so that you have that information, but on the other hand by manufacturers and others saying you trust us. Well, in the cases we've taken over the odd twenty years against some of the biggest companies in the world indicate that that isn't the er, position. So, as far as the, the erm, erm,report is concerned er, if I've got to make a recommendation, because obviously people have got different views on this one, it would be in fact that we go for total er, information so that people can make up their own minds, and if, and it might be wrong, but they can exercise their own prejudices. And if they want to exercise those prejudices that's a matter for them. Erm, so that, that's the line that er, from a personal point of view I would erm, I would take, but I would obviously want members' views on that one. The other one, could I just correct something on the last line of er, comment at the bottom of the, bottom of page two. It says stock lives, it should be stock lines. But they are also trying to include the stock live aren't they, in some cases? Not their lives, No, it talks about the life as it's lying in store for instance. Yes, oh yes, yes indeed. Yes Anybody wish to speak or are you, do you accept the recommendations? A question if I may? In the er, appendix attached Yes er, there's talk about the er, government waiting for the recommendations from the Food Advisory Committee, when are they due? It's come out too, Chairman, that erm, there's been an, they dis they discussed that the minutes came out, and erm, what the Committee decided shortly was, the Committee felt strongly that, if the criteria for labelling were met, the requirement for labelling declaration should be a statutory one. They did not consider that this could be satisfactorily achieved by other means, such as non-statutory guid such as non-statutory guidelines. Er, based on the evidence which the public consultation produced the Committee considered that the primary concern of consumers was to be able to identify when a gene likely to be a cause of concern to a significant proportion of the population was present in foodstuff. This was reflected in the criteria which the Committee recommended should trigger a labelling declaration. As far as the form of labelling was concerned they believed that what was required was a simple declaration such as contains copies of X genes, in single ingredient foods and foods sold loose, they believe a declaration should form part of or accompanying the name under which food is offered for sale. For pre-packed foods which contain ingredients that contain copied genes, it recommended that a statement should be required to accompany the name of the ingredient in a list of ingredients. If a copied gene is present in an ingredient which was under current rules, it did not need to be listed, the declaration about its presence should nevertheless be made either in the ingredients list or next to the name of the er, food . And they went on then to consider lack of understanding of consumers about G M technology as a whole, and made recommendations for erm, er, better labelling, and for a erm, information campaign to be launched as well. But they didn't actually recommend that it should be statutory labelling Yes. The point I'd make, is that the difficulty of enforcement, in that respect. It's, it's one thing legislating, it's a completely different ball game when you are, erm, trying to enfor enforce it, and especially when you're trying to enforce it with ingredients imported from abroad. Well, when I say abroad, I mean from the E C as well. Erm, you can look after your own factories in this country, and you source ingredients, but you won't be able to do that for anything coming ov coming overseas. And the major manufacturers erm, there is a major trade in ingredients, between the multi-nationals as they pass things across. So the theory might not well work out in prac practice. But I honestly can't come up with any solution in that respect, because er, until you've got er multi-national enforcement agencies which no politician is going to agree to, erm, you're not going to solve the pro pro problem there. And if they think that it suits them to shift a factory to the Philippines because there won't be an inspection there, that's what they'll do. Can you note this Mr Chairman? That's depressing isn't it really? Very, but there you go. That's life, but we do what we can. And it's a statutory obligation in this country and that's really what you know. Because we can't just accept that, that manufacturers will look after it for us, because as you've, already said by the Chief, they'll move the factory where it I mean, you can even get a situation Chairman, where you'll get some of the big multiples will tell a, will agree specifications with a food manufacturer, but they're not going to be able to check on the ingredients, so even though the, the, the Sainsburys and the Marks and Spencers of this world say we don't want any er,gen genetically modified ingredients going into anything that we're going to buy, there's no way that they can guarantee that before we've even bought any. Having said that, do we accept the recommendations in this report? Yes Authorizations for legal proceeding. Proposed. Agreed. Registration of births deaths and marriages. It's for you Mr Nothing to add, er, if members have any questions I'll be happy to answer them. Noted? Charity Youth Committee, marked S. Do we have a member er, from that Committee? Yes Chairman, I am following in Major 's shoes, I don't reckon I know a great deal about it yet, and I'm not sure that this erm, er, advisory er, committee is yet actually on the go, but I will go into this. The stumbling block here does seem to be the inability of the Charity Commissioners themselves to keep up with the volume of work. Er, I am, Mr Chairman, I support that fully, because if you write to them it's six months before they'll reply. And you're wondering, I mean I don't think we can expect of the advice of charities now, or very little, you know, and, and they've got to be very, very careful I was meeting the Commissioners Pardon? I was leaving the Commissioners out as far as I could. Yes, yes, yes. It's a very meagre budget Chairman I should think we're getting off very lightly. Yes . Item nine, motion evenings and Saturday meetings. I propose that we retain the status quo Chairman. I'll second that I second that Are you all in favour of that? Yes West Mercia Police Authority, Paper C, now you received this late I'd be pleased to answer questions Chairman, and I'm sure Mr will help, help me deal with the budget crisis. And I shall endeavour to Well that's all you've got in front of you at the moment, isn't it, the budget Chairman? You have other things as well. Are there any questions? Pardon? Are there any questions, I'm asking, yes, I'm waiting for questions. Can I make an observation Mr Chairman, will you take observations as well? Yes, I'll take observat why, wait a minute. Yes, erm, on paragraph three erm, the, the last sentence erm, where it says without direct access to its own balances, the authority may therefore have to make revised precept in ninety four, ninety five erm, I understand what's being said there, but any organization needs to actually work within er, a clearly defined budget. Er, the Police Authority last year I think actually had to have an extra nine hundred thousand pounds of spending, the budget was funded by the constituent's authorities, erm, and we've already for next year in fact, made available effectively six hundred thousand pounds worth of extra spending by erm, various means, so I would hope that erm, the authority does use as, as much prudence and restraint in its financial affairs as possible, because of the, the effects on all, all concerned. Yes, Chairman, can I say that erm, when the b the budget's in the process of formulation and we're discussing the question of balances and reserves and how they should be marked for the immediate future, particularly in regard to the way that er, reorganization may take place at police authorities in the very near future, and also those of us who are on this, on, on other committees who've had experience in, and the same sort of thing happening in further education for instance, where immediately the assets, before even the regulations were put on the table, the assets of all these things were, all these er, erm,coll the further education colleges were frozen so we couldn't do anything with them at all as an Authority, and er, actually many of them were taken from us without er, without any question at all . So in the light of that it's per now is a good opportunity to er, make sure that those reserves and balances were available for A, the er, Police Authority should it require it, but B, to those constituent authorities who had helped in the er, build-up of these reserves. Now, what's being said here in that particular sentence, is that there are obviously going to be, or possibly could be occasions when er, the Police Authority has er, an overspend, which is an immediate problem for instance, on pensions, and you've heard the er, Fire Service Chief talking about his problems. They're just the same with the police force, there could be er, er, an increase in police pay,or there could be any, a very large incident which would require planning, if these happen then it has always been the case, if there wasn't the money available then a precept could be put upon us as a local authorities to er, cover that erm, directly. That's no different to what the situation is now, it was there before, the difference is that the banker is different. The banker is not the reserves of the Police Authority, because that has now been transferred to the authority. I should tell you that er, the budget really represents er, an increase in the availability of police resources over the previous years. I'm delighted with that, the budget came out er, much better than I'd hoped it would do, and er, and I, I am sure that we shall see some improvement in the police er, over the next year. Of course there is, there is the possibility, there is definitely going to be a reorganization, we shan't have the same sort of input I don't think, we shan't be allowed to have the same sort of input in a totally undemocratic er, er, authority that's going to be there where the, the governments will er, put er, most of the people on board, where the Home Secretary will decide on the Chairman, er, we don't know what the government regulations are going to say about balances in terms for the new authority. Er, if they say that er, they should be er, a balance or reserve put in by constituent authorities then we will have the money available to do that, if we didn't then they may have frozen the reserves that are already there and asked us to put some more money in as well. I find that is the situation that I've tried to er, guard against with the budget that we've been put in on this occasion, and I hope that answers er, er, Mr but er, I'll answer any other questions that are put up. Thank you very much. Could I say Chairman,in Worcester and Shropshire are in agreement with this budget and er, which has been engineered to a great deal by the Chairman of the Budget and er, we're here to, Yes I don't, I don't mind worked out, but engineered gives a very Regarding paragraph nine Chairman, no doubt you, you would tell us if there's been a response on this, because this does seem a useless step forward er, to increase the number of people at the coalface as it were, and self-financing, and no doubt we shall hear in due course about this. The Authority are pushing as much as they can on the scheme and there's been no response to yesterday. It's a crazy situation, because when Clarke was the Home Secretary, and he made a, a speech in parliament, we adjourned a meeting of the Authority to listen to him speaking, now we'd already made applications er, to increase the number complete officers by the, getting rid of the superintendents, and Clarke came out with what we'd said, yes, do that, but the Home Office are still saying no you can't. Er, I mean the whole lot separately, Yes, yes, I mean it's crazy. if I can comment on that Chairman, the erm, the Authority asked for thirty for next month, along with all the other authorities I think in the country, asked for an improvement in the, in the policing the country, and I think people that live in, in Shropshire, and the people that live in other er, parts of the country as well, would have welcomed the increase in the police force this year, but the government decided not to do that. We, we then had this situation where the, er, the Chief Constable ha went to great lengths to er, work out a new establishment for himself, and the senior management, and actually ach chi and er, and preempted it and then asked the er, the Home Office if he could use the money to increase the constables on the beat. We are still waiting for them to agree or not to that. The feeling at the moment is that they are sympathetic towards us, and they don't see any difficulty in that as yet, but no one is prepared to put their hand up and say yes go ahead and spend the money in that way. But the money is in the budget Chairman, I want to make that quite clear, the money is here in, in the West Mercia Police budget to be able to provide sixteen extra policemen immediately. Police Officers. Policemen immediately that that is given to us by the Home Office. I hope the Authority unanimously do support it. Yes, I think Chairman, you ought to ask your Committee to note paragraph six, I think that's quite important and worthy of note. Because we employ a lot of Can I record we've received this here Mr Chairman? Move the reports received? Yes. Now it is recommended that we in section nine and four A, in brackets four, someone move. Chairman, can he just report to us? Right, Chairman, if we can just go through this briefly. Erm, number thirty six. Erm, it contains access to four, five and they'll be submitted after discussion at this particular Committee, to Policy Planning or the Policy Resources Committee. As we've made perfectly clear in the last discussion we've just had, no final decisions on the implementation of any variations will be taken until Council meets on the twenty fifth of February. This booklet was distributed just before met, so in fact er, paragraph two does say at the moment that in our new recommended programme there isn't, well in fact they did agree those recommendations. In addition though, and we come on to them in a second, it asks for further reductions to be added to that if possible. But the provisional guid the guideline which was set by Policy and Resources in the first instance, was just for this Committee to identify seventy thousand pounds' worth of reductions. Those reductions were those identified in paragraph three and perhaps I do need to point out in fact that according to the report in Policy and Resources Committee, the use of carry forwards from the registration service of twenty thousand pounds in fact needs to be replicated across all three years. Now quite clearly that has er, implications on the registration service and believe the County Secretary will talk about that at some future point. Erm, paragraph four erm, outlines there is a gap after these new guidelines of six hundred and seventy one thousand, and to bridge that gap, the P and R asked that er, the Fire and Rescue Service identify a hundred thousand pounds of sur of reductions from its budget. The audition which is the additional item includes moves at Policy and Resources Committee that they asked all committees to expose further reductions if possible to help close this gap of six hundred and seventy one thousand pounds. Just find it on the kind of introduction. The other guideline which was issued was namely that of capital, where the a accepted the general guidelines which appeared in the county papers and as far as this Committee was concerned, would mean the general acceptance of all those items which appear in that the first year of that capital programme, subject to the proviso that the revenue contemplated and the benefits of the capital programme will be considered by Policy Panel in its forthcoming meeting. As far as the introduction is concerned I have nothing more to say. I am, unless there are any questions, can we not then five, move on to number five? Er, one question if I may Chair? Erm, I note that on paper R earlier, we er, approved the recommendation to ask Resources Management sub-committee to approve the release of three thousand of registration service carry forward monies, and we're now being asked to approve our budget next year, which er, also reduces twenty thousand for registration service. Can we be told please exactly what the er, balancing hand of carry forwards shown on the right estimates, the twenty three thousand consists of? Are they, what, what are those are registration services? That, the thirty three thousand includes twenty three thousand of the registration services carry forwards, but it does not take into account the three thousand which have just been requested here. So that would reduce it down to twenty. I just want to make sure we have the money now. If you, if you like, I could speak now Chair? Yes Er, naturally we're disappointed you're proposing to take er, twenty thousand of our twenty three thousand carry forwards in the registration service. The problem is as Mr has said, if that is expected to be replicated across future years, this would represent a ten percent reduction in the statutory service, er, which is only partly under control of this Committee, with mixed responsibilities with the Registrar General. Seventy percent of the expenditure is on staff who you do not employ and cannot dismiss, a large part of the income, or all the income is through the fees that are set na nationally by the government. You have very little room for manoeuvre within this service, and the Registrar General has reserve powers to impose services on you, and I would have to advice you it would be virtually, or I would have to say it would be impossible to achieve that ongoing reduction in future years. Erm, does the Chair wish er, me to reach section by section, or do you wish to take the bookings as they are Chairman? Well I think we've got to take it section by section. In that case the, the white page which isn't numbered at the back of page three, is the revised estimate, and shows the variations as outlined there. Erm, the only variations which are actually going outside the Committee control are as a result of the internal market variations which are going on down . Plus of course the growth in the Firemen's Pension Scheme of thirty one thousand in the current financial year, rising in future years. Otherwise the Committee services are containing their budgets within original cash limits. If there are no questions on the revised estimates Chair, then the, the base budget for ninety three, ninety four are those outlined on the green pages, identified it certain service by service. It's on these figures which in effect any Committee reductions will be made. I have nothing further to say on the green pages. Do members have any questions? Okay, does anybody Before, before you go on, you say that the twenty thousand can't be rep replicated in income registration column, does that show, how would show in here then? It doesn't show, it doesn't show in here, no. If the registration service was erm, asked to ma to reduce its budgets for ninety four, five and future years, by twenty thousand, it could do it in to three, four, five because it would bring forward twenty thousand pounds worth of carry forwards. However in five, six, its net expenditure would reduce to erm, two hundred and twelve thousand pounds. And from what County Secretary's just said, we would be unable to identify reductions in statutory service to live within that cash and The salmon pages then Chair, are those items which have been put forward to achieve the guidelines set by Policy and Resources Committee. In additions, I would remind members of the request from Policy and Resources to try and identify wherever possible further savings, in aid of the six hundred and seventy one thousand pound gap which currently exists between budget proposals and the expected figures. Any, yes Mr A couple of comments on that Chair, the first one, on the reduction in carry forwards, my understanding is that, in fact it's quite amusing in some ways, because this, this is something I was accused of as Chair of Resources Management during my year. Er, what in fact this Committee is doing, is saying that at one of the sections that makes up part of it, you happen to have carry forwards spare from last year, therefore use them because we can't identify anything else in budget savings for this, next year. Erm, that isn't necessarily the same as saying by the way your section will have to repeat that saving in future years. I think it's quite legitimate for this Committee to take that twenty thousand because it's there, and to say to itself, post budget we will have to look at the whole of the areas covered by budget protection to find the replicated twenty thousands in future years, and not just expect it to come from registration. Erm, from the comments from the table that seems to be generally agreed. Yet the point, it's a question really, which refers back to the last programme summary three, of the, the ninety four, ninety five base budget. Within that we're, we identified a gross expenditure and a gross income across all areas of the Committee's work. Now clearly some of those are, are outside our direct control. Nevertheless there's five hundred and fourteen thousand as our income that the Fire and Rescue Service, the Fire Training Unit, from the Trading Standards Department, and from Emergency Planning. My question is, has the P A G looked at any ways of increasing any of that income to any degree at all? And if so, what were their findings? We have reviewed charges on, and the Fire Service, erm, in the past, and, and we've increased certain erm, but we didn't see any way we could, we could increase any more at that time. So far as Trading Standards is concerned Chairman, the major income are weights and measures testing fees and they are set down by LACOTS, that's Local Authority Courts on Trad on Trading Standards on er, an agreed scale, so we charge exactly the same as other authorities, for the same, for the same work, and we increase the fees every year, er, in line with erm, the recommendation. Er, the amount that we get, get in depends on erm, the amounts of trade and industry. We've done relatively well in the past couple of years because we've had a lot of petrol pumps, because of the new, the opening of the big supermar the, the supermarkets where there's thirty, forty pumps go going, we make a fair bit of money in that way. But you can't guarantee that, er, and once the supermarket developments er, have gone, then you'll drop off down, down again, and again you're affected by the rece recession, whereas people won't replace things like weighbridges, er, automatic weighing machines that sort of thing during the recession, if you come out of recession, then you might get, and you say you might get some increase in fees in that, that area. But those are always considered er, during the erm, er, revised estimates time in any way. The other one and that erm, the major source of income are court, court costs, and again that depends on the cases you're taking, it depends on the, on the amount awarded by er, magistrates. Over the years, we've taken the risk to increase the court's costs, erm, where we've got agreed pro er, principles, and we've b we've been able to go to the courts and they've agreed with us, for instance, standard fees for overloaded vehicle cases, we charge seventy pounds a time. Er, and the courts by and large agree to erm, give us the seventy pounds out ev every time, but even so, even if we get the award of the costs, then the difficulty is, is, is in getting those costs in. Erm, it's up to the magistrate's clerk and sometimes the first So it's in the Fire Service that we've actually got time posted, and in fact most of the things that we wish to charge for we're actually statutorily prohibited from doing. Things like false alarm calls and so on, have been through the courts and we've been stopped from doing that. We charge the highest rate in the country for issuing fire certificates which is one of the few things which we're actually allowed to charge, and we charge more than virtually any other authority in this country. The trouble about that is, it's now enforced upon us and that's official target, we have to set priority of fire certificates because we need the money, bluntly, otherwise we have to find it elsewhere, so we give them a priority that they wouldn't otherwise have. Er, in terms of training, commercial training and it's not just the Fire and Rescue Service I spoke recently with the Chief Ambulance Officer, who's experiencing the same problems. Training's the first thing that goes, in a recession, that's the first thing that people cut, and not only, well we are achieving the fixed amount of income that we're obliged to in order to make previous reductions, but we're certainly not covering costs. So what you're effectively doing at the moment is subsidizing the private commercial sector. Erm, everything else we've looked at, there are either statutory problems or other problems that prevent us from charging. So it's, if further income generation is limited, it's through external circumstances rather than any internal increases. So we've really, we've really no alternative but to accept the hostage three, one to three on the reductions. It's best as I see it. Erm, salmon paper. We, we've got not alternative, did you say? Well I, I think that that's exactly what the Committee was saying to the Minister there. No, no. We, we, I thought were all saying that we felt that these reductions were actually unacceptable, or totally un almost I finally got back, washed the lorry out and I just couldn't finish washing the wagon out. I started to feel sick, was vomiting, I had very bad diarrhoea and I sort of stayed in bed for like a couple of days, very very poorly. At twenty nine Somerset farmer Julian Westcot fears his working life may be over. He was hospitalized this Summer after shearing sheep which had been dipped in O Ps. I was laid up for five weeks, couldn't do any work whatsoever and just sleep, cuss the family, be generally grumpy, tired and achy. When I took him in he was at such a stage he had to go in in a wheelchair. Erm he couldn't walk at all. He was I think he'd passed out in the car. The mobile dip Julian worked on now lies abandoned. The man with the power to ban O P dips is Professor James Armor, Vice Principal of Glasgow University and chairman of the government's veterinary products committee. It's whether they will be withdrawn or not. I Obviously I can't preempt a discussion, but if we think on the evidence we see in in October that er that that is the course to take, we would do so. But if we do not think that, er or we think there are possibly problems in in relation to to using protective clothing, we will also do that. The Agriculture Minister Gillian Shephard will make the final decision and it's expected she'll do so within a month. Affected farmers will learn then if O Ps have been reprieved or banned. Only then can the battle for compensation begin. Adrian Pitches, B B C News. Scientists in France have found a new way to bring the past back to life. They're using computers and virtual reality technology to interpret historical records. And as our science correspondent David Whitehouse reports, it means we can now see what cities and building looked like hundreds of years ago. Today they're just ruins in a Paris suburb, it's hard to imagine what these roman baths looked like when they were new. But thanks to virtual reality, we can come as close as is possible. Using historical records computer scientists have reconstructed the building, fifteen hundred years after it was ruined. Inside these roman baths, the marriage of archaeology and computer science is complete. British scientists are exited by this new way of bringing ancient buildings back to life. I can stand in front of the screen, I can look at the simulations, I can stop them whenever I want to stop them and look at them, it gives me ideas about how the buildings might have looked at that time and it gives me a whole range of variations as to as to what can be done in terms of their reconstructions. Recreating ancient buildings involves a lot of painstaking work translating archaeological records into computer code. I B M U K are at the forefront of the new science of virtual archaeology. First you make a fairly detailed ground plan, and then you essentially turn that ground plan into a three dimensional plan inside the computer. And that's quite a time consuming step. I believe in the case of these baths it took about one man year to do that transformation. But then once the computer's got that, you just have to say, pretend I'm standing here, and the computer's capable of saying, This is what you would see. But the most ambitious example of virtual reality, is Clanne Abbey, also in France. Built in the year nine O nine, for six hundred years it was the largest enclosed building in the world. Torn down during the French revolution, little remains. But scientists have reconstructed it showing what it would have looked like. using almost three thousand hours of work on a major computer, the result is a stunning walk through the abbey as it would have appeared in the eleventh century. Scientists are excited by this computer approach to archaeology and they've plans to reconstruct other great buildings of the past bringing them to life once again. David Whitehouse, B B C News. And the main news again, there've been renewed calls tonight for the police to be armed after a community policeman was murdered. P C Patrick Dunn was described as an honest gentle local bobby. Judge Tumim's report into the riot at Wymott prison in Lancashire says the jail was close to anarchy. John Prescot has won a key post in the new shadow cabinet, moving from transport to employment. The next national news is the Nine O'clock news, from Jenny and What do you get the headphones for as well? I don't know. He didn't seem to know what they were in there for. Oh. Well you can listen to what you've taped with the headphones. What? You can listen to what you've taped. Oh You can play it back yeah, if you want to. Oh. I notice if you put the the headphones in it would erm you'd maybe be listening to it as it's taping? I don't think you can do that. Did you have to sign for something to say that you've had it? To say I've had it, yeah. Yeah. When's he coming back? Next Friday. Next Friday, oh right. And is that the microphone? Yes. And are you supposed to wear that? Er stick it in your t wherever, yeah. In your Stick it where you like. , you what? Stick it where you like. But d does it need to be uncovered? No. It's got erm it's own recording level. Yeah. And even if it and are you supposed to tell people that you're recording what they're saying or just record it Erm and then tell them afterwards? I suppose you should tell them that you're going to tape the conversation maybe, yeah. Yes. I don't suppose that matters really. But I mean, if you erm if you put your headphones on you see, they might just think erm you're listening to a Walkman. And er they would come up with some bad language towards you. Then especially if you told them you were recording what they said . Could be dangerous. I've asked Brian to take the dog out as well, when he comes back. I won't have time now. No. And I'm going to Chester tomorrow. Are you? Yeah. Ah! Didn't I tell you about that? There's no petrol in the car. You mean every time I have that car I have to put petrol in. No I put it in the last two times. Twenty quid's worth. So you'll have you watch my little car. Watch it or wash it? Watch it. Be careful. I'll be very careful with your little car John. Well it's not far to Chester. It's not as far to Chester as it is to Swansea is it? I don't suppose it is. Mm? No. Go the motorways though, if you can. Oh. You'll have to watch for, for the roadworks. I mean the roadworks on the M 6 are diabolical now. Mm. I it took us three and a half hours coming back from Swansea. But we stopped off for half an hour as well. And I think it's longer coming back that way. Over the bridge. No it isn't. It isn't. You sure? I'd be positive. Shorter. Cos th I remember the first time I went down that way over the bridge. It was about a hundred and eighty miles I clocked up. Er but coming back I only clocked up about a hundred and twenty. What was the mileage when we got there? A hundred and eleven? Something like that, yeah. So it was three hundred coming back or total three hundred. I can't remember now exactly. I I think it does make a difference, going over the bridge. I I found it when I was driving the last time. But I couldn't remember where the turn off was to come up the scenic route. Cos I was reading, and you'd passed it. Yeah well you could erm go up, go down the M 50 into Ross and then go from there. Yeah but th there was a turn off and I didn't know whether the turn off was at Cardiff and we went past it. Yeah, there is a oh to go back that way? Yeah. Yeah. You could turn off for Abergavenny again. Abergavenny yeah, but that was, that was going straight up So, where's she gone now? Who, Patricia? Well, she was going to Birmingham and then she was going to in a careers office. They close at about four o'clock don't they? Yeah, very probably. And she was hoping that they would have sent her for an interview down there. In the afternoon. Think she's probably staying in Birmingham. Well, Birmingham's on the cards cos Steve, Stevey-boy works there doesn't he? Pardon me? What? Food. Come on Brian and get in the shopping. Food food food food food food How's Brian? food food. Glorious food. no doubt. Oy. Your dinner's on top of the cooker. Plate might be hot. Eh! Who's got a Walkman? Me. How come? A bloke give me one. Told you we should have let him in. Oh it's got a microphone as well. Yeah. It's on at the moment. Recording? Oh I see. Why's that? Oh some experiment? Right. Some market research just to see how many times you swear at me. Really? Yeah. Oh that's good. So there will be er plenty on it. We should win any competitions then. Hands down I think. I can't eat any more of that. Macaroni cheese? Mm. Hey. It tastes alright for a few mouthfuls and then it like gets a bit monotonous. I've just been up to Tesco's. Mm? Who were you talking to? I was talking to er Simon and Dave and all the rest of the lads Yeah. Bragging about your bike. And er, no actually. Dave goes have you got your bike yet? I goes yeah, just been to pick it up. He goes oh and I suppose you loved every minute of it? What's that grey thing John? Has it fallen off the roof? Ooh. What's what? That grey thing on the ground. Oh yeah. It's off the erm Flue? No, it's off Vent? It's off the toilet erm The vent. the vent. Oh I'll pop back out there. I'll put it in the garage. We won't lose it then. It just slides on. But the wind licked it off I suppose. I'm definitely not putting it back on today, but I will put it back on . Well Do you know that chap two doors down with the B M W? Mm. The wind set his alarm off. Really? Mm. On his car? Shook it? Yeah. Mm, must be very sensitive. Upstairs, on the bed, vaseline on your nose. Now. Move it. How much did my shopping come? Go on. Eight pound seventy. Go upstairs. Oh that was good. Hurry up. What? He's going as well. He's gone. He goes upstairs, on the bed, vaseline on your nose go on. And he's gone up. I think he's getting hooked on the taste of vaseline, that dog. Yeah. So it's I'm gonna pop round to Matt's tonight. Who's Matt? Matt . Where's he live? Bromsgrove. Mm. He the one with the bike? Yeah. The one that dropped out of college? Work. Yeah. Yeah. Well I'll ring him up. See if he's in. You mean you're not going to show off to John ? Oh yeah. I'm gonna call for him on the way. Does he know Matt? No. I seen Andy in town today walking round with his erm headphones in. Oh yeah. Mm. That tasty? It is actually. It's a bit big though. Well John demolished my little omelette pan. Oh I see. Mm. So I had to use his frying pan. Rick. Let's have a look at your face. Oh nice. Did you get vaseline on? Mm. Oh, yeah I've got some now. Did you get your vaseline on Rick?good boy. I wonder if these people that have to listen to these tapes can understand doggy language as well? No. No? What do you think Rick? Did John tell you anybody that takes part will get erm a Marks and Spencers' voucher? Oh? Mm. Wonder if we'll get any, any vouchers for the dog? In the pet food shop. He makes enough noise doesn't he? Yeah, yeah. It was also noted today at these er presentations that I was the one with the least Brummie accent. Oh. Which made me feel good. Well except for Andy. Mm we oh yeah Andy's Nigerian. The Nigerian. Mm. Yeah. Except for him of course, but Cos I was getting a bit upset that my voice was going a bit Brummie. Oh right. I've given her her hairdryer back on trial, I've told her. If she leaves it plugged in and switched on again she won't get it back. Yeah. She's definitely unplugged the hairdryer and she's unplugged her radio as well. Because it ain't on. I ain't having the house burnt down. Bloody hairdryers. Well want to know if Rick joins in the conversation will we get any vouchers for doggy food? Yeah, we do don't we? Yeah we do. You are cheeky. What about her food? Tell Mary. Tell Mary all about it. I don't want to know about it Rick. Well who, who noticed that you had the least Brummie accent? The instructors Oh. and all the other lads. Oh right. Did they record it or that, no? Which is a good job. Mm. Cos most of us were petrified anyway. And that's a bit like that erm the teaching skills that I had to do that time when I was on the course. Mm? Erm and I had to think up something that I do as a hobby er to teach other people. I, I did those little flowers you see and took them in. And er it is quite nervewracking really to sit there. Specially when the instructors come over and they're sort of sitting watching as well. Well the bad thing was, as soon as I picked my cards up I dropped them all you know? Mm. All your flash cards? Good morning yeah. Good morning ladies and gentlemen pshoow and they, they went all over the place. So I had to pick them back up mm sorry. Bit of nerves. Be back to front now, this morning yeah? John wants me to er sew his trousers for him. Oh. I'm waiting on him picking up the machine. It tickles me the way they call it portable and you can hardly lift it. we took Patricia in to, we give her a lift as far as Longbridge today. She was going back to get her coat changed. And then she was going to the careers office. And erm they were going to send her for an interview straight away. I told her to be home reasonably early but she's not home yet. Well not far I know. Don't let it beat you. I dunno mum. Only a little omelette. Yeah but it was bigger than the plate. You had to fold it in half to get it on. That's what I said to John I said you've got your dinner in between an omelette. Yeah. That's right. I thought I could call it erm a Spanish omelette. What I tried to do was one of those Did you have ploughman's things. did you have a surplus of eggs or something? Pardon me. Well erm, I knew you wouldn't eat sort of sliced ham on its own with erm vegetables. So I knew you would eat it like that in an omelette. Mm. I mean, if it had of been smaller. Well, I'll have a go but I may not eat all this but if it was smaller it's really tasty as well. Mm. But you liked those erm were they countryman's or ploughman's in a packet and you just throw them into the pan and cook it for about fifteen minutes? And that was just potatoes and eggs wasn't it? And some cheese. And bacon. Don't remember. Oh. What I want to do, I want to cut the shopping down as much as I possibly can. Well I think eight pounds is a good start. But when I go to the shops and I spend seventy pound for a week. We have to keep making trips back to the shop because we need bread or milk or something else that we've forgotten. So so just make little trips. So we're just making little trips as we run out of stuff. Mm. Good idea. And see how, if that will work out any better. Yeah. Well the good news for the environmentalists is the bike runs on unleaded. Mhm. Which is good news. Cos like that's not so expensive. So, I shall have to take it to the petrol station in a minute. Yeah. Does, and does it need erm oil or anything like that? No. He showed me where the little oil level was. So you don't have a dipstick, there's a little little ho glass hole Mhm. where you look in. Oh right. With a a maximum and a minimum. Mhm. Like on your dipstick. And you just look at it. Mm. Mm. Well, just be careful when you go out. Yeah. Cos I mean it's it's not the bikers it's the other vehicle that's on the road. Alright? Not more than two minutes. John will verify this. Do you remember John? We came out of the shop, turned left turned left there, and then turned right. We're going down this road and John was in front of me and just as John went past this wagon it pulled out and there was a car coming the other way. Eeeeh hit my horn. Ha I could have shouted louder. And he stopped and luckily there was just enough room for me to slow down and just go between them. I mean that guy just pulled out in front of me. Mm. Huge, huge lorry. Oh he he didn't see you or just didn't ? Didn't care. Oh. He saw me alright cos like John said I had the headlights on. Yeah. Well that's it. Don't expect anybody else to obey the highway code. Yeah. Right? Did you see them two dirty great big no right turn signs? What no right turn signs ? You what? I said to the bloke I said how do you get out that junction? He said you don't, there's no right turn. I looked up the road and there was two great big signs, no right turn. I'd already gone that way twice. Yeah. And turned right. Yeah. Cos it's a very awkward junction. Mm. Thank you mum. Dog's looking at you. What do you want Ricksy? Come on then. What is it Ricky? Come on then.. dog. I don't see any I don't I don't see any bacon in there. You're not having bacon till Monday. Are you gonna buy it tomorrow? No. Oh. You're working, so you don't need bacon. I'm not working Monday. Well you can go and get it. Saturday Sunday. Let's have some wh when? Monday. I'll be up then. I won't need it. Well I might get it Sunday for you. Okay. But we talk about this and we said we're cutting the shopping down, I'm not going shopping. And the first thing you do is demand that we have butter in the house. So we had to go and do shopping just to get your butter. No you didn't. You bought dog food. You bought milk. Yeah I didn't I didn't actually need to go shopping or I didn't want to go shopping. You did. You needed butter. No. You needed butter. There's margarine. Alright. Don't you eat it. Don't you touch that butter. Right. I won't. Nor anybody else. If you're saying you're buying the butter solely for me, then I just want me solely to eat it. Cos I'm not carrying the can. I needed butter as well. Brian, you're not to eat it. What! Not even on my toast at night? No. She says you had to go out and buy butter solely because I wanted it. And I've Oh I've had the bollocking cos we've had to buy butter. Well I wanted it as well so that's two against one. And if you see her, see her eating our butter there will be a row. Cos you've said that. I won't have Flora on the toast. I think that's horrible. It goes all watery. Look I'm not amused at all. Well neither am I. na na na na na He said he wants butter. Yeah. Well why couldn't you put up with margarine for one day? Oh we could have. But I didn't mind going shopping. Yeah well sh I wouldn't have minded just for today. I I didn't mind going I didn't s I I didn't say Now you say that I didn't say I'd got to have it today. Cos I don't. Yes you did. No I did not. You s your suggestion was send Brian to the shops. Not mine. Now that was the Well can you empty one of those and put it and put it in that bucket. Will you turn that tape recorder off so I can thump him. Thumping me probably won't come out on the tape. I came out with the awful truth today to the lads. So you dropped it. They loved it. So you told them you fell off your bike? You said you're not gonna believe this. He goes why aren't you on your bike Brian? I goes I went to the end I goes look I'll tell you all together get it over with I lost my balance and I dropped it. Alright? There you go. Er thank you. Bye. Whoa come here, come here. Tell us all about it. He goes what you done? I goes ah just broken the indicator lens and a few other little bitties. He'll eat that. One of yours. Did you like that John? I'm not finished yet. There's another two plays on tomorrow. Tomorrow? Okay. I'll sort them out. Oh you've been up to Joe 's have you mum? Mm? Have you been up to Joe 's? Got more in . Mm?special? I think you were a bit. Shut up Rick. He's crying his eyes out in there. Three hundred and ninety pounds insurance. Not too bad. I've gotta get that down a bit. Mm. ten pound for the cover note. You know just for Really? three or four days. Yeah. You know while while the changeover has been done. Got my registration number today. Mhm. J One O two. Is it TOV or? Anybody want any more chips? One O two two. My new number. Oh. W Y C or something. No thanks. No thanks Mary. W Y C I think it is. So all the ones you see T O C and Yeah they've got O in them. Or V. Yeah. T O V or whatever. Go and lie down. At one time the V was only for, for commercial vehicles. Mm? You know light vans and commercials but it's used for anything now. You know our car's D V P. Yeah. Oh and I can't eat that bread and butter now. I'm chockered. Yeah one of the, one of the lads there Alan, he goes er I'm surprised you haven't committed suicide yet after dropping your pride and joy. Well it does hurt your pride. Oh yeah. Specially when you do it in front of all the neighbours. Can't show my face again. I'm afraid we cannot have any of this. Too . Hope it's dry tomorrow. I won't feel so bad about going to work on it then. If it's wet just take your time. Yeah. Keep it upright. I can't understand how I did it you know. Well you didn't realize it was going over did you? No. It catches you by surprise. I think I must have had my weight to the front of the bike, you know, coming up on the braking. Er this tap's dripping. When does the insurance run out? Eh? When does the insurance run out? Where does? The insurance run out. It's run out. Wednesday. Oh Wednesday. Quick, ring up. Shouldn't be dripping. Pressure's not high. Pressure was down again this morning. We must keep an eye on that. Yeah. Cos between one and two bar on the, on the erm boiler. What was it on? Eh? It means, means the system wasn't pressurized. Yeah. But it could be very dangerous. It's not right. Will it give a constant read out through the day? Even when it's switched off? Yeah. It shouldn't move. Oh. The pressure's okay Mary. Cos I didn't notice it this morning. I didn't notice it this morning. Probably be alright to use the hot water system but not the heating. Oh right. Because it's a pressurized system. So if you have a look and you can't see that needle. Yeah. The, the water is the water pressure's definitely changed. Well it's changed now cos it's up now. I in the shower in the shower for one. It's up now. I it's weak in the shower. Er well it would have been. There was no pressure on it. No, it's always weak. It's always weak in the shower now. Mm? It's never as strong as it used to be. It shouldn't be. It should be okay. And it's cold as well. Have you noticed? Yeah I was I had a shower, well, perhaps the water's been turned down a bit. I I keep turning it up again but it it's cold every time I use it. You know I pull it out and turn it up hot. No I mean here. Oh there. On the boiler. That water. Rick. It's only one and a half. It should be higher than that. I'll put it up to two and a half and it should be warm enough there. Right. Lovely. Is just? Well we'll have to watch that boiler. Yeah. They're fatal if we, if it. You just opened the door on the dog's mouth. Opened the fridge door and hit him right on the Yeah. right in the mouth didn't you Rick? Poor Rick. My poor baby. Aah! Come, what did she do to you? What have I got for you? Hang on, hang on. How much do you love me? That much? Okay. You're only having little bits. You're not having any bones or anything like that. We'll have to keep it out, and use it. Is there a time limit? Forty five minutes a side so it's erm I mean no. When he wants it all done by. Yeah, Saturday. Saturday? All those tapes? Well as many as possible. That's what I mean. We'll have to keep it out. Somebody's put it away you see. Mother. Yeah. Oh I don't doubt it. There's only one person that commits the mortal sins. That's it. Yeah. And her name is mother. Well I'm certain it begins with M. Rick. You're not having any rice. No. Where's all this paperwork? That's all mine. What you looking for? Paperwork belongs to this. Mary. Ooh! That hurt. Mary. I didn't want him to have that. Mary. Mary where's the paperwork belonging to that? I dunno John. Oh that's some of it. Have a, get it all out then Brian. There's a book in there I've gotta fill in. That's it. That's it. There doesn't happen to be a pen in there does there? Oh I see one. That my erm cover note? I've no idea. Friday the thirteenth. What a day to buy a motorbike. See the value of the bike came down, the value of the insurance came down cos I put the value at twelve hundred pounds. See erm there was a ten percent discount if you had it erm under twelve hundred and fifty pounds. Yeah. So in some ways it's cheaper insurance but in others it's erm a bit of a sting. Have you done? Come on. Oy. See that machine there? What does it do? It hides behind mother so that Brian can't get at it. No. This plates go in this way. Well I'm not allowed to use this machine so er Knives and forks should go in that way. Right? Why that way? There are glass plates somewhere. Have you made any tea Mary? No. No. Do you want some tea? I want to get into the habit of finishing and getting the dishwasher on and ge cleaning the kitchen completely. I told him to ring I told him ring Apex up in case they were recruiting. Because there are jobs up on the notice board. But he said Apex didn't know anything about it at the moment. So I mean, if Apex don't know anything about it I don't know why they don't . Now you know I don't get on with plastic. Oh I got it first time. I got it first time. Oh god. Tell her there will be half a pie for her tea otherwise she don't get none. I mean this is ridiculous. Yeah. Turn that on for me will you? Just It's making work for everybody. And one thing we don't want is extra work. I mean if we get finished now and clean the ki cooker and and clean everything and say right, we're out of the kitchen then, nothing more tonight. That's it. If they want something they can get it themselves. Yeah. Yeah but tell them to clean up after them. Mm. Don't leave it for you all the time. Yeah. Lynn doesn't cook any meals for any of them. No. Well I mean that's different to the way we live though isn't it? Mm.? Mm? Packet of instant mash. Tin of peas and a tin of spam. Mm, could you imagine me Lovely. And throws it all in puts it all on the plate cold and puts it in the microwave. No wonder he sits in the chair and does nothing. Because they do it at home. Eat that food now. I've had enough of you. You're being perfectly silly. Erm, I can't think what you do tomorrow when you go with Steve . I mean that will be three hours continuous. Yeah. I remind me in the morning. Yeah. I'll stick a note on the thing. Yeah. Eh? you forget about it Yeah. Don't put it away then Mary. Pardon? Don't put it away, you'll have to leave it out for the week. Seventeenth tomorrow isn't it Mary? Mm? Seventeenth tomorrow? Yeah. I'll have to, I shan't Yeah. Mm. I've put a list up erm for the things that I want for my birthday. For the things that I would like for my birthday. Are you interested? Yeah. John, how much do I owe you for the erm the lens? Phaw one twenty five. Can I this? Yeah. Yeah so I'll keep it in the garage. Keep it in your pocket. Right. It's no good in the garage. Oh oh. There you go. I'm reduced to pennies again. Okay. Well I've got no change. That's alright.

Not a cartridge pen and not a set. Just a fountain pen on its own. Number nine is gold earrings. Stud type not drop type, studs. Number ten's perfumes talcs and books. Number eleven is an ornament from the jewellers. Number twelve, nightdress and negligee set. Number thirteen, no chocolates please. And that's it. Okay. Pin that up on the board. Yeah. And what you will have to do, you will have to tell each other what you would like to buy or what you would think of. Because, if you scrub them off then I'll know that you're gonna buy them. Cross off the health farm. You can buy me er the locket, the eternity ring, the premium bonds and the weekend away at the health farm. You'd be lucky to get one. Good. I think you're getting as bad as me. Oh I got it from you. Coming out with your list of what you want for your birthdays. I thought well I'll try it. Where's the nearest loan company? Mm? Where's the nearest loan company? Brian. Me. I know. So When are you gonna cross my palm with silver? She I forgot about that. Yeah. When are you going to That will wipe the smile off your face. I do you want me to get it tomorrow for you? Mm. Cos I can call in at the bank and get it to No, don't get it till I want it to buy her present. Erm I only owe eighty pounds don't I? Cos of the twenty that I borrowed Mm. at the start of the month. Mm. Yeah . Stupid dog. He ignored that. Good boy. He didn't even look . I went to the doctors today. Oh yes? Yeah. He said don't buy any more new clothes. He said what? Don't buy any more new clothes. She said I was A hypochondriac? terribly overweight. What made her say that I wonder. And she would like me to go to the well women's clinic every Wednesday it's run. And she would like me to go, book in for an appointment. And she would discuss my diet amongst other things. Oh dear. Mhm. Which diet? Your chocolate diet? Your crisp diet or your food diet? Hm! Er Or the the meals in between diet. If if I'm on a diet you lot will be on diets. on diets We know all about it. but there will be no more cake. We know. I think I'm gonna have to change us all to Flora. Just buy me butter. I get no help and encouragement do I? I shan't encourage you to eat my butter. Hey you, I buttered that bread for you and you didn't eat it. I can't mum, I'm full. nice cup of tea. These people that have to listen to these tapes you know, they must get terribly bored mustn't they? I dunno. I suppose it can be quite entertaining. Yeah I should think so, yeah. Mm? I suppose it can be quite entertaining sometimes. Mm. Wait till Trish gets in. Then it will liven up. It's sure to. Er I I suppose it's to see how people use the English language. What words we use, what words aren't used. What slang we use. We use all the words of the English language don't we? We use the yellow ones, the blue ones, the black ones. I wonder how they'd get on with somebody with foreign? George is, George is gonna get me some lights for on here, did you know? Who? George. He's gonna get me glass? No, lights. Oh lights. George ? Yeah. Mm. He makes them. Well Lynwood do them. Oh? So the next time he goes he's gonna get some for me. Oh does George work for the Lynwood? What do you th what do you think He does he does ma a lot of manufacture for Lynwoods. Oh. What do you think of having in here artexed or airtexed or whatever it's called, artex. Yeah, good idea. But we're not spending any money. Yeah. I think Jean said, well she watched the others do it. They only did like erm a square foot every time. Erm you have to do, put it on and then design it. And then move over to the next square. Put it on, design it she said because it dries very quickly. Mm. It's only like a plaster of paris stuff isn't it? It does go off quick. Mm that's right. Quick. She said it's er about ten pound a tub but I don't know how far a tub would go? Not very far. Mm. And then she said there was stuff called textured paint that has, it's like paint with lumps in it. I think it's just lumpy paint gone wrong and then and they sell it. But then she said you get erm you put it on and you get a brush and er not a brush, a roller. And the roller has a design, a line on it. Different designs. That's right yeah. And then you just roll it on. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Said Debbie's used that in her house. It could definitely do with something. But we'll leave it for now. Mm. When, when he was in I saw he I saw Mark look at that corner. Mm. And he copped off. That one there? Yeah. It's skew-wiff. What does it come out does it? Goes in. Ah so I see, yes. Goes in about an inch. Mm. Mm. He was saying to me it was very difficult to do. Well I can't understand why. I mean really what he should have done if it, if it was that difficult he should have gone back another half a brick and the j bricked it up all the way Mm. level, instead of putting bits and pieces in. Surely Yeah. he could have half bricked it all the way up? Mm. Instead of saying how difficult it was putting bits and pieces in. I would have thought that's what I would have done. You know, just come straight up with a row of bricks. Logical thing to do. Yeah. That's what I thought. I mean it didn't have to be spot on. As long as it came back out to where it is now. Ah. Good boy. The dog was lying there last night and Patricia said something to him, I don't know what she said to him but the look on his face. You could tell it really upset him, whatever she said to him. Yeah. She she wouldn't tell us what she'd said to him either, so it must have been bad. But did you fart? He probably farted. Oh yeah well. Rick. You cheeky. Good boy boys. Cos we're talking about you. Go to sleep now. Good boy. Close your eyes. That's it. Close your eyes and go to sleep. Go on go on. Go on. You soft animal. He won't close his eyes in case you do something to him. Yeah. In case he see in case he misses something. What are you going out now? Yeah. I was gonna wash the car. I'll do it tomorrow. I've never Hey mum seen it so dirty. just think this time next week you'll have me new car for me. Yeah it's my birthday present. Eh? Top of me list. It's not on it's not on the list. You're not having it. . Number one A Forget it. You're too late now, you've made the list. Oh! You are slow. Mm. Do do do do How many tapes do they expect you to fill up John? I don't know. As many as are full up. Whether it be one, two ten fifteen, it doesn't matter. And what why do you have to fill in the form? Erm every time you use a tape you fill in this is tape side B tape one side B tape two side A tape two side B. Oh. So we're still on side one? No we're on one side B. We've done side A. Is it full? Yeah. When, what was the date we started recording on the tape? Was it Saturday? What date was last Saturday? Dunno John. Fourteen fifte fourteenth? That bloke didn't come on Saturday, he come on Friday didn't he? No, well What, why have you put down that you have your regional accent and I have an Irish accent? I haven't. Well, you can't tell that I'm Irish but I can tell you're Irish. Oh. How can you do that? I I . You're you're a frigging idiot you are. How do you know that people can't tell you're Irish? Nobody can. Nobody can tell that I'm Irish. Only when I swear. And you know I don't swear very often. No. Erm kids anyway. But that could change when Patricia comes in. And what does erm why does Brian and Patricia not have a regional accent? Well I don't think they have. Think a brummie accent. They haven't got a brummie accent, no. No. And th th they haven't got a twang as far as I know anyway so Mm. I'm only putting the truth down as I see it. Yeah. You know? I mean I could be wrong. I can only put down what I know to be the truth as far as I can tell. Mhm. There doesn't seem to be a regional accent in this area does there? If you start going further towards Worcester, Worcestershire. Into Worcester The black country. That area. that that area. Well, into Hailsowen Wales. Mhm. places like that, then you would get an accent. I suppose it's too much of a mixture up here isn't it? Mhm. But I don't look at Birmingham people Who? The girl next door. when Brian ? Thought he'd be but he wasn't. kids . Out. You'd better eat that food. I've seen you know the, the coat she brought home first of all? I've seen a lot of people up town wearing that coat, but they were all much older. I would have said they were in their forties. Yeah. You know, mutton dressed as lamb. Yeah. Wearing that type of coat. But Yeah. that one that she brought home does look decent. Right I'll move the car then, out of his way. Well switch your tape off. Oh you've been to see him? Yeah. Who's that? And er he he suddenly looked up and went it's Brian! Like this and the and the pliers dropped out of his hand. Ah! Like this he was. It was really funny. And did Janet come out? Janet came out and went hello, ooh. Got in her car and drove off. Off to the chinese. the chinese. And er She hasn't changed. And Greg, Greg goes oh let me sit on it! Oh! So, Greg was impressed. What car's he got? A Chevette. A Chevette. What year? T, same as mine. How much did he pay for his? Four fifty. No. No it was three seven five. Three seven five he paid for it. Yeah. I thought Janet's own car, I thought they gave it to Greg's brother? The Escort? They did. No, it wasn't an Escort he had out there the other day was it? That old beat up thing. That was several years ago. That was er an Ital he had out there. Oh. And what's and Janet driving now? Sierra. Sierra. Yeah. Sierra. And Jan's got a a new Mini. Oh. H reg Mini. Mm. Which She must be doing well now. which er which Emma's allowed to drive. Oh right, yes. But not Greg? But er Greg's got his own car. Is she still in Dixons? Think so. Mm. Oh she work in a Dixons? Mm. What full time? Yeah. Yeah, the estate agents I think. Oh the estate agents. Yeah she she left school and went straight into Dixons. Oh I see. And Janet wasn't impressed at all. No. Janet had high hopes for . Yeah. But er I think You can do well in that job though. You can be er kidnapped and all sorts. Eh? You can do well in that job. You can be kidnapped and all sorts. Yeah. And then we could always send Brian out to be the motorbike dispatch rider couldn't we? Yeah, so I mean I haven't really done that where, where did I ride to? Where else did you go? I went down to Greg's and I went round to Rob's to see how his interview went. And what was his interview for? For Rover. Oh. He's coming to Rover this year. Robert . He's just finished, well he's taking his exams in twelve weeks. Mm. A levels are in twelve weeks time. And will he just go in as an apprentice the same as yourself? He will go in the same as myself. But he'll be a year behind you? He'll be a year behind me, and he'll be on the same money as me. Oh right. Because he's done his A levels, oh. So he doesn't lose out there. His dad is also a manager down at erm Cowley I think . Mm. His dad does a lot of travelling. And erm Mm it must be at Cowley cos Connolly's virtually closed now. Yeah. And er What department's he in? I've no idea. Dunno. I know he's got a it's er it's one of the craft sections cos he's got craft apprentices under him. Oh. And how, how did his interview go? A lot of them have you know. He hasn't had it yet. He's had the test. Mm. But he's got the interview next week he thinks. Oh yeah is that did you tell him about the test? No, he'd already had it. Oh. Because er it come as a bit of a shock to you didn't it? Er Yeah. He he goes I'd no idea it was so hard. He said it was so difficult. Think it was a real shock for him. Yeah. And erm we er I gave him a few tips on what to revise on Yeah. for the interview. You know the cos they always ask you the maths rules. Th they will pick on something that you're good at. You know. And say if you do have a bit of knowledge on it. No I just told him to revise the er the cycle of the engine. Oh. And who erm Suck squeeze bang blow. who else did you go and see? Then I went down to see Andy. You know the one with the ginger hair? Ah yeah. And he come out with the same expression on his face. Oh yeah. Er! Oh motorbike! Yeah. He goes I don't believe it. He goes I now hate you. He hasn't been round for a while, Andy, has he? No well, you see Andy's got himself a A girl? a an older woman. Well older she Is that the one that rung Patricia? She's a year older. No. Which one was that? Simon. Oh. He's alright. Mm. I think, is in the er garage? Think so yeah. And then I, then I popped down to see James. Oh James has a bike doesn't he? No, that's Simon. That's Simon well, he's got rid of it. He's got a Mini now. a Mini. And James like your bike then? He went whoa! Big! Oh right. So you've done the rounds tonight then Brian? I've done the rounds tonight, yeah. Have you much petrol left? Loads. Loads. I filled it I put six pound on, put six pounds in on Friday and I've got loads left. And I've been all round the place. You'll have to go round Did you go for your gauge then? No. No. You'll have to go round visit your Aunt Bridie. Er Put her in an early grave? Yeah. Oh I couldn't do that to her. Tell her you've come to take her to the ol the pensioners' club on her, on your bike. Yeah. Come on, jump on. She might get on it as well. I've been ever so tired. Yeah. I tell you what did wake me up though John. Coming down the er the old church highway towards the house from town er the white arrows in the road You've gotta keep off them. I found that out. You what? You know the white arrows in the road? The white the white lines Mhm. and manhole covers. You've gotta find out where they are. What about them? Yeah. I've gotta memorize where they are from now on. Why? The white lines and the arrows in the middle of the lane. Why? They make you change your line. Because I went over it Mm and skidded? doing about sixty and I felt a twitch in the wheel and I thought shit! I'm not going over one of them again. Mm. Well you have to sometimes. You'll get used to it and it doesn't affect you I suppose it a bit? after a bit. But you've got to watch them when they're, when you're in the wet. I was I was, I was slightly banked at the time. Mm. Just very slightly. You w if your d wheel does move it won't move far. You get used to that, the wheel moving over a bit. I suppose er it's a trick not to over correct? It will stop itself. It will, it just might slide a bit but it will stop sliding when it comes off it. Yeah. Cos by the time you you've felt it you've passed it maybe? Well you you've travelled another hundred yards. Yeah. I er I suppose you have to be very careful er and find out what is on the road? But like tomorrow when I go to work Keep away from the kerbs. That's the most important thing. Yeah. I ride in the middle of the lane. Tomorrow when I go to work on it, I'm going through er I'm not gonna go through Bowgreen I don't wanna go that way. go that way . Well you can go straight up to Longridge Lane. I'll go straight through Longridge Lane. That way. Yeah. There's a lot, there's Up to Gr Gravelly Corner Yeah it's up Are you going over to Droitwich on it or will you go in your car? I'll go to Droitwich on it, yeah. Mm. And then coming back here to get changed or what? I've I've booked the whole morning off. Well I I p I personally think When you gotta go Droitwich? you would you would need Tomorrow morning. Oh tomorrow. I personally think you would need Well the weather forecast is dry anyway. more experience dri riding on the bike as it is, without erm having your rucksack and things on. Get used to carrying it. Mm? Get used to carrying it. It it didn't bother me at all. I'm not kidding you, it did I didn't feel it. I could feel a slight pressure on me shoulders, but it didn't restrict my movements in any way. When? When I was c coming back with the boots in them. In it. On Saturday. Mm. Well, just be very careful. And don't get over cocky. And keep away from big lorries. Yes mum. I fully intend to keep away from them anyway. I mean a bit of fear is a good thing. Erm, I'm still scared every time I pull away. You know,ji little jitterbugs. Yeah. And I went up Iver Road as well. On a bike? O o on the way back from Andrew's, yeah. I always found that awkward at the top. Yeah. Specially if there was cars on the hill and I had to pull up behind them. Cos you you run out of you know, what things to do. Cos you've gotta have one foot on the ground and you've gotta have one o ha foot, one on the brake Yeah. one on the clutch, one on the throttle Yeah. and the other one on, and your gear change. You're one missing. Yeah . Yeah you I'd just get off and push it . On Iver Road? Whoa! Down he goes. But luckily there was only a c only one car stopped at the top. So I just stopped dead and did a hill start. Stopped at the top and did another hill start. Plymouth Road's another awkward one. The first, the first down bit when you're going down Plymouth Road. Oh yeah, I bet. When you come to the right, the bend. Cos it's actually quite s , quite sharp bend. And it gets wet down there as well. It gets a bit slippy on there. And there's manhole covers as you come out the bend. And don't go don't go speeding Brian. You don't have the same control over a bike when you're speeding. You don't have the same control over a car It or a bike when you're speeding. It feels better, going slow. Cos it's more comfortable. Yeah. Your 's Yeah. better. When I say un slow, under fifty. You know when you, when you think that police rider Go at a speed you can enjoy it. Mm? Go at a speed that you can enjoy riding it at. Yeah. That's it. I mean the police riders look as if they're enjoying it. And and where people can recognize me. Mm? Where people can recognize me. That's it. Hey look there's Bri. Look at him go. Brrr And it will last you longer, you know? Yeah. Your bike, the engine, the oil. You reduce it's life. It's ever so good at the er cruising though. It's really nice. It should cruise along at about fifty at, you know, quarter throttle. Fifty it does about er three and a half, four thousand R P M. Yeah. It's about right for a four hundred. Mine would be doing about five grand at that. Four and a half, five. Mm. Mine went up with, you know let's face it if I was doing sixty mile an hour it would be doing just over six grand. Yeah. Anything over that, you know mine is going up towards the seven into the red. The red on that's about ten. Yeah. And mine did and mine's only a, mine was only a sm you know one eight five . Yeah. I haven't had it above er above about eight grand I think. That was when I wound it up on a carriageway. Don't, just keep your revs down. Hello Rick. You poor tired little boy. Cos erm Greg came down the other night. Did I tell you? When you were in Wales? He came No. he came down. To sh show me his car. Oh. How long has he had his car? Er he had a he had a Polonaise Oh right. before that. Ooh! I mean that's the pits. Bet he, he didn't wanna show that to anybody. No. He didn't that. But er and he got this little Chevette. Apparently he blew the Polonaise up. Everybody does, don't they? Yeah. Er he's bought his little Chevette and er it's a nice little car. Mm. Bit noisy but it's alright. Is it yellow or green? Red. Oh a red one! Oh yeah. Quite decent. He loves it. He's got all these plans for it. Bore it out to a fourteen eighty and Load of rubbish. Right. Thank you Brian. And make it last about six months. Or six thousand miles Do you want one? whichever comes first. No. No. Just give me a fiver. Haven't got a fiver. I'll go and er bring me bike in. Get me stuff ready for tomorrow. Hello. And, do you want a wee? Rick. Do you want a wee? Tell me what you want? Come here. Do you want a wee wee? Don't you cheek Don't eat the microphone Rick. You cheeky . T that's it, walk all over me. You cheek The gloves are good. Yeah? Gloves are, gloves are really good. They, not as like warm as yours but er they're certainly nice and warm. Yeah. You need good gloves Yeah. cos see once your hands get cold you've gotta give up. And now, now I'm wearing the scarf the er the cold doesn't go down. My er my adam's apple gets cold but that's about it. Do you want me to put the sound on? Yeah. I haven't seen him yet. Oh you haven't seen him. But she said to me, she goes er last Friday night she was ten pounds down. Yeah? And she's been working there eight years. Yeah. So it does happen. Oh yeah it happens, yeah. It's very hard to balance a till. Yeah. She says you get new ten pound notes, they stick together and you count them as one. She says that is the most common one. Yeah. It could have been there all the time. Yeah. And you missed it you see? And as for being six pound up, she says I must have short-changed someone . Yeah. Come on, you're losing your touch now. Come on, give me a kiss. Go on. Quick, quick quick quick. Good boy Go on. Get it Rick. Go on. Hey! Kiss. And me. Give me one. Give me a kiss. Kiss. Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. If you don't kiss, kiss Rick Rick Rick Rick Hey. Oh thanks Rick. You put it on there? Yeah. Well I've left you three tapes out to take with you. When? Now. Oh this morning? Yeah. I mean it's a good opportunity. You might as well get it used up. See it's having a pocket What are you looking for? It's having a pocket to put it in to. Does it have a clip on the back? Yeah. It can clip on to your trousers. Yeah. everybody? Where is everybody? Oh we're first by the look of it. Oh dear. Well almost first anyway. Haven't you? Oh Mary was late up. There was a right panic in our house. How come? Well I, I got up late and Brian was in the bathroom. Had to rush downstairs, do my breakfast. Had some Weetabix quick and a cup of tea. Rush rushed into the bathroom. Went in there and went and got dressed so Mary was up then so when I got back downstairs the er breakfast, my breakfast was on the table. Again. So all in all, it's quite exciting. You all looking forward to this? Yeah. Yes I am. I said to Sue I said I can't ring and tell him I ain't going I says, I'll upset him too much. I think I'd have if you was to say that. at least plus or minus point O five. Yeah. Right. Which is a big percentage that you're And both of these could be out. One could Yeah. be too big and one could be too small, which would make a big difference. But you can measure the angle pretty accurately on that to s to within say half a degree and have its tan. Right yeah . Erm because there's your angle,there's that, and this is opposite over adjacent. So the gradient it's a ratio it's not no units to it, not metres millimetres or anything else, and it's the tan of the angle. So the gradient gives you a mea If I gave you the gradient, if I said the gradient is one, what would the angle be? Erm How would you find the angle? Just one and then do the tan backwards. Okay tan to the minus one . five. So there's a that's that's what gradient means, the tie-up between them. It's not In some cases like erm the diagram you were doing about the two girls running,erm then the distance against time gradient will give you speed, give you velocity. We've done the Roses,you're okay on the symmetry, you know about that now. Yeah. I mean if if it hadn't got a ,there's noise in the problem there's Yeah. irrelevant stuff. If you if you you strip it down to the Actually I didn't know how to do the arc . I wasn't sure how to do that. Okay. But you know now. Erm That was pretty st that the height of just a bit of It's a bit of algy and a bit of pythagoras Yeah. in together. And the area. What is how about that one? What is the square root of six point four by ten to the ten to the five? Well erm eight hundred but when I did it wrote it into normal terms like six point sixty four with one two three four noughts Mm. and then I square rooted it. Mm. Erm yeah, I square rooted it. Okay. Yeah that's a good way to do it. Mm slightly more easier for you is just multiply it by one of those tens so you've got sixty four by ten to the four. The square root of sixty then take the square root of Eight. The square root of the sixty four is eight, the square root of the ten to the four ten squared. Oh right yeah. Yeah. Erm okay. It's a good way to do it to if you think, Oh I can't really handle this going on here, put all your noughts on and then you can work out what they come to. Okay. Erm weather stations near the north pole. we should start ringing alarms bells a little bit. So what did you do for this one? Right I measured well it's seven kilometres apart so I measured the distance between them. Ah. Mm? Erm in centimetres or millimetres . And it came to five. It wasn't seven centimetres eh ? No so it's And it should have been shouldn't it? fifty millimetres. Right. Okay, so you worked out what the scale was. Yeah. And then what did you do? Erm I so it was for one So seven kilometres is equal to fifty millimetres. Mhm. I did erm Yeah. So you seven work out your scale that comes to So seven over five. And then what did you do for this next bit? It knows it's between four and three kilom kilometres away. Yeah. So er point seven one er is equal to one kilometre. Mhm. So work out the Yeah. So four kilometres so multiply point seven one by four. Yeah. You worked out what that would be and then on the one the scale and then what did you do ? Yeah I worked out what this would be on the scale. that's from T so I dr drew a line a cir a circumference . A circle. Right. So I did round there. Yeah. and a smaller one round there. Right. So you work out . what the scale is so you can set your radius and draw your two circles and say, It's in there somewhere. Yeah. Okay. That should get full marks. Yeah. Bit . Mm. Erm er that trig trigonometry there again. Mhm. And then er just work out the length of this and then the length of that and then subtract these two lengths. So that's quite a nice question. Erm Seven marks on that. Okay. Transformation. You alright on the transformation? Yeah. Yeah. You've been doing those alright haven't you . . Ah. Mm. How many of those can you get out of one of those eh? Erm How many mugs of water to fill the tank? . Okay. So you cal calculate the volume. Yeah. That one's no problem. Yeah. You think, Right I've done that with me fish tank. That one. What did you do for that? Erm I used the equation sheet which he wri wrote on the board. Right. Okay which would have been on the front of your paper . Yeah but he we didn't have any Right so as soon as you see that you think, Ah volume of a cylinder, I know, whee! straight to the front. Look at it and then erm measured it I did I d and then I redid this one and put it in the same scale, Yeah. and then erm the answer I got for this Mm. So divided it by that. you what did you you used centimetres here did you? Yeah. Right. Good. Because that thing you did with the fish tank has shown Yeah. you that you can't say, Well one centimetre is a hundredth of a metre so No. one cubic centimetre's going to be a hundredth of a cubic metre. it's obvious. It's not it might be obvious but it's not true. Okay that that's the big thing they're looking for there. Convert it to the same units, use the formula and then I mean that's a gift that isn't it? Yeah. Mm? Six marks there for nothing really. Imagine them all bringing their mugs to fill the tank . Mm. Now you've got to rework it again in cubic metres Yeah. and work out how many seconds. There's nine marks on that Yeah. really a gift wasn't it? Yeah I mean it's a it would be a joy to do it as well cos you think, I know how to do these. Yeah isn't this easy, this is relaxing. Okay. Erm I think you know there how to pick up quite a few Quite a few more marks yeah. quite a few marks without you learning anything No. that you don't know already. Yeah? Yeah It's just sort of looking at 'em a bit. Erm the geometry one that we didn't look at,you might be able to spot it in minutes, Yeah. you know seconds even. You might be still on it twenty minutes later. Yeah. So keep it for the end and keep it for when you've not only done all the questions but had a quick check through to see have Yeah. you done something daft. Yeah. Cos that's where the marks are thrown away. Not Yeah. not something you can't do but something you've done ten times before. You just make a one silly mistake like. And you just think you know you like you've put metres instead of centimetres on the the hosepipe or something like that and you think, Oh that's not right, that you will spot . Like when you write a letter and you read it through and you think, Ooh I've missed a word out here, Mm. or I've you know run two words in together or something. So that few minutes at the end is important for picking up these extra marks you've been trying to throw away,okay, where you can do it, and the few minutes at the beginning is to look through and find that question wherever it was, that one on the last page. Lot of marks going for it, dead ea And again it's a s it's a joy to do this sort isn't it. Yeah. Cos you can see where you're going all the way through, Yeah. you know that you know it it's nice It's just like nice and easy. and you feel really confident about it, you think, Wow this is piling up the marks . So look for the good ones don't spend too much t There'll only be one little geometry thing Yeah. fiddling about with triangles and circles and stuff like that. So have a go And it's only about two or three five marks. Exactly. So have a go at it when you've done the others. Okay. Well I'd better get off. another one to get to soon. That's mine. That's yours. Right. Practise with that protractor, Yeah. so that you get used to it so that you prefer to use it to the other one. Have have have both , but if you've got bearings It easy to b better . use that . If someone gives you a polygon to draw Yeah. Use that cos it's not not fiddling Yeah. around twisting it. I mean in the time is takes you to do a sketch you can draw accurately Be easier to . draw round it,dot dot dot,draw even if you then sketch it without using a straight line, if you just join up the dots freehand , Yeah. you get a very good sketch and you can see what's going on and you can see the angles. . That's your one. Erm Next week. What's happening about that? Where are we ? I'm on holiday then so er You're on holiday. Right. Yeah. Okay. So is that for What about the week after that?

Well now, what can I do for you today? I've been coming for sh three weeks now. And I came to ask the doctor if I could get H R T. And she took my blood pressure and it was too high She chased you. so she didn't give me anything the first time, but she Mhm. The second time. The second time, it was a different doctor again, and she gave me tablets and I can't remember the name. It was I just took the last one on Saturday, and I then threw the Aye. The wee white ones, Aye. Right. Brusc something Aye. So Right. Show us your muscles. Let's see what you're doing to your poor old self. I don't know why I think maybe the, the tablets helped, but erm I was saying I was kind of having second thoughts whether I was wanting to go on the H R T or No. No. No chance. No chance. Not, not with your blood pressure up like that. No er well she didn't say much, but she Well, no chance I can tell you now. Whenever er Just get yourself down. And I thought er and er I had wee tablets that you gave me a while ago,Brusdeximit Mhm. And I was wondering maybe if I'd be better going back on them. Aye, you'd be safer a lot safer on them. And they won't er they won't fight with your blood pressure. Here just let your arm . On second thought, it'd be . Aye. It's, it's amazing how many folk come up to see about it, and they, they decide eventually not to. Doing fine. You're fine but you'll need to stay on your wee tablets I'm afraid. And er I think you can forget the H R T. I will, I felt maybe er when I came up to see, oh I was having all these heavy sweatings. Just was it was really Mhm. Mhm. pain up sore back, so. And Falling to bits. to bits . then I had another I had another wee problem that I'd been, I had been to see, and it was Doctor I had been, and the doctor that I saw the last time er I had three big bruises on my back, and she Mhm. says I don't know what this is. But this was a wee sort of lump that I had down at the bottom of my vagina. Right. I don't know whether you would call it a lump or not, I said to her it was like a wee spot. Mhm. So she, she says well I don't know what that is, she says. So I'll send you to the hospital. So I've to go on Yeah. Friday to see Right. Doctor . Right. Now have you got plenty of the wee tablets or are you finished? No, I finished 'em. Finished all that lot. Right, Agnes. Finished them on Saturday. Mm That's how I was, I was saying had been at the hospital, come back and says no, my No. tablets are finished, I'd better go to the doc No, you'd better. You need to get that, need to keep that down because if you do go to the hospital, and they did decide to take that out, they would ne d they would check your blood pressure and they would chase you. There's no way they would touch it at all. So It's no, I don't really know cos the doctor says she didn't know what it was either. Doctor seen it first, she thought I had pulled a hair and it was kind of septic Septic Aye. and she gave me tablets, Aye, that leaves antibiotics. leaves a wee cyst underneath the skin. Is that what it would Mhm. be then? Yeah, that's probably what it is. It it's no really er giving me any No. Just, no. much trouble or anything , but it was just the fact of it being there. It's there. It's there. And it's always a worry when you don't know what's going on. And the trouble is it can turn septic again, and put the whole thing sky high again. But s what about your Dixevit Are you needing any more of them? I haven't got them. I've no I haven't Nothing? been taking them Oh well. for ages and ages. Keep some in the house in case you do get a bad spell. Because they're s they're safe. Would it no be similar to kept taking Dixevit instead of the other ones Doctor ? No. No? No, they wouldn't affect your Wouldn't do anything wouldn't affect your pressure. No. They wouldn't affect your pressure. They're very they're good and they have very few side effects, this is the beauty Aha. of the Dixevit they keep the flushings down, Aye. and they don't affect your blood pressure. Aye. So, stick with them, if, if you're having a bad time, use them. If you don't leave them be. Leave them be. But keep on your wee white ones every morning, Agnes. One at breakfast time, Aye, er I er oh well I took them, took them regular, because Aha. you gave me only thirty, Yes. and that was enough. That's right.

See how the boy takes Zantac Doctor , is there two strength of Zantac Mhm. And he's Yeah. getting the lesser one do you think? Would it be advisable for him to get the higher one? Er He's with the, with the bigger strength you only take one, they only allow you one a day. Mhm. He doesn't really, I think at the moment he takes one and er he doesn't sort of take them like Mhm. constantly or er when he gets the heartburn Er that's sort of thing that's he takes Aye this is this is the very strong one.

Busy today is it not? we just don't believe it. about an hour I've been out there. Oh aye. I can believe it. Due a line today are you? Yes Doctor. I've been sitting here since two o'clock my two o'clock cup of coffee. Not very funny Doctor. I wasn't expecting you'd be that busy just now. Oh. Holidays. Never come at holiday weekend. Mhm. Always the same, before the Christmas, before New Year. It doesn't matter. I mean you can go up on the rest of the week, but the day before the holiday and the day after the holiday the Closed on Monday? Aye. Well you'll get a day off there eh? Or do you? Are you on call-out work? No. I've just got a big case full of paperwork to do when I get There's no rest ? Ah no. Keeps me out of mischief. I'll just be betting horses or chasing women or something like that. Oh you'd better do the last one Doctor it saves you money. If you bet on horses or drink then it cost you money. And that's not . Oh I don't know. I don't know. When you're ready what would be what things will we shall we start with? Well erm sort of how how you how you became involved in the erm in the strike. In the strike, are we starting off with this stuff? Yes. Not now? Yes now. Oh. Well we started off and we were working for . And we and then we had been working for him for about ten or eleven years on this contract that he had for us. And erm his son came along to take over from him. And he put a new table in the mill. And erm being as he put a new table in the mill he thought we could work for thirty pound a week less, on this table. And we could produce more slate on erm thirty pound a week less in wages. Well none of the lads were prepared to take that on, cos we'd been on this contract with for the last eleven years. And was quite happy and all the workers was happy until this son came along . And that's what's got us fixed in all this trouble. You said that you'd worked erm quite happily for er t t Oh yeah everybody was happy. Yeah. Aha. Can you give me some idea of erm h how you started up with him in the first place? Well he bought this slate quarry to scrap it. I believe he er didn't give much for the quarry. But somebody put him on there was slate to be had, only a if you had a machine to clear. And he started clearing to get this slate, and he got at the slate quite quick. But we were working for him then for fourteen pound a week. And make preparing the mill ready for the slate. To ma make putting fixing new tables in and that. And erm anyway we got more from the unemployment exchange that prepared to work for him for fourteen pound, when we could have a eighteen pound on the dole. Four pound a week more on the dole, cos we were having elected earnings and tax rebates on the dole and it and it made it up to eighteen pound. And we were working for for fourteen pound at that time. I sup erm at that time was there a a a a lot of men who had work in the quarries Well on the dole? Well everybody that was working for him had always worked in the quarries all their life, and they er they just been working for the slater company before the quarry shut down. And that's the time they were put off work when the quarry, of the why the quarry shut it, they had too much expense on the electricity to pump the water from this from the mine. That's why er the quarry shut. Or the quarry would have carried on with this slate mine. How many p people d di did he take on at that time then, when he first took over ? There was about six to start with. How did he select them? Well he knew they were all slate quarry workers, and that's how he went on to them. He knew they were all slate quarry workers and they were prepared to work the slate again. Every one of them. Were they were they men who had erm a l lot of expertise in in in the slate? Yes all their lives you know they'd worked. We've all worked in these slate mines since we left school. I I left school before the war when I was fourteen, we all went in the slates. Cos everybody was working in the slate then. Hundreds of men working in the slates. My fathers and grandfathers all worked in the slate, they seen nothing only slate. And when the war broke out of course, everybody left the mines. Cos there was more money else where. We were working for, my father was er earning one pound sixteen shillings a week before the war. When the war broke out that made a world of difference for everybody. The wages stepped up. I went into erm aer aerodrome you know be we were having working seven days a week and we were having seven pound a week. A pound a day and we were millionaires weren't we? Aye millionaires. Only because the war broke out. Yes. And then from there, in nineteen forty three, I was called up. And was going back to twelve and six a week after, to the forces. And I wasn't long in this country they shoved me over, Normandy, on the landing in Normandy. And all I got for that was a couple of tin medals, uh uh, aye dear Aye. When you er when started up again, opened up the the quarry. Yeah. Can you tell me all the sort of work that you were al er engaged in? Well to prepare the mill, we were erm concreting and or doing knocking all the old tables down and preparing get the er big saw table in, you know to diamond saw table in to cut the slate up. Erm or any other little fork lift there which the quarry belonged then. And was on to us, he only had four thousand five hundred that's all the money he had, that's all I've got four thousand five hundred. And believe me in a couple of weeks after we got the slate for him. We had a new fork lift, we had tools galore, everything was coming in. There must be money in slate. And in no time after that built a massive big bungalow for himself. He had a brand new Mercs. Every money was coming in everywhere. From a poor man he didn't half step up. Aye in no time, cos there must be money in slate Aye. Mm. Yes he stepped up, right diddly me. And then his son they had a Mercs each, and he's built a new bungalow now in they've all got massive big places, it's fantastic the money they made out of it. And this is what they ga ga done with the lads in the end. Just shoved them off, put them on the dole,and there was some young lads that I I wasn't worried myself, cos I I'm in my sixties, but there was lads there with mortgages and kids. He didn't think of them either eh. There's lads of real trouble there, but there was lads you know young lads with kids and mortgages and and we had er he I'm sixty all your worries are over aren't they. But there are young lads there. What he didn't worry about them either he didn't care who who went, just that he we he had his own way. W w when you were starting off aga when you were starting off with erm was there any sense in that you were all including him involved in a joint enterprise to g g g g get the quarry really being profitable? Well what he said to us, if I go up we go up together, he said. If I make money I I'll make you I can pay you as well, if I go up I mean if I go down, he said, I can go up or down as well , he said. That's what he said, and he kept on saying he had only four thousand five hundred pounds or something, that's all the money he had, he was on about that all the time. But he he didn't half make money cos he had nothing before that. He had that coal business, but no money, he had no money there. But that slate quarry put him on his feet all right. W w w why do you think his approach t t to the extraction of slate was successful. Where as the previous owners had erm had great problems with f fl fl flooding? Well he worked the slates from outside you know. They were all slate there, the old new there was slate there, but they weren't prepared to get the machines to clear it, at it. Where as he bought these machines and cleared up the rubbish to get at the slate. Cos the lads knew where the slates was, and it wasn't far from the surface. There was plenty of slate there but he he just slate mines wouldn't pay t to get these machines, and course this grant story this had you know millions of pounds of grants for these machines and that. We know he had fantastic grants, we know how much he had, you know when we went on this strike. We got to know all the money he had from these grants to get all these machines and all these. Every penny he was paying he was having grant for it from the government Aye. Where you aw aw aw a a aware of that you were in a a b business that was succeeding when you were working for him? Oh yes, we everybody knew of that of the slate we were making, you know cos erm we were making about two thousand duchess a day. What In twenty four fourteens and twenty t twenty two hours an this fantastic you know, the slate cos it was good slate there. And there's no contract to start with, the first year or two there was no contract at all. And we had terrible job getting a contract off him. He wouldn't give a contract and he wanted us to work like on the, make plenty of slate but he wouldn't you know, he wasn't prepared, thee to pay. But we did manage to get the contract from him after. But he wasn't prepared to give a contract to start with. Out of all the slate mines, of all the years that has gone I've always worked on a contract. That's been the bo the system of these slate mines. There was used t the work in the old days, there was used to be two underground and two in the mill, they used to be partners. The the lads underground used to send the blocks up, and the lads in the mill used to make produce the slates out of them, and they were all partners these four. And there was hundreds of contracts like that in the quarry, everybody was on their own for t thing, you know. Not one big contract but everybody on their own little contracts. Four four men in each contract, that's how they were. That's how they carried it out in the old days, in every quarry. But in this quarry now in when we were working for everybody was on the same bonus, you know they was they were all partners. Everybody in the erm in the er on the slate face and everybody in the mill were partners, everybody. Get the same wages not like the old days then, they were all individual partners then in four you know, in each partner work working. When you came to get your your contract with er te te te and you were all in the same c contract, was that because you got together as a union, or whether you got t together as the worker? Oh we were all together, and the union was behind us, you know the union was with us. Even in that early day? Oh yes, we had the union with us all the time, from the start you know. Everybody paid the union then, aye everybody was a union man there. But erm you know when we were on the strike if these lads wouldn't have gone back, there was couple of scabs went back into the quarry. It's them that made it worse for the others, if everybody had a stayed up together, and and stayed out, we we everybody had the same troubles, money trouble. Cos there was youngsters there who that stayed out with us, they had mortgages. And these scabs that went back, well they're the ones that let us down. St D d d do you think you you you would have succeeded? Oh yes, if everybody would have stayed out they would never had a scrap of slate made there, everybody would have stayed out and stayed out till the end, and not a scrap of slate would have been made there. But these scabs went back and made slates, and there was erm two officials there, they they'd never made slate when we were working up there. But when we went on strike they started making slate, so in a way they were scabs too, in these two officials, officials not touched a slate if they were er not making slate before, why should they make slate when we were on strike? D d did they know how to s how to make slate? Oh yeah, well they weren't good slaters as the, you know, but they did produce slate there, but they didn't they weren't good slaters the just that, well they make slate but. If they wouldn't have made a scrap of slate it would have a world of difference to this strike. Not a scrap of slate would have been made there, and he would have had to do something with us then. But these scabs went back and that's what really ruined this strike. Had you any had you any clue at all that they were going to go back? Well yes we had you could see on some of them, they didn't want much to turn them on, you know there was two or three there and they they took some others with them of course then didn't they, you know. If you get one or two that prepared to go the others w drop one by one back then wou that's how they went. But there was two or three there, when the strike started you couldn't trust them, they were scabs from the start. They weren't prepared to stay out. Where they men who had been quarry men? Well no they weren't really, they weren't they hadn't worked in the quarry like like us. They only did they were new to the quarry really. But they were on this bonus system you know, they were you know on the bonus but they weren't quarry men. They didn they ne hadn't been working in a quarry all that long. What sort of work had they erm been engaged in? Well driving and for erm you know he had plant hire, he'd been driving for him and that. That's what they had been doing before. They hadn't been working on the slate face, they hadn't worked any slate, but they were doing all right on the tables, you know on the sawing the slate up for the others. And then you had a couple of scabs, they were slaters, this is one or two of them, they went back. And so with the help of these, they just managed to do a bit of slate, but if them had not gone back, I thinks this this strike would have turned the other way. Stop 'em having any any slate at all, that's what we wanted to do. You stop 'em from any s scrap of slate e . C c can you gi give me some clue now a about w when the penny began to drop that trouble was going to g g going to start? Well no when we started when the strike started in the mill, I told then, you know y I don't know what you are going to do with us, I said, but the way you are carrying on now you are going to bring trouble into this quarry, cos these lads aren't going to give in to you at all that quick, what you're trying to do, make them work for thirty pound a week less, so you better think it over now, I said, before it gets any worse. But he wasn't prepared to do that, he just, he wasn't worried about us. He'd put his mind to it that he wouldn't, you know this he had it in mind that we were going to work for this thirty pound a week less, take it or leave it. He wasn't prepared to do anything else. Wasn't prepared to to let us go on now that same wages as before. How did i it come about that y you were placed in the situation that you were going to get thirty pounds a week less? Well he s all he made a little contract out himself, you know that's what he did, after he he'd put these new tables in the mill. He made a contract then out for us. And we worked on this contract for two month, to try it out for him but we were thirty pound a week less, and we had over two hundred slates a day more, on the on this contract. T we were thirty pound a week less. But nobody was prepared for it, to take it and that's how it was. What w was it about th the new tables that produced the situation? Well these tables he bought, well I hadn't seen tables like that before, he bought them in Italy somewhere. And they were sawing these slates in into blocks, you know sawing them square like into the size of the slate, they were quite handy. But the time involved to saw them was too much. The other table what we had before was better, was no much so much time involved, by the time you'd screw them round and turn 'em, to saw them into blocks there was a lot of time involved in it. Cos we're loosing a lot on 'em. But they were handy when you had them sawed, cos they were quicker for the slate, I said to er splitter they were quicker then to split 'em up. But we found we were sawing a lot of stuff up, was no good for the slate making, you know it it's got to be good for slate making, a lot of veins and lots of muck in 'em. But the tables were good then but erm too much time involved in them, in in sawing with in them. That's what I found out. W w where they w w once when they'd been installed or was it thought that it a mistake had been made in obviously a lot of cash had been spent on them but erm, was it considered a mis a waste of money or? Well it was a waste well I'll tell you what it was really, he saw a lot of waste on the other tables going on the tip you know, there was a lot of waste going over. Well these tables were doing away with a lot of waste. Getting more slates not so much waste out of them, cos these tables were sawing er them into blocks. There was no what we call, ends on on the slate, you know going over the tip, there was not so much waste with them there as the new tables. Why is it that this machine c c could trim it on all sides? Yeah we used to trim 'em with a hammer and chisel before Yeah. and there was a lot of waste, but these new tables did bring that, it was something for the company it was more than anything, you know cos we were on the bonus system. Slate we wanted to produce we want, you know if there a lot a bit of waste going over the tip, we weren't so much worried bout the waste, cos we was on the bonus we were making the slates and that. But he was worried more about the waste then then ours contract That's what he was cos there was a lot of waste on the old tables, and they make a bit more waste than on these new tables there. Ha ha ha ha how did it come about that you were on you were on one side very firmly and the employers were on the other side very firmly and sides had been had been drawn up? Well I don't think and nobody will turn this you know this he nobody would, he'd put his mind to something and there is nobody on earth that could turn him. Nobody on earth could turn him to do er to er change his mind. And behind him again there was his son-in-law, you know that only he's worse than . Then the one that runs the quarry to us, he's well he's worse only he was behind it in a way, he had he was the one with the brains, he was the one that new how to get the men to work for nothing. He was behind ee he had the brains, and was carrying it out for him, cos erm this erm I dunno if you know him eh, he runs this quarry to us up here. Oh he's terrible there, he even had them he had young girls working for him up there, and they found out they were paying he was paying them too little and then he got caught up with 'em, and erm what he done after he charged for taking them up there in the morning and charged 'em for taking them down in the evening with a Land Rover. So he had them both ways didn't he? He's a terrible man that one. Aye but he was behind the this cos they're all in the in the same boat you know, they're all families, family affair isn't it. But they say the old man didn't have anything to do with it, but I dunno, he could have had something to do with it, I dunno. I I dunno there Can you give some idea of how it came about that you in fact decided strike? When we started well we were in trouble in York When we at then we were going on the go slow system you know, we didn't produce much slate we were on the go work to rule. We let this carry that out for a month or so, and he was very annoyed about it. And then erm the lads in both they had decided they were gonna go on the go slow, but they were told if you go go on the on the go slow system, you're gonna go home, he said, I'm not prepared to carry on with that, he said, the manager there, that's brother that is. When a they were sent home from we went home from this quarry then, and the everybody went home so the the were forty of us in altogether. Everybody went home an, we were all on picket line after. Have you got any idea of w what they thought then of the fact that you were all acting, the three quarries, were acting as erm one body? Well we were all union members, and everybody wanted to be together, if you are if you are in the union well we had to stuck together an the the more we stayed together the stronger we are, to keep out if we can stay out. That's what we always thinking of ain't it. And it was last August, last August Bank Holiday this was started, just before the Bank Holiday weekend when i cos we were all on that gates, Bank Holiday weeks, stopping all the traffic going in there Yea That's how the know is, maybe if we'd a gone back then and,yo you know, if he, he offered us to go back then about September. Yeah to go back to work on this Thursday but we didn't go an all we should have gone then. And tried to get some settlement, but I don't believe it are giving us any settlement cos he wasn't prepared to do anything like that. And I know he had, you know he was stubborn, he wouldn't give in, nobody would he give in to nobody then. He was stupid, stubborn that's what he was. When you first erm when you first came out on strike. Did you have any idea how long you would be out Well everybody thought we'd be out for a week or so, but we were out for a month or er more when these scabs started going back. Well I knew then it was gonna finish off, you know. If more would have gone back then the strike would have come to an end quicker cos, I thought more would have gone back then, but all the lads in they stayed out and nobody went in to work. When the others went back to work, how did you manage to stop anyone else from going back to work? Well all th all these lads that have gone back, they were having a hell of a life in the town of course. If they went for a drink everybody was calling them scabs and if they went anywhere then, some some had their cars sprayed with paint and oh they had everything done, they were all against them. And the still now. The they were scabs then and the scabs now, and they'll always be scabs all their lives now. They will be called scabs wherever they go. Er even e even n now they are marked men yes? Yes they'd like if they were in South Wales, in South Wales you know if your grandfather was a scab, you'd be a scab wouldn't you, they carry it out in generations there. And I believe, in this it's brought a lot of thing in this town there small town like this. Cos these lads now that have gone back, and they were scabs then and they'll scabs they will be all their lives now. Everybody will be looking at them as scabs, wherever they go. No matter what they do they'll always be scabs. No, and as for and I dunno. I suppose they've shot better men than 'em Aye.. Yes Could be. I couldn't have shot any worse I don't think so I don't know what'll happen. Well I'm not worried cos I'm over sixty there, but these lads, I'm worried about these lads, that have mortgages and children to rear up they had lots of worries, and they still have. But these quarry owners they're not worried about them. They just worried about themselves Mm is it rather on the ye yo yo you said earlier on that er the old s s system of striking bargains was on a individual basis? Yes. on, on a team of or a contract of four men. So there's obviously a tradition of people of the quarry men and the quarry owners talking to each other. Yeah. Was the fact that there was no talking going on, completely surprising from the point of view of the tradition of bargaining? Yeah well in the old days, you know everybody was in the union. You couldn't work in the quarry, you couldn't go through the gate in the quarry without being a union man, in the old days there. And there was this system of four men in a bargain, nobody knew the other man's wages, we were all on different wage, everybody was on a different wage. And if you were well in with the staff and the owners of the quarry you'd have more bonus. They'd fix you up with er better bonus, but if you were a black leg they'd er be on less wagers. That's what is was it was a terrible system there, but that was the system, that was the system they carried through the quarries in all the years that are gone. It is contract it's a monthly contract you work for three weeks for one pound sixteen shillings and at the end of the month they count all the slates you've done during the month. And you get this little bonus at the end of the month, maybe a couple of quid on top of your one pound sixteen shillings. That's what they were doing, and then if you made too much slate this month, the following month they'd drop your bonus down, so as to see as to keep you on the same level, so you couldn't go any higher if you if you had good slate and worked your guts out. And the following month they drop you, that's how they used to do it Was there any sense that er you were in fact being put in the same position as your parents had been your your grandparents, had been in in in the sense not being able to get above a certain level by having your wages your bonus cut? Well they I I tell you this they they we'd worked for him for er good many years and there was no talk of any cuts in wages, we had this wages all through the through these years, and everybody was happy with it. Everybody were working on it and everybody was working a g a g a good days work and hard cos slate quarry work has always been hard anyway. But everybody was happy there, and er, till this came along, he's the one that wanted us to work for less. When he came along how could you see things had changed or how could you see in the process of changing? Well straight away the first thing he done was to put these new tables in, and that was his idea when he put these tables in to get more slate, and less wages. I dunno whether he he thought his father paid us too much, I dunno, but erm that's what he had in mind to start with, was drop the wages down thirty pound a week. For everybody. Was there any alteration in the style of management at all? No, not a thing jus we were all working, just on the same, everybody was working,fr real hard but erm. He had that in mind all the time to to cut the wages down, that's what they wanted to do. That's what he wanted to do to from the start, cut the wages down and make more slate, that's what he had in mind. He wasn't prepared to do anything else there no ar and he was he was to have these plant hire, you know these two, when when his old man used to work us us in the quarry, well this was working up there as well, he had lads working on the plant hire for him. He had about a dozen lorries on the road, and machines er working the roads there, all they were working for nothing for him, these lads and he'd come along and before Christmas he'd stop a couple of them, just before Christmas, he used to do that every year. Stop 'em, just before Christmas he used to stop 'em. And my son-in-law he was working with him, and when he had that accident, well it's ridiculous what he done that day. When he reversed that dumper over the tip. Eleven o'clock in the morning, and lost his leg. And he held the wages of the afternoon of him. No I'd r I thought that was really terrible there. Stopping a man's afternoon wages after he lost a leg. Er it was, and he was only paying him twenty two pound a week at the time. Was that considered a hard thing at the time? Very hard, very hard I told the lads I told 'em the union about it what he done that day. Must must be terrible man to do a thing like that eh. And you know is after an accident like that, well, we never, the old slate quarry company wouldn't do that, they'd pay the day off in one a serious accident like that. But that holding the afternoon off him after loosing a leg I think that was really terrible aye. When it became obvious that the strike wasn't going to last a fortnight or it wasn't going to last a month. How did you organize yourselves to stay together? Well we had a meeting every week, a a union meeting, every week. And we had the fantastic help in from South Wales, most thos terribly good er people were terribly good to us in organizing er different things. Many supported us and the present the people. Fantastic I never thought of anything like it, the money was coming in everywhere. They really did help us Aye. W w w w what sort of er p p people or organize or organizations where helping you then? Well union, you know the union in the coal mines and all different well er everywhere in the North Wales here to, postmen, well every union was helping us with them. Organizations and er money coming in everywhere and food parcels. They were helping everybody. I never thought of anything like that, I couldn't believe it. Really fantastic, and there's still money in the fund now, for after it. There was money coming in from overseas, Germany, Belgium, Holland, there wa everywhere helping us. Aye. W w w w were you as erm a large were you organized in any way in ord d er to c con t t t =tinue the strike le le length of time? Well we could a continued it for erm, well I dunno, but erm it was getting a bit out of hand with the picket line really, cos there was a lot of these youngsters who weren't prepared to do these picket line. You know they were coming there this week and they wouldn't come there for three or four weeks or something, thinking with this picket but it was very important to keep that gate, stop everybody from going in there. But there was a lo lots of these youngsters who wouldn't prepared to do this picket business. As they they got fed up with it I suppose I dunno er. But there was no point in carrying it on really you know it. If we'd a carried it on for say this time of the year now you with this erm Whitsun Holiday now, we'd have had to to do it seven days a week, cos you'd have to be there Saturday and Sunday to stop anything going in there . But they weren't prepared to do it were they. You know these youngsters they weren't prepared to stay on that gate. W w w was the the encouragement then for the picket from the older men? Well we c couldn't we had a lot of arguments about it you know in the union meetings about this picket line. But we couldn't make anybody do it, you know they'd say, anyway that we'll do it, there's we live in, it would certainly be a different shape, erm when we had our golden wedding erm our visitors were so numerous that they were standing shoulder to shoulder in these two rooms and the kitchen whereas if it had been a reasonably designed house maybe we could of spread them around a little more, but they're minor, minor defects that are not really serious. I think today that if someone was designing a house one would incorporate all the modern additions which have suddenly become fashionable such as double porches, doubleglazing and er patio windows, I think that these things are perhaps a development from, in the same way as this house is a development from the rooms and the flats we lived in in London so that the modern conceptions of the things I've mentioned could be incorporated as normal in the house certainly would be cheaper to incorporate them when building the house than adding them on. When was this house built? Well I don't know the exact date but I believe this house is some thirty years old, so it was built about nineteen fifty three, fifty two, fifty three Does it have central heating? Does it have central heating? No it has central heating now, but it didn't when we moved in. Did you own the house? No Erm, did the Council put the central heating in? Council put the central heating in when we got advanced in years and when it became necessary in the doctor's opinion for me to have central heating because I had a heart complaint. So it's, the, the Council doesn't install central heating as a matter of course only if it's a special case? The Council has a policy now of bringing all its properties up to date, but priority because they're, bringing the houses up to date will take some eight years, priority is given to elderly citizens and people with medical needs. Do you like the orientation of the house? Do you feel that it's pointing the right way, bringing the sun in through the right windows at the right time of day? That's a little difficult to answer, if you're watching television, the sun can be a nuisance Yes of course when it comes in, pours in those, the house faces west er consequently although it's very pleasant in the afternoon and evenings when you're not watching television erm, it has its drawbacks on the other hand the garden is most unfortunately orientated alright? I think that's a minor problem but perhaps architects now pay a little more attention to and that is that, in the afternoon when you like to sit in the evening when you like to sit in the garden in the sunshine you are sitting in the shadow because the house er is between the sun and the garden I can't think of any more questions for the moment Alright So do you think I could ask you something about what you please tell No we're alright please tell me when you want me to go because Yeah if I over st don't let me over stay No, no, no, no. Er I liked to ask you erm about if you, if you think that Harlow lives up to the ideal of the New Town? It could be asked what is disappointing about Harlow, and I suppose that the first thing that strikes one is the design fault so far is the road work, the road network is concerned and er, and the inadequacy of the road, for roads for modern traffic. Very obviously when this town was designed and laid out and nobody foresaw the growth of the private motor car, er today private motor car is accepted, but in a town which was built perhaps the idea that one in twenty would own a motor car and we're now faced with the probably one in three have a motor car, we're now faced with a problem which can only detract from life in the town, also the fact that huge lorries are passing through what were envisaged as quiet residential neighbourhoods with a consequent breaking of curbs and of paving stones where the lorries are compelled to mount the pavings in order to get round parked cars and things of that nature it detracts from the life in Harlow I do, I think a considerable extent, erm, the other factor is that there's become a lack of pride in the town by the people who live in it, this is seen from the amount of rubbish, and refuse that is dropped from the minor vandalism that goes on the graffiti, er particularly in underpasses where people are walking to the town centre and that, those are the things where the town has lost its way, when we first came here you never saw bits of paper and packages from sweets and cigarettes and things, perhaps maybe because the package industry has developed over the years and that er whereas whenever we had responsibility for taking a small child out, if it had sweets it was encouraged to put the wrappings in its pocket until it got home, now of course it's encouraged to drop it just where it wants to and er this not only applies to children, some of the worst culprits are the adults who leave the, leave the public houses with a can of beer to drink on the way home and drop it just when they've finished the last drop of beer or the fish and chip paper's just dropped. I think this is detracting, I think it's inconsiderate, it certainly shows a lack of respect for one's neighbours or indeed for the town one lives in and yet very often I'm fully aware of the fact that the people who do the dropping are the first to complain that the Council doesn't keep the town clean. What, do you think that there's any connection between what you mentioned before about when you claimed for er bomb damage erm that working class people about being, supposed to have a piano, do you think there's a connection between that sort of idea and the idea of people that lived in Harlow in Council houses shouldn't have cars? No, I don't think that had a great deal to do with it, erm it was question that when the town was designed the, there hadn't been this sudden burst in living standards. If you compare when we first came to Harlow, which is only twenty years ago, the possession of a television set, erm was only just becoming the normal thing Mm the possession of the motor car was just becoming the norm, but the town had been designed fifteen years earlier And what do you think of the idea of ways that the, that the way the house types were graded, the fact that some of them were in fact meant to be executive or managerial classes and others were meant to be for people with less income, do you think that this is again recreating this sort of class system within the planning of the town? I think that what we've got is the acceptance by the designers and the planners of the class system that they knew Mm they had no vision of a classless society, erm, personally while I've no desire to see uniformity, I see no earthly reason why some people because they have a lower income should be compelled to live in inferior and perhaps crowded conditions, whereas the man with five or six or seven times their income can choose a larger house in a much more delightful district and I think it is things like that that make the difference between what I as a young socialist agitator was advocating and what we find today. I find too that circumstances compel a socialist Council like Harlow to be constrained and constricted when building, there are too many laws and regulations which are based on the fact that, for instance, today's government thinks that people who rent houses are second class citizens. Can you give an example when you say that the law is designed? Yes, erm, let us take one little factor, this question of the agitating the media and the, today, and that is the reduction in interest charges. Now when interest charges fall, the person who is buying the house benefits from the reduction in interest charges, but the person who is renting a house in local authority and then in this case nobody, nobody else in Harlow to rent it from, is faced with, not with a decreased monthly rental, but with an ever increasing one because as more and more Council houses are sold the cost of maintaining that there, the superstructure of the town, the cost of maintaining Council houses goes on increasing and so the burden is laid on the tenants and the tenant can find, will find himself that pound for pound increasing his rent while the house owner is decreasing his mortgage charges and at the end of the day the tenant is paying increased rent, increased rate and with nothing to show for it, erm, I've always been in favour of a sale, of, of property er owner occupiers, but not at the expense of the people who cannot afford to be owner occupiers, ah, to my mind, the present housing system is designed to maintain the existing class structure because even with the large discounts that one gets and nobody's ever yet convinced me that why you should get a discount because you buy a Council house, but if you buy one privately owned you can't get a discount and it, there's, this, this is so utter nonsense, but it is throwing a much heavier burden every time a house is sold on the remaining houses which are for rent, and so you that, although the idea is to make it a classless this society with more and more people owning their own properties the mo the mere fact that the majority of people in the town cannot afford to buy even the reduced priced Council house, is an example that the, the system, the class system a division by income still exists. Yeah may I ask Mrs some more questions? Would you mind answering some questions? Well she's a bit shy, but I'll help her. I wanted to ask you about the furniture. Can you hold it, if you just hold it about, like that, yes. Erm, do you mind answering some questions about your furniture? Oh, well, what do you want to know? Erm, you seem to like modern furniture Yes, yes Why did you choose modern furniture? Well Come in, come in, come in Jon. Morning. Good morning. Is it? Oh aye. I was laying a heavy carpet yesterday, and my Oh right. my chest's full of st It's er gunge. . Was it a s this time of the month already? Aye.. Good? I dunno er are you taking blood cos I've Doctor to see this afternoon. Er it's immaterial to me I mean I'm, I'm, I'm totally unprejudiced. I mean if maybe it'd be better if he does it Jon because he Oh I was Aye. I was thinki no I'm no being facetious. No no no no no no no It's just I'm just thinking. He'll, cos he'll see the results then, Aye. and there's less chance of them getting lost because if we send it over to Monkland and it comes back here, it goes to Doctor , you know how he's all over the place, and he's doing it all day, seeing clinic. as he's got Strathclyde, and he's got er Aye. Stonehouse as well. May be better if he does it this afternoon pal Well that's for, you know for, for the sake of getting the, the, the stuff all in the right place at the right Aye time. Aye aye. But urine test, absolutely fine, no problem there at all young Jon. That's smashing. Got a wee bit of reaction to the Sulfasalazine and the penicillin, mind. Oh right, aye. Er normally thirst. Right. I'm drinking water and and tea That's okay. That's alright. Anything. Coffee. Anything at all. But that's about the most I had. I started off at the s at the start I was er I was getting mouth ulcers, and then well I didn't get them to the severity that I got them with the sulfasalazine That's Er funny, cos sulfasala I've been s I've certainly been using it for years and years and years with different folk fo er for something completely different. Aha. I mean it didn't come for, come out for arthritis. Arthritis , no. It came out for something else. And I've used it oh, for about thirty odd years. I never found anybody with any trouble ever having any trouble with it. And yet when folk got it for their arthritis, okay? Yeah There's no trouble with er with the Sulfasalazine Aye. So there should be no problem. Yeah, that's right. Renal problems and er I was having bowel problems ulcers in my mouth. Mhm. That's right. And I was quite amazed. Eh? Oh aye. I was quite amazed. But er if you . said you know? Aye. But er I was away for a week there, I only came back on Saturday. Good, good Er did you get to? I was away up er Nunkton Kildray it's between Invergordon and Paine It's not my part of the world at all, It's beautiful don't know it , I don't know it , is it? Oh. Oh, right. Right aye. Oh So my w Jessie and I had a wee break. Peace and quiet? Aye,we we've been having a lot of trouble with the people next door, and er Mhm. it, it's really quite amazing. Oh . I can believe it. Erm trouble with neighbours is Well it's not unusual in . I hardly think that I'm able to run about banging doors at four o'clock in the morning. It's I'm up a I haven't seen you too often . I'm up against the six footer, and a five foot ten wife Aha. er and you know. having a that's what it's . That's right, that's right. Thanks . Okay. , Jon. Right. Bye. We need you in a semicircle and the best way to do that is to push your chairs roughly around that grey line There's a nice swivelly one Erm you pass those round in either direction, from now on it's, it's bandage time. Denise is going to do bandaging and I'm going to do bandaging and so are you, so you have these packs and these packs, if you'd like to take one pack each, I don't know if there's a pin in them, you might find a pin in there please look after them and bring them back each day, you'll find a bandage and a roll of bandage in there and so their your own properties In your text book you've got quite a lot of information in there about reinforcing, what we're going to do in the practical session and it's always a help I think when you have a lot of the, thrown at you to know that you can just put it up and there it is if you get a bit confusing or can't remember what's what, so on page one six nine it starts telling you all about nursing and bandages and general hygiene which we've already talked quite a lot about but it's very useful for you to know, you can go there and look, and if you just go through the pages from there on one seventy, one seven one, one seven two, one seven three and then on one seven four it's got the general rules for applying bandages apply bandages when the casualty is sitting or lying down, you always sit your casualty down and you work from the front of, I say why do you work from the front of the thing? So you can keep So you can see how they're looking, see if they're going pale a bit or if they're going to fall off their chair and talk and reassure them. That's right, erm always make sure that the injured parts are well supported bandages should be firm enough to do the job and large enough to cover the wound all of this is the sort of thing which you need to be referring back to if you're in any doubt. On page one seven five you've got how to check the circulation, after you've put the bandage on to make sure it's not too tight, it's not stopping all the blood supply, press a fingernail if there's only a finger nail and the, it should go white of course if you press it, then the blood should go back and it goes back pink again or an area of er skin, always check your circulation after you've put your bandage on. Now when you've actually opened your pack you'll find, what you got your triangular bandage here. Now I'm going to show you now how you going to put it away again, fold it, afterwards, opening it up alright, everyone open their bandage up? Now when it's opened it's useful as a sling, two sorts of slings we're going to do, high sling and the low sling but also if you fold it, it's very useful as a bandage too, if you put it across your knee, then you bring the point up towards you like that and then again, fold it the base up to the top again . and again face up to the top and there you've got a bandage, okay? One stage before that you've got a very broad bandage which is helpful for supporting things, we'll learn about how to use that later. When you've got it to the final fold there you've got your ordinary fold bandage and if you want, pack it away like that, you bring the end in the centre, there, so and again the ends in to the centre, just so that they meet like this, like this the centre, just so that they meet there, again, start like this, ends just to meet in the centre don't overlap them too much and again bend into the centre and you've got a nice little pad, if you ever need a pad for plonking on a wound quickly, there you've got a pad, or putting against an ear or anything you want it for and you open it up quickly and you've got a bandage, two of those and you've got a but it's a very handy way to keep. When you've got your bandage in your pack, I've explained to you before, you open it up in the first aid kit it's sterile, yeah, you open it up by the one hand goes one way, one hand goes the other, break it open, put the cardboard away and you need to be ready to try before you pull the next bit off don't you because as soon as you've opened that it's not sterilized any more, so you open that up and you find, unwrap it unwrap it as I showed you before with the first aid kit, comes out first and then you see how the padding because this wadding is stitched onto the back, and the front is the bit you put against the wound and you put it straight against the would without or touching it and that pad should be big enough to cover the wound, so you should something, overlaps, alright, and then if you find, if you unwrap the roll a little bit further, you don't want to unroll it completely, your see that if while you're using it in practice you need to roll it up again backwards towards the back of the bandage like so, we'll roll it up again, backwards and when you get to the bandage you just fold the bandage up around the long end and wind the short end round it firmly and there it's ready for use again in practice, you wouldn't of course do that for real would you? Put away, use another one. So that's how you look after your bandages and all these things that we're going to show you you'll find in those little sections in your first aid book so if you get confused or why you've only got to look up in the book. Let's do the sling first. I thought we'd do the sling first, high sling because it's very important to get it high and not pull it, everyone, anyone gets asked to do the high sling in their exam and if you can put a good high sling on you're halfway to passing Mm and from that it can't be bad can it? So I'll be the casualty and at the moment we won't worry about all the various things you use a high sling for, we just want to make sure that you can actually do it, okay? Can you just come back a little further and then they'll be able to see, better if all round the side Okay? Right, now then, be like this I'll pretend that I've done something that needs to be, a high sling to support me in this fashion. And I, I'm going to be working from behind Denise because you all need to see, but you would be working from the front as I've already talked about, so you need your triangular bandage, alright, and there's your long edge, and there's your point as we call it, a sort of elbow shaped, think of that as elbow shaped because it always goes towards the injured elbow. Now, that when you arrange your sling in the first place, it's crucial to the success and ease of which you finalize the bit round the elbow. You arrange it so that this long side is vertically up and down the body, right, in that direction. Don't let it come across like that, the temptation is to think that you've got to have all this bit up here, now you don't want this up here because it's very difficult to cope with once you've tied it round to get it round the elbow, you want the least amount that you can get, just cover the arm and then it makes it much easier to deal with at the end. The amount at the top that you need is just enough to tie a reef knot oh I've forgot to show you a reef knot didn't I? Tie a reef knot. We all use a reef knot in erm first aid and again it is in the book a very good illustration in the book reef knot and then nobody knows how to do it, I will show you in a bit, but that's enough to do a knot, the knot comes on just above the fingers, in the hollow of the neck, okay? So that's how you arrange it like that, the first thing you then do is to tuck the spare bit under the hand, cos the hand then there anchors it for you Okay? and the hand doesn't sneak out afterwards and starts popping out and then it's useless, then the rest of all this stuff you just get it out of the way under the arm, it's all gone, right, this bit comes up between the two shoulder blades, don't make the mistake of bringing it across there, a lot of people do that, that won't do, you have to come round the back and between these two shoulder blades to get maximum support, you've got to hold this elbow up and then you tie it near the hand, now I recommend that you tie it and talk to your casualty, half tie it and say is that supporting you enough? It feels okay thanks, yeah Cos then you can draw it up a little tighter if it's too loose, if it's like that and, most people do it too loose, is that tight enough? No it isn't. Right I'll just draw it up a little bit tighter, is that tighter for you? Better, better And now I'll do the other half of my reef knot, right, and tuck the ends in immediately, they don't like seeing ends because they're considered dangerous in first aid so don't forget to do it, do the knot, tuck it in all in one movement and then it's done, okay, how does that feel? That's fine Of course you're reassuring all the time as you do this Mm, mm Got a bit that's fall down Hello we haven't finished yet, haven't finished. Now you're gonna want a pin, these are rather small pins, I recommend that peop people who have got large hands try and fit their first aid kit out with large pins, they're much easier to handle, but firstly they do not put pins in their mouths for obvious reasons, either, either have it on the table open ready or just pop it in the front of shirt while you do this bit, okay? So you're going to fold this around the elbow to give support to the arm and in this one you're gonna fold first of all forward and then back, can you see that little neat envelope? A neat little envelope that's supporting quite firm, that's supporting the elbow, now pin it, again, now you can see how important it is not to have lots and lots of bandage up here, cos what will you do with it then? It's too much, if you ever have too much you can just fold a bit down, if you have a big bandage you can fold either of those edges down first if you've got too much and then you fold it forward and back, now your pin sticks in, but all the material and out of all the material and it goes in a straight upward direction, again it must go in that direction so that if per chance it comes undone it falls out and drops on the floor, whereas if it was sideways or downwards it would open and stick in your casualty, so that's why we have it done that way. Would you like to see that again or do you think you could manage it now? See it again See it again, right, I'll just do it this time without talking it through, and you can just watch Yeah and I tell you what we shall do we shall change arms We'll change arms as well you'll need to practise on both arms. And there's no use getting in the exam on Thursday and say ah well I'm afraid I've not done it on that arm so erm lost Okay, so there you are you see, you're, you're a first aider and you come up to the person and you hold it the way you did last time and you think ah, now that's the wrong way round of course, there's my elbow point, there's my injured elbow, so I have to be that way round, mm, so you turn it round the other way, right, your elbow shape goes to the injured elbow and your long line goes straight up and down the line of the body, you arrange it so that you only just covering the forearm there, with just enough above the hand to tie your reef knot that would be too little and that would be too much just enough above the hands to tie your reef knot, the first thing you do is to tuck nice, big bit of material right under the hand and anchor it into position, just keep that resting there and all the rest of this goes under the arm up between the shoulder blades there and you tie your first half of the reef knot just above the fingers in the hollow of the neck here, now that's important because round the back here if you press on that bit of muscle there, there's a big band of muscle, if you've got a knot on that it gives a great deal of discomfort very quickly so you want to get the knots round in the hollow here that doesn't hurt your casualty, there, draw it up half the knot, is that tight enough? It feels fine Yeah that feels fine and then do your other half of knot, reef knot and tuck it in straight away, you get your pin ready, have it on, either on the table or ready like that, now if you've got too much material ever you just fold that down, there, if that's too much, which isn't too much with Denise because it's the right size sling, sometimes you have to improvise and then you fold if forward and back, firmly, take the pin and put it, put your two fingers down between the casualty so that your fingers are apart and there's a space between your fingers so you can stick the pin in and out again without any danger, if you put the fingers apart like that, if you do stick the pin in yourself and draw blood would you please throw the pin away, as a matter of automatic hygiene, it mustn't be used again once it's been stuck into somebody Or in your casualty or in your casualty, it must be thrown away Do it up, discard it Alright get another one from the box would you please make sure that all through these practices that you deal with different people all the time cos in the exam and for real afterwards you'll have to bandage all different shape people and if you just get, work in pairs you don't get that sort of practice, by all means start of with somebody next door to you but each time you do one go across the room and find somebody you haven't done before. And if the gentleman having to put bandages on a lady and you want to put your hand underneath there just excuse me a moment, alright, because in the exam one row of you will certainly going to have a lady bandage okay, put slings on and to bandage so it's just as well not to get to you know used to bandaging up great big chaps and then you'll find you've got some little tiny five foot two or five foot nothing lady bandaging in exam, alright, so swap around, so get yourselves so you've got a partner and use your bandages and let's just see you do the high sling to start. All got safety pins by the way? Yeah they had them in the little packs, okay? Right How many people know how to do a reef knot for sure? No Right, so I'm not wasting my time a reef knot then? If, if you look in your books page one seven seven, you'll see a beautifully illustrated instruction on how to do it, which you can refer to yourself this evening or later on in the course if you forget but I'm now gonna show you how to do one as well, you, if you want to know it's there for you to look up you take the bandage and fold it into your narrow fold band and put it round your leg, you've got something to tie a reef knot round, okay?if you know how to do a reef knot already fine, just do it, if you don't, follow instructions. Narrow fold bandage you've done it correctly then. The doing it the same way each time and a reef knot is the opposite way each time, alright, undo it, once again, just once again to make sure you know are you ready? Once again, now it doesn't matter which way round you start, you can start left over right or right over left, but the second time you do it opposite to the first time, so the first time I put the left one over first and the right one over that and then tuck it through, just like tying a shoe lace really, okay? And the next, pick the ends up, I put the right one down first and the left one across it and then put that one through and then that's a reef knot no that's a granny over there anyone not sure? That, that's the one you have to remember which one you put on which, that was the left on top of the right, now the right on top of the left yes, come on which one did you do first? That's the right on top of the left okay, right on top of the left, now you've crossed over again left on top of the right, put that through there okay yeah All okay I think mm, yes all okay now, right. I bang my head, I cut my scalp, yeah, everybody, I bang my head, I cut my scalp, not massive bleeding none of the bandages we're doing this morning are to do with massive bleeding, they're all to do with what we call minor wounds, right so small cut, but it needs attention, okay, so I cut my scalp Cor okay so I've got my pad it's a bit tender alright, so I'm going to ask my casualty to hold my nice clean sterile pad that I've got folded ready over the wound, there, gently, okay? Yep Then I'm going to take another triangular bandage and I'm going to open it up and make just a little fold, this is going to go on her forehead and that little fold just helps with keeping it firm and stopping the bandage slip, now, just put it around the forehead like that, okay? Cross it over, round the back, and back up to the front again, do a reef knot here and tuck your ends in straight away of course like so and then this little bit can just be tucked up where you've crossed the two ends and make it look neater with no ends hanging out, no that, all that does is keep the dressing secure, keep infection out, okay? The difficult part about this one is that people all have odd shaped heads, now and you find that if you put them on too high they squidge off like that, and you've got to think of bandaging an egg basically, if you had an egg with a little hole in one end and you've got to put a bandage round you'd have to put it very carefully round the widest bit wouldn't you for it to stay firm and that's the secret, everyone's heads different and as you put it round you've got to see where you can get it, where, sometimes it's over the ears, sometimes it's above the ears according to the peoples' shaped, different shaped heads everyone's different, anything else? Okay, have a go at it and we'll come round and correct what you're doing as you're doing it, alright, so you want to pad over the wound to keep infection out and then try to get your bandage on top of that to keep the dressing in place. Right, well we want to make sure that you can get out to lunch sort of by, that's running a bit fast that clock, we'd like to get you out to lunch by about half past twelve otherwise you'll end up being late don't you with all the other people right Right, okay, what now, erm roller bandages so you can put those triangular ones away for a minute can't you Let's do the elbow and we'll do the elbow and knee okay elbow and knee then using the roller bandage And again here it is two pages further on in your book, if you forget how to do it, just look up, okay? Roller bandages Well I fell over, slipped over in the car park out there, all gravelly and gritty out there and I scraped my elbow and I've got a nasty graze all on the elbow and it's all full of grit and muck, help Come and sit down here my dear help let's give us a little now if we've got a tap handy probably the best thing would be to run it under the cold tap and that hopefully would take away any dirt and extra bits and pieces that are stuck around it. If there's anything embedded in it like gravel or something and it doesn't come away easily you mustn't, it comes under the categories of what you call foreign bodies, which first aider is not at liberty to poke about, you must leave foreign bodies that don't come away easily where they are and bandage them round and send them off to hospital or a doctor, but assuming it's just a little clean graze, if I haven't got a tap to put it under, then I must use little bits of gauze to wash, put in a bowl of water and just wipe, yeah, and you always wipe obviously from the centre of a wound towards the outside, otherwise if you start to wipe across the whole thing you take dirt from one side of the wound across and drop it off in the middle somewhere, so you wipe from the centre out and throw that piece away and you take another piece and wipe from the centre out and so on until you feel happy, quite happy. I mean, well if you haven't got gauze in your first aid box, but you could have something like a Mediwipe or you might be able to use, open up your bandage and you can use, you know, several pieces of this, just keep going down the bandage and then you know clean it and get rid of that bit, okay, another clean bit okay, so you can adapt with whatever you've got in your first aid box, yes, and you won't necessarily have scissors to hand so you'll have to do whatever you've got and the little Mediwipes are very useful for that, but don't use one Mediwipe for seventy five grazes, okay, one Mediwipe for one wipe and then discard, okay? Okay, so I'm going to open up my sterile dressing now So I actually put my arm out straight for you now? Do you think it'd be better if you had it bent cos it'll be easier for you after I've bandaged it It's better bent is it? Yes Okay, alright it would be better if you can manage alright to bend if it's not too uncomfortable so I can bend it, I can bend it like that then? Right, you can only bend, you can only put the arm in the position that your casualty will let you of course, but it is more comfortable to have it bandaged in that position, than having it like that. So you open it up and you find which is your sterile bit and you put that over the point of the elbow and you can bring that once around and you can ask her to hold it for you, if you like It goes in there right yes and then you take your long end and you wind above covering the edge and overlapping and then the low, then covering the edge and overlapping, there and again you keep working your way up and down, a figure of eight until you get to the end of your bandage then tie away from the body in your reef knot, either you tuck your ends in or if that's awkward you can just put a sticking plaster over the ends to get them out of the way like that, so just tuck the ends in and I don't think your casualty's going to need a sling for a little graze like that Right, and so that she can still move and as the same thing applies to the knee exactly the same thing, wound there you keep the knee bent a little bit and you can do exactly the same bandage like a figure of eight, okay? So one person will do the bandage on the elbow and the other person with the good looking knees, you'll be the casualty for where you've got to put the knee bandage on, cos you won't, if you don't roll your trousers up a bit you're not going to have much bandage to do much bandaging with on the knee, okay, so decide amongst yourselves who's got the good looking knee Everybody okay now? Yeah Yeah? Excuse me I've got a circulation problem Now All okay then? Yeah? A couple more to show you then you can practise these when you have a bit more practice time so we can get you out to lunch on time. If you have to bandage a hand for example, okay? Somebody's slipped over and they've got all the grit in their knuckles in the part of their knuckles and you want to bandage the hand or there's a cut on the hand, even on the palm, we can do that one later when it's really, when it's really a gash, gushing blood we can do this afternoon, I repeat again none of these which you've done this morning will control severe bleeding, get it into your heads this is just to cover to keep infection out, alright, these are not to control severe bleeding just covering a minor wound or a graze, right? So she's got her knuckles grazed, you've cleansed it, put it into a drop of water,ra or else we've used the Mediwipes or the end of the bandage okay, now we just cover it, okay, so it goes over, can you just straighten out your hand for me, it goes over the wound, okay and you can take this one that she can hold it for you just up there, right, now the rest of this just winds round, the only thing you really need to do is to just make sure that you leave the thumb out, cover up the bottom right and then come up towards the wrist, cover up the top of the pad, come back down again, leave the thumb out all the time, got the idea? Right, cover up again, come up towards the wrist, if you've got any more bandage, go round perhaps one more time okay and just make sure at the end of the day that you don't tie too tightly round the wrist, why not? Stop circulation Absolutely, so really we want to tie away from this pulse point here towards the back of the hand, good enough Yeah right, tie it off in a reef knot, if you've got bits that are left dangling they're too long and you can't go round again because it's gonna make it too tight, you can either tuck them in or else you can fold them down, a nice clean plaster and put it right over the top, okay? Now that would do, that would do whether the, whether the knuckles were hurt or it was just a minor cut in the palm of the hand there, that would do and you can use the same type of bandage on the foot alright, so that's if the hand was damaged, now supposing we didn't have the hand damaged, but we had instead a cut up here, okay, again clean it and if you clean it with lots of water always remember to dry off around the wound because bugs love a moist skin to grow in, dry the wound before you apply the dressing okay if you can, dry it off the best you can and then you're going to place that over the cut, remember you want the pad to be long enough, big enough, okay, now she can hold this for you again, she can hold it above where the wound is and now when you bandage this one you always bandage from the narrow part to the fat part of the limb, you always bandage from the narrow to the fat, so you take the bandage down Why? Because that way it stays on if you do it the other way it'll drop off it's as simple as that, okay, cover the pad and as you spiral up the arm all you need to do is to cover about two thirds of what you've just done before, just like a spiral, you find the bandages, the more you use those roller bandages of yours the worse they get to control because they lose their, you know, nice and stretchiness, so you just do, cover up the pad at the top, tie always on the top of the arm never underneath here. Check with your casualty that it's comfortable, yes? and does it feel quite firm for you? Not too tight though? No And those bits again, either tuck them in out of the way or better still fold them over and put a big plaster over the top to get them right out the way so no ends are left dangling, remember for most people you're doing this for they'll probably be returning to their place of work, okay, so they need to be safe to return to work, everybody okay on that lot? So let's just recap on the ones you've done this morning, you've done a high sling yes Mm you've used a triangular bandage to cover a wound in the scalp, it's not a chopping block wound right, it's not the chopper in its wound right, it's just a minor wound in the scalp, yes, and that came round and tied at the front, tucked at the back, you used these roller bandages to cover a graze or a wound on the end of an elbow or a knee or the hand, foot and then a straight one up the arm okay, so a lot of your bandaging is using these little roller bandages with the lint pad and don't forget when you get into the exam do it, don't do it the wrong way round, remember that you look at your bandage and you put the lint onto the wound, not the other way round right, yeah, you put the lint face down onto the wound, okay? Any questions of anything we've done? All alright on that, yes? We get time to practise these again before the exam? Oh yes , now if by any chanc chance you do have a question in the exam where you're asked you know instead of the wound being on top of the scalp, some clever so and so decides that you're good at improvising and you've got a wound over the top of the eyebrow, the eyebrow's split, okay, so there wouldn't be much good of me going a minute, pull that there, trying like this round there right, okay, it's not really in the best interest of the casualty is it, right, now what dressing would you apply to that do you think? A plaster Plaster An eye plaster, an eye pad A an eye pad won't really sop up blood will it? A roller plaster One of them, of course you will, you use a roller bandage won't you again? In this instance you can put it across the eyebrow, right, across the eyebrow, ask them to hold it and if you're doing a bandage like this the way to keep it on is to have one part of the bandage going above the ear and the next time you go round go below the ear right, go above the ear and the next time you go round go below the ear okay and then finally just tie it off, get the idea? Okay, so they may ask you to use something which you haven't necessarily had to do before so that they're really all that the examiner's testing is that you've got a little bit of nous, a little bit of savvy and with what you've got available you can improvise a dressing or use the dressing in a sensible manner so that your casualty's comfortable and you're doing the best you can for them, okay? Lovely. Anything else to add Audrey? No that's fine Everyone alright then, okay, it's time for grub isn't it? Yes it is, quarter past one please Quarter past one back here, okay? Anyone want coffee? Anyone staying here and want a cup of coffee? Yes please Yeah we'll do one in a minute for you then So you have the heart of the centre of it, two pumps back to back yes, the major pump or the stronger pump on the left hand side, why? That's where the blood leads by, okay, on that side of the heart the left hand side of the heart it's being pumped and therefore the muscle is a bigger muscle, that's doing the contracting, the blood push out and it relaxes back again and that allows the blood to be sucked back down into the heart, okay, and the next time it's shh, that goes out and then it relaxes down again and the blood sucks back down into the heart, okay so that's what it does, all the muscle can do is that, muscle can only retract and then it relaxes, contract and then it relaxes, that's what the heart's doing all the time, how many beats a minute? Sixty to eighty Sixty to eighty you can feel it at pulse point, can't you, here, here, we'll show you so more in a minute, okay? So you know how to check whether the circulatory system is working because if it's working you'll be able to find a pulse pounding away, yes, that's how you check it, you know the respiratory system's working because if you want to check it what do you want to look for? Rise and fall Rise and fall of chest breath on your hand or your cheek, circulatory system working, pulse, okay? And that's what you're checking, the other side of the heart, the right hand side of the heart with a smaller pump, where's that pumping? Blood out The lungs Back up to the lungs, okay, now in that little system there, there's just one thing that's interesting to note, when you spoke about circulatory system this morning or yesterday rather with Audrey, you spoke about the blood being always leaving the heart, yes, via the arteries, yes Yes and always coming back to the heart By the veins by the veins , there's always an exception to every rule and the exception to that rule in the case of the heart and the lung connection is the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein, you may not get asked anything about this, but just in case you do it's as well to know, in that instance the flow is reversed, in other words the pulmonary vein takes blood away from the heart and up to the lungs, and the pulmonary artery brings the oxygenated blood back down to the heart from the lungs, if you want to have a look at the diagrams for that and look at it yourself later on, there's no need for you to get concerned or confused about this at all, there's no need. You'll find the little diagram showing you where the pulmonary vein and the pulmonary artery are on page eleven, page eleven if you want to refer to it right, if you want to look at it in a closer detail tonight that's fine and if you want to see what I'm saying now in a diagrammatic form look on page thirteen now if you look at that you'll see some, the blue vein blood vessels it's coming out of the right hand side of the heart and if you look at the direction of the arrows, okay, they're going away from the heart, do you agree with me? They come out of the heart and branch like a wishbone, one to each lung, do you see that, now the arrow direction is away from the heart and that's a vein and you'd expect that to be coming back to the heart wouldn't you? And that's the only time you're going to find it when you're linking the heart and the lungs, now look at those two areas where you've got blood coming back down into the heart, can you see those two wishbones there coming back down into the heart, do you see where I mean, yes? Now those are arteries, that's the pulmonary artery but it's coming back to the heart okay, that's the only time you're going to find the rule reversed, arteries leave the heart, veins come back to the heart, and the only time that rule is reversed is when you're linking the heart and the lungs through the pulmonary vein and the pulmonary artery, however, they are still carrying, the arteries are still carrying oxygen charged blood, yes, because it's come fresh from the lungs so it's still carrying nice red lovely oxygenated blood, yes, even though it's coming back into the heart, that is because it's come fresh from the lungs and the vein although it's going in the opposite direction the way you normally expect it, is still carrying the old rotten, you know, used up blood, because it's going back to the lungs to be recharged, do you understand it alright? That's the only time it'll be reversed Can you just say that bit about the pulmonary in the vein and the pulmonary in the wee artery again please The pulmonary artery comes back into the heart, the pulmonary vein goes away from the heart Vein goes home back up to the lungs, they are linking the heart and the lungs Yeah, I've written that down alright and if you look at the diagram on page thirteen and you look at the little arrow diagram you'll see that it gives it quite nice and clearly there is that alright? Just wanted to clarify that little point, so you know the organs that make up the circulatory system, you know how to check it, you know the one slight difference than what you normally expect veins and arteries to be doing okay? Now we need to talk a little bit about what happens when the veins or the arteries or the capillaries for that matter, the veins, the arteries or the capillaries have a leak in them, they become broken, now you already know that the circulatory system is a closed system and that the blood can only do its job if it's being transported within that system, once the blood comes outside of that system then it's lost the circulation and it cannot perform its proper function any more, in other words the body's losing its blood, okay, what condition do we call it when the circulatory system stops working properly? Shock Shock, do you understand the difference between the loss of pressure and loss of volume, volume would be when liquid was leaking out, coming out of the blood vessels, okay, pressure would be when the heart itself, the pump itself had failed or was not working properly, failed completely or was not working properly, do you understand the difference? Obviously eventually if people keep on leaking blood their pressure will fall but you could have a situation where there's not a single drop of blood yet lost to the system and yet the person's in shock because the blood's not being circulated properly off the heart, not a drop of blood lost to the system, but insufficient pressure, so shock can be caused by either of those two things, failure of the circulatory system because the pressure of the volume drops dangerously low, okay, you did a lot of work on what the person looks like, yes you as the casu you as the first aider will see this person in front of you, what will they be like? What will their face look like? .And perhaps the the neighbours leave the dog with Mandy how ever it is. The dog stays in the house on his own. Every day they go to work! Mm? Christine goes to work! The dog stays on his own! Well, Christine takes him up there if they come here for the weekend. Oh yeah. Or he, he goes and opens the door to let him out. Well there you, you see! Perhaps, perhaps they've arranged to go somewhere on Saturday. They might tomorrow night, I don't know! It's a great events coming here isn't it? When they're all and ! Well she doesn't go with Violet, does it? If they're , I bet she's got her nose in everything! No, I don't think she would. But if she wants . If they ask her to do something! She, she will. And if she wants a new pair of shoes she's gotta go to a new town and pay for them. everywhere to buy them! Got her a paper of shoes today for . Yeah but I haven't er decided right, I don't know her yet! Mm? I haven't decided, but I don't know her yet! .Can't wait till Margaret's gone! Mm. I'll go down then. Hoping that's gonna , ready like. Apart from everything, we know something about Margaret coming, see! And they're al , alright. Yeah. Shouldn't that be? Mhm. They will know nothing! Nothing wrong with her! No. No. Yeah er Prime Minister, John Major John Major's anxious wife, Norma has a job keeping her cool as she faces the anger of a town blighted by unemployment. The couple were both shoved and jostled as around one hundred demonstrators greeted them with jeers and shouts in Bolton, Lancashire. Police helmets went flying as officers formed a protective cordon around the Majors. Bricklayer, Tony one of the town's twelve thousand jobless said I came along to show my contempt with his government policies! Mr Major abandoned the plan of twenty minutes full campaign walk about after just five minutes ! Mm. We don't want them, you see! No. It looks better all the time don't it? Well i , if, it would be like that all over the country! But in one place ! Well it is like that all over the country though innit? No. Well I think the sky is brightening up! I do hope so! I mean, you can see that red bush in the corner quite clear now! Can you? Mm. And I would see it a lot clearer if my glasses were clean! Well I saw something here! I don't know what it was, but only a little tiny wee bit and it was real funny! I think . I can't find it now! It's always the way! No! Well I got some of . I can't remember where it is. Mm mm mm mmmm mm mm mm Oh ho, off to work we go da da da dum dum da da . What about ? James and Stuart a couple of and when he was preg erm that's Douglas Hurd. Oh yeah Dougie! He, when he was Foreign Secretary. What is he now? Foreign Secretary, you know? Mhm. He's so public, him. Oh God! Who sixty or nought again. Oh I see yeah. Okay. So we've got got a a rule somewhere. my ruler . I keep losing my set squares and rules and things. There's one though. Okay where was the centre of that? Right. Now this is a hexagon. Erm join that up, okay. and we should finish up with about six sides roughly. Now while I finish it off, if you'd like to just measure one of the interior angles that I've already done. And what's it come to? A hundred and twenty degrees. A hundred and twenty. Okay. Now according to your theory that you were applying to that Yeah. one, you just divide You say it's a six-sided figure, divide three sixty by six Oh right yeah. Oops. What angle does that give, that that sixty degrees? Where could you find that angle? Erm Could be oppo other side there if that was extended. Okay. I think so, if this was this this was extended . Oh, right. So if you extended that That bit there. That would be That is sixty. Now we've got a very special case here haven't we? Yeah. Because we've got sixties all over the place so maybe it wasn't a brilliant one to try but it gives us some indication of what's going on. Where's another? Another sixty? Erm between these, connected. Okay. Any other ones? No. Right. Now that one is bound to be sixty, the the angle at the centre, because that was how we made it. Yeah. Put that down and we thought right draw the circle,space it out equally,six equal angles is what we were doing at the same time as six equal arcs, all at sixty degrees, or all at one sixth of three sixty. Right yeah. Okay. Now the octagon. Could you do that one? Okay. So we'll make a little centre somewhere. Right. Okay. Right. Okay. Erm So what's the angle going to be? How are you working it out? Erm be three sixty divided by eight. Okay. What does that come to? Erm about About . Erm yeah . Use your calculator . So that's three sixty er Could you do three sixty divided by four? It's nine yeah so four and a half. Okay, so forty five. Okay. You start from wherever you like. start that way up. Bit easier. Good. So you'll get all your right angles marked, each ninety, and then the halfway points between Yeah. each ninety. This is I mean you wouldn't do this in an exam, you wouldn't draw one and work how you draw it, but by doing it now erm you get to know a regular figure. You get to know sort of how to construct one. I mean now if i said, Make me a a figure that's got ten equal sides, you could do it couldn't you? Yeah. Or twenty. So you could construct those. And then join the join these points up to the centre. Get that out of your way. So you'll be able to see. Well you know what the angle's going to be at the centre already don't you without Yeah. without measuring, cos it because of the way you constructed it. It's got to be forty five. So we can then when we've drawn that,find out what the other angles are,and try and work out what will always be true and what will depend on which angle you choose. If we draw a join a few of those up through the centre, just so we can mark the angle. So you can join any two opposite corners and it'll go through the centre . Yeah. Erm In fact you might as well do the last one as well. So what angle do you know absolutely definitely without thinking about it ? . And that is what? Forty five. That's forty five. That's your three sixty divided by eight. Okay. . And you've got lots of lots of triangles that are the same. That's forty five right? That's forty five. It looks forty five. Definitely. Yeah. Erm how can you tell it's forty five? Well I mean is there any way you could It's erm prove it? I mean you could measure it maybe and say Yeah. Okay it comes to forty five. You could draw lots of these figures. You did another one sixty, and it came to sixty. Yeah. Well it'd be for the this angle if you extended it so it'd be eight divided by the three sixty isn't it? Erm Three sixty divided by eight. It looks it looks as if it is. I'm not Yeah. disputing if it whether it is or it isn't, but how can we show that it is? How can we say , Erm Well it always will be? Oh right erm Think about what sort of things add up to one eighty. Yeah it'll be all all the angles on this line. Okay. Erm Let's say if we marked This is forty five degrees. Yeah. Okay. What about these two angles, what do we know about them? Oh right they've got to add up to a hundred and eighty Right. right. They're both the same angle for a start, because we've got an isosceles triangle, and forty five plus two X must add up to a hundred and eighty. Yeah. That one there is also X. So here we've got this angle plus two X . Yeah so the two X minus one eighty is Okay. the outer one. It'll always be that one. So this'll work for anything. Now,what was the question? What did they ask? A size of the interior angle of the regular octagon. What do they mean by the interior angle? The angle between these two points. Right. And what should it be? Erm A hundred and a hundred and thirty five. Okay. Right I see . So you've got the right idea of dividing it by eight, but you needed to take it on a stage and see what the was. Erm like I divided Yeah. divi divided divided by eight then minus one eighty. Mm. That'd get that angle all the time. Right. Yeah. It'll always work. Now the other question they've got is,What is the angle between the two rectangles? Well there's one rectangle and there's the other one at right angles to this one. What's that angle going to be? It looks like forty five. Erm It looks like forty five, and it's almost certainly going to be forty five, and we could probably work out some reason why it would be forty five. Would it be erm a hundred and thirty five for the interior angle? That's a right angle there, and Yeah. that's a right angle. Carry on.. Erm minus one eighty to get this angle. To get this one, yeah. And then the same Yeah. the other way round to get that one . So if it was that one, if you could get take that one, it could be anywhere along the plane. If you were at a right angle If it If it was two right ang er angle lines like that at right angles Right. So you do ninety degrees one one of your ninety degrees Yeah. off the off the one eighty . Yeah. Okay. So are you happy with that, that you can if someone gives you someone says Draw er a figure, er a regular polygon with twelve sides, you kn you know how to construct one? Yeah. And by constructing it you learn its properties if you like. This is that's that's the obvious one. That's the Yeah. big thing. That's always divide three sixty by N to give you the angle at the centre of the circle. What about these two angles, what's the important point about those then? Well add up to erm plus that would add up to n a hundred and eighty. Plus that they add up to a hundred and eighty. And . And they're the same. And they're . isosceles yeah. Right. So once you know that, these two are the same you take that from one eighty,halve the answer and it'll give you these angles, and if you've got that ang if you've got these angles,then you can work out most things. . Any q any questions they give you based on that, you'll be able to do it. Erm that way you'll have an understanding of it rather than just saying, Well this bit is always. Would it work for a square? Erm Without drawing it, try and talk about a square. What would happen? Erm How would you work out? If you d Er just sort of talk it through. Drawing a circle, what would you do? Well you'd er mark off Mhm. every erm ninety degrees. Okay. And draw through the points. You'd draw through the four points. work if you d drew a diagonal Okay. the centre. You know. Erm Be ninety. Ninety, ninety, ninety. And these angles would be? What would the angle Erm here be? Forty five. They'd be forty five . Isosceles yeah. So the interior angle. Would be ninety. Would be ninety. Yeah. And the exterior angle would also be Would be forty five. would also be ninety. Oh yeah it would. Yeah. Right? In a square . I see it. So it would work with a square. Erm would it work with a triangle? Erm three points the centre point. Right. So what would the angle at the centre be? It'd be erm twelve. Hundred and twenty degrees yeah . Hundred and twenty. Okay. Yes but it wou cos if you had the centre point up to the top of these two that'd be hundred and twenty, hundred and twenty, hundred and twenty. so if someone said like Do a a hundred-and-eighty-sided figure Yeah. it it'd just look like a circle. But you could do it. So you're happy with polygons? Okay. So that's one if it comes up again Definitely . No problem on that . Yeah. So you've obviously dropped a few marks on that. Yeah. Erm probably on this and on this one. The big thing there is there's no rule in life that says you know if someone says Five them you must draw five centimetres. Yeah. This might have been five knots, five miles an hour, Yeah. decide well we'll have five inches. Erm it is likely that it's not a linear scale anyway. It's possibly the Beaufort Scale Yeah. which is a sort of logarithmic scale . Yeah. Erm so don't make don't make too many assumptions. carry on with symmetry? Yeah. I got all of er for them more. Okay. So let's let's have a look at the others. Now you tell me which ones you think were an absolute doddle. A giveaway. This was the ones here. Mhm. Measure the size of the angle compass. Okay. Did you Erm protractor sorry. did you use that or No cos I didn't have it at the time when I did that. Would it have been an advantage to use the ? Erm well er yes I thought cos I'm just measuring the Yeah. It depends what you're used to. When you get used Aha. to this one, you'll find it so much easier. Yeah. Erm it's a bit off-putting at the start because it's got the two scales on. Yeah. Make sure you're reading the right one all the time. Okay. So no problem there. You think you got Did you did you see which ones you got full marks on? Erm yeah. I didn't do this I d I didn't quite finish this one cos we only had erm one and a half hour to do the two-hour paper like. Okay. And there were how many marks on that then? Erm erm eleven marks like. Mm. Mm. So at the start of the paper,have a quick whiz through, see where the marks are, Do them first, yeah. and think, Well I'm going to Not necessarily do them first. I mean you can whi you could go through and you can pick up lots of ones and twos that build up. You're probably going to do them anyway, and they're good to get you into it. So you're thinking, Oh this hasn't been an exam, these are dead easy, to just play yourself in. Erm but don't like the Mm. ones the or others, if you're getting stuck on them, don't miss something like this that you could do and get full marks. Yeah. Er you know makes a big difference to your final grade doesn't it? Right. Any problems with these? Erm no. They they they were they were straightforward, just Okay. How did you do this one? Erm I drew a I drew a erm Venn diagram. Right. Put my twenty one in the Whimby circle or Whitby circle, and the thirteen in the erm Scarborough circle. Put X in the middle, and twenty one minus X . Okay. Just just show me how you did that one. So a trip to Whitby and a trip to Scarborough. You've got thirty pupils interested in one or both trips. Right. Twenty one interested . in the Whitby and thirteen interested in the one to Scarborough. So there's an X in the middle. How many interested in both of these trips? Erm Now okay. You've got thirty down there, that's good,X in the middle, twenty one minus X, thirteen minus X . Yeah. Okay. So So when you get to that point you you've more or Yeah. less solved the problem haven't you. If you can if you can handle simple equations, you get the answer. Like most of these, the key Mm. is what should we call X. Once you've Yeah. sorted that out then you follow your system. Okay. And does that does that work out? How many would you have in here then? Yes you'd have erm seventeen. So you've got seventeen in there, seventeen in Whitby. And eleven. Okay. And then erm four interested in the both trips so What does that come to? Erm erm it's twelve. Oh right that's not right is it, no. Erm Mm. Okay so we've got eleven and four is fifteen, and seventeen is thirty two. It says there were thirty pupils. Yeah. Mm. Now did you see your marks on this one? Erm no. I d I didn't er not on that one. No that's okay. So there's another one where probably you can pull up your marks quite easily . Yeah. Cos you know you know the method, you know what to do, it's just a question of sorting it out. You know a little bit of extra thinking about it. So one of the points that sort of comes up is you haven't used the thirty at all have you? Now did they give you that and it's something you don't need or do you think maybe it's something you do need? Er . I just didn't know how to apply it . Mm. Okay. Is this basic idea okay? We've got X pupils interested in both, so we've got twenty one minus X in that and thirteen want to go to Scarborough, okay? Thirteen minus X in there. Now where did this come from? Twenty one minus thirteen equals two X. Well you've got your X there, you've got your two Xs there, so you subtract them and you've got Mm. and then take the halve. Well th you've got an equation, okay. Twenty one minus thirteen equals two X. Now where did it where did it come from? Show me where each term from so you could Thanks very much. Cheers Dad. Put away your er luggage. . Er cheers. Scattered about . Cheers. Right. Okay. Thanks very much. . S erm so I had to subtract these two. Mm. Try and explain it in terms of say let's get all these kids out into the school yard, Yeah. and draw two big circles that intersect, Yeah. and say, Now we want to sort you out, see who's going where, so we can organize the coach now, and if you're interested in Scarborough go and stand in that circle,Whit Whitby there, interested in both then stand where the two circles intersect. Yeah. Okay. Now take it from there. What will you what how can you work out Well erm just count how many's erm I mean two teachers come back and one of them says, Well I've counted all those who are going to Whitby. and the other one says, I've counted all those who are going to Scarborough, Mhm. and er nobody remembered to count the ones in the middle. But we do know there were thirty pupils, which hasn't Has that appeared in your equation anywhere? No not really. No. Now erm I still don't really understand where you got this from. Erm Why did you you do twenty one minus thirteen for a start? Well I had the the twenty one and thirteen in the two groups so subtract those two and have twice the amount of X I thought I would have . Erm you you seem to be equating the groups. Okay. We won't go into where you go that from cos I think it sounds a bit like sort of clutching at straws really. Yeah. I'm going to get an equation out of this. You you've you've started off brilliantly. You've got marked on you know exactly how many are going to Whitby,right, twenty one minus X, how many are going to both, and how many are going to Scarborough. So what could you find out from that? That ties up with this. That ties up with . You could er subtract the number going to Whitby from thirty. You could. Erm You could do something a lot And then simpler. A lot simpler. How many pupils were there altogether? There were thirty pupils so And how many are there standing there in the playground? There's thirty. Right? Right. So an equation? Yeah. Count how many you've got in here. We've got twenty one minus So twenty one minus X plus thirteen minus X is equal to thirty. And those in the middle as well. But oh twenty one minus X plus X plus thirteen minus X is thirty . Right. So we just right that down, that's the total. So we've got twenty one minus X those are the ones going to Whitby, and we've got X going to both, and we've got thirteen minus X, and that's the lot. Now assume that this is assuming they all voted. They all said, Yes we do want to go. Yeah. Erm it would have been better if they'd given you some information to say, They all voted for at least one Yeah. trip, or there were four who went nowhere. Okay. So. Erm What does that give you? So it'd be erm thirty four minus two X plus X erm Okay. Er X So how do you just I mean rather than do it in your head, especially in an exam, just what you're going to do, put the Add X to both sides say. Erm If you add X to minus X . Oh it's three yeah. Right. Let's have a little look. Thirty four equals thirty. Right. If we just take it from there. Thirty four minus X equals thirty. Now as soon as you've got a minus X and you're trying to take it over to one side, and you're trying to bring the other one over, there's a good chance that something's going to go wrong. So why not just follow a nice simple system. Thirty four minus X equals thirty. Okay. Add X to each side. They go out. Subtract thirty from both sides. Thirty four minus thirty equals thirty minus thirty add X. Okay. So X is equal to? Four. Which is what you've got there. And Yeah. Now does it add up? It should do this time if your if Is this right? We've got Let's check that. got the same answer still. Twenty one minus X If I give you some numbers to add up. If I said twenty seven add thirty five add forty nine add seventeen, would you add them up like that? Or might you put them one under another? Yeah I'd probably put the numbers Okay. So which are easier to Yes. fit ea slip easier. Twenty one minus X plus X plus thirteen minus X. Tot those up. Plus X and a minus X go out. That gives minus X. Thirty four equals thirty. Erm there may be a simpler way of doing it. Now is this right? Cos we're still getting X equals four. Add the X to each side,take the thirty off each side we've got X equals four. So what's going wrong here? Seventeen and Ah. Oh sorry nine yeah. Nine yeah. Because that comes to because that comes to nine.. Yeah that's right. And that comes to . that comes to thirty. Okay. So it does come to thirty. Erm the way you were doing it will sometimes give the right answer but the easiest way Yeah. is to make sure every box is marked in there. Let's do a slightly more complicated version. Erm scribble on here. Now let's sort this out. Erm let's see Okay. Let's see if those erm Right. This time Let's take that off. This time there are twenty nine in the class. So you've got twenty nine students in the class and fifteen want to go to Whitby,and eight want to go to Scarborough,and three little piggies want to stay at home. Three of them don't want to go anywhere. Twenty nine in the class so what I'd like to know is erm draw the Venn diagram and find out the numbers of students in every section of the diagram. And then if you can do that you can do any problem of this sort can't you? Yeah I suppose so. three. Right. Okay. So where are you going to start? Yeah but this Right. That doesn't add up to twenty nine, does it? It doesn't add up to twenty nine . Eleven. Erm Twenty six. Twenty six. Okay. Well spotted. I probably mean nineteen or something. Let's have a look. Erm Erm Okay. Seven seven don't want to go anywhere. Right. Seven don't want to go anywhere. Right. Okay. That's great. Erm that's So you've got the various sections of the diagram. You've got the Whitby lot, the Whitby and Scarborough, Scarborough and the don't want to go anywhere. When when you when you add them up just if you just put them under each other, it makes it very easy. So keep the numbers That goes there. that's it keep the numbers under the numbers and the Xs under the Xs. Okay it's twenty nine right. So an X plus er So X equals one. Okay. What will that give us? That's Fourteen and seven is twenty one. Fourteen that was sent to me by the the people who want the stuff. So Oh right yeah. . Okay what does that come to? Er twenty twenty nine Twenty nine. Now you might think, Erm oh a bit finickity saying do it this way, but it's a good system. Erm also when you're when you're adding up if you get this fifteen minus X, right, eight minus X and you're putting You just cross those. the numbers underneath each other and the Xs underneath each other, plus X, and then the plus sign X. well that goes with the numbers. Yeah? Then when you add them up You don't get confused. So I can just Mm. take these two off. Because there are Mm. so many, it's very very easy to do. Yeah. Lots of people'll finish up with, Oh that's a three X and they'll put plus three. Mhm. And this way it's more obvious what's going on. There's going to be a minus X left over there, and then you can add those up. Thirty minus X equals, how many were there, twenty nine. And it more or less does itself. Yeah. So as I said, if I give you a list of numbers, say two- or three- digit numbers Yeah. in a long line,horizontally, you'd think, Oh I'd like to put these vertically Yeah. and do a nice little adding up on it. So why not do it with Xs, because there's more chance of an error. Now why it's a good idea to do it that way So I don't in me head like and mixed up. Again in an exam, there's more chance that you make a little slip, because there's little bit of extra edge. nerves like. A similar one. Erm this time everyone's at Wembley and you're asking people,Right, if you draw this time we draw three big circles in the middle of Wembley,okay,and ask people to come and say which football team they think is a good one. So we've got Liverpool, Everton and Tranmere Rovers. So they say The instructions to the crowd are, If you think Liverpool is a a good football team, stand anywhere in that circle, Everton in that circle, Tranmere Rovers, stand in this one. And we get something like this. Erm and let's say there are a few a few awkward ones here er who don't think any of them Yeah. are a good team. So those who think Liverpool is a good one,standing in in that circle, we've got say twelve thousand. Okay. In the Everton circle we've got say fourteen thousand. And in the Tranmere circle we've got erm twenty thousand say. Okay. And we've got thirty thirty thousand people there altogether. Now so I want to know the sort of the numbers in all the boxes. Now Right. talk about it a bit before you start it. Erm is it similar to the problem you've done? Is it harder? Is it much harder? Well it's just erm it's like doing three of the previous ones isn't it like? Yeah. How are you going to sort that out? Erm well I'll start off labelling these W X Y Z. Right. And er label this. That's . So as you're labelling it, what do you think of the problem? Erm it's er Do you think it's easy or very much harder than the last one or just er pretty difficult eh. No. You're not going to be able to just look at it and write down something equals two X are you . No. You've got to really work out what's what. Right. Okay. So you've labelled your diagram and you this one is that minus W minus Y minus X so on. Erm it's a bit a bit awkward-looking isn't it? Yeah just a bit. Could you have labelled it in a way that would sort of help yourself more? Make it a bit simpler. those three added together, so W plus X plus Y plus plus the er the rest of E equal fourteen thousand. Yeah. Okay. So what's your next step from there? Oh right, I write it down on the paper. So erm Okay. And how many equations are you going to get do you think? Erm . About. About. Okay. All right. Hundreds. About hundreds. Erm No erm Well okay let's look at it another way. How many equations would you l would you like? Mm about one. Just one or two. Erm If I gave you a problem about sort of prices of apples and pears I suppose it no I suppose erm two W plus two three Y plus X plus Z Mm. If I said erm, Ten pears plus six apples costs two pound forty, Yeah. how much does one apple cost? what would you say to that? You can't really do it really. Why not? Cos you've got two unknowns. And? And only one equation. Right. So that give you any ideas about this . You got to have two two equations. Two equations. How many unknowns have we got? Erm. Three four five. No. That the I've got I I know these. You know those. I've got four unknowns there. So you've got four unknowns, so you're going to need Four equations right? Does that sound a bit daunting? Yeah. Well so four simultaneous equations. Mhm. And they won but they won't be difficult cos they're all linear. Yeah. They're all there're no X squareds or W squareds or anything else in. . But you can do them. So with with that, you know how much the total comes to, thirty thousand. Right. So I could put Oh aye yeah, W plus e Y plus X plus E equals fourteen thousand. Mm. And erm . Have you used Say in the first one, Yeah. Er you didn't use that. So can you use can you think of an equation that involves that? The total people. Well tell me tell from your diagram, what's the total? Thirty thousand that are there. Right, but that okay ? Oh just these added up? Okay. So don't forget the one thousand who don't think any of them are a good team, add all those up and that will give you a fourth equation. Yeah. And all you need to do then is to find one of these in terms of the others and substitute in, and it'll come out fairly easily. Now you can choose these erm slightly differently. For example you've got lots of got lots of minuses in. What you could have done say was this one here that's marked E doesn't have to be all of those who supported Everton, it could be just that bit. Yeah. Right. And you can an expression for it then in terms of that. But there's no reason why you stop at three. It could have been twenty five different variables Yeah. there are in real problems. Erm With two it's not too difficult. I mean sometimes you can almost just try an intelligent guess and maybe Yeah. about the third guess you try you get the right answer. With that, there's not much chance . No. Okay. Erm so you need to develop a system that's going to always give you a method and is always making the work easier for you and not getting you lost. Okay. So that's enough I think Mm. on that to sort of show you the power of the system we were just using to erm The obvious thing to do is to label every area of the diagram, and don't forget they do sometimes say, Seven were not interested in Yeah. in anything. Label every area and then use what they give you about the total number. The total was thirty pupils,add all that lot up equals thirty. And when you were doing these with lots of you've got now got W X Y and Z in,when you're adding up if you lay them out like that Right yeah. with the Ws under the Ws it's you'll find that those horrible looking equations will simplify quite nicely cos there'll be a plus W and a minus W. I see yeah. And you'll get things that you know you'll get an equation just in X then . So it'll be erm so fourteen thousand minus W minus Y minus X Mhm. and the next one then twelve thousand minus W Mm. minus Y, then Yeah. miss that gap plus Z That's it. Exactly. And then that one Right, you've got it. two thousand plus Yeah. Y and X and Z. So although it looks like, Ooh this is horrible, four equations four unknowns, I'll be here all night And then it's not cos you're just . I've got You're eliminating one at a time. Yeah. Once you've got that fourth equation in from all this lot adds up to the total, and that's the one that you seem to be forgetting, that's the one you've got to try and remember. Okay? So shouldn't be any problem on those. This one er I wasn't too sure either. Mm looks like geometry to me. Mm yeah yeah. So A B is parallel to D C. Calculate the values of erm write down possible Okay. Erm it's geometry. That's the answer to that, Yeah. basically. It's something that I usually say, Leave till the last. It is a Did you spend much time on that? No I j just had a l er Good. er an attempt and then I thought, No I'm not Good. gonna It's a waste of time . It's it's it's the sort of thing that I would always recommend And there's only about three marks for it anyway so. Exactly. Leave your attempt till the end. So rather than you going well on this nice question, and you could you could have done it and picked up Yeah. another sort of six marks or maybe eight marks for the the end bit of the question, erm you'd spent a bit of time on this. Anything to do with geometry unless you've had a lot of practice and you're very good at it, you can finish up wasting time. Yeah. So I would say, Have a go but leave it till last, when you when you've done everything else and maybe you when you've just checked through to see if the others are okay. So let's have a a little look here. Political party making election promises. Erm was that one alright? Yeah. That wasn't too bad. Eight percent every year. a hundred and seventy five billion. Mhm. Erm put it over a hundred times the eight. Okay. And then you add that onto that. And the next Right. year you get Now. Okay. Erm Mm, yeah that's good. And did you do it that way, you worked out the percentage and added it on? Yeah. Added it on after Right. What's Start off with a hundred pound Yeah. and add twenty percent on. Yeah. What's the final amount ? Hundred and twenty. Okay. Start off with a hundred pounds and add thirty five percent on. So a hundred and thirty five pounds yeah. Okay. Start off with erm two hundred and add thirty five percent on. What's your final answer ? Erm two Two hundred Okay. and seventy. So how are you working it out? It's erm two hundred over a hundred Two hundred and then work out thirty five over a hundred of that, Er work out what that comes to, which is seventy, and then add your two hundred on. Okay. Well if we do something like what we finish up with is thirty five percent of two hundred of two hundred okay, plus a hundred percent isn't it? Yeah. Of two hundred. So what does that come to? A hundred and thirty five percent. Oh I see yeah. Okay. . So if you want to So it's if you when especially as you're going to do it on your calculator anyway, . what would you multiply to get the answer straight off? What would you multiply that two hundred by? One three five and then percentage. One point Three oh three five . three five. Yeah, or a hundred and thirty five percent as you said. Yeah. Erm if you find you've got a calculator without a percentage key, and some of them haven't, especially Yeah. some of the scientific ones, mine's got one. erm you can just do that . . So if I wanted to find out erm Let's do that one with the the N H S, and this time I want to know how much it's going to be It starts off at a hundred pounds. Yeah. A hundred billion. Okay, just call it a hundred. And we increase it by ten perc Well let's say we increase it by It's not out money is it, so let's really spend it and increase it by fifty percent every year. Yeah. What would you multiply that by, that hundred? One point five. Okay. So do that try that on your calculator. So what did you get? hundred and fifty pound. Right. So while that's still in, times one point five again. . Well you've still got your one fifty in, so times one point five. So two hundred and twenty five right. And leaving that in, times one point five. That's three hundred and thirty seven point five. So you can see how they as if they ask you to do it over three years or five years or something You just keep on doing that yeah. you don't you're not doing several operations and putting some in memory and bringing it back and giving yourself lots of chances of making mistakes. No. It's just multiply it by that constant thing each time. And with most with a lot of calculators I mean you Don't try it unless you really know your calculator and know how it works, you can just keep pressing equals, Yeah. and it does the last thing you've done times the Yeah. say do it once and say we want six years, put equals equals equals Yeah. more times. Erm if you're going to use =thing something like that in the exam I mean there's no reason why you shouldn't use that multiplying it by one point whatever the percentage is. Yeah. What would you have multiplied it by if it was erm the eight percent? One point eight. One point Well what would you Oh ze oh zero eight, yeah sorry zero eight . Yeah, okay. That's the only thing to watch, that. Yeah cos that'd be Eigh eighty percent that'd be eighty percent yeah. eighty percent is one point eight but eight percent, okay seven percent one point O seven. That's the only snag with that, that you you can get the wrong But it's very much way of doing it . Yeah. Okay. Solve the equation. That's pretty straightforward that. Expand that. You can do that. Yeah. so much for its call-out fixed charge plus the time. That's okay. Yeah. Yeah? And then working backwards. It costs Yeah. sixty five pound And then just er just changing the subject there like. Right. Now if we put that on there. Erm I dunno this is somebody else's paper so This is before I had a I worked it out as I I th I thought it'd work out a three- four-five triangle. Mm. Did you work out it was a ninety degrees? Erm yeah well I I Why? I realized that cos Why? Cos it looked it? No cos erm the here you've got this in a semicircle, Right. and if it's touching Okay. the top it's always ninety degrees . Did you say that on the paper? Erm I just put a little arrow with ninety degrees in the semicircle . Mm. Cos it looked it. Erm wh what they're looking for in this answer is erm Because it's the angle in the semicircle angle B is ninety degrees. Yeah. And then carry on and do the other bit. Erm you know you can look at that or you can put a protractor on it and Mm. think Well that's ninety, but you need to say that it is ninety because it's the angle in there. Yeah. Okay. Right. So you'd probably get minimum marks for that . three marks for that anyway. Mhm. What did you think of this? I looked at it and I er panicked. Then I looked at it again and I realized that it wasn't too hard. Mm. I mean I got er the only th part erm I did mess up a bit was the the part here. Mm. Cos I got this the wrong way round. But other than that I got the right. Right. Now this this what I'd like you to do,is read it out but only read the absolute bare bones of it. We don't want to hear anything about Janet having trouble with her bike and Janet a powerful young woman or riding the race of her life , or any don't want Yeah. any of that. It's just rubbish. When you when you're reading this through, you're having a quick skim through, you can can you can cross out, you can sort of totally obliterate Yeah. what you don't want to know because it's One of the problems here is there's so much noise. Yeah. There's so much random stuff that you don't just details irrelevant . yeah. You don't want to know that she was wearing odd socks and one of them was green, it's Mhm. nothing to do with drawing the graph of distance against time. So what are the important points in that ? That they set off neck and neck. Okay set off neck and neck. Right. Alright. Then Janet took the lead then overtaken ten seconds later. Mhm. Then built up a lead of fifty metres. Right. And so she behind all the way but caught up with her a few metres Before the end. before the end. Oh just before the finish, fifty metres from the finishing line. And then Janet overtook her just before the finishing line. Right. So all this about the North Rose Trophy and it's just When you see You f you said you felt like panicking. Yeah. You're in middle of an exam, you're trying to do everything very quickly, and there's a great long screed of text Mm. to plough your way through. Erm so get sort of practise reading it so you can cut out the irrelevant stuff. And a good thing as I say is to just erm highlight the stuff that you want if you've Yeah. got a highlighter, or maybe underline it, and maybe even cross out. Yeah. Because you rea you're going to read this about three or four times aren't you? Yeah. before you understand what on earth is going on here. They started off neck and neck. They started off together. Okay. This one goes in the lead and then stops and then the other one goes in the lead and then she puts a spurt on and catches up. You'll read that sort of round and round a few times before you get it straight in your head what's Yeah. going on, and you don't need all this garbage in it as well. So your first time through you can cut some of that stuff out, and then you've got it. You've got the bones of the problem. Then you can work with it. Erm so do you think you got it sorted out roughly? Even I mean you didn't quite get it sorted out in the exam but No. did you think that you know what you've done wrong now, Yeah. and how to do it? Yeah. There's there is often something on distance time graphs and also quite often it's like that. Now I think that's not a maths question. No. No. That's an English question. Yeah. I mean if you I don't know if you know of anyone whose standard of English is quite poor No. but their maths are okay. Mm. Now that's quite an unfair question. Cos if they can't read through a lot of text and sort it out they haven't got much chance . No. They just sit there mesmerized for half an hour and then Right time's up. Okay. So you're alright on trine time train Yeah. train timetables. Mm? You just draw a line of best fit you know line of best fit through erm all the points well Okay. the one that goes nearest the majority of points. One goes nearest the majority of points. Okay. So if you've got a load of points all here Mm. and there's one stray off here, you'd go through that way, the line of best fit. Ignore any strays. Mm. Okay. How about the gradient of the line? That's like the average what is it it's a Distance so it's the average speed that's been travelled throughout the journeys. Mm. Erm the gradient of a line okay, there's a there's a bit of graph paper. Okay X is and there's a line. What's its gradient? Erm the change in the Y Okay it so change in the It it's so measure measure the gradient of that and tell me what it is. I'll make it so they're nice and e even. Now you said you'd make it even. Yeah. What did you mean by that? Oh t I had two point nine by three Mm. by seven point nine. Okay. The one you made nice and easy was the nice and even was the Y. Yeah. Which one are you going to divide by? The Y, so change in Y over change in X so Mm. You're going to divide by the X . Oh yeah, best off doing the Yeah. It doesn't matter cos you can . . Better get rid of that line yeah. Probably pencil . Okay. And what does that come to roughly ? It's about erm two point eight. Right. Two point eight Seven centimetre. So that's erm . . What's what's the units? I don't know it's just whatever the Well what have you done? What did you do? Oh I cha I divided Y over You divided Divided the change in Y So many millimetres Yeah. by another number of millimetres Oh right, oh millimetres that's it yeah . and what's the answer? Erm millimetres . Millimetres divided by millimetres is what ? Yeah it's millimetres square. Millimetres erm the other one. What is it? Erm What's X divided by X? One. Er one X. Just X. Just one. It's just millimetres . No it's just one. It's not millimetres, it's nothing. It's just a number. So that's just millimetres then yeah . It's millimetres divided by milli No, it's not millimetres. No this . The answer is not in millimetres. The answer is just a number. Oh right. It's a ratio of one length to another. Okay? Yeah. Find the ratio of that height to that length. Mm. Okay. And let's say it's a third. Mm. It's not a third of metre, a third of a millimetre or a third of a kilometre, it's just a third, the ratio of that length to that one. Okay? I see. So the ratio of that length to that one is point four. But the gradient the gradient of the hill erm you could express it in terms of an angle couldn't you? Yeah. If I say, Is that hill very steep? Ooh yes, about forty degrees. So if we look at this Twenty five. Twenty five. Find the tan of twenty five degrees. It won't be in centimetres or millimetres, it'll just be a number . Two point four six. Right. Six three . That's a much more accurate way of finding the gradient. . Just find the tan of the angle. You don't have to measure. You've got two measurements here. This two point eight isn't accurate. No. It's what, plus or minus point one almost. Yeah. I mean point one of a millimetre's not much. You could be almost well you could at least plus or minus point O five. Yeah. Right. Which is a big percentage that you're And both of these could be out. One could Yeah. be too big and one could be too small, which would make a big difference. But you can measure the angle pretty accurately on that to s to within say half a degree and have its tan. Right yeah . Erm because there's your angle,there's that, and this is opposite over adjacent. So the gradient it's a ratio it's not no units to it, not metres millimetres or anything else, and it's the tan of the angle. So the gradient gives you a mea If I gave you the gradient, if I said the gradient is one, what would the angle be? Erm How would you find the angle? Just one and then do the tan backwards. Okay tan to the minus one . five. So there's a that's that's what gradient means, the tie-up between them. It's not In some cases like erm the diagram you were doing about the two girls running,erm then the distance against time gradient will give you speed, give you velocity. We've done the Roses,you're okay on the symmetry, you know about that now. Yeah. I mean if if it hadn't got a ,there's noise in the problem there's Yeah. irrelevant stuff. If you if you you strip it down to the Actually I didn't know how to do the arc . I wasn't sure how to do that. Okay. But you know now. Erm That was pretty st that the height of just a bit of It's a bit of algy and a bit of pythagoras Yeah. in together. And the area. What is how about that one? What is the square root of six point four by ten to the ten to the five? Well erm eight hundred but when I did it wrote it into normal terms like six point sixty four with one two three four noughts Mm. and then I square rooted it. Mm. Erm yeah, I square rooted it. Okay. Yeah that's a good way to do it. Mm slightly more easier for you is just multiply it by one of those tens so you've got sixty four by ten to the four. The square root of sixty then take the square root of Eight. The square root of the sixty four is eight, the square root of the ten to the four ten squared. Oh right yeah. Yeah. Erm okay. It's a good way to do it to if you think, Oh I can't really handle this going on here, put all your noughts on and then you can work out what they come to. Okay. Erm weather stations near the north pole. we should start ringing alarms bells a little bit. So what did you do for this one? Right I measured well it's seven kilometres apart so I measured the distance between them. Ah. Mm? Erm in centimetres or millimetres . And it came to five. It wasn't seven centimetres eh ? No so it's And it should have been shouldn't it? fifty millimetres. Right. Okay, so you worked out what the scale was. Yeah. And then what did you do? Erm I so it was for one So seven kilometres is equal to fifty millimetres. Mhm. I did erm Yeah. So you seven work out your scale that comes to So seven over five. And then what did you do for this next bit? It knows it's between four and three kilom kilometres away. Yeah. So er point seven one er is equal to one kilometre. Mhm. So work out the Yeah. So four kilometres so multiply point seven one by four. Yeah. You worked out what that would be and then on the one the scale and then what did you do ? Yeah I worked out what this would be on the scale. that's from T so I dr drew a line a cir a circumference . A circle. Right. So I did round there. Yeah. and a smaller one round there. Right. So you work out . what the scale is so you can set your radius and draw your two circles and say, It's in there somewhere. Yeah. Okay. That should get full marks. Yeah. Bit . Mm. Erm er that trig trigonometry there again. Mhm. And then er just work out the length of this and then the length of that and then subtract these two lengths. So that's quite a nice question. Erm Seven marks on that. Okay. Transformation. You alright on the transformation? Yeah. Yeah. You've been doing those alright haven't you . . Ah. Mm. How many of those can you get out of one of those eh? Erm How many mugs of water to fill the tank? . Okay. So you cal calculate the volume. Yeah. That one's no problem. Yeah. You think, Right I've done that with me fish tank. That one. What did you do for that? Erm I used the equation sheet which he wri wrote on the board. Right. Okay which would have been on the front of your paper . Yeah but he we didn't have any Right so as soon as you see that you think, Ah volume of a cylinder, I know, whee! straight to the front. Look at it and then erm measured it I did I d and then I redid this one and put it in the same scale, Yeah. and then erm the answer I got for this Mm. So divided it by that. you what did you you used centimetres here did you? Yeah. Right. Good. Because that thing you did with the fish tank has shown Yeah. you that you can't say, Well one centimetre is a hundredth of a metre so No. one cubic centimetre's going to be a hundredth of a cubic metre. it's obvious. It's not it might be obvious but it's not true. Okay that that's the big thing they're looking for there. Convert it to the same units, use the formula and then I mean that's a gift that isn't it? Yeah. Mm? Six marks there for nothing really. Imagine them all bringing their mugs to fill the tank . Mm. Now you've got to rework it again in cubic metres Yeah. and work out how many seconds. There's nine marks on that Yeah. really a gift wasn't it? Yeah I mean it's a it would be a joy to do it as well cos you think, I know how to do these. Yeah isn't this easy, this is relaxing. Okay. Erm I think you know there how to pick up quite a few Quite a few more marks yeah. quite a few marks without you learning anything No. that you don't know already. Yeah? Yeah It's just sort of looking at 'em a bit. Erm the geometry one that we didn't look at,you might be able to spot it in minutes, Yeah. you know seconds even. You might be still on it twenty minutes later. Yeah. So keep it for the end and keep it for when you've not only done all the questions but had a quick check through to see have Yeah. you done something daft. Yeah. Cos that's where the marks are thrown away. Not Yeah. not something you can't do but something you've done ten times before. You just make a one silly mistake like. And you just think you know you like you've put metres instead of centimetres on the the hosepipe or something like that and you think, Oh that's not right, that you will spot . Like when you write a letter and you read it through and you think, Ooh I've missed a word out here, Mm. or I've you know run two words in together or something. So that few minutes at the end is important for picking up these extra marks you've been trying to throw away,okay, where you can do it, and the few minutes at the beginning is to look through and find that question wherever it was, that one on the last page. Lot of marks going for it, dead ea And again it's a s it's a joy to do this sort isn't it. Yeah. Cos you can see where you're going all the way through, Yeah. you know that you know it it's nice It's just like nice and easy. and you feel really confident about it, you think, Wow this is piling up the marks . So look for the good ones don't spend too much t There'll only be one little geometry thing Yeah. fiddling about with triangles and circles and stuff like that. So have a go And it's only about two or three five marks. Exactly. So have a go at it when you've done the others. Okay. Well I'd better get off. another one to get to soon. That's mine. That's yours. Right. Practise with that protractor, Yeah. so that you get used to it so that you prefer to use it to the other one. Have have have both , but if you've got bearings It easy to b better . use that . If someone gives you a polygon to draw Yeah. Use that cos it's not not fiddling Yeah. around twisting it. I mean in the time is takes you to do a sketch you can draw accurately Be easier to . draw round it,dot dot dot,draw even if you then sketch it without using a straight line, if you just join up the dots freehand , Yeah. you get a very good sketch and you can see what's going on and you can see the angles. . That's your one. Erm Next week. What's happening about that? Where are we ? I'm on holiday then so er You're on holiday. Right. Yeah. Okay. So is that for What about the week after that? Erm no I think I've got about two weeks off. Okay, so I'll see you erm So we break up on Wednesday that's Friday Friday, So three Fridays. Three Fridays. Yeah.. So I'll see you in about I'd better work out what the date is. Erm Can have a look on the calendar in there. Okay. And probably be an idea if you remind me sometime during that week when I'm due to see you. Alright yeah I'll give you yeah . Just give me a just give me a ring. But er we'll we'll skip the next three then. Alright yeah. Okay. I better remember my tape recorder. Okay. Erm I've found out when the exam is. Yeah? It's erm right at the end of the month of the rest of the exams. Okay. So erm Yeah it's well well at the end of the month. So have you got what's what's the best Morning Mrs . Good morning Doctor. Well now, what can I do for you today? I've been coming for sh three weeks now. And I came to ask the doctor if I could get H R T. And she took my blood pressure and it was too high She chased you. so she didn't give me anything the first time, but she Mhm. The second time. The second time, it was a different doctor again, and she gave me tablets and I can't remember the name. It was I just took the last one on Saturday, and I then threw the Aye. The wee white ones, Aye. Right. Brusc something Aye. So Right. Show us your muscles. Let's see what you're doing to your poor old self. I don't know why I think maybe the, the tablets helped, but erm I was saying I was kind of having second thoughts whether I was wanting to go on the H R T or No. No. No chance. No chance. Not, not with your blood pressure up like that. No er well she didn't say much, but she Well, no chance I can tell you now. Whenever er Just get yourself down. And I thought er and er I had wee tablets that you gave hypothetical transfer of an asset from a Liechtenstein trust to the U K trust and that asset had no valuation done on it as far as I can make out a and no reference to any valuation appeared in the accounts, so we actually had B I M apparently owned by a charitable trust on the face of it with figures of five hundred and one thousand of assets, but in practical accounting terms and valuation terms, no evidence that those five hundred and one thousand pounds er of assets had any valuation approaching that figure. Can now, can we actually move on a bit because, that has been very valuable what you said, but in fairness to Mr Maxwell it also has to be said doesn't it that up until he stole these assets er this process of throwing organisations, peoples monies into a spin dryer and pulling them out of different sort of sequences was something he regularly did and we've had witnesses to say how well he did manage the funds and how they grew, whether when they should sell stock and when they shouldn't sell stock and so on. So we're actually concentrating on the actual business of that in the final analysis, despite how he behaved, large amounts of funds were stolen and you b you've kicked us off to a very valuable start about whether that would be harder to do faced with a Maxwell-type character if all of Good was implemented. So w we're grateful for that. We'd also for those new pieces of the puzzle you've given us today over erm Liechtenstein. But can I take the questions back to Jimmy please and continue. Well obviously the sad reality of the thing doesn't come home to, to our countrymen and a man comes up last week and tells me that he's been paid off by the Daily Record he's been working for them for thirty five years and he asked what how much pension will he have and says that he's getting four years pension. Now that's a s er sad reality of this er national fraud that er Maxwell committed. Now what I'm saying to you is that there's a big question mark as far as Goodey er report is concerned and they can talk about er the surpluses, they can talk about the trustees, but there's no majority as far as the employees are concerned and this was the question mark that we we were saying that one of the reasons why they were saying you know that the employee should be in the minority because in the end paragraph of the summing up of the Goodey report that states quite clearly that all the responsibility and all the but the employer, now you yourself has said that er as far as the schemes and we're talking of something in the region of a hundred and twenty eight thousand. Now say for instance that because of the minimum solvency er agreement the employers have got to pay whatever their loss is, and if and I asked this question of the T U C that if there was a situation of where the employees were in the majority and forget the pension regulator, because there was a regulator anyway, so you can add whatever name that y you liked to have, but the fraud still went on, but say the employees were in the majority as far as the trustees is concerned and they were in full control and the control was taken away from the employers and there was a a federation of the hundred and twenty eight thousand with a central fund paying off heavy loss of any minimum solvencies, then surely that would be the ideal situation in order to safeguard, because when I asked Goodey himself when he submitted his report, he said they could not give any categ categorical assurance that nobody could defraud in any scheme under the proposals he's made. As far as I'm concerned personally, I think it's very, very weak,take it back and re-draft it and allow the employees to be in the control of their own destiny, because after a national fraud and a scandal that's taken place that we could never trust any employer to carry out a scheme. If I can please er I think our comments on that er perhaps Mr Ray is being er using the grob global flays when he refers to employees. In the pension scheme there are typically three groups of members, the existing pensioners er those people who are still working for the company, the employees and the third group of er members who work for the companies generally referred to as deferred members. They all have interest in the scheme so that we would believe the thing to do would be to have at least an equal number of employer appointed trustees and employee appointed trustees and the employee in this, I'm using it globally, so it does cover all three groups and we also believe it would be advisable because er inevitably the e er members er probably wouldn't know a lot about pensions themselves to have an independent trustee from an independent company who specialises in pensions and pensions laws and could a advise them on exactly what the law says and what they they're legal duties etcetera are. Yeah, but you know that the Goodey report makes it quite clear that the employer is responsible for starting the scheme, winding up the scheme and increasing or decreasing the contributions. Good d Good does in fact do what you said and his recommendation er for final salary schemes is er a third of the trustees should be or have the right to be er from the, the members and er er we've in our er comments to you have er looked at a global point of view and said no not are these proposals worthy in themselves, but using a different criteria that if they had been law as Ken said earlier, would they have stopped Maxwell and a situation where a third of the trustees were er were they members er would have made no difference er cos typically in our cases there were originally about four trustees er and unfortunately for us, three of them were named Maxwell. little further. Peter? Well, yes, just to look at the wh the question of balance of power between the employer on the one hand and the members on the other hand and then between the different categories of members the active payers-in, the pensioners and the deferred pensioners. How do you see the proposals in the er Good Report and what what exact proposals do you have yourselves? Well the proposals in the Good Report as I said for final salary schemes is that a third of the trustees should be elected from he actually says from the active members er we know and comments that in great length a about the difficulties that it would be to er actually er elect er er members who are pensioners or from the deferreds Er I find that er somewhat simplistic view point in that er er the pensioners at least get communications from the administrators of the scheme every month, they get a monthly cheque, so it sh shouldn't be beyond the wit of man to be able to er be able to contact the pensioners and organise pensioner meetings but pensioner trustees to be elected. postal balance easily enough. In fact I think oddly enough I think the way that the Daily Mirror Trustees are now organised with postal balance and representatives classes, I think you know is almost a model now of how a set of trustees should run, you know, they but they have got a very good scheme of how they do actually elect their trustees from various groups of of members. But do you envisage the employers should be in a position of the minority on the scheme? Well I think the whole problem is erm is really we should some someone's got to ask the question are are final, final salary schemes going to last well into the next century. You know because if you are going to ask an employer to enter into a contract between the between an individual employee, then really you've got to give him some advantages to do that and I think that er I don't know what the figures are or the number of final salary pension schemes that have been launched in the last couple of years, but I should think it be, be quite few and I think that there is a difficulty that if we go too far in taking power away from the er from the employer, erm then I, I can see the demise of final salary pension schemes, so I think one's got to keep a balance there of erm you know that i that you mustn't turn the employee off completely from this type of scheme. That's very clear, thank you. David Shaw. Ken, if we could er look at what's actually happening out there to pensioners at the moment, I think of which we're all very concerned, but there has been a small item of good news to balance against the concerns we have for those pensioners that are still suffering from uncertainty and that is some money has started to come in as a result of legal actions and settlements out of court. Can you tell me what the current position is as you understand it Yeah. and what your views are on some of these settlements that have been made? Yes well, erm I think I mean I I did check with the various trustees last week and the current position is erm there was basically a four hundred and sixty million that er that was the original missing figure, to which now goes back over two years er recoveries have come to into over a hundred thousand now with the Hundred million Hundred million, sorry er I got th I I missed off the nought on the end erm It's erm and yeah, er but that was his speciality er so it's so of that four hundred and sixty million er a hundred million odd er just over a hundred million has been recovered, but unfortunately we still have three hundred and eighty million of liabilities erm that is due in part to the fact that with low interest rates really the liability value has increased. So you know there the recoveries are very good, very welcomed by us, but basically we're two years now since this happened erm pensioners have been suffering extreme mental turmoil for that period, quite frankly they're, they're utterly confused, they don't understand what's happening and to ask those sort of people to rely and put their s their, their whole future security on the outcomings of out of court settlements where claims are made for two hundred million and there's a thirty two million you know they're getting totally confused and I think that that they just do not know what's happening, they, they want long-term security, we're now getting an increasing number of people who've retired since the schemes were wound up and are therefore getting a hundred per cent of their, their money from the company fund, which we're told is going to run out in two-and-a-half years time. So we've got this group of people who are and just retired, they're sixty-five and have just retired, and they're looking forward to their pension le lo losing completely in two-and-a-half years time unless something's done about it. I think that's a near suicidal situation. Can I just make one point Ken, cos you were saying they're getting thirty odd million of er of a request of two hundred million. It was actually thirty million wasn't it of a claim for fifty million, of which there was also a secondary claim which was dropped. Yes, yes I think So that so that actual that particular settlement was rather a good one, because it was thirty odd million plus eight wasn't it? Oh yes, yes, no, I think I think that er and I think that you know that particularly the the Mirror Group Newspapers Trustees doing a doing an excellent job you know, but we haven't really got into the into the stock lending er arrangements, but the, the cases those I think are particularly you know important to us you see, because there is a there's another hundred and fifty nine or a hundred and fifty three million I think of, of writs out at the moment and those I think are the ones where we're going to really see whether the, the banks dig their heels in or not, you know, I think we've, we're rea very early stage, but basically I mean we've still got eighty, getting on for eighty per cent of the missing monies still missing and we're into our third, third year. Ken, would you say though that erm one or two recent announcements connected with these judgments, I think including the er the judge in a recent M C C case which actually went I think against the administrators,b on shares but actually the judge said if the argument had been made that er these assets were held er on a trustee basis, then I might have made a different decision. Er would you not say that this has shifted the onus of responsibility very much on to the financial institutions, the banks and others who had dealings with Mr Maxwell, and isn't the judge in effect saying in your interpretation er of that, that these institutions er really have got to show they were whiter than white in their dealings and actually went in and investigated him thoroughly? Well I think I, I mean I do agree and I think that the that er that pressure is now getting on to these, these city institutions, but erm, but I still come back to the basic thing that, that really, you know what appears to me is happening is we've we're having literally millions of pounds taken out in, in issuing these massive massive writs you know, a hundred and seventy eight page writs are sort of being and really the money for those is coming out of the remaining money in our pension funds and really I feel that what wou what is happening is this, as far as I'm concerned, is all due to the self-regulatory body being set under the Financial Services Act, and in a way I feel that you know we're being made to pay for sorting out a mess that somebody else is making. I mean and I think it is the lack of the regulate the er the regulatory control of city actions, I mean one of the points that we've been recently been advised on is that one of the city institutions which has already been er fined, er from its London office on a technicality is in effect the New York and London offices are deemed to be one entity and I think that er what we've been advised is that erm I forget the phrase, I wrote it down here somewhere, that what we would be advised to do is to take action against that particular city institution in New York, because that er it is deemed that the London and New York actions are in fact one and that the that er what in fact the er and I think the f yes, there it is, that, that in a way though what we've been advised is that the basis of that action would be that the organisations London and New York operations are essentially the same operation and bound by a strict know your customer rule as mandated by U S Securities Law, you know. Now I can see the sense of that, you know, we could probably go to a New York lawyer on a no no win, no pay basis and take action agai an and argue that case, but you know is this what, what really people who've paid pensions for thirty or forty years should be dealing with, you know. It was, can I just bring you back to that point Yes. that particular organisation I presume is, is the one that is known as the most profitable investment bank partnership in the world or in history and presumably the reason why you've been advised is because the advisor or the director to Robert Maxwell who was instrumental in dealing with Robert Maxwell business wherever he was in the world and I mean I've seen er faxes and cables to France where er that particular director, I believe Mr Shineberg was, I've seen faxes about Jersey business to Mr Shineberg er presumably er you're being advised to take that action because in effect it was operating as one operation with transactions routed through New York, routed through London as seemed to suit the circumstances, but not necessarily with any rational basis other than er to avoid perhaps regulation. Er Ken, you don't have to answer that the David sitting behind you a number of er representatives of legal firms representing interest and David's making sure it's worthwhile coming today. Chairman, I can't imagine how you could possibly contemplate that. No, I think, I think The interesting point is that, that I feel is, that this is, this, this, this all has a very heavy bearing on the regulatory system, because I think that really we're now being financial services is a global village and you know whether somebody picks up a phone and di I think in fact didn't you have somebody gave evidence here and said that they could not investigate one of Maxwell's transactions, because it had gone through the New York office. Now if we're going to try and eliminate the prob the sort of problems, then really we've got to think of on an international regulatory basis, rather than just in the U K. David? Can I bring you erm back to the U K and what we can do in the U K, although I agree with you, we need to be looking with certain organisations at regulation on a Trans-Atlantic basis, but from a U K point of view, erm the Good Committee Report has suggested that a pensions regulator should er be brought into being. Do you think that if we had a pensions regulator, er it might deal with some of the exploitations by Robert Maxwell er and some of the er aspects of where he breached the law and managed to take over pension funds. I suppose in asking that question I've got to ask you to rule out er all transactions er which have sort of transacted through New York and London at the same, or, or at different times, because quite clearly the Good Committee would er all their suggestions would fail on that behalf You've just destroyed the question I was going to ask you really before I got to the question. No I don't think so, no I don't think so. I mean th there's one little phrase that I picked out of Good which o regarding the, the pension regulator and he actually used the word that he envisages the pension regulator and I now quote will be less pro-active than the F S A regulators. How you can be less pro-active than I M R O I can't understand or I M R O at that particular time, but what it appears to be me is that erm that if we're not careful, we're gon th the pension regulator's just gonna be a rubber stamp factory. You know, it's got a hundred and twenty eight thousand pension schemes, papers are gonna flood through the door and annual reports and that sort of thing and it seems to me that all of Goods th the way that this, this pension regulator is deemed to act is that he's expecting the auditors and the actuaries to whistle blow and Well, well I think I would, I would rath it I mean i it they've got the responsibility to whistle blow now, you know, professional they've got, er you know, they're they these are professionals and they should, they should whistle blow and I mean Maxwell is a perfect example of how nobody, nobody blew the whistle and if you read through the writs, those lots of these people knew what were what was happening an and the whistle should have been blown and I see no reason why the why the pension regulator is going to get any different, different response and also I mean really these people are being in many cases given by th given information by their clients, you know, and I think it's a very difficult situation to turn round to, to somebody like Mr Maxwell and say well look I'm terribly sorry Mr Maxwell, we're going to report you to the pensions regulator, you know and I think that, that er you will just find that that I just don't feel that the pension regulator in, in that respect, I mean I, I think that I might like to if Peter suggested a pension fraud squad that, that had a open telephone line and the same sort of er powers as the Serious Fraud Office you know, so that if er anybody in a pension fund could, could ring a number and er and people absolutely descended th that, I mean they ge they say somewhere in the report that the pension regulator is going to have er powers and monies to do spot checks. Well how on earth do you start spot checking on a hundred and twenty eight thousand companies you know, the first nine hundred and ninety five that you do may be the ones that are running perfectly. Can I just put to you there that the pensions regulator may be able to handle aspects like audit reports and established well established documentation and procedures, but are you not really suggesting erm that in the circumstances of Maxwell where the Committee saw for example a transaction that actually had thirty different transactions and therefore unless one looked at the overview of those thirty transactions, one couldn't realise that the bank effectively was involved in a fraud. They're a very well known bank, but nevertheless effectively involved in a fraud. Now how is a pensions regulator going to look at those thirty transactions, therefore are you not effectively saying that the pensions regulator may work in areas where pensions regulation actually works now. The problem is the pensions regulator won't work in the areas where regulation isn't working now. Absolutely. Yeah. I think that's I understand the point you're making about er self regulation and er I think it's brought a lot of the problems upon us and enabled the frauds to take place er and that's what de-regulation and self regulation leads to. What would be your proposals for controlling pension funds? Well I think if er if what had ha if er I mean before what he had before self regulation was the D T I issued erm certificates to investment management organising, you know, and I think that if er if power had remained on that basis with the D T I, I don't I'd be sitting here now. I don't think the I don't think the D T I would have issued a investment management certificate to Robert Maxwell you know because he'd done naughty things in the past, so he just wouldn't have got the certificate. I mean it was what, what and if you go through all the papers you can see that, that Robert Maxwell really saw that self regulation erm legislation being that he could finally get control through an investment management company of his pension funds. Were the D T I open to erm pressure, suggestions, information from members of pension funds I don't know, but I er, no I think I don't know I'm not you know, my experience of pension funds is it's, it's you know is only in the last two years really, I'm er. You're an expert, expert over that bit maybe The other thing that might contribute to er er improving matters would be if the compensation arrangements er were such that the er fund managers were involved in having to provide some of the compensa compensation if there were any to be paid, then there's obviously a very good incentive for them to police themselves more thoroughly. Under the present compensation er proposals put forward by Good, it would all be provided by the pension funds themselves and there's no pain for the fund managers er no requirement really for them to blow the whistle. Clifford? No the erm none of your papers to the committee concentrated on the the compensation er proposals from the Good report, and as you know it's a scheme er which is proposed to be restric restricted to losses ari arising from fraud, theft and intentional misappropriation of assets and is just up to a limit of ninety per cent. How do you consider that the proposals for that scheme offer adequate cover er to members of pension schemes? No we don't, erm we in principle obviously we are in favour of er there being some form of compensation scheme and that has to be regarded as erm a step forward, er it would be better if er whatever compensation scheme is gonna be introduced was introduced now and the committee recommended and not in nineteen ninety-six or whenever it may be that the legislation is enacted. Er but in in terms of the proposals they actually make erm we find them somewhat contradictory in that erm it says earlier on in the in the committees report that erm accrued rights must be protected erm, it doesn't say accrued rights which have to be lost through misappropriation of assets must be protected. Whereas the proposals that they're making is only those rights which may be lost because of misappropriation of assets er would be compensated by the compensation fund. We feel it should be extended to all assets er all, all accrued rights that are not able to be provided. Erm we believe that er where in cases of erm misappropriated or fraud, the compensation fund should be for a hundred per cent of what has gone. In cases where it's due to er under performance in the case of insolvency for example or other situations, we can see the argument for having a smaller proportion, but it should cover both. Does the compensation scheme cover that? No, not at present and we believe that it should. Er you think you think it should be wider then, a wider scheme. Yes absolutely wide, yes. In order to cover any er any rights which are lost and secondly er it's inevitably the case that we are particularly disappointed er that the proposals are not retrospective. After all if it wasn't for the Maxwell fraud, the Good Committee would never have been set up. Erm we feel that er in that circumstance the proposals should be retrospective erm and we find the Good Committees er comment on this singularly unhelpful, in that all they say is we do not accept that retrospective implementation of the compensation scheme is appropriate full stop. Why not? We think that it should be. Er if for no other reason than er if the compensation scheme was to be made retrospective to include the victims of the Maxwell fraud, it would at least erm restore some public confidence in the in the pensions industry. Er and after all, if all the efforts that have been made that we have discussed just at, just now, er towards getting the money back are successful, well then the compensation that had been paid would be repaid. So those are our main concerns about the compensation. Well I'm very interested in what you say er could you, could I ask you a couple of questions. How do you think the retrospective scheme compensation scheme would actually work and if I could give you an example erm should it apply to all schemes which have been affected in the past er perhaps after a certain date or if you were going to make that decision, where would the cut-off date be, how far back would you go and what schemes would you look at Er if it's gonna be retrospective? only look at er er it's a scheme that really raised the whole problem that the erm er Ken commented earlier that er er prior to the Financial Services Act coming into force which I think was some time in nineteen eighty-eight, the er D T I was responsible and there come back to the D T I if these sort of things had applied and er compensation effectively by the D T I for mal-administration or whatever so that er say we don't pretend to be pension experts, so any retrospection that I would suggest might well be appropriate as at the date of the Financial Services Act becoming into force. After all it was suggested er by er Michael Howard in who was Corporate Affairs Minister in nineteen eighty-six in, in the House of Commons he said that the Government believe that members of a pension scheme are in effect investors in that scheme and that that they deserve the protection of the Bill will extend to investors and it never did. So it would not seem unreasonable that you know, from the date of the Financial Services Act it might come in there. Would be a wide ranging scheme covering all the aspects of the We believe it should be. Could, could erm, I ask you then how you think it should be funded? Well the proposals that are made in the in the Committees er report for funding erm seem to us acceptable with the exception of the comment we have already made erm i acceptable in the sense that they would be borne by erm all pension funds in proportion to their the size of their assets and in relation to the size of the er compensation has to be paid. We believe that it would be more sensible if a proportion of the compensation would be met by people like pension fund managers if for no other reason that it would encourage them to er keep their own house in order erm and you know it's not a bad er principle to operate in these areas. Now you know,wi with lots of experts in this field and so we 're we only simply put that forward as a, a general suggestion whether it should be one-third from them and two- thirds from the pension funds, you know, I don't think is a matter of great importance to us, but we do think that the should perhaps be a bit spread, spread a bit more widely than just into the pension funds. It's probably not to yourselves providing the compensation was paid and that's fine, but it would be a matter of great importance to those for whom that it would have to provide the money. Sure. And how would you envisage that er was operated. H how would you balance that out back to the date that you're talking about? Well W w w we can see, you can visualise from now if we start it now, you'd say well, everyone now knows that if anything goes wrong, this is what they will have to pay, but how are you going to take it back? Well actually, no,I I I would disagree with you at the moment. If something goes wrong, they don't know what they are going to have to pay because if I'm a pension fund manager now, I don't know what is likely to happen in the next year which is going call on me for compensation. All I know is that probably during the course of the year something will happen and I might have to chip in you know, a thousand pounds or a million pounds or whatever, but I don't know how much it's going to be. In this case, at least it is possible to calculate the total er total amount that is missing and that could be divided up between your pension funds and it would of course be a a one-off hit on those funds. Tha that would mean that all pensioners who are drawing the pension from pension funds would be penalised back to the date that you're talking about. No, it's the employers ultimately who will be penalised because the employers are required to make up any shortfall in the assets of the funds not the pensioners. So the pen employers pay Ultimately yes. And that but al as we said, a proportion of it we believe should be met not from the pension funds, but from the er from, from managers. But if you've got er four hundred and eighty million pounds missing and you're saying that pension fund managers should er pay a third of it and this is a pay as you go scheme rather than a funded scheme of compensation, how many pension fund managers do you think would be able to cough up their third? I don't have at the tip of my fingers the total level of funds managed, but Once again there is n not necessarily er anybody to write out a cheque for one million pounds o or whatever. Most of these liabilities er inevitably aren't necessarily for pensions payments they're back to the active members, some of whom won't make any actual claim on this possibly for thirty years time, so there could well be a er a a scheme which is arrived at which is a pay as you go, which isn't any great liability o on, on any one pension scheme at any particular moment in time. I thought you were trying to actually pin responsibility not to organisations, but to people that here was Mrs Thatchers philosophy really working and market was gonna discipline pay out their own pockets. Now if I'm the fund manager and you've gotta deferred member, nobody's gonna waste thirty years for me to pay up their pension, I won't be here probably in thirty years time er so they want the money up front. They don't want me paying d you know like their pension deferred, so if you're serious about the fu pension fund managers paying, we're talking y you know earlier you said four hundred and eighty million whatever it is lost, they're paying a third, pension fund managers have got to come up with that sort of sum. Now I just don't think that's rea realistic, that's different from saying you may have a bail system, cos that's what I thought you were suggesting and for people to b come into the ring as pension fund managers, they would have to perhaps to put up securities of a million pounds each to o operate in this area and that if they behave badly, if funds went missing, if it was proved they were negligent, they would lose their million pounds bail, just as people lose bail when they don't turn up to court. Now that seems to me, that might induce er slightly might do, but I could I I think that,wha I what I thought you were saying was different from what you ended up saying and I'm not sure which I think the thing that sort of has really bugged me righ right from the start of this thing was that when this when the Financial Services Act was put before Parliament, everybody was told the Gower Report and everything said pensions are the same as assets, all your assets and must be protected as such. Th th the House was told that and that was what the situation. It then went into the City to set up their own self-regulatory and we in fact went to see Mr Redwood and he was quite he was very quite blunt about it, he said well, they considered it when they were sid considering the investors compensation scheme, but the sum involved in pensions are so great, that they could not afford to underwrite a pension er a compensation fund for pensions, so therefore there's a pension fund for for private investment, but not a pension fund er compensation fund for, for occupation. Now how how you work it on your scheme or whatever scheme comes up, it just seems to me that if you are going to have self-regulatory body, there's got to be responsibility for it and how you impose that responsibility, could I'm sure be in all sorts of different ways. We've got to find, we're taking up all very well, er Jane? Er it's really is to follow on from this debate that we're having about what should happen if a shortfall occurs, erm and we've heard, I've been listening carefully to your views about er the way in which you agree with the Good Committee that a shortfall is an employers debt, the employers responsibility to meet that shortfall and we've been talking about that shortfall should be met, but the Good Committee also concluded that er pensioners should not be regarded as preferential creditors erm and you also agreed with that. Could you explain for the record what your reasons were for arriving at that conclusion? Could you take that I think that the I think the question of that really, I'm trying to, I can't quite frankly, I think that's Mike Kirkham in this who particularly investigated that one, but I think that basically what we were really saying was on what I was saying earlier on is that if you make it too difficult for the employers, you're going to take away the incentive to run a final salary scheme, you know that you know I think basically final salary pension schemes are good for the employee, you know, I think that was what our fundamental thinking of on that was. Do you think this er really goes back to the fundamental issue which the Good Committee didn't really address which was the issue of ownership of the pension funds and assets and that whilst pensioners and to an extent employers these days regard the pension fund as deferred pay and pensions payments as deferred pay, the ownership of those funds is still left erm neither still er an argument about wh wh who owns the funds and er a lot of this follows on from that. Yes, well I think that's why you that's why I keep on trying to come back to the regulatory system, because what you really in fundamental form a pension is a contract between an employer and an individual, you know you pay me so much money and when you get to a certain age I will pay you. That's the fundamental as far as I see it of a pension fund. The problem I think comes when you go when you become insolvent, you know, and I think that's and so therefore unless we're going to come up with some system where we do insure our pensions as we do our home, then you, you, you're still back to the basic contract between a company and an individual. I think that's the the real sort of problem of trying to say the assets belong to the for the pensioner, you know I think there, there are great difficulties unless you're gonna rule out final salary pension schemes. Great. Ken I calculated you've actually given us nine major points in your submission. Now are there from our questions, issues which we've missed that you just want to touch on before we conclude? Well I think er well we've gotta er I think we've gotta few points, there's, there's one on stock lending which we think needs to be looked at. Do you wanna make a couple of comments Yes. You make some comments Er Good er concludes that er stock lending is er no different from other aspects of er the market in general er as I understand it, stock lending as far as pension funds concerned, usually works with pension fund has this collection of stocks and shares. Er financial institution is sure to meet its position, it comes to the pension fund says can you loan me th this stock in the return of which I will er pay you the equivalent sum of money plus some interest. That sounds all very well and good, the way as my reading of the at least one of the writs is concerned is that er Maxwell operated this in entirely the reverse. He er wasn't the lender, he was the borrower, he went to the bank, says can I borrow this collection of treasury bonds, which he has to put pension fund assets to stock, so he's immediately er going against his duty as a trustee cos it's costing the pension fund money this er er excess of five to ten per cent. Secondly he owes bonds were immediately sold to another part of the same part of the organisation again at a discount, so that cost the pension funds even more money, and to the final injury the payment of that cash for the er treasury bonds went to accounts which were not the property of the pension funds at all. Hence we are four hundred and eighty million and whatever is out of pocket. Er we would say that as, that as far as pension funds are concerned, stock lending in that way should be prohibited and the puerilely ca carrying on that er is that er it should be any account for a pension fund should carry the names of pension funds and any transactions involved with pension fund money whether it should be a duty of financial institutions to make sure that any account they were paying money into was a pension fund account. if I may say so is a key point isn't it that a lot of the transactions you've discussed were off-market transactions, they were unusual transactions and the financial institutions that were carrying out those transactions whether they were acting as banker or acting as broker, they would have had knowledge that those transactions were not normal market transactions. So if the law was clear that in those circumstances they should have been on notice and should have therefore watched where the money was going, there wouldn't have been a problem and are we not saying that legitimate stock lending, which I think is what Good is abou is suggesting, if carried on properly on market, would be all right, but if it immediately goes off market into the back doors and back rooms and people can't see what's going on and the financial institutions take part in that, then they are doing something that un undoubtedly is probably going to cause loss to pension funds and shouldn't there be a clear law which makes them liable in those circumstances. you were saying it was wrong anyway weren't you? Oh, I'd say it is w wrong anyway in that er I say it's the it's early er on it in the report Good defines what he determines a trustees duty and as I said to a sort of effectively ought enter into a tr transaction which immediately cost effecting kind of money rather than making money for the pension fund then it is against that duty in the first place, but it's to it should however be ma made explicit that it is against that duty saying stock lending may be okay for a pension fund, but not stock lending where the er pension fund is acting as the borrower rather than the lender. Right, Ken any other points? Er can I I started to comment on about the er, er bank accounts which are you know er my the reaction that I saw was all round the table and I think we would go further that er any company handling pension funds should carry pensions somewhere in their names and all on all their paperwork etcetera so that everybody's totally clear that they are dealing with pension funds and er to agree with a comment that you made in one of your earlier reports that er designation of ownership of shares of pension funds should be clearly er marked on those shares er that also would of er at least alerted these financial institutions, as once again that they were handling stocks belonging to pension fund and they still have ignored it in the case that er they did, but er er they would ha not had the excuse that er apparently some of them have made that er they were not aware that these were pension funds assets. I think still claiming well it's not that I didn't know, but anyway er Ken Er well we did, we were gonna raise a point on that, the clash of the regulatory rules and the duty of under Trust Law, you know, and I, I think there, there was a comment tha that I picked up with Professor Gower you know in his report which I think, where he said the Government obviously have greater confidence than I in reliance on pristine Trust Law in relation to modern commercial developments such as unit trusts and occupational pension schemes, which its founding fathers never contemplated. Now there was nothing in Good really that I think addressed this mismatch between those two types of law. Now I think that, that Good did say oh well, there is a Law Commission Report expected, but I think that you know that Good should address somewhere tha that problem of Trust Law and regulationship and then I did in fact on going through the report and er you know and also your own reports erm there's the one about designation of assets you know, which I think was a very good recommendation of yours. I think the actuarial responsibilities and the wider role of actuaries was important. I think the inde independent corroboration for actuaries was another important factor, custody confirmation by the auditors, veto of transfer of assets, independent auditors for pension funds, independent custodian arrangements, in-house investment management, you made some comments, co-ordination or the various regulators, co-ordination of the professional advisors, establishment of a pension tribunal, you know, now as far as I was concerned or on my sort of looking through it, those were all recommendations that, that you've made over your two years and I couldn't really find any response to those in Good and I think that's a you know we, we personally found that disappointing. Also I mean, we take your point and we've made it before Ken that there's a real danger of asking for a report from someone like Professor Gower and then cherry picking it, instead of actually taking the whole, because it does actually add together in some sort of coherence erm and had Professor Gower's report been accepted in its entirety, we may not have been had the pleasure of having you back again today, but thank you very much er all three of you for coming. Thank you very much. I would suggest is the timescale between these things happening and it getting to the regulator and being digested. In the present didn't understand for two years I mean told the regulator Yes, yes er whereas if there were independent trustees responsible to the regulator and they were properly trained, they would I suggest be able to smell out very quickly an malpractice and would have a group straight to the regulator, if only to call a stop for someone to have a look at it. nothing recommended to Goodey in that particular cause is of any good. I don't think so. Erm er Imperial? I M P A Cs belief is that er if you get the trustee balance right, that's the first place where the decision ought to be made, but there should be a fall back position which Good has given, which they they trustees could go to the regulator in the case of er not being able to solve things, but our feeling very much on surplus is that the money is there first for to pay pensions and until pensions are paid up to Inland Revenue levels whatever they are, then no money should go back to the company. The question of taking pension holidays in between out of surplus is a sort of mid midway position, but er very definitely we feel strongly that money should not go back to the company. We have suffered from the same thing as the other two er Abalance have said today of money being used from our surplus to provide for redundancy and erm it's been exacerbated by money being available from the people who were made, made redundant going to the company and swelling their balance sheets while all the cost side of it comes out of the pension fund and that has caused a lot of ill-feeling particularly from the older pensioners who have seen years of inflation, when their pensions were not made up to the same extent. In the old days when there was a possibility of of erm ad hoc payments made er that sort of thing was taken care of, since the takeover of the company that hasn't happened to the same extent, so there's a very strong feeling with the older pay er pensioners that they paid money into a pension scheme which now shows a surplus, but other people are benefiting from it. We need we've got lots more questions to ask you. Peter? Erm Mrs Appleby you mentioned briefly earlier the role of the regulator. How do you see the regulator doing his job with a hundred and twenty-eight thousand schemes to, to monitor? Great difficulty I would imagine. erm er well we welcome the erm er the proposal that there should be a regulator. Somebody er to whom the erm er matters could be referred to er whom er could remove trustees er who are er not acting in er the best interests er of the fund er to whom er I understand that the erm beneficiaries could er appeal if they felt that their fund was being erm used i in the wrong way, which is something that we haven't got at the moment. Erm I mean just going very, very briefly back to the question that you asked erm about this how would you stop what's happen happening is by having, we would have thought a pensioner trustee, because even the question has been asked how did it get through the union trustees, and the answer that most of them are employed and they are looking over their shoulder because jobs are going, redundancies are being made, you've got a pensioner employee er a pensioner trustee on there, and they're not looking over their shoulder for their job, they are going to do the job of a trustee and watch the fund and they would then be able to go to the regulator if they saw something that was amiss, but if somebody is employed by the firm might be very worried about doing because they're more bothered about keeping their job. Though, the case you're putting that the, the pensioner trustee er ship is more powerful than you originally put, cos up to now you've been put it in grounds that it's the trust should be repr representative of it Yes Now you're saying er rather well, that in fact that person or persons could be more independent Yes. because they're actually not worried about being sacked Yes. either erm because redundancies are coming or as Imperial Trustees found, they were just got ridden of as a way of moving them off the trust. Yeah, very good. large carrots being dangled in front of them. I mean we ought to say in our case approved our the proposals of the company, they raise no objections in which only the who raised objections, the employees didn't and in the High Court case we've just said, how can an employee be independent, when he depends upon his employer for his future work. So really what you're saying is that if we're looking at trip wires to stop things happening, there's a power a really powerful case for a pensioner trustee, but you're looking for whistle blowers. Yes. There's also a powerful case for having pensioner trustees that they will so there's far less chance of erm people twisting their arm, although they could have the carrot dangled in front of them. that's But that's the problem we all face isn't it. And we're also saying that if you have a new pensions act, the work of the regulator will be much easier. Why? You won't keep have to be going off to court to find out what is the law at that moment of time. Touche. Could I, could I turn to one of the major contributors of erm of pension fund surpluses er and that is the plight of the deferred pensioner. The person who leaves the company's employment er could I ask you, each of you in turn briefly for some comments about how you feel deferred pension rights can best be preserved, if they can be preserved at all er adequately. I suppose in one way as a pensioner I shall say what happens about you know I'm not worried about if you're a pensioner because every time one someone becomes a deferred pensioner, our surplus goes up Yes. because the liability is extinguished. Yes. I cannot see why the actuary having a liability for an employee, if that employee becomes a deferred pensioner that the actuary having a liability for the fund But don't Yes they are Can I, you the example you did before to other people was that if you worked you know your normal scheme forty years and if you worked for ten of those forty years you become deferred. Do you have a quarter of the right you would expect if you done the forty years. Is that the sort of way one should underwrite the position as a deferred pensioner Yes Yes What I think my colleague is saying is that when the actuary is assessing the commitments of the funds, he is looking at the anticipated increased earnings until the person retires and I think when the calculation is made for somebody who is er a deferred pensioner of leaving er a pension fund to take his money elsewhere a similar calculation or the same calculation should be used, the one that the actuary last used in, in looking forward and saying what the commitments are. That way the fi the surpluses left behind would be less, but the person transferring and we're going to see more and more of this today er takes a fair amount of money with him. But of course if salaries go up evenly throughout a forty year lifespan and the Chairman is given a forty year lifespan which is quite or pension lifespan which is quite a suitable one, if salaries go up and someone leaves their company every ten years, then the first three departures are obviously going to be at much lower salary levels and it's not going to be satisfactory the first three departures are just index linked to inflation, there is the problem of how does one index link them towards the final salary. Otherwise that person having worked for four different employers during the forty years will not retire on two-thirds of final salary, but will retire on two-thirds er only perhaps the last employer for the last ten years. It isn't a question Chairman but it's easy to ask as it seems,we you said a ten year, but what about a thirty service of deferred pension, that could be an entirely different situation, because that is inflation put under the Post Office and B T ones it's inflation proofed every year, so for the ten years, if he's if he's got another ten years before he draws his pension at sixty, he would have that er deferred pension inflation proofed every year. So a thirty year old service might be entirely different than a person with ten years service deferring his pension. Yes, the reason why we picked a forty year lifespan of work or working life er with four tens was because Professor Good himself told us that er on their research the common employment pattern today is in fact four employers over the working life and of course that is very different from the experience of many pensioners who are drawing today from their pension funds, because many of them were long-term, long-service employees throughout their lives with one employer. But you were saying weren't you you described this world which lots of us now have lost and somebody leaving school starting a job and retiring from that job, so the que the question David's asked you is more important isn't it because deferred pensions are probably gonna become more, not less common. They are becoming a lot more common, yes when you look in the report and accounts there are far, far more of these deferred pensioners there than er than ever used to exist and it's something which I must admit we haven't given a lot of thought to yet, but it's something because it's growing that we will have to address erm in our federation, we will have to address that problem. And the danger presumably is that the surpluses we were having our discussion and debate about earlier on, those surpluses that and I do understand why you feel the pensioners should benefit from their surplus, but it the reality is that the employers and possibly the pensioners are currently arguing amongst themselves for the benefit of those surpluses, but in fact one of the significant contributors is often the deferred pensioners Yes. and the deferred pensioners are not actually getting in on the debate, they're not often represented on the trustees in fact. No, they're n they're not represented, erm but I think we would b you know, I mean I think they, they should get be considered certainly erm dependent upon the length of service which they have put in it's certainly something for the future. I was gonna make a point about the one you raised the practicalities of the situation. I don't know enough actuarial work to be able to and what settlements they should receive, but our own experience is that it's hard enough to round up pensioners to form an association and we embody deferred pensioners and they're even harder. We just don't seem to be able to track them down or attract them in quite the same way, so there is a massive practical problem if you want them to have a voice in how things are done, there's no doubt about that. We have that same problem, but er it can be solved quite easily, the employer knows the addresses of pensioners, there's nothing to stop pensioner association being formed. We are go smack across the thing! Right. But if you have it set to to amps Amps. then you'd probably get, well whatever the battery's capable of . But the first time he's hitting it See what I mean? it bloody hard ! So you've gotta be a bit careful! Well why on earth would a school have an And amp meter for? all these buttons like the normal I mean, I understand why a volt me , you know, I mean, but I mean, battery's have ? has a voltage written on . anyway! I mean, so what do you want a Yeah. volt meter for? Well when they I'm going to look at being funny. Yeah. Oh I'll be out in a minute. Erm if you the thing is,yo a battery might be marked nine volts Right. but when it's dead, it might only have six on it, six volts. Left? Well if it's dead, it's dead isn't it? Yeah, well it's dead yeah but what happens is, when it dies the volts go down, that's why the the yo your radio or whatever got it's operating and stops working. Know what I mean? So if it, if it's got six volts left, it wouldn't be dead would it? It would just be Yeah, it'd be dead. Would it? Yeah. Right. So what's the point of having a volt meter then? Just to find out what voltage you got left in your battery? Well no, your volt me , I use volt meters all the time at work. You make, build a circuit if you Right wanna test the power supplies you put a volt meter across to measure cos if you think So the power is going round? No, that's Well they an amp meter! You just wanna measure the volt, it's just a test meter isn't it? I mean, you get meters normally, the meters we've got at work and you just turn a knob and it's got ohms, volts, amps frequency you know, whatever. And they get them on one machine? Yeah. I mean, you can use a volt meter as an amp meter if you put a shunt across it. Right. See what I mean. Oh well at least I know that there is a, a different thing. It's all, it's all to do with ohms law, if you know ohms law then you'll understand I don't know ohms law. what's what. No. I mean I think really new, newfangled things! It's really not this . Oh it came yesterday did it? Oh she's sitting in it already. I don't know, he's got the key but he's not gonna get in. Oh. Yeah. I'll have a quick shake, shufty. It's very nice. Well the si , the back door's open innit? Oh is it? Yeah, so you can close it. Station please! Cor this is nice innit? First time Underneath I've been in one of these. underneath there that's your miles per gallon so as you're driving along Yeah. that tells you you know, how how you're driving it and onto Oh right! economy Yeah, yeah, got you! er been quite good in that one. Ha, so when you put your foot down the meter goes smack ! That's right. Yeah. There's your lights. Side lights. And what's, is this beam? No, that's er the rear fog light Oh right! and those are you know The beam would be on a stick wouldn't it? Yeah. It's on one of the sticks. Yeah. Yeah erm Oh it's nice isn't it? Electric windows if we go out later. Oh, sun roof as well. Oh yeah You can er adjust the lights, say that Mark's got in the back Yeah. put that on one Oh right, why? cos there's somebody in the back and that's Oh right, cos of, that changes the angle of the lights. Oh right. It changes the two Yeah, mm mm. erm and then you can control the density of the other lights. And they go down at a bit at a time or it'll go all the way down . Mm! Nifty, what? This is your mhm! Oh my god! like that. Is that for the mirrors? Yeah. Oh god! That's Do you wanna drive? Take it for a little drive. No, probably an ! I mean no, I wouldn't ! I'd take any other cars! No I wouldn't ! In any other car, I'd say it was no. Well you took your dad out didn't you? I know, but bit different. Honestly! The steering lock on? If you were to come back there Oh! all the wa , all the way starting up car We'd better get her out of here, she'll want one tomorrow! No, I wouldn't want . How long have you been waiting for this car, a while haven't you Spen? Erm Got a huge accelerator pedal innit? Just like it covers the whole of January. your foot! January we bought January, February, March, mm, that's not bad actually. So incredibly quiet! A lovely sound isn't it? Erm Mm , too right! How many valves has it got? Got sixteen valves has it? Yeah, no , twenty six. Four cylinders four Oh. . Even even with ashtray Yeah. Ah ! Ah no ! Oh that's sickly isn't it? That is really smart innit? Ah that's brilliant! How does that work then? They probably have a big No idea. whole department working on these ashtrays and then Yeah, I would of thought eighteen German engineers just Yeah. on working the ashtray . That fascinates me! Oh that's brilliant that ! No I like the light because like, as soon as as soon as you put your key in the door Yeah. the light comes on, and then it waits until you start the engine until it goes off Yeah. and then when you get out as soon as, as soon as the car comes to rest the light comes on Yeah. and then it stays on until you've closed the door and locked it, you know Yeah. then it goes out. No, there's all sorts of remote to adjust yo you think you're gonna set the clock so you have a little knob Yeah. don't you? But you don't, you've got a button to erm and you just put that . Oh god! I'm surprised it hasn't got a digital one actually. No. I don't like digital clocks No. I'd rather have it like that. For actually glancing down and looking at a clock It's nice. a Mm. dial one is is actually easier to read isn't it? Well What's sa what's the hi-fi like then? Mark . Not bad really. Just do one more when we've listened to it. The radio's pretty good. And the aerial is in is those two strips on the window. Oh yeah, yeah. Rather than an aerial. Vandal-proof job Yeah. you see. Good for vandals, yeah. There is is like a break, this vandal-proof thing, if you park in a duff area Yeah. You pull them thing out do you. Yeah. You can Oh yeah, take it Take your out. radio out and and lock it in the glove box. And they give you you get four keys and one of them is called the chauffeur's key Yeah. and that will drive the car but it won't unlock the glove box or the boot Yeah, for the chauffeur. so if you do , you don't want your chauffeur to know what you've got in the glove box A chauffeur key ! That's your job then Sue! I like these seatbelts at the back! They come from the other way Yeah, it's amazing! don't they? They go the other way to normal. Yeah. That's good actually. They say that's so that if there's an accident They can just get out innit? then people can er get you out easier. Oh course Yeah. yeah! Never thought of that. A lot of design's gone into that. Good old Gerries ah? Yeah. But it's not Yeah but this one did as well. Yeah. These floor mats see they've got little screw in things. Oh, what's the idea? Just twist the lock and they Mm! It's a bizarre amount of detail but It's got a lovely , lovely gear box hasn't it? Mm. Gear stick on that. Yeah. Nice little chunky one. Yeah, it's very nice! The Germans have certainly got it haven't they? But i , Mark you look at this accelerator pedal it's the whole sort of length of your foot, it's Mm. so comfortable instead of Mm. that piddling bit that goes in the ball of your foot. And you find you see you've got that little thing to put your clutch foot on as well. That, next to you. Is there? Oh No. god! No, go to the left. Oh I see what you mean. And there's a little Yeah, yeah a little they've even put that. They're so Yeah, well it's all for comfort I think. Yeah. They're amazing aren't they? How fast will it go then Spence, I'm sure you wound it up? No, you mustn't take it over They've tested it at a hundred and thirty five miles done, eh? You ge yo you mustn't take it over er, three and a half things or eighty miles an hour Mm. for the first six hundred miles. Mm. But the top Oh course, yeah! speed in the book is a hundred and twenty nine. Oh cos you only got it yesterday didn't you? Yeah. Mm. Mm. I don't think we'll get anywhere near a hundred and twenty nine in that ! It's not that so much though, it's just a luxury and the the quietness of the engine and everything Mm. isn't it? Mm. And Er acceleration I suppose. Yeah, it's very good it's very good like between forty to seventy, you know, for actual Mm. pulling away from lights or whatever it's not, nothing very special. The thing is when you're doing No, but I mean but when you're doing fifty and you wanna overtake something Yeah. Yeah. That's when it's very tight. It's very nice! Let's go and see my sis! Yeah, very impressive isn't it? Got a nice sound to it as well, when you're when you're not speaking. Mm. Little But it only works the horns. with the erm the ignition does it? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah we haven't tried the horn yet. Probably goes diddle di der der da diddle der der ! Ooh! Well you wouldn't argue with that would you ? Splendid, yeah! Oh yes , very nice! Very nice Spencer! Nice interior, grey, I like grey. I'm surprised you couldn't Yeah I actually and the door opens for you. Yeah, that's a bit of a let down isn't it? You've gotta ha work that handle, yes. It is really, you've gotta open the door ! Want someone to lift you out as well do you Sue? Well you know. Nice big chunky doors on it. Yes it's very good! Lovely colour! You choose the colour did you? Well I had Cor! like a blanket with bright red dark red or erm or white. It's sort of a is it a sort of bluey green? Or is it a racing green? It's called nau nautic green. Or I mean the reds and greens are a bit boring aren't they? It's Mm. different. Even though it's just a car . What the hell is that The smell? I dunno, it stinks! Phworr, Jesus! Phworr! You're meant to have a a beige upholstery with it but I think the grey would be Yeah. nice. Oh, better. Yeah, I don't really like the . Yeah very nice! If only we could. I like the cigarette bit! Don't even smoke but she likes the cigarette bit ! Ashtray! Don't smoke do we darling? Well no,. Where's your car? Oh it's just up the road. It's just, I I you know, we were there and we'd sort of gone past so rather than reverse Well no, I I just carried on cos I saw a space there, that's all. Ooh! So how come you got a filthy cold then?

I mean the there's no parking at the B and B Yeah. There's no parking at the hospital, it's terrible! And er you know, it just wasn't worth it. , I should think it's good for him! Put on a bit of weight haven't you? This looks Yeah. wonderful! Mm. I thought you were supposed to go round those, not Have you seen the new Star Trek yet then?

Do you still watch Is it still the old crowd? Do you watch Star Trek now? Shi , William Shatner? Mm. Really? Is it really? Good god, he must Don't like it now though without the likes of William Shatner and that. Is that the new one? Yeah. Well you'll like th th this, it's very, very well done! Extremely Oh! well done! It's sort of it's like erm analogy between what's happened in Russia and all that sort of thing cos they couldn't . Ah! Oh right! It is very good! Have to go and see that then girl! Mm. Yeah, could go next weekend if you want? Or Friday? Well we'll be going to see J F K sometime this week won't we? Mm. I wouldn't mind seeing that either actually. I thought William Shatner had been had to be resumed or something. Right. Yeah, the well honestly the toupees are endless! It must of taken them years to get them made up to look even vaguely Has it got Scotty and that lot in it? Yeah. I mean Scotty's seventy six or older than Bones is seventy one. Yeah. Yeah Bones has really aged ain't he? All these old Er, and Scotty's just you know, he's Is, is erm What about Scott? Scott's in it, yeah. Is Leonard in it then? Yeah, they're all in it. Are they? They're all in it. Good lord! Zulu's got his own ship now. Checkoff's in it, and , they're all in it. Oh Zulu still looks young doesn't he? He's probably about sixty ! Yeah. He's looks far better, I think he is a younger . Checkoff's got a toupee. You can Yeah? see it. You know, it moves without his head sort of thing, it moves away! It really is, I mean you'd die laughing! This has gotta be the last one though hasn't it? They say it is. Yeah. Well there's loads of pensioner's jokes in some of these , it was really, very good you know, when Is he still admiral? No, he's the captain. No, yeah, he's the captain of er see he got, he got demoted didn't he? For Yeah. Cos he went out of Scott's . For going into the Ah he got, ah he got done for that did he? And suspiciously Yeah, he didn't wanna be an admiral anyway did he? No! No, it was very good! All about the Klingon Empire diminishing and what can they do about it? Oh hello mate! Yep! I can't pick him up! I think he's still not made out whose home he's in! Yes, yes, you're alright aren't you? We love you! They're very nice cats are. They move when you stroke them They'd do that all night. and dogs don't do they ? As they indeed! Mm. We've been trying to . Crawl in right by the fire can't you? And he's such a hooligan, you know,he's knackered one of his claws again! Daft thing about it, but I thought rather than hang on I'll get in there and get off. Oh! another anaesthetic to cut it back! He's terrible! Hello! then? Yeah! Oh yeah, could do, if we try it . You can just imagine, pull them out! No! Oh no! Well really when I had the same thing , you know,and goes back for a little bit this morning and er same sort of thing. But, you know, it's just when you think oh my god, that's money! I mean, how much do they cost those pills? Cor! Nineteen and a half pounds, I thought they were more than that actually. God! but you know, I mean I know it's not . Mm, it's very nice though,. The mats had were under six pounds this morning, and I pay only half of that. Oh you had to buy the mats do you? Will the company buy them? No. Oh. Well it was seventy six pounds before VAT. Yeah, but you say that I paid thirty pounds for the Astra, now let's get it in the balance here, you see what I mean, and that sen and then Mm. they've, they're you know, quality-wise they're double the quality. Yeah. Plus they're the German ones and you can say Plus more. I can Mm. that that But you'll don't you with it? What? With the car? Oh yes. But it was that or a Vauxhall . Oh no! Oh god! It's not quite the same thing Go for B M W every time! the sports . Ah, yeah, but the B M W I'm afraid is, they've got it haven't they? Oh yeah I I think so too. I think B M W's are the business really! We were Oh you didn't did he? Well not cos we haven't quite got one, a B M W . No, but a a big four wheel drive thing, you know it's quite sort of. Oh, what that one? , yeah. Yeah But you like them! Oh wha what one is it? He'll be at you, why didn't you get one of them? No,wha what's it called? You know, you wanted to drive one. No. Oh that, what that little jeepy thing? Oh I know, not them! Oh aye, you should have one of those! Yeah we saw that in the Radio Times. Yeah, you liked that didn't you? Yeah. They're not that expensive actually are they? They're cheaper than one of those. Oh yeah! Those, you know, the the really should of got one, you know it's , almost a Range Rover. Mm. Fo four door but there's some problem because it's their . Very . Mm. I just thought it was a bit chunky. the car. Oh I would of gone The BM I would of gone for the four wheel I do , yeah but definitely! I know I wouldn't, I think they've been . Mm. Yeah but trouble is you pray for ra , pray for snow when you've got a four wheel drive car! God Yeah. snow, look! Don't really want it. Yeah. So mum and dad are alright are they? Yes, they're fine! Have they drove the car? Yes. I it's nice you know I haven't been no, I dro , I drove that and it's really quite nice but I might I wish he hadn't of got it cos Sue wants it when he's finished with it. Oh. Do you? Seriously, yeah. It's a nice Well have it! sort of, it's a nice little car to drive actually. It's got the Renault, the Fuego gearbox, you know. Mm,. It's, it is really nippy for a one point four! Mm. Erm, and it's, it's all there, it's, you know it's a nice car, it's the nicest car he's had! Yeah. And it you know, good round the cor , really nice little thing to drive, yeah. Even though It would be nice if it . Oh god yeah! Oh, you know, he's . Really ni , I mean you get in there and you feel really comfortable and everything's there you got a nice radio as well and er but yeah, it's really very nice! Much nicer gearbox. It's a typical sort of Renault floppy gearbox, you know what I mean? No. Sort of play about with it and , instead of all boring Yeah. I don't like floppy gearboxes. Oh! I like a nice a positive ! I like that Fuego gearbox. Mm. The same sort of thing as the like this could go through that. Mm! Yep! Straight on! Yeah I know , I said I want one . Mm. Is he gonna go . He's now done a hundred and seven thousand, I think, a hundred and eight thousand. Just about in the ground now innit really? He won't let you . It sounds like a diesel engine so . Yeah but it's erm Didn't he? I didn't think , it's not that old. I've only noticed it five years, it looks filthy, although it's been in the car wash . Hasn't it? Yeah, it's all the on the roads innit? Yeah. But you want a Sierra . No I don't! You wanted the Sierra! You want the four wheel drive but it's not practical! Oh! So that's gone! Mm. Ho how far have you gotta go over before you you get a you'll get a company car at B T? Er head a group or group leader quite a way. Most of those have got P H D's. It's er it's a bit strange at B T! And then you only get a popular ghia, it's hardly worth it! No you don't! Don't you? Or do you? Actually, don't forget Yeah, you a Sierra, yeah. yeah. no, then you've gotta your car. Who? No No. so th th yeah, but . Mm. But,th he is you know, he is very, very good about it, he would know from loads of money and he's and his company could have a one point six Sierra Mm. you know Yeah. you don't think No. but er I think that they were part of your pay rise one year was it? Yeah,th they had a new, a re-think. grading, instead of giving them a pay rise they get That's right. And I mean er, you know car. if yo if you're earning that sort of salary, I'm afraid to say, which you know, the header groups are Mm. I mean, to drive round in a one point six basic Sierra, well it's pathetic It's pathetic isn't it? really! Mm. Mm. Mm. I mean I just think Well, well Mike didn't have one cos he was too tall! Mm. And he kept banging his head on the ceiling! Yeah, I know, it's tall ! So he didn't have one and ma and my group leader he er he's already got about nine cars cos he collects them anyway ! He said, what do I want another bloody car for! So Yeah. he didn't have one either. They get a good deal really don't they? Well we'll be going to an auction to get like a reasonable car. Yeah. Yeah, I'll enjoy that. We shall get, you know, sort of, an E or and F and They must, they must be going for rock bottom prices at the moment there! I saw an E Sierra in the paper for about three thousand that had only done forty thousand er, an estate. Mm. Wasn't a very good, one point eight. But you can save a lot going to the auction can't you? Bit of gamble a though! Well as long as you don't mind the high mileage cars but if they've been going up and down the motorway all the time Not all of them are the high mileage though are they? . Yeah, a fleet car. But never mind! Well Mike went to a we went to the auction at Yeah. to buy and had very much in the sports car range. No , they don't, they tend Mm. to be your typical company Company car Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But they shift So them so quickly don't they? Mm. You don't get time to think about it. Mm. It's like in But then if you, I mean when we went there was that, I mean, okay it was erm it was a van wasn't it? But it was a Vauxhall Astra van but I mean it was E reg and it was three years ago and it went for two thousand quid! You know, and it's got That was in mint condition wasn't it? It was an F, F reg was it? a van. No, it was an E reg. Was it E? But, if you were buying it at a garage you were probably gonna pay at least four Mm. four and a half. Mm. And it was a bargain! Yeah. There wasn't a mark on it, but I mean Yeah. Well that's cos it was a van you see. That's right. But I mean Well no, but I mean even so, the the Sierras your gonna get cheaper there. Well a van for us would be ideal wouldn't it? I don't want a van! Well you don't need to have back seats do you? Especially if there's just two of us. We could dump the dogs in the back and off you go! You want a Sierra estate mate if you want to go knocking about the Lake District with the dogs. Well it wouldn't matter what you what you'd got the ozone, yeah. you always want something better don't you? I mean we went u up to Hunters this morning to get those mats Mm. and there was a a a five Yeah. five, grade five N in er sort of gun metal grey, I mean, it's all grey Oh yeah, yeah. leather seats and er Yeah. and you looked she looked at me and said , But it said . Thirty nine Yeah. nine fifty? Yeah. You you always want something better . Actually didn't he? Who? Nick. Is it? You know Nick ? Yeah, I know Nick. Does he work he work at Hunters on their Mm. ? Mm. Hello! What do you want then? Well we better get, go before they start mate. Yeah, we'd better go to Sainsbury's, Great fun! I hope you feel better matey! Mhm. Ooh! Nice to see the kitchen's coming on at last. Yep. Mm. Hey? No. I reckon she's foxing! I don't do I? No, she just sounds a bit grot! You look very poorly! Any excuse to watch this box, eh? Just doesn't fancy decorating today,that's the No. No. Then you get a week off. Oh course it's, bugger it! It's half term isn't it? You tell her!

I didn't actually see I n I never saw the door. Oh you just hit it. I just heard a bang. What happened then? Well he ran into someone's motor and rode off. Whose fault was it? Oh, I reckon it was his. Do you? Why, what happened? Here we go again. The third picture he's drawn. Why don't you just do one ? No I've got I've got one here. Right. Parked was here, I was going up that way. That's me by the way. Yeah. He was parked, he'd sort of just pulled in there and left his car. He was over here somewhere . Door was open, headlights on. I came up, didn't see his door, went through the gap and wham, bam. You could argue that it was it was his right of way.. Why? He wasn't even in the car. Yeah I know but if you look I mean if there was no-one in the car and the door was bloody open then And the engine was running was it? Yeah well he shouldn't have he should never have left that engine running cos he wasn't Yeah I know. in there for starters, and he shouldn't have left the door open. Yes.. Shouldn't leave the engine running if you're not in the car. What you hit his door did you? Yeah. So I closed it for him. Oi mate you left your door open. Door open. Just imagine if he'd been sitting there with his legs dangling outside . So you didn't see the er the door open ? No I didn't s er s I didn't see his door open. Well I I would say it's his fault. Mm. It sounds a bit dodgy if you've got out the car, left all your lights and stuff on the bloody door open. Mm. In th in the middle of the road. Yeah. How long was he gone then? I dunno. What was he getting something out the boot or something? I dunno how long he was The boot was open yeah. His fault mate. He won't get away with that. Oh shut up Hello, sanctuary. He's seeking sanctuary Sanctuary. My son, what can I do for you? Nothing, just be here for me. We all love quality so much. He's come for confession. He's over there. Over there? Over there. What over in the other corner? So can I get ? You just want some extra money don't you? No, it does hurt. But it didn't hurt till this morning. Do much damage to yours? Er indicator smashed er pushed the headlight in a little bit wing was a little bit dented ? Write-off then. Yeah, it was last night. Yeah, write-off . A definite write-off. Not as far as the insurance company are concerned. Do you know if ? No. I'm waiting for Bedge. Oh . What what have you got your fucking neck? He's being a wazzock. Bloody right you are. A wazzock. No I listen to the radio sometimes on it. Pardon? Listen to the radio on it. Can't pick it up very well from here . Oh fuck. You are dead. No er John's . John. No no no it's alright. Right. I'll go I'll go and see John. Hang on, hang on. I've got to go and see him anyway. Oi Yes ? Yeah I think we're going to have to retract that to be honest. Get the right layer You might try and bring that one through there. No I've just had it's not normally a problem with us, but the manufacturer they're using,alright, is shit,and they'll tend to end up It's better to put loads of bends in rather than er Yeah. Well it is for them. Normally erm I wouldn't worry too much on the prototype, but this is probably gonna be the production So each bi er board isn't individually checked then for shorts? Yeah. It's not? It's not, no. Well, they should be, but this company are shite. Mm. And you can't move that. Well if we put er a kinky in here Yeah, alright. Yeah. Trying to see where this one goes that I wanna move It er it'd be handy actually if it generated an error when it did that. Yeah. Then you could just pinpoint them all Arguably it's not it's not really a problem is it? Not normally no. Mm. Mm. He's such a fast worker Been there before mate. I take it all back. Been there before. Yeah, don't believe what your mates tell you, I know. See that one could arguably Oops. I like these white D R Cs, they're er Er actually, er much as I hate to admit it, I think you could be right. Well they stand out,bang. As soon as something happens, woof you're there. Oh god, what a cockup. I've deleted No. It's best not to fuck around with these. I find I've found that if you if you get it like that just, you know delete it. No, the command Look. I mean, if you did get one that wasn't forty five and you didn't see it, it wouldn't be a problem for the manufacturer would it? I mean er does it just tell it Er to draw a line from one coordinate to another? Erm The pen? Does it tell it to draw a line from point to another Yeah. Well forty five's slightly yes. Yes, I think it does. Cos on here you get you get like quanti quantization steps don't you. If you don't Yeah. you get like a little ladder, Yeah. don't you, right? But you don't actually see that ladder. Nearly finished. Yeah, okay. Is it annoying you? No. Oh. Well this this curve here's got s steps in it but it won't Yeah. be like that. It l it looks curved. If you look on this one. Oh yeah. It's pretty smooth. No problem. No problem, sir. Oh, there's something wrong there. Yeah, it's not on grid. What's not on grid then? No, actually, you want eh, you try it. Alright, erase it. No, don't move it. It looks like that not on grid. No no no no. No. Delete it. Sorry? follow the trace, Yep. Had that before. It's weird innit? Yep. What else have we got? That's why it'd be so nice to be able to w save the work area so when Yeah. you go back in, That's right. you know your grid and everything's all set as it was. Especially on Monday mornings. I find that incredible that you can't do that. Oops. I just turned them on. Oh, dig it. That's a bit close as well isn't it? What that? No that's fine. It's alright is it? Mm. It's only if it goes in and you've got no angle Yeah. there yeah. outside yeah. Mhm. Look at that . Well it's gotta be fairly close to that pin. Probably doesn't make any difference. Then it'll be it'll be even with the other one then won't it? It's so different isn't it? Yeah but it's got erm Yeah but then you've gotta bend all those tracers haven't you? I've put it there so that it'll look neat. I don't see why not. God Bedge, you are a pedantic bastard. What's that? Yeah I know but John's anyway. Go to help. Hit the help and say page Don't you wanna see if you can put page numbers I don't think so. I couldn't find anything for I wouldn't have thought you'd wanted to, that was the thing. I know, but and temps like Lawrence and so on, that we don't lose that we can actually utilize. Do we know when Michelle might be available to join E W S? I asked erm Ian yesterday to try and give me the dates so I, I'm, I expect him to come back to me today with some idea on that. It should be before Tracey goes. And what about overtime on Sa I mean at the moment some of them are working during the week and Saturdays and they need that to maintain the sort of service level that we're doing at the moment. W well the only issue for you is whether or not you can, you're in good enough control there to be able to say can you we need to be within the four to six banding, okay? Erm I think I am at the moment aren't I? Yeah Mm. you're down un down as four according to the la the last one I got. So I could let it slip slightly? Well you, you can actually cut down some of the overtime maybe, and you need to review that and that's, you need to make that decision. I've put a lid on it anyway Yeah they're not allowed to do more than ten hours each. So I then, I don't stipulate whether that's during the week though or whether that's at the weekend because I, I agree with what's been said about they're, they're more productive during the weekend cos they don't get the interruptions Mm. Mm. so but I agree, I mean you could start trying to look at it and cost it Well they don't get the interruptions in the evenings, or shouldn't do. No, I think they're more tired and it's I think it tends, tends, things tend I think you're right, they're just from the day do tend to drag on don't they? Mm. Weekends they're fresh, they're more likely to Whereas on, on Saturdays it's easier for supervisors to say okay well this day we're gonna be doing This is wha , yeah arguments In which case there's more to be said for actually not, for doing less, less in, in the week During the week yeah. even at double time so we need to check that out. If that figure's justified though then I'll bat on that basis. Cos the important thing is is not so much the number of hours as the, the, the affecting on, the effect on the cost. So what happened about time and a half? Are we still going for that? Well I told my lot to whatever they do on a Saturday, put it down on Monday and that way it'll automatically get paid at time and a half. So yours are already only being paid time and a half? Well for this Saturday onwards, yeah. done that. Well I sort of gave them a choice, do they want to nominate who does overtime or do they want to have a cat or do they want to pay, get paid less and they said they'll get paid less. I gave them a choice. We all need to be consistent I think don't you? Mm Yeah. Yeah I think you need to check out those figures first, before you make a decision on it. Cos it might be that it's more productive. But the question that mi will be raised, depending on, is why aren't we that m that productive ordinarily? Is it just because there are no interruptions? Erm that's what we need to find out I suppose. I just got these, the quotes figures here we, first three months of the year we were budgeted for six hundred and eight hours overtime and we a actually did sixteen hundred. A thousand hours? A thousand hours er i i i hundred and sixty seven hundred and seventy percent increase. Any idea what cost that is? Well it's equivalent to an another two and a half people. But that's on overtime rates so, no I don't know I haven't, well I can probably work it roughly Two and a half that's about that should be about seven or eight thousand won't it? At least. Is that, there,tha that's, that's e so that's just the extra amount? Thousand hours extra, yeah Yeah. over three months. So so that's thr that's almost three times what you were expecting ? It's er yeah two and a half hundred and sixty percent higher than, than I would expect. Yeah. That's the, that's for every month? No Ju ju just That's over the three months. One quarter of the year. That's over the three months. Well it, the difference, I can tell you what the difference is ten grand. That's how, that's how much my budget is overspent er ov overtime is overspent. Right. So our variance is seventy three so take that out that's sixty three from our variance overall the rest of the patch is sixty three. But again we also need to work out how much has been spent on claims and E W S on on work which is er higher than budgets but we can say okay, that's not a direct result of deteriorating productivity, that's a direct result of, of problems we've got with temps and so on, that's a problem we've got with increased, increased work levels. So I need to be able to get down to actu that's when you, supposing that comes down by another ten K say, so then we're talking about fifty K, thereabouts, overspend in the main area, in which case to work out what's caused that, is that directly attributable to the the inputting of the systems. If it is then we should be able to say okay, as we come clear of the systems, we should actually be, that should be just a one off, special cause for that period. Anyway Maureen'll be trying to work out some, some of the, some of the issues so you expect that. How were things on Friday then? I mean did you see her after Friday's meeting? Yeah And were they were they that wildly out or? Well this is erm as I say we, we, we could've been somewhere in the region of two hundred and fifty thousand just on the I T issues alone. But it doesn't actually account for all of the overtime that we've spent not directly anyway. A part of that obviously I think is going to be that there was an expected higher level of productivity than we've actually achieved, cos you know in January I think in, in Christine's area for example, to start off with I mean er er er productivity plummeted erm and it's now, and she changed the system and, and one or two other things. And you've seen for example in central, Sheila, that their, their productivity level has improved Mm almost week by week. So what we actually are possibly seeing is ourselves coming out of the trough so therefore part of it's a training curve, but we do need to see that training curve start to come down and get back on to a level but we don't know where the level is, that's what worries us at this stage. And that's what we want to make sure we are in control of. Okay. It's important but I, I wouldn't I don't want to er get carried away with the fact that we're not performing well because we are performing well. Okay erm do you have any questions on that? No? No. Okay erm just move on to erm some items from the breakfast meeting this morning. Firstly, tomorrow you will see, I'm told, a man in a rai raincoat walking around the offices erm a guy called Mr maybe he's wearing a trilby as well with a tape measure. He'll be measuring things around the office. It's partly to do with the rent review. Erm the, the instructions I've got is be courteous but we're not here to answer questions. So if he asks you questions about the building or whatever then dunno Ignore him refer him refer him back to Office Services. Erm right, some other good news as well some good news coming out this morning, all these green shoots everywhere. Just give you some information on, on the fo sales forecast and sales r sales results erm on the sales forecasting front erm there's been a, a quite significant growth in head count in March, particularly. Erm most have, in fact most of which is er b er seventy four additional heads were put on in March, so we've gone from seventeen twenty three to seventeen ninety seven erm and Mick accounted for most of those with forty four. Erm and that means that we're thirty four heads up on budget at the end of March erm which is g very good news. Now one of the interesting things about this is that they've worked out, in order to erm achieve our sales forecast, erm the impact of recruitment for each branch is that we need a net growth in branch of one plus one for every er on every month. So each month they've gotta put, each branch have gotta put on plus nine between now and December and that should translate itself if the theory works erm to the figures that we want. And it's also not an unachievable figure, plus one a month net. Is that one over their existing forecast? Oh just one over their existing number? Yeah, take the current number, add one Oh so where you've got ten now, you end up with eleven at the end of the month, next Right month you end up with twelve and so on. Erm now Alton for example started off at the beginning of the year with four and they're now at thirty three very s very impressive how much they, them will succeed I don't know but some other good news on that front is that erm the average age of our consultants overall is now thirty one, whereas three years ago it was twe below twenty one. So Below twenty one the average? Yeah, the average age three over three years ago, it's now above thirty one. Thirty one-ish. The average age of our new recruits is now twenty nine. Sorry it's the other figure, the average age of our new recruits was under twenty one three years ago, right? The average age was about twenty three I think. So the average of the new recruits is twenty? Twenty nine. Just Go on. What's the total consultant count now? Seventeen ninety something? Seventeen Yeah it's just yeah it's almost eighteen hundred. Er which is a above budget. The other issue is that erm the production for March erm was a, was a gross brokerage of three point three mill and erm, which is plus six percent on the budgeted figure That's good. but I ought to explain what I mean by budgeted fi figure. That's the, that's, that's the planned figure, the forecast figure. Now one of the things you might've seen from the corporate briefings is you've got the budget figure and a forecast figure. The budget figure is what's been agreed with and it's a straightforward month by month, seasonally adjusted erm budget which comes to the end result figure that we're aiming for for this year. Erm the forecast figure is our plan of getting to the end result, which is not the same thing, which is in a way it's a bit like our overtime hours and some of the areas we said that we would spend X amount of hours in, in two months, we've had to then change the shape of that and said we'd have half of X over five months, so our forecast i is being done differently, cos they've worked out the, the branch forecast quite significantly differently erm Jeremy went through, through most of th briefly most of the means of doing that this morning and it sounds a lot more sensible than what they've done in the past. So when you see the forecast figures and, and, in, in the, the , that's what our plan is. If we hit our forecasts, even though it's below budget, we will actually hit our end of year targets. Erm it's g there now obviously the end of year it builds up over the end of the year partly because it relies on the extra recruitment and the increasing sales per er per capita erm or per capita sales I should say. Erm but it, it certainly is achievable. It isn't sort of oh well, just go for it, you know. It is certainly achievable and it has been done in er at varying levels by region and branch. And the worst branches have been given the, the, the stiffer targets to get them up to scratch. In other words the people who are performing well already will find it harder to make erm a significant inroad into that. So there's some good news there. Erm in March the top branch was erm Hugh erm interestingly enough erm in the south erm Nicholas erm was well down on recruitment, he was down minus twenty seven on his fore on his target, but was significantly up on his bus business that he brought in because they've been focusing on er in on that. But erm the conversations I've had yesterday indicate that they are doing a major push on recruitment. So er and they're very bullish I have to say, very bullish about the way things are going. So that's looking pretty good on that. I don't think I've got anything more from this morning so, only a bit about policy fees which I believe are now scheduled go up in first of August. There'll be an announcement about that and there's a team being put together to do the implementation. Are they gonna actually an announce it to erm the general public? Yes. Cos they were gonna just put it in generally speaking, you know Yeah but they're, but they're not they're gonna do it in some time in June I think that's the target. But I haven't got any more details of that yet. They're working on what they're gonna say and when they're gonna do it at the moment. Is that John ?sponsor Erm I think, well I think 's sponsoring it, erm with John . And Valerie and erm Roger will still be helping to put together the communication stuff. Do you know we're actually, on some cases we're actually stealing their thunder. Erm we've got some stand alone term insurances which are currently paying one pound ninety, so the moment they increase the policy fee they'll attempt to lapse so we're writing to all those people now to tell them to increase. What we telling them to increase to? That I've said erm if you take into account inflation at five percent which they, they, although they're not, haven't put it in concrete, they reckon they're gonna link it to inflation, erm that should be, in thirty years time, about five pounds. So I said erm if we say increase to five pounds now, they don't have to, but it means that they'll probably have a significant unit holding, you know, to compensate them. So five pounds will be absolutely safe but anything less than that won't be. But which, which type of policy is it? It's what? That I mean there, there won't actually be any impact on the system will there? It won't actually lapse them off but it'll, you know, give them a negative unit situation. Well th if it's only, if it's only term assurance there's no units involved anyway. No but the one pound, the O one record We'd never get our money would we? the O one record The O one will be going further into than the That's right. Yeah. Is that, presumably that's what's happening at the moment, it just goes one pound ninety in deficit each month Yeah. in the O one? And you see the problem with erm depending on the unit, the bid off the spread etcetera, sometimes they're paying us one pound ninety and it actually ends up in a nu mi minus unit situation Aha cos of the five percent bid off the spread. So And what happens in those cases then? On those cases it, it usually evens itself out er it usually says oh due to roundings I'll ignore that erm cos I've actu erm I've gained through the unit statement on, cos I've had one of these stand alone policies, and not wishing to pay the one pound ninety I've actually knocked it on the head now and incorporated it with another policy, but erm when we looked at it all, overall I've got a nil unit situation but in some months I actually had negative units, some months I had a, a sort of like point zero one of a unit positive. So there you go. Okay erm I've got, I just thought I'd, might just let you know that the, the end result figure that, that, on the recruitment front, they reckon they'll be at twenty three hundred by the end of the year. Good news. Okay, Jackie first of April recall problem. control contacted me yesterday to say that erm due to loss of system last week, and the fact that the Easter weekend erm is looming up on us, it means that they've, they've got insufficient time to run all the jobs that they needed to erm in the space that they, they would like to run them in. They gave me two options, basically one was to take the system down for twenty four hours and er while they got, they caught up with the jobs which I, I, I've knocked on the head. The other one was that they would be th the direct debit re-present on the first of April would be running one day late erm which, as a consequence, means that the recall re-presents would come back one day late. The recall re-presents come back in two phases erm one tape will come back on the fifteenth of April, the second tape will come back on the sixteenth of April which means that those policies, when status report runs on the fifteenth of April it will only assess those policies erm that have had yeah it'll, it'll assess them up until the fourteenth and fifteenth of April and it won't take into consideration there's been a recall after that date. So it won't, they won't get picked up for arrears processing. I think there's only about, well on average there's only between thirty and forty cases erm and which they are happy to identify for us erm so we can go in and update the diary or, or do whatever. Shouldn't Er but I don't believe it's worthwhile doing manual on the cases, they will get picked up in the next data support run which runs two weeks afterwards, that'll be erm beginning of May. So it will just mean that on those cases, on approximately forty, their arrears letter will be going out a couple of weeks late. When does the er status report run? Is it on the fifteenth? No it, I think it actually runs on the sixteenth but it only looks at premiums up to the fifteenth, think that's built into the, the, the parameters on it. That's okay, if the premium was due on the first even though, if, if we'd done the erm the recall before the status report runs it will show that as being in arrears? Yeah but if we'd then gone in to re-present Yeah it shows it as back in force and the, and the re-present will have gone But if that comes back on the sixteenth, is that, is that what you're saying, yeah? Yeah. It comes And if the status report runs after we run that recall tape No it's because it'll only look at the No it can't. It will only look at the premium status up to the fifteenth of the month, it won't take into consideration when so recall's gone through on the sixteenth of the month. That's why it used to say please ignore this letter if you've paid in the last few days. Mm. Mm. I didn't think that was the way it worked. Well Terry confirmed that to me yesterday cos I asked the question could we not just run it Later later and erm it doesn't T Terry ? Yeah. Would he know? Well he's checked It might be worth checking with, with erm Paul. I, I think this business of up to the fourteenth is premiums due up to the fourteenth. If you don't run the status report until the twentieth and you make, you, you do reversals between the fifteenth and the twentieth the status report will take those into account if they're affecting premiums that were due before the fifteenth. Oh, okay I'll check that with Jim would know. I don't know if Paul knows. Paul . Or Paul, yeah. Jim did a lot of work in the programming of it. Okay, I'll let you know. Either way it seems like we, even if it is a problem it's Paul anyway, yeah. Okay. data integrity. Right. The team our team started erm this week and they're now in the process of writing procedures and er putting the training package together. They're also looking at some of the data integrity erm issues one of which is potentially quite a major problem and the new system will for any qualifying plans, once the new system is in, if a policy's in arrears it will try and collect the arrears and it will collect up to a maximum of two premiums each month until the policy's in force and up to date. A lot of erm group one plans are, there are about ten thousand plans that are showing an arrears status at the moment, and premium has been missed some time ago, it's not a, not a current premium, which means on the fifteenth of June or the first of July we will automatically go in and pick up two premiums, we'll t we'll try and collect the arrears without having notified the client of it in any way at all. So we're l , we're l , we're looking at a couple of the options to see, you know, how much will it cost to actually put the money on the policy rather than going to the effort of writing it out, and it's gonna cost about two hundred thousand pounds just to do that, erm and that, we need, we need to weigh that up with the cost of actually dealing with ten thousand letters to clients, ten thousand enquiries erm I just wondered what your thoughts were on how we should proceed. the overtime budget So we, we will have actually written to them won't we? A long time ago, yeah. At some time ago to say you're in arrears Mm. and never written again. Mm. This is on the conversion is it? Going from ? Yes, that first month. Mm. Yeah. These are the ones where we've pulled, the capsule ones? Same sort of scenario but there's a lot more of them on this is it? Well the capsule was always worked in the same, in the way No the capsule, yeah, it was always collected Yeah, always collected No er sorry that you're always sending them duplicate letters aren't you? Are they not gonna get any letters at all? No. No. No no no You're just gonna go in and collect the money. We're just gonna go in and collect the money without having told the client. You couldn't credit the money and then take it off later? No sense in that. it's an ongoing thing. Th th those plans are designed such that all the premiums have to be paid. Mm. Can't we trigger another arrears letter? Just before we go in? Well if we know what the policies are Mm which we do, we can set a letter up on the system and we just On the system? Yeah the stand alone letter system, just get everybody to go in and request that letter. It'll be a very, could be a very vague letter just say you remember we wrote to you some time ago that your plan was in arrears, we've never had this money and we're now notifying you that we're gonna collect the arrears on your ne c payment. We won't be able to tell them what that amount is. We'll be able to tell them the date though won't we? Mm not necessarily. Not, not on the stand alone system? No. It will be one of two days. It'll be one of two days, it'll be the fifteenth of June or the first of July. It's ten thousand you're talking about? Mm. But they could be in arrears by more than one payment couldn't they? Yeah. So you could not just be talking about the first premium. Well m most Ah most of them will be in, in arrears by one premium if they're two they should be lapped shouldn't they? Yeah. Yeah and we can er, they're actually discounted those ones so yes they are one Good. one in arrears, mm. I don't think I've got an answer No use looking at me I haven't got any answers for it er Well you're answer must be twenty two hundred thousand about a thousand. No it won't won't be. Yeah and that's the other issue, they've gotta be done, whatever we do it's gotta be done quickly now we're talking about implementation just two months away. Does the erm does the report show the date that they, they pay their premiums? No. D d yes it does show the date, it doesn't you dates missed. It does show the date, month. First I is it possible to identify these cases? Yeah we have identified them. Then isn't it possible for us to take a download of those cases, names an and addresses, and do a one-off special letter, as Bob suggests? And start doing that now. And just say that in, in, in July, during July, this will be collected in July. Don't know. You're giving them three months then aren't you? Yes It'll cost us won't it? I mean it's a further development. Yeah if we could download it on to a P C a P C and get the people downstairs to do it it would be about ten grand all in. Which people? Erm the, not sure, the computer Information centre you talking about? yeah the information centre. We've got, we've gotta pay, we've gotta pay to draw the, the, the lists off ini initially Well we've gotta do that anyway. We've got that and once you've got that on a disk then to do the download. Yeah, get it downloaded on disk and then put it on a P C downstairs. I don't want spending all the money on Why can't we could, as I suggest it would be slightly vague and, and the fact that the, the report shows the collection date, we could say the date it's going to be collected cos you'd get them to go through all Yeah and do all the fifteenth first Mm. and then we change the letter on the stand alone system and do all the firsts. Yes, yeah we could do that. But you just won't say the amount that's all. Erm the arrears letter at the moment don't give an amount. They w o on the arrears letter we write and we say you're in arrears, please send us a cheque for the usual amount. Which c which type of policy you talking about? All group one policies, so it's benefits on pensions plus all the erm qualifying policies on pensions Pensions would have, yeah. would be slightly different because they, we'd only be collecting a part of the premium we wouldn't be collecting their investment part if that's in arrears. I think we have to do a note, a letter, of some sort. Yeah. If there, if there was a So you are in arrears, we've told you before Mm we're gonna, just letting you know we're gonna try and we're, we'll attempt to collect this Presumably if they wanna know how much they ring up anyway don't they? Yeah. Yeah we don't want ten thousand enquiries Well this is the th No well we can phase it though couldn't we? They're, are they all gonna be the same, same date? Yeah, all gonna be on the fifteenth Well some will be the fifteenth of June, some will be the first of July. No I mean the, the arrears aren't at the same date are they? No. No. How's the report been produced? Just policy number order? Erm Team. team order I believe, yeah. So each team knows their own cases. Does the report tell you how much against each policy? Mm Oh it says how much they're in arrears? Mm. Do we know wh when it was from? We don't I suppose When the arrears is from no. We've done a comparison between those that were in arrears before the beginning of ninety two and ones that have been in arrears after ninety two, and it's erm approximately eighty percent before ninety two erm twenty percent after. Before nineteen ninety two? It's a long time isn't it? Mm yeah. So it's nineteen ninety one arrears? And before. And a lot of them are before that. Can't we just do a premium holiday on them? Not on You can't have a premium holiday on a qualifying plan. These are all qualifying are they? Mm. So you're gonna have enquiries, aren't we, about Why how d you know yeah, you're telling me now that I missed something in eighty seven. No we will have already told them then. And that'll be in the diary won't it? Yeah taken you two years to collect it. Mm. Well it could be more than that, it could be eighty Well eighty four, eighty five. Yeah over six years innit? Well is there like financial correction? Didn't we do it on ano on another situation where we're basically saying it's a system problem more than a plan problem. Are you talking about the, the winding forward of bill two pay two? Worth a try. So we just write it up but we don't actually Well all we Yeah money paid does it? I know, yeah. It's just a correcting Yeah system But it works it works by money doesn't it? Yeah. It doesn't work by winding anything on, No the, the amount due has to equal the amount paid the system can't otherwise the system can't cope with it. Can't we do a manual ? Mm. No, the only manual would No I mean, that's right, a computer I mean Yeah. Yeah do a things. We can't do ten thousand D F Us, no, no way it's Why what a er what about doing taking it out of er I mean the only way is taking out Mm. but putting a note on the diary that when that policy comes to erm Mature No you've still gotta to mature thousand pounds you pay the money back in to . You take that money Yeah it's like a loan isn't it? Yeah that is a debt against the policy but it would be so hard to administer Yeah, oh we won't keep that up will we? I mean we'll end up sending out Fifteen diary screens later you know telling what the value is and Yeah yeah yeah I, I mean if, we know how much is outstanding on each one, we know when it's due to be paid, we know it's gonna be about eight hundred policies a section, is it, ten thousand? Ten thousand. I think we ought to bite the bullet and write to them now and say if you don't pay us a cheque for this amount cos it's qualifying we'll collect on next date. And we'll just Yeah we're giving them three months notice, if we can do that quickly And each team'll have to do a hundred Well each team, that means we're gonna, we've got overtime then for It's a hundred a week they'll have to do, per team. No wh what I'm saying is why can't we produce the letters off the box let's, can we find out exactly what it would, what, how er if we can find a way of getting this information downloaded onto a disk and then run it off on a straightforward standard letter basis. Yeah it's gonna be the overtime won't it? Mm. How do I find that out then? Erm well the first person to ask probably would be Paul , if he'd download it onto a tape, how difficult would that be and he'll give you And he'll be going ee! kick him in the goolies, I mean Scrub that bit Erm Louise did a similar thing for me, managed to get some one-off letters run off the system. Erm Maxine was involved and they didn't get involved. Louise first. Okay. I we could still use the stand alone system which I think'll be the quickest. Use the stand alone system so it gets the date that we're going to collect it, it can say all the things that we've said, it's, you know, we wrote to you some time ago and, and er we, we didn't get the money if you don't, as you said, if you don't send us this money we're gonna sounds like a threat doesn't it, if you don't send this money within the next three months we'll automatically collect it together with your regular premium due on the date To ensure the qualifying status is maintained yeah Mm And then we can say the actual amount that we're gonna collect is and just hand write it. Could do. Leave a space and they just hand write it straight off the report. Doesn't look very professional but I suppose it's better than not telling them Well it's better than spending a lot of money but it's an option. Get them pre-printed Mm rather than typed. You've got all the name and address then No cos it pulls up the name and address. If you do it through the system Yeah Oh right yeah through, through the system, but what that can't do is to pull off the arrears amount. But you, you've got them on the report, we could just write the arrears amount Yeah, I think you're right that's, that's That sounds like a reasonable idea. And they are our longer lasting customers so I don't think we're gonna get up their noses too much. So I don't need to speak to Paul then? We just need to get a letter set up on the stand alone system. Well on that way, yeah. Two letters, one for the first one for the fifteenth. Mm. Well let's try and go for that then. And you've got the amounts on the report anyway. check check it out that it will, we think it'll work but Now whose name shall these go, letters go in ? I, I, I, I should say they need to go off no they need, they need to go off, off, off team Mm. because if anybody's got a query, well like well when was it paid somebody's gonna have to look up and scroll back and Yeah mm. In that case we need a space for them to write their team number on. Why not just put it in the reference? But isn't that the sort of thing ? No you can't, you, you only have, you can only hand write . If you do that through the cheapest method which is the stand alone system it won't pull that off. No that's what I mean, hand write it Hand write, yeah, and the team telephone number. If you've got any queries You don't want enquiry desk number? No I don't think so, you need to spread the load. If you've got any queries on this please call me on and they write in blah blah and they sign their name so that it's legible. Isn't the enquiry desk capable of looking out when that arrears Well th they're al they're already snowed under with calls, if you've got another ten thousand cases and, and e the teams will have all the information, they'll have the reports you see. I don't think the arrears, when they, when it occurred is on the report The arrears isn't, no, they'd, you'd have to go in and No no not when it occurred but what it is and when it's gonna be collected is. Well let we'll draft a letter up and see s s s Okay yeah. but we need to get that out probably during April. Yeah. Okay. Anything else on that then? No. Erm on the stuff we've already talked about, sickness, erm er and Michelle, the transfers from S I S, one of the issues from the budget was that erm B S G B S G? Mm. Yeah Yeah is currently running about six vacancies light. Now it may well be that some people will transfer from S I S into B S G, I don't know yet, erm Where've they managed to get all these vacancies from? Yeah! Cos they're supposed to have, their budget's for twenty and they've only got fourteen. The other issue They've budgeted for er twelve senior managers Well one or two have left of course. Erm Is that a new budget then? Or is that from last year? No it's from the, it's from the other old budget, I mean it's the cos it's b all been rejigged but the overall impact is that Ma Mark has got six vacancies. Now the debate we're having is whether or not we fill those and transfer, not go and recruit extra people but we'd reduce the S I S, cos one of the issues is that erm the overspend on Marvin is seven figures. What do you mean on Marvin? On ? Yeah. Potentially. Pu pulled Bob out of his coffee yesterday So one of the issues is if we don't do certainly er the timing, all of the issues that are on there that we'd like to do erm that means we've got less testing, if you're gonna do less testing then so it might be that they er re-utilize the resource that way. But I mean that's just what we're exploring at the moment. So it might well be that we don't get the S I S people that we previously thought we might do. In some ways that might be good news, some ways it isn't. Erm but again I don't suspect that there's gonna be any any impact on that for the, for at least two months. There wouldn't be too many of the S I S people that would be suitable would there? Well no, but then that hasn't stopped has it? If you see what I mean. So in some Right. ways I'm not unhappy. No no, oh no. erm if that does come about but it's, it's an issue. It's like the same issue we talked about the three year plan projects if necessary we'll have to slow down on some of the projects, certainly to get through this budget year intact. Obviously if business goes really swimmingly then it may be easier to , I'm not sure. Phil, units update, Right erm we have run two now er unit data correction runs and it looks like we're correcting about seventy six percent, on average, of the policy base erm the other twenty four percent being cases which are being sliced erm multiple events, you know, er and all the rest of it, all real horror stories. Erm it does mean that we've got, so far we've gone through twenty two thousand policies, we're still in December erm anniversary dates erm so there's twenty thousand waiting to be printed two thousand were printed last night and they're going straight out the door,today. Erm we did an initial pilot run of nine hundred and seven, er and we had them redirected here which was quite fortunate cos we did find some er previously unthought of errors, erm there were two categories, these are ones where, since the renewal date, they've had er a decrease erm sorry an increase which meant that erm we're now quoting on their benefit statement as at last renewal, they've got today's er premium which of course is wrong, so we've had those redirected in future, inside here. And there's also some cases where er the plans have actually partially lapsed since last renewal and in which case it's quoting the premium they're paying now which is a lot less than the premium they were paying at renewal. So who's gonna be doing those? Those are gonna be redirected in here erm as well but it turns out that erm those two types roughly equate to forty out of two thousand which is half a, half a percent? Yeah. It's So only for matter of a week, ten days by which time it'll be fixed. Yeah we So there's we just won't be sending statements out? Er no th th for anything that they run this week, they'll be redirected in in-house, so we should be getting er about forty of those statements in tomorrow and forty the next day. And then they'll be reproduced? And then what we'll have to do,th the unit statement's perfectly okay, the benefit statement all you've got to do is get the benefit statement retyped but with a different premium in at renewal date. So the teams have got to do that have they? Yeah. This problem is only because you're doing them retrospectively, if you were up to date you wouldn't have a problem at all would you? Yes no problem, no. I mean it'll, this But we can't wait until Ju July for, to be complete. So you'd rather go ahead and just make numbers involved. Yeah. Well cos, for the sake of ten days there er er er erm Martin was gonna fix the problem, erm within ten days but we don't wanna have to go back and reprint everything cos the unit statement's perfectly valid. Yeah. Most of the i issues on the ben for most benefit statements they're also valid, it's just for these small number of cases where they're, they're not. Erm and it's really a question of retype the, the benefit Is it set up on the system, word processing? No it's not yet. I've got the first batch came back this morning, so now I, I've actually got the examples I can do it, it's not, no problem. Erm we've got, because we decided er decided that er redirect the whole first batch in-house we've got nine hundred and odd statements You could of course not send the benefit statement. Well the letter says Mm. change the letter. So if you're gonna retype you might as well Yeah and it's nice on the benefit statement to at least they've got something to reconcile against the units so that you've paid a total of ten Yeah, yeah you're right, yeah I was How ma how many do you reckon there'll be? Yeah yeah I know, yeah . How many do you reckon there'll be? Forty a day. Forty a day. So it's not an awful hassle Forty over ten days? No forty over er er Er forty a day over ten days. it'll only be until I should think erm next Tuesday will be the last batch, cos we've got these bank holidays fortunately in the, in the way where I T still work but we don't and so they're gonna fix, they'll carry on fixing it over the weekend. Erm there's nine hundred statements coming back in today but the units team that you all kindly lent me, we're all gonna sort through those and stuff them in envelopes and get them out the door. Okay. So the other ones, the ones that need correcting, we've gotta do a procedure or something for the team? Yeah. How do you pick up the ones that need correcting? The, they did an easy-trieve which runs every, every time they do a run they, they run and before they do a run they do an easy-trieve er identify those cases and then there's a marker you can put on poll M to redirect, it doesn't change the address but it redirects the unit statement in-house. Ooh magic. Yeah. Super. I had to use it for one of Andy That's worth knowing isn't it, in case yeah one of Andy's cases this morning I had to do it where it had growth old cash on it, which it shouldn't have had so it was quite handy. Mm. And there you have it. So we're up and running now. Okay statement. Okay I suggest we take a five minute break before we go on and just talk about regionalization and get a coffee or whatever. Back here at five to? Mm on the faxes, just erm one item that came up really from yesterday which I've already passed on to, to Sheila from the south cos it was raised at the south meeting but I think it's relevant to everybody. When we're using the fax facility and we get a series of policy numbers and a problem coming through to us erm that's not so bad cos that's being amalgamated by the branch secretaries, when it's going back, and we do it on the same one single fax going back, they're sitting there snipping up individual replies, you know putting individual replies into consultants' baskets unless they photocopy the whole sheet in which case they've got a confidentiality problem. Do you think you could look into trying to, when we're going back on the information, sending an individual fax for each case? We had this with Malcolm didn't we? From before. I . Yeah and we talked about doing it by consultant, rather than by client Well by consultant, yeah. it was an idea. But some of the branches apparently just like pinned it up, been quite happy to pin up the returned fax and then each consultant just gone and read his own bit. Yeah I know but, but mm okay I mean rather than do all the photocopying or whatever. If you ha if you haven't had it rai if you haven't got a problem then fair enough but if you do get it raised as a problem, the confidentiality bit, then fair enough. But I told Malcolm yesterday that I thought that, that we operated on the basis that they trusted everybody. There's a cost implication there of doing a separate fax for each consultant. Yeah. And time. Cos on ours, we just return the same thing that they send That's right. What we get Yeah, yeah that's right. Well perhaps I'll just do it for Malcolm's patch. I'll speak to Tim, what did Tim think? I think it was they wanted a complete reply for each consultant file, or case file didn't they? Mm. Which Unlike Malcolm to complain though isn't it? Mm. Validly? No you're right. With a valid er Right, okay. Erm the other thing was that the people at senior level need to be reminded, if they do have a major problem erm that's David and Malcolm, erm where, if they've got a rather difficult case and it's urgent and they want a, they don't wanna have to put it on a, on a fax, they want, they need it there and then erm, and they don't like the telephone call facility, I said well, well that's primarily for consultants. Erm Sorry to interrupt you but there's nobody around at all and I've, yeah if I can just No and Sue's just gone off sick, yeah. leave that with Phil rather than keep running up and down Yeah sure. the stairs. Ta, ta. Erm Ian left that with me and I was to speak to Bob before Bob gave it to because it wasn't very good. Oh right. Wha what wasn't very good about it ? when you've checked it. Oh the value isn't very good? Well that's what I assume he meant. Yeah we know that, I've already told Bob that. Ah! It's even worse . Oh no! He's made seven and a half P? Thank you very much. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. Yep. Okay so where were we? Talking about the faxes weren't we? Erm the point I made to them, that everybody round that table, if they did have a problem that they thought was urgent, they should get on the phone to the, you know, Steve and Mm They do. Sheila. I mean they do do it. Yeah I know they do but I mean I I'm not gonna sit there calling Malcolm a I could have done but er What I don't like is that we went back didn't we, I don't know if you saw my thing to David where we report back on a fax, report every month Yeah. who is phoning. Nicholas wanted to know who uses the phone That's right. so we report back. David didn't like it because he was on there and so we went through saying that I have only the most important It's not an issue for everybody else round the table That's right. except for those two. Yeah. But it's just worth bearing in mind that erm, as long as the senior people are quite comfortable they can get through to, to us if they need to, that they're not bound by the normal fax routine or whatever. But they should know that anyway, or I made that point yesterday, so er th the point they quoted was that erm erm rang up the team and got told no you've gotta put it on a fax,find it hard to believe that that was if that was the manager on the phone but it's just important that the people on the team know who the senior managers are. Mm. That's all. So it's worth reiterating, making sure each member of the team knows who the senior people are and the branches they're s they're operating. And if necessary get the things typed up and pinned up, key senior personnel at the branches. Put a branch organizations chart up. Okay er Phil I'll need to see you about erm organizing the unit party. We haven't done unit regionalization by the way, you skipped that. You haven't done Oh I know that, I know but I'm Oh right. waiting until after Kevin 's been in and gone erm cos, cos it'll, I don't wanna stop half way through. Oh right. Erm What's he coming in for? That's what I thought, it's not on the Talking about introducers, right. That's the participants that I've got, do you wanna have a check of it, see if there's anybody that's been missed off. I thought th yeah I thought this was a fair old crowd anyway. Yeah well hopefully there won't be anybody that missed off but Have I've got a com er s sort of complaint Take it away I er I thought it was the way you were sitting Bob from erm Andy there's a party and a units party but he doesn't know anything about a units party. the wrong team hasn't he? So I said, so I said it's not fully delivered yet. But are we gonna do something? No listen we don't, I need to speak to Chris about it but erm is Andy on that list? Andy wouldn't be from There's a couple of 's people on there. There's a lot of people here who have left as well but er Well once they've got the valuations in and switches and it's not till June No well we might well it might be that we say we want a combined party, I don't know, what the hell does he have to do with it? write the veto Oh right. We'll blackball him for a start playing so, it'll be a bit like, it'll be like the party sort of Erm, talking about erm parties and things, erm we ought to have a social event for client services I think, certainly sooner rather than later, particularly with regionalization looming. Just wondered if we could get something organized, don't know what to do. But I thought that erm barn dance or something like that would be favourite cos it's not too expensive and it's something that everybody can muck in on. Any other good ideas? Get it done quite cheaply in, in Harlow. Presumably we, are we charging staff for this? Are we charging staff for it? We won't have to pay for it will we? Or are we getting it out of our own budget? No I think we'll have to charge something. Well I Well in that case I can probably get something towards it but but not Well in that case I think the cheapest cheapest alternative yeah is erm, if you're gonna do er something like that, would be a barn dance in the hall down Edinburgh Way er which you get quite cheap Oh it's about hundred and fifty quid. no the football team organized a disco there. I I know a barn dance caller who's recently offered his services. Oh right, is that from Surrey? Yeah but I don't know what what he'd charge for coming up. Yeah, okay. Can we But I could ring can we explore that? Mm. And see if we get something set up, probably I think May would be favourite wouldn't it? It's not too far away and it's not too close to the, the changes and some of the announcements will be out by then. Kevin's just arrived so I'll go and get Kevin in, erm copy of what was broadly speaking agreed of which Phil's already got a copy anyway. So's everybody else I think. Yeah oh have you? Oh right, oh sorry about that. Has it changed at all? Sorry? No. Hasn't changed at all? No. Yeah Wednesday the twenty first we're it's Tuesday evening Yeah. Right now well all I, I ex I knew that you were having meetings about it so really all, all I need you to do is actually get this validated by your group and if there were any change significant changes you wanted to make then to come back to me and David with that those suggestions but erm it struck me that th the thing hangs together quite well. Erm so, in principle we've agreed that schedule, er I'm waiting for erm Bob to sort V I out and the name erm as you may be aware erm Bob wants to call it client servicing and our view was that by and large it wasn't a question of having to have loads more different screens we just needed them in different areas and they could, they'd go to Louise to get where people were going to be and it's mostly about the R S six thousand for commission erm on which there are only about twenty of those anyway, twenty seven so I didn't really see that as being a major issue. The only thing I said was about T S G and David said that Good idea really. Yeah. Even though you can't tell any difference after they've finished. Yeah. I see well it's convenient that it comes at the end of a week's holiday isn't it? Pardon? It means they all get an extra couple of days off on their holiday doesn't it? No we do don't You do. Do you think they're all there then or are they all in at school? Pardon? Do you think they're all in at school? No No. They're skiving. They're all skiving are they they're all wagging off Lesley. Well enjoy your tomorrow when you go back. Where do we need for a Kids' County where are we after? Pardon? Where are we after the Kids' County you know what you rang up for in the first place? Sorry talking to me and I'm totally Dennis McCarthy. No it's not. Who who's there heckling Lesley? Er Philip and Andy. Philip which one's your boyfriend then? . Philip? Social injustice is brought on by an economic policy perpetuated by the Tories and their . It is our duty the G M B to stop the decline in social injustice and its damage to the U K. There have been many attacks on our society the trade used by taking our finances and yet, by their economic mistakes and profitization , we, the ordinary working people, pick up the bill. They may have sacked the Chancellor but they're still committed to capitalism and economic policy which is diametrically opposed to any form of such a justice. So as hey, the need for our welfare state, good health service, education, social housing and all the rest. The labour trade union movement to meet the needs and that's of our people. Congress, pick up your rulebooks and look at page seven,Clause nine Rule two. It's all there to promote or support legislation especially in connection with the legal rights of trade unions, industrial, health, safety and welfare and social economic and social welfare. Congress,need for this motion. This is already happening. it's for our people. I second. Motion two seven nine London Region to move. Mr President. Brian, before you start, no laughing this time, I couldn't stand it again. Honestly. I've been on tablets all night. Alright, alright. Brian , London Region moving motion two seven nine. Mr President, other honoured guests. This motion condemns rise in unemployment caused by the incompetent handling of the Tory government's economic policies and I ask for support of the T U C campaigns for the unemployed, but I would beg really that when we do campaign, the T U C gives us more than two days to notify us of rallies and meetings. Like other unions we suffer from the severe loss of members due to unemployment and we are appalled at the devastation of family life when the breadwinner's been sha cast on the scrap heap and the behaviour of the government it throws whole communities into depravity without a chance of any hope for the future and their children. Mining communities, the dock areas, Liverpool, all these people the only crime, the only crime they've ever committed is to stand up for their rights. The unemployed are having their links with hope destroyed with the closure of some C A Bs due to government and local government cuts. Unemployed centres are underfunded and closed, so the only hope left is us, the trade union movement. I know some regions send messages out to their members who've just lost their jobs, expressing hope that they desire please stay with us, we can help ya. This at Hogmanay. Yes. Always a fancy dress, it was always and sausages. Generally that night. When was that when was that started? Well that was when we was before fifty five sixty year ago it was you see. Mhm. Mhm. But well I'd have been in my teens then. Mhm. And is was that over in No no it was in the drill hall. They called it the drill hall then it's now the community centre but it's the drill hall.

It was g gifted to the island by the W I. Mhm. W I started in nineteen twenty four. What was that like when it started? Well it was just something similar to what it is now. Mhm. Yes.

Oh the men you see, er the men were invited certain times like for whist drives and that and the dances and they oh they all When the The called it the Silly Women Running Idle, but that was just for fun. Mm. But they were all erm delighted with it I would say. and the whist drives was always Yes they they amalgamated then this parties and that and they had the you see. And then the North end .

That was what I I wrote and I well I read that out to them at the at that night. That night Very good. Yes. that was last year. Yes that was the diamond jubilee.

And they had one down here And they had one here at the Y what they call the Y M. at a hut down here. Y M C A . Well they did er they'd dance and whist and did different things like that. Just did games . And they had competitions then and they had competitions with the South End you see. North End against the South End. Same as they had the football teams. They had the South End football and football team and the North end football team and the football team. I never remember the football team. to the matches like but I remember the North End and the South End. Willie would mind the . Yes he would mind it he would been he was in it. Aye. And then they went to the different islands and I remember this for when we were at the hotel me brother and me went across, well me was on it too we were all young then. And we went across in small boats to Sanday and what a night. What a bad night. It was just really terrible I mean the first I was just scared stiff that I never couldn't enjoy the dance on Sanday I was that scared of the thought coming back . It was terrible, about twenty of us in that boat. you know it was small boats. Did you do that a lot then, back and forth ? Yes and and then when the lifeboat came, the Eday and and Sanday and them a lot of them came across for the dances, the lifeboat dances, it was really I would say the best time Yes. you know, for the people amalgamated. We had grand times. Beauti lovely dances. Robbie and then they had a boat and they went across. Jim told me they went he went and fore sixteen times one night. putting folk there and come back, and putting them and coming back and he then he did, that was four loads he would have had you see and then had to take them all back home again. It was it was good gr grand times I would say. There wouldn't have been many on the island then was there? No. No. No. No. Well if you start thinking,everyone that's in the island's nearly . For my father came from Westray well he was an incomer from Westray. When I say incomers I mean folk Yes No No. I mean, I know . Mhm. Well mother belong to Stronsay. Yes. Father came from Westray. Did she tell you anything about what life was like when she was young? Yes she used to tell us and my me gran used to tell us and She used to tell us about the you see they weren't allowed to make er malt and that. You know bre for brewing. They brewed ale you see. Ale ale was one of the things that they ate they they drank they put ale on their porridge. Yes. Because they would have likely made their butter unsalted butter. Yes. And they put ale like home-brew ale on their porridge. My gran used to always used to do that . And she used to tell us like and and things like that. And she said about the she said about this er when they made this malt. There were a man that used to come and they called him the gauger well we would likely call him the customs officer now. Yes. The excise man. Mhm. And he used to come and they could see him coming for he had to come in a cart. And they used to dig a hole and bury it. And she used to tell me about her burying it with her father you see, the sacks of malt so that he didn't find it. Oh yes. And was it a Stronsay man that was the gauger or No no he came from he would have come from Kirkwall. Mm. Mhm. And then you see there were no telephones and things then. No telephones, nothing like that. Just telegrams to begin mainly. And when the Orcadian came to Stronsay, the paper, the a man used to read he used to get the Orcadian and read the news on the pier. They tell me that yes. Oh yes. Mhm. Mhm. Everybody didn't have Orcadian like what they have now. Mhm. It was just a very low part, there was a little shopping area just round there at the time er, a butcher's shop and a greengrocer's shop and a Post Office, Street was the Post Office on the corner, and then Street and Road which lead down into , Lane and just round oh just round there you see, but I was born at the last house in the Street almost at the bottom of Street. Now then what else do you want to know? What sort of house was it? Oh just an ordinary house, nothing er nothing pretentious. A terraced house? A terraced house yes, yeah. And how many rooms downstairs? Three up three down. And where did you move from there? We went into Street for a few years and then we came up here in nineteen twenty eight. Erm why did they move to Street, your family? Oh it was a bigger house, better house altogether ah that was a very nice house, a very nice garden as well. Was that sort of house typical of the area? Well it was a question in those days whether you got a bay window or a flat window I mean erm the houses down Street are better quality I suppose really er all property around there is rented, I mean no one bought the houses at all not even up , I mean they were all rented houses. Er and I remember, I remember Street West, when the right hand side of Street west going from Road, every house was empty before the First World War and they gave somebody er somebody who lives in the end one and they were rent free if they keep all the rest clean, and always you see house to let where wherever it was in every street there was houses to let, and the price of the house in Street must be about eight shillings a week in those days, and then if you went up to I mean you'd get in the twelve and sixpenny bracket and down in, those houses down in the that they were ten and six or something like that er So would you say that that was the smart side of ? Oh yes yes, yes you'd say that was the smart side of Caldmore, but er What ways did the families differ then that lived in those sort of houses to the families that lived in the terraced houses ? Oh I I think, think that they differed in as far as they were a tiny little bit more ambitious and wanted a sort of erm a a little bit better life, but everybody even in the terraced houses they were all very respectable people, very respectable people I mean er I Were any of the families considered rough? No, no I can, I can honestly say that I don't think there was any, any what you can call rough families as I can remember. Now you take all those, take Street and Street, they were all very respectable people and er I don't think you could say there were any slums about at all as far as I can remember. Now you go to Road and Street and round there, probably that wasn't quite as er as nice but Street and Street they were very nice people, very respectable. So some streets were considered better than others? Oh yes yes er I should say that er Street er Street then you get into Palfrey now you see Palfrey was a little bit less due to the fact that there were a hell of a lot of railway men at work down there, I mean really all belonging to some department on the railway, you get er drivers and all the men and the permanent way of being in Street I mean a lot of people from Palfrey lived down lived in Palfrey was working in the permanent way in Street, so it was a really, Palfrey you could say was a railway community. Now if you come to Caldmore, you'll find out then that the majority of the married ladies had worked in I mean I should say that erm I know my mother was very snooty she'd been an apprentice to some dressmakers in Street and work for one year for nothing she always used to tell me, and she was quite er toffee- nosed about these girls that used that er that used to go, well they were very respectable people, and when I was a kid when I growing up in my teens a lot of the girls I used to know were in the offices at er it they employed about fifteen hundred people at in those days you know I mean coming out of at night it was fighting your way against the crowd if you were going towards it, and the same thing going through the square for people who have worked in when they left that's why all those shops in the square used to do reasonably well, it was the people walking through to go up the other side of Walsall, but there was a crowd of people I can, I can always remember as a kid a crowd of people and then there'd be well you can tell it was along Street in those days I can remember fruiters' carts where the girls used to go and buy apples, and that all sort of going along there you know people used to wait for them coming out, these are my impressions as a kid I mean I can remember the, the er and the men of course were cutters and various people and a quite a lot of my father's friends were, were er had er skilled jobs at as cutters and managers of the cutters' department and that sort of thing. Then, then of course there weren't no traffic signs in the middle of the road, it was a sort of er certain people from went and started that up and er they were all wor all worked in Caldmore it was almost as though the tailoring Caldmore was full of tailors in a way then there were people starting up on their own making clothes, but er there was quite a lot of tailors around er I know there was he'd got a shop on Caldmore, he was a tailor and er shall we go through all the shops? Yes. Well we'll start off at the top of Road and on the one side there was the furniture people they used to make furniture. Did they make it on the premises? Oh yes they made it Miss has just died erm then coming down there was the Post Office with old Pa and the, then the Miss , they used to keep the Post Office, then there was er well there was a gents outfitters and then there was a beautiful shop I always used to think, it was called, another , but it was confectioners, but it was all most delightful old oldy-worldy sort of shop and my mother often used to go in there then you'd Tell me a bit more about that shop then. About that shop. There was a Victorian air about it somehow there were, there were quite ladies who'd kept it, almost the same sort of thing as you'd find out in the country, country Ye Olde Elizabethan Coffee Shop type of thing you know, they they'd be the er there was that atmosphere about it and you'd buy lovely cakes and things like that. Then coming on to the end of Street next door was a milliners, now that nobody knows what they are today Miss the name was and then coming across Street to the other side was which was a drapers, and next coming down was Smiths the butcher's shop, and next to that was the grocers, following on down there was the ironmonger, then there was the newspaper, and you come down to the White Hart erm then we come to the White Hart Do you remember anything about that? Oh yes er I think somebody kept it around father's day, a chap named , but it was a beautiful old place and he always, because my father always used to erm start off about seven o'clock in the morning to walk down to Walkers and er call in at the White Hart because they were open at six o'clock in the morning, for a rum and coffee for about tuppence or thruppence, then he always used to er go to his mother's for his breakfast and er he used to go down and see all the men start off and then, then slip over to his mother's, she lived on the Road and er she, for years and years this went on that he had his break he never had his breakfast at home he'd start off going down there and come back to his mother's, but he always stopped at the White Hart for his rum and coffee Did many people go in ? Oh yes yes oh well yes for a rum and coffee yeah, and I'm afraid it was very acceptable on a winter's morning, but erm now we come, we've come on that side of Road, we'll now start at the top of Road again and come along as far as er what I call Street I believe it's now where St Michael's church is, and you come to Sammy the butchers. Now Sammy was a character in himself he was a bachelor and his wi his sister was Fanny the elocutionist er and, and er there the women used to, to go into old Sammy's shop on a Friday night simply to be entertained by all the wisecracks and nonsense that used to go on in there, and somebody would say I suppose you're off this weekend and he'd say yes I'm off to my little widow in Wales, he hadn't got a little widow in Wales at all now but it would the start of the conversation going. My mother's been up there and she didn't come back for two hours and she came back we kept well he'd sold a lot of meat in the meantime. The next three shops was which was a er he become I think in the finish but it was a toy shop and then you came to er the fruiters, on the other side of Street, and you came down to er little pawnshop. I, I shall be seeing the you know in a few weeks time the daughter she's a, she's er Rene that was erm Eddie , who were very big pals of mine and we go to the anniversary lunch together so we're all over eighty but erm you couldn't the bread shop, was another confectioner's shop, and then turning round the corner you come to another shop, up two steps, which was and that was another type of confectionery and shop, then you get as far as the corn and seed people er they used to have a shop in Street as well, and then before the First World War there was the butchers and they sold foreign meat. Fourpence ha'penny a pound this New Zealand lamb was I remember. Mother wouldn't have anything to do with it whatsoever, don't you bring anything, any of that stuff into our house, I mean of course it be this New Zealand lamb had just arrived on the scene before the First Word War, I mean nobody was, anybody dare have it I mean they'd be standing on the pavement at eleven o'clock at night almost giving it away on Saturday night, but anyway that's all changed now, we all eat it. Then you got to er the picture house er that happened just before the First World War that was put up as far as I can remember, I know I used to go there and see erm the Broken Coin which was a serial picture and it was you know er where somebody was up to their neck in water one week and it would say that the continuation of this picture would be shown in this theatre one week from today and you . what was it like inside? Pardon? What was it like inside? Nice, very nice, you went up a long hall toward, as soon as you got er through the doors it was very nice really, quite, quite something for Caldmore anyway. Then on the corner of Street and Green was the tobacconist shop. Then coming along Street you come to the picture frame people and then the Conservative Club, then there was the big house further on towards the top of Street and that was owned by somebody named Winnie , was my second wife's she went to school with her they used but her father lived there, and on the other side of the road you got the toy shop and er the draper's shop on the corner of er Road then there was the newsagents and one or two people kept that, but that takes you from the top of Street straight the way up to Caldmore. Now on Green, now we go, we've come along from the top of Street right along Road, the toy shop then you get to the Kings Arms and on the other side of the road there was another pub and I can't remember the name of it, then there was the fish shop and then the Liberal Club then the pork butchers you'd think they were all full of meat. There were a lot of butchers. Butchers and er then there was the butchers and that was on the corner of and er and and then cross over there towards Street you've got the stores, then you come the, the er drapers, then er Tommy the butcher who was my first wife's uncle and then you come to a shop which was owned by one or two people, which was a sort of er general store and then my mother-in-law's shop a cook's which was What sort of shop was that? Which was a bakers and confectioners, they used to er bake at the, they got the er the bakehouse at the back and they used to make confectionery and high class bread. And what sort of shop was it itself was it a large shop? Oh quite a nice shop, yes very nice shop. Would they display the bread? Oh yes, yes in the, in the window yes I think and many and many a ticket I got when I first got married to my first wife I used to do my mother-in-law's little tickets for all the various custards, and, and Eccles cakes and four for thruppence ha'penny it doesn't of course I could print right you see she said, being a draughtsman I always could print right so I used to do the four for thruppence ha'penny. How much are they today? Well I bought, I bought three custards the other day and I think they were about fifty three pence. Have you got any special memories about any of these shops at all for any reason? Any that you used to go in a lot that you can tell me about? Perhaps for instance. Oh yes I used to go and fetch the er erm I used to go into every week, oh there was the maypole next to as well. I used to go and fetch the, the butter from don't bring margarine my father used to say we put better stuff on our machines so er I used to go to for my father kept foul, I used to fetch a peck of, bushel of this and a bushel of, you know all the various things that, bran and stuff for the foul yes, yes and I believe a lady, she has, she's only recently died and but she kept it for a long long while Elsie her name was. And what was it like inside were ? Oh yes, sacks of other and they used to have a proper corner seedman's shop, which you don't see about today the er Garden Centre has knocked all that on the nut hasn't it really? What about chemist. Whereabouts was that? That was er coming down from Street you come to then you come to the grocers and was next- door there that's the only link with Caldmore as it used to be and Caldmore as it is now Maybe because it's still there. Yes probably yes. And what sort of shop was it in your day when you were young Michael? Oh quite a nice shop. I used to know, I used to play at tennis with Bay , the daughter and er the eldest daughter she married another chemist and he ran the place afterwards I think, then there was Jack but er I, I used to know, I used to know quite a lot of the er people on the, who kept these shops. Was it the sort of chemist that erm was it the sort of chemist that you'd go in if you'd got something the matter with you and rather than go to the doctor, they would sort of dole out something for you? Well I've never had the experience and I don't think my family have, I er no I shouldn't think it was really, they might, I suppose somebody, they used to have a reputation at one time these chemists was doing minor, giving you something for some minor ailment, but I wouldn't care to sort of er, I'd never think of it, no there were quite a lot of doctors about you know, there was er Doctor at the top of Road and there was Doctor , Doctor oh there was a lot of doctors about. Were you sent to Sunday School when you ? Oh yes rather. Which one did you used to go to? Well my mother was one of the pillars of the Palfrey church and er she er oh I went, my father never used to go, but she used to go and of course I, I used to be an altar server down there when I got a bit older I did for a week or two to the erm do you know anything about an Anglo-Catholic Church I mean where they swing the incense and there is this little boy with the boat? I was that for about, I soon got fed up with that job. How old were you when you did that? Oh about eight, seven or eight, but when we first went there the honourable S G W was the vicar, fourth son of the Earl of and er, oh you he was there then afterwards er Father came, and I used to do altar serving oh I was never interested in it you know I was forced into it. Who forced you into it? My mother I remember there was a sale of work going on at Palfrey church once and bef I had just been made apprentice at Wolverhampton and of course I got amongst the, they, when they came the, the Derby day they were all having a bet on it so I, I said to the give them half a crown, so he said you can't have half a crown and he said what do you want it for so I said they're putting it on a horse was on this horse it won, so of course this sale of work was in great progress when I gets off the train at station and thought well I couldn't understand in er Palfrey Church Hall, so she was there in all her finery and I said we've won, we've won she said shut up, shut up she said but erm no I think the biggest character in Caldmore was Father . What do you remember about him? Oh I don't, I just, I remember that er if you walked down er Road at night you'd see him with his mortar board on and his curate by his side coming down to to post the letters, and then when all these ladies were in Sammy shop one night being entertained by Sammy erm Father and his curate went by, and old Sammy turned round to the audience and said well if dressing up will get him anywhere they'll be on the first row in heaven. I was there that night I was, sometimes when I was a little boy I used to go with my mother you know to, for the ent I didn't know whether, yells of laughter used to come out of his shop. I'm trying to explain to you that there was a different atmosphere about it, the whole situation, I know they were hard times, I know that some people had some really rough times but it didn't show very much, and when I come to think of all my parents' friends I don't remember anybody having a wife bashing episode or they all seemed to be very contented with their lot somehow except one, and that was a little bit dicey when I was a little kid, but the man died and the Observer the next week the er obituary notice was put in the paper and underneath they'd got, with Christ which is far better and my father said and they she couldn't have said anything better words Do you remember anything more about Father ? Yes oh I ee I, I'm led to understand that he, he built that church and I'm led to understand that at the same time he started, he came as a curate to St Matthew's and then he came to Street into a house and he had a little, he started a little church down there in a private house and then he built the church. He very wealthy, but oh dear dear he was a, he was a, tyrannical I should call him, I know for a fact that he used to before the choir walked in at night he'd have his watch out in his hand and they'd start at exactly the same time. I remember when he always used to read out during the service before the sermon the previous week's collection and it used to consist of the collection last Sunday consisted of one pensioning note, twenty ha'penny half crown pieces, forty florins and he'd go all through the coinage down to the last ha'penny but erm oh I believe he was, he was er very aristocratic, very aristocratic, but er Father , cos he used to come over our house quite a lot when my mother was on the parochial church council, and er he had a curate that was quite leftish and he got himself on the old Board of Guardians and of course he used to sort of er go into the Labour Club and was quite of er father, he said to old Father one night he said erm he's a funny chap your curate he said well he , he's the son of a farm labourer he says and I'm the son of a country squire and that's the difference. So that was the attitude hey, but erm they'll have me up for libel here. Tell me about some of these other characters around, can you recall anyone? Well old was, was er absolute er you'd never think anybody'd would buy anything out of his shop, er my father went in for something once and he, and he said you can see them hanging up can't you, I mean er salesmanship was on unheard of as far as he was concerned they were there, why ask him if he'd got any, but erm course you must remember I was only a little boy I mean I can remember all this, I took it all in but I wouldn't say that I knew them er I knew Miss , from the grocer's shop she was a Sunday School teacher, and er the Sunday School used to be at Road School we used to have a Sunday School there and a Mr used to take this. He was another character er there was er I remember they used to have a lot of socials and things at the church you know, it was very well attended I suppose in those days. Don't know what it's like now. What about the Conservative Club and the Liberal Club did they, were they more social clubs? Oh yes, er yes they were, they were er of course there was a great divide there I mean between the Liberals I mean they were the only two parties in those days. The Conservative Club was there before the, the Liberal Club. I think if the Liberal Club was only like First World War it wasn't there it hasn't always been there but the Conservative Club was there as long as I can remember. Do you recall any of the activities that were associated with either of them? Did what? Do you recall any of the activities that were associated? Well I was in the tennis club when I was a er they used to have a tennis court at the back. Which club was that? Conservative Club, and my wife she wa we were both members there oh and there was a, I tell you another shop that probably I haven't mentioned, just before you get to the White Hart there was Thompsons the butcher's shop with er they got three or four er daughters I remember. Why do you think there were so many butcher's shops? there was a lot of meat I suppose really I mean erm answer. I mean were there sort of different quality meats being sold all the rest were No difference No of course one or two of them had slaughter houses at the back of them you know. I see I mean er Which were those? Well Tommy used to slaughter all his cattle and er you see my father-in-law's bakehouse and his slaughter house were next to one another an open yard at the back of the shops and er How did the cattle arrive? Oh driven up from the station from the, from the goods yard oh yes. Was that in Street Walsall or ? Yes a long street or somewhere around there, and yes I mean many oh many a time I've, you'd see ca every Wednesday night you'd see the cattle being driven up. Always the same night was it? Yeah, and one got stuck in the, there was an entry between my father-in-law's shop and the next one and one of these cattle ran down the entry and got stuck in the entry, you know it was only narrow and the they had to shoot it, but er oh yes it was a, that was a thing you never hear of today and you never hear of people putting tannin down when people are ill do you? You see Walsall being a leather town there was a lot of this er bark tannin as went and when anyone who was ill so they wouldn't hear the noises of the horse driven vehicles going by they used to, for about fifty yards each side of the house they used to put this stuff in the road to deaden the sound. Do you recall this being done? Oh yes. And what, where did this happen that you remember? Oh I've known it happen all over Caldmore. So it was a regular happening? Oh yes they put this, this tannin down it was like a bark I don't know what it was cos I'm not in the leather trade, I, I don't know much about it except that it was some by-product from the of the er tanning process, and they used to put this stuff down when people were ill. So with you mentioning leather then it leads me onto another question erm was there much done in the way of leather work in the Caldmore area? Oh rather yes, out-work, people used during the First World War there were no end of people were sort of er especially if they'd had a bit of experience in the leather industry like harness and saddlery and that sort of thing, especially the harness and er other work attached to leather cavalry and er revolver holsters and that sort of thing, they'd do them at home you know oh yes there was er now Walsall's divided isn't it? It's got leather and, and iron and steel, now you come onto the Road and you wouldn't think there a leather factory about would you? Because from top to bottom it was all connected with iron and steel the whole lot all the way down. You go from er Hopeworths, Mason and Burnhams, John , Gill and Russells, Walker Brothers it was er a terribly industrial, well you could fi Road used to be all granite sets in the road, there wasn't the, because there was so much traffic went up and down er it was all made of granite sets when I, when I was a kid, but my, shall I tell you what I used to do when I was a kid for my Saturday morning? Well first of all I'd go down Street and up Street West and up to the top of Street and there was some puddling furnaces, the new side iron works and I'd watch those men they'd produce wrought iron and during the process the metal boils up and I'd have to get a big rubbling bar and rubble they'd call rubble into a ball, there's a little wagon put underneath the put under the wagon and off he goes to the steam hammer, now I used to be fascinated with this and Saturday after Saturday I used to go up there and watch one of the heats and as soon as they'd finished doing they used to go into the Forge and Hammer for a drink, I mean it was such hard work so they'd do a heat go up the Forge and Iron and come back and then do another heat when I'd How long would it take to do a heat? Oh I should think it would be the best part of an hour and er then I'd go along Street down into Walker Brothers call in my father's office. Can I go in the rolling mills? I used to go into the rolling mills and watch them rolling steel sheets and over about half an hour there, this was Saturday after Saturday after Saturday I used to do this. I'd come along Road and up Lane into Street to a shop that had got rabbits in the window. I used to walk along there to see these rabbits I think the name was and they, it was a barber's shop that had got these sold all sorts of pet things and that I used to, then I used to come home that was my Saturday morning, but I always used to go in up to the news line. Now the funny thing about it, when I took metallurgy I got, I, I got all this process I knew all about it you know, and er I had it the theory explained to me then, but er I was in the Bell one day about twenty years ago and an old boy came in and I started talking to him and he says, I bet you don't know what I am? I said no I don't, he said well what I was anyway he said I'm retired now. He says you'll never guess. I said well what was it? He says I was a puddler. I said, were you? He said you don't know what that was, that is do you? I said I do a bit, so er he said, well do you know anything about it? I said a bit, and I never let him know, I thought I'll wait a little bit until he go so he says to me, he says I bet you don't know why they put the damper in just before they'd put the, bring the ball out do you? I said yes I do, he says you know? I said course I know I said to put some of the carbons from the smoke back into the, into the er wrought iron, he says how did you find that out? And I told him that er all about it, but I said do they make, do they do this puddling these days, he says yes at West Bromwich they still do it, but er they used to do it up on Do you recall what they used to wear? Moleskin trousers. Were there any protective gear of any kind? No no just the used to wear like a, a pork pie hat. Did he wear anything in par No no no no not that I know of. Did you see them load the furnace? Oh yes they used to put pig sc iron and scrap in it. Pig iron you know er pig iron was what they had I've seen them pouring furnaces pouring it onto the pig beds, and you know when I was a kid when we lived in Caldmore from about half past nine at night all across West Bromwich, Wednesbury all over that area, you'd see the sky light up and it was due to the pouring of er pouring the pig iron. They open up the these blast furnaces and the, we'd all be in the open air and the reflection there used to be quite a reflection in the sky all round there. Did, getting back to Caldmore. Erm were there any small workshops around doing odd things you may recall, sort of small set-ups? No I don't think there were, there might have been one or two, yes I do know one that used to make some form of er something for the saddlery trade and you know those houses opposite the alms houses in Road, there are some alms houses on the one side, then there's some houses that lie up steps on the other side of the road if they're still there. The back of there there used to be one or two people who used to have little outhouses where they used to sort of make things, and my grandfather up the Pleck, he was a good locksmith and he had his shop at the back of the house and he cou he could watch the Walsall races going on, which is now where the Road is, from his workshop before Street was put and any of those and he could stand in his workshop and watch the races. And when would that be? Oh oh in the eighteen nineties I should think eighteen eighties, eighteen nineties. And did he have any men working for him or did he work on his own? Yes he er he had a nephew for part time but he was a now he was a Wolverhampton Grammar School boy. His two brothers both died with smallpox cos one was, they all three went to Wolverhampton Grammar School and they were a Wednesbury family and they died with the smallpox but I thought they were putting the youngest which was my grandfather for the best trai one was going in for law and the other was going in for medicine, and the youngest was go which was the same as engineering is today I suppose, and he went into the gun trade, and I can remember him, he was a grand old chap and er he used to come and bring the springs that he'd made and to temper them he used to throw them in the kitchen fire, and they'd die out and get them all out of the ashes in the morning, and he used to take his week's work in his waistcoat pockets and his day out was to get on the tram at the Brown Lion, and go straight through Wednesbury and right through West Bromwich up to the Constitutional in Birmingham to Greeners or Wembley and Scotts and he'd got these gun locks as he'd made during the week in his waistcoat pockets. They were very small then? Yeah. That's interesting. Yes and er my mother was frightened to death of guns because, oh he was a bit of a boy at heart I mean you can just imagine everybody used to bring the sporting guns to be repaired and there was guns floating about all over the place, and my mother was scared stiff of guns right till the time she died er, and he got mixed up with all these sporting connections you know like go off to shoots and various things and I think he did a bit of cock fighting in his day as well, but I've, I've got the exercise books that his two brothers. Do you want to see them? You can show me? I can show you afterwards aye you can have a look at them and see what you think about them. Erm yes aye that's the Pleck that's not Caldmore you know. Yes yes but very interesting all the same. Yeah oh yes he oh and he was erm being better educated than the majority of people in the Pleck he used to stand outside the Brown Lion to read the newspaper out to them cos they couldn't read, and he attended all the weddings, all the funerals and er made the wills out and he almost was the father confessor for the Pleck, and when the old steam tram came off the lines down in the Pleck, when there was a steam train coming through there, he was the man who put it on the rails again. What was his name? John . Tell me about transport through Caldmore when you were a young man. Do you mean public transport? Well both sorts. Non-existent until about I shouldn't think there was an a bus did come to the bottom of Road, I can't remember what was, it must have been about nineteen twenty I suppose something like that, it used to go to the bottom of Road and turn round there, but I never er my mother always used to say you'd ruin the trade, the trade down well I don't believe it did really er now I think the lack of transport now you've hit something there, lack of transport there encouraged people to shop in Green rather to go down the town cos you could get anything off Green you know, you just think you'd ju you, you smiled about the er butcher's shops, the grocer's shops, the cake shops, you could get the gents , you could get anything on Green the ironmonger shop, you needn't go anywhere else but, when they started transport er yes I think the buses had quite a bit gradually cos things that, you don't think get things happening in this country overnight I mean, they grow on you don't they? I mean you get a bus coming as far as Road and back I don't suppose it has half a dozen folks on what's this thing coming up here, nobody I'd er I've walked into Walsall all my life and but gradually the whole thing changes doesn't it, and then the thing gets off as far as West Bromwich, and in, then, then there's through traffic and then how far and the Green's not big enough to take the turn around up Road then they change the direction, and it's all done on bit by bit by bit and so Green's got eroded it's er So they took bits of Green away then? Oh yes they did for, for the increase in traffic I mean that er that er went on over the years gradually creep, creep, creep on until the whole atmosphere of the place was er I don't know improved should you say or not I don't know whether it's er well it certainly hasn't improved but erm it changed, it was such a lovely little place really, and of course you could run across the road whenever you liked I mean we used to play in Street of picking out in a sweet shop window er a name be Cadbury's or chocolate or something you'd be standing across the road and you'd be running backwards and forwards backwards and forwards, there was no sign of anyone getting run over cos there was nothing about, and when I was a kid going to the Bluecoat School I'd run across that bridge every morning without looking right or left, because if anything had hit me, well nothing used to be coming you could see a tram coming but oh there was nothing else at that time in the morning oh no it was, wouldn't like to run across today. What about private transport in Caldmore about this time, how was, what was that? Do you mean somebody who owned a er some kind of vehicle, tradesmen some of the tradesmen did but not many that I can remember, no I don't think there was too many of them. Would private individuals have their own transport? No no no no there was nobody, now er probably up at the top of Gallway there though one or two would have er stables I should think, one or two of those houses, but by and large no I shouldn't think so. Now there is another, another part it's very nice and that is round Lane and er Road and all round there used to be very nice at one time. Do you know it? Er I can't er Were there any open rural areas? Oh yes. Yes my playground. Go up Road, and from there turn down Follyhouse Lane the continuation of it and you'd come right to the Dales and nothing at all from there to West Bromwich, and you could see, if you go over one stile from one field then onto another and then brook that now runs through the Road there, that used to be a little country brook that run across the golf course and there was a little stile over it, a little bridge and a stile, then you go straight up to Dells common and not a house in sight. Was it open farmland? No , cut straight across it. I mean that's what cut straight the way across that it was, it was all and my aunt she used to live by All Saints West Bromwich, we never used, we never went to see them we used to walk it down the road past the Boars Head onto the Navigation Inn, and up by the Sandlow and she used to live opposite er All Saints Church in West Bromwich, and erm coming back we should come back round midnight you know and er have you ever heard of the Whirly Gang? Yes. Has that come up in your er in your well we were coming back there one night from my aunt's and er there were quite a lot of policemen about and I was only a little boy, it was before the First World War and my father said to one of these policemen, what's happening so, oh we had a tip-off he says that er there's these Whirly Gang folks and in the morning we saw somebody'd been maimed or killed, but er that was another bit of interesting news around, and I remember down in Caldmore one day there used to be some ladies who used to come from, well they used to be, one of them used to call them the salt ladies, they used to come with blocks of salt on a, on a I think they used to come from and I saw a horse there as a kid and I, it had got a long gash right across its body and I said to this lady I said, what's happened to this, she said oh the Whirly Gang and er I was in Paris in nineteen twenty two and er we got to this hotel and there was another Englishman on this trip and he said to me he said where do you come from? I said Walsall he said oh the Whirly Gang You just mentioned these salt ladies coming round. Yeah. Erm tell me a bit about that. Well all the way from, they used to come from and they used to have some sunbonnets on, I always remember they used to have the, I'm not a dressmaker but you know a la they don't like frills down the back that used to hang down the back and the I remember them coming round selling blocks of salt. Horse and cart? Horse and cart and of course milk was never delivered by, in bottles in those days. I mean that was always a milkman used, there used to be er James was one of the milkmen down Palfrey, he used to come . they used to pour it out of a can you know, it's a wonder we didn't all die of tuberculosis but we didn't. Did anyone else come round the streets selling things? Oh yes the watercress man on a Sunday afternoon and er all the various things were s fruiters, fishmongers, all used to bring their stuff round. How did you know they were in the street, did they have a call? Shout, they'd shout something but er well since we've been living up here, my mother used to give, the man used to come for the order for the grocery, the baker used to come round, the milk used to come round, they all used to come round at she'd ha she didn't have go out for heavy loads of stuff to bring in it was all delivered, but when they started some new technique of er of ordering by computer, it's going to come back to square one again you know, they'll be delivering stuff in the same jolly old way hey. Could be yes. Yes don't you think? Could be yes, yes. Give it fifty years and I'll bet you that the baker and all the rest of the folks, it'll be coming from a supermarket, but they'll be delivering stuff that you've put on your computer. That's right that would be interesting. Hey er well, during, just after the war they started these concerts in the Temperance Hall. Now the Temperance Hall was a very very nice hall er balcony all the way around, it held five or six hundred people er candelabras and all the rest of it, a lovely stage and these travelling concert parties used to come round on a Saturday night, and I should imagine they'd be doing the seasides during the summer and then they came back in the Walsall and various areas during the er winter months, and we used to get concert parties like The Roosters and The Bonbons and all those sort of people come along and they were real and of course fellas my age, I mean eighteen and nine we used to take our girls there I mean it was full of young people er you'd perhaps have been to the pictures one night and it's another way of entertaining really and it was really a first class entertainment. Well my pal and myself we took these two girls and we sat in the middle of the Temperance Hall and he said come on let's sit over on the balcony he says and put up my clothes by the radiator he says it's been raining he says and it will dry them, so we moved, and exactly from were we moved was where the women got killed, just candelabra dropped on her and er when it happened the fella on the stage the comedian was singing, a hundred years from now you won't be here, and I won't be here and from the corner of my eye I could see something gradually dropping like one of these candelabras and I thought hello that's part of the act you know, it was just gradually coming down and all of a sudden, whooosh and the roof came straight in oh and I don't know sure I'd I, everything went dark of course I mean it was all in blacked-out all the chairs were loose, so as the folks wended their way towards the exit doors they took the chairs with them, so they politely threw them back in the crowd that stood in the hall so you were dodging chairs as well as trying to get out, where we were, where we were seated the firemen were hacking at the windows thinking that it was a fire because all the dust had gone up in the air and the reflection of the light from the market I suppose and that would give the appearance of smoke, and he was, I said to this fireman I said there's no fire, he says, he says there is I said there's no fire in here, anyway we eventually got out but I took these girls back home to and I really, it was, properly unnerved us both and as we came on that old tram we were, we thought you know everything seemed to sort of upset us and when I got far more upset on the Sunday morning when I went to have a look at it, the whole roof had come right in, but there were fifty people got injured you know and about, oh there was one lady killed. I knew one at Holland . And he tramped back and forth to the loom. built a house there and got a house there. The laird I think er they did the work and the laird provided the roof and the all the woodwork I think. And he wove? Aye. He had the weaving loom I think at the whether he ever had it set up at the I couldn't say. But he certainly had it at the at the I think, it probably maybe still there, I couldn't say. What kind of cloth did he make? Blankets mainly I think. Well I just couldn't really say. Mainly blankets but they were awful heavy and blankets. There's some of them blankets I think'll be here on North Ronaldsay yet I think. Is it that wouldn't have been North Ronaldsay . Aye. It was I think it was . Mhm. Mhm. No. It was stopped a while afore I mind. Mm. I tell you something I wanted to ask you,Horseman's Society, was that . Never in my time but I've heard it spoken about here. Aye had the Horseman's word some of the older heard the Horseman's word but that was afore me time. No. No. What about farmers unions, did you ever have that conditions that you were working in . Oh no there were there were no unions no. Oh no. No never any any union at all. You were taken on as a boy and er you got a boy's wages but you were expected to do as much work as a man. You couldn't maybe do the ploughing and that but if you were out spreading dung you or neeps you'd to just the same as the men and the the man may man might be getting maybe about twenty pound in the half a year and the boys maybe only getting twelve or something like that. You How long did it take you to work up to getting a full man's wage? Well it'd be about two pound every half a year. So you had to wait Aye. Mhm mhm. Where did you go after Holland? Well I was er twice in Birsay at 's well after he left Holland. And then I was at Crantit. And then I was back at Holland for another four and a half year. And then I was four and a half year in Sanday. And then I was back here then and I worked er at Antabruk for a year and then I work at Cruisbruk and Sydney was at Antabruk then . What was it like at Holland when you came things changed a lot? Well er it was only I'd been a wee while at er Birsay and a wee while at Crantit till I were back at Holland but it was a different farm I was in then it was a bit different. . I was in er Holland. No no. No no. Same name but no connection but the same name. Originally aye. Mhm. And had changed a lot in that time then? It changed a lot basically the with the food and everything. different? Well the the idea of farming was much the same but he certainly was not very much of a farmer. Mm and was his treatment any different. Slightly but then him and me didn't get on. He never wanted me there in the first place. Oh. Well that's . Aye. Mhm. That must have gone on a lot Oh aye. Aye and then he'd leave. In fact he and then Craigie from Rowsay was in it for a while. And he away to Dale in and then the the s took it on and they've been in it since. And it's changed they out-winter the beasts there now, it used to be that the beasts was in all the time in Winter. when I was a boy of fifteen you were expected to to half acre of neeps in the day. Did what to do expect you to get on with and They expect you to get on They tell you what to do and you had to make the best. It must have been a long day for a boy of that age. It was long day you know. Oh maybe Aye. And what what was school like when you you were going to school ? It wasn't so bad er Greenspot was not very far from the school. . And it wasn't so bad. Firstly we had Robbie for a teacher and he certainly was awkward. Was he ? Aye. Did he . Aye. Who was the first teacher ? When I started it was with Ivy , and she were married in North Ronaldsay with the brother of Sydney, Roy . And she was the first teacher and there was Mi Mr who was the head teacher. And er Ivy got married and she stopped the teaching and died just that same year and then there was the a change for the both teachers. Robbie come as the head teacher and er there was a Miss that was er the pupil teacher. Aye. I never had , he was never my teacher for I was I was with a pupil teacher. Until he died and then I was just . And was it two teachers in the school. Aye, mhm. . There were thirty. so maybe but usually thirty. And what sort of things did you do in the in the . What do you remember. Oh I couldn't tell you very much about it. I can't mind . playing. Mhm. Played and and things of that kind. Tell me what is? Well they were usually a line of kids standing along the wall or something and one set out in the middle of the field and then you had to touch them and then you'd be back to the wall and they had to do it. You changed places one of them catch them . Aye. Mhm. Mhm. Aye and mind the lasses they used to play a lot with instead of marbles they were working with . The boys didn't play with No That's funny isn't it The boys was trying to play football or something of that kind. Or if the ground was kind of wet we used to er make slide then and skate along on it and if the ground got dry we would get a old bucket or something and run round to the tap at the tank at the back of the school and get a a lot of water wet till you could slip on it. And that Tell me about Rob Robbie this this teacher Was it Robbie ? It was Robbie Aye. What sort of teaching did he give then? Well he just well he gave us er algebra and geome geometry and maths and that we were no use. and he certainly had not much patience and we had never seen this afore. If you made mistakes you got the strap you didn't even get the strap just for mischief, you got it for for mistakes and that. Aye. Oh every day nearly. Depending on the mood he was in. Ah he was here for what twenty two from thirty two to thirty nine. Mhm. He'd away just at the start of the war. I was left school afore he left. I was when he left. I to the school after I was fourteen just for a wee while. Aye. And I wouldn't let him give me the strap then. What were you Eh? I wou I wouldn't hold out my hand I was fourteen. Really? Mm. If he gave me a shagging I tried my best to get me heel of my boot down on the stair, something of that kind . When you when you were a young boy I was gonna ask get off the island manage to get I was never away off the island until er I started to work at Holland. The first the first half a year that I was Holland I I don't think I was away for a holiday, but then the the next Summer then I was away . Just for er a few days. For the plane was started here then you see. What did you think to it? It was alright we were got a flip on the when the plane first was just started here, well all the schoolboys and that was er called out on Saturdays to gather the loose stones . Gather them in buckets or baskets and cup then in . And we all got a flip on Ronaldsay for our trouble. Was that Mhm. What was it like? Oh it was fine yeah. What was the plane like? Oh we enjoyed it. Was it were there many seats? Aye just was five or six I think. It was the we used er to go into Kirkwall with mainly. The old repeat planes. Oh but he was alright as a pilot. he did some of the flying himself but he had other pilots. I forget, was one of them and I forget the names now.. And what did you think plane someone who'd never been away from Aye. You weren't frightened? Oh no. No. Well was there mus much going back and fore in the boat . Not really that many there were maybe the the holiday trip to Kirkwall maybe just for the day into Kirkwall. My father was maybe in once or twice when I was a boy and he was maybe buying a horse and that but he was very seldom out of the island that I mind. And I don't think I can't mind my mother away at all. i don't think she was ever away for a holiday. Never away . Well she was in her younger days but after she married Aye after I was born I can't mind her being away. You know. My father was not often, maybe once or twice would for buying a horse or change a horse or something of that kind. He went into Kirkwall. Mhm. Mhm. What happened when you were . Did did you Sometimes aye, some of the drovers come out you see and . Mhm. Aye. Steamers were only used once a fortnight, if there was weather. Sometimes you'd maybe not get a steamer for maybe maybe six weeks if the wind was to the South East. getting er low on sugar and stuff er landed here with a plane.. It must have been a big difference when the plane was . Mhm. Do you remember that as being a Oh aye, aye well you see they had they had the mail service here before the war. To North Ronaldsay. And then er it was stop Well, what worked well? Er, giving people specific jobs, like, combining one . Right, how did you do yours? Your group? Well we decided, decided what we w , what the object was, and then, we got into a position that certain cards so, the cards were split between u , the two of us, so we aimed it in different directions. So you divided into two teams? Yes, and then we decided to pick them up, played back . Right, okay, anybody else can add anything that they felt worked well? We decided to dip into , and pick one each. yes, the same, the same thing there. What went badly? I got one from Mars I think. Then I went back in and did it again. What you made, made a mistake. In er,, you know, we only reversed when we got to the bottom of that last machine, and why had the guy back, erm, went over it, and go through it again, luckily it was only three high. So you had , would anybody of, if they were going to do it again, do it differently? No, oh yes, nick all the cards and played myself on the tune Yes, When we did all work together, all the different pieces worked together, and you could just have a card each and you could have just done it that way. But when you've got forty three , they'll just taking ground anywhere. Could you be fighting basically to see what was what. If you can relate back to branches, everybody was just running around, everybody's had a specific task to do, you were just running round like a , We could have just collected all the cards up, put them in the middle of the car park and all just stood over them . It worked quite well, Speak for yourself, I know I have to look at it, I I noticed, er, I felt three of the groups had somebody centrally who, who was being fed information all the time. I mean, er, in terms of planning what, what did you say at the beginning? What did you, what did your group talk about at the very beginning? Whether all the cards were running off. The changes, we split up so Yes we did, we sort of divided the team up Good idea So what, what did he ? , three cards each, right so we chose three to look at. Yes, so you divided it up like that And what, what was your idea Jane for your team? Because the, there's two different ones to do, so we split it and two did one, and the other two did the other. So you wasn't like four, five year old in a bed, trying to work it out. It just seemed pointless to do, do what all the, the way down the morning and then after do all the way down the other end . Mm, did anybody do one and then do the next one? We did Yes, did you find that hindered you at all? No I can't say we was hindered through the , We came, we came first, excuse me That why our team did the same as you. Ou , Ou, Our system worked okay for us. We were finished about five minutes before We didn't bother about it much, we've had one member as being two or three of the latest. Right. To share our information. So it was kind of energy conservation, yes It's space more than anything. Alright, well thank you very much for doing that. I hope that got us through the little post-lunch siesta period, erm, we're going to do another er, time management game now which will take about half an hour, and I need to split you up once again into groups, erm, okay. Into three groups of six, so if we have, one, two three, one, two, three, one, two three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three. So we're going to do this exercise within this room and we'll need to rearrange the tables, so I suggest that each group as having one table or two tables, put it in a square to work around. So if you could now get together with your people, all the ones together, all the twos together and all the threes together and rearrange the tables in an area of the room where you'd like to work. , Ones? Twos? Twos? Twos? Threes? Any more threes? Threes? What are you? Three. Right, What you're in your group, if within each group you could elect between you one, a manager and two, an observer. Thank you class, have you all decided on your managers and observers. Yes If I could have all the managers and all the observers, please. If you could come out, and out of the room with me. , The erm, shapes, did you ever have to do that with the thingy in the middle? Erm. You've got er, a sh , a T, we knew it was a T, but it could turn to different shapes, No I didn't do that one And then you have to explain it to the person opposite you, or a long distance phone call, and say how you,, and this, because there was a colour done what I've said, he said my colour's completely different, and you've propose all those colour bits, but They're all different. The object of that was don't assume that people have got a sign for , you know. The beauty of having to describe a shape. , And as they're describing it, you had to draw it. So you had to draw it as they describe it. You're not supposed to be reading the news. ,, Do you know if the answers are in there. Did anybody meet that famous , last night about the, how you find out about people ? I think I told Lisa again. It's one of these assertion things Aye, which thing's that? What, what is the name of that? Which one then? It was body language wasn't it? Aye, it wasn't particular clear though. No What's that? , What did Pete say? It's supposed to be a session. So what, what's that supposed to do, if you brush hair it'll indicate to the, the male kind er, that you're interested and that you wouldn't mind getting in touch with them. It's not that you haven't got , or a black skirt or something. , it's a love story , or something. If all he wants is to hitchhikers doesn't he? I know he does. In fact, this Because apparently we've all got to avoid eye contact either that right, or facial expression. I'm going to use it the night before, if you've a minute And all , don't believe it. Yes That's two there isn't it? Yes I've got, they're reading about I. The manager, what's the manager going to do, do you think? Give directions. And the observer's just going to watch the group as a whole because she's not anybody to, to . How much longer do you think? . How about sitting here Deena? Unsure, don't know. Do you think we're going somewhere this week? Nip up then because she probably . Perhaps they're doing pass the parcel like . You know that Piper Alpha thing? No , late at night,, they've got the boat, and the tape, they're both out on tape and video, and basically you have to go back, as soon as the boat comes through docks the next person picks it up and goes, so you've got very little time to pick up information , and all the time you can't go in, and the clock's going , and the clock's going and you switch , and they said it was , next to you, they said it such a Can you buy that then? Yes, it's about twenty pounds but it's X rated. Are we going to prepared to start that then, I'll say we started, I make it, I make it dead on twenty five to now, but if we go by that clock, and if everybody goes by that one it's probably easier, because that's between twenty five to, so if we make it about eighteen minutes past. No but if it's like, not been part of Alright, so do you want to start now. Right as you know I'm the head of a major advertising company. We've been approached by er, the local county who wish to er, make up some radio from the er agency. , surprise, surprise. Okay. What, in order to decide whether they're going to give us the contract what they have asked us to do is prepare a thirty minute radio, sorry thirty second radio presentation and we will re , record for them and they will hear, which we want to emphasise based on how good that was whether they want to take the contract out with us. Okay, is everybody clear on that? Here's the , to go on. It can be anything real or imaginary. The only precondition we've got on that , is that it's got to be thirty seconds long, we can use whatever sound effects we like, we really, to begin with, we have got to have scripts, everybody here takes part in it has got to have a script first, Yes, now what I'm saying is I mean there's going to be, there's four of us, they're five of us here, taking part in the exercise, yes? So if four of us were to work on it as a group , Two of yous do the script together Right so are we, are we going to, do the script, is one person going to read it all out, or are we going to go round and? Let the manager decide. Fair enough, I shall read out the script . Yes, yes, maybe. So if we three start into that . National Children's Homes,, yes, founded in eighteen sixty nine, C H, children's health, and associated with children's charities, we work with, among others children with disabilities, sexually abused children, homeless young people,. Throughout England there are projects nationwide, they need practical support, counselling, and specialist treatment, but above all there are sixteen thousand children a year that hope for a better future. That's a better right, what I would suggest, is somebody take , what I was going to say is if you time me reading this, okay we get an idea of how long exactly we need to make . Founded in eighteen sixty nine, N C H , is Britain's second largest children's charity. We work with among others, children with disabilities, sexually abused children, homeless young people, and . Through our two hundred projects nationwide we give practical support, counselling, and specialist treatment, but above all we give sixteen thousand children a year the hope for a better future. Please support us in our year, N C H, a charity for children . What, what ideas are need getting across, how, what, what the charity does, how the er, how the charity does it, and how we can help. That's three priorities in that order. So I think first of all we need to, need to introduce what the charity is and who, who they're going to be benefitting. I think we'll along with a . Well we don't have an idea on this. No. What does it say in the advert? You said it Who we worked for, so that you introduce the charity, who we work for erm, Right, well what did that, question one what charity d , what the charity does right. Yes, okay, anything like that, caring, caring for children, helping children Not really no,so what we're doing now, we don't want to get too carried away with one, one title, we've got to try and find things to say how we're going to achieve it. We, we've got the how you can help section here, but we've got nothing at all about what the charity does and how it does it, yes we need some appropriate words for getting the idea that they're helping children. yes, then there's the , yes, what that says, at the top, so you can announce what the aim of the campaign is. Can we get help , for the best possible start, we want , something like that, so we're saying, help us to do this, that's how we're getting across the idea they're erm, how they're going about it. Erm, you could say worse, I suppose you could cheat, but erm, Okay I want,, research, help us, erm, help erm, help us give something like that, help us give a best possible start to them, help us give them, to help us, to them, Okay time is up. You can stop now please. Okay then, , , and all the jokes and chuck all your scraps away first. Where's the bin? Are you alright there? Right so what we'll do first of all is get you to your results, and then as each end , we'll get the observers to make their comments. So who wants to go first? I think we'll go first if you like. Yes,, you may as well stay there if you like or you can come down or , Set time. I am I am Julias Denton for homes for the children's charity. Our aim is to build one hundred new homes for our homeless children. Children are all our responsibilities, please support the children's, The kids, , home,. Right, very good, thank you. Phil, you're next. Okay. Go on then. End of Side One. , Shall I bring it down here then, bring it over to there and Yesterday, ten thousand children were killed. Richard Branson saved us over the boredom. Just to survive we need your cash today. Our trip is vital for charity. Please support us on the hot-line , in hope. Mm, thank you, it's very nice. Oh, I'm not too sure, We're the National Children's Home, Action for Children. There is way you can help improve research, we need to give the best possible start to kids. If you care to help rescue children with disabilities and teenagers who suffer abuse we want you to say yes, and to help get eight hundred million pounds Phone now on , with your credit card or visa, or contact your nearest National Westminster Bank. Very good. yes, thank you very much. , They were all very good. Okay then, which observer wants to observe or come out with I don't mind. Okay then, Hannah, what, what happened in your group? Right, do you want me to go through every point? Well erm, Erm, we had a , A couple of tears and so on Yes, go through the first five minutes, there were all different tasks, erm, at first, the girls were making up a basic jingle that would be about thirty seconds, and everyone else was looking through to see what words they should use. And Tracy had already, no, they'd all decided what charity it'd be, Tracy asked what they suggested, so she's democratic. Erm, they all suggested that it should be something like famine. And then they started looking for words that might be relevant so that's quite good. Erm,they put the bit of paper in the middle with the suggestion type of thing that they were , and then they all looked for words, erm,then Ian and Deborah arranged the words on the paper to start ar , rearranging the jingle so that the words that they had, they used their resources like that, and anything else. Tracy was keeping an eye on the time all the time, they didn't rehearse it , none at all. Was that because of lack of time? Yes. At first they were very calm and at the end, at the end there was a big panic that they was, they were all talking over each other, there was no control, you know, it was a bit rushed at the end, but, that wasn't because it was bad planning, it was just they were panicked at the end. It was more difficult than we thought. They should have had more definite targets, because it was a bit, everyone, at one point everyone was doing the same thing,, through the words which Why was that? Pardon? Why was that, was that because it ? Because it, it's terrifying looking at a blank piece of paper when we needed ways to start the comment. yes So we had to get some ways to try and get something down. They all had an input, and Tracy kept them a lot. Erm, as I say, she's like, she's very democratic, and she's always asking them what they felt how, how they felt they should tackle it, I mean They hadn't decided what the message should be Overall, if you had to comment, how do you think it went? It was good, apart from the end. And then there was panic because there was no time in the end. Thank you very much that group. Next group,, okay, Erm, I came down and explained what the nature was, what you wanted to be done, you didn't really explain why and how important that our was, which I felt , that he said what he needing doing, he said what resources he had, and he said that, he didn't really set tasks erm, but he did ask them what they thought they should do you know. Erm, That's good. Sorry? That's what I was going to say. Yes, you set tasks, but by erm, Dave, not by Ian. Erm, at the start it was a bit higgledy-piggly, they didn't really know what they was doing, I felt anyway. And they didn't really decide on what the message was going to be, erm, they just decided to start checking lines, getting words out on what the charity was going to be, they split that up quite well. Erm, I felt that that Tony was getting a bit frustrated It was There was no Yes, I stopped, like. There was no teamwork really to start with. He was getting a bit frustrated, they didn't really know what they were supposed to be doing. Towards the end it got better though, and they got the time right, we timed it towards the end and the wording was right, so it got better towards the end. Okay Erm,yes, and that was it really, at first the , and then it went through, and it was alright at the end. So it was Yes, it was quite bad to start with, quite poor teamwork, and there was no That's what, that's how I felt was happening. We were given tasks, but then the tasks had been given to certain people like yourself, starting to want to do the other things, that other people were doing, and then everybody wanted to do instead of doing the tasks that they were set. Yes, that's what I mean. There was quite a lot pressure and half the team weren't listening to what Ian was saying at that so Alright so, there was a bit of competition between Nobody , at the end When we asked for a script from that side from the beginning, it didn't come. Well no because we hadn't , us, given us any ideas, towards the end it got better, and they were. Towards the end it got better and they worked, it was a bad start, but it got better towards the end. And we actually got all the words out. We got the words up there and timed it right and everything and then a rehearsal was done. Okay, okay, thank you very much. It was very confusing,key words, when we started using key words and when we asked because something wasn't there, and we consulted the script, we were still cutting words out, but, at, the script was definite, but sort of like, two of them well they had doubts, and like we started cutting words out, and then like, the words that were out . Ian started on the script , there were some use of that to begin with, the key words a lot, maybe got stuck on the piece of paper because Maybe not according to, We're all pulling together. What about your team Terry? I think you, you're Er, right, everybody seemed , and getting it follow it by, erm, the first stage of the planning, erm, did the manager clearly understand the nature of the situation? Erm, I feel that she'd read the brief but hadn't studied it, because she, she went back to half way through, and er, looked at the objectives. Erm, she established the objective, not autocratically, but democratically, erm, there were all sorts, the resources available,what we have, yes, that's not a problem, but the, at the same time, the rest of the group went to establishing the objective, and there was a lot of over-talking by people, and I feel that she didn't control it and say, look this is what we're going to do now. Then we didn't achieve, we're didn't produce a work plan or organiser, we went straight in, people were hacking out bits of papers, you know, it ended up as a big pile of words you know. So,, he took on the task of er, writing the script off his own bat, he wasn't appointed to it, er, but he stuck with that throughout, and erm, he stuck to his objective. Erm, he organised the coordinating, after a while she did actually stop them after five minutes and explain the time situation, er, the final objective were the constraints. There was no really interaction on that on anybody's part. Er, nobody looked at the time which, which did cause a problem. yes, we did You were looking at the time, but it didn't come up, I mean. We did yes, we mentioned it, I mentioned. Yes, you mentioned it a couple of times, put there was no-one really keeping a watch on the clock. Not, not that I saw. Can I? , , there's eleven minutes to go, and literally everyone starts panicking. You know everyone's like , , It says it really doesn't it? , Alright then, moving on, moving totally on. Yes, er. Alternate feedback. Yes, but not on an on-going basis. It happened a couple of times,, the exercise. If puzzled. Okay, well I did try to motivate them, motivate them to make the most of each person's individual skills. Er, people chose what they wanted to do. Erm, I cheated. Shit, look Joe, you speak to her, you sit and talking across her,, she's talking to Sharon, you know that, that's all the way through it Come on,, alright, alright. I love you too. Erm, Come on Gary. Erm, good point, she did er, give them letters and she told other people to contribute, she erm, she at one stage ask everybody what they, what the record was. Er, the main problem was the time constraint. There was five minutes to go, Right. And we're still, you know, fighting about changing the script and what have you. But they, they did come up with the work on the results, and then they, they did get time to plan it. Right. And they rehearsed it as well. Er, although Shirley, she took over the ro , erm, she took the role half way through of down on the floor splitting things up things over, er, the rest of them were cutting out words and what have you, and writing out the script the way they wanted it, and she just stuck them on the floor,, and they changed the script, so in that respect she was They changed the script once Yes, no, I mean It depends how you , , ah no, but you, but you weren't aware of that because you were on the floor, as I was saying five minutes ago. , I don't want all that over here. Erm, I mean, all in all they did, they did get the final result, the scene came together right from the last eleven minutes to achieve the result, but it was just there was a lot of confusion at the beginning of the start. Right, okay, well thanks very much, if you'd like to get tables back , Is there a pair of scissors anywhere? A pair of scissors? yes. Well quite an interesting exercise I think? , I hope you're not , well several interesting things have come out of there, it just shows the sort of thing about working under pressure, and the limited amount of time, erm, the limited amount of planning time for the managers certainly. Erm, if the man , who were the managers? Ian, you were one,, and Tracy, if you could just say a few words. What did you find were the difficulties and how did it go really? Erm, I thought mine, when I came back and I briefed everybody so that they all knew what was going on Yes Erm, then I think it probably had us confused for a while, whilst we were just trying to decide who should do writing and who should do what, but then I decided I'd chose two people, and then we started cutting things out so then that, that went okay then. Erm, then we all just worked at getting pieces out on paper, all that was going fine, and then I assigned two more people to stick all the pieces together and trying to create sentences from it, and I think the only time that I, we lost it was like, right at the end we were like looking for a few words to make our sentences make sense. And so we were panicking a bit, because we were just trying to get there, but apart from that, I think it went okay. Like we, we didn't have any arguments amongst the group, I mean I was, everybody was quite willing to do everything, everybody was helpful, came up with suggestions. So it was okay. Okay, what about you Ian? No, no go on. What did you think, we actually got on very well, I mean I thought we worked quite well together as a team. We did, yes. yes We erm, given that you have to do, okay, I didn't brief them as fully as I could of, and half way through I looked at it again just to make sure I hadn't missed the bottom line that said, you know stand on your head instead in the park, so I just had a little read. And we made within two minutes to sort out what we were going to, or we decided what charity first, then we decided two would decide on the script while the others cut out relevant pieces that we thought might be useful words. And then when the sc , we had a look at the script and we changed it a little bit, and then we all went, they were cutting out words, so we were doing, the first few all three ways, and we'd look and say, okay, so it was a scrambled mess as we all looked through for three words and ended up with , and I got down on the floor, so we knew where we were. And then we changed things like the name because we found somebody's name in all these words, somebody , and we just sellotaped it down, and at the end when we were running out of time, and we did about three times have a look at the time, we did change the script slightly to fit the words that we'd found so we had responsibilities instead of, I don't know what it was, but instead of another words, just because we'd found it. And we just changed it again. But once I think we were, we were going in a mad rush er, each saw his responsibilities for that word, and that'll do, and then we'd say yes, and stuck it here. In terms of managing the time, did you feel it worked quite well? yes, I mean we got the end result, Yes Okay we changed a few words just to fit the words we could find, but yes, we, we had about a minute at the end, we read it through, and yes, it was fine. I thought we worked alright together. Okay. Sorry, can I just make one small comment on that? Pardon? Can I just , You, you did actually, again it's the time thing, yes. Originally you weren't really looking at it, five of you all fell into the same trap, you know, they, they get half way through, and they did have something to do and they did sort of start rushing. , Okay then, let's leave that there, and then talked about that at tea, and you can have a talk about it then. Come on Ian. Well I have to admit, with our group, the first ten minutes or was a little bit disorganised because I felt we, I came in, we set down the objects, I felt we did that well, and we were clear of the timescale from the very beginning. We decided quite soon which charity we were going to go for, and we divided up. I mean, I had Tony to go through and find key words that we knew we were going to need, you know, simple words like the, of, with, a, that sort of thing, that we knew that okay, we wouldn't use immediately, but we'd look, ah there that goes there, and use it straight away. Erm, we set tasks that erm, two people were supposed to be working on the script while two people looked through the paper. Now I think what te , what happened there was we er, we drifted away from setting down sc , er, er, scripts to finding good useful key words and phrases out of the paper that we could then fit into the script, and as it had gone that way, I realised it was working, and didn't see any point in trying to get it back to the way it was originally going, because it was going fine. Erm, we had an example advert early on that we actually read through, for the simple reason of finding how long it was going to take, so we had a target as to how long we needed the advert to be very early on and we could work to that. Erm, we carried on, er, it got better as it went on. Tony wasn't impressed a little bit, but a little, a little gee up and we were away again. Erm, I felt that er, we had plenty of time at the end, I mean we, we tried only three times to get it right, and it was okay, and I felt we worked well as a team in that amount of time. Alright well, generally then I think from hearing what you're saying, erm, some good points, some perhaps things that you'd do differently next time, and then what it obviously says about you is that, you're all managers and you all have different styles, and you possibly do things in different ways. And you've been in a scenario where there's one manager and there's a few people who aren't in a managing role, but you are actually managers , maybe they'd like a little reversal, I mean, I think some good things have come out of that, and possibly things that you'd do better next time. We all achieved the target Yes, you all did really well . Yes, thank you Stephen. Yes, perhaps you'd We all achieved the end result. Everyone's just trying the same situation. And they thought Yes, patches of chaos, possibly in the disorganisation, but you got there in the end. Erm, I think what we'll do now is have a quick cup of tea, a nice friendly, smiley , cup of tea, And then I want you to meet, I want you to be back here by quarter to four. It's called time , it gives you a little space at the top so you can fill in what you feel to be your role, and if you can fill below, all the tasks in respective order that you do in a typical day. Right, so a complete brainstorm, and we'll start again, and we'll come back to those in a little while. We're going to spend the rest of the session on time management. We're going to talk about three methods of managing your time. The first of those is delegation, a much talked about subject. Erm, how many of you delegate? Yes Yes, the vast majority? How do you go about that, and what sort of things do you delegate? I look at all the jobs that's got, that have to be done in the day, right, and look at which ones I should do, and then all the other jobs I just share out between the relevant people. Right, is there any kind of pattern to that, or is it on a daily basis that you do that? No, certain things, certain specific jobs are set to certain people. Such as? That are on-going. One of my, my senior section manager does till results, anything to do with till results, my section manager does scheduling. Another section manager does something else, and they do that every week. Okay, does that, and you find that that works well? Mm, very well. Er, what kind of checks to do have, do you have to keep on that? About once every week I'll check that everything's been done. Well, with the scheduling obviously it's checked every day, but erm, things like till results, I check every week to make sure it's been, if she's been, but she's really good so, so I just have to check up. What they did at a branch on our district erm, again it was just like set up, people were given specific tasks, but at the end of the three month cycle, they'd change some people, er, those people's tasks so that they, so they wouldn't get stagnant, and plus, if one person was off, if you happened to be on holiday, you've got somebody else that can do the job at the standard and not let the standard fall. So you're not just reliant on one person, and if that person's away you're stuck. Anybody else delegate? Delegates? I think everybody does throughout the course of the day without even realising anyway, do they? Certainly, the only go , the only way I run a shift , the way she runs checkouts, is erm, by going, you, it's the same thing every day, you've got to run through everything on the same point order, because you know, you've been doing it, it's got to be done at the same time, like bread the last lot's got to be on by four. Erm, so you, it's one of the second, third things to look at when I, I start at three fifteen, it's the third thing I do. The first thing I do is check the stocks, followed by date returns and er, you know, erm, get that done,out of the way, and start looking at the , of the night , and what have you, setting that up, and maybe the late night process, hand over from the branch manager, walk round doing any detail he wants me to do, and hand over from late nights. Department managers, new checkouts, do all the bits and pieces on , and wanted me to do, while I wait for the shift to come in, and they start at seven. Er, keep an eye on them, I'll have a bit of replenishment here and then, erm, so he's, until eight o'clock, and then you get everything pulled out. Erm, replenishment until ten o'clock, er, get the warehouse , get the clear-out underway. So where do you actually delegate within that? To the er, because there's no other management in the place, you just delegate to another member of staff. And is that er, do you have one person that you allocate specific tasks or do you go on a daily basis. Er, it's like, it's like the foreman on the shopfloor for some reason, there's a er, in the systems or whatever, er, the warehouseman er, the night porter er, when he takes over, he knows what he's doing, he knows what I want, because I've spoken to him about it, erm, he knows what items I want to leave for stock people, erm, and Sue, the checkout manager, she'll know if I want extra people on the shopfloor because we're quiet, or I expect it to be quiet, erm, she knows where they've got to be, and I'll come back and review it with her. Okay, anybody else delegate? Yes, well how do you do it Teddy? Well it's, you go in in the morning, and it's the same jobs every day really basically. Erm, the , I first tell people what to do because they all know their roles, and when you go in in the morning, and you're just basically going round checking that they've already done it all. Okay Erm, if there's something needs doing extra you just ask the person who's best for the job to sort it out and to do it for you. So your role is more a checking and writing one, similar to what Helen. Yes, well with the staff I've got, yes, they're all there. At night-times I've got my jobs to get stuck into on the shopfloor as well, just hope that everybody works as a strong team basically. Yes, does anybody here not delegate? I did delegate, but I won't do it now, I do literally Say that again, I missed that. Er, I sorry,, just clearing my throat, er, I did, I did delegate if somebody put it on the end of somebody's assignment, then I to it, but I tend to find I underestimate what people can do for me all the time, and don't identify just how much those people can give me back, and I did, or I do have a tendency at times to give people like before, to hold on too much, try and do too much myself, and er, you can't do it that way in case. But once you've, you've got to know your people better, develop your people better. Right. It's something I've got to work on. To decide for yourself what they're capable of. Why, does anybody else find difficulty with delegating. No, I was just going to say that if, if you try it once, you know, you know if they can do it, they'll be . Oh, yes. I was going to say, I like to set somebody task as they're down for, and I look for it, and nine times out of ten you'll find out if they can achieve that very shortly, very fast. And if they cannae cope with it, they'll come to, or the majority will come and say look I cannae do it. If it's something silly, that they haven't been trained for, but most jobs you can delegate and they'll do it just as well as you. It's just a matter of having confidence in them to do that. Since, since Norwich, you just can't delegate like erm, you just ha , you don't have any other management there, only section managers, and you delegate that job to er, supervisors, erm, it's a very on-hands management situation. You can delegate to anybody can't you. You can delegate your staff as well. Yes, yes, fair enough, but erm, Depending on the task, it depends what the job is. Yes, I mean, like I mean making late payments, I'm delegating people to fill up those late payment. Okay, it's delegation, but it's not erm, the sort of like, a responsible job if you see what I mean, it's a job that they're employed to do anyway, but it's not a separate sort of task. Yes, okay. What's the difference between delegating and abdicating? Delegate erm, you can delegate the job, but you can't delegate the responsibility. Right, so when you delegate, what are you delegating? Specific tasks, the physical But when you delegate that task is there anything that you retain? The responsibility that it's being done right. Right, and who is ultimately accountable? Yourself. Yes, right, okay. When we're talking about delegating tasks, I think tasks can be almost categorised into two clear sections. Has anybody heard about how tasks can be categoried? I think they mentioned it on the video. Urgent and important. Right, then there's that which we're going to come onto in a minute It's active, isn't it, instead of reactive Reactive, yes. Can you erm, explain what a reactive task is, Tracy? It's something you haven't got planned into your day, isn't it, it's something that comes up, and you, you have to respond to it, so you have to have time between the day, to be able to do those things. Okay, can you give an example? Erm, it's like to keep my day planned out but, like the district manager might walk in or people might go off sick, and then you have to fill somebody in to that position. Things that you just don't think are going to happen So you act Especially management goes down ill or something. Okay, so they're unexpected can you thing of any, er, another kind of way of erm, other tasks that possibly could be described as reactive tasks? I've got customer experience. Pardon? Customer experience. So you've got customer query, or something like that. yes The bakery , and you're expecting a delivery, especially like on produce, and then you have to go off , or something like that, get people stacking right up. Okay, what about erm, if the opposite, I mean if we've got reactive tasks, what's the opposite of that? Proactive Proactive, or possibly just active. And how would you describe an active task? Something you do every day anyway. Right so they're regular, Regular, yes. What do they do for your department? I mean that, can you think of examples of active tasks? cleaning, checks Till checks, right, interesting that you should say that. Erm, just filling up shelves. yes, interesting you should say that, because the definition I had was something quite the reverse. Many of these are planned for, isn't it, you might do it every day, but you've planned for it, Right, So you, you'll be able to do it every Monday, but you've planned for it on Monday, you know who's going to do it, and they, you know, it's set up. Okay, so it's something right. The way I would possibly define active and reactive, I would see active as things that actually take your department forward a step. They are things that you do which actually improve your department both in the short and in the long-term. The long-term specifically. Things like okay, ordering possibly could be reactive and active, because yes, it's something that has to be done every day, but if your order in spot on, that is an active task, it would improve and benefit to your, you would say that that,. Whereas reactive, I think one typical task that's a reactive task which is yes, it's unexpected or whatever, is cardboard collecting, because it's the type of thing that happens regularly, but it doesn't actually get your department, it doesn't It doesn't achieve anything. No, in a day you do now, then later you've got to do it again. It's one of those mundane tasks. yes I mean, can you think of any, I mean, putting that kind of interpretation on it, can you think of anything else other than cardboard collecting. Tidying the cabinets, dressing them down . solids. Do you often find yourself doing these tasks? All day long. All day long, right. And most of the night. One, I think one of the tasks that you find branch managers doing on a fairly regular basis is collecting cardboard. What? Some of them do. My branch manager does it all the time. Yes, my branch manager does it all the time, yes, it's his regular way out. It's escapism. Escapism, exactly, you've hit the nail on the head there Dee, escapism. It's a comfort blanket, that's what it is, when you see your branch manager collecting cardboard, it's usually because he's feeling a bit stressed out. No, it's just because he's lazy. It could be just because he's lazy. Alright, what about, when you mentioned as well, we've got reactive and we've got active tasks. What about, you said something about, somebody mentioned important and urgent tasks? Who said that? I did. Yes, what do you see as those being? Well urgent tasks would be tasks that are done at that time, to complete them. So urgent equals time Equals time limit. limit and I mean, urgent is now isn't it, Yes It's to be done A S A P. What about important? Important, it has to be done, but it's not as, it's not as important as the urgent. Is that, is that right, what do the rest of think? No, it needs to be done but it's something that It needs to be done but do you know what I mean, if you don't your important things on time they become urgent yes, yes. No, because things come up unexpectedly, so things will become urgent that maybe you didn't think were important, but have just suddenly emerged. Do you know what I mean? Unexpected things that emerging you have to do there and then, like The whole day's important isn't it? The whole day's important. Yes, everything, a lot of things are important, and what you're saying is true Alex, that if you do the important things when you should do them, they won't become urgent, but equally what Tracy says is that, is true is that you will get unexpected things cropping up where you have to drop everything. I tell what is urgent is a message coming down to you, you've had a delivery team, they're going to destroy cases of whatever, so that's urgent, that has to be done there and then because it's a danger to the public or whatever. So that's important. And then you've got emergencies. How long, I mean, how, in terms of, in terms of time that you spend on urgent or important tasks, how long do you think an urgent task may take? Not long, not very long. So it's relatively short? And what about important? You might take your time on that, more time. So it could be something that's rather time consuming? Can things be both urgent and important. What can you think of that possibly is? Well your could be important first thing in the morning today, as you're sidetracked into doing other things, then it becomes urgent doesn't it, if you've had to reposition your , and whatever. Right. What I'd like you to do, is to have a look at your time , one, and first of all see notes down on it, make a note beside each task that you've got on there, whether it's active or reactive. Bearing in mind that active are things that take your time forward, in the long-term, reactive are things like scale checks, you know you're daily, fairly monotonous tasks like that. Aren't some, some of them both? Sorry? Aren't some of them both? Er, that's a possibility yes? You know you could say these scale checks, they're , but they're still urgent to be done. The, they're still, they're, they're not active in that they don't actually progress your department do they? If your scales are wrong you're not progressing are you? No, but we're not, we're not arguing that they're not working. Just classify them as being reactive and active, by them. Totally monotonous It tends to be the case that when a task is identified as being reactive you can usually delegate it down, because it's very, it's a monotonous, everyday task, it doesn't actually move the department forward. It's not strictly when, when there's a bargain going Mm, yeah We've got two little freezers we have Oh they've got a couple of erm these down the market don't they? Mm , I've never been there We went round it I often er Have you ever been to that Corby market?

I remember when Sue worked behind beard and that all the time and he shaved that off, oh My boss was telling me about some old boy right he had a beard for all his life yeah? yeah a really long beard right? yeah And one day he shave it off, it took his wife three hours to notice and it took his mum all day to notice I think that's terrible and he's always had it?

Yeah, lines yeah pulled it up to the shed and I've left it there I didn't know what to do about that, I put and they I know it's not in there unless it's under the but I doubt it Maybe I doubt it anyway Perhaps it's sold yeah they do, I they all love that there Right I give you it, it's the same old Could be I mean six months been out there Long time Yeah Yeah six months, not having no right may as well alright don't want them fix my Were they Thank you very much I'm tying up shoes, OK, do you want these Chewy? Finish all the lunch off. That's nice Yeah Oh Should think dear anything Some more I'm going upstairs to listen to some music How big were they? About two, some of them were about two foot some of them were about four How much were they each? Er twenty two pounds fift , er twenty two pounds fifty So, dear ain't it? Worked out less than, I don't know and they give us all the posters and everything, so weekend I'm gonna send away for another seventy No Yes, seriously You ain't got enough room in your garden Course I am that beginning of the extent or the end of the extent of the fish pond That's trying for them, twenty two inches apart There is a saying ain't they? Yeah, if you want a hedge six, if you want a hedge six foot high, a good solid hedge six foot high, plant eighteen inches apart, so I've had, I've planted them between twenty are four attainment targets, there are three attainment targets That's right. Yeah. they are these and tha You're obliged it's just the number of boxes that you're gonna change! Is everybody happy with that layout for that? Yes. Yeah! Ecstatic! Mm mm mm. Mm. Nearly. Go on Andrew. God ! We nearly go agreements! No, it's important! What time does this Erm session end by the way? Half three. I dunno,i is there no tea there? Half three. It's called We'll we'll have a Cup of tea! Hang on Angela! Half past three today. There's an awful lot of information that I've put in there which I've photocopied and much reduced from the official documents Mm. which gives a great deal more information about the attainment targets than the er, two or three words But ha they have got headings though haven't they? Yeah they have. I could have put the headings on as you have Mhm. and to take the whole bloody lot out! Ha! Right Oh!pages. you you , absolutely, we'd go on forever and ever and ever and er, therefore, I I, I withdraw all of that stuff but, in a way I feel that it would be helpful for parents, probably who haven't seen this information and might like maybe a sample You mean you would like to present it in a different way? some somewhere , yeah, maybe not on here Mm. not on each subject but, maybe on the inside cover of er, a presented re , er set of sheets but wha wha , you know, however it's gonna be sent or on the back of the summate sheet or something. You know, for your information the attainment targets have quite lengthy descriptions here are one or two examples, here's a maths one, here's an English one, here's a Mm. a science one, for instance because, I don't suppose many of the parents will have seen o all the thickness of the document will No. they? they they've only had the taster because I sent home the erm a map of of D O S, D E S whatever I'm supposed to call it now. D S E. D S E. D S E. D S E. I sent home the the that document in with the national curriculum's er report. Which S I've now lost! So in other words, some suggestion that these headings Are indicated more. have a lot more , yes Mm. indicator of of quite a rich scene and, that the That's a nice image. Yeah, thank you. Anyway, But you're in great danger there because you'll you will beco , it will come like this Yeah. and a parent will say, level four maths? No, multiplication tables find and average and know how to work out an area, that's a doddle! You know, I mean, there's an example of what they're saying. I think Level four, this is what you do in maths But that's only one bit of it isn't it? you know , and that is a little piece of maths and tha , I mean, that is absolute rubbish! It's only a very small part of level four. Because they they've condensed it and just put in a few little bits and pieces! Mm. So you're against that because you think it trivialises it? You cannot, you cannot give them the the national curriculum book! I think there's an element, Paul comment? I think we could all do what Andrew's suggesting quite easily er I could do it for Geography, erm, I just think it's making a lot of extra work. Garbage. Yeah. Mo more than it needs? Yeah. Can I just say then we seem to have agreed that that standard Andrew points been taken on board and dismissed out of hand No, I'm not cos I think it's quite a valid No I'm being point he's making I'm being mhm. Erm Don It's whether we've I know you carry a lot of valuable stuff in your briefcase. Can I borrow your briefcase? Mm. Thank you. Ca , can I make a point about the tick now? Mm. Since we're at that point. I put that inversely i i he's put down inversely fro from what we will we are obliged to do we're obliged to say that these levels ha er have been erm have not been checked by SATS Mhm. if they have been Mm. but I thought to th this way it was Mhm. you know,we we're obliged to put that little bit in you know, there's year seven, year eight, year ten the there won't be a tick in there and so the the these levels will be whatever you've decided they are in the way that you asses but at the end of the key stage this report will go out in Au i in September now following SATS. Mm. Or it'll go out in July God knows how we're gonna do it after SATS in er a a ye at year fourteen. So we've got to have that statement in and we've got to differentiate it some way or from the But if you had your name and year at the top you could actually put a simple statement along the bottom because you'll only be issuing it for year nine And eleven. well, will you because year eleven is automatically confirmed by levels G C S E. at G C, G C S E? But it is end of key stage four. But we will have a record of achievement, this system will not be used for years Mm. year eleven, will it? So we wouldn't need it, so all I'm saying is you could put in one simple statement at the bottom, year nine de dun de dun de dun and will confirmed by SATS external test. This will not be used at er end of key stage four or something? Well you use this reporting system in year ten but year eleven We'll have record of achievement. you'll have a record of achievement and prob this this yo you'll have your own format, your amended format but aren't we obliged to to produce this erm, in September. September Mm. of of of the Yeah. Following year, yeah. end of that key stage four? Yes, but it will be it will be this bit of it that you know, the bit that comes Right. from the from the boards that we'll get, cos there'll be thousands and thousands of bloody numbers! Oh! That, that you're gonna send out to parents, they're gonna look at all these numbers and oh The end of key stage form can be different, different format. Mm. That Mm. the the bits of that tie into Let's wait to, wait till Yeah wait. the thing arrives before we Mhm. So what I'm saying is this will appropriate for year seven, eight, nine and ten We're obliged to and a say sorry! Go on Right. Don. We're obliged What's that to say that if er, it is not a SAT year, we are obliged to say these levels have not been confirmed by SATs so the only in year nine we, we don't need to say that. But I think i it also would highlight if you put it as a sentence Right, fair enough. that rather we kept it in. for year seven, eight parents it is coming, if you like, that at the end of year nine it's the end of the key stage and it's an important time de dun da, they're warned for two successive years. I know it seems a little bit i idealistic, don't know what the word is I want but it is for warning that what's happening that the end of ninth year is an important time in terms of er er measuring er their pupils er relative success. So I'm suggesting that that, we could take that box out er er and this be re-phrased as a sentence, either at the top So, or underneath I don't mind which. Okay? How about this then, these levels have not been confirmed by SATS except in the year nine report? Well, I I don't think you need the first No I don't. part in. No. It's negative. well indi individual levels will be confirmed by external tests For year nine pupils these levels will be confirmed by When do they get the results for SATS? SATS. Don? Mm? When do they get the results for SATS? July. So You mark them yourself. right, okay. Send a report in don't you? Cos we've gotta report on year nine at the en , in before Mm. September or sorry, in July or Mm. immediately we come back, which is something else we have to sort out with our heads now. The end of August I think it is in, which means then in July doesn't it? Mm. For year, so the sentence will be Don, for year nine pupils er, these levels er what did you put? Have been confirmed by SA Will have been future perfect. And yo and you wouldn't be indicating that that's end of key stage three? You didn't put it there! Well for, you know,the these levels will have been confirmed by external tests. What about year nine? It goes year nine pupil I think you've gotta put SATS in, sorry. The levels of year nine Alright, external test bracket SATS! Right? You're an awkward bugger you! That's another technical term! Yo you didn't put will have been confirmed in there but you want it in there now and then you put SATS bracket external test,extern , I can't even say it, and now you wanna put external test bracket SATS! He's tired! He's gorgeous! There's another technical term. Right, so we don't want that one, we want this one? Have been confirmed by SATS. They've been confirmed ! Been confirmed by SATS ! Okay. Would you not be indicating end of key stage three somehow? Or do the does everybody Alright, for year nine pupils brackets, end of key stage three. Yeah. Okay? It's important these categories are set set out for us. Mm So Er so we don't want this box any more then? So What about this then? This box Yes can disappear? That box will go and you'll have name and year That's home. spread out more across No, I've put report down there. I've put report down there, cos then you have science, report math's, report and I put Ralph Gardener Community High School cos then I need space for community. I would put Ralph Gardener Community High School report on the heading, I would put name, year and your subject there or, subject whatever I would tighten that up Right. a bit. Mm. I think that that The lettering will be thinner needs to stand, it's awful! Mm. Ralph Gardener High School, Community High School It's a needs to be, in my opinion, on it's own above the rest. Report Mm. Andrew's a a little bit better on layout than me and I'm What yo you want Ralph Gardener High Scho , Community High School by itself? I bi I just thought it was Where do you want report then? Well Ralph Gardener Community High School hyphen report. Have I got space you see? Will that not go on Community School. the top? Don't see why not. I'm going back a step but I think it's What do you mean? important. You're gonna tr er, well no nothing else will fit in that page but no eno not the package that you use Ralph Gardener Community High School report. Well we won't necessarily be using your package for doing this. Mhm. Fine! Right, you use yours cos I'm not there! who whose gonna do it then? Well I vote you! I'm I'm I was gonna come to, Andrew's made an offer but volunteered a long Right. time ago. that might, might er er erm it's we can be your system , what I'm saying is Is it yours? . Don't even know where it is! Oh Terry you mean. Oh no, just That's alright sitting outside the kitchen. Ah! Those two A yes or a no? It's It's tonight's supper! Does Ralph Gardener Community High School hyphen report is the heading at the top. Mm. Yes? Mhm. Okay. Then below it you would have da da, year and somehow the subject fitted in on a line across, below it? So you'd have What for? name, year and subject would go in there in that box that's been left free. Do we agree that it should be big like that? I think it, I I like the Yeah! idea of it Yeah. the su the subject Yes. stands out. Yeah, that's right . Er, do you want the subject er, lettering the size as that? This was Andrew's No, I I I would like I'll sort that out. Yeah. I like it like this. I I think probably we'll be in a situation where Andrew will do a knock up Well I think we need it smaller . there will be several formats that we can agree on at a later date. Nice and big. wallpaper Paul? Yep. Lovely jubbly! Thank you very much, we've knocked that on the head. General skills and abilities we're down to now. Which is gonna be a debatable one I would of thought. Can we agree er the layout? Ten point scale Yeah. poor, satisfactory and excellent, scale and ability what we need to agree on is the skills and abilities that we want in there. Would you use excellent rather than good. Well no ten, level ten is bloody good! Excellent , yeah. Okay right, bloody good then, okay! Right, bloody good ! And can we have crap instead of poor? Yeah. Crap, crap and bloody good, yes and er middling! Why do you always have poor? Weak? I want to convey that meaning but I would rather not use that word. It is poor. Yes, I know but we're sensitive I've seen some words we we Not me! I would really call spade On on the ten point scale Alan a spade! wha what's written? Is there not something, not poor something written ha, not W ! Working towards ! You can't be working towards there! No the I tell you what Andrew's saying about poor Weak doesn't fit in. No. Doesn't fit in, how do you mean? Doesn't fit in with satisfactory and excellent. Mm, no. No, it's gotta be poor. Aye. Now hang on Pathetic! Crap! Shit ! ! The boy is shit ! Altogether, mm. Un un unsatisfactory instead of poor Oh ! Oh! another word instead of satisfactory. Safe. Oh! Aye, we're going back to The norm making fair progress now aren't we ? Yes, that's right, yes. He's making fair progress. One in two, one in two ! ! There's in somewhere. I'd like to think of something. Let's think of something. Hey, come on let's cause , one, level one and two are national curriculum scales for somebody in our school is poor! There's no value in it, don't start it off in that position as though there's an integral in it, all the Longman's Dictionary of all the same! Life's a little bit more complex than that Is it Longmans? Is that a Longman's one? that's merely an over-view. Yes it's Longmans! Is that a Longmans dictionary? It certainly is. That I see before me? Could I call for Massination , a plan for doing harm. Can, can we leave that word alone for for a moment cos I think it's a bit of red herring er, to some degree. Pretty awful! It will stand unless er somebody can come forward with a very positive suggestion the mind's ! blank at the moment. How about pretty awful and pretty Can ! Can can, can we look at the skills and abilities? Yes sir. Cos you know this list is as good or as bad you want to make it. Erm effort we have that in probably Yes. everybody accept Mhm. effort? There yeah. Mhm. Angela? Yep, that's fine, mm. Yeah? Er we don't have concentration at the moment erm, I'm not sure Question mark. Does that fit Yes I'm not sure about that. what we mean by concentration er, myself. Mm. Actually Ju I made them up just in the spur of the moment. Well that's fine! Mm. That's no no sweat. Sorry I haven't Behaviour? it up. Yep. Yeah. Mhm. Yes . Er I wrote following instructions because I wanted to somehow or other impart the ability to actually er, do something other than just er, to do something on their own, you know to actually work on their own. Ability to actually do something rather than just copy something to follow instructions means they've got to actually do a ste step-wise thing. Right? Yeah we I must admit, would a, would a parent, I mean I was at a very simple level, following instructions, go and get that ruler Jimmy? Aha. In other words you know i in a sense vidable Do doing as doing as Vidable. they're told! Yes. Yes. Mm. Doing as they're told. Mm. Yeah. I I know what you're saying and it's different to the way I'm interpreting it. That's it, we need to follow a set of step lies, instructions becoming more difficult as you go on that what was intended. But you don't want to give the impression that our children are not . That's the old one. Mm. Yes, active right, okay. Involvement. It must be there cos it's Involvement. underneath that Longman's Alright. dictionary look. Right. What about, what do you want Paul, sorry? Sorry, can I some of the old can have some Oh they're there yeah. Yeah, I'm . What about a word like involvement? The other thing Don is what are the gen , what are the the erm skills and abilities, you see there is a mathematical theme, what are the, literacy, we're supposed Yeah, we've got, yeah that to be addressing those. yeah that's got to go in there I think. Have you got to say mathematical skills? No. No. No. I can't remember what that one is. I don't think Aye not subject I think, I think a specific I think, yes, no I ju No there No are general skills Yes. there are six or seven Mm. they're in the bottom of mind they've gone completely! But would we not be calling Yes, and I can't remember it numeracy rather than mathematical Yes. skills? Alright. Alright,no no if you say numeracy then they'll know what it means but erm I fe I felt that numeracy and mathematical skills would not be applicable to all, I mean, I don't think it might No. be applicable to you, but Right, right sorry! ? Okay! Er, it might not be applicable to talents or erm hand spans or things like that but I certainly would want to include it, it might be very important in, in my subject. And I would like to be able to include it. Er, I think we would, oh! See, I think we're obliged to to now say something about erm these general skills, I think in light of what's been said in the last couple of weeks Mm. there should also be in there something like grammar and spelling. No, I totally disagree with that! And certainly not in the light of what's been said in the last couple of weeks that's Why? extremely questionable! What are the hell are they What What is that? The I mean if we're gonna discuss that that needs to be, you need to go over that in more detail. Is is is is there not an element that hinges round orally to do with the Yes. ability to orally speak? yes er, and literacy that's something different. Mm. Oh come on now! I mean the government is pushing er spelling a as as something which is very important spelling is going to be part of all course work as well as all examinations now! I'm not denying that. Well therefore, it's important to everybody! I'm not denying that. Therefore we better comment on it! Well, no what I'm, what I'm denying is I'm questioning your assertion on what's been happening in the last couple of weeks that we should react to that on a pa on er er report that hasn't been released, right? That's been partially responded to some people suspect for political reasons and rushing to that on report and I think we need to consider that in a more way. But don't you think that spelling is important for everybody to ? Of course I do! I think spelling's Well why not ? important. Angela I seem to rem The wrong one. remember that just a few weeks ago that you were de , almost denying that we'd have to do this sort of thing! What? Do you, a few weeks ago? Yeah, actually at the end of, end of I can't remember saying saying you last term yeah. Oh! When Don first actually broached this whole thing. No,a no With all due respect is tha is that re is that relevant? No, hang on here misrepresenting what I'm saying there. No, all I'm saying is that I'd like to support Don and what Don's just said there and I think that er, we a that is what we are gonna have to do. It might not be, be down as black and white But, no wait a minute cos they're two issues! at the moment. I , no, those are two i issues. Mm. First of all you're misrepresenting what I'm saying about those figures Mm. right? And, whether you believe that or not that is not effecting what I'm saying today and whether it's accurate or not! That's right! I I agree with you that those are concerns but I would not like things like grammar to be isolated out from other language skills No, not grammar but but basically, maths and English are the tools that the other subjects Oh yes, I agree with you. are are are working Could with. Could we work under a more general, how would you feel about if we put something down like, I dunno, written work would, is is that I've got written work. Does that not writing and neatness. Writing and neatness , no spelling is a , to my mind, spelling is important. Of course it is, I'm not denying that! Are I I to you repeating yourself? No. If we put, what about orally and literacy? And that includes all. We are obliged, I'll say it again No, we're not we obliged! We are obliged now to write G C S E? to to to re to report on, er in all course work to take five percent of our Yeah. er That's right. course work and base ma ma ma er do do something along the lines of spelling. Sorry, I'm not putting it very well. Yes, but that's assessed in English underneath the attainment target of writing. No, it's a separate ! But we're obliged every subject! That but anyway that doesn't ha hang on that that doesn't approve what you're saying, what I'm saying as far as English is concerned that's assessed underneath the attainment target writing Mhm. what I'm concerned about is put things down like that, er like that it encourages erm an appreciation of language skills that are bitty, partial, they can be pulled apart and it's not the model of language teaching that I would like to promote. Right. I'm not saying that spelling Mm. isn't important, obviously as an English Mm. teacher I'm not going to argue that but what I'm saying is that in this report I don't think that's necessarily the appropriate format. Well how am I going to report to parents our spelling ? Well reporting them un underneath the writ li literacy that is, that it's a literacy skill! But I think it's a bit more specific than that isn't it? Right. If they don't, if they can't spell they're not literate! And if they can't write in sentences they're not literate! So you would just put in something for literacy? So Well what I'm sugge , but as an alternative I'm suggesting that as far as that's concerned you put down Well we No, I don't think most of parents would have a clue what you're talking about! I'm sorry! Don't you? No. But we've Don't apologise! But but you haven't argued with that mathematical innumeracy and I think it's a comparable situation! Is it not? Yes, well I I would object to I'm not su somebody talking about mathematical skills. I think we're saying the same thing. Mhm. I'm trying to take an overview Yeah, yeah. I think Angela's saying exactly the same I'm trying to take an over-view. that Alan's saying and I think we'll have to respect that with all du Mhm. with all due respect. Ah, but at the same time we don't have to comment on mathematical skills at G C S E. No. No, but the ar , the previous argument was whether there would be an un sa understanding of it, we won't understand literacy. I think we have to recognise Angela's concern if er a subject area that she's trying to present, present and she is not precluding you from doing what you've got Oh no ! to do, she's just offering a different way of doing it. If you like, a different heading under which to do it. Well So she would put wha in you would put in what, sorry? Just literacy. I would put literacy. Because it involves more things. No no I disagree with that. Yeah, I disagree, I think I would still like to put Yep. spelling grammar punctuation Yeah but whatever. but these Is that not all part of literacy? Yeah. If, you see if you put down literacy the the whole show's in there, I mean if you're going to put i , put isolated spelling it i it encourages a very limited view of what English is about and success in using language. It's nothing to do Angela? with English! At that Oh! Andrew, comment That's on that? course it is, it's language is a I mean,a you sit outside it I medium of learning! any axe to grind? , it's not English subject area I'm talking about. Erm yeah, the the the axe to to to grind is is yes, I pick up the the the political stick here er, that was you know, that that, you know from the other the other end to you and yeah, yes I also think we're being beaten with a with a with a stick here for three R's er, if we're forced into the corner of having to use an ignorant white hall idiots er Inadequately educated. inadequately educated persons er, view of what it is to be well educated i.e. we've got to comment on the spelling as if it were important But I think it is. I think it is, yeah! ah, in the way that they I agree with what they're saying! in the way that they're saying it I agree with it, I in the way that they're saying it Mm. then no. But if as educationalists taking full account the subject specialism and our own knowledge of it, we would care to make some comment then that is a different thing altogether. Mhm. So that if we deal with it er er in a way that we can find a professionally acceptable Mm. then I think that we ought to comment on it but if we are doing media response Mm. then I don't think that we ought to go along with, for instance , just using a term like, spelling to Mm. summarise It's something which it's more complex. is more complex than that. Yeah. that's my I'm not saying it isn't important Professionally, if we did that we'd be cheapening ourselves. I I I think Absolutely! with all due respect here we have to respect the wishe , Angela's wishes, er, I mean, on the one hand we're respecting Alan's er er and I I No , I I'm gi it's not my, I I would just look at mathematical skills and saying that you're not really yo you don't really mean mathematical skills. I mean, for most of you Aha. yo you know, I mean i i i if Andrew were saying he's he's he's pretty limited at maths you wouldn't really be meaning limited in maths, you'd be meaning lim , limited in Certain skills. numeracy because Andrew wouldn't have been testing algebra or things like that, you'd have just been looking at the numbers. Oh! See Oh!. and that's what I'm saying. Mhm. So you're wanting a general Yes that doesn't exclude but includes all of that, but at the same time although everybody that's going to read it may not understand the intricacies of it all as professionals we're giving more than a passing nod, so that was something else, er er and something more involved than English teacher than making them jump through loops Mm. and cross t's and dot i's! But that,a a that's what I said If it's just a to you! No, if I may aye, I er, something's just occurred to me and we are looking we are looking, the other heading here of general skills and abilities.,. and se spelling Spelling is very specific. is specific. Mm. And on that basis I would But go along with literacy. Li literacy and And I think I'm I'm always inclined to do a Colin and say, you know Right. I've made my mind up and that's the way it's gonna be! I hate But doing things like that but I I I I believe quite strongly what Angela's saying er, if you came to me and presented something ba ba, a total er, conviction that it might be in a sense damaging er the er the the the concept people have of your subject, or might have I would listen very carefully to that, and I also ta , I remember Gordon saying some time ago and whilst Gordon drove me crackers he talked about the government saying you've gotta do this, you've go and he said there are things that we must believe in as educationalists ourselves, and professionalists I agree. ourselves despite what the governors Mhm. er, the government say to us. And I believe personally in this context it would be foolish, at the moment, to go down a narrow road until such time as we are ca Ah well, he'll tell you about that later. Erm obviously all the information here in the get up of this session is copyright . Now, the defences that we're involved in er are taking conveyance. Your client is alleged to have taken a conveyance . Erm, there's a possibility of dangerous driving as well. Let's look at document two. , is that your group? What would you say about document two? Document two . Right. Section four . Section four what? Twenty four. Sorry, twenty four, my mistake. Okay? What does section twenty four require? There's an additional That's not relevant here, is it? Yeah, I think there's some confusion here. Erm, in a civil case the rules of hearsay are basically of little importance because they can almost always be got round. For example, a person compiles a statement under a , that statement can be introduced under cross-section? Four Four. right? There is an equivalent section that relates to criminal evidence which allows a, a statement to be introduced but only where the needs, where the, I hate that word, the, where justice requires it to be introduced. And the purpose of that section is to prevent trials becoming paper trials where the prosecution do not call evidence. Now, they call evidence under a section nine, you, you can agree a section nine statement, prosecution statement, but you don't have to, right? And in this case you would not agree to statement being written, say being read out, you wouldn't require him to be present, and it could not be introduced under section twenty four because the court would find that it was in the interests of ju justice that it doesn't . Why is it in the interests of justice that ? Why shouldn't the case be conducted just on cross-examination, because of cross-examination? I mean criminal trials are oral trials where the evidence is given orally so that the witnesses can be cross- examined under a and be judged by the tribunal of fact. Okay?assume that a prosecution statements will be admissible in themselves and always assume that witnesses will give more evidence. Okay ? So will give evidence. If he doesn't want to give evidence that y , alright? So, assuming that he gives evidence any a evidential points ? You can't see whether you, you're acting for , what's your attitude to this statement? Anything in it you're not happy with? Right, what's the problem about that? So, sorry, what are you saying exactly? Where are we exactly? Are we at the in the statement? Pardon? Whereabouts are we in the statement? On the second page. Right, page eight. It was who took both cars, okay? Yeah Alright. You see what's happened there. That the police have got the witness to erm sign, initial, every line. That's not uncommon . Okey-dokey. What is the state of those statements? It was , he took both cars. Self-serving statements. It is indeed a self-serving statement statement, so, so what does that give us? If you were to characterize this, this interview, what would you call it? It's a text. By who? Part of the confession is a self-serving part, it's a er, possibly mixed statement. Er, in which he blames somebody else, okay? What is the effect of that? Against who? Against your client ? Yes? Do you agree with that? No. Why not? Right, the confession is only admissible against the maker. The statement implicating is not admissible against . Now, when the police officer when the police officer comes to court and goes through this statement, and it's a confession, what would you normally call what he's reading out? I heard say suppose I It's hearsay. But why does it have to be that? It's an exception to the hearsay rule. The confession is an exception to the hearsay rule. Okay? But it's an exception to the hearsay rule that only applies against the maker. Because it is something made against your own interest. Erm, the rule of evidence is that it is inherently unlikely that anybody would make a statement against their own interest unless it was true. Right? You might very well say that you were the greatest law lecturer in the world, because people tend to say these things about themselves. It would be unlikely that you would say that you were the worst law lecturer in the world unless you were. Okay?it's a statement against your own interest. This is a separate argument from whether you actually made the statement or not, or whether it was bullied out of you like in the case. But if you did genuinely make that statement it's more likely to be true if it's against your interest, rather than for your interest. Okay? If a double-glazing salesman tells you that his product is crap, believe him. Alright? Get worried if he tells you it's very good. Okay? Right. Because of that reason the confession is admissible against yourself as an admission, as an exception, to the hearsay rule. It is not admissible against the . Does that mean that the parts that are inadmissible are stuck out and you can give evidence only to the parts that are not self-serving? What do you think? What would be the point of the evidence if it's not implicating in trial? There's no point. The whole thing . Now, if the police think that this aspect of the case is important to them, how would they get the evidence in? Oral testimony of? , call . Okay? Can give evidence about trial? What other circumstances? Good. Yes. Relevant point. Here is, he's pleading guilty. What he's pleading guilty, he is competent to give evidence against . His evidence is then direct evidence. I saw do this. Okay? It is no longer hearsay. You no longer have to bring it within an exception. Yes? Not easy, this stuff. Not easy. Alright, now. I now want to go to back to the beginning of the statement. When you are dealing with statements, you must start off and go through it step by step and not leap ahead. Now, is there anything in the first paragraph that anybody thinks raises an evidential point? I think so. I can tell a race when I see one. Erm, I go to Silverstone to see races for two reasons. One, because they are advertised as that race and two, I see them dashing around the track. I think that's irrelevant. Okay? Anything else? First paragraph? Erm, yes. I can probably say I asked the driver for his . Yes I think cross-examine him. Are we happy about cross-examining, do you think? Yes? Great, yeah, that's cross- examining. . Yes? No problems about cross-examining him? We, if you comes and gives evidence against us, then we can either show that he's incorrect in a substantive way, or we can attack his credibility. How might we attack his credibility? He's got previous convictions, right. We know about that. No problem about bringing up his previous convictions? Right, we lose our shield. We have a shield under the which prevents the prosecution in a normal case from bringing to the attention of the court the fact that we have previous convictions. We are a, an innocent man until we are shown to be guilty. However, if we don't and we say we're lily white but the prosecution solicitor, prosecution witnesses, are all bent, then we lose that shield and they can say, hey you're not lily white, you're bent as well. Right. So, if gives evidence, having become competent because he has pleaded guilty, erm, then we can cross-examine him, but we are in difficulties if we then bring up his previous convictions attack his credibility. In the same way as you lose your shield whenever you attack a prosecution witness. So, for instance, if you have an argument with the police er on a matter, you might very well have to say to the police, I think officer you were take that and say you're a lying bastard . If you take the latter point of view but you will also put your client's character . Okay? If your client has good character, fine, if he's got bad character . What is the best tactical way of dealing with your client's bad character? Now second paragraph? Maybe. You don't really know how he had this information. It appears to be hearsay of some sort and therefore is erm inadmissible. What would you do about that if you were at court acting for your client?that paragraph from the earlier comments. Er, what would you do? You could have a trial. I would suggest that that is not very helpful. If you have a trial within a trial in the crown court, what happens? If you have a trial within a trial at the magistrates court, what happens? Yeah. and deal with your objection and then puts it out of their mind if they find that the evidence is inadmissible, doesn't work. Right. So it's very important that you avoid magistrates court. Why can't you avoid the magistrates court in this case? Erm, he did have the right to that trial for erm what the previous offence before taking conveyance which was a clock taken without the owner's consent and previous offence before that taking but in order to reduce costs right mainly because they also want at the same time to remove the right for theft ah and they failed. That is, of course , because people who steal biscuits from are usually are usually middle class etcetera etcetera but people who steal cars generally tend to be toerags, I think the expression is, erm and therefore nobody much cares. Right. So they lost their rights in that trial very bad idea. So how would you get round that? Good. pointing out the evidence that you think is inadmissible and any reasonable will the police officer doesn't refer to it. Okay? I'm still interested in paragraph one. You, you looked at this over the weekend and thought there's not much in this, is there? Hopefully you'll think again he's stating, I'm for it now. Distress it could be I suppose. It is intimately connected with the offence. Does anybody understand exception to the hearsay rule? He could be, but what is it really? Does anybody know? It's not really hearsay. No, because he's not actually admitting anything. I mean,if the police stop you on the motorway, you know you're for it, whether you've done anything or not. You'll certainly have an unpleasant few minutes True. It's admissible only reaction. The same as when you're charged you're asked if you have anything to say reaction only and not hearsay. Remember that hearsay is a statement, oral or written, made outside of court, introduced into court for the, in order to show that it's true, okay?you look completely gobsmacked. I am. Why would it be hearsay anyway? Because it's certainly a statement made out of court because or he's making it with reference to something else. Ah. If it's oral yes. That would be hearsay. It would not be simply direct evidence, yes. Alright makes his confession, let's assume at the moment that it is admissible and gives evidence . Anything about the statement itself, or, or the interview itself, that you would object to on behalf of? Why do you object to that? It's . It's completely inadmissible. Okay? Unless what? Sure, this is where I, this is where erm I must say that I never quite understood this, but if the prosecution witnesses, in their statements or in their oral evidence, refer to your client's bad character, then that is inadmissible, completely inadmissible. Right. If you then cross-examine them and attack their credibility your shield goes in and then after that your previous good character, but only in the context of you being cross-examined by the prosecution. Right. So at no stage would this ever go in. At no stage would this reference ever be admissible because it's not going to be relevant after your shield's gone in because your shield going in relates to the questions understanding be agree or correct me but this is how I understand the situation. So references to bad character are never admissible. There are other references to bad character here. showed me how to do it. It was 's fault, he made me do it. Okay? Var various other pathetic . What about ? Are you happy with his treatment at, at the police station? Why not? No record of the tape at all. Erm, or what else, crucially?? , more further crucial problem? Were you arrested and taken to the police station and cautioned? Erm What's the fir who's the first manifest you see? It's the custody sergeant, okay, the custody officer,the custody officer. So in so far as that affects the confession it may mean that it could be removed but that's really completely irrelevant to you because erm that's his confession, not evidence against him. If he comes to court, what happened at the police station doesn't matter because he'll then give direct evidence, not what he said in the police station but what actually happened on that night in the, in the estate. Does everybody follow that? Is anybody confused? Do you want me to go through that again? So the fact that there was no solicitor relevant in this case because the whole confession isn't relevant to It may be very very relevant to what happens to but with regard to your client , this statement is not evidence against him because his confession is admissible only against the maker. If he turns up for court and he says, yes I had a terrible time at the police station and there were all sorts of breaches of but I am now here on a, I'm gonna tell the truth, that's no problem. It's the evidence he gives on oath what matters. What happened before is irrelevant. Yes? Okay. Right . Let's go on to document three. We want to go through that line by line so Erm, what were the words you'd complain about? Erm, not necessarily complain but interview police officer about when he was told that upsets my mother Sorry, am I, oh yes, yes you're absolutely right. Is that it?object to, it's just a point which we thought about raising later on. We might be able to just So the rest of the paragraph you're obviously happy with? Anybody else? Anybody? Any comments? A woman came to the door who I, whom I recognized as , 's mother. She said, oh my God, they've come for . Hearsay exception relates to the state of mind of the defendant. What the relevance of what? Well, what can you primarily infer from the words ? Guilt, or? Conviction surely, known to the police? He recognizes her but how, how many er, let me put it this way, if the police came to your house to talk to your mother, would you expect them to recognize her, or would you expect him to say, oh my God they've come ? You may or may not . It would seem to show that er is known to the police. Okay? On the face of it, the argument I think is this, the words, oh my God he's come for are hearsay, sorry, are not hearsay, because although they're an out of court statement they're not introduced as the truth. They're just reported speech. Okay? But they are almost certainly excluded by common law. Does anybody know the common law principle? This may well be for those of you who did in fact agree. I don't think that the erm go into this properly and I don't, I think will have dealt with it in lectures, but essentially there's a common law principle that says if a matter is more prejudicial than evidential it should not be read. Here it may be that er it's important to say er what she said value or what relevance it has to the trial of the son anyway. But let's say he did. It clearly is highly prejudicial and therefore whatever spurious relevance it may have should be waived against prejudicial, in fact should be excluded. Okay? Right. , your client is interviewed, document four, are you happy with the contents ? Any other reasons for not being happy? Anybody else? Any other? erm, possibly drunk or possibly . Okay,problems,problems here. So what? Is that what you're worried about? Is that what you wanna do here? Do you want to it? Why do you want to it? It's not . It's not a paid profession and therefore the exclusion of this statement under section six two is irrelevant. This is not a confession. Is there anything here that constitutes anything approaching a confession? this, this is about being in lines. If you had it numbered, you could refer to a number. What page are we on? Er, page eleven It's twenty eight and sixty eight. . What, the man said, I'll get you for this? Right. Is that a confession? was convicted on the murder of after the judge ruled that a statement to the police was admissible. The statement he made was, you say you've got witnesses but none of them will give evidence against me. Okay? That was held to be a confession. Now. Okay, fair enough, it was turned over on appeal eventually erm but erm it was a bit of a miscarriage of justice being kept in prison for that period of time until it was overturned pleaded guilty to another murder but that's by the by. Potentially, the bastard I'll get him for this, could be a confession. It's pretty iffy but it is fairly ambiguous, isn't it? But the problem is if this is taken out of context with the rest of the statement, the judge might leave it to the jury. I don't think it would be right to do so. The judge should exclude it. So, what you have to argue is that that is not a confession. If it is not a confession the whole statement isn't a confession. it is, other than that. Is the statement admissible? Can detective constable come to court, show the jury, hand out to the jury the statement which would stand up in court? No. Why not? And? Good. It is not an exception to the rule gives details of alibi witnesses. What should the police do about those alibi witnesses? Find them. Find them, check 'em out. Let's look at er document five. Okay?, do you want to deal with that? Comments in that should tell you that is retired. He's unemployed and retired, in his sixties. I do understand the expression, to know by sight. The Oxford University Library should be worried , but I said what about his sight? I should, I should warn you that it's best to say that only witnesses perhaps have problems with their sight, not that they are senile. Because . Alright? So, there are problems about the identification. No. No she doesn't. Can you cut it up really small? Yes. Hey! I'm afraid there most of it's bust. Will Matt like this piece? Go on take that away Matt. You haven't. Go in there. I'm hungry as well. Well, well Matt What happens now? Just eat. Save that fucking cabbage! He eats this. He eats this. He eats baby food! Yep! Baby Carly's food. That's right. No baby Baby food! Messed up cabbage and and No baby food. Right, if any of the supermarkets have a baby counter anywhere here? For baby food? Yeah, you have baby food! This is cabbage and carrot. Mhm. Eats baby food. Yeah, cabbage and carrot! Look. I can give you a leg son. Ha ha ha! You You got You got him a leg? No. I won't eat all that! No way! I'm just and then you can Leave what you don't want. leave what you don't want. Alright, nay problem! I won't eat a leg as well. Right, come here then. Yeah! interest, we're now There's ? Is that, is that Matt's or yours? Where? Over there. Whose is this? I don't want one. We haven't got any cheesecake. Have I seen that one? One I am Hello! when I am ne Do you want a bit of chicken Laura? This is my Is that alright? I don't need my I have brown chairs. He actually said Mine. if you wanna ask Laura if she'd what did Sheila say to you? Well I Are you hungry? Yeah, and what did you say? who are No. Yes, you are hungry. Are you hungry? my No! You got a sore tummy? Have you got a sore tummy? Yeah? He don't eat a lot. You're full of crap Laura to be quite honest with you! You're just Yep! aren't you? Erm have you We're just waiting for it's Lesley and we'll have some photos er This chicken's hot . She's got a sore tummy. I'm reading a book. She's got a sore tummy cos she's not eating enough! Give her that. Give her some. Just a wee drop of chicken Laura? No. Some spuds and some peas and and carrots. Where's my plate? You've not had enough. How many shall I set the table for? You kids can sit there and we'll sit at the table. What? There look! Big spoon! Laura have a look at the chicken there, is that enough for you? Mm. Are you sure? Fine! What about some er spuds? Gravy! Mm! Want spuds? Yes please. Well I've got some of Matt's. Doesn't matter if you leave it, no. Do you want some more? Do you want some? Take half of this. Oh, can we take the skin off,. Take the bone off right? Pardon? Do you want the skin off? Yes please dad. I'll have some mashed potato. You'll have some mashed potato in a minute Laura. What? You can get that off. Mm. I'll see if that swede I want Swede? Yes,. Well it's whatever he wants. Go and sit down just now Laura. I'll do the dishwasher, if you want. You never mind the dishwasher! I know! I'm packing it . You hear what mummy said! Leave it just now son. I'll pack it all this afternoon if you like. That is on rinse, it'll cool down. That enough chicken for you Matt? Yeah, that's plenty. Will that cool down a bit? Yeah, when it's off. What are you having? Just that, I'll come back for it. I'm more than happy. a bit. . Matt, do you want a gravy? Please? Matt? Yes please? You didn't ask us whether we want Here Laura, eat that. Chris, do you want gravy? Yep! Yes, Chris wants gravy. Leave that. We're gonna get a knife and fork now . You sit down there son. When? Take the salt and pepper in. And that is nice bits of skin on there for you son. Right, thanks. She told me she wasn't having any. She's not ge , okay something to eat and still . Because her stomach, it's alright if she's not been sick. .Don't mind at all. She's alright now inside. Your dumb comments will not be required! Alright. Okay? Okay. Yeah. Sit up!

You might likely be in bed if you don't eat that! Don't force me! What? I really don't want that . Well if you , you'll never eat it. So you won't be able to take it yourself. I am eating it really. I know you are. I'm not! You are! She will. She will! I get it's just the stomach ache . You've got stomach ache cos you're not eating! Mm! Is that ? Oh well I won't eat anything at all. Got stomach ache. You've got stomach ache cos you're not eating! Yeah! Leave me alone! I'm not sympathetic. When a new car comes well cos me and Chris will will have a drive of it. Cos you go of it on my own. Yeah. Don't wanna drive it! Then you'll miss out. You'll miss out all the good things! Cos you'll be in bed . Yeah. You're going to try You'll again Laura. But who says this? What am I doing without ? Not eating everything!? Mhm. Too much meat! Too much meat! You're starving dude! You you're greedy! Lovely! What about you then! Yeah! Yeah! Well!

When. Quite a lot there . Oh! Erm . Shall I tell you afterwards? Not quite sure. Not quite sure of anything! Tell you about that one. Ashley? Straight up! Look! Yeah. All the cassettes they gave us. Christ! All the thingummies and what have you. Got a log book and And how long have you gotta you know sacked or wh And I mean they weren't sacked in a sense, they was always ready there was a place ready for them to come back to there. But erm So laid off I suppose would be a more appropriate way of s of putting it. So that it was it was generally thought of as being a fair system ? Yes. In the main I I should think yes. You know you know erm a young man I mean it was er er reasonable wasn't it for a a single man to be laid off before a married man with family family responsibilities. And er generally er with families being larger er in those days, erm there'd be perhaps another couple of sons working or or something like to help. make a family income you know or or increase the family income. Or So they could all eat at least. And erm no well as I say, erm I think they were pretty fair. I mean f I d I doubt whether firms would do it these days eh? It wouldn't be considered fair today anyway. No the union would step in probably and er say that er last in er first out or some ruddy Mm. nonsense like that eh? But that's the memory I have of it eh? Wh when you went in as an apprentice, did you have any i i idea of what the job was. What it entailed? Oh yes, erm you know, having been brought up w in a you could almost say a quarrying atmosphere that's the right er expression but erm I mean one knew what w went on in the quarry you know. Erm mind you it was really a step onto something else that as far as I was concerned in those days I meant o go to sea of course and er that was the best place you could have er to serve an apprenticeship because everything er I mean it was one of the As everything was starting to get specialized in in other works nowadays it's gone completely now. But erm we had a sort of a spectrum you know it covered such a wide well area if you like of er of engineering that one wouldn't have had a chance to to have a any contact with in in any other works, you'd be doing as one certain sphere you know a certain type of work, and there you are you that's your lot eh? But we covered everything you know, steam engines and diesel engines and oh crushers and construction work and development and pneumatic gear, compressors and oh any damn thing that went going. We made everything ourselves more or less. And had a hand in oh designing really there. We were always taught This er comes back again. I think er you know this our our boss, er who Mr as he was called he was given his full title of er Mr William Owen , then. I mean er much more should have been something should have been Aye he's well worth er within the engineering world at least, well worth looking into his life really. Because he he he's done a a you know he he he's been a a a a what shall I say, a Well he's done a lot really to to to to to promote erm interest in engineering and all that and and he's done a lot in helping er to young men to become engineers and that you know. He he he's erm really er the results of his his interest in teaching. Er North Wales you know have have benefited. Firms in North Wales here along the coast which came after the war of course. Can you sort of amplify that if you can? Well As I told you to begin with, he he he he must he was a man was er years ahead of his tim really. I mean and he he although he er he wasn't a graduate or anything like that I mean he he was a brilliant engineer. His ideas are as I they they say that he was er I don't know how much truth I that he was the first that he patented and devised the first rotating drilling machine. Rock drilling machine you see. Cos the f the the the they did have pneumatic drilling machines quarries. For ooh from beginning of the century I suppose. But they were only hammers in a sense. They only hammered the they the the they didn't rotate. I see. They just r r rammed their way and you had an man the they had a man they tell me I I've never seen one But erm this was as far as I can make out er by the They had a man standing by you see with a a spanner and er gave it a quarter turn every time it hammered the the drill sort of hit the rock, went into the and hammered. They had to give it a quarter turn you see with a spanner. But erm that old the A and B we used to call them actually. A and B. Erm there was no dis disrespect but A and B and er he'd erm he devised a method he what he did he rifled the inside of the the piston. He rifled the inside of the the the the cylinder and the piston was rifled as well, you know slightly ribbed, so as it went forward it turned you see. Came back and there was a er it couldn't turn cos there was erm Oh dear I'm forgetting my engineering terms but er you know it's a that's the . And that's this is er I think I've already told you that he was offered a job with Ingersoll Rand which were the main er people that dealt with air and air products in the old days. The American firm. They tried to get him to America you see. But he wouldn't go there. William didn't want to take his overalls off. Because he he liked to work with his hands. Yes he was a heck of a man. He could he was a brilliant machinist and er oh crikey I've seen him turn out a a three throw er crankshaft within a couple of days er you know without any precise measuring and and and in fact he just sort of put his roll on on on a on the shaft he was turning and just sort of gave him an idea as to I mean his eye was almost as good as many a bloke's measur measurement with a rule. But er a three throw crankshaft for a bump you know couple of days to erm he was a heck of a man. And he dis We had I haven't told you er didn't tell you or h I er don't think I've told you have I, that we did have a a chemist in the quarry you know. Full time chemist. Would he be analyzing samples? Yeah analyzing yes. Mr his name was. And he apparently was a very very nice man too er I mean he was I mean er er er er a nice disposition I mean yeah. they stand out . And er oh he he was he erm during the war now come nineteen thirty nine and that stale period when er there was nothing doing really in France, between the time that er our expedition to the to the Maginot line and all that. Er he went over s there was a plane laid on for him and he was ve went over very often to advise them on fortifications on all their concrete fortifications in France. Did he? Yes yeah. Very well thought off actually. And he designed some er I remember them being built. Erm air raid shelters. Built to his design under the rock face up at the top here in . And er concrete and all stuff. And er rock er dropped use that expression, they used they were both right at the at the foot of the quarry face or precipice or whatever somewhere around a hundred foot high and then th they blasted the top see and dropped a whole fall. A fall is what we call you know a bundle of Rock. rock there. Ah excuse me. And erm on this er structure and obviously there wasn't a everything was fine inside it. Mind you, no-one volunteered to stay inside when it was . But erm all the intact Now, a slight apology to make. This, things aren't going very well for me today. Er, I missed the train, the video thing wouldn't work when I showed my film lunchtime and er, the book that had to read, er, unfortunately, is not in the library, so er, the le let me explain the background to this. In previous years I haven't had a class on the and I thought I had one this year as an experiment and er, pardon me just a second hello yes, that was a little annoying to say the least, cos those students have come in specially for that, yeah,yeah yeah yeah yeah right Oh dear right certainly not well, would it be easier to show them in my office, that's seven, seven, seven? Well, I could fit most of them in, I'm currently getting in about twelve, ten or twelve, I could fit them in. Alright, let's do that. Could we, could we have it from next Tuesday in my room? That's seven, seven, seven. Yeah, and you could perhaps let me, let me have erm, let me have one of those little ones. Perhaps I could keep it, could I? Right, okay yes, sure, sure, sure. Well, shall we have it in my room for next week? Thanks a lot. Bye . This audio visual, ah I apologize for that. Sorry, this will be printing for a while. It's just my new book. I'm sorry. You'll just have to put up with the printer chugging away. As I was saying, yes, er erm, I put it down, erm are you gonna tell us the history of the book, or? Yeah. There is a bit of Right, okay. Well, let's wait and hear wh what says, he'll probably explain to you the history of why it is like this. But as I said, I do apologize. There was a copy in the library at one stage, although not listed under it was under , but I now see that when the other day I looked erm, according to er, there isn't even anything under . Did you look under too? Yeah Right, right so I'm very sorry. I won't do it again next year. We won't have a class on that's just somebody that republishes the book. But erm, anyway er, tell us what you made of it and we'll take it from there, I think. Well, the book was er published in the early nineteen, well, it was written in the early nineteen thirties but er, it wasn't actually published until nineteen sixty seven. Erm, for instance idealistic man primarily, Wilson, President of the United States. So basically, subject given account of er Wilson's life and his personality. In context the psychoanalysis in order to explain erm Wilson's actions and er, attitudes in the pres presidency of the United States during the First World War, basically con concentrates on erm . Despite highlighting er Wilson's intellectual and physical achievements, for instance, he er wrote a very er, well respected book called Con Congressional Government in his earlier cabinet career, and also he initiated domestic reforms , the book is er generally quite scornful, reporting character. Especially the neurosis he suffered from erm, throughout his life on which the his presidential and political career. The main argument put forward by er, er, was that er was that Wilson suffered as an adult, because of the over oppressed rage he, oppressed rage he possessed, which was directed towards his father. As a child, Wilson was er, regularly subjected to the darkness father and criticized and lectured the young Wilson. However, instead of er releasing and dealing with his rage, Wilson er instead chose to strongly identify with his father, erm argued er Wilson never grew beyond his father identification, because the situation whereby er Wilson was full of, of the conviction that his er mission in life was somehow divided. In identifying with what he regarded as his father, Wilson thought that he would er emerge from the war as a saviour to the world, so to speak. two went further in an effort to oppress his rage against his father, and to avoid a highly threatening career situation. Wilson identified with his father, to the extent of wanting to have genital, genital contact with him, since Wilson saw his father as the author of all his skills, his strength and all that he'd been grateful for . This was based on apparently wrote to obtain er, or basically to obtain. This is arguably supported by the close contact of the relationship Wilson had with his father, and Wilson's deeply held religious conviction, which he espoused in his presidency. However, this subconsciously held conflict with his father in subsequent over identification with er led Wilson to be somewhat stubborn,perhaps even complicational as a, as you know, as presidency of the United States, which were, were often directed towards or often only minor details of his work, but he wouldn't he wouldn't actually range them towards say, any major . Er, accompanying this accompanying this frequently not himself, which it occurred throughout his life, through his childhood as well, and his general er sustained willpower which was highlighted by frequent illnesses, especially in his er president of the university, where Wilson suffered defeats and conflicts and transfer of reform of rebuilding the university, and also we see there er back part of his life a Wilson of his own er, seem to direct some of his rage against er, a coloured colleague of his, a . Graham argued that all this is indicative of a person who hasn't grown, fully grown out of his childhood worries, problems, especially the er, he hasn't actually dealt with the true feelings that he had towards his father, and who instead chose to vent his rage on others and political career, which resulted in Wilson being, er well, losing some of his rationality, which led to his poor performance in er negotiating and gaining acceptance of the Treaty of after World War One. Erm, apparently that's what the trouble with the ratifying in Congress that led him erm,some degree to another centre in Massachusetts. Erm, and this also explains in part, why he er complains made by-rules and all concerned what was into Europe, did not materialize. Er, I think if you're gonna try and erm, explain you know, try and assess the validity of the book. Agree or ask yourselves why you agree. Tell us about various reasons, not just study of value of the great of the greatest value there. It seems Freud and perhaps even wanted to er, vent their anger on Wilson, because of his failures concerning the war and its aftermath. Immediately after the war, when Bullett first approached Freud er, with the idea of writing the book, Freud was apparently feeling very depressed, and er, he was savagely critical of his own work, and er, because he had little access to patients during the war, he generally felt quite down and also by presenting written for him, all he would need to wr all he would need to write, and according to er,other people, perhaps he was eating, he was receiving just sort of waiting to die. Whether that's er,I'm not too sure. Erm, anyway, this was when Bullett actually first approached Freud ninetee nineteen hundred and twenty. The disappointment with Wilson felt like Freud must have sort of lingered for quite a long time, cos it was not for eight years that he actually ventured on . This was highlighting the fact, that although, er, Freud thought psychoanalytic should be used in a neutral nerve and not used for any active aggression, an exception seemed to be made with Woodrow Wilson. Although some may be quick to say that the vast majority of the book was actually written by Bullett, and not by Freud, no less than the actual intellectual framework of the book apparently seems to have been due to Freud's input, er, Freud certainly was psychoanalytically trained, in any, in any sense of the word. Er, perhaps the whole project could also be attributed, mainly I think, to Freud's desire to try and keep open the er, the er, analytic publishing house, which he founded in and which er, basically was kept together financially from the er, forwarded, forwarded er, royalties which Bullett sent from America. er, the book has been very heavily attacked by contemporary writers even mentioned passing for the . Complaints have been made, for instance, by erm, er,. The er, book is based on an inaccurate and sometimes even fabricated evidence, due probably to the er, rather idealistic er, excitable ambitious er Bullett, rather than the peaceful like of Freud. Nevertheless, evidence er, was dealt with by our assorted version parent. Much due to the influence of Freud, cos of course, Bullett wasn't a . Contemporary studies of Wilson by, for example, or perhaps even are apparently based much more on fragmented material than Bullett and Freud, Freud would allow. I can't really clarify that . Erm, for example, it appears that Freud and Bullett er, misinterpreted Wilson, especially as regards to the nature of his father. For example, argues that Wilson did not have any sort of homosexual likeness for his father. But that Wilson longed for a psychic union with fantasy, fantasy father. So that er, Woodrow could experience a full sense of self, to actually relate back to his himself, which er, Wilson er, experienced only as a child. His childhood. Er, you have a sexualization of such a long period, Wilson, er, didn't seem to have, sort of, being recorded to his sexual fantasies of that nature. Although there is er a general agreement that Wo situations were, were re really more complicated,in the Wilson family, er,Wil erm, Wilson actually certainly loved his father, his er his mother an and his er father. Er,Wi Wilson, er, did not seem to allow his father's wit and criticism to get him as much as Freud had er, suggested. Er, certainly evidence seems to suggest that a very genuine and close relationship developed with his father. For ex for instance, they er, often confided in one another , usually when they to see what they actually er share each other 's deepest thoughts, and this continued throughout later life, it could be argued bu but it continued throughout later life and what they, they often communicated by er, by letter. It could be argued from this, that er, Wilson's father began to identify more of his son rather than the other way round. Especially as Wilson's academic career flourished, and he er, and he wrote to his father less and less. So of er, resulted in a rather er, sad feeling in his father, the thought that actually his son was starting you started to by his son. argues that er, Wilson suffered from strokes throughout his life,not even emotionally recorded due his psychological condition. The reason why this occurred er erm, the reason why this occurred was not due to some sort of er, due to emotional problems that he suffered within these repressed relations with his son. Erm, and also the reason why Wilson could not actually read until the age of eleven was not due to the emotional er, problems of his father, it was due to a sort of a form of dyslexic er,th there's a hell of a lot of debate about this, er, all these things just what er, Einstein is er, criticizing. But er,sad sadly there's er, evidence that sh show that if there is a dyslexic. Erm, however, it maintains that er, Freud could not have er, known about this, although it seems to invalidate if they are correct . Erm, if the move on the was psychoanalytic issue, er despite the book being generally regarded as an embarrassment to psychoanalytic, is somewhat non . It er, has initiated others to demonstrate how the use of a psychoanalytic science for the actions of upstanding, public, historical figures. Biographical studies can be found on a variety of historical people, including various artists or politicians. But this simply underlines a point that psychoanalysis is, by the very nature biographical, thus historical point, er, historical methods to trace one's actions and reports in the presents, present er, relation to those who they've experienced in the past. If your psychoanalysis is reports, and not just the actions, of it can be a, used as arguments to er, allow this story to emphasise what the human ages evolved at specific suicide of men, erm, goes on to show examples of his erm, he actually claimed to have used this as a sort of process of identification of even fantasizing, in order to try and er demonstrate how er, I think it was Hadrian's Wall was built, try to identify with engineers and architects who built Hadrian's Wall, in order to try and work out what the actual function of the wall was. It wasn't, it wasn't regarded, it was regarded by a positivistic er,as just being er a big wall to stop barbarians er, attacking . People have said he er, they seem to think, that he was more, he was more the sort of territorially divide sheriff sort of er, league of division between er, the two lands, and he was also a sort of lookout post. Erm, this er, again, try to be right be er try to understand the mind,instead of just, just looking at the harsh facts, the hard cold facts and trying from there. So, in effect, there's a subjective animal which can be very useful when trying to explain a glimpse, for example, employed for example the total I E prime and er, also in the psychological . These books also extend beyond a biographical compass of the history, by examining the development of insecurities in society, like as in the future of civilian. And also the relationship between the leaders and the masses in history, er, between the different groups er and then comparing the relations between these masses and different groups and different parts of history. Er, and it can be also er, also er, course in civilizations in history and trace in theory selection in society. Er, psychoanalysis is important, because it acts as a realis as a realistic er, dimension to historical analysis. There is a tendency to try and lo er, continually adjust the plain hard facts, without recognizing that they are, they are in fact socially constructed. That's the objective. It must be supplemented with the subject. For allowing ourselves to look at the report and find the actions, and not just the actions themselves. Erm, so in this, so in times of the Woodrow Wilson or perhaps Freud er, took the subject too, too far. Allow his own feelings and thoughts just to run away with him, which later er, in rather er, a nasty very er, made some very disparaging remarks of the family. But despite the er, rather individualistic nature of the context used there's enough flexibility and openness within the subject content, to say . The psychoanalysis can be used to a limited extent, despite more collective, historical roles er, within disagreed over conflicts in people, or perhaps you say that all the time. Erm, going back to the subjective erm, psychoanalysis introduces erm, no, that's the subject erm, psychoanalysis introduces. Also historians themselves, historians themselves can't actually completely stand outside the events they are actually studying. I mean,th th they're just moving away from the issue, because it it's using a psychoanalytic stories. Try to give a psychoanaly psychoanalytic study issue. Erm, can you keep with me? The er, the very important experiences of this story were never to be received into his work. Or our work. And would be useless the er, content and electrons. I suppose er, suppose that, suppose that er, main department store other contents from other dimensions. Psychological content, but again, in that content, in that er, particular content, psychoanalytical context can be useful. Well done,w well done , excellent, I mean. Although as I said, it was perhaps a mistake, erm, both classes produced excellent papers, that th it was a first class paper, in the other class and so was yours. didn't read the book. Where did you get all that material from then? Erm, books on psycho history publish yours. Right,. Oh, you went through all the psycho history books? Yeah, well done. Erm, well it's a great achievement. I think that given that you were er, you couldn't find the basic book that you were expected to read, I thought you, you gave an excellent account of it, I mean, if you hadn't told us that you hadn't got the book, I don't think we would have guessed, would we? You would've got away with that one. But erm, no, absolutely first rate. Well done. I think you can, you can really erm, you can really be proud of yourself on that. And erm well, what do other people think, I mean what, I suppose no one else began to look at it either. I will be giving a lecture on it, so I'll have my say about it. Erm, has anybody looked at any of the other books, like for example, the one on ? Did you? I didn't have time. Has anybody got the time? I'll tell you the reason why I did this. Erm, in a way this was a bit provocative. What I what I thought was, well let's have erm, Woodrow Wilson, okay, as you said at the beginning of the book, Freud admits that he didn't like Wilson, and that he felt betrayed by Wilson, like a lot of people in Central Europe did I suppose, because you know, Wilson came over erm, with fourteen points as the saviour of the world, and went away leaving with a piece of . And Freud and a lot of other German speaking people, thought that he had let them down, because he didn't have the political goodness. Erm, and so Freud at the beginning says that he er, he, he had a personal dislike of er Wilson, and resented him for what he had done and held him responsible for the subsequent disasters. So, so Freud makes no bones about it. Erm, the book by Leo who's er Labour, was a Labour M P, no longer er keen collection reports. Erm, on , I put in because it was the worst example I could find of the abuse of psychoanalysis for destroying somebody's personality, personality assassination by, by er a psychoanalysis. You could imagine what it's like. I mean, erm, if you didn't know it was meant to be serious, you might think it was a great send off of psychoanalysis, you know. Kind of make you hoot with laughter half the time, erm, and the contrast with that is the point, which I don't know whether any of you has looked at, of course, called Gandhi's Truth. Well, as you might tell from the title, Gandhi's Truth is the exact opposite to book, because it idealizes Gandhi, it makes a, a kind of psychoanalytic behaviourography, you know as if Gandhi was some er, great great kind of saint. Despite the fact that Gandhi one would have thought provided rich material for psychoanalysts, like going to bed with his erm, nieces and his lady doctor erm, and naked and claiming that this was a specific exercise, erm. Nice work if you can get it. Erm, and so on, so, so, so this was the, this was the, er this is what I was trying to do, try and contrast the use of psychoanalysis in, in biography, from character assassination on one hand, to hagiography at the other, and with Freud's Woodrow Wilson somewhere in, in between , but perhaps nearer the character assassination end, because erm, neither of them, er neither of the authors were, really had, had much of a brief of Woodrow Wilson. And, and really it was just as experiment, and erm, the reason I put it in was, I thought, well, you know, this is, this is an ignored book, and as you, as you found to your cost, it's actually hard to come by, harder to come by than I expected. It's out of print. Yeah, it's out of print, and erm, but I though it raised interesting issues, anyway. I mean did other people think that? And what kind of issues did you think it does raise? It's not worth psychoanalysis Right, now as mentioned, there's a whole literature on this course,ps psycho-history, isn't there? They've even got their own journal. Have you, have you read any of this stuff,? Erm, this is, this is what this school of thought tries to do. In the past I used to have a, a class on psycho- history, and I dropped it, and one of the reasons why I dropped it was, the lit a lot of the literary was very poor quality, for a start, and erm, people, er, students, er got that too, and I couldn't really blame them. And, er, the other problem with it is, you really have to know quite a lot about history, or biography to really to really get into. I think you found that with Wilson There was one chapter in the book, I read it in the . All the pages in biography . Five or six pages instant analysis and it hardly No. Absolutely, so Two novels If yo I hope you, I suppose you could have a whole course in psycho-history, if you really put into it enough, but for just one class, I thought it was too much to ask students to attend, to try and have to get into psycho-history, so I haven't erm, done very much of it, and this, my excuse here really was, well Freud did write a book called Woodrow Wilson. It is touching on the social sciences in the sense that Woodrow Wilson was an important political figure, and there is an historical dimension. So that was my excuse, for, for, for bringing it in. But as says, I mean it raises er, a fundamental issue, which is, is psychoanalysis or, psycho, are psycho insights applicable to for example history or biology, and this is the issue, isn't it? What do people think that? Is it just, is it, is it, is it just trivializing, to think, to talk about, for example, Woodrow Wilson's childhood? I mean, does anybody think that's a trivial approach to history? I mean Do you think so? Yeah. Do everybody agree with that? you tell it Yes, of course, erm the point has to be made, that Bullett, unlike contemporary erm, biographers of er Wilson, those people you mentioned, actually knew Wilson, and an you know, being his administration on that man as it were , and apparently Bullett had a lot a first-hand erm, biographical data, didn't he, according to the book? Also tended towards to make a judgment of him, Mm. I think Right. Right, and the background to that of course is, for those of you who may not know, Bullett was I suppose a more junior person in the State Department, when he went to Europe with Woodrow Wilson in nineteen eighteen, and nineteen whenever it was for a peace conference, and Bullett was the only one of the American delegation who resigned and confronted Wilson and said, look, you've gone back on the fourteen points, you're not doing what you said you would do. How can you go on with this, and Bullett was the only one of them who resigned and went home. And er, later of course, he became the American Ambassador of Vienna, so Freud met him, but so, so, Bullett had a personal stake in this, but I must admit, er my own view was, was rather to admire Bullett for his stand, because it's a rare politician who stands up and says look, you know, we've been there, having made promises, we've broken all of them, and we ought to resign, or you ought to resign. He told Wilson. And, and he said, you know, if you aren't going to resign, I certainly am. And he did. So erm, it's quite true that Bullett had a personal axe to grind, I think it was a rather justified axe. But erm, it er, that fact remains, he did nail Wilson. He was at the conference, and a lot of the book, if you read the book, is concerned with what actually happened at the conference, and basically, the basic problem with the, the book tries to look at, and this is where we, we get back to question of the childhood days. Why couldn't Wilson stand up to the allies, why couldn't had stand up to Clements or Lloyd George, in particular? They seem to have bullied him and made him er, make concessions, and the question that Freud and Bullett constantly ask is, why did Wilson make these concessions, especially since his position was already defined before he came to Europe, you know he already laid down the fourteen points, and sold it to the American people. And then he came to Europe and, and really, let it all go. And their answer of course is, look, here was erm, there's no political or historical reason, because Wilson had all the cards in his hand. The, admittedly the French and the British were on the right side, they won the war, but France er was er battered in the war, lost an awful lot of people, it's a common and although this country, although, you know, fighting in Britain, the er, British economy was also badly damaged. We were borrowing money from the Americans to keep going, and er, we certainly weren't in any shape to dictate the terms of the peace to the Americans. And er, so Freud and Bullett say, look if Wilson had all the power at the time, and some ways the world in nineteen eighty to twenty was a bit like what it is today, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, really, you really only got one superpower. If, if the Americans had all the power, why did Woodrow Wilson just sell out to the Allies? So, Bullett and Freud conclude, well, it has to be something to do with him personally. And their conclusion is, he couldn't stand up to, to Lloyd George in and the reason was these were strong, erm, male leaders, and Wilson, when it came to being with men, er, was weak, and the question asked is, why was he weak in dealing with men? And the answer is, well, if you look at his relationship with his father, er, he was very overawed by his father, he was very passive and submissive towards his father. And so there they, they claim that his childhood was relevant, because of this character defect in, in Wilson, his inability to stand up to strong men. Even though objectively, he had all the strength on his side, and if he'd only stubbornly insisted, the allies would have had to accept the fourteen points, because there was no way that they just didn't have any erm, any clout really when when finally settled in peace. Wilson could almost have dictated it to them, and perhaps another man would have. So this is their justification for bringing in the childhood. What do you think of that remark? Is that legitimate, do you think, or not? Yeah, I think it is. erm you have, when you see the statesmen Well, what about the view, let me kind of play devil's advocate here against Freud and Bullett. What about the view? That in history, the important things of economic, er historical, social forces which transcend any individual. What about that view, that the individual person, even a powerful one, like the President of the United States, doesn't really count, compared with economic social geo-political forces, what about that argument?, how does that . Is that the kind of argument that carries any weight with you? Erm, I can tell you what the other to look at the personality things like that Right, right. It seems, you know, because Freud didn't actually analyze just to make a generalization about things he knew about some of the people. Yes. And that sort of thing counts for what Yes, that's that's, let me see who that is? Hi. Well, that's his office there. He's not there now. I don't know. Have a word with his secretary. Erm, the, yes, I mean, this is a big problem, isn't it? The question is, as you rightly say, in psychoanalysis, the analyst usually has a vast amount much more than people normally realize, I mean, I recall from my own analysis, and mean I was going between two and four times a week erm, for an hour each time and it was a good six months before she would make any interpretations, and I used to get very frustrated, you know, I used to say things like, well, what do you think of this, Miss , you know. What do you think of that, and she would say, well, it's too early, or we don't know yet. You know, and she would constantly say that, and before six months, there weren't any interpretations at all. Then when interpretations did come, particularly if I disputed them, then it would be, she would be ready with the information. She would say, there, there's the of that dream, or those associations, with this you did. There was all that, and so on, and she would be ready with it, and there was a lot of material there. The problem, as you rightly say, with this kind of secondhand announcers, that how do you know if you've got enough material, and that it's right? Also, if you actually read the book, there is quite a lot of material in the book, it's quite a big book in some ways, and er, the material on Wilson's childhood and so on, erm, is pretty detailed. I mean there is quite a lot seems to be known about Wilson, and he himself, erm, wrote a lot in enormous correspondence and so on, and many of the points they make, are erm, are fairly well validated. Why, for example, one of the, the points that Freud's book makes, is er when Wilson was confronted with a conflict, particularly with a stronger male, like an elder brother, or his father, he would retreat into speech making, and apparently he used to have a barn where he did it, and he used to go and give speeches in the barn. He used to speak to the hay, as it were, and he would do this, er, rather compulsively. This kind of speech making. And of course, when he was a man, he was famous for his speeches, apparently, he was a great, was a great waffler, you know, it was the age of wafflers, I suppose. Erm, we heard a great, he was a great erm,refratition So when Freud and Bullett say, look, Woodrow Wilson was a great refratition and you can see him doing this in his childhood. There is actual evidence that he did do it in his childhood, and th so they're not erm, they're kind of building everything on a single sentence like Leo does, you know, amazingly enough, Leo 's book starts with entry of Who's Who in a single phrase, where she calls herself daughter of, her father. Doesn't mention her mother, and Leo 's whole thesis about was built on this single phrase in Who's Who. words, some future researched, that the printer here, missed that bit, you know, she should have said, and her mother's name, but her mother's got missed out on the proofs or something, I don't, this is the kind of thing that happens, of course. Leo 's entire book will collapse, er, as, as, as perhaps it should. Being a writer of course, being the data problem, er, this is a big problem in psychoanalysis, because whereas erm, in an analysis, the analyst has er hundreds or probably thousands of hours' data from the pre-associations of the patient, at the end. The er, that kind of thing is never published, and or even, of course, it can't be published normally, and the result is that when analysts draw conclusions based on this very confidential data, or who were talking vastly extent. It, it's very very difficult to, to validate perhaps erm, publicly. Yeah. making explanations the other way round. They are theory that you made a mistake, and you've got to somehow explain that They are They are, they're starting with the end result, and of course in this particular book, they're, what they're starting with really, wasn't a general psychological biography of Wilson, so much has, the problem, why did Wilson give everything away in the conference? That . They work backwards as, as, as you rightly say. The, the, the best defence you could make of that, if you wanted to make a defence of it, would be that in the nineteen twenties and thirties as we've been seeing in the lectures, I'll be saying a bit more about that some psychoanalyse was, was developing. It's analysis of the egos as, as we've been seeing, in analysis was really all, all it could do at the beginning, after the First World War, shall we say. breaking point. After the First World War, ego analysis was developing. Now one of the consequences that ego analysis was, analysts began to feel confident that they could analyze the defences of the ego, as well as what the ego repressed as a result of its defences. As a result of that, you could examine a defensive structure, and work out why it existed. For example, supposing you erm, this, this, this was used principally in child analysis, which didn't exist before the First World War, it was developed afterwards. The problem with child analysis is, children won't be associated, that can be made to free associate. I mean, don't ask me to explain it's technical and so it's a very technical matter of ego psychology that you must accept . They can't be induced to do it. And anyway, they don't have the motives. Children are always for analysis, usually by their parents, they don't usually come of their . So the analysts found they couldn't use free association with children. What they could use, was defence analysis. So for example, if you saw a child, who was pathologically independent, wouldn't form emotional attachments or dependencies on other people of the way the child wanted it. The analyst might conclude, well why is this defence structure excessive independence present in this child? A good suggestion might be, in the past this child has suffered a loss of some figure it was dependent on, and has compensated by becoming highly independent. This was a common finding, and Freud often found this in all children during the war. Some of them compensated by becoming highly independent in the end. So what you could do, you could see the defence, and then from that you could work backwards, to the motive of the defence. So, perhaps the reason is the loss of a love object, and then of course if you found there was a in fact a loss of a love, love object, then you might to see in greater detail, how this whole thing came about. Particularly if you discover that that child didn't have a bad characteristic in their in their ego before this event occurred, and so on. So that kind of thing made analysts think that they could go on more than just free associations, they could look at a person's character, as it were. The structure of ego defences, and then draw conclusions. And really, you see, that's what Freud and Bullett are doing in this book. They're looking at Wilson's character, which was quite a, a peculiar one, in both senses of the word, and not just peculiar in the sense of, of, you obviously need to him a peculiar sense of kind of funny, funny peculiar. And they try to work backwards, as you rightly say, to his childhood, to explain why, and, and of course they felt that their explanation, explained the favour of conflicts, because the whole thing was here was a man with an almighty father. Who saw himself as Jesus, really, and although Jesus came to save the world, he saved the world in a rather masochistic manner, by getting crucified. Well, that's exactly what happened to Woodrow Wilson. He came to save the world in nineteen eighteen, but he got crucified by Clements or Lloyd George. They made mincemeat of fourteen points. And er, so it's, it's an attempt to work backwards, but it has a certain justification in analytic technique. But of course, as you and er, er er, rightly said, in an analysis you would always be able to confirm these interpretations from the patient, because in the end, of course , psychoanalysis is done by the patient, the analyst doesn't do it. The analyst normally just helps. In the end, the analysis is gonna occur, it's the patient who, who really doesn't analyze their ego comes to grips with the unconscious. Of course, in a book you can't handle them, and you can't handle them when the subject is dead. So that will, corroborating dimension of psychoanalysis, what the patient does for himself and cannot possibly count, and as you rightly say, this leaves analytic biography erm, in a, in a kind of limbo. Which is, I really do unsatisfactory. And er, one has to admit, when you look at the literature of like, you know Gandhi, and and this kind of thing, and a lot of it's psycho-history stuff. Erm, you can't help feeling that there has been a mistake. Is that your impression of this? No one does that, yes, that's erm Well, what, why do you think Why? Erm,just having different it's different than what Yeah. it's different than what people normally think Yes, it's interesting you see, if you, if you can compare Freud with other writers who are in the same kind of area and league like . Why do people put up with anything from . Er, we know that systematically seduced a lot of his female patients. He forced his wife to put up with having his mistress living in the house with them. Unfortunate woman erm, er, he as long as they were winning the war, was, was open in his admiration of Hitler and the Nazis. His none of this is ever mentioned about , you know, mention to anybody, and there's er, you know, er, you know, he's one of the good guys. But er, if Freud had done any of that, you'd never hear the end of it. Freud, Nazi lover, you know, Freud, seducer, all this kind of stuff. People would go on about. Erm, and yet erm people like could get away with it. Er, you know, great ethologist, local supporter of the Nazis before World War Two. All forgotten afterwards. Somehow is an okay man. Okay total crap about the aggression of something, a book on aggression. Totally wrong. Nobody animal er behaviour accepts that, that, that nonsense any more. Yeah, you know is okay, he's an okay name. But erm, Sigmund Freud as you rightly say, a moment there's anything you can see wrong if , certainly happens to Darwin. You can have hardly few weeks or months go by when you see some, you know er, latest lunatic disproof of Darwin, you know, appears in the press. Everyone says, oh I know Darwin was wrong. It's almost always crap. The latest book was total crap. I mean it really was. It should never got any, any attention in the press, yet there was all bits in the Sunday Times, Darwin disproved. The reason could be, of course, as you say, that, that people like Darwin and Freud have made really important discoveries and that's why nobody can leave them alone. ,,basically crappy people, crappy people. And do you know, so what, so what, you just forget about that. There've been plenty of people like that, all down history, and plenty of them psychologists,who've had lunatic and silly ideas that everyone's forgotten about. But take the time just to study Oh, surely That, that, that's one of the big, that's one of the big problems. It could be of course, that we're too near to them, because if you think about it, this has happened to most great pioneers in, in science, they were, for the first erm, certainly for the first century, there's often a tremendous er, rejection. I mean take erm, people like Copernicus, er, Galileo and Newton. If, if you look at their work, for about the first hundred years after all of them, their work was widely, er, disparaged and rejected. Then after about a hundred years, suddenly people seemed to change their, to change their minds about it. Of course, the hundred years is only just up for Darwin and not yet up for Freud, depending on when you start the hundred years it makes a . Erm, the er, there seems to be kind of latency period when great, innovations in human thought are followed by considerable turbulence and upset, and the figure responsible becomes a kind of er, you know bogey person, that, that, that, that people get, get perhaps that's certainly true of Darwin, though I think it's abating now. But er, it was certainly true of er,even be true of people like Einstein, you know, the tremendous anti-Einstein ruled particularly in Germany which denounced it. It was Jewish and so on, and because Einstein was Jewish and therefore he had to be more Jewish science and erm there was a book published called fifty against Einstein. Einstein's comment was, one would have been enough and as usual of course, Einstein was right. One would have been enough, if they had any good arguments or data which er they didn't have. I erm, I suppose this is, this is a phenomenon of human history. The trouble with Woodrow Wilson, of course, is if you want to get some, get Freud, well, this book is very handy, because as you've seen, it does solve all your problems. My guess is that in about twenty or thirty years' time, it would be reprinted and people would start to re-think, oh well, perhaps this is not so True. But, but in writing historical erm, analysis and, and biography, presumably people, I mean, people can't help er writing, writing history, and trying to answer questions, like, why did Woodrow Wilson erm, not the fourteen points through, and presumably, one possible explanation is the kind of Freud Bullett approach, and presumably if you can find erm, relevant data and if you convince, and if you can convince that that's plausible, it's a legitimate thing to attempt to do. We are not saying, that necessarily it's the right thing to do, but it seems to me people are going to do it anyway, aren't they. People are anyway going to try and look for,lo look for explanations, and it may be that, you know, in fifty or a hundred years' time, peoples insight into, into Freud's findings are different. And this is my personal view, as you know I think that people see, er, Freud completely differently in fifty or a hundred years' time. Possibly because Freud himself, you now, was misunderstood. To such a large extent some of the things were misunderstood that he discovered. And when people see psychoanalysis in a different content, then they might look back to things Freud and Bullett studies, and say, well, perhaps it wasn't so amusing after all. Erm, the sorry one thing I was going say before we finish, because is our only American here, and since Woodrow Wilson was a great American. What's the, what kind of impression have you got from, er you know, from your education and, and er and trying to, focus at home about Woodrow Wilson? How does he seem today, by America? Does he, is he regarded as a great figure, or Mm. Erm, he is erm regarded as in terms of erm,he tried so hard and just Mm. Yeah, Right, be with you in a sec. Yeah. Yes Yep. That's right. That must be the, that must be the consensus Yeah Because I asked in the other classes, three or four American students, and I asked them the same question. It's very And they gave the same answer The history erm, you know America,history of very interesting and erm, Oh, really, oh are you? Er Between the wars, and you didn't know this that erm loads of the history that I read here in Britain very different from the history Yeah. So they, so do you think there's a tendency for Americans still to kind of idealize Wilson, but for Europeans to be a bit more cynical. Well, I think not that they're afraid not to be but Well, I think they have a lot to do, quite a lot to do with it. obviously, that erm, I just think that I don't know, it, it's very different from . Mm. Whereas God is not always really always the truth reality Mm. Yes. this is history that you really believe it. Sure. Yes. But, at the same time, you should go some place else To get a different view To get a different view, and yet I it's been very interesting it's been very interesting you know what I mean, you know, always. I nearly cost her a and she don't know. That's true, that's true, yes, sure, yes, yes Not fair. It's on a personal level Yeah, yeah. Well, it, it's just coming up to three, er, well done. Congratulations and apologies. As I said I won't do this next year. Not unless the book comes out again. Can I remind who isn't here. Right, if you see tell her Yes,. Now if you see tell her how much we missed her. Er, next week we're gonna miss her even more, because she's supposed to be doing the paper. As we'll see another if this was a black book of Freud's, and in some ways you would say this was one of the blackest. The other blackest, other blackest book is on next week, when we shall see Freud, erm psychoanalysing not Woodrow Wilson, but Moses. So don't miss it folks. And certainly, make sure doesn't. Thanks. Erm,I've managed to write an essay or two, would you Colleagues just before we er commence with today's business, one or two announcements to make. The first one is that I, I've received a number of complaints about colleagues smoking in the, in conference. Are you taking that line because you're in favour or opposed to it ? Anyway, it's not a matter for us I know, that er depending on where you sit in conference you can have difficulty seeing the no smoking signs, but I've every confidence you're gonna take my word for this. Normally, normally, when it's switched on there's a sign up there. It's not switched on yet, so can somebody switch it on. And equally colleagues there is also, it's true believe me, and normally there's another one up there, a no smoking sign so please be restrained, if only to help me to get through the week with my voice which is usually very bad! Er, the other thing is of course colleagues that the doors at the side are, are open for very good reasons and I mentioned yesterday from time to time that once we get er we get talking there's a that goes and colleagues at the side of Congress have a great deal of difficulty in hearing and listening to the debate. So please if you feel the need that you need to speak to somebody, please go out of the Conference. Discipline has been very good indeed so far. Thanks very much. Now just another couple of things colleagues. You'll remember yesterday that we had the collection for the Crawley Strikers and that the General Secretary, rather, I was gonna say foolishly then, generously er said that we would double whatever was collected. Of course after he made that statement he didn't realize that the London Region were gonna put a thousand pound in the bucket! Yes but such is the life of mice and men. Anyway, the collection realized six hundred and thirteen pound, plus the thousand from London. That came to six hundred, sixteen hundred and thirteen and that will be doubled by the C E C. Thank you very much. Colleagues I've had a message from the strikers at Crawley and they've had to return. They want to place on record the generous support that they've had from you and for the , yes in a moment, the seconder of the emergency motion for er moving her support. They've been out a long time colleagues, seventeen weeks. I spoke to them yesterday afternoon after we broke. They appeared to me to be as committed as ever to winning that particular dispute and I'm sure you would wish to send your further best wishes to them colleagues. One other matter before I ask the General Secretary I think our colleague might want to say something after the General Secretary. Erm colleagues who attended the Blackpool Conference last year will recall that there was, that we had a visit from a young boy called who was the son of one of our officers and that er was suffering from I think I recall a very severe form of leukaemia. I know that some colleagues are aware of this but sadly recently passed away and I must by the colleagues in the Midland and East Coast region er to thank everybody who put into the er the collection on behalf of the . Very sad colleagues, but thank you very much indeed for that. Can I now ask the General Secretary to say a few words. Well just colleagues about the Burnsall dispute erm er clearly and I'm just anticipating the views of Congress that since we adopted a particularly way of making up the er Dispute Fund, I think we should certainly adopt exactly the same practice in relation The point of information President Mel Lancashire Region President, Conference. I see on the agenda this morning that an invitation has been extended for to come along and speak to us. Can the General Secretary give this Conference assurances that predictions about operations that can or can't be performed on. Okay, now one of the predictions made is that metaphors to, sorry idioms to form into this plus. That might turn out to be wrong, but that wouldn't impugn the other data the stuff about, er proform substitutions and particularly erm the stuff about reflexive pronouns and polarity items, yeah, that's why it's not, it's not actually crucial. But of course if, if you start, if you find that the other evidence dissolves as well, then, then you give up eventually. Yeah, the whole sentence is, is a constituent itself er it and can be a constituent of larger sentences obviously. It's just that it's the yeah. It just can't be, be the, I mean if you think of all the, I mean like say you've got a, a, a sort of er cockney expression for if he's got syphilis might be something like you know Johnny Rotten's kissed him or something you know, there must be things like that, you know, there must be loads of things like that. You know, there must be loads of things like that. I mean that just sounds like familiar you know, I mean not that Ha? No, Johnny Rotten kissed object. Yeah, but it's what you're standing in, in well Yeah. The subject and verb stay the same the object subject and verb by themselves which Well Johnny Rotten kissed That's it, yeah Yeah, and then the idea is the verb you plug in there, whatever then you plug in there is fine. You then get a grammatical sentence and means this person. syphilis You're right, it doesn't sound odd, but then the question is why does this all really occur? It does really occur, I'm sure if it doesn't sound odd, it must occur If it doesn't sound odd, you'd expect it to occur. I'm sure it does. I know that. Yeah. how would you We'll be just like T two with no one and anyone reversed. Yeah, but Yeah, but the, the claim is that anyone needs to be licensed by the C commanding trigger which is no one and the point is that erm anyone will then not be C commanded by no one, because no one is too far down the tree. Erm but notice if you stick an if in, you have if anyone saw no one, then I'll be surprised,that does actually make sense. If nobody saw anybody yesterday I'd be amazed it's fine because if is the legitimate trigger and it would C command no one. Okay, erm, just carrying on quickly it's very hard to see how you could account for erm the stuff about reflectives and the polarity items if you didn't have the structures of the kind you get with T one and T two on verb phrases, erm and the reason's just erm you want that kind of a symmetry between say Florence and herself between their positions in the tree and no one and anyone except you can't reverse them, things like that. If you had less structure as in T three which is a ternary branching tree, instead of binary branching be just an N P B N P, it's real hard to see how you can account for the data. You can try it of course, you can try and use erm linear ordering and things like to explain the data just turns out often these doesn't work. So now point seven. Neither semantics nor logic requires V P structure, a priori, that is there's no particular reason why you'd expect verb phrase structuring in particular from either of those two enterprises, because either could get by with er either the flat structure Florence teased Dougal, that's the structure in T three three separate constituents, or teased Florence Dougal where teased is one constituent and Florence Dougal is another which is the way we most standardly do it calculus and that works fine. So erm, if you're looking, if you're looking for semantic structure, which is any structure such as and you then provide interpretations for parts of sentences and rules are getting sentence meaning from word meaning in the structure, you can get by with crude structures that don't discriminate very much and the same applies to logic. When you do syntactics, you get finer structures, more detailed, more complex. So now, what are the relations between them erm we talked about the logical bit last time, but about semantics and syntactics and point eight. Well here's an actual hypothesis to make, semantic structure just the syntactic structure. Why? Well, A, this would be an economical and elegant way for our knowledge of language to be organized. Syntactic structure does appear to be suitable for semantic purposes, one can develop compositional semantic rules that apply to syntactic structures. Basically because in syntax you get all the structure you need for semantics and some more, which doesn't do any harm. Now, suppose you are designing a language learning and using machine you really wouldn't want to have separate levels of structure for syntax and semantics. It would be pointless it would be messy it would be inelegant and it would create the problem of the relations between the two, you'd have to have transformations to get you from one to the other. So the first thing you'd expect on just by the false but enormously appealing principle that the world is simple and elegant, is there is just one level of structure there. It's a terrible thing actually, because you always pretty much er once they work, once they to the data and people still worry about it, why have rather than some other. They it's simple, it's nice, it's elegant and it's not an item at all unless you have a further premise that the world itself is simple, nice and elegant and you have no reason to believe that at all, but since that applies across all sides, I think linguistics is in no worse shape. Okay, secondly and more importantly eight B the idea that syntactic and semantic structure are the same, or rather that semantics just works over the syntactic structure, erm that would help solve the acquisition problem. Remember the acquisition problem infants acquire language on the basis of minimal evidence, that's called a poverty of stimulus problem, which I talked about a bit in lecture one or two. It's just it's very very very well, put it this way, children seem to learn language very very very very quickly and they've got very very very little data to go on when they learn the language. small number of sentences number that they come out understanding and that's rather mysterious So to explain just in general terms, you're interested in describing language in such a way that it's the kindest thing that's easy to learn, rather than hard to learn. That's the basic idea and the fact that we do actually learn, becomes less mysterious. So now, if syntactic and semantic structure are the same then both kinds of evidence, both semantic evidence and syntactic evidence will, will constrain the choice of structure. One of the things the kid's got to do learn his language sentence and in the context he can figure out what the sentence has to mean, like radical interpretation kid, the kid is sitting playing on the floor, a rabbit's bounced by and the mother goes . Okay. Erm, the kid's got to figure out if it's going to use that to project the other sentences then it might come across it's got to, it's gotta decompose that into structure. Right. That's one of the important tasks. Well, if there's only one level of structure then evidence about the and evidence of that meaning are both going to bear on that. the same structure. If there were two levels of structure, the task would be much much harder. Okay, so language would be much easier to learn if this hypothesis were true, rather than if it were not true. Er, for example? More or less yeah. Yeah, Are they a related meaning? I mean Yeah It might just be a case Yeah Yeah, obtained, just they're just photographs. Words that are spelt and sound the same just like and How about identifying the normal and identifying the philosophy? Erm what's that going to find the philosophy say? identify it. Er, well as in the English you'd probably say if you didn't study philosophy, you'd say were identified as Venus, but it's not the same thing. Er, yeah. It's just I mean as philosophy just very standardly takes words from ordinary language gradually gets a technical meaning, er which is different from the original meaning and then when ordinary speakers use it in the original meaning they get told off. Er, that's I mean, I think if you really, in these cases you have to count them as different words just like I mean maths and physics doesn't mean what maths used to mean in English. Energy certainly doesn't. necessary Necessary er all those things. It's hard, I mean it's, it's difficult to tell, difficult to decide when the meaning has actually changed it's a notoriously hard problem, which nobody really knows how to solve in the principle way. Nevertheless sometimes it clearly has and other times it clearly hasn't, so there does seem to be a line there, even if we don't yet know, we certainly have to draw it. Mm. Erm I don't know if I mean remember that in order to do any compositional semantic theory, you have to assign structuring. Remember the little truth theory that we did in lecture two or three, or when you do semantics in logic by swinging two model theories, when you interpret the expressions of a logical language, you have to assign a structure and, er the claim here is just that the natural language, that structure, structure that the semantic interpretation rules apply to, it's just the syntactic structure. Is that okay? Yeah, It does, I mean it's it wasn't clearly formulated until er about nineteen sixty eight I think by Gilbert Harman Davidson Davidson kind of claims this in semantics in natural languages which I suggested that you read, but Davidson puts the claim the other way round, that is there's no more syntax than that structure needs in semantics and that's just false, that's just false because you're not going to account for all the data I've been talking about, about verb phrases. Semantic structure? Er, yeah, it doesn't really er But Davidson actually makes the claim that you to assign no more structure than what's required by a truth theory just to get the coming out right. Don't ask me what truth theories. Okay. Davidson says, I think he actually claims all you need to do is, is to develop your compositional semantics to get the truth theories coming out right and that's the only notion of structure you need. He doesn't really, doesn't seem to have room for his idea of having independently motivated syntactic structure I don't know why cos simple idea, but I think But is it true about the semantic structure where you can say it hasn't got a verb phrase yeah. then the other one still has to have the equivalent of a C commanding although it's in a, in a different way. But you wouldn't have C command, I mean that if you take the first structure in seven, that's just the one in T three. Okay so now suppose you have Florence as the first noun in T three and herself no do it the other way round, suppose you had herself as the first noun and T three Florence okay then you'd find Florence does C command herself but it shouldn't Erm, Oh, right. Er say if you look in seven you've got er, say the . Yeah, that's erm actually, there's that's this structure Okay if you said the first one was saw, Mm. and er and the last I believe there was herself then er the middle item has got to be a particular type of item. Yeah, erm And it's then related in the same way as the C commanding er in fact Florence does C command herself here. Yeah. So that's er on the other hand, erm it would do if you also, if you'll reverse them herself Florence which would, which would presumably be herself saw Florence structure, but that's Yeah but that's ungrammatic . Yeah, but that's what I'm saying there's So that you'd have to you'd, you'd have to, well you don't, you don't because the thing is you want an asymmetrical relation between Florence and herself, because Florence or herself is okay and herself or Florence isn't. Here it's symmetrical. Yeah. Now, you, you could have the linear ordering that's an alternative proposal erm, but then you've actually got erm you've got to come up with a kind of proper account of these structures of how they come about and of the relation and then you've got to check it out against all the other data and all I can say is as it happens, I've tried that and it doesn't work but that's only and we want to find out if you can see that the quite a long way. So I mean by, by all means don't take any of this for, for granted. Yeah. Well you have to you have to decide if that really is structure, it may well be that it's a structure structure is the other way round in which case Good morning. Good morning to you. What happened to sunshine? I don't know. You might have arranged it better. How many lifeboats are you going to land on today sir? Well we're going to have two. We have this one and then we're going further south and operate with the other, the second one. What happens now, now that you are winched down? Well the aircraft, simply do an orbit, come back around, back into wind and then come winching in under my directions using hand signals. Th the only thing I mentioned to the crew is to be aware of static, there's a lot of static electricity at the moment. So er just er let me handle that. Okay? Yes, thank you. Kieran , winch man on the Sumburgh coastguard helicopter, and the rest of the duty crew that morning were winch operator Terry , pilot Norman and copilot Tim . The honourary medical officer of the Longhope lifeboat is Dr Tony , and he would normally be assisting casualties to be uplifted, but that day he himself was to be winched up from the lifeboat to the helicopter, and once that part of the exercise was completed and he was back, safely on deck, I asked him, How was that? That was great. Absolutely You enjoyed it? lovely, it was a bit of an anticlimax I thought. I mean I thought I'd be absolutely frightened out of my mind but erm no. I think you just have a philosophical attitude, if they're going to drop you, they drop you and that's that's What did he mean when he's saying the static? Static electricity. Yeah. Well it's like getting out of a car on a hot day and putting your putting your hand on the door, I think. But I didn't feel anything. The only thing was noise. Have you done it before? I was involved a few years ago in the in the Lance, the rescue er That the lance went ashore on Hoy and er the helicopter there took the casualties of the Lance and dropped Yeah. them onto the lifeboat. Was that a soft landing you had back there ? No , I got a very sore Yes. Dr Tony , honourary medical officer. Once the exercise was completed satisfactorily, the coastguard helicopter duly saluted us and flew of at speed to rendezvous with the Stromness lifeboat. The Longhope boat, the David and Elizabeth King, E B, is a solent class self righting lifeboat and has been on station since nineteen seventy. Once she was safely winched back up the slipway into the lifeboat shed, I spoke to some of the crew. Firstly, Jack , coxswain, since nineteen seventy. Are you going to be sorry to see that boat go? Och well you have to shift with the times, and the new boat which is much faster will be a great help. Have you been out with the helicopter before? Yes, quite often. We've been exercises , this is the third exercise with the helicopter. When was the last called out? Not on exercise with the helicopter? That'll have been the trawler run ashore on on er Pearworth Gareth and we were all come ashore on but it wasn't er . I think that'll been the last helicopter. Have you worked with that helicopter that was on exercise today? Well er everything, Navy helicopter from Lossiemouth, we were out with The big Seakings? Seakings. We're were out with before. Yes, we're never out on an exercise with the Jackie , coxswain of the Longhope lifeboat, who was awarded the R N L Is bronze medal for gallantry for his part in the rescue of the crew of the Ross Turn from the Taft Tail of Swona in nineteen seventy three. The new Longhope lifeboat will be a forty seven foot tyne class, fast slipway launch. She'll be a tonne lighter in weight but very much faster. I asked the mechanic, Ian , who'd looked after the David and Elizabeth King, if he'd regret seeing her go? No I'm I'm really looking forward to getting the new lifeboat, because I think it'll be a great advantage from the station here. At least we'll have a lot of speed, The show a big advantage and a bigger speed, er out here. Have you had any problems with this one over the years? Oh none at all. It's gone like a dream, it's er I've had no major problems with it at all. It's just been a good boat to us. Really. But you are going to be sorry to see that one go because you've looked after her for so long. Ah yes I have looked after it for ever since it was new and er and it was the one that reopened the station after the boat's lost here, but as I say you've got to look forward and I think it's a good idea to to have a new boat here. Cos it's a good young crew, and everybody's pretty enthusiastic. Ian , mechanic. Billy has also been in the crew since the David and Elizabeth King came on station. And I asked him about that particular morning's exercise with the coastguard helicopter. Well it's like what most exercises are, it seems like a lot of nonsense but actually when it comes to the crunch, you actually know what's going to happen, you know the the procedures and everything like that. So that it's it it has certainly got a lot of value an exercise like that, even with entirely good conditions. How many exercises have you done with the Sumburgh coastguard before? Oh we've done two or three, we usually do one Well er I wouldn't regularly but probably one every year or you ken something like that. Today it was winching. That's just what they usually do for an exercise, there's no much You cannot actually simulate an actual rescue so that's the best you can do. But the conditions today weren't exactly calm anyway so it was a pretty fair exercise. Well I suppose but er you can imagine a lot worse than that. Billy . And the rest of the crew that morning were Billy , second coxswain, John , assistant mechanic, Jimmy and Vincent . Also Angus , who was the youngest on board that day. Well I'm not actually signed up but I'm going to start signing up now as a crew member. I just go out on exercises now and again, fill in for somebody. You have a relative though, already on the crew? Yeah, dad, he's the coxswain. And I also have a brother that's on the crew. Have your family always been involved with the lifeboat? As far as I've been told and remember, Dad's always been on the boat, yeah. Different boat. Will you going to on the new one? Will you be here when it comes, do you think? Yeah. By that time hopefully I'll be signed up as a crew member. Angus . And my thanks to all connected with the Longhope lifeboat, for my day out. I spoke later to Jackie , lifeboat secretary, and asked him how many of a crew he had to call on at any time. We now have fifteen men who have past the medical exam and the board of trade eyesight test and are now fully enrolled lifeboat crew. There is one or two not quite completed training yet. There's a great family tradition, obviously, in Longhope as there must be in every Orkney and Shetland lifeboat . Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah the the crew seems to evolve. The the father would be on the boat, and the son would, as a young boy, would come to meet the workers that came back and he begins to help with the ropes and the winching up of the boat and the washing down, and so on, of the boat after she's been on service, and so on . And as the years go by and the father retires the son comes on to the boat, so it is really a very family thing, the lifeboat service. What particular memories have you got of this lifeboat? My memories of this boat would be mainly the the big rescue she did and the Taft Tail of swanal Aberdeen trawler Ross Turn. Was ashore in a cleft among the rocks there and the the lifeboat had to turn in a position that was just about twice her own length. The crew were all clinging on to the side of the trawler and the last men off, Billy and John took 'em They got hold of them by one leg and they pulled them off. And the lifeboat was able to turn and to get safely back out again. Which was really quite a rescue. I out there the next day and all that was showing above the water was the mast. Wee bit at the top of the mast of the trawler. She has sunk by that time. My earliest memory of rescued people being landed by the lifeboat would be in the nineteen thirties, see. Going down with my dad who had been president of the lifeboat here for about fifty years, to meet the lifeboat as come in with survivors, I was just a wee boy at the time but I remember the Icelandic trawler, the Geyser and one of the first to be put ashore off the lifeboat that night, was a wee lassie, and she came across the pier and she came to me, because I was the only kid down there that night. And er maybe about five six years ago, a parcel of blankets came from Iceland for the Longhope lifeboat, from this same woman, and there had been no contact whatsoever between the time she was rescued and then, which was amazing. Have you heard from her since then? Never never heard from her at all since then. But it is the R N L I it's something like a huge club because er go where you like, you're always received well among the fishermen and the shipping people. And so I've quite often been in Stromness and somebody said to me, how are you getting home tonight? You see? As much as to say, well if you need a lift home, just let me know. So it is It's a marvellous thing really, the R N L I. I haven't had time to get it up on the machine to change again quickly but I've had a quick look at the situation with regard to the five per cent increase. Yeah. So the saving that we were going to make them, by reducing five per cent but increasing the lancer machine bearings and bumping this standard cost one up to well as it turned out, seventeen per cent margin. Yeah? Mhm. Would would ta make that three thousand pounds. Which is the one we've just been talking about. Yeah. And so we were going up from that price to that price. That's what I wanted to do. That's what you wanted to do, you hadn't discussed these with them. I've mentioned it to him and what he's saying is come back with a firm proposal. Obviously what happened then this was before This is because this was the dead stock that we sent him. The tools I wanted to get rid of. Okay. Yeah. It's changed really now because of the fact we pulled Yeah. we've got more of a leverage so we Yeah. need to re-look at how we Because he's mentioned straight away, as soon as he was in the mire Right. well you know, the five per cent reduction you know, don't worry about that at the minute and and all this sort of thing so Right yeah. it it does need another Yeah. looking at. Basically what if we do increase to that price. Yeah. On the machine build that he's given me for this year, of which that is an example. The two arrow machines use it and there's a hundred and two hundred and nine machines altogether Yeah. Mill which will have three of these one each machine. six hundred bearings pairs. Six hundred and thirty seven to be precise Right. yes. Well the difference is about six hundred and seventy two pounds. You mean the increase in prices. Yes that's how much extra it'll cost him. Yeah. Er we've run up a cost of two hundred and fifty quid getting . And the rest and the rest . Well this is this is what the point Yeah. I think now's the time. I want to try and get it done, bearing in mind Elaine's going to have to have the baby on Friday if she hasn't had it before. Yeah. So will more than likely be off next week, but I do want to try and get something done with this and some of the other accounts, I want to try and get them out the way before I Right. . Now what's the the how have you calculated the five per cent erm reduction? Is th is that because all Yeah. these are down five per ce No that's not it. That's down five, that's dow er that's up That's up. because it's the lancer machine. That one's up because it's the lancer machine. It's just those two that'll have gone down by five per cent which are the sabre machine bearings. Right. Okay? So what's that five per cent negative worth to us? Well what I what I did here, to work it out so I could come up to some sort of value, is I said I haven't had time to chuck these back on the screen yet to start again Yeah. but this is where it got to when we talked about it last time. Er is I'd looked at the using their machine build which I've built in , Yeah. on the sabre range, the lancers and the arrows, Yeah. it would mean that is the price that they would sell at the nineteen ninety four price volume. And that's the price up to that one. Yeah that's it, the first five lines. So you're going for a five six to five nine, thirteen nine to fourteen six, thirteen seven to fourteen five. So that that's the saving effect, the difference between those two is the saving . Yeah, that is the saving that they would have made on each of those builds . So we're talking there about I'll I'll do it on the computer but Savings savings of whatever this is, it's three hundred erm that's er seven hundred, that's a thousand . Er thirteen seven that's eight hundred, that's eighteen hundred. That's a big one isn't it. About fifteen hundred. Er that's three thousand three hundred forty eight machines you see. Right, so another sixteen hundred there. So so that's four or five thousand pounds that we're giving to them. Right and and by putting these prices up on the lancer and that I was actually clawing a couple of thousand pound back off them. And that's I was trying to put myself in the position of before. Still offering them a three thousand pound saving. Yeah. But helping our spread if you know what I mean. Yeah? Right. Now it's a different ball game because we I think we have an opportunity to maintain that price for a while. I mean i it's it's where we feel we need to make the emphasis. This is based on full full year isn't it. Yeah. Erm one of the things that er would be nice to end up with is a price on the books which is the higher price. Yeah. So that the price we want to end up with on the books is is Mhm. that one, that one, that one Yeah. that one and that one. Yeah, now well this is That one e erm I mean I'm a I was just I I said twenty pound O six, it was a quick calculation, it ends up at seventeen per cent margin. Erm you see it's it's balancing that between the fact that we don't Mm. But we're s we're gonna be charging it approximately twice as much as would. But we've helped him. And I think we've got But but but we're only charging twice as much as would erm because are providing a standard bearing. Er well selected for their standards that we think is the only way they could do it. Yeah. Although, understanding the way, volume manufacture and I would say they've probably if they've got similar production facilities, got a very good chance of producing good stuff anyway. Along the lines of , there's a very good probability they'll just take Mm. it straight off the line knowing that it's coming in. We we haven't got as precision. So what's the advantage of of our product over theirs. Nothing really. Think of one. Well er . There must be some dimensions that have been more thoroughly checked than than er Well no because I c I can't say exactly how 's applying their product. They could be doing it on a Yes well ninety per cent of them will be P five. They could be selecting them off the Yeah. line. Yeah if they if their churning out the stock that tu tend to churn out, I mean I go along for an enquiry for a few and find they've got thousands in stock. You know. And you think, Bloody hell, well I'm not surprised they can guarantee getting P fives. If I had all them to choose from, I could guarantee it. I don't know how they're achieving the price. I mean they're they're s they were something like twelve quid a pair. Yeah? Now John says he he can only imagine that they're selecting them out. But then again, John's a precision man. Yeah. Yeah? So you know, coming to terms with how manage to do what they do, you can see it's probably actually not too bad a price to charge when they can get them cheaper . Yeah yeah yeah yeah. But but we also know that if er select from the end of the line of standard production. They don't select on every feature, they only select on some. Don't they? No not necessarily they could er they could check for all tolerances And I don't know how they do it. This is it I don't know how they do it. It's only dimensional tolerances don't forget. They don't have to test them or anything. Well according to the the P Thanks Carol, the the the P five specs no doesn't involve noise testing. No it's purely dimensional. The thing is,the machine tool industry or super precision requirements be become use and take for granted a noise specification, the fact that it must run quietly. But you can get P Right well that's something that's something that you've got to you've got to differentiate. Mm. Ours are noise tested correct? Yeah. P five does not require a noise test. No. Correct? Yeah. Right so what you're getting from us is a noise tested bearing. Right okay. Secondly er We guarantee P five. We we are we're guaranteeing P five plus a noise level. Yeah. So you're actually getting something that you terribly badly need I put the seed of doubt into Steve's mind about the fact that I could not say that er bearings could be guaranteed P five at that price. I said, the way they're picking them out, I couldn't say that they can guarantee every bearing. Right and and what's the noise test that we put ours through, is that three dimensional noise testing there frequencies and and so on and Yeah the normal . Right, so so what we're doing is a noise test to super precision Yeah. limits. Yeah. Right is there anything else like that pardon me, oh dear . Is there anything else like that which erm er which we do that they may not do. Not really. Cage it'd be interesting to find out what cage material they're supplying. What cage material are you supplying? I've a feeling B E T N. B E T N. Yeah so it's the er cage. the buttress type thing. Yeah . Er okay, so you've got your quiet noise running. Quiet noise . Be sure about the cage. Yeah, it's the one, I'm not so sure what they would supply you see. Possibly nylon. They do tend to have single nylon that's a single strip that just folds round. They do a lot of that support frames. Do they? Yeah, a single strip that they actually just feed into the ring and then put the balls in. So it's not actually a solid ring, it's n nylon thing which sits in. Oh yeah they use that f in in the in the P two class product they have some of those in. Japanese do it as well. they works, I mean you know, our point is we always you know, we've got the guarantee with the cage and that. But er Well okay so so you're going to you're going to erm emphasize the er the fact that what we are supplying is a noise tested Mhm. P five bearing . Yeah. You're going to emphasize the fact that our cage of course is erm a buttress cage Mhm. er out of er Polyamide six six. Yeah. Is it still polyamide sixty six, not . I don't think it's changed yet. Erm Our stocks over there would still be that anyway. And er er and and that that these have er substantial advantages for them and and don't know but but there's got to be an element of doubt. Yeah yeah. Erm and although they may say they're noise tested, erm I think you've gotta question whether they're noise tested to the level. And you've seen our facilities here. Er and and you know how Yeah. how very very careful we are. Mm. So what you're what you can be sure of getting from us is absolutely on line and of course you're getting a service . Right. Erm e mainly it's where do I put the emphasis. I know we've got a lever now, yeah, we're gonna get rid of this in other words, Steve's gonna give us something for it. Yeah. Yeah, it's identifying where we want to get it. Now okay, I know what you mean by saying yes, you want to get the higher price everywhere. But if we took the highest price of everything then we're making thousands and thousands and thousands. Now Yeah well presumably we're reversing this position. That's right, we've got to balance that with the fact that we did promise them a decrease, but we've got the erm leverage of having helped them. So if we've got Well hang on hang on, hang on. I'll tell you what we'll do. I'll tell you what we'll do. Yeah. How about we leave the price as it is. We'll we'll we'll leave no no we'll no no we'll leave these these prices here which we were gonna reduce, we're gonna Yeah. leave them as they are. Right. But we will give them a five per cent reduction on those prices wh for deliveries between March and September. So we're giving em it for six months. We're giving it for six months. . That's worth two and a half thousand quid. Yeah. Mm. Er June to December he'll say. Alright June to December but that's Yeah Just easier you see, cos he'll say the then for when we do a price increase next time. Cos if you go back up in September, it's higher for the increase next January. Well that's exactly right. . But but at Yeah okay but at least we've got the price on the table. Maybe we don't increase it next January. Mm. Maybe we leave it where it is, but at least that price is on the table. Right. Whereas anything else we do, we've got to fight ou we've got to claw our way back to that . I'll tell you what then, we've got the two options,we've got the one area of this five per cent where Yeah. we don't want to give em it for the whole year. Yeah. And I've got the standard cost here I need to get up. Right. Right, now erm I want to get that up first. Yeah. I want to make profit on one size rather than er Yeah. Yeah, keep it on others. Yeah. So how about if I look at the six monthly saving, Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I look at what that is in value, about two and a half thousand, I'll look at this one, Yeah. I'll put a reasonable price in there, I see what that's gonn I haven't managed to escape there, I'm glad just to get on the pitch. Now erm, I haven't been to a match lately, but these pictures I've seen, there's still all these fences around to stop people doing that. Erm, what is the situation in our own stadiums? Well we don't have fences,but erm, we are the regulatory authority but the County Council are the regulatory authority for the sports venues. The Fire Service have the delegated authority for them and the situation in our local sports events is quite adequate. There's work that needs to be done, in most of the major sports grounds, but that's proceeding and there's, if you can imagine that there's, in Shrewsbury for example, a lot of the work which we would want to be done on the grounds have been less than enthusiastic about doing, because they're likely not to be there for very long. But, and I have no concerns about sports ground sale, we've regulated the numbers because they had some concerns about the and that, that itself has caused 's fellow supporters some problems, but we've actually restricted the number of people who can use the sports ground. Right, so they're game heavy you think? I wonder if it's free to them Only people that the gate can know the christian names of are allowed in. I have here a comments that there wasn't any point in really restricting the numbers. I think they'd have three now as well as David. Councillor ? I'll, I was just going to say, Chairman, I, I too am very concerned really about the number of premises where it is advisory to the District Councils, or advisory to . Bearing in mind the number of private nursing homes that spring up and erm, er, I mean the sort of privately run places er, presumably the local authorities have to give them a licence to run, but is there no way that it, can the Fire Service, can our officers go and make an inspection? Clearly they have no power to do so, even if somebody asks them to, somebody from outside for instance, erm, and, and also when they do get a fire certificate, is there a display for it? Or stuck in the back of an office, or, or could they have something sort of glossy like the half kingdom Tourist Board stars, that they can put on their windows,to let people know that at least that particular nursing home or whatever establishment it is, has been duly inspected by our Fire Services? I mean, otherwise one assumes simply that people don't know. Mm, well th the answer to the first question is that, no we don't have any authority to enter premises like that, where we haven't been invited unless somebody has identified a potentially dangerous condition. Section ten of the Fire Precautions Act gives me the power to inspect any premises where we believe there is a threat to life, other than domestic premises. And there are certain circumstances in which we can do that. It also gives me the power to prohibit or restrict the use of those premises until those conditions are alleviated. In that document, there is a very strong reference to the fact that that power should be either restrictive or removed and that there should be a right of appeal against it, which would effectively prevent us from using it. In terms of nursing homes, we don't issue fire certificates anyway, we only issue certificates to offices, shops, building premises because they were under the Act, Hotels and Factories. So a nursing home, hospital and school, residential or otherwise, is never certificated, and any advice that we give is exactly that. It's not mandatory. That surely is is, is of quite concern to people in some way registering whether a place is considered safe or not. It's through Social Services or the Area Health Authority. That is there responsibility? To keep the place from the Fire Authority as from others. Yes, mm Yes, but they've got to have a, you, you've got to have a, you've got Leaving, leaving, leaving aside their er,ob sorry Chairman. Yes, I'll come back to you, sorry. just mention what I've heard, the only statutory job he could do, is apply his licence in . Is the Fire Officer given every individual case where they apply for a licence over an old people's home, and er, this sort of thing? Oh yes. And can't you keep it, keep the Fire Officer when the home's licence er, if they don't carry out statutory duties as required? We, we, we, I suppose it'd be like two levels, that in the majority of cases we could say we recommend that you do not issue a licence. Social Services are really a help, we could choose to ignore that, I have to say that I'm not aware of that happening, and I think it's very unlikely. Because it would be a very dangerous thing for someone to do. The other element is that the county's are so dangerous, and that's actually quite unusual, they're so dangerous that we consider they present a risk and it has to be me that considers it presents a risk to life, and I can either restrict the use of premises, but I can prohibit the use entirely. But as I say, this says that,an that's a relatively new and certainly draconian power, and it's recommended in this document that it's removed. Please Yes Colonel Is this, all these wonderful protection of animals, dogs and horses and so on, and pet shops and so on , do, does the Chief Fire Officer think in his local knowledge, that most of these have been inspected by his officers, or does he get the feeling there, that sometimes the district councils are not asking for these inspections? It varies a great deal depending on the district council. What I have to say really, is that most of those premises present very little risk at all, and, and I think that any change in the implementation of fire safety legislation should be based in prioritization. Now that's something that's difficult for us to do, because the more dangerous, the more erm, the premises should present the greatest life risk, are not necessarily the ones over which we have strict legislative control. I mean for example hospitals and nursing homes, we have a purely tenuous control over, whereas we have a very rigid control over a signal box on a railway. Now a signal box on a railway presents a fairly limited risk to life and a nursing home presents a fairly dramatic risk. Yes Jim, or Chairman, if, if someone doesn't come under the regulations and is operating a business or something of that sort,is there the facility for that body, either the management body or the business to ask voluntarily for you to inspect, with a view to issue a, er, erm, a certificate er, erm of er, safety? There's no If anybody wants a fire certificate and we had a recent case where a notable local solicitor asked us to issue a fire certificate and we refused, because his premises does not require one, or did not at that point require a fire certificate. Then he subsequently moved one person from the ground floor onto the first floor, which meant that he did require a fire certificate. But if it's not required by law, then I cannot issue, and if people ask for advice we are obliged under Fire Services, the Fire Services Act to give that advice, but what I'm really saying is that with the, the pressure of work on the Fire Safety Department, it's likely that if it's a fairly low risk to life, we'll never get round to it, and that's the honest truth. That's on your statutory requirement? Yes So what you're saying is, that if people er, if people's consciences state I ought to try and do this, but I'm not required by statute to do, the chances is that A, that you, you can't do it anyway, but B you wouldn't have the facilities to do it anyway, as well. We, we, we will normally get round to people. We do inspect . But we probably don't inspect and give advice to people who'd like us to, because they're not a priority, and we don't have the resources to do that. A lot of interesting points come out there, haven't they? Cap If, if, if I could summarize, if you could bear with me by saying that, there is no embracing legislation which covers fire safety, and there is no legislation which actually prioritizes it. What we have is picking up a ragbag of stable door legislation, that came out of other Acts, and that's why we have offices, shops and railway premises from the Oswald Acts which were neatly tucked in the back of Oswald's Act. Hotels which were in the first days of making order, and factories which came from the old Factories Act. And the cost, or the potential cost of designating particular, like hospitals and similar premises is so prohibitive that the government has chosen never to implement the designating orders for them. And I hasten to say it, governments of all persuasions assume it must be being done. Someone move the recommendation? I will Yes Five point seven, paper J, Fire and Rescue Service Training. Different board is the outcome of the P A G inspection? Yes, it seems it I don't know, Mr Chairman, I think you've always been very keen on this trend and supported it fully. And, I, I will support this number seven, seven with recommendations. Thank you there We are moving on reasonably well on this issue. Yes, well we've got to Reasonably well, yes, reasonably well Then I hesitate to say that there's probably a more complex issue now even than the Fire Station, erm,the figures which are given incidentally are the original estimate there, because that was what was available to us at the time. They have now been varied slightly but they make very little difference. A question that's already been asked of me, on appendix C, up at employee at the largest single figure there is a hundred and thirty seven thousand eight hundred. That's not a way of fudging some other cost, the retained fire fighters are recompensed when we provide training for them, because they normally have to lose work or whatever. They are very, very expensive to train because of that. We train whole-time fire fighters cheaply, but we pay the retained people compensation for loss of earnings. That figure is the majority, the majority of that figure is compensation for loss of earnings. That's the trouble, you get cheap service from retained personnel, but they're incredibly expensive to train. But absolutely essential. That's the only time you pay loss of earnings? Yes If they've taken off for a fire two days or something? They're going to get paid then. We pay them for attending fires. The only other time they're paid compensation for loss of earnings, is when they're sick as a result of an injury received on duty, you know Fire Brigade duty. Well this recommendation's been moved, seconded? Yes Five point eight, Emergency Planning Are you going to speak on it or not? The recommendation's here. Chair, here. We move There is one thing, and I think I did take it with you, erm, Mr Chairman, I'm with the erm, I've forgotten what the question on, corporational liberties, the thing that is concentrating many of our minds quite some , but the er, would, would the Chief Fire Officer like to? Yes, well he s he did take it up with me as a, er, I mean you did take it up I didn't complain, I didn't complain, I suggested it. No, but what, what I'm, what I mean, what I said such as emergency services. Now the emergency services are police, fire, and erm, and ambulance. There's a fourth one actually, but everyone knows who they are So those do cover the police. I mean, if the police and the ambulance service. Could, could that just be underlined perhaps in, by rephrasing it slightly to emphasise that, because I, I think that I think we all know what emergency services are We, we know but You don't, I see we, we do, but there's no harm, in view of our knowledge and experiences just to put that phraseology in a little bit bolder. I, I, I, I think Mr Chairman what I, I think I explained to you what my concern was, that we have cases where there's a serious road accident, and erm, and the road is stopped, we have no real authority to turn traffic or divert traffic, but the, the police are the only ones that can, and if we want to get down in, in, into an emergency very quickly. I, I mean it's only by the good will of the police that we can get down there and that,, this is, this is my concern Mr Chairman, in, in theory what I would like, if there was a serious emergency, you'd get a senior officer in here straight away, and I mean he would negate to the police, we have no authority over them, only cooperate with the police. And that's my concern. Well I, I I, I, I mean they're, you, you, I mean they're very good, but they do, er a lot are imperfect, a law unto. Oh, oh, I think all it wants is that paragraph rephrasing and with more strongly emphasis but, on the lines on with that. That's all I think Chairman, I don't suppose that er, you'll disagree with that will you? Well I, I wouldn't disagree with it, but I, but I, the description is perfectly plain to ensure that effective arrangements are established from liaison between the various departments of the County Council and the appropriate organizations such as the emergency services . I know what the emergency service is, I'm sure everybody else does. There's a fourth one that keeps cropping up on television but I mean we don't take that into consideration. But it's just police, fire and ambulance services, those are the emergency services, I can't see what, what the objection is to me making the paragraph stronger. No and I can't see wh no well I, we made it, I'm not against making it stronger, but I can't understand why this suggestion has been made. Well because of past experiences, Chairman, that's all. Let's make it strong I'm not criticising anybody, just make it stronger. Chairman, I, I, I'm really confused now, I mean they've, they've got me, they've got me talking about semantics here which is ridiculous. What we're talking about is the emergency services that sh that responds to the needs of those who are in difficulty or in distress. That's what we're doing and I can't see anything here that prevents er, total cooperation between A the police, B the ambulance service and C the fire services. I agree with you entirely. I think this is er, semantics, and simple nitpicking. The police have never, I mean the Fire Officer will tell me, has there ever been an occasion when the police have not cooperated with the Fire Service in an emergency situation? No No, no there's always room for improvement in liaison Come on we're talking about the job, the job description, really they're there to please, er, er, this is written by one, one man and er, or one woman, and we're just saying that the wording could be improved in that one little phraseology, that's all. On the job description. It was put together by, it was put together by the Chief Fire Officer and the Chief Executive er, not just the Chief Fire Officer. Right. I'm saying it could be improved, I'm sorry. Yes Colonel. Er, most officers would have accepted it and moved on to the next subject. Paragraph two was current solution to see the sort the place where the advertisers as widely as possible, presumably based on the job description . Here, there's no salaries attached to it at the moment. Erm, do we know how big the department's going to be, because that governs the salary? Where are we in relation to the sort of catch twenty two situation on this? The, the salary is stated I, I'd rather finish with the other question, or, or the made by the Major in the press question, are you, do you want to follow up the, I mean, have a vote on this if you want to? No Or is, or do you think the wording is suitable, or do you not? The wording's suitable. Yes I, I, I'm dead easy, I mean really it's a bit pedantic being pathetic. Leave it as it is, leave it as it is Leave as it is, and move on. Right now,c yes sorry, well we'll go back now. The, the post is currently graded at P O five, not P O six. After the exclusion of the public. Can we discuss after the exclusion of the public. Thank you sir. Yes Clearly er, it's er, again in, in paragraph four, under future budget of er, the services is going to be critical, if you've seen the last couple of years that are defined in the pay, and that's going to continue. As far as the short-term is concerned, er, part of the budget package in the current year, er, the retirement and the, the now proposal was to, to help up the side as regards that. Now it's referred in item one of the introductory paragraph, in the introduction about additional funding, and I just wonder where is the total for this additional funding? Is it from within the Public Protection Committee's overall budget, or is from elsewhere? If so, no. Well if we're going to start to go into funding, I'd rather this went into the pink paper session, and that we have our Chief Executives down here to explain that situation. I don't want to discuss this in open committee. Agreed? Yes. We'll put it as the last item. You have the situation Personnel, five, point one, sorry, five point one three is that right, so Er, five point nine I think Chair. Five point nine, optimistic, I'm getting terrible these days. Just a little bit optimistic,straight through to that, Yes, avoiding, oh yes, yes, yes, sorry, sorry. Avoiding, now What Future for Local Emergency Planning, National Conference. Now, I'm, I might have been remiss on this, but we had to do this in a hurry, erm, to get names in, and, but it's been suggested by erm, the leader of the er, Conservative group on, on this Committee, that erm, a, a, member from each should, major group should go, and er, I'm quite, I'm quite inordinate, in favour of this, if we can get erm, bookings there now. I'm, you know My feeling is Mr Chairman, it is an unpolitical er, erm, we're going Oh yes, yes into a new ground and, and er, I think it would be very useful if, if we yes, yes, I'm quite happy, providing we can get the erm Erm, I think I, yes Chairman, if, if, if you're prepared to attend that if you're saying that Providing that they're not all taken . No well that's, that's impractical and all, but You know it's, yes, yes. I don't know where it is. Okay are you all agreed? Yes, agreed. Are you going? Who's on transport? I don't believe this gentleman. We'll check, we'll find out before the end of the meeting. Thank you for our er, I've got a better one than those Five point one oh, annual inspection, am I right now? Yes, ten We know that Mr Chairman. Five point ten, yes. Erm, you're all aware of that? Five point eleven, Fire Safety Week, well that's gone past. It's quite useful We played on a different part Five point one, twelve, Brigade Festival at Cowes, an absolutely superb evening in my opinion, but somebody said it was bloody awful. Er, Well I think it was a marvellous evening. I think it was I can think of one c comment Chairman. The, they ran out of er, of carol sheets. We didn't expect c It,i I had the initiative in getting a prayer book, er, er, a hymn book from the back which er, after some concentration with the index or something, to er If you would pardon me on the sheet , it's a shame Mr 's not here, because that was his decision, because of the imposed cut in stationery from last year, we ran out of it Come on, come on Good for him. So he was others? Oh yes yes er I should say that er Street er Street then you get into Palfrey now you see Palfrey was a little bit less due to the fact that there were a hell of a lot of railway men at work down there, I mean really all belonging to some department on the railway, you get er drivers and all the men and the permanent way of being in Street I mean a lot of people from Palfrey lived down lived in Palfrey was working in the permanent way in Street, so it was a really, Palfrey you could say was a railway community. Now if you come to Caldmore, you'll find out then that the majority of the married ladies had worked in I mean I should say that erm I know my mother was very snooty she'd been an apprentice to some dressmakers in Street and work for one year for nothing she always used to tell me, and she was quite er toffee- nosed about these girls that used that er that used to go, well they were very respectable people, and when I was a kid when I growing up in my teens a lot of the girls I used to know were in the offices at er it they employed about fifteen hundred people at in those days you know I mean coming out of at night it was fighting your way against the crowd if you were going towards it, and the same thing going through the square for people who have worked in when they left that's why all those shops in the square used to do reasonably well, it was the people walking through to go up the other side of Walsall, but there was a crowd of people I can, I can always remember as a kid a crowd of people and then there'd be well you can tell it was along Street in those days I can remember fruiters' carts where the girls used to go and buy apples, and that all sort of going along there you know people used to wait for them coming out, these are my impressions as a kid I mean I can remember the, the er and the men of course were cutters and various people and a quite a lot of my father's friends were, were er had er skilled jobs at as cutters and managers of the cutters' department and that sort of thing. Then, then of course there weren't no traffic signs in the middle of the road, it was a sort of er certain people from went and started that up and er they were all wor all worked in Caldmore it was almost as though the tailoring Caldmore was full of tailors in a way then there were people starting up on their own making clothes, but er there was quite a lot of tailors around er I know there was he'd got a shop on Caldmore, he was a tailor and er shall we go through all the shops? Yes. Well we'll start off at the top of Road and on the one side there was the furniture people they used to make furniture. Did they make it on the premises? Oh yes they made it Miss has just died erm then coming down there was the Post Office with old Pa and the, then the Miss , they used to keep the Post Office, then there was er well there was a gents outfitters and then there was a beautiful shop I always used to think, it was called, another , but it was confectioners, but it was all most delightful old oldy-worldy sort of shop and my mother often used to go in there then you'd Tell me a bit more about that shop then. About that shop. There was a Victorian air about it somehow there were, there were quite ladies who'd kept it, almost the same sort of thing as you'd find out in the country, country Ye Olde Elizabethan Coffee Shop type of thing you know, they they'd be the er there was that atmosphere about it and you'd buy lovely cakes and things like that. Then coming on to the end of Street next door was a milliners, now that nobody knows what they are today Miss the name was and then coming across Street to the other side was which was a drapers, and next coming down was Smiths the butcher's shop, and next to that was the grocers, following on down there was the ironmonger, then there was the newspaper, and you come down to the White Hart erm then we come to the White Hart Do you remember anything about that? Oh yes er I think somebody kept it around father's day, a chap named , but it was a beautiful old place and he always, because my father always used to erm start off about seven o'clock in the morning to walk down to Walkers and er call in at the White Hart because they were open at six o'clock in the morning, for a rum and coffee for about tuppence or thruppence, then he always used to er go to his mother's for his breakfast and er he used to go down and see all the men start off and then, then slip over to his mother's, she lived on the Road and er she, for years and years this went on that he had his break he never had his breakfast at home he'd start off going down there and come back to his mother's, but he always stopped at the White Hart for his rum and coffee Did many people go in ? Oh yes yes oh well yes for a rum and coffee yeah, and I'm afraid it was very acceptable on a winter's morning, but erm now we come, we've come on that side of Road, we'll now start at the top of Road again and come along as far as er what I call Street I believe it's now where St Michael's church is, and you come to Sammy the butchers. Now Sammy was a character in himself he was a bachelor and his wi his sister was Fanny the elocutionist er and, and er there the women used to, to go into old Sammy's shop on a Friday night simply to be entertained by all the wisecracks and nonsense that used to go on in there, and somebody would say I suppose you're off this weekend and he'd say yes I'm off to my little widow in Wales, he hadn't got a little widow in Wales at all now but it would the start of the conversation going. My mother's been up there and she didn't come back for two hours and she came back we kept well he'd sold a lot of meat in the meantime. The next three shops was which was a er he become I think in the finish but it was a toy shop and then you came to er the fruiters, on the other side of Street, and you came down to er little pawnshop. I, I shall be seeing the you know in a few weeks time the daughter she's a, she's er Rene that was erm Eddie , who were very big pals of mine and we go to the anniversary lunch together so we're all over eighty but erm you couldn't the bread shop, was another confectioner's shop, and then turning round the corner you come to another shop, up two steps, which was and that was another type of confectionery and shop, then you get as far as the corn and seed people er they used to have a shop in Street as well, and then before the First World War there was the butchers and they sold foreign meat. Fourpence ha'penny a pound this New Zealand lamb was I remember. Mother wouldn't have anything to do with it whatsoever, don't you bring anything, any of that stuff into our house, I mean of course it be this New Zealand lamb had just arrived on the scene before the First Word War, I mean nobody was, anybody dare have it I mean they'd be standing on the pavement at eleven o'clock at night almost giving it away on Saturday night, but anyway that's all changed now, we all eat it. Then you got to er the picture house er that happened just before the First World War that was put up as far as I can remember, I know I used to go there and see erm the Broken Coin which was a serial picture and it was you know er where somebody was up to their neck in water one week and it would say that the continuation of this picture would be shown in this theatre one week from today and you . what was it like inside? Pardon? What was it like inside? Nice, very nice, you went up a long hall toward, as soon as you got er through the doors it was very nice really, quite, quite something for Caldmore anyway. Then on the corner of Street and Green was the tobacconist shop. Then coming along Street you come to the picture frame people and then the Conservative Club, then there was the big house further on towards the top of Street and that was owned by somebody named Winnie , was my second wife's she went to school with her they used but her father lived there, and on the other side of the road you got the toy shop and er the draper's shop on the corner of er Road then there was the newsagents and one or two people kept that, but that takes you from the top of Street straight the way up to Caldmore. Now on Green, now we go, we've come along from the top of Street right along Road, the toy shop then you get to the Kings Arms and on the other side of the road there was another pub and I can't remember the name of it, then there was the fish shop and then the Liberal Club then the pork butchers you'd think they were all full of meat. There were a lot of butchers. Butchers and er then there was the butchers and that was on the corner of and er and and then cross over there towards Street you've got the stores, then you come the, the er drapers, then er Tommy the butcher who was my first wife's uncle and then you come to a shop which was owned by one or two people, which was a sort of er general store and then my mother-in-law's shop a cook's which was What sort of shop was that? Which was a bakers and confectioners, they used to er bake at the, they got the er the bakehouse at the back and they used to make confectionery and high class bread. And what sort of shop was it itself was it a large shop? Oh quite a nice shop, yes very nice shop. Would they display the bread? Oh yes, yes in the, in the window yes I think and many and many a ticket I got when I first got married to my first wife I used to do my mother-in-law's little tickets for all the various custards, and, and Eccles cakes and four for thruppence ha'penny it doesn't of course I could print right you see she said, being a draughtsman I always could print right so I used to do the four for thruppence ha'penny. How much are they today? Well I bought, I bought three custards the other day and I think they were about fifty three pence. Have you got any special memories about any of these shops at all for any reason? Any that you used to go in a lot that you can tell me about? Perhaps for instance. Oh yes I used to go and fetch the er erm I used to go into every week, oh there was the maypole next to as well. I used to go and fetch the, the butter from don't bring margarine my father used to say we put better stuff on our machines so er I used to go to for my father kept foul, I used to fetch a peck of, bushel of this and a bushel of, you know all the various things that, bran and stuff for the foul yes, yes and I believe a lady, she has, she's only recently died and but she kept it for a long long while Elsie her name was. And what was it like inside were ? Oh yes, sacks of other and they used to have a proper corner seedman's shop, which you don't see about today the er Garden Centre has knocked all that on the nut hasn't it really? What about chemist. Whereabouts was that? That was er coming down from Street you come to then you come to the grocers and was next- door there that's the only link with Caldmore as it used to be and Caldmore as it is now Maybe because it's still there. Yes probably yes. And what sort of shop was it in your day when you were young Michael? Oh quite a nice shop. I used to know, I used to play at tennis with Bay , the daughter and er the eldest daughter she married another chemist and he ran the place afterwards I think, then there was Jack but er I, I used to know, I used to know quite a lot of the er people on the, who kept these shops. Was it the sort of chemist that erm was it the sort of chemist that you'd go in if you'd got something the matter with you and rather than go to the doctor, they would sort of dole out something for you? Well I've never had the experience and I don't think my family have, I er no I shouldn't think it was really, they might, I suppose somebody, they used to have a reputation at one time these chemists was doing minor, giving you something for some minor ailment, but I wouldn't care to sort of er, I'd never think of it, no there were quite a lot of doctors about you know, there was er Doctor at the top of Road and there was Doctor , Doctor oh there was a lot of doctors about. Were you sent to Sunday School when you ? Oh yes rather. Which one did you used to go to? Well my mother was one of the pillars of the Palfrey church and er she er oh I went, my father never used to go, but she used to go and of course I, I used to be an altar server down there when I got a bit older I did for a week or two to the erm do you know anything about an Anglo-Catholic Church I mean where they swing the incense and there is this little boy with the boat? I was that for about, I soon got fed up with that job. How old were you when you did that? Oh about eight, seven or eight, but when we first went there the honourable S G W was the vicar, fourth son of the Earl of and er, oh you he was there then afterwards er Father came, and I used to do altar serving oh I was never interested in it you know I was forced into it. Who forced you into it? My mother I remember there was a sale of work going on at Palfrey church once and bef I had just been made apprentice at Wolverhampton and of course I got amongst the, they, when they came the, the Derby day they were all having a bet on it so I, I said to the give them half a crown, so he said you can't have half a crown and he said what do you want it for so I said they're putting it on a horse was on this horse it won, so of course this sale of work was in great progress when I gets off the train at station and thought well I couldn't understand in er Palfrey Church Hall, so she was there in all her finery and I said we've won, we've won she said shut up, shut up she said but erm no I think the biggest character in Caldmore was Father . What do you remember about him? Oh I don't, I just, I remember that er if you walked down er Road at night you'd see him with his mortar board on and his curate by his side coming down to to post the letters, and then when all these ladies were in Sammy shop one night being entertained by Sammy erm Father and his curate went by, and old Sammy turned round to the audience and said well if dressing up will get him anywhere they'll be on the first row in heaven. I was there that night I was, sometimes when I was a little boy I used to go with my mother you know to, for the ent I didn't know whether, yells of laughter used to come out of his shop. I'm trying to explain to you that there was a different atmosphere about it, the whole situation, I know they were hard times, I know that some people had some really rough times but it didn't show very much, and when I come to think of all my parents' friends I don't remember anybody having a wife bashing episode or they all seemed to be very contented with their lot somehow except one, and that was a little bit dicey when I was a little kid, but the man died and the Observer the next week the er obituary notice was put in the paper and underneath they'd got, with Christ which is far better and my father said and they she couldn't have said anything better words Do you remember anything more about Father ? Yes oh I ee I, I'm led to understand that he, he built that church and I'm led to understand that at the same time he started, he came as a curate to St Matthew's and then he came to Street into a house and he had a little, he started a little church down there in a private house and then he built the church. He very wealthy, but oh dear dear he was a, he was a, tyrannical I should call him, I know for a fact that he used to before the choir walked in at night he'd have his watch out in his hand and they'd start at exactly the same time. I remember when he always used to read out during the service before the sermon the previous week's collection and it used to consist of the collection last Sunday consisted of one pensioning note, twenty ha'penny half crown pieces, forty florins and he'd go all through the coinage down to the last ha'penny but erm oh I believe he was, he was er very aristocratic, very aristocratic, but er Father , cos he used to come over our house quite a lot when my mother was on the parochial church council, and er he had a curate that was quite leftish and he got himself on the old Board of Guardians and of course he used to sort of er go into the Labour Club and was quite of er father, he said to old Father one night he said erm he's a funny chap your curate he said well he , he's the son of a farm labourer he says and I'm the son of a country squire and that's the difference. So that was the attitude hey, but erm they'll have me up for libel here. Tell me about some of these other characters around, can you recall anyone? Well old was, was er absolute er you'd never think anybody'd would buy anything out of his shop, er my father went in for something once and he, and he said you can see them hanging up can't you, I mean er salesmanship was on unheard of as far as he was concerned they were there, why ask him if he'd got any, but erm course you must remember I was only a little boy I mean I can remember all this, I took it all in but I wouldn't say that I knew them er I knew Miss , from the grocer's shop she was a Sunday School teacher, and er the Sunday School used to be at Road School we used to have a Sunday School there and a Mr used to take this. He was another character er there was er I remember they used to have a lot of socials and things at the church you know, it was very well attended I suppose in those days. Don't know what it's like now. What about the Conservative Club and the Liberal Club did they, were they more social clubs? Oh yes, er yes they were, they were er of course there was a great divide there I mean between the Liberals I mean they were the only two parties in those days. The Conservative Club was there before the, the Liberal Club. I think if the Liberal Club was only like First World War it wasn't there it hasn't always been there but the Conservative Club was there as long as I can remember. Do you recall any of the activities that were associated with either of them? Did what? Do you recall any of the activities that were associated? Well I was in the tennis club when I was a er they used to have a tennis court at the back. Which club was that? Conservative Club, and my wife she wa we were both members there oh and there was a, I tell you another shop that probably I haven't mentioned, just before you get to the White Hart there was Thompsons the butcher's shop with er they got three or four er daughters I remember. Why do you think there were so many butcher's shops? there was a lot of meat I suppose really I mean erm answer. I mean were there sort of different quality meats being sold all the rest were No difference No of course one or two of them had slaughter houses at the back of them you know. I see I mean er Which were those? Well Tommy used to slaughter all his cattle and er you see my father-in-law's bakehouse and his slaughter house were next to one another an open yard at the back of the shops and er How did the cattle arrive? Oh driven up from the station from the, from the goods yard oh yes. Was that in Street Walsall or ? Yes a long street or somewhere around there, and yes I mean many oh many a time I've, you'd see ca every Wednesday night you'd see the cattle being driven up. Always the same night was it? Yeah, and one got stuck in the, there was an entry between my father-in-law's shop and the next one and one of these cattle ran down the entry and got stuck in the entry, you know it was only narrow and the they had to shoot it, but er oh yes it was a, that was a thing you never hear of today and you never hear of people putting tannin down when people are ill do you? You see Walsall being a leather town there was a lot of this er bark tannin as went and when anyone who was ill so they wouldn't hear the noises of the horse driven vehicles going by they used to, for about fifty yards each side of the house they used to put this stuff in the road to deaden the sound. Do you recall this being done? Oh yes. And what, where did this happen that you remember? Oh I've known it happen all over Caldmore. So it was a regular happening? Oh yes they put this, this tannin down it was like a bark I don't know what it was cos I'm not in the leather trade, I, I don't know much about it except that it was some by-product from the of the er tanning process, and they used to put this stuff down when people were ill. So with you mentioning leather then it leads me onto another question erm was there much done in the way of leather work in the Caldmore area? Oh rather yes, out-work, people used during the First World War there were no end of people were sort of er especially if they'd had a bit of experience in the leather industry like harness and saddlery and that sort of thing, especially the harness and er other work attached to leather cavalry and er revolver holsters and that sort of thing, they'd do them at home you know oh yes there was er now Walsall's divided isn't it? It's got leather and, and iron and steel, now you come onto the Road and you wouldn't think there a leather factory about would you? Because from top to bottom it was all connected with iron and steel the whole lot all the way down. You go from er Hopeworths, Mason and Burnhams, John , Gill and Russells, Walker Brothers it was er a terribly industrial, well you could fi Road used to be all granite sets in the road, there wasn't the, because there was so much traffic went up and down er it was all made of granite sets when I, when I was a kid, but my, shall I tell you what I used to do when I was a kid for my Saturday morning? Well first of all I'd go down Street and up Street West and up to the top of Street and there was some puddling furnaces, the new side iron works and I'd watch those men they'd produce wrought iron and during the process the metal boils up and I'd have to get a big rubbling bar and rubble they'd call rubble into a ball, there's a little wagon put underneath the put under the wagon and off he goes to the steam hammer, now I used to be fascinated with this and Saturday after Saturday I used to go up there and watch one of the heats and as soon as they'd finished doing they used to go into the Forge and Hammer for a drink, I mean it was such hard work so they'd do a heat go up the Forge and Iron and come back and then do another heat when I'd How long would it take to do a heat? Oh I should think it would be the best part of an hour and er then I'd go along Street down into Walker Brothers call in my father's office. Can I go in the rolling mills? I used to go into the rolling mills and watch them rolling steel sheets and over about half an hour there, this was Saturday after Saturday after Saturday I used to do this. I'd come along Road and up Lane into Street to a shop that had got rabbits in the window. I used to walk along there to see these rabbits I think the name was and they, it was a barber's shop that had got these sold all sorts of pet things and that I used to, then I used to come home that was my Saturday morning, but I always used to go in up to the news line. Now the funny thing about it, when I took metallurgy I got, I, I got all this process I knew all about it you know, and er I had it the theory explained to me then, but er I was in the Bell one day about twenty years ago and an old boy came in and I started talking to him and he says, I bet you don't know what I am? I said no I don't, he said well what I was anyway he said I'm retired now. He says you'll never guess. I said well what was it? He says I was a puddler. I said, were you? He said you don't know what that was, that is do you? I said I do a bit, so er he said, well do you know anything about it? I said a bit, and I never let him know, I thought I'll wait a little bit until he go so he says to me, he says I bet you don't know why they put the damper in just before they'd put the, bring the ball out do you? I said yes I do, he says you know? I said course I know I said to put some of the carbons from the smoke back into the, into the er wrought iron, he says how did you find that out? And I told him that er all about it, but I said do they make, do they do this puddling these days, he says yes at West Bromwich they still do it, but er they used to do it up on Do you recall what they used to wear? Moleskin trousers. Were there any protective gear of any kind? No no just the used to wear like a, a pork pie hat. Did he wear anything in par No no no no not that I know of. Did you see them load the furnace? Oh yes they used to put pig sc iron and scrap in it. Pig iron you know er pig iron was what they had I've seen them pouring furnaces pouring it onto the pig beds, and you know when I was a kid when we lived in Caldmore from about half past nine at night all across West Bromwich, Wednesbury all over that area, you'd see the sky light up and it was due to the pouring of er pouring the pig iron. They open up the these blast furnaces and the, we'd all be in the open air and the reflection there used to be quite a reflection in the sky all round there. Did, getting back to Caldmore. Erm were there any small workshops around doing odd things you may recall, sort of small set-ups? No I don't think there were, there might have been one or two, yes I do know one that used to make some form of er something for the saddlery trade and you know those houses opposite the alms houses in Road, there are some alms houses on the one side, then there's some houses that lie up steps on the other side of the road if they're still there. The back of there there used to be one or two people who used to have little outhouses where they used to sort of make things, and my grandfather up the Pleck, he was a good locksmith and he had his shop at the back of the house and he cou he could watch the Walsall races going on, which is now where the Road is, from his workshop before Street was put and any of those and he could stand in his workshop and watch the races. And when would that be? Oh oh in the eighteen nineties I should think eighteen eighties, eighteen nineties. And did he have any men working for him or did he work on his own? Yes he er he had a nephew for part time but he was a now he was a Wolverhampton Grammar School boy. His two brothers both died with smallpox cos one was, they all three went to Wolverhampton Grammar School and they were a Wednesbury family and they died with the smallpox but I thought they were putting the youngest which was my grandfather for the best trai one was going in for law and the other was going in for medicine, and the youngest was go which was the same as engineering is today I suppose, and he went into the gun trade, and I can remember him, he was a grand old chap and er he used to come and bring the springs that he'd made and to temper them he used to throw them in the kitchen fire, and they'd die out and get them all out of the ashes in the morning, and he used to take his week's work in his waistcoat pockets and his day out was to get on the tram at the Brown Lion, and go straight through Wednesbury and right through West Bromwich up to the Constitutional in Birmingham to Greeners or Wembley and Scotts and he'd got these gun locks as he'd made during the week in his waistcoat pockets. They were very small then? Yeah. That's interesting. Yes and er my mother was frightened to death of guns because, oh he was a bit of a boy at heart I mean you can just imagine everybody used to bring the sporting guns to be repaired and there was guns floating about all over the place, and my mother was scared stiff of guns right till the time she died er, and he got mixed up with all these sporting connections you know like go off to shoots and various things and I think he did a bit of cock fighting in his day as well, but I've, I've got the exercise books that his two brothers. Do you want to see them? You can show me? I can show you afterwards aye you can have a look at them and see what you think about them. Erm yes aye that's the Pleck that's not Caldmore you know. Yes yes but very interesting all the same. Yeah oh yes he oh and he was erm being better educated than the majority of people in the Pleck he used to stand outside the Brown Lion to read the newspaper out to them cos they couldn't read, and he attended all the weddings, all the funerals and er made the wills out and he almost was the father confessor for the Pleck, and when the old steam tram came off the lines down in the Pleck, when there was a steam train coming through there, he was the man who put it on the rails again. What was his name? John . Tell me about transport through Caldmore when you were a young man. Do you mean public transport? Well both sorts. Non-existent until about I shouldn't think there was an a bus did come to the bottom of Road, I can't remember what was, it must have been about nineteen twenty I suppose something like that, it used to go to the bottom of Road and turn round there, but I never er my mother always used to say you'd ruin the trade, the trade down well I don't believe it did really er now I think the lack of transport now you've hit something there, lack of transport there encouraged people to shop in Green rather to go down the town cos you could get anything off Green you know, you just think you'd ju you, you smiled about the er butcher's shops, the grocer's shops, the cake shops, you could get the gents , you could get anything on Green the ironmonger shop, you needn't go anywhere else but, when they started transport er yes I think the buses had quite a bit gradually cos things that, you don't think get things happening in this country overnight I mean, they grow on you don't they? I mean you get a bus coming as far as Road and back I don't suppose it has half a dozen folks on what's this thing coming up here, nobody I'd er I've walked into Walsall all my life and but gradually the whole thing changes doesn't it, and then the thing gets off as far as West Bromwich, and in, then, then there's through traffic and then how far and the Green's not big enough to take the turn around up Road then they change the direction, and it's all done on bit by bit by bit and so Green's got eroded it's er So they took bits of Green away then? Oh yes they did for, for the increase in traffic I mean that er that er went on over the years gradually creep, creep, creep on until the whole atmosphere of the place was er I don't know improved should you say or not I don't know whether it's er well it certainly hasn't improved but erm it changed, it was such a lovely little place really, and of course you could run across the road whenever you liked I mean we used to play in Street of picking out in a sweet shop window er a name be Cadbury's or chocolate or something you'd be standing across the road and you'd be running backwards and forwards backwards and forwards, there was no sign of anyone getting run over cos there was nothing about, and when I was a kid going to the Bluecoat School I'd run across that bridge every morning without looking right or left, because if anything had hit me, well nothing used to be coming you could see a tram coming but oh there was nothing else at that time in the morning oh no it was, wouldn't like to run across today. What about private transport in Caldmore about this time, how was, what was that? Do you mean somebody who owned a er some kind of vehicle, tradesmen some of the tradesmen did but not many that I can remember, no I don't think there was too many of them. Would private individuals have their own transport? No no no no there was nobody, now er probably up at the top of Gallway there though one or two would have er stables I should think, one or two of those houses, but by and large no I shouldn't think so. Now there is another, another part it's very nice and that is round Lane and er Road and all round there used to be very nice at one time. Do you know it? Er I can't er Were there any open rural areas? Oh yes. Yes my playground. Go up Road, and from there turn down Follyhouse Lane the continuation of it and you'd come right to the Dales and nothing at all from there to West Bromwich, and you could see, if you go over one stile from one field then onto another and then brook that now runs through the Road there, that used to be a little country brook that run across the golf course and there was a little stile over it, a little bridge and a stile, then you go straight up to Dells common and not a house in sight. Was it open farmland? No , cut straight across it. I mean that's what cut straight the way across that it was, it was all and my aunt she used to live by All Saints West Bromwich, we never used, we never went to see them we used to walk it down the road past the Boars Head onto the Navigation Inn, and up by the Sandlow and she used to live opposite er All Saints Church in West Bromwich, and erm coming back we should come back round midnight you know and er have you ever heard of the Whirly Gang? Yes. Has that come up in your er in your well we were coming back there one night from my aunt's and er there were quite a lot of policemen about and I was only a little boy, it was before the First World War and my father said to one of these policemen, what's happening so, oh we had a tip-off he says that er there's these Whirly Gang folks and in the morning we saw somebody'd been maimed or killed, but er that was another bit of interesting news around, and I remember down in Caldmore one day there used to be some ladies who used to come from, well they used to be, one of them used to call them the salt ladies, they used to come with blocks of salt on a, on a I think they used to come from and I saw a horse there as a kid and I, it had got a long gash right across its body and I said to this lady I said, what's happened to this, she said oh the Whirly Gang and er I was in Paris in nineteen twenty two and er we got to this hotel and there was another Englishman on this trip and he said to me he said where do you come from? I said Walsall he said oh the Whirly Gang You just mentioned these salt ladies coming round. Yeah. Erm tell me a bit about that. Well all the way from, they used to come from and they used to have some sunbonnets on, I always remember they used to have the, I'm not a dressmaker but you know a la they don't like frills down the back that used to hang down the back and the I remember them coming round selling blocks of salt. Horse and cart? Horse and cart and of course milk was never delivered by, in bottles in those days. I mean that was always a milkman used, there used to be er James was one of the milkmen down Palfrey, he used to come . they used to pour it out of a can you know, it's a wonder we didn't all die of tuberculosis but we didn't. Did anyone else come round the streets selling things? Oh yes the watercress man on a Sunday afternoon and er all the various things were s fruiters, fishmongers, all used to bring their stuff round. How did you know they were in the street, did they have a call? Shout, they'd shout something but er well since we've been living up here, my mother used to give, the man used to come for the order for the grocery, the baker used to come round, the milk used to come round, they all used to come round at she'd ha she didn't have go out for heavy loads of stuff to bring in it was all delivered, but when they started some new technique of er of ordering by computer, it's going to come back to square one again you know, they'll be delivering stuff in the same jolly old way hey. Could be yes. Yes don't you think? Could be yes, yes. Give it fifty years and I'll bet you that the baker and all the rest of the folks, it'll be coming from a supermarket, but they'll be delivering stuff that you've put on your computer. That's right that would be interesting. Hey er well, during, just after the war they started these concerts in the Temperance Hall. Now the Temperance Hall was a very very nice hall er balcony all the way around, it held five or six hundred people er candelabras and all the rest of it, a lovely stage and these travelling concert parties used to come round on a Saturday night, and I should imagine they'd be doing the seasides during the summer and then they came back in the Walsall and various areas during the er winter months, and we used to get concert parties like The Roosters and The Bonbons and all those sort of people come along and they were real and of course fellas my age, I mean eighteen and nine we used to take our girls there I mean it was full of young people er you'd perhaps have been to the pictures one night and it's another way of entertaining really and it was really a first class entertainment. Well my pal and myself we took these two girls and we sat in the middle of the Temperance Hall and he said come on let's sit over on the balcony he says and put up my clothes by the radiator he says it's been raining he says and it will dry them, so we moved, and exactly from were we moved was where the women got killed, just candelabra dropped on her and er when it happened the fella on the stage the comedian was singing, a hundred years from now you won't be here, and I won't be here and from the corner of my eye I could see something gradually dropping like one of these candelabras and I thought hello that's part of the act you know, it was just gradually coming down and all of a sudden, whooosh and the roof came straight in oh and I don't know sure I'd I, everything went dark of course I mean it was all in blacked-out all the chairs were loose, so as the folks wended their way towards the exit doors they took the chairs with them, so they politely threw them back in the crowd that stood in the hall so you were dodging chairs as well as trying to get out, where we were, where we were seated the firemen were hacking at the windows thinking that it was a fire because all the dust had gone up in the air and the reflection of the light from the market I suppose and that would give the appearance of smoke, and he was, I said to this fireman I said there's no fire, he says, he says there is I said there's no fire in here, anyway we eventually got out but I took these girls back home to and I really, it was, properly unnerved us both and as we came on that old tram we were, we thought you know everything seemed to sort of upset us and when I got far more upset on the Sunday morning when I went to have a look at it, the whole roof had come right in, but there were fifty people got injured you know and about, oh there was one lady killed. I knew one of the girls and er she never got right properly again. She got injured in her back somewhere, but er it was national news, I mean it was in The Mirror and all the papers and it became a, for a day or two it was er it was in everywhere, and the theory is that er it was this erm very very dry summer and a very very wet autumn and a bit of dry rot in the timbers somewhere, but it was it was another How long did it actually take you to get out of there? Oh, half an hour. Quite a time really? Yeah, yeah, oh yes of course a lot of the people were, that were in the we were in under the balcony but they were up to their knees in plaster and goodness knows what that had come out of the roof they couldn't move it all dropped round them. So they had to wait to be dug out did they? Yes I've Good gracious, was anyone trying to organize the ? Well you can't in the dark can you really? You can't really, you see we came out into a side door into the old square. I don't know what happened to the front entrance, but there was a basement underneath there and my first wife was dancing in Harvey Martin's dance hall underneath, her pal and herself she, they'd gone to this dance it was a dancing lesson on a Saturday night it was famous in those days Harvey Martin's dance class er yes I Was, was there any damage down ? No no no. In the basement, it was just on the Just on the top yeah on the top of it That's about all I can tell you about that, but er it makes you wonder whether I hadn't better keep out of Street, doesn't it? Ken, welcome back. Could you introduce er the people, your team, particularly as I think one of them has a different name to the label in front of them. Yes, I'm afraid Mike Kirkham has been delayed in Prague for today, so Nigel Spackman, who's a member of our Committee and is a deferred pensioner is taking his place and Les Taylor is the Secretary of our Maxwell Pension Action Group. And you are Ken Trench? I am Ken Trench, I am the Chairman of the Group. Ken, we've you've given us er er er a document in re response to er the Good Committee and your views and so on. We've got a number of questions we want to ask you, because er though you're pivotal to all of our erm activities in this enquiry, we are also looking to a report which is hopefully going to be influenced the Bill the Government brings forward. So we will er if we may er not ask you to introduce your document we we'd like to get on with the questioning. If at the end you feel there are points we haven't covered and I forget to invite you, would you say you would like to make a concluding statement. Yes, by all means. Very good. Jimmy? Well Ken, obviously everybody was abhorred regarding this national scandal of the the Maxwell er pension fraud that er the Committee who were making enquiries obviously were implementing the fact that we should have a report and Goodey was set up and the recommendations that have been laid down as far as Goodey is concerned in order to strengthen the pension scheme so that these frauds can happen again, now have you read the report? Yeah, I've read I don't think I've read every thousand pages of it, but I've, I've I've done quite a lot of of it yes. Mm, having read the report and possibly being on the end of the complaints from the pensioners in the Maxwell fraud er what was your view regarding the proposals that are being made? Well, we feel that there's it's obviously quite a lot of points that are, are very good in the report, but we really feel that it's concentrated very much on the administration of pension schemes, rather than security and I think that whilst if everything that, everyone of his recommendations had been law, I think it would have made it more difficult for Maxwell, but I don't think it would have made in impossible for Maxwell and I think that what th what we see the problem is, is that in many ways the, the Maxwell problem was brought about by two major, major factors I think. One was the failure of the self- regulatory body I M R O and the second one was really the fact that he was able to change his financial year end from April ninety-one to December ninety-one and during that period he was able to do things with those erm those funds in his accounts and er and really there was, there was no check on that, and I don't see that the that was in er Good would have changed much of that situation at that end. It would have made it more difficult, but the way that Maxwell used to involve himself in bulk transfers, you know and move, move two hundred pensioners from there to there and er no money followed and this sort of thing, I think that er that he could of quite frankly done exactly the same thing and we really feel that the, that the role of the pension regulator and the and the opposing role with I M R O that, that you really if we're not careful, we're going to put in another layer of bureaucracy and have a pension regulator who's got the task of of checking a, a hundred and twenty eight thousand pension funds, when really there's probably out of those a hundred and twenty eight thousand, ninety-nine point five per cent of probably being very well well run and, and quite safe and what, what we can't really see in the report is a is a method of identifying the determined fraudster at a at a very early stage, you know and we're just terribly disappointed that er that Good has just thrown the whole of, of the matter back at I M R O who we feel have proved to tha that I don't think they're up to the task, I think that the that the whole question of er of the power of a self regulatory body which to us works on blowing the whistle, you know the whole the whole effect of a self regulatory body is that it's members that it, it's really like a club isn't it, you know and we're all members of this club and if one of us er is gonna do something wrong, then the rest of us are gonna have to pay for it. Well, in the in the question of I M R O as far as it's erm occupational pension scheme members are concerned, er there's no there's no compensation responsibility and I think that that means that you get no, no whistle blowing and in I mean there's, we've got, I mean one of the points that we, we heard of just last evening was that one of the of the banks involved ended up er in its arrangements with Maxwell of asking for a hundred and sixty per cent of shares for every hundred per cent of loans that it made to Maxwell. Now to me that means that that, that city organisation must have been very doubtful about the whole future of the Maxwell organisation when it was getting to that stage, and if one looks through the, through the Writs, you know which now, now number about the same number of pages as the as the Good Report, you know you will get an er a feeling of what Maxwell was doing and how that was all all being happened and with leaving all of that with I M R O we just don't think it's going to er er we don't think it would have saved the position. Ken? Well I think if I M R O I think if I M R O members had had a compen a compensation responsibility or er then I feel that the members would have would have would have allowed certain things to happen. I mean when one starts to, to scratch the surface, let me just give one example I mean we feel er I M R O fails on on its membership I mean the fact that you had Bishopsgate Investment Management which was the beneficial owner was an organisation in Liechtenstein. Now I M R O asked er we understand for the be the management of that organisation to give accounts for that for the c for the senior company to I M R O prior to its membership about a I think was about eight working days before I M R O approved that membership. We we've asked I M R O if they actually got those accounts and what they learnt from the er from the Liechtenstein company and they've told us they can't, they can't tell us it's er it's private correspondence. Can we actually pause there cos you've done a good bit of digging on that one. Er David Shaw on this very I come back to you Ken erm y you've asked some questions, I've actually seen the I M R O letter and can I say that there are two questions in the I M R O letter to Mr Maxwell and Bishopsgate, which quite categorically asked for accounts and also details of the ownership structure coming out of Liechtenstein. I haven't seen the re final reply that went from er the Maxwell organisation to er I M R O but I did see a draft reply. The draft reply contained one threat to report I M R O to the Securities and Investment Board for excessive enquiries er and for an unreasonable attitude and the other er bit of the reply was effectively a form of covering up presenting full financial information and disclosure to I M R O. Those replies were drafted by people inside the Maxwell organisation and you may want to comment on er the position, although I should stress at this stage that I like you have not seen the final version of any reply and I do not know whether I M R O persisted. What we do know is that I M R O asked for this information in June nineteen eighty-eight and not long afterwards I M R O granted recognition to B I M and other Maxwell Companies, all the more surprising perhaps having raised the questions whether the question must come about, did they continue with their investigation, or did they let the matter drop and perhaps you might to comment in that context. Well I think we can all, I mean I think just the fact that they were asking those questions I think literally days before they gave the approval worries me. Ken, but asking the question is rather good, isn't it? Oh, asking the questions is fine. Cos they were actually on to something important. Yes, but I would have thought that you know I M R O sh should of then I asked, I write and asked them the question, I r really would have expected a reply to come back, yes, we found this and so and so, but we then scraped a little bit further and erm. Can I just ask on that Ken? Yes. Do you not think that almost regardless of the reply and whatever that reply contained, with what we now know with the benefit of hindsight about Liechtenstein, which was actually known by I M R O there's not for the benefit of hindsight that wasn't known at that time, shouldn't I M R O have refused immediately to license any organisation that was controlled out of Liechtenstein in those circumstances? Absolutely, absolutely, I think you know, I I mean I just feel there should be a total ban on anywhere where where you can't get the information that you require, you know. So let's leave it there and you, but you were saying Ken, you've scratched Oh, I think the story goes on from there, because I don't think though and this is a personal opinion and I I'd love the Committee to I don't know tha that er I M R O ever did get accounts out of Liechtenstein because a year later B I M the m the ownership of it was transferred from Liechtenstein back to England but guess who the the, the owner was transfer to a charitable trust, so we've got erm a company that is handling the investment management of seven hundred million pounds worth of pension funds which is owned by a charity and the second class citizens. Can you give an example when you say that the law is designed? Yes, erm, let us take one little factor, this question of the agitating the media and the, today, and that is the reduction in interest charges. Now when interest charges fall, the person who is buying the house benefits from the reduction in interest charges, but the person who is renting a house in local authority and then in this case nobody, nobody else in Harlow to rent it from, is faced with, not with a decreased monthly rental, but with an ever increasing one because as more and more Council houses are sold the cost of maintaining that there, the superstructure of the town, the cost of maintaining Council houses goes on increasing and so the burden is laid on the tenants and the tenant can find, will find himself that pound for pound increasing his rent while the house owner is decreasing his mortgage charges and at the end of the day the tenant is paying increased rent, increased rate and with nothing to show for it, erm, I've always been in favour of a sale, of, of property er owner occupiers, but not at the expense of the people who cannot afford to be owner occupiers, ah, to my mind, the present housing system is designed to maintain the existing class structure because even with the large discounts that one gets and nobody's ever yet convinced me that why you should get a discount because you buy a Council house, but if you buy one privately owned you can't get a discount and it, there's, this, this is so utter nonsense, but it is throwing a much heavier burden every time a house is sold on the remaining houses which are for rent, and so you that, although the idea is to make it a classless this society with more and more people owning their own properties the mo the mere fact that the majority of people in the town cannot afford to buy even the reduced priced Council house, is an example that the, the system, the class system a division by income still exists. Yeah may I ask Mrs some more questions? Would you mind answering some questions? Well she's a bit shy, but I'll help her. I wanted to ask you about the furniture. Can you hold it, if you just hold it about, like that, yes. Erm, do you mind answering some questions about your furniture? Oh, well, what do you want to know? Erm, you seem to like modern furniture Yes, yes Why did you choose modern furniture? Well Come in, come in, come in Jon. Morning. Good morning. Is it? Oh aye. I was laying a heavy carpet yesterday, and my Oh right. my chest's full of st It's er gunge. . Was it a s this time of the month already? Aye.. Good? I dunno er are you taking blood cos I've Doctor to see this afternoon. Er it's immaterial to me I mean I'm, I'm, I'm totally unprejudiced. I mean if maybe it'd be better if he does it Jon because he Oh I was Aye. I was thinki no I'm no being facetious. No no no no no no no It's just I'm just thinking. He'll, cos he'll see the results then, Aye. and there's less chance of them getting lost because if we send it over to Monkland and it comes back here, it goes to Doctor , you know how he's all over the place, and he's doing it all day, seeing clinic. as he's got Strathclyde, and he's got er Aye. Stonehouse as well. May be better if he does it this afternoon pal Well that's for, you know for, for the sake of getting the, the, the stuff all in the right place at the right Aye time. Aye aye. But urine test, absolutely fine, no problem there at all young Jon. That's smashing. Got a wee bit of reaction to the Sulfasalazine and the penicillin, mind. Oh right, aye. Er normally thirst. Right. I'm drinking water and and tea That's okay. That's alright. Anything. Coffee. Anything at all. But that's about the most I had. I started off at the s at the start I was er I was getting mouth ulcers, and then well I didn't get them to the severity that I got them with the sulfasalazine That's Er funny, cos sulfasala I've been s I've certainly been using it for years and years and years with different folk fo er for something completely different. Aha. I mean it didn't come for, come out for arthritis. Arthritis , no. It came out for something else. And I've used it oh, for about thirty odd years. I never found anybody with any trouble ever having any trouble with it. And yet when folk got it for their arthritis, okay? Yeah There's no trouble with er with the Sulfasalazine Aye. So there should be no problem. Yeah, that's right. Renal problems and er I was having bowel problems ulcers in my mouth. Mhm. That's right. And I was quite amazed. Eh? Oh aye. I was quite amazed. But er if you . said you know? Aye. But er I was away for a week there, I only came back on Saturday. Good, good Er did you get to? I was away up er Nunkton Kildray it's between Invergordon and Paine It's not my part of the world at all, It's beautiful don't know it , I don't know it , is it? Oh. Oh, right. Right aye. Oh So my w Jessie and I had a wee break. Peace and quiet? Aye,we we've been having a lot of trouble with the people next door, and er Mhm. it, it's really quite amazing. Oh . I can believe it. Erm trouble with neighbours is Well it's not unusual in . I hardly think that I'm able to run about banging doors at four o'clock in the morning. It's I'm up a I haven't seen you too often . I'm up against the six footer, and a five foot ten wife Aha. er and you know. having a that's what it's . That's right, that's right. Thanks . Okay. , Jon. Right. Bye. We need you in a semicircle and the best way to do that is to push your chairs roughly around that grey line There's a nice swivelly one Erm you pass those round in either direction, from now on it's, it's bandage time. Denise is going to do bandaging and I'm going to do bandaging and so are you, so you have these packs and these packs, if you'd like to take one pack each, I don't know if there's a pin in them, you might find a pin in there please look after them and bring them back each day, you'll find a bandage and a roll of bandage in there and so their your own properties In your text book you've got quite a lot of information in there about reinforcing, what we're going to do in the practical session and it's always a help I think when you have a lot of the, thrown at you to know that you can just put it up and there it is if you get a bit confusing or can't remember what's what, so on page one six nine it starts telling you all about nursing and bandages and general hygiene which we've already talked quite a lot about but it's very useful for you to know, you can go there and look, and if you just go through the pages from there on one seventy, one seven one, one seven two, one seven three and then on one seven four it's got the general rules for applying bandages apply bandages when the casualty is sitting or lying down, you always sit your casualty down and you work from the front of, I say why do you work from the front of the thing? So you can keep So you can see how they're looking, see if they're going pale a bit or if they're going to fall off their chair and talk and reassure them. That's right, erm always make sure that the injured parts are well supported bandages should be firm enough to do the job and large enough to cover the wound all of this is the sort of thing which you need to be referring back to if you're in any doubt. On page one seven five you've got how to check the circulation, after you've put the bandage on to make sure it's not too tight, it's not stopping all the blood supply, press a fingernail if there's only a finger nail and the, it should go white of course if you press it, then the blood should go back and it goes back pink again or an area of er skin, always check your circulation after you've put your bandage on. Now when you've actually opened your pack you'll find, what you got your triangular bandage here. Now I'm going to show you now how you going to put it away again, fold it, afterwards, opening it up alright, everyone open their bandage up? Now when it's opened it's useful as a sling, two sorts of slings we're going to do, high sling and the low sling but also if you fold it, it's very useful as a bandage too, if you put it across your knee, then you bring the point up towards you like that and then again, fold it the base up to the top again . and again face up to the top and there you've got a bandage, okay? One stage before that you've got a very broad bandage which is helpful for supporting things, we'll learn about how to use that later. When you've got it to the final fold there you've got your ordinary fold bandage and if you want, pack it away like that, you bring the end in the centre, there, so and again the ends in to the centre, just so that they meet like this, like this the centre, just so that they meet there, again, start like this, ends just to meet in the centre don't overlap them too much and again bend into the centre and you've got a nice little pad, if you ever need a pad for plonking on a wound quickly, there you've got a pad, or putting against an ear or anything you want it for and you open it up quickly and you've got a bandage, two of those and you've got a but it's a very handy way to keep. When you've got your bandage in your pack, I've explained to you before, you open it up in the first aid kit it's sterile, yeah, you open it up by the one hand goes one way, one hand goes the other, break it open, put the cardboard away and you need to be ready to try before you pull the next bit off don't you because as soon as you've opened that it's not sterilized any more, so you open that up and you find, unwrap it unwrap it as I showed you before with the first aid kit, comes out first and then you see how the padding because this wadding is stitched onto the back, and the front is the bit you put against the wound and you put it straight against the would without or touching it and that pad should be big enough to cover the wound, so you should something, overlaps, alright, and then if you find, if you unwrap the roll a little bit further, you don't want to unroll it completely, your see that if while you're using it in practice you need to roll it up again backwards towards the back of the bandage like so, we'll roll it up again, backwards and when you get to the bandage you just fold the bandage up around the long end and wind the short end round it firmly and there it's ready for use again in practice, you wouldn't of course do that for real would you? Put away, use another one. So that's how you look after your bandages and all these things that we're going to show you you'll find in those little sections in your first aid book so if you get confused or why you've only got to look up in the book. Let's do the sling first. I thought we'd do the sling first, high sling because it's very important to get it high and not pull it, everyone, anyone gets asked to do the high sling in their exam and if you can put a good high sling on you're halfway to passing Mm and from that it can't be bad can it? So I'll be the casualty and at the moment we won't worry about all the various things you use a high sling for, we just want to make sure that you can actually do it, okay? Can you just come back a little further and then they'll be able to see, better if all round the side Okay? Right, now then, be like this I'll pretend that I've done something that needs to be, a high sling to support me in this fashion. And I, I'm going to be working from behind Denise because you all need to see, but you would be working from the front as I've already talked about, so you need your triangular bandage, alright, and there's your long edge, and there's your point as we call it, a sort of elbow shaped, think of that as elbow shaped because it always goes towards the injured elbow. Now, that when you arrange your sling in the first place, it's crucial to the success and ease of which you finalize the bit round the elbow. You arrange it so that this long side is vertically up and down the body, right, in that direction. Don't let it come across like that, the temptation is to think that you've got to have all this bit up here, now you don't want this up here because it's very difficult to cope with once you've tied it round to get it round the elbow, you want the least amount that you can get, just cover the arm and then it makes it much easier to deal with at the end. The amount at the top that you need is just enough to tie a reef knot oh I've forgot to show you a reef knot didn't I? Tie a reef knot. We all use a reef knot in erm first aid and again it is in the book a very good illustration in the book reef knot and then nobody knows how to do it, I will show you in a bit, but that's enough to do a knot, the knot comes on just above the fingers, in the hollow of the neck, okay? So that's how you arrange it like that, the first thing you then do is to tuck the spare bit under the hand, cos the hand then there anchors it for you Okay? and the hand doesn't sneak out afterwards and starts popping out and then it's useless, then the rest of all this stuff you just get it out of the way under the arm, it's all gone, right, this bit comes up between the two shoulder blades, don't make the mistake of bringing it across there, a lot of people do that, that won't do, you have to come round the back and between these two shoulder blades to get maximum support, you've got to hold this elbow up and then you tie it near the hand, now I recommend that you tie it and talk to your casualty, half tie it and say is that supporting you enough? It feels okay thanks, yeah Cos then you can draw it up a little tighter if it's too loose, if it's like that and, most people do it too loose, is that tight enough? No it isn't. Right I'll just draw it up a little bit tighter, is that tighter for you? Better, better And now I'll do the other half of my reef knot, right, and tuck the ends in immediately, they don't like seeing ends because they're considered dangerous in first aid so don't forget to do it, do the knot, tuck it in all in one movement and then it's done, okay, how does that feel? That's fine Of course you're reassuring all the time as you do this Mm, mm Got a bit that's fall down Hello we haven't finished yet, haven't finished. Now you're gonna want a pin, these are rather small pins, I recommend that peop people who have got large hands try and fit their first aid kit out with large pins, they're much easier to handle, but firstly they do not put pins in their mouths for obvious reasons, either, either have it on the table open ready or just pop it in the front of shirt while you do this bit, okay? So you're going to fold this around the elbow to give support to the arm and in this one you're gonna fold first of all forward and then back, can you see that little neat envelope? A neat little envelope that's supporting quite firm, that's supporting the elbow, now pin it, again, now you can see how important it is not to have lots and lots of bandage up here, cos what will you do with it then? It's too much, if you ever have too much you can just fold a bit down, if you have a big bandage you can fold either of those edges down first if you've got too much and then you fold it forward and back, now your pin sticks in, but all the material and out of all the material and it goes in a straight upward direction, again it must go in that direction so that if per chance it comes undone it falls out and drops on the floor, whereas if it was sideways or downwards it would open and stick in your casualty, so that's why we have it done that way. Would you like to see that again or do you think you could manage it now? See it again See it again, right, I'll just do it this time without talking it through, and you can just watch Yeah and I tell you what we shall do we shall change arms We'll change arms as well you'll need to practise on both arms. And there's no use getting in the exam on Thursday and say ah well I'm afraid I've not done it on that arm so erm lost Okay, so there you are you see, you're, you're a first aider and you come up to the person and you hold it the way you did last time and you think ah, now that's the wrong way round of course, there's my elbow point, there's my injured elbow, so I have to be that way round, mm, so you turn it round the other way, right, your elbow shape goes to the injured elbow and your long line goes straight up and down the line of the body, you arrange it so that you only just covering the forearm there, with just enough above the hand to tie your reef knot that would be too little and that would be too much just enough above the hands to tie your reef knot, the first thing you do is to tuck nice, big bit of material right under the hand and anchor it into position, just keep that resting there and all the rest of this goes under the arm up between the shoulder blades there and you tie your first half of the reef knot just above the fingers in the hollow of the neck here, now that's important because round the back here if you press on that bit of muscle there, there's a big band of muscle, if you've got a knot on that it gives a great deal of discomfort very quickly so you want to get the knots round in the hollow here that doesn't hurt your casualty, there, draw it up half the knot, is that tight enough? It feels fine Yeah that feels fine and then do your other half of knot, reef knot and tuck it in straight away, you get your pin ready, have it on, either on the table or ready like that, now if you've got too much material ever you just fold that down, there, if that's too much, which isn't too much with Denise because it's the right size sling, sometimes you have to improvise and then you fold if forward and back, firmly, take the pin and put it, put your two fingers down between the casualty so that your fingers are apart and there's a space between your fingers so you can stick the pin in and out again without any danger, if you put the fingers apart like that, if you do stick the pin in yourself and draw blood would you please throw the pin away, as a matter of automatic hygiene, it mustn't be used again once it's been stuck into somebody Or in your casualty or in your casualty, it must be thrown away Do it up, discard it Alright get another one from the box would you please make sure that all through these practices that you deal with different people all the time cos in the exam and for real afterwards you'll have to bandage all different shape people and if you just get, work in pairs you don't get that sort of practice, by all means start of with somebody next door to you but each time you do one go across the room and find somebody you haven't done before. And if the gentleman having to put bandages on a lady and you want to put your hand underneath there just excuse me a moment, alright, because in the exam one row of you will certainly going to have a lady bandage okay, put slings on and to bandage so it's just as well not to get to you know used to bandaging up great big chaps and then you'll find you've got some little tiny five foot two or five foot nothing lady bandaging in exam, alright, so swap around, so get yourselves so you've got a partner and use your bandages and let's just see you do the high sling to start. All got safety pins by the way? Yeah they had them in the little packs, okay? Right How many people know how to do a reef knot for sure? No Right, so I'm not wasting my time a reef knot then? If, if you look in your books page one seven seven, you'll see a beautifully illustrated instruction on how to do it, which you can refer to yourself this evening or later on in the course if you forget but I'm now gonna show you how to do one as well, you, if you want to know it's there for you to look up you take the bandage and fold it into your narrow fold band and put it round your leg, you've got something to tie a reef knot round, okay?if you know how to do a reef knot already fine, just do it, if you don't, follow instructions. Narrow fold bandage you've done it correctly then. The doing it the same way each time and a reef knot is the opposite way each time, alright, undo it, once again, just once again to make sure you know are you ready? Once again, now it doesn't matter which way round you start, you can start left over right or right over left, but the second time you do it opposite to the first time, so the first time I put the left one over first and the right one over that and then tuck it through, just like tying a shoe lace really, okay? And the next, pick the ends up, I put the right one down first and the left one across it and then put that one through and then that's a reef knot no that's a granny over there anyone not sure? That, that's the one you have to remember which one you put on which, that was the left on top of the right, now the right on top of the left yes, come on which one did you do first? That's the right on top of the left okay, right on top of the left, now you've crossed over again left on top of the right, put that through there okay yeah All okay I think mm, yes all okay now, right. I bang my head, I cut my scalp, yeah, everybody, I bang my head, I cut my scalp, not massive bleeding none of the bandages we're doing this morning are to do with massive bleeding, they're all to do with what we call minor wounds, right so small cut, but it needs attention, okay, so I cut my scalp Cor okay so I've got my pad it's a bit tender alright, so I'm going to ask my casualty to hold my nice clean sterile pad that I've got folded ready over the wound, there, gently, okay? Yep Then I'm going to take another triangular bandage and I'm going to open it up and make just a little fold, this is going to go on her forehead and that little fold just helps with keeping it firm and stopping the bandage slip, now, just put it around the forehead like that, okay? Cross it over, round the back, and back up to the front again, do a reef knot here and tuck your ends in straight away of course like so and then this little bit can just be tucked up where you've crossed the two ends and make it look neater with no ends hanging out, no that, all that does is keep the dressing secure, keep infection out, okay? The difficult part about this one is that people all have odd shaped heads, now and you find that if you put them on too high they squidge off like that, and you've got to think of bandaging an egg basically, if you had an egg with a little hole in one end and you've got to put a bandage round you'd have to put it very carefully round the widest bit wouldn't you for it to stay firm and that's the secret, everyone's heads different and as you put it round you've got to see where you can get it, where, sometimes it's over the ears, sometimes it's above the ears according to the peoples' shaped, different shaped heads everyone's different, anything else? Okay, have a go at it and we'll come round and correct what you're doing as you're doing it, alright, so you want to pad over the wound to keep infection out and then try to get your bandage on top of that to keep the dressing in place. Right, well we want to make sure that you can get out to lunch sort of by, that's running a bit fast that clock, we'd like to get you out to lunch by about half past twelve otherwise you'll end up being late don't you with all the other people right Right, okay, what now, erm roller bandages so you can put those triangular ones away for a minute can't you Let's do the elbow and we'll do the elbow and knee okay elbow and knee then using the roller bandage And again here it is two pages further on in your book, if you forget how to do it, just look up, okay? Roller bandages Well I fell over, slipped over in the car park out there, all gravelly and gritty out there and I scraped my elbow and I've got a nasty graze all on the elbow and it's all full of grit and muck, help Come and sit down here my dear help let's give us a little now if we've got a tap handy probably the best thing would be to run it under the cold tap and that hopefully would take away any dirt and extra bits and pieces that are stuck around it. If there's anything embedded in it like gravel or something and it doesn't come away easily you mustn't, it comes under the categories of what you call foreign bodies, which first aider is not at liberty to poke about, you must leave foreign bodies that don't come away easily where they are and bandage them round and send them off to hospital or a doctor, but assuming it's just a little clean graze, if I haven't got a tap to put it under, then I must use little bits of gauze to wash, put in a bowl of water and just wipe, yeah, and you always wipe obviously from the centre of a wound towards the outside, otherwise if you start to wipe across the whole thing you take dirt from one side of the wound across and drop it off in the middle somewhere, so you wipe from the centre out and throw that piece away and you take another piece and wipe from the centre out and so on until you feel happy, quite happy. I mean, well if you haven't got gauze in your first aid box, but you could have something like a Mediwipe or you might be able to use, open up your bandage and you can use, you know, several pieces of this, just keep going down the bandage and then you know clean it and get rid of that bit, okay, another clean bit okay, so you can adapt with whatever you've got in your first aid box, yes, and you won't necessarily have scissors to hand so you'll have to do whatever you've got and the little Mediwipes are very useful for that, but don't use one Mediwipe for seventy five grazes, okay, one Mediwipe for one wipe and then discard, okay? Okay, so I'm going to open up my sterile dressing now So I actually put my arm out straight for you now? Do you think it'd be better if you had it bent cos it'll be easier for you after I've bandaged it It's better bent is it? Yes Okay, alright it would be better if you can manage alright to bend if it's not too uncomfortable so I can bend it, I can bend it like that then? Right, you can only bend, you can only put the arm in the position that your casualty will let you of course, but it is more comfortable to have it bandaged in that position, than having it like that. So you open it up and you find which is your sterile bit and you put that over the point of the elbow and you can bring that once around and you can ask her to hold it for you, if you like It goes in there right yes and then you take your long end and you wind above covering the edge and overlapping and then the low, then covering the edge and overlapping, there and again you keep working your way up and down, a figure of eight until you get to the end of your bandage then tie away from the body in your reef knot, either you tuck your ends in or if that's awkward you can just put a sticking plaster over the ends to get them out of the way like that, so just tuck the ends in and I don't think your casualty's going to need a sling for a little graze like that Right, and so that she can still move and as the same thing applies to the knee exactly the same thing, wound there you keep the knee bent a little bit and you can do exactly the same bandage like a figure of eight, okay? So one person will do the bandage on the elbow and the other person with the good looking knees, you'll be the casualty for where you've got to put the knee bandage on, cos you won't, if you don't roll your trousers up a bit you're not going to have much bandage to do much bandaging with on the knee, okay, so decide amongst yourselves who's got the good looking knee Everybody okay now? Yeah Yeah? Excuse me I've got a circulation problem Now All okay then? Yeah? A couple more to show you then you can practise these when you have a bit more practice time so we can get you out to lunch on time. If you have to bandage a hand for example, okay? Somebody's slipped over and they've got all the grit in their knuckles in the part of their knuckles and you want to bandage the hand or there's a cut on the hand, even on the palm, we can do that one later when it's really, when it's really a gash, gushing blood we can do this afternoon, I repeat again none of these which you've done this morning will control severe bleeding, get it into your heads this is just to cover to keep infection out, alright, these are not to control severe bleeding just covering a minor wound or a graze, right? So she's got her knuckles grazed, you've cleansed it, put it into a drop of water,ra or else we've used the Mediwipes or the end of the bandage okay, now we just cover it, okay, so it goes over, can you just straighten out your hand for me, it goes over the wound, okay and you can take this one that she can hold it for you just up there, right, now the rest of this just winds round, the only thing you really need to do is to just make sure that you leave the thumb out, cover up the bottom right and then come up towards the wrist, cover up the top of the pad, come back down again, leave the thumb out all the time, got the idea? Right, cover up again, come up towards the wrist, if you've got any more bandage, go round perhaps one more time okay and just make sure at the end of the day that you don't tie too tightly round the wrist, why not? Stop circulation Absolutely, so really we want to tie away from this pulse point here towards the back of the hand, good enough Yeah right, tie it off in a reef knot, if you've got bits that are left dangling they're too long and you can't go round again because it's gonna make it too tight, you can either tuck them in or else you can fold them down, a nice clean plaster and put it right over the top, okay? Now that would do, that would do whether the, whether the knuckles were hurt or it was just a minor cut in the palm of the hand there, that would do and you can use the same type of bandage on the foot alright, so that's if the hand was damaged, now supposing we didn't have the hand damaged, but we had instead a cut up here, okay, again clean it and if you clean it with lots of water always remember to dry off around the wound because bugs love a moist skin to grow in, dry the wound before you apply the dressing okay if you can, dry it off the best you can and then you're going to place that over the cut, remember you want the pad to be long enough, big enough, okay, now she can hold this for you again, she can hold it above where the wound is and now when you bandage this one you always bandage from the narrow part to the fat part of the limb, you always bandage from the narrow to the fat, so you take the bandage down Why? Because that way it stays on if you do it the other way it'll drop off it's as simple as that, okay, cover the pad and as you spiral up the arm all you need to do is to cover about two thirds of what you've just done before, just like a spiral, you find the bandages, the more you use those roller bandages of yours the worse they get to control because they lose their, you know, nice and stretchiness, so you just do, cover up the pad at the top, tie always on the top of the arm never underneath here. Check with your casualty that it's comfortable, yes? and does it feel quite firm for you? Not too tight though? No And those bits again, either tuck them in out of the way or better still fold them over and put a big plaster over the top to get them right out the way so no ends are left dangling, remember for most people you're doing this for they'll probably be returning to their place of work, okay, so they need to be safe to return to work, everybody okay on that lot? So let's just recap on the ones you've done this morning, you've done a high sling yes Mm you've used a triangular bandage to cover a wound in the scalp, it's not a chopping block wound right, it's not the chopper in its wound right, it's just a minor wound in the scalp, yes, and that came round and tied at the front, tucked at the back, you used these roller bandages to cover a graze or a wound on the end of an elbow or a knee or the hand, foot and then a straight one up the arm okay, so a lot of your bandaging is using these little roller bandages with the lint pad and don't forget when you get into the exam do it, don't do it the wrong way round, remember that you look at your bandage and you put the lint onto the wound, not the other way round right, yeah, you put the lint face down onto the wound, okay? Any questions of anything we've done? All alright on that, yes? We get time to practise these again before the exam? Oh yes , now if by any chanc chance you do have a question in the exam where you're asked you know instead of the wound being on top of the scalp, some clever so and so decides that you're good at improvising and you've got a wound over the top of the eyebrow, the eyebrow's split, okay, so there wouldn't be much good of me going a minute, pull that there, trying like this round there right, okay, it's not really in the best interest of the casualty is it, right, now what dressing would you apply to that do you think? A plaster Plaster An eye plaster, an eye pad A an eye pad won't really sop up blood will it? A roller plaster One of them, of course you will, you use a roller bandage won't you again? In this instance you can put it across the eyebrow, right, across the eyebrow, ask them to hold it and if you're doing a bandage like this the way to keep it on is to have one part of the bandage going above the ear and the next time you go round go below the ear right, go above the ear and the next time you go round go below the ear okay and then finally just tie it off, get the idea? Okay, so they may ask you to use something which you haven't necessarily had to do before so that they're really all that the examiner's testing is that you've got a little bit of nous, a little bit of savvy and with what you've got available you can improvise a dressing or use the dressing in a sensible manner so that your casualty's comfortable and you're doing the best you can for them, okay? Lovely. Anything else to add Audrey? No that's fine Everyone alright then, okay, it's time for grub isn't it? Yes it is, quarter past one please Quarter past one back here, okay? Anyone want coffee? Anyone staying here and want a cup of coffee? Yes please Yeah we'll do one in a minute for you then So you have the heart of the centre of it, two pumps back to back yes, the major pump or the stronger pump on the left hand side, why? That's where the blood leads by, okay, on that side of the heart the left hand side of the heart it's being pumped and therefore the muscle is a bigger muscle, that's doing the contracting, the blood push out and it relaxes back again and that allows the blood to be sucked back down into the heart, okay, and the next time it's shh, that goes out and then it relaxes down again and the blood sucks back down into the heart, okay so that's what it does, all the muscle can do is that, muscle can only retract and then it relaxes, contract and then it relaxes, that's what the heart's doing all the time, how many beats a minute? Sixty to eighty Sixty to eighty you can feel it at pulse point, can't you, here, here, we'll show you so more in a minute, okay? So you know how to check whether the circulatory system is working because if it's working you'll be able to find a pulse pounding away, yes, that's how you check it, you know the respiratory system's working because if you want to check it what do you want to look for? Rise and fall Rise and fall of chest breath on your hand or your cheek, circulatory system working, pulse, okay? And that's what you're checking, the other side of the heart, the right hand side of the heart with a smaller pump, where's that pumping? Blood out The lungs Back up to the lungs, okay, now in that little system there, there's just one thing that's interesting to note, when you spoke about circulatory system this morning or yesterday rather with Audrey, you spoke about the blood being always leaving the heart, yes, via the arteries, yes Yes and always coming back to the heart By the veins by the veins , there's always an exception to every rule and the exception to that rule in the case of the heart and the lung connection is the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein, you may not get asked anything about this, but just in case you do it's as well to know, in that instance the flow is reversed, in other words the pulmonary vein takes blood away from the heart and up to the lungs, and the pulmonary artery brings the oxygenated blood back down to the heart from the lungs, if you want to have a look at the diagrams for that and look at it yourself later on, there's no need for you to get concerned or confused about this at all, there's no need. You'll find the little diagram showing you where the pulmonary vein and the pulmonary artery are on page eleven, page eleven if you want to refer to it right, if you want to look at it in a closer detail tonight that's fine and if you want to see what I'm saying now in a diagrammatic form look on page thirteen now if you look at that you'll see some, the blue vein blood vessels it's coming out of the right hand side of the heart and if you look at the direction of the arrows, okay, they're going away from the heart, do you agree with me? They come out of the heart and branch like a wishbone, one to each lung, do you see that, now the arrow direction is away from the heart and that's a vein and you'd expect that to be coming back to the heart wouldn't you? And that's the only time you're going to find it when you're linking the heart and the lungs, now look at those two areas where you've got blood coming back down into the heart, can you see those two wishbones there coming back down into the heart, do you see where I mean, yes? Now those are arteries, that's the pulmonary artery but it's coming back to the heart okay, that's the only time you're going to find the rule reversed, arteries leave the heart, veins come back to the heart, and the only time that rule is reversed is when you're linking the heart and the lungs through the pulmonary vein and the pulmonary artery, however, they are still carrying, the arteries are still carrying oxygen charged blood, yes, because it's come fresh from the lungs so it's still carrying nice red lovely oxygenated blood, yes, even though it's coming back into the heart, that is because it's come fresh from the lungs and the vein although it's going in the opposite direction the way you normally expect it, is still carrying the old rotten, you know, used up blood, because it's going back to the lungs to be recharged, do you understand it alright? That's the only time it'll be reversed Can you just say that bit about the pulmonary in the vein and the pulmonary in the wee artery again please The pulmonary artery comes back into the heart, the pulmonary vein goes away from the heart Vein goes home back up to the lungs, they are linking the heart and the lungs Yeah, I've written that down alright and if you look at the diagram on page thirteen and you look at the little arrow diagram you'll see that it gives it quite nice and clearly there is that alright? Just wanted to clarify that little point, so you know the organs that make up the circulatory system, you know how to check it, you know the one slight difference than what you normally expect veins and arteries to be doing okay? Now we need to talk a little bit about what happens when the veins or the arteries or the capillaries for that matter, the veins, the arteries or the capillaries have a leak in them, they become broken, now you already know that the circulatory system is a closed system and that the blood can only do its job if it's being transported within that system, once the blood comes outside of that system then it's lost the circulation and it cannot perform its proper function any more, in other words the body's losing its blood, okay, what condition do we call it when the circulatory system stops working properly? Shock Shock, do you understand the difference between the loss of pressure and loss of volume, volume would be when liquid was leaking out, coming out of the blood vessels, okay, pressure would be when the heart itself, the pump itself had failed or was not working properly, failed completely or was not working properly, do you understand the difference? Obviously eventually if people keep on leaking blood their pressure will fall but you could have a situation where there's not a single drop of blood yet lost to the system and yet the person's in shock because the blood's not being circulated properly off the heart, not a drop of blood lost to the system, but insufficient pressure, so shock can be caused by either of those two things, failure of the circulatory system because the pressure of the volume drops dangerously low, okay, you did a lot of work on what the person looks like, yes you as the casu you as the first aider will see this person in front of you, what will they be like? What will their face look like? .And perhaps the the neighbours leave the dog with Mandy how ever it is. The dog stays in the house on his own. Every day they go to work! Mm? Christine goes to work! The dog stays on his own! Well, Christine takes him up there if they come here for the weekend. Oh yeah. Or he, he goes and opens the door to let him out. Well there you, you see!

No. No. Yeah er Prime Minister, John Major John Major's anxious wife, Norma has a job keeping her cool as she faces the anger of a town blighted by unemployment. The couple were both shoved and jostled as around one hundred demonstrators greeted them with jeers and shouts in Bolton, Lancashire. Police helmets went flying as officers formed a protective cordon around the Majors. Bricklayer, Tony one of the town's twelve thousand jobless said I came along to show my contempt with his government policies! Mr Major abandoned the plan of twenty minutes full campaign walk about after just five minutes ! Mm. We don't want them, you see! No. It looks better all the time don't it? Well i , if, it would be like that all over the country! But in one place ! Well it is like that all over the country though innit? No. Well I think the sky is brightening up! I do hope so! I mean, you can see that red bush in the corner quite clear now! Can you? Mm. And I would see it a lot clearer if my glasses were clean! Well I saw something here! I don't know what it was, but only a little tiny wee bit and it was real funny! I think . I can't find it now! It's always the way! No! Well I got some of . I can't remember where it is. Mm mm mm mmmm mm mm mm Oh ho, off to work we go da da da dum dum da da . What about ? James and Stuart a couple of and when he was preg erm that's Douglas Hurd. Oh yeah Dougie! He, when he was Foreign Secretary. What is he now? Foreign Secretary, you know? Mhm. He's so public, him. Oh God! Who would imagine! Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd is on the telly all the time telling us he can't put his eye on a labour government to be firm with Gadaffi of Libya or sa or Saddam Hussein of Iraq. So here I publish a picture of him ten years ago when he was Junior Minister he is enjoying a marvellous a party at London's Intercontinental Hotel. He's forced the Libyan government a cause for celebration the tenth anniversary of the coming to power of their president Colonel Gadaffi. Mhm. Previous year Mr Hurd on behalf of the Foreign office was celebrating in the . The great event, an anniversary of the coming of power of the the dictatorship. And who was top man in that dictat in that dictatorship to which Iron Man Hurd raised his glass! Saddam Hussein ! Mm. didn't it? Mm. Mhm, and now they're trying to fight to get him from there! Well now they are fighting! I mean the , they've done it once a , and didn't do it! That's all creating him back up now isn't it? He was given a, a week Ah, ah, ah, ah ! or a fortnight or something to do something with their lot. It isn't raining is it? No, I don't think. A bit foggy! Dunno. Well, let's hope this weather picks up for when Margaret gets here. Or she'll be looking a bear skin! And her super warm coat! Oh yes ! Well i ah, I dunno. Well she won't think it's cold because I mean, it's sunny every day is it? Well she couldn't of had it colder than when dad was in hospital! And by hell it was cold! Bitter cold! And wet! And blowing! You couldn't had it worst! The only you could of had was the snow! Ooh, but that was! Well she shivered! And she shivered! Yeah ! Yeah, and what, new clothing and she said as, well what she used to say about it was nobody's business! And I mean, if they get a we , a wet day isn't it just rainy in there, it's lovely and warm! In there, well , but it isn't warm . But it is to us who is used to this sodding weather! We had lovely weather then! And, and we only had a rain on one day I think it was. Er, you know, like a shower, one big shower. Well normal shower. And it must have been cold bloody flat! Mm. Must of been, cos they'd been out all day. No fire, no nothing on! And then to go home, tired and cold in an empty place, and cold and must of been terrible! Oh I dunno if yo you get into bed and the blanket was on,yo you know, you know? She said she wasn't expecting to go out, out all day ! Well she erm she can't remember exactly! But I mean er she knew But Rowan and her went on Boxing Day. When did David and Pam go? I've no idea. Cos she didn't sleep here. So they all must have gone out for the dinner. So they must of stayed until erm Boxing Day, Christmas Day rather. Oh they're coming here for Christmas. Wish they was. .And they went on Boxing Day dinner. They had their dinner and went! I've no idea! Not the foggiest! Didn't they stay at the flat? Somebody did! Yeah, David and Pam and Margaret all slept at the flat! And they must of come over for Christmas dinner. Yes, because David tucked into his er Christmas pudding! He loved it! And Pam was shouting about the bloody cholesterol! And then they had Boxing Day dinner. And David and Pam must have gone as well, cos Margaret went with Rowan. Up Newtown way, they were going up to Ruth. And Wonder where she got ? I shall bloody quiz her about that! And er David and Pam must of gone the other way you know, they'd gone their way home, and had gone her way home. But er and then Astra was here and she was going bloody North! She goes ey and it's colder up there ! Well she found it cold here and she . Oh it was hysterical because it was blowing a gale! Violet and me were over cleaning your flat. That was the day you was taken into hospital and she was in the bed, cos they were on their way down so we were changing the bloody beds! And you come down through the alley way and you could not keep your feet on the floor! You could move! And we'd got these bags,, I said just bang all the sheets into bin bags, we can wash them next week if you think I'm starting! But make sure, you know, you well you take over the house, so we know what's in them in case they get thrown out with the bloody rubbish! So we put them all into bin bags and we was trying to carry these bin bags so the wind was taking them like balloons ! And you were hanging on and trying to keep your feet on the floor! God, I laughed! And then er they came. I can't remember what time or anything about it. I think they must have come to the flat. They'd been for a meal and they came to the flat and they rung us to say they were there. Something like that, I can't remember. And then, the next day they came over. I think they came that night. The next day they came over. And this gale was still blowing! And it was blowing! You just couldn't Well I dare say they went back to the hospital! No, they didn't! No they didn't get, be there till eight! Just eight-ish something like that. Cos they'd been for a meal on the way as well! Cos I've said come over for supper. No, they didn't want supper. Cos they'd had this meal. And erm then the next day they came over and David was laughing, he said, do you, do you know the alley way down between he said, well it blew it her up right against that bloody wall he said! Well Aunty couldn't move he said! He I and I said, and you laughed at her? Course I did he said ! And I said, did you help her? No, I didn't. Let her battle it out he said! Well they came over here then and they'd been up and they come back with Gillian and all that and they stayed. And they went from here about nine-ish I suppose? They'd had supper anyway. Then they were going over and they were gonna go to bed. They'd been to the hospital, and they'd been over the flat so I said to them well pop the blankets on and come over here then and have your supper and go back. And the beds will be nice and warm for you to get into. But anyway, they left here about nine o'clock. Well she'd gone out through the door and the wind took her down the bloody street! I said to though, he said she was going there another way! And David was there was laughing ! And it was just she was running with it! There's just her battling against it ! They have mid-winter days just like our high summer! It was lovely! Oh and we laughed about it! And I said, better go and collect her! But David said look at shifting ! Yeah but er you see on Christmas Day children were going about in bikinis and and shorts , or no socks or so Mm. I couldn't, you know,i ,i , it's difficult to put it in your head, like when I was there! Oh, it's Christmas Day you know? Mm. Christmas Day! And I get us up in the morning now and, she said she said the temperature rises to sometimes a hundred and twenty in the summer! And if promotion is concerned, yes I will not deny every tenant probably knows about the right to buy but then everybody knows there are mars bars and mars bars spend millions of pounds promoting their product. You have to y y y you have to promote the product to make people buy it. I'm following on from that. Of course people must be advised carefully but it shows great lack of faith in human na in their abilities and a great arrogance on our part Mr Mayor if we fail to market the ideas simply because we don't feel the populus are competent to understand it. If we fail to take this opportunity Mr Mayor, as I as I feel we are about to do I am a hundred percent convinced that in years to come people will look back at this year, or however long it happens to be and say they missed out on a golden opportunity to make social, to make more houses and to make social housing better in this city and across the country. I very much hope that you will in fact support the motion as originally intended. Could I just point out that councillor that contrary to call my bluff, deviation and repetition are no grounds for allowing allowing . All those in favour of the proposals please show and all those against. I now turn to the adoption minutes of city hall and now it is a process of in that city hall did not endorse a recommendation from the finance panel, the budget that came from finance panel erm so we are in the slightly unusual position of having to debate the proposals of finance panel as we were recommended to do by city hall, erm that means as I understand it that er the chair of city hall will now present the annual budget statement erm and since he is going to do that in a form of an amendment er that seven other unusual features about the way in which we would normally do it which would mean that there would be er a budget statement and where there would then be the the formal proposals and amendments themself, erm so what I would propose is to try and make sure that everybody has, has maximum opportunity to have their say erm because no two amendments can be on the floor at one time er to take what the leader of the council said first of all erm then to allow the other two leaders to present their budget alternatives as it were, without it be, this is just not didn't take it at that point if they don't want to. But to present the full scenario and then vote er on the the different items er so that voting is done on items on the amendment before we then proceed er if you want to we just have to go to amendments to that because of course no two amendments can be on the floor at the same time. Er, what I would prefer to do is to er listen to the amendment put forward by the as if that were an amendment to the adoption minute since there's nothing to be adopted at the moment, erm I will then speak on that amendment, well I would probably speak against it erm at that point er there could be a vote on that amendment line by line. When that vote is finished er there there's then the opportunity for further amendment. Absolutely. A a a and that i i if that's sort of what you're saying. That that that's exactly what I was, I was . Mr Mayor on on a point of order Mr Mayor er standing order sixty two refers explicitly to community charge or the poll tax, I think that before we move into this debate we should amend that so that it does refer to the council tax which is what we will be debating. to my left has anything to say on the subject. My only slight reservation is whether it's possible to have,t t to move an amendment to standing order . Can, can we take that as being unanimous? Yes. Good, good. Thank you very much. Leader of the councils. We have known for a number of years that we with every other council in the land, are facing the government that does not believe in local government. That believes that local councils should operate services, should do it at the dictate of the department of the environment and indeed it's regrettable that we are surrounded by some local authorities who feel that their world is precisely that. Far be it for me to mention Huntingdon district council but that is one which immediately leaps to mind. The fact that their citizens leak into the city to avail themselves of our facilities is something that we might deal with in another sphere, even on day residents were seen to attend the theatre in this town recently, erm unfortunately this authority doesn't see fit to actually subsidise the theatre. However,it is that means that over the last few years every time we have actually debated about budget we recognised that the force had unwillingly and against the judgement of the majority of this council, not necessarily er bounded by political affiliation, we have to be getting down further and further towards the completely inaccurate expanded spending assessment that is assessed as necessary for the needs of this city by the department of the environment. Now clearly this is a process that is going to continue this year. We had originally intended to freeze our budget at precisely the level that it has been at the last two years for a variety of reasons we have decided that it is sensible to actually bring it down yet further. There are two reasons for this. Firstly the process of moving down towards our S S A needs to be facilitated because my own instinct is that the government, faced with all sorts of financial tribulations, is going to take a harder and harder nosed attitude towards local government expenditure, as it will unfortunately with an awful lot of the rest of what we have come to expect over the decades to be the responsibility of central government, clearly the current expenditure review is going to have some nasty shocks in it for consumers of account services, consumers of other assets of the welfare state but particularly I would suspect, the local government. Additionally however, we need to make it clear that when we have looked at the figures and I would pay some to the opposition for bringing er some matters to our attention, erm and looking at the way in which very, very careful on the part of this council has led to a better reserve position than we would previously have expected. There is a sense of which that good housekeeping with the inevitable consequences of government policy can be, can be in terms if you like, or benefits to the council tax payers, who have after all in a under the complete disaster of the poll tax which nobody but nobody in this chamber I suspect knew more unless there is at least one partisan tory who will try to save it, it was really a wonderful experiment and it's a shame it didn't continue. On that basis we have an amendment to the budget as presented to the finance panel and as the Mayor explained . If I can talk immediately to scope of that amendment before moving on to some points about the budget . With regard to the first lies my group has come to the conclusion that there is a way in which the employment development budget can be augmented to specifically reserve at least the part of the current posish provision provided by the cooperative development erm we stand by our opinion that there are ways in which that service can be more efficiently administered that this is a sensible way forward. With regard to the contingency contingency is something which has often been a matter of debate within this council. It has been a matter of debate because there are those in the council who feel that if you put in a contingency provision it will be spent whether it's needed or not. There are many of us who feel that it is sheer wilfulness if one assumes that there will be no contingency in the course of the year that needs to be budget . This year might represent a compromise with regard to the those two opposition positions which again I would suggest are something that perhaps owes more to than it does to actual political affiliation. The regard to the job evaluation budget suggests that our original figure of a hundred thousand pounds is not fully necessary and that can all be reduced to fifty percent, to fifty percent or the equivalent say to fifty thousand pounds and the same goes for the judgement with regard to how you are going to have figure with regard to jobs vacancies. That will bring the eventual budget down a fine tune particularly with regard to er recommendations of the housing committee with regard er to the erm which clearly there will be some people. What we have done is to suggest that we actually need a lower budget than we had originally assessed. This is in line with the obvious policy, not just of the ruling group, but I suspect of the council as a whole that we know that sooner or later courtesy of this government, whether we like it or not we are going to have to get down to our standard spending assessment. The policy of this council over the last couple of years has been to get down to that figure enforced upon us as gracefully as possible with the least damage to our services and the least damage to the morale of our staff and our staff are after all the most important asset that a local authority possesses and that is what we're trying to consider. Everybody will be aware of the fact that in the course of the last two budgetary years we have made savings in excess of what we had anticipated. Those savings have been achieved by very careful housekeeping indeed. By a rigid look at vacancies, by the constant search after efficiency, efficiency savings. By looking hard at any way in which we can raise extra income for this authority. A classic example of good housekeeping which has made Cambridge a authority in the region and beyond and one that even members of the conservative government have occasionally, through gritted teeth they're not doing a bad job, damn them and that means that the are going to think to have some of those, if you like, very good housekeeping back to the citizens who have been paying the bills over the years. For instance to this is an assumption that although we are going to have a shortfall on the collection fund, again because of good housekeeping we believe that this action is what people want by the charge payers of the city and again that in this financial year it can be taken out of the . This seems to me to be a highly , high responsible budget bringing us closer and closer to a position where we will eventually reach. We are spending now, if this budget is accepted, a mere eleven percent of the standard spending assessment levels which means that in time we are going to get down to where the government is going to demand that we . We may not want it but the government is going to demand it and we as custodians of the services on the part of the people of Cambridge, are going to have to do as sensibly and sensitively as possible. There are some more points I've got to make about the budget in general. The first thing is that I think people need to recognise that the investigation of savings generated a figure of one point four million pounds. That is an extraordinary amount of money to find in terms of savings. It's not a figure that represents gross inefficiencies, gross over expenditure. What it represents I would suggest, is the desperate attempt to trim off the margin to find every single last way in which we can follow the government diktat whilst preserving our full services. But I do think that we need to recognise this on council that there is a cost associated with that one point four million pounds worth of savings and those costs come in two different directions. One cost is that clearly some services are being cut in terms of how good they are. We need to recognise that some letters will take longer to answer that public loos will not be as fully attended as they have been in the past. That some community events will not take place. That some voluntary organisations will not get the grants that they previously expected. All of these trims at the margins which I would suggest, detract from the quality of life of people in this city, something that we regret, but something which can and has been enforced upon us. We're trying to the horrors of central government diktat are all closing upon this city. But there is a cost of that and it's a cost that people will recognise. They will recognise it too in terms of higher charges than perhaps ideally we would want to impose for certain services which the city operates, whether it be sports pitches or whether to be brutal, it's the cost of actually burying the dead. Perhaps those are things that in the best of all possible worlds we wouldn't want to but we are forced so to do. But there's another cost to the savings that have been exemplified and that we are going to be forced to take with regard to this budget and that is something that anybody who uses the city council services, and particularly I would suggest councillors, are going to notice and that is the stress that we are putting on the people that we employ. It is all very well to say to any people organisation you shall become more and more efficient. In the end there has to be a limit, there has to be a level beyond which you cannot go without people cracking under the strain, without people saying I'm now doing the job that was done by two people, two and half people a few years ago. It doesn't mean that you don't look for efficiencies but it does mean that we need to recognise that we are putting a burden on our staff which I think we will be callous and stupid to disregard. I that in terms of many of the so called efficiency measures that we could take, we are reaching the absolute limits in this authority. There are areas, one or two of which I will go on to elude to, which I still think are actually going to make for the greatest savings in the coming financial year and thereafter. But in terms of saying there are easy savings to be found in terms of greater efficiencies in this authority I warn you, we are reaching the level unless we actually want in putting a completely unacceptable level of stress on the people who we employ and who universally serve this city very finely and give such a very high level of service. I know that there are views among the opposition groups about what should be cut out of this budget. We have decided that the fundamental points as far as the is concerned is the presentation of services. Wherever we have looked for savings, we have looked to trimming away at the centre and preserving those services that are delivered to the citizens in a direct way. Some of them and we make no bones about this, are delivered undoubtedly to minorities, they're delivered to small groups of people in the city, to people who are in any care in the community need to be given special consideration. If we house them we need to look after all the people, we make no apologies for the fact that this is a budget slanted towards equal opportunities and to an anti-poverty strategy and that is something that we will fight to preserve and we would expect support from at least some quarters in order to achieve an egalitarian status in this city. The same is true of some of the bids, we've allowed more bids this year than perhaps it was the case in the past. The bids that we have wording of support. We want to do something for the voluntary sector. Fifty thousand pounds extra for the voluntary sector at a time when a recession, when so called but completely un care in the community is putting a tremendous burden of responsibility both on the voluntary sector and on we know what a good job the voluntary sector do in this city thousand pounds is a small proportion of the money that they are actually requesting from us. It's in a place in the direction of the work that they do, it is not enough, we would like to provide more. But ill betide anyone who says, says that that is money that's not going to be . Pollution, the environment, again that is something which is not just for concern, we know it's of global concern as well. We have some responsibilities in that direction. Yes we have to operate within our resources, but if we're looking to er how recycling that seems to us a bid which is worthy of backing regardless of political affiliation. If you listen to any national politician they pay to the importance of environmental concerns and to actually say that that's a bid that can't be approved. Putting more money into the taxi part scheme, a scheme that is anything but everybody in the surrounding authorities, how many of us have had letters from the residents of Gerton or Promberton or wherever else complaining that they want to be included in this scheme. Something that provides a life line, mobility for people who otherwise would find that they were being seriously disadvantaged, that their lives would not be as full as . Each and every one of the bids however they refer to particular minority groups, whether they refer to the group are I think, justifiable. They're justifiable because we're doing within very tight financial constraints. This is a very responsible budget indeed. It brings down our level of expenditure. It leaves no fortune with regard to what the department of the environment might throw at us next year unless they completely lose their marbles, which after all is always possible. Which I suspect the odd tory MP having a heart attack, falling under a bus, the loss of directions might actually mean that they might see a degree of sense in borough capping . It leaves few hostages to fortune with regard to the department of the environment. We after all, bring our expenditure down, we're down near two million pounds under new cap capping rules. That is not under any circumstances responsible judging. It is also the budget that has taken notice of what the opposition have actually said we listened to you we have not persevered with our original thinking, we've talked to the officers, we've listened to what you've said, we may not have done it with the greatest grace possible but . Comes very much as difficult to grace but erm and we have brought our expectations down. But the budget in general is one that we withstand. We think that it conserves services, that it has searched out the vast majority of efficiencies that we can find within this council and that it doesn't pass on to the poll tax, council tax payers the fruits, I mean it does pass on the poll tax or council tax payers the fruits of how we have achieved savings and efficiencies over the last couple of years. We've done well it's time that that was actually passed on . There are further areas which in time year will allow that trend to continue, I'm aware of the fact that there will probably be in the course of the evening that suggest that greater efficiencies can be found in a variety of areas whether it be in or wherever else. We have our own ideas about that. We have gone out with regard to our team through voluntary competitive tender. That is designed to save money for this authority. We are looking seriously at the costs of such in-house items as car leasing. We've continued to keep a very hard view of the corn exchange and a number of other bodies which we fund, but we're going to see what actually happens, we're not going to make blind predictions about savings without actually going into the facts. If we make further savings in the course of the next financial year the benefit will be felt by the citizens of Cambridge and it's no good promising them things which we can't deliver. This is a budget that promises what it will deliver. That bears the fruits of past, sound financial management, preserved services and looks for as many efficiencies as possible. Far be it for me to say that this is the sort of budget that conservatives ought to applaud because it is after all, a budget that is guided by a feeling that councils should provide services and they should orientate their services to the least communities, to be guided by equal opportunities and by egalitarians and that's what this group has always stood for, this is the budget that we present tonight and I would hope that it would get a far better and far larger measure of support than perhaps of course been the case in the past. Is there a second? Yes. Is there anybody else . Thank you Mr Mayor, erm well this may be a budget the conservative might applaud but I'm . Yes,one wonders how get actually. David Owen might be buying membership soon. But seriously I'm against this budget because of what is, what it doesn't contain rather than what it does contain. the policies that it represents, still represents even as amendment. Repeat this evening. That labour's budget doesn't do anything new to meet those challenges. Education cuts. Interesting the party supposedly in favour of education groans when education is mentioned. Interesting to to speculate and I'll do this a little later on, ask them why the labour party's so obsessed with opposing education . There's also pollution the environment,the council mentioned those, there's nothing new in this budget. Nothing new about the lack of public transport in Cambridge. And about the biggest problem today, that of unemployment what we have is nine thousand pounds put back into the the employment development fund. Still leaving . What we have is nine thousand pounds put back into the employment development fund still leaving a cut. This is no time to cut anything from the employment development fund, from the training budget, even sixteen thousand pounds. So the fails to meet all these challenges. Make no apologise ds ds to starting with education, the county council is cutting seven million pounds from education this year. A dozen or more teachers in city schools may lose their jobs, maybe more. More than half the city's schools are faced with real cuts in their budgets. County talks about putting a million pounds back in and it turns out that this million pound in fact is part of a two million pound cut that appears to have been made. It's all a mistake of calculation from when the government nationalised further education. The city could act, the city could do something about it but it won't. The ruling group, the labour party, refuses to do anything about this at all. I don't want to hear any more nonsense about doing the county council's job because the city already does lots of things for the county council concessionary fares for the elderly for example. On the city board last week we had yet another example rather a good project Trumpington disability project, very likely but it's social services budget. And a question you have to ask yourself is why the labour party is prepared to spend on all the aspects of county council responsibility except education. Why is this? Why does the labour party seem to education? The one thing it will not, it will not spend money on. Education is important to everyone, it's not a m a minority group, it's important to individuals for their own self fulfilment, it's important for society for our economic future and our future as a democracy. So why the opposition and after all this time, eighteen months of debate. And from the labour party, reason after reason, feeble reason after reason . After all this time reason and reason's been knocked down, one after the other and what did we get last time? We got votes against our proposals with no reasons given at all, you've now got down to the point of having no reasons at all for opposing what we want to do. So what is why is it that labour party oppose education spend? So I think we're getting rather strange signals out of tonight's budget, on the one hand we have councillor the John Smith clone, although at least put a bit of weight on. On the other hand We seem to have a labour party that treats education as some kind of middle class hobby that thinks of education spending as something spent only on the bourgeoisie, something to do with a university, something not really important for ordinary people. If that's not the reason, what is the reason? And one suspects it might be back in the days of the nineteen fifties, nineteen sixties when the labour party opposed anything at local level,of course, but at local level that might tend towards helping people to be upwardly mobile on the grounds that upwardly mobile people stop voting labour. I don't want to go to the story as to why the labour party opposed the er th the entry to the city of Marks and Spencer but it's an interest . They didn't want working people to have decent clothes . I really do hope the labour party is stuck in some kind of thirties plan I'm afraid I've got my doubts. Will you stop laughing. the circumstances I wonder how well this is to the current debate as opposed to amendments which I suspect will be moved later on. I'll give my reasons for voting against this budget. It's got no education spending. I I I think that councillor should be allowed to continue. because er he's just one person who remembers those years. Ooh. There are other grounds remaining for opposing this budget. It still hasn't tackled all the waste there is in the council, we'll get back to that when we amendment. It still hasn't done anything new, has no new ideas about traffic and environmental problems. And of course it's a budget which is on an attitude towards the Parkside Pool problem which we disagree with therefore in no way do we support it. But there are many reasons, as you will see when we put our amendment asking why are budget proposals are different from the ruling groups but the main reasons are simply the ruling group's refusal, for whatever reason, I just wanna hear the reasons. to do anything about the major problems facing the city. Councillor . Yes I would like also to speak against this amendment erm but for completely different reasons. I don't intend to give the council a to solving the world's problems and that's not the word to mind but problems. . Because I do recognise Mr Mayor er I have to say, that this amendment is a step in the right direction. But I believe that the councillor er is somewhat cynical in the what that he has put this forward. Tories producing rabbits out of hats is the big bad headline, wasn't it. You know we're the ones accused of doing these things at the last moment. We're the ones who you know, don't tell anybody what our strategy is going to be, we suddenly spring it on the members right at the end of the process at the council meeting. We're not running the council the labour group are running the council er but they on this occasion Mr Mayor, are the ones producing the rabbits out of the hats. And I'll congratulate the leader of the council on a wonderful conjuring act with this amendment. I asked at the meeting of the city board and I asked on more than one occasion, and didn't get a proper answer, what the labour group intended to do with the three point two million pounds that will build up in reserve say for the next three years. I made it clear that our policy was to use that money to reduce the level of the council tax over that period of time. I couldn't get any clear commitment er from er you Mr Mayor, or the leader of the council as to what would do with that three point two million pounds. I also pressed at the city board for something to be done about this problem of the er people disappearing off the poll tax register at an alarming rate I must add. And I was absolutely amazed and I think all of us on the opposition benches were absolutely amazed at the city board that you appeared to have no proposals whatsoever to do anything about that situation. I find found that absolutely incredible and I thought it was bizarre to say the least, the procedure we had to go through the other er evening erm with two hours of acrimonious debate er a break while you consulted er the officers before we got to some er sensible way forward which is now incorporated in this amendment er to spend a hundred thousand pounds on actually trying to trace . But spending that hundred thousand pounds as we were told at the time, would only part solve the problem. The potential deficit on the poll tax collection fund er because of these people not registering is well over million pounds and that by spending the hundred thousand proposed here, would actually bring it down to seven hundred and thirty five thousand pounds and that's where the conjuring trick is er this er amendment because of course, if you work out the increase in the balances that you are proposing to take in this amendment, it works out exactly to seven hundred and thirty five thousand pounds, well it does on my calculations Mr Mayor. Exactly seven hundred and thirty five thousand pounds. So you're doing exactly what we were telling you to do a few weeks ago, that you had to er take money out of reserves or you had to cut down on the level of services if you were to avoid putting that thirty four pounds on the council tax bills this year. And you very cleverly, very cleverly and I, this is where I congratulate you, built this in to your proposals tonight. There are some things in this that obviously we can support, the delete or reduction in the contingency pros p provision to a hundred thousand pounds, we're going to be moving later on to delete even that amount but it's surprising you were telling us you've been telling us for years you have to have two hundred thousand pounds in the contingency. All of a sudden in a matter of two weeks, you can take a hundred thousand pounds out of it. We welcome the reduction in the job evaluation budget to fifty thousand pounds. The officers told us er some time ago that that could be done quite easily. If the officers could tell us that why didn't they tell the controlling labour group, I'm sure they did and then the question is why didn't you listen to them. Why then did you put over a hundred thousand pounds in that budget in the first place? I welcome that particular proposal. You questioned Mr Mayor at the city board when I put forward the proposal to increase the er turnover figure from three percent to four percent. You said, explain that councillor Evans, tell us how you're going to do it. Well perhaps you or somebody on the other side might care to tell us how you're gonna take it from three to three and half, cos I'll quite happily tell you then how we'll take it from three and half to four percent, so we welcome that as a step in the right direction. Obviously as I say, we would support the additional bid of a hundred thousand for pursuing the poll tax er non-registers. And obviously we would want to take money out of reserves, our original amendment took one point three million pounds out of reserves and it's interesting to see now that you're suggesting almost that figure again and yet for years you've been telling us you can't take this money out of the reserves, er you know we had to keep it for a rainy day. Do we take it that the rainy day has finally arrived? I think it has. But this does not go far enough for us and er shortly we will be moving another amendment which will take the council's budget down to the standard spending assessment and I will speak to that er when I come to move that amendment. No the standard spe spending assessment. Could I, just before I sit down, say one thing er why I disagree er with councillor . I think the liberal democrats are gonna find themselves rather strangely isolated here this evening, proposing the highest budget. Ah well we will wait and see erm, they're trying to solve everybody's problems but ours, er with all this talk about spending money on education, sorting out the traffic problems erm, it's a pity they don't spend a bit more time in their budget calculations in dealing with the problems of this council and not those of the county council. So Mr Mayor, for completely different reasons than the council have er I will be urging my group to vote against this amendment and to support a subsequent amendment which will take the budget down even further. Thank you. Councillor wishes to speak. Thank you Mr Mayor I just wanted t to come in with two fairly quick points er as to why I will not be able to support this amendment, but the first is that the leader of the council has indicated that the efficiency savings erm has got as far as it can go and that, you know, we have been trimming at the margins and there is no more margin left and that leads you to believe that perhaps one should be looking at somewhat more er root and branch type of pruning in the spending that that the labour group want to actually erm deal with, er and the second point I would like to make, and er I thank councillor for giving us a a a a new word tonight obfuscation because that describes exactly what I think the labour group are trying to do by bringing this figure down it removes the embarrassment they would have from having to add on a substantial sum of money f due to the failure to collect the cou er the community charge in previous years and I think that they are trying by by this amendment with some very quick foot work to try and delude the people of this city. Mr Mayor, councillor says that the labour group is running the council, that's manifestly not the case. The conservative group is running the council. And the conservative group is running the council in the sense that labour has scrambled, obviously over the last few days, to reduce its tax level to something closer to the tories and I'm going to stand with my fellow liberal democrats tonight and vote for a higher figure because, not only because I think that there's sort of things we want to do in our budget, are b are b are better and and would be better done than not done, but because I think there's a fundamental political ethical issue here and it's one which has been confronting this country for a great many years and which is going to be crucial in the next election. The question is, do the people of Britain believe in paying higher taxes for good services delivered by central and local government? I thought that progressives, political progressives in this country were prepared to stand by public services and believe in them sufficiently to say this will cost you and we are prepared to to put the bill to you because we believe you will pay the bill. What we have tonight is a labour group that says they no longer believe in that philosophy. What they believe in is that everybody out there is out to grab as much as they can for their own private interest and they're prepared to meet them halfway on that. There's no question who's running the council here, it's this lot. Reference to I think that last comment is of course a very interesting one . I thought the liberal democrats failed abysmally at that the last election. Can you say Mr Ashdown may have all the qualities of leadership except . And I suspect that the next election that will still prevail. But clearly the liberal democrats have not learnt the lesson of spending what you have and running prudent budgets. Even president Clinton is learning that, even as a democrat he had a reputation of fiscal responsibility as a government, but I must admit I welcomed his present er proposals in that regard. But that doesn't follow for the liberal democrats in this particular council. I don't think their proposals in that regard will be worthy of support. Er, but councillor other remark about the labour party moving towards the conservatives is of course a very fair one, but then surely nothing surprises us at the moment about the labour party. At long last they've come out in favour of wealth, isn't that extraordinary, reported in today's paper. They're also, Mr Mayor, interestingly coming out in favour of the individual but I must admit I applaud that and at long last in some, admittedly very modest way, er they are moving, I won't say to fiscal responsibility, but at least they're learning the lessons of the recklessness of the past of their policies. But what we have to bear in mind of course er the f financial propriety of this council would in a sense have been very easy over the years if the labour party previously had trimmed its budget according to what we could all afford. That they did not do and now the leader of the council said well they're trying to get down to the standard spending assessment at last, he could have done that a long time ago, you have had nothing but excess expenditure proposals on behalf of this city for many, many years. If we are above government guidelines it is the labour party's fault and if indeed we are penalised in the future it is the labour party's fault, none other and to the extent that you run the risk now by having this excess eleven percent budget over the er standing expenditure assessment er will once again unfortunately find you guilty in that regard. What I did find very distressing in his remarks, er were basically in respect of some of the savings . Again I must say it seems extraordinary doesn't it that er he pontificates the savings when really one is entitled to ask the question well why weren't they made before? I really can't think that you can claim those as savings. They're a pulling back of your excess expenditure. They are if you like a correctness of mismanagement. It can't be anything else, formal savings is not on and I think when you small items I was rather distressed by some of them. I think we're going to go as a council in the direction of not answering letters on time. In business that cost is one of the first items you do in efficiency terms. If you delay the answering of letters, of course that creates more letters chasing up the first ones and that is again where you are getting your priorities wrong, admittedly on a very small items. For the leader of the council to use the excuse in terms of savings about the cost of the burning of the dead. I think most of us have due respect and regard for proper procedure in that regard. One of the most emotional times for anyone. For you to downgrade that and say well I'm sorry now we're doing all this, we can't guarantee that, it's disgraceful, absolutely disgraceful. What I actually said was that the price that we would have to charge for burying the dead had to go up in order to ensure that in of the circumstances our standards could remain impeccable. That I regard as unfortunate . I'm very glad you clarified that Mr because certainly I not as I heard it er and I'm very pleased that was clarified and I think others would have felt likewise. Let me come on, let me come on then to a more disgraceful excuse er that er the leader of the council talked about. He talked about the stress on the people we employ. Most of us who've been on this council some years will have seen the stress that the labour party brought on a number of senior officers who felt obliged to leave in what I would call distressing circumstances. That was the pressure of the labour party policy and if there is any stress on staff in this council then it is at your responsibility. You are running this council and it up to you to ensure that you do not create employ because if that is what you're admitting to you're Councillor you've had over your time Thank you very much well I've been very pleased to make those points relating to the leader of the council. Since there are no further hands rushing up into the air I'll say a few words myself. Asking I think the proposals the labour group's . It's important that we look at the pattern of our spending as a local authority over the past five or six years. But that in some of the comments that have gone before. In those days the government assessed local authority needs according to a very in the grant related expenditure assessment, G R E A, greas and this is much more complex and sensitive measure of how much it costs to run a city and in those days what the government thought we should be spending and what we thought we should be spending seemed in fact to be very close indeed. In nineteen eighty seven, eighty eight, we spent ninety nine point eight eight percent of what the government thought . In nineteen eighty eight and eighty nine we spent ninety eight point two nine percent and in eighty nine ninety, ninety seven point one four percent of what the government thought we need we actually underspent in their terms. This was still a labour council, they were still a conservative government but there was a wonderful consensus about the spending needs of local authorities and how local authorities should be funded. That was what one might call a pre-poll tax consensus. In nineteen ninety one the S S A was introduced as the measure for assessing local authority needs and in that year our spending, instead of being one or two percent below what the government thought, it shot up to forty nine point nine five percent above the S S A figures. What had happened? Had labour suddenly become a local authority, or did the S S A simply fail as an accurate way of assessing our spending needs? The answer I think, lies in the fact that the government next year gave this authority an increase in its S S A of some thirty two point one percent, one of the largest increases in the country. Not quite enough perhaps but still enough to be an admission that they got it seriously wrong in the year before. Since that point though what has been the pattern of our budgets? Have we kicked against the and ignored the determination of central government to bolster their own problems with the P S B I by reducing local authority spending? No, from that figure of forty nine point nine five percent above S S A in nineteen ninety one we proposed a budge that had brought reductions year on year in that divergence of view. Each and every year there have been reductions. In nineteen ninety one the gap narrowed to thirty one percent from almost fifty nine. In ninety two, three it narrowed further to twenty two percent and this year we're proposing a budget that is only ten point eight percent adverse to the government's figures. We don't believe that the government is correct in their view of what the city needs. But we've not wilfully put at risk services or jobs by risking capping by going in the opposite direction. Equally we've tried not to traumatise the public or our staff by cutting back to the governments preferred level all at once. Our view is that the people of this city value the services the council provides and don't want them withdrawn. Ours has been a process of careful pruning year on year. It's not been without pain and I pay tribute to our staff's willingness to embrace the changes that we've had to make. In particular I think it should be recognised that the role of the unions, NALGO and G M D in helping that process of change has been quite fundamental and for that reason, because we appreciate and value the essential way in which the unions have contributed to the process of changing the organisation I consider that the they much trailed proposals from the opposition groups to cut, or in the other case, to reduce the NALGO office are quite misguided . I want to return however to the question of the pattern of taxation in the authority under labour control. It's of course only to be expected that people should moan about the tax they've got to pay and people always complain that it seems to go up every year. Well let me say quite clearly now, that is not true. Both as a percentage of budget and in real terms accounting for inflation, people are being asked to pay less today than they were in nineteen eighty eight. In eighty eight, eighty nine the rates, business and domestic, amounted to eighty one point seven percent of all the council's spending. The government contributed just eighteen point two percent so the bulk of our expenditure was born by local people directly. Today we're asking local people to pay only fifty seven percent instead of eight two. But politicians always speak in terms of percentages and real terms so let's look at the total tax which was demanded from people in the city in the past few years. In nineteen ninety, ninety one we asked for six point four seven four million in poll tax. In ninety one ninety two, five point four. In ninety two, three by point six seven and in the budget we propose tonight we've asked for four point five five million. No no allowing for inflations, no underlying trends under the labour proposals people in Cambridge will be paying less hard cash now than they did eight years ago. The council is spending prudently and efficiently and it's spending as little hard cash as is compatible with meeting the essential needs of the people who live in the city. I'm told I've got to wind up I have the discretion to give myself up. But you'll be relieved to know I'm not going . In that case Councillor has . Can we move to the vote then please on the amendment before us I proposed to take it. As point of order I believe as this is a proposal of an amendment of the city board city board is the city board chair's right of reply. Do you wish to exercise your right to reply? Very, very briefly indeed erm I would stand by what I said in my overall speech. I do think that the Erm, it doesn't matter what I propose, whether it actually makes out things that they've been talking about or whether it's completely found something to criticise about it. That's politics. What we've actually got here is a judicious budget proposal which yes, has changed over the last fortnight, I make no apologies for that. It also has to hinder to recognition of what the needs of the people of the city are and I actually cast out, wipe out services and the needs of central administration which is essential to any council and I would hope that not only my own back this amendment. Thank you. Can I ask us to to move the amendment erm in one A those in favour of that part of the amendment please show one A. What are we voting on? from the housing committee and nine thousand pounds from the environment committee were the following additional savings. Roman numeral one, those in favour please show. Those against please show. Roman numeral two please show in favour Thirty two. And those against roman numeral three, those in favour please and those against right. In B add at the end roman numeral one, those in favour please show . Thirty one Mr Mayor. And those against roman numeral two those in favour and those against roman numeral three those in favour and those against amendment D to read one two to eight O O nine please in that budget to thirty six three eight nine fifty, those in favour. Thirty two. And those against. In three alter the amounts calculated to read as follows, I hope that we can take that block in three as one since it all follows from what's gone before. Yes we have erm those in favour thank you, and those against okay thank you. Are there further amendments? Thank you councillor . Okay councillor can you proceed? Does everyone have a copy of this one good er Mr Mayor erm all budgets are a balance between er spending on database services and spending on capital projects and on keeping taxes down. All three elements have to come in to any budget decision and nobody can ignore all three, indeed if you look around three groups of the council you'll see that all the budget proposed tonight will take into account all three areas. Conservative budget for example even though its main press is always on keeping the tax level down er will often include capital projects. For example they support the market square project and at the end of the day even with the total budget down to S S A the vast bulk of the money being spent by conservative budget's been spent on people salaries but it's still being spent on services and the labour party this year has lost the three elements keeping the tax down and that's quite a good thing to see. Though I should say that what councillor said that my group were prepared to set a higher tax level if that were necessary. That's what we said at the general election. By my judgement as the amendment reflects is that it isn't necessary but if it were I would have no hesitation s whatsoever in increasing the level of taxation to pay for what needs to be paid for. It needs to be understood that what divides the parties isn't so much that one party believes in capital projects, on party in revenue spending and one party in keeping the taxation levels down. What divides them is solely of judgements on the bounds between those three elements. I should say that for us revenue services, ordinary database services do come first keeping the tax level does come second and the prestige projects, even rather good ones like the market square project definitely come third. It's not to say that we are against capital projects, we are not. We have included in our proposal this year twenty thousand revenue effects of a hundred thousand pounds capital bid on traffic calming and other similar measures, something which is very popular around the city, as long as you ask people what they want first and which in previous years we put forward as a revenue bid. We decided the best way to deal with that question is through a capital bid and that's what we've done. And also of course there is the question of Parkside Pool although observant members of the council will notice that Parkside Pool isn't mentioned in our amendment. That is because, fortunately I suppose,our Parkside modernisation scheme we are reliable informed by officers, would have no revenue effects in ninety three, ninety four. It would have revenue effect of course in ninety four, ninety five and our future budget will have to reflect that. But in this year the first year of the project, because it will be towards the end of the year anyway it has no revenue, net revenue effect. the basic day to day problems that we want to concentrate on and on the challenges it faces. Education fund is in there we've not raised the price but that is our top priority and we believe it's societies top priority also in our amendment is our idea for extending concessionary bus fares for journeys within the city to those of school age who do not quality for the statutory schemes run by the county. The idea there is to try to get some reduction, some reduction in the level of traffic at peak hours and to help public transport. And of course in a scheme like that many details have to be worked out especially in negotiations with the bus company for the figure we have put in is I think a realistic figure for the first year of the scheme. We also want to bring about improvements in some well appreciated services. Services the council provides which we think could benefit from extra resources. The example of this of course is the night time call out service, which all parties support, which comes every year as a problem of funding, do we want a full week service? And we do, the question is can we afford it and we think we can. These services of course have to be paid for and we do aim to keep the level of taxation as low as possible but of course we can't aim to bring it down as far as conservatives would want because we need, we in the city need, to spend money on things like the education fund without which it becomes a city less worth living in. But we are looking f for savings to make greater efficiencies and we think we've found some. I'm gonna start with the support for trade unions small item twenty six thousand pounds to the NALGO project, there's a G M B budget but that's all nearly all paid for out of direct services we don't want to touch that. This county pays for a full time union official this is extravagant, one full timer for five hundred members, that is way over the top let me tell you. I'll give you one example the union of communication workers for the post office has one full time worker, one full time officer for two to three thousand. So we propose to cut that support by half in this year and to keep it under review for future years as well. Because we want to see a review of the whole system of union representation within the council to see whether it's an appropriate sort of representation for an organisation of this size. We are not against unions, we are for unions, unions can be very useful not only for their members but also for the management, we recognise that. The amount of money put in by the public. I would say to you you've already spent seven minutes of your time erm now allow you seven minutes in initially also and so Well St Aldate's in the Civil War is quite a problem to talk about really, erm in half an hour, because it's so enmeshed in the story of Oxford in the Civil War which is a long, very interesting one, so what I'm going to try and do is erm to pick out some of the local landmarks that did survive in the 17th century and relate them to what we know about some of the people and in this short half an hour, just try and picture what it was like to live in St Aldate's during the civil war. Obviously a whole lot else is . I think it's quite important to orientate ourselves first, and you're looking at a map of Oxford in 1643, erm and 17th century maps for the most part are what we should call upside down. The north is at the bottom, and I think it helps if you stop thinking about it as a map and you think about it as a birds-eye view, a helicopter view, erm and then the whole thing begins to make sense. erm Now, what you've got there is a slightly later map of 1675, which is exactly the same, the north is at the bottom, I'm afraid the top is not very obvious, if I could just hold it up, you've got the castle there, and you've got it the right way up, and actually there's some writing as well. erm And the reason I've given you that one is that that was drawn in 1675 by David Loggen, and it's a very, very accurate one, and it's rather easier to see some of the places I shall be talking about, so I think it's a nice one for you to have close up. erm There are some little differences which are quite interesting too. Now, if we find Carfax first in the middle, Oxford's on the crossroads principle, like so many cities, we've got St Giles down here, erm and Oxford of course a small city, or we should regard it as a very small city. It was still a walled city, the walls were all virtually intact, the castle was a bit ruinous, but it was there, and it had its four a fax machine then? they they Mm. Er a lot of time wh when when you get a fax er and they not deliver to us, half a day late or The whole idea of erm a fax is to get the thing there quickly isn't it?if it's sort of sitting up on a desk for three days before they bring it down. Oh! Your fax has been here for about a week now, I'll bring it down for you . Mm. What's the problem? Talking about faxes. Oh. Well don't u er don't use the fax machine use the one in the office. What's the number for that one, anyway? Er What a memory. Yeah. , yeah. Mm. Mm. Bloody catalogue. I'll chuck in the bin. Never know, you might have won something. No. Congratulations, you have won a holiday to Canada. That'd be nice wouldn't it? I have registered. That doesn't matter. They not deliver to you. A mail catalogue is not I know. They just leave them in the post room don't they? communal. literally they said they stop your your personal mail. Mm. I mean if you It's only cos they're too idle to cart these catalogues and things about. They don't care. When me and Frank were in the in Lo in London we got about fifty of these bloody E mail catalogue come in the same address. The trouble is, people register for er with them because they they're offering No. a free pen or something like that. No they're not. They do sometimes. They give them a some of the information. They must be able to buy a database of the people's name Mm. a lot of the the junk mail. Mailsort. Mm. Yeah the amount of crap I get through the place you wouldn't believe it. All different titles. Doctor and erm er Head of Research and er things like that you know? They're just guessing. junk mail. Oh yeah. P C magazines and stuff. Oh shit . How am I gonna get her bloody number then? If I sent that today it'd be there Wednesday morning wouldn't it? If you sent tomorrow still be there. If I put first class on here. Fuck . So where's Ian ? He's on leave. What for two days? The only day I actually wanna see him and the bastard's on leave. What, today only? As far as I know, yeah. Oh, how did I do that?. you can You can reach her. You say look I'm student, right,I lost the th address of the er whom to send to and I've got an assessment to send in but I don't know how the hell I'm gonna send it on. So can you er give me the details? I'm sure George has got it actually. Oh, bloody hell . It's just one little slip of paper in an envelope, and they always send it separately. They never send it with the No, they send it in a bloody big one. With everything. Well they didn't this year. They do. It came in a small erm small envelope. It did. Cos I remember, I remember picking it up and reading it, I was out in the garden at the time. They send about half this size. Always they do. That's A four. Half the size. paper is A four, you fold it into erm in there they got er c three or four paper as well, they tell you about all these er tutorials. Yeah. Everything in it. The the day of your tutorial, your tutorial's name, Ring him up. Ow! Give him a tinkle. Tut. Time does the mail go from here? Mm? What time does the mail go from here? From here? Mm. About three o'clock. I think the erm the the post'll come about four o'clock I think. It should be by four o'clock is collect every single mail on-site,sort it all out, internal or external. Mm. I know er the if you go there before four o'clock But usually they er they Ah! Tut. Well I'd better get on with my berno binomial theorem then. I need a new pair of jeans. Look at the state of these things. all frayed, pockets are frayed So did the train come on time? On Friday? Yeah, yeah, she was there. I was actually late getting there. So much traffic on a Friday afternoon. Very good. the bypass. Did go on the bypass. That's where the problem was. Yeah, but if you go on the Ha! That's what I'm after. Nothing really at the moment.

I'd a proper I had a proper drill, oh you're talking about the new ones? No. There was three. Oh that's right. Yes. That's why I was a bit confused Oh they should be a drill non-plated, and a drill plated. Yeah, we got P T H,through hole That's cool! non-plated and drill. And exactly what I would of said. What's drill ? I dunno. How do you know? You haven't even thought about it screw head! Anyway, what can I do? He always makes out that it's his idea doesn't he? Oh yeah, I knew that would work! ! What a bastard! But you got a red light there look! You go on regardless and there's a bloody red light down there! Yeah, well I I tried to get rid of it but it wouldn't go. Urgh, don't spit on my cheek! I'm not actually! Erm going to graphic centre. That's right. There's no room for my share. Put it away! What? Chaps, integrity them toge Anyone? Did you get your ? Sorry? And have a game of . Know what I caught on Wednesday night do you?! Family. I got . Yeah, wouldn't be so bad . Right, solder resist. Yeah, it was true wasn't it? Oh sorry! That's the one I want ! I'm only winding you up! Na oh yeah go, go through the solder resist go on. Oh , make your bloody mind up boy! There. Right. Re-draw. Right when those blue ridge tooling holds up you wanna put a big resistor down there. Two length holes. Oh, the things! I thought that would generate it automatically. Well it wouldn't. No. Why not? I thought it was from generator to a pipe, couple of hand brakes in there. Give it here! It's it's easy to . Sure , yeah. Now, now watch the burn. I know. Come on! I know!

Just think get like that I said I said she's bound to phone back in a minute! And no doubt, the phone rang. What's the name of the shape? What shape? P L C C's Ha? With P L C C's. Oh P L C C erm I'll keep going next alright? with hole, I think. Don't . Yeah ! Ha! That's alright, But Oh, I'm lo , I'm looking for parts here I think. A O, of . Or is it one eight six on there? The ay? Next one down. Are we using the one eight eight? No , no, no, no. Oh we use the one eight six on it. Yeah. How you doing? With hole! I thought that was really descriptive. Oh shit! Cos these are exactly the same except with a well and two erm those four holes missing. Oh this you'll be there all day! Okay, alright. Bing Plated no spot on! I'm impressed! What about the forty eight one? I take it it's P L C C With a hole, yeah. Ah, wrong one! Forty eight, forty eight. No it's forty four. No it isn't. That's okay innit? Excellent stuff! Splendid! Right. So we had to get th the drill table sorted out. That cancels yeah but today, I think don't we? Oh! What's next after this then? Well I've just gotta make sure the drill template's on. Oh well, once this is done. Well we're both back onto erm the wotsit The piston. Oh that's quite good. That's funny, old erm Colin came in and you know that one with a the sort of screen save and the the screen shot of that three- D Yeah. I can't really manage to get a a . I said have a go with it. He sort of think, you know with the balloons on it, so he go he got the mouth part and urgh! Mr gullible! Right, if we do a whole list. Remember VMMT. VM, MT? You what? Have a to the whole list. Those are plated through holes. Ah! Fifty, sixty? Ah that's why, fifty doesn't . VMMT. V M M T V, I reckon. V or B. Fifty. Anyway se these are always named upper case so it will always be . Yeah, but you've already got B there for sixty. Oh yeah! V W or something. lum lum la la lum la la lum lum mm . Oh I know, ah! Just type in a minute and I'll Why's that bill still Marking information . Yeah, Bill's got a an amber light. That's right, I can't see anything in Why's that? Cos it's not quite built? Yeah. What's X? Right that one's got the table on instead of the graphics. I don't wanna lose that table, cos I don't want to have to write it all again. Yeah? Mhm. So by That's a sod that isn't it? You do a re-drawing, it disappears ! I hate people who do that! What? These chair covers! It's cos they don't sit in the seat properly, they slouch in them! Make it drag! Ah er what's it like living with you then? Great! Couldn't be better! It's alright for me! Your poor Mrs! No, she's alright. It's an area area select. Right. Okay, what we can do, if we graphics we bind that alright? Okay, then we do points of reference and then we do graphics name symbol, yeah? Aha. Yeah I did this Well the before. You can save it to er erm Simple table. simple table. Oops! Right? Enough? Then you can pull it in. Yeah. Okay, so select a it's a lovely machine! . 's using the ace. ace for er PC's. And it's quite quick. Quite good! Oh you can get it off a pc can you? Yeah, you can, it's only a a demo thing at the moment. It's quite good! Right! Doo do doo . Is it all exactly the same functions then? Same layout as this. Slightly different. Might be a bit different. It's bit of a migration, it can hardly turn its head. What about erm thing? What's it run on V G A? Yeah, it will run on V G A. Run on E G A as well I think. Can't be a very good graphics one. Well I run it on mine next. Can't u , can't use the right. Is it the demo you got from Datatrip Yeah. Right,holeless VMMT V M M T WS. Oh yeah. Seven inch. No.. This to come out. Right, that's all the non-plated ones isn't it? Alright. Shit! What is doing now? Yeah,. The er sump has gone in it. Right that's the the P T H You're not opening into the file are you? No I don't need to. Don't . And you Old with thirty fi , thirty five mill Bit like mine is it? Possibly! Can't remember It having a thirty five mill it might be in the centre of the P L C C's. No, they're big holes ain't they? Huge! See they're huge! Well no, there's a little pad there. A pad, it's it's not a pad it's an actual hole. Oh! Hole with diameter thirty five mill . Thirty five mill ? I do , it doesn't ring a bell actually. Thirty five mill , at all. Norm ! Yes? What uses a thirty five thou hole? Erm Crystals? Crystals is about the only thing that would use it. Can't imagine what's changed it. Why do you have so many different hole sizes? I mean surely you could have a point eight for crystal and still solder ? No, well Or is both sided, soldered? The flow soldered if the hole's too big cos the crystals is thinner. Yeah. It wicks up through. Also erm It's no problem but polystyrene plastics are are very good crystals. Yeah. We're not using polystyrene anyway. There's a thirty three in there. Ah, ha ha ! Uses thirty five mill ? Wah ah oh oh oh Oh. . It's definitely a thirty five. . What would use thirty three Norm ? Yeah, well it's small.. Yeah. Erm He's trying to think. Must have updated the crystals then? It's I think I might have erm used thirty three on the crystals and now the shape's been updated. And there's nothing particularly unusual on that. Crystal's would be erm one eighths And the veers What about the veers? They're quite small. These are twenty fives aren't they? These are twenty , yeah. These are twenty, yeah. Thirty threes, thirty seven forty six, so well thirty threes must be the crystals, thirty fives I don't see what they're gonna be. er sha What letter are you er Oh I'm not worried about the letters at the moment. Just got it sitting in Well it's never had that before, I'm just trying to work out where it's come from. Can't you do a a select? Name select or something and pick out a one of the pads with that hole? No, you can't, there's erm I see. You haven't got anything unusual that's gonna be small. No. Oh I've got a thirth three hold iron or on the er crystals look. Yeah, alright. Tha , that's probably a mistake in the past before we had all this changing. Right. I'll define Cos now we've gone up to thirty fives, I'm pretty sure. Just er They're both the same footprint, those two Sorry? These two are the same footprint. Yeah. What about that one there? Bedge? Oh that's cute! Oh ah Who got that one? Little one there. I think they should all be er I know what it could be! I know what it is! We know what it is. Er What a , what are Zener diodes called, shape? Which ones? Jus Just a normal Zener. It's not on there but Oh erm It's on the back. R four, no D D three over four sixty? Is that a normal , a normal Zener one, Z is is in some ways. I think it uses the same footprint doesn't it? Yeah. Oh hang on, let's let's let's do it the easy way. It's very quick. Two, three and a so sixty that's good innit? Whoops! And si , six, six, six, six, six, six. I bet you pound of thirty fives cos that's a new one machine. That's a new component I put on there and that would be updated , yeah. there. That's what it is. So all the thirty two's have gotta be changed to thirty fives. Well , is it thirty three, or thirty five. Thirty five rings a bell, erm . Oh, find out . I can't find an easy one can I? I could look at the library can't I? Yep. Cos I know they're all up to date. You know the check that went in? Mhm. Something vague with this split window innit in? See if they're in the same file and two different bits two places on the file. It's doing code and you need to change several entries or something. Mm mm. Just split your window. Brilliant! I'm not with you. Well if you've got a big file right? And you're changing all your currencies of a certain variable Yeah. you can have it at the top where you've changed it and then the window underneath you can scan it through the file again. Alright? Brilliant! Nice though. You pick them . Can't you just do a find? Can you Find and replace. wait five minutes? Yeah, you probably can. Cos I've got something to take over, you might as well take them over . Can you find the ye , if is there any yellow pads about? We've gone right out. I'll pick up somewhere. Er, yellow pads? You know the you pull out the information. So what were you up at lunchtime then? Thirty seven is a different one altogether again isn't it Norm? Hang on! Make that the same After you call the same symbol alright? I make it the same size okay? I wouldn't of thought there's sod all difference between thirty three and thirty seven. No. Yeah, but you have to tell it. I'm not ready Norm! Cos it sees both of those holes in the data range. Oh ya! Hey, I saw this bird Norm Yeah. Yeah. That Justin's trying to er Pull pull. but he says he isn't! Don't laugh! He's completely ignoring me now! Now I've seen him interfering with the smoke alarm now! Thought that was quite remarkable! Oh you know that we were talking about What she look like? working here from the pub. Dear oh dear oh dear! Yeah. Still soaring in he with that? What a halibut ! E any good for a titty wank No, no good for a titty wank No, totally bare! A titty wank ! We used to call it breast fucking but that's much nicer! No, too Tha , that's too descriptive. titty wank All calls for a Titty wank tea break and I like that, I like the er the phrasing. Titty wank Titty wank Did you have a titty wank over the er weekend now your wife's back? Ah! No? Not big enough mate! No, nor is that, bloody right ! What the tits or er Well if it was if mine was small I'd be alright on mine. Ah well! Titty wank, I like that ! It's one of the funniest things I've heard for Oh, minutes! Micro-seconds! Urgh, what a horrible colour! Norman's got the bland taste again. Yeah. I didn't set this one, this is bloody he set Oh that's it up! gross! What? Right. Gross of public . Expensive . Yeah, get my posh car. Do you know you could do this? What? Not edit within capitals. Oh the software problem. No I didn't. I asked Daniel to leave. Have they? No. No, no, no, leave the room. Leave the room. It's alright bu get off your high horse! I was just gonna say why? No. Well I don't know. I reckon that Daniel's . Might be. Has he had a bad appraisal then or something. I dunno. Dunno. Kevin had one. Well Kevin's a wanker! His . Erm Well give us a shape to look at then. Can't I get. Sorry? Come on! How long you gonna be? Not long. Z three over four sixty? Good grief! On the score sixty. Mm, mm mm . That's the way . That's what we call innit? What's five thou Thirty five thou for the lo Alright. you take three under sixty. What about fourteen dip and under school osc That's a nice one! I think that was drill under Was any school table. Are you sure? You sure Bedge? Drill un under school osc What the first bit of that cos the thing in your mouth. Fourteen dip under school osc Graphics are crap, look at tha , look at that! Oh! Gone completely ! It's not overwriting it is it? Yes! Right. Have you got nothing else to do apart from squeaking chair? Hasn't bought the bloody letters with it! I'm here,. Dash Thirty three, forty six. fetch ! Have you Bedge! erased that layer? Yeah it's all gone now. Sorry I'll get the old Thirty three paint pot. Thirty three is the oscillator Right it should be thirty three. Well that's what they use in the library so that's a I'll make sure the library ones are correct on mine, alright? What are the other oscillators? Thirty five is point nine. That should be point eight five. Should it? Yeah. So it should be dip , thirty three and Yeah. What's the other oscillator, that one that's you lie flat An eighteen osc or something. It's H C eighteen. H C eighteen. Alright, we're gonna have to do a well hard copy here. Oh shit! That means we're gonna have to rebuild that bloody Hang on! Zoom in. No I think the I think they're there. You might find they're with the scrap. Okay. It's it's no problem. It's found it all has it? Yeah, should of picked it all up. That's right. I gotta rebuild this anyway. What a bugger! Yeah, the erm small oscillator is a thirty three as well. Alright. Ah ha ! So there is a difference between thirty three and thirty five? Correct! Looks that way. I'm gonna delete this one. Although saying that one we sent out to erm Yeah. they actually drew the wall at point nine Or point nine five. oscillated everything. The pads are big enough to take it but when we a , you know that, when we had that problem about the er what's a name coming up? Yeah. The solder coming up, we decided we'd go down to what size it should be. Yeah. Thing is the th The bulk of the drawing rules were such that you got the pin diameter plus you know, their size pads and all this and stuff. Yeah. So we basically done to what that is although they said they were just gonna dri , drill a one point nine five Mm. and sort of run it from there. Well it's a strange fault cos Very. Very! They make a big thing about some things, and then some we're gonna drill all that point nine five anyway! Yeah. They made a big thing about us sort of not using one millimetre holes using Mm. point nine five holes, cos that's standard size But that's that's sod all! Yeah. We wouldn't have used one mill on the sc for out side counters and letters they said oh no, they were gonna use wha you know er what's a name? Mr Point nine five. Yeah. Mr was well upset! Phylis? Well upset! Why? They're gonna charge him for casting his . Well course they are! He's dying though! Poor chap! If he was get, get in off his death bed and in. Serves him And when right! He's got When he did plenty of money anyway! wondered if I should have his place. When is it? Er, tonight. I can't play tonight. I'm already playing tonight. Yeah. John might. Four point three O. Four point three O, okay. Are the printers on? Think so. Ah ga ga ga Yeah, they should be! Is it, ain't worth trying him? I can't think of anyone else. Have to Okay. . What about the other one Mr ? if he's genuinely ill, know what I mean? Yeah. Did he what badly? Got flu or something. Yeah. Sounds well rough! He reckons he might be in tomorrow. Yeah. well rough!

It's no longer there. Yeah, that's bigger than one point three though isn't it? No. Yeah, that is a huge space three points. Oh two point eight this is. Oh sorry, did I say two point eight? Yeah. Yeah. We're looking for Yes that's what it is. Yeah, but let's not use any more. Well, what we'll do we we'll fill these out right and then we'll do a plot info then we gotta find out what actually he has used. Oh God! No, gotta cancel , go on! Hang on, let me save this first. So Cos what it does, it remembers tools tool holes that used to be on there. It's a bit of a pain! No point in saving it. It's lovely doubly Five foot. Just write it on a bit, bit of paper. On there. Haven't got any little cards have you? Not green ones, no. Oh that's true. If you were ni is there cakes up there? No, the guy was the just filling the bar one up. What, not even erm fruit cake?

Yeah, I'm not worried! I'm not is It's gotta be one point two five if that's over there. Yeah, it's about one point two five, yeah. Well a hundred thou is a tenth of an inch innit? Right, hang on a sec cos the K's here You're not going to crap! there's some K's here that don't exist on the board alright? Yeah. Yeah. A tenth of Yeah. twenty five point four. Now he won't ask us.

Right, that's good. Right, so we're using all the others are we? Mm! Twenty thirty three, thirty five, thirty seven, forty, fifty refusing applications for development in the countryside. The fact that it's in the countryside shouldn't be a reason in itself for for refusing permission. Therefore, if if the panel were minded to accept the need for Policy E two we'd have we we consider that there needs to be changes to the wording er in in order erm to make it less restrictive. Thank you for that. Mr Williamson, can I ask for your confirmation that the reason that the Secretary of State deleted Policy E two in the nineteen eighty structure plan was one of the many reasons under the heading, General, there is no specific reference in the notice of approval to the deletion of this policy and therefore I am assuming it fell for one of the reasons given in paragraphs five point two to five point four five. Is that correct please? It's not listed there. But it's nowhere listed in any of the other proposed modifications the Secretary of State or any of the other modifications the Secretary of State made. Chairman, Ken Williamson er North Yorkshire County Council. Er I thought I had my copy of the certainly the panel's report of nineteen eighty available, it it seems to have disappeared somewhere. My understanding of what what the panel said and what the what the Secretary of State agreed was that neither the panel nor the Secretary of State disagreed with the erm the general sense of the policy but felt that that sense was er embodied and and was able to to be applied through the erm provisions of other policies in the plan at that time. Er E one was mentioned I believe and er but the main emphasis was on the range of agricultural policies A one I think to A four. So it seemed to us that the the general sense and purpose of the policy was was not in a sense disputed but that er in order to avoid a leng what was considered at the time to be perhaps unnecessary detail and going into erm too much detail that er we felt that the agricultural land policies could be left to to perform the sort of main objective that we were seeking through, I think it was E three at the time, was was the proposed policy. There is nothing in the notice of approval which says that. No I think erm para five three I think was probably one of the er unless the panel found that some of policies were unduly restricted and detailed or er which were not a struc structural significance erm yeah probably the first rather than the second reference. What unduly restricted? And detailed. And detailed. I think because a the sense Do you have at the time the erm, as I go back to what I said before about the the the reliance which was then place on on the agricultural policies Yes. it seems to me to perform the functions which we were er seeking through through the proposed Policy three. to me that it would be perverse of us to fall into the trap if we were to do so of endorsing Policy E two and not know that what we were endorsing was in fact what the Secretary of State specifically rejected on the grounds perhaps that it was unduly restricted or detailed or inappropriate for some of those other reasons that are set out in the earlier part of that notice of approval. Chairman the erm proposals in the what was the submitted plan in reference seventy nine read er Policy three, Subject to the provisions of Policies I four I eight and I nine there will be a general presumption against development in open countryside except for the purposes of agricultural policy and recreation and other uses appropriate to a countryside location. It does read a bit like a greenbelt policy. That does in fact But erm Policy E two was also deleted at the same time. Yes erm Policy E two was at that time was er relating to programme of tree planting er . I can guess . That was obviously er. Could we trouble you to submit those two policies as they were submitted. E two and E three yes certainly. Thank you. I think that might be a useful point to break for coffee. While and that will give you a chance. Can we resume at twenty past eleven please? Mr Collier? Can you just hold fire gentlemen a moment? It it seems to me we've spent about an hour and ten minutes or so almost shadow boxing over this particular policy erm and we we keep running into well running both matters together and it seems right and proper that we should do that. There is obviously a divergence of view as to whether there's a need for this policy. Erm there's also a view been expressed that well if you're going to have it it may need some more guidance than is presently written into it. I think that's Mr Sedgewick's view if you have it. Erm the other point of course, this is raised in matter B, as it's written is it considered to be restrictive too restrictive er and third and secondly, is it giving you er guidance which properly reflects national guidance. And Mr Donson er has said that he doesn't think it, it in fact exceeds that. So can sort of we point the discussion in in that direction but before we do Miss Whittaker has a corollary to push with that point. Thank you Chairman. I think in fact what I would like in particular from the local planning authorities around the table is given Mr Donson's view that E two as drafted is more restrictive than national guidance P P G seven or any other P P G, what is it in North Yorkshire that justifies that departure from national guidance. This in my view is a critical determinate of leaving aside the question of fifty of fif the application of section fifty four A that determines whether the policy is required. Mr Earle. Thank you Chairman. We've now moved on in part of question your question five B and erm in my response to that I'm suggesting, and I hope it's not just semantics, picking up the point made just before we broke for coffee, is that there's all sorts of things called the countryside, and this policy is is directed at the open countryside. Now I've heard about you know the question of definition of where the edge of the open countryside is and that's a valid point but if we if we have in mind the open countryside, it seems to me that P P G seven does clearly differentiate between the countryside, the countryside, rural areas and the open countryside where it refers to development being strictly controlled. Now this phrase strictly controlled erm I I I wanted to ask it myself because I you know trying to push it through to what it actually means I think the county council if you like has taken it at what may be face value and said well strictly controlled must mean something. It must mean that there is a er an approach that says that development in the open countryside isn't normally permissible erm unless unless unless. But at least it I don't see that that that E two is inconsistent with the phrase development in the open countryside being strictly controlled. Because then the P P G seven then goes on to make the implicit point about other things that in the countryside such as the small villages and towns and other development opportunities, do occur which provide the rural diversification and employment development that is that is required by the P P G. Mr Williamson . Oh I've lost my er Ah, it's alright. Your billy do then. Thank you Chairman. Ken Williamson North Yorkshire County Council. Er Chairman I I really have to say I don't I don't really agree with the assertion that the policy is is essentially more restrictive than than er P P G seven will indicate and I would endorse what er Patrick Earle has said in in that regard. Erm the policy that we were putting forward is is essentially not the one that er was was debated in nineteen eight. It seem to me erm that was er much more intended to be much more restrictive I think than than I would suggest our policy E two is now. Erm it it in a sense er smack of sort of greenbelt policy I think . I don't think our er proposed policy two does that. In considering or interpreting what strict control means for a start erm do we actually mean, does P P G seven actually mean strictly control? If so what what does that imply? It's not sort of er moderate control or a little bit of control it is strict control. Er and we are talking about open countryside outside erm rural settlements and if you look at the wider countryside and that includes in my judgement er the pattern of settlement which is where most people actually do live in in the countryside. They're they're not living out in the in the sticks the vast majority of people, they actually live in in settlements. The policy er doesn't prevent or doesn't seem to prevent er proper development which is associated with settlements in rural areas. And there are other policies in the structure plan erm you know we shouldn't be looking at this policy just in isolation. We have a whole host of policies, some of which give guidance on erm controls in the open countryside but other ones actually sort of seek a more positive attitude to the problems and the needs of rural diversification. Erm I've mentioned one or two some of the industrial land policies as they er as they still stand policy in in structure plan policy I eight I think and particular policy I six doesn't preclude reasonable and necessary development taking place in rural areas. If one looks through P P G seven erm one sees lots of references to villages and settlements and erm more activity taking place, more people moving into those settlements. When we look at the open countryside it doesn't really to my mind say a great deal about er what is what should be considered acceptable. Erm para one ten I mean it talks about the countryside being able to accommodate many forms of development without detriment. It then goes on to say of course new development in relation should be sensi sensitively related to existing settlement patterns. And there are other references throughout to, what I reply is a clear direction that most developments should be in erm in or closely related to settlements and, of course, that will be a matter addressed through through local plans. The structure plans giving broad guidance Is it your intention that Policy E two should be interpreted as saying anything different from what is in section two of P P G seven which covers Chairman I think we farm diversification, housing, horses, agricultural development. I think probably the implications and a lot of people have er picked up on this as the policy has developed, is that er well they're they're concerned that the policy is in fact too flexible now because of how it is being interpreted by other people. Certainly this policy is not intended in any way to erm prevent what P P G seven actually seeks er to promote in in the open countryside, ie outside the areas which we would expect most development to take place in. Certainly the the re-use of er adaptation of existing buildings and would have thought that wouldn't be er er something which the county council would want to prevent. And I don't think the policy er as we proposed it er actually does prevent that. As far as the exceptions Mr Donson is rightly concerned about erm affordable housing. The county council is equally interested and concerned about that. What we have in terms of the advice for the open countryside outside the areas that would normally be looked at and allocated for development is the rural exceptions policy that forms part of P P G three. Erm this policy in my to my mind doesn't actually er exclude those exceptions being made. That would be a in the context of our policy a perfectly acceptable addition to the countryside if you like. Provided that I mean we're not talking about rural exceptions being erm appropriate everywhere and anywhere. Even with the exceptions policy there's still consideration of the the impact of that development and whether it would be acceptable or not and would be treated in in those terms I'm sure by the districts. And I'm sure the districts a lot has been said about er it being the districts' view that well you know we've got this policy so we will we will exercise a high level of restraining to protect the countryside against all comers etcetera etcetera. I don't really think that's a fair reflection of what er what what the district councils as I understand it er would intend to do. Do I take it your answer to my question is no? Yes. Thank you. Mr Jewitt and the Professor Lock. Er Michael Jewitt Hambleton District Council. Er there are three points erm I'd like to make. Erm the first point erm er Mr Donson's Mr Donson's comments. Erm Mr Donson seemed to accept that it was er right for local planning authorities through their district wide open plans to give effect to policies in P P G seven for protecting the countryside for its own sake and he er mentioned landscape policies and then development minutes amongst other things. In the context of those comments my question really, Isn't it right er for local authorities to expect that there is some strategic basis for their policies in the structure plan? Erm and I I can't help wondering, this is perhaps something that Mr Donson may well want to come back to, erm what Mr Donson's position would be at subsequent local plan inquiries where local plans were to contain such policies and there was wasn't to be a strategic basis er for those policies. And I would, and this is my second point, I would point out to erm erm point out to the panel erm that the structure plan at present erm only erm mentions in landscape terms in countryside terms those at statutory designated areas. The rest of the countryside is in effect erm a white area which tends which to me erm in a county context tends to convey the impression that er countryside issues do not matter across the rest of the countryside and that's clearly not the intention of Government advice and it's clearly not the intention behind the statutory of the structure plan which has a strong environmental basis. I think it's right and proper that there is a strategic policy which erm emphasizes protection for the countryside across the whole of the area. The third point er relates to erm is the policy stricter than Government guidance? Erm my view is that it's erm it's very flexible. Erm the margin of flexibility in the policy has yet to be determined because it will be local plans which give effect to erm erm what is erm what development needs to the statement of what development needs to be in the countryside. And that's something that can be debated through local plan inquiries. But there is the mar there is considerable potential for flexibility in the policy and that would be determined my local planning authorities in the light of P P G seven but also in the light of er local circumstances and conditions which is quite right and proper. Professor Lock. In the spirit of erm words after coffee sir, er no more shadow boxing some straight shots here. Erm in response to er Miss Whittaker's question we did not hear of anything special in this county that justifies the policy in excess of that exceeds should I say erm national guidance. There was no answer given to that question by anybody. Secondly we have not heard of anything that has changed in this county since nineteen eighty sufficient to warrant or justify in this alteration the addition of a policy the effect of which, one one with a similar effect having been thrown out at that time. And thirdly, there is a Government obstruction they don't like policies which are presumptions against development. Policy E two as proposed is a very common form of phrasing used by planning authorities to circumvent the Government objection to presumption against policies. The policy as proposed says, Development in the open countryside will not normally be permitted. If that is not in practice a policy which is presuming against development in the open countryside I don't know what is. Fourth, we've heard from Mr Williamson his interpretation of what strictly controlled means. The phrase from P P G seven. And what we can see is that Mr Williamson's interpretation of strictly controlled means not normally be permitted. And that is not strict control that is not normally be permitted. Strictly controlled should mean consented after the most careful deliberation and under the most carefully contrived er conditions. North Yorkshire's interpretation I repeat is not strictly controlled means not normally be permitted. And none of this would matter Chairman I don't think er whether E two whether E two was in or out of the structure plan only matters in so far as it bears a part of the making of local plans and the making of planning applications in the county. On the first point about the making of local plans, we're hearing that this policy has the great support, in fact was requested by all the districts in the county. I don't think they've seen it's obverse side. Having E two in place is alright for the local planning authority that wants a local plan that has no development in the countryside in it. You would be drawing sucker from E two in your anti-development policies in your local plan. So that works doesn't it? But supposing a local authority in its local plan wanted to allocate land for development in what is currently open countryside. And as I was saying to Terry Heselton over coffee it could be Selby looking for its two hundred and fifty hectares. You're never going to find those in existing towns and villages. Now supposing a local authority that wants to go into a open countryside in its local plan, E two would stand in the way of that. Such allocation would be contrary to county structure plan Policy E two. Now what we could say is well there would be trust. We have to trust the districts can trust the county the county can trust the districts and that in practice they would make this work at local plan level. For the development industry this that sort of concept of trust isn't safe enough. Section fifty four A makes your local plan structure plans extremely important governors on what happens on the ground and it's for that underlying reason that we find E two unjustified and reasonably repressive and an unreasonable extension of constraint by the county on the freedom of districts in their local plans to choose the geography of their of land allocations. Mr Earle and then Mr Donson. Thank you Chairman. Patrick Earle Richmondshire District Council. Erm I wonder if can just er continue slightly the debate about the nineteen eighty erm decision to exclude the then Policy E three. Erm I I'm speaking from recollection sir at having looked into this in the context of planning appeal which is now a little while ago, but it did strike me at the time that er there was a definite feeling that the agricultural issue was very strong protection of ag agricultural land throughout was a strong issue up to er the mid nineteen eighties and certainly was up to the time in late seventy nine early nineteen eighty and er therefore there was a feeling that Policy E three simply er was supplementary to those other policies. Also at the time I don't think that in terms of national recognition that the idea of protecting the countryside for its own sake was terribly well developed. Erm to an extent it it was er on the back of protec protection of agricultural land. Now of course during the nineteen eighties the protection of agricultural land for its own sake er lost weight as an issue and the relevant structure plan policies er lost effective weight and were seen to do so but Government policy was quite explicit in the nineteen eighty seven circular, I think it was num number sixteen, was that although agricultural land protection as a farming resource was diminished as an issue, the protection of the countryside for its own sake was not. And, therefore, the sit situation where you find yourself today erm is not the same as it was I think in nineteen eighty. Erm the second point I'd like to make is er we danced round this phrase presumption this morning, I've tried to avoid using it because its its it gets all sorts of er connotations going. I read in the Planning Press that the Newbury District Council managed to browbeat the the Department of Environment into accepting the phrase in their in a local plan, so perhaps presumptions are er the word presumption may or may not be acceptable, but then to extend it into saying well you can't even say, not normally be acceptable, and, not normally be er agreeable, for any sort of policy er means that strategic policies or general policy approaches are simply ruled out ri right across the board. And I'm sure that's not really er acceptable. And finally, if I may, the question you raised earlier and I didn't respond to it as erm I might of done, er the question about whether North Yorkshire is particularly unique. Well plainly erm whatever the er Yorkshire people may think and I was born in Nottinghamshire, erm that it is you know you cannot say it is absolutely unique. But I would like to refer you to the erm notice of approval of the nineteen eighty structure plan where I think erm there there is a phrase to the effect that a policy of broad restraint of development is erm erm er accepted by the was accepted by the then Secretary of State on the basis of the high environmental quality of the county. And that doesn't just refer to the A N Bs and the national parks and the rest of it. Erm important though they are they do not cover the the great majority of the county. The countryside in the county is is undesignated area erm outside the area er the the main designation. But that that phrase in the structure plan approved in nineteen eighty I think does give some weight to to what we're trying to address this morning. Roy Donson House Builders' Federation. I think mo a lot of the points I wanted to make were were covered by Professor Lock but I would just draw the panel's attention to erm the policy that was rejected. And if you take into account that the words, A general presumption against, were common phraseology in policies in the nineteen eighties and we now use the er play against presumption we now have to use the phrase, Will not normally be permitted. I would suggest to you that given that and also the wording in the justification under the old Policy E three, that in fact you could hardly get a tissue paper between this policy that is now before you and the previous policy. They are in fact almost one and the same and they use er one and the same justification. And so it seems to me that what has got to be proven, and I come back to the point, is that something has changed and we haven't heard anything that has changed er in in that time. In fact the justification er for the present policy actually talks about erm the erm, This policy has generally been successfully implemented across the county. That is concentrating development in partic particular places. So it seems to me that there is nothing new there is no further justification and er on those grounds alone there is no reason to have this policy. Mr Heselton and Mr Allenby. Thank you sir. Terry Heselton Sel Selby District. Erm it seems it seems to me that wha what's crucial here is the er the spirit behind the policy or or rather the the way in which it's going to be interpreted. And I'd I'd like to turn to the point that erm Professor Lock raised in in terms of the potential clash of interest if if you like between the restraint of of the policy and the er the development proposals as regards Sel Selby district. But nothing has has really changed it's surely implicit that green field sites will have to be released to meet the justifiable needs for development erm that there are ways clearly to minimize the impact by by first redeveloping the existing sites by by releasing sites in less sensitive locations, or developing sites that have minimal impact on on existing settle settlements or patterns of development un unless in exceptional circumstances there is for example the need for a new settlement. But I don't I don't think that the situation's any any different with the proposed policy as regards existing situations. But clearly it it's quite an important point so er so of course I'd be interested to to hear the county council's view on on the point raised. Erm one possible way round the I suppose would be for the county council to amend the explan explanatory memorandum er as a matter of urgency and to bring forward in it er or or at least to acknowledge some of the the matters that have been raised. Such as, for example , erm the affordable housing issue and others. Because clearly in in debating this policy I think a number of the districts have also raised diff different points of interest in terms of what should be recognized as exceptional development and we we went down that that road a couple of years ago and unfortunately the districts came to the conclusion that it wasn't appropriate to try and list the exceptional circumstances. I mean in some respects that's almost an imposs an impossible task it's simple impracticable. As soon as you publish a list for the exceptional circumstances it it will be overtaken by er evolving new forms of development for example. So I don't I don't think anything anything's really changed. There there may well be a way round the problem by amending the explanatory mem memorandum. I I think Selby District Selby District's attitude is is that we're we're perfectly happy. We we think we see eye to eye with the county council on this er provided it is clearly in the the acceptable needs of the district will be met by taking areas of countryside. Erm but I would, as I say, I would like to hear from the county on. Yes Chairman. David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council. It's a similar point to the one that Terry Heselton has has just made. I think my impression was that er Professor Lock was suggesting that because of Policy E two local planning authorities would have some difficulty in in making allocations to meet the structure plan requirement. Now I don't think that's the case. Erm it's obviously right and proper that a local planning authority if it's releasing green field sites has to justify why those sites should be released. And that's er that's a process that we've just been through with the Harrogate and Knaresborough local plan. We have released sites er in the countryside and we expect the countryside protection policy to apply outside the urban areas and outside of the sites that we've allocated for development. So I I don't think that er would would cause a problem. I'd like to pick up on a point that er that Roy Donson made also right at the outset of of the discussion and that was that there's no evidence that local authorities have have faced pressure for development in the countryside. And that simply isn't the case. You know we've had intense pressure for development in the countryside, certainly in Harrogate district. Erm quite recently, for example, we've had applications for motorway service areas, that's just one example. And that sort of application has to be considered in the context of countryside protection policies. The need for development has to be established and so erm I refute the fact totally that there hasn't been pressure for development in the countryside, that's certainly not the case. Er finally I'd like to reinforce what I said this morning about the strategic importance of a countryside protection policy. It's a matter of fact that the strategy of the county council is to locate development as far as possible in and around the main settlements of the county. The corollary of that is that there shouldn't be development by and large in the countryside. And it's right therefore that a policy should express that explicitly within the structure plan. Mr Sedgewick and then Mr Rudd. Sedgewick Michael Courcier and Partners. Er my answer to Miss Whittaker's originating question, there has been no argument at all that the area where this policy will operate, which is the open countryside outside of the A O N Bs and national parks, has got any special character that requires a more restrictive approach than national policy. Indeed Mr Mr Williamson has argued that the policy is not more restrictive than national policy, it is clearly not in the county council's mind that a more restrictive approach is needed. Moving moving on from that point, it does seems to me that the policy clearly is more restrictive than P P G seven and arguably in some respects it's more restrictive than greenbelt. At least in the greenbelt development that is appropriate to rural areas would be permitted. In the proposed E two the only development that would be permitted is that which needs to be in the open countryside and that's a much more rigorous test. Within the greenbelt policy there are there is a list of exceptions, a private strategic level. I think it is appropriate if you are to have an E two policy it is appropriate to apply restrictions to to identify the exceptions in that. I I if it can be done in the greenbelt policy it must be done in E two and there can be no argument that it is not too detailed a matter in greenbelt policy but too detailed a matter in E two. Development in the open countryside would not normally be permitted is the way that the the draft policy's guidance. P P G seven para one ten says that new building in the open countryside would be strictly controlled. Development is far more than new building. Mr Williamson has recognized that the adaptation of existing buildings would be allowed. The policy does not say that, the policy put a strict limitation on all forms of development. As I said earlier I do not think that this is an area where the district councils should be given a completely free rein to interpret the matter within their own local plans. There has to be a strategic theme particularly in counties such as North Yorkshire which is predominantly rural, it is a major area of planning control, fully merits strategic control and that strategic control must be applied or if it if it is to be applied in the structure plan if you do agree that there should be a Policy E two, then the control of development must be applied consistently over the districts. I think within the terms of er P P G seven the scope for discretion is limited. The P P G seven has a very clear theme about supporting rural diversification, it is positively worded P P G. I think the restrictive nature of the existing policy and the district's support for that is something that cannot run forward in the structure plan and be consistent with national policy. Thank you. Thank you very much. Can I pick up on a point that you've just made Mr Sedgewick and also points made by those on your right about exceptions and presumptions. The only place in which a presumption now appears in national guidance is in P P G two and it'll be it is no secret that erm P P G two will be the subject of a revision. It seems to me however that the terms presumption and exception as national guidance stands at the moment go together in the context of greenbelt. And if we are not looking for something which is as restrictive as greenbelt we ought neither to be expressing in whatever terms a presumption or describing something which is permissible as an exception. Would the objections of those on my left this end of the table, if the panel were minded to have an E two policy, be overcome by, Development will only be permitted provided that, and they set a criteria? That's how you finish the sentence Erm yeah I certainly would encourage you down that path Miss Whittaker that if it helps, I don't know whether you've got all the documents, but in our our submissions to the county we suggested that if E two has to survive erm and to add the words, sorry, exactly as you started the sentence but finishing that the exceptions were areas of the sites allocated for development in local plans, it would seem to me to make it absolutely clear what the freedom of local interpretation was in the statutory plan process whilst giving the county the the that it wanted on all the other areas of the county. So erm in response immediate response to your question would be, yes and erm to finish the sentence by referring to areas allocated for development in local plans being okay. Mr Broughton you wanted to come in earlier yep. Frank Broughton Ministry of Agriculture. I think it was Mr Heselton raised the er issue earlier of the wording in the explanatory memorandum and er would certainly regard that as being very important in the interpretation of this policy. Er being an agriculturalist rather than a planner I tend to get a bit confused by higher planning semantics of the difference between strict control and presumption against not normally. Er so what I did was something a bit simpler than that I just went through the memorandum and and ticked off what I regarded as restrictive statements as against positive ones. Er and I think I came up with six negatives and and one very feeble positive. And er if I just run through them in in the amended version as I understand it. Paragraph one talks about generally preventing inappropriate development. Paragraph two er development generally should be the exception rather than the rule er building in the open countryside should be strictly controlled. Paragraph three, discourage most forms of development. Paragraph four, a limited number of exceptions and paragraph seven, promotion of a restrictive approach to development. Now to counteract that the only positive one I could find was, while accepting that some development in the open countryside may prove to be necessary. Now it seemed to me that wasn't a very erm reasonable balance and er comparing that with the with the Secretary of State's recent pronouncements where he talks about local planning authorities needing to breathe fresh life into the countryside through their development plans and I want local planning authorities in rural areas to give the need to diversify the rural economy as much priority priority in their thinking as protecting the countryside and the two go hand in hand, and comparing those two er points I I would I would put to North Yorkshire the question, Do they think that the explanatory memorandum is is consistent with that er policy statement from the Secretary of State? Mr Collier. David Collier National Farms Union. I share the reservations of erm Mr Broughton about the the tone of the policy erm and as Professor Lock was concerned about the interpretation of strictly controlled, erm we are too. Erm I think if someone er told me I need to control my car whilst driving I would have erm one hand on the steering wheel. If somebody told me to strictly control the car I would put both hands on the steering wheel but not necessarily both feet on the er brake pedal. Erm I certainly er would agree that the starting point would be erm a policy which talks of development being permitted in certain circumstances erm and that the county council wishes to support development which benefits the rural economy erm subject to satisfying certain criteria. And I think that to a large extent erm an alternative wording that that we've been working on would erm meet those concerns. Erm I'll be happy to distribute copies but perhaps I could run through that draft quickly now erm and go through what I would say are the advantages. The alternative we suggest is, Development in the open countryside outside the national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, areas that heritage coast and greenbelt, will be strictly controlled. Proposals intended to benefit the rural economy will normally be supported provided that they would not unacceptably detract from the character and appearance and general amenity of the surrounding area. And you will have noted that er much of the wording in that er er latter sentence is taken from the the latest draft of the county council's suggested policy. I would say that the five advantages of our alternative draft is that er it makes it clear that the policy applies to land outside the national parks and so forth but with less repetition than the proposal put forward by the county council. Erm it's secondly more positive in its tone than that erm presently before us. Thirdly that there is no requirement to demonstrate a need to locate development in open countryside erm and we've been reminded this morning that erm one of the erm flaws in the policy put forward back in nineteen seventy nine or eighty erm appears to be that it erm required, certainly in the explanatory memorandum, that the development be erm essential erm to er essentially have a countryside location. Erm the fourth advantage I would say is that it focuses on the balance between the need to promote rural enterprise and the need to protect the countryside. Erm and finally, erm in an effort to make it er acceptable, wherever possible it makes use of the wording already agreed between the county council and interested parties. This wording is as set out in your appendix two isn't it? No sir. Erm it's it's erm a further alternative erm in that the attempt has been made to to fall in more closely with the county council's wording erm and yet introduce a more positive tone. Thank you. We've got we've got a note of it anyway yes. Er but you'd better let the panel secretary have it. Certainly. Mr Clayton. Er David Clayton English Nature. Erm I'd just like to say we broadly support the E two policy. Erm it is outlined in my statement we do have concerns about the wording er of the first part and the second part of the policy, particularly of the emphasis on amenity and landscape. Now I know in the original draft nature conservation interest was mentioned and er I'd like to hear from North Yorkshire why that factor is taken out of the policy. Er we have suggested an alternative wording erm which is in my statement I won't go on to now. I do feel that the E two policy does reflect P P G seven particularly section one ten and two one where it does mention wild life interest or nature conservation interest. Just picking up on Professor Lock's point earlier on about changes in the nineteen eighties or since the nineteen eighties, erm as in my statement I have suggested that there has been a substantial loss of nature conservation interest and wild life habitats both in this county and throughout the country. And that really is the reason I think for one of the reasons for P P G seven being brought out. Erm that's for that reason I think there is a need to address these sort of er approaches in the the new structure plan policy and er I would dispute very much Professor Lock's statement on them being being no changes since the nineteen eighties. Erm we we have actually got data to prove that actually as well in our phase one surveys er so it's not just as a general statement. Thank you. Thank you. Mr Donson. Thank you. Roy Donson House Builders' Federation. Erm we were asked by Miss Whittaker to erm respond to her suggestion of an alternative wording. My general position would be that if this policy is to go ahead the more it's worded in the positive rather than the negative the better. And indeed I would remind the panel that we still have in P P G one that the basis of appli applications for development should be allowed having regard to development plan and all material considerations unless proposed development would cause demonstrable harm to interests of acknowledged importance. And it seems to me that in order that that ought to be reflected in any revised wording of the of the policy that the development should be permitted unless it would could demonstrable harm. Mr Earle. Thank you Chairman. Patrick Earle Richmondshire. Erm I'd like to refer to my page three or er section four in my conclusions because I think if I if I heard Professor Lock correctly I think he and I are at one in in a suggestion which is is put to you in in if you like without prejudice to the generality of what I have been saying in support of the council's policy. I I do suggest that if you feel that some easing is required that er you could specifically refer to exceptions that will be set out er in local plans. Now Professor Lock referred to allocations and I think that's probably and the front of his mind er having regard to his own comments, but I I would put it more widely as just erm exceptions which could be either individual allocations or indeed erm policies of of a local plan. Because in Richmondshire for example we erm find it helpful to encourage er barn conversion in circumstances which some of our colleague er councils er do not feel sympathetic. Er but that's er as I see it the role of the local plan in relation to policy such as E two. I would also actually suggest that again if you wanted to ease it a bit I'd pick up a point also made just now er in that P P G refers to building and the E two refers to development. Er development of course being a wider category of activity than building. And so I think you you may feel that there's a bit of room for manoeuvre by bringing out the reference to re-use of existing buildings. Erm I I think in fairness to the county council and and er you know referring to the restrictive nature of their E two memorandum is perhaps a little unfair. I I one's always got to er balance that against for example Policy I eight which refers to small scale industrial development appropriate normally permitted in rural settlements. Now that may not go quite as far as as as would would favour. But it certainly is giving that that degree of balance which er which I think we need to recognize. And finally er as I as I make the point in my in my written statement, there are going to be exceptions, exceptions are part of the the game. Erm and certainly when it comes to local needs housing that is in that is explicitly to be an exception and and erm I I see no particular problem with that. And either section fifty four A applies or it doesn't. I mean it if it applies then the local development plan has to be followed unless material considerations indicate otherwise and among the material considerations explicitly by Government policy is the existence of a local needs housing requirement. And so I see no particular problem about the E two in relation to local needs housing policy. But I mean the the panel is going to have to explore this apparent conflict which I don't think's been properly papered over between what is in paragraph five of P P G one and section fifty four A. Er it's a nice dilemma which we're we're faced the planning profession as a whole is faced with erm and and I think that either it's section fifty four A or it's paragraph five of P P, P P G one. I know that's not the received wisdom of the profession at the moment but that's the way I see it at the moment. Mr Williamson. Thank you Chairman. Ken Williamson North Yorkshire. Really just to come back I think there were one or two sort of questions which were posed by various people which er probably we need to to respond to. Erm if I could go back to to what Mr Broughton was saying. Erm I would just like to stress that er again that the structure plan needs to be read as a whole and that there are in fact erm several of the policies in the plan which are certainly encouraging of development, certain forms of development in the countryside. Erm I think that would apply to er some of the existing tourist policies erm certainly and some of the recreation policies. However, I think it it to re-stress again it remains the county council's view in the context of the advice in P P G seven that most most development erm which is going to serve to promote diversification in rural areas should in fact be directed to and located within and adjacent to existing settlements rural settlements which is where, as I said before most people actually do live and it maintains a close relationship between the jobs provided and the residence of people, and that that level of allocation appropriate level of allocation is in fact something for the local er planning authorities to decide through their development plans and to make adequate provision for it. As far as Mr Collier's point er alternative policies concerned, I think listening to it and only half having perhaps digested the full implication, I think really as a matter of principle we're not un unsympathetic to a lot of what what a lot of people are suggesting there. However, I think we do still have some certainly some reservations about erm the policy and how it perhaps fudges some of the loca locational provisions of existing policies. Er and I would highlight again erm Policy I eight which which Mr Earle referred to and also perhaps er Policy I three. On Mr Clayton's point er I think my answer quite simply is that the the the interest of nature conservation are in the county council's view adequately covered by what Policy E six says. Just one point on perhaps on what Mr Donson was saying about the need for polity statement. I it it still seems to me every time I read the policy that it's a lot more flexible than most people are giving it credit for frankly . It doesn't er really sort of er er in a sense prevent er or mitigate against a lot of a lot of developments in the countryside. Is that it? Provided they need to be there. Professor Lock. There there are three of us er, that is Mr Allenby Mr Heselton and me looking for an answer to a question which was about Yes. how, so you haven't missed it, E two and how it would be imposed or not imposed on er as a constraint on local plan making. Would it inhibit local authorities in their local plans Yes thank well yes er thank you very much as you say several pages back . Well the short answer is it to my mind it doesn't impose any restraint at all. I mean it's it's their responsibility to er prepare the local plan in the context of what the structure plan strategy as a whole is saying and I think it's it's necessary not to just look at this particular policy in total isolation and assume that that is going to give er what you fear to district councils the ability to to nothing. They they are obliged to take the structure plans strategy and proposals on board and to interpret them in the in the local plan in the round. But we heard yesterday Mr Williamson about a dispute and I can't remember which district council it was with, it may have been Harrogate, between the county and the district councils on one allocation in the local plan. Does this policy not in effect strengthen the county's arms in, arm in such disputes? Could I ask Mr Potter, Mr Potter's familiar particularly with this I think it was Richmondshire wasn't it? I can't remember. Yes. Yes it was. David Potter North Yorkshire County Council. Er yes I raised an example without referring to a specific site and the site is in Richmondshire where the county council has objected to a proposal in erm what is a a local plan in its very formative stages and the proposal conflicts with Policy I five in so far as I five directs development to the main towns and urban areas. And I believe quite properly directs development to those locations. Erm the proposal I'm referring to is in the view of the county council in the open countryside. In so far as this policy is concerned I think is all it does is give greater clarity to what is the strategy of the plan and what is perhaps implicit within those other policies. I don't think it adds any greater restrictions to the existing policies. I think when you look at the the policies collectively and the policies individually the strategy of protecting the open countryside is implicit within those policies. I think that all that this policy does is make that more explicit, it gives it greater clarity. Doesn't it give you two policies rather than one to batter Mr Earle with, or his colleague? In so far as yes two policies would be referred to, yes. But the one I think just adds to the other, it just makes it clearer. Thank you. Mr Heselton. Thank you Chairman. Terry Heselton Selby District. I I suppose in the in the light of what's been said I I am slightly uneasy erm particularly going back to the erm I five discussion that that we had yesterday and you you'll be aware that part of our objection to the erm the policy put forward by the county council re related to the specific wording of the of the policy and the the flexibility available to local authorities in in terms of allocating land erm that best serves the needs of potential developers and investors. And I think we did draw attention to the fact that er there may well in some instances be a conflict in terms of what Selby district wants and what current P P G advice suggests. But then when you refer back to the original restraint imposed by the erm existing policy. So yeah I'm sli slightly concerned in that respect. I thought you might be with that answer yes. Mr Earle. Thank you Chairman. Erm the the particular case of Richmondshire having been referred to I I felt I ought to point that er we're quite content with the concept of Policy E two as giving the strategic weight to the question of protecting the open countryside and the balance, the very difficult balance, decisions that we and other authorities are going to have to come to in preparing our local plan. We're quite content that we're going to have to er put before the local plan system the the countervailing issues and the weight that's given to the countryside through E two is appropriate in the circumstances. Thank you. Any comment. Ah Mr Feist. Thank you Chairman. Michael Feist Countryside Commission. A lot of the dis discussion has clearly been erm trying to resolve some of the ambiguities in P P G seven er and I think perhaps different perception to what sort of countryside in North Yorkshire we are trying to safeguard through through policies. Er on one side there seems to be a feeling that there should be no development and it would compromise the character of open countryside. And on the other there seems to be a view that, well, erm wherever necessary perhaps on a farm or elsewhere that development should be should be permitted. And the consequences of a latter approach could lead to accumulative change in the appearance and nature and character of the countryside so that you get something rather different than most people's perception of a countryside being there for its own sake. And I think that whereas erm we would not necessarily argue with a case for providing criteria at a strategic plan at a structure plan level erm to put some flesh on what is meant and maybe clarify some of the explanatory memorandum in a more positive way, simply should ensure that the policy does not dilute, sorry that whatever changes emerge, does not dilute the mode intention of the policy. And that the district should be given some form of a guide that enables them to be er to apply the particular circumstances to their own district. There may be some districts that have er areas of countryside which are outside the non- designated areas which they regard as particularly important as erm the gentleman from Selby has said, er and the we have suggested that er there might be a criteria in the policy that allows the quality of the countryside affected by development to be a consideration. In other words, erm that er special landscape areas countryside is not to change quite radically. If there is a decision at the structure plan level that the countryside should be enabled to change quite radically in North Yorkshire that would be a different matter. But nothing I've heard today Chairman suggests that is the case. Thank you. Mr Williamson is there anything you want to come back on or you feel you've had enough in terms of summing up on matters A and B? Yes I was proposing we close for lunch. Reconvene at two and then go straight into matter C which is the next section. Yes thank you er thank you Chairman. Erm I think probably yes the debate has been probably as extensive as it needs to be. Erm I'm not sure whether there's an abiding need to to actually bring it all back together again in in the context of a summary. I think the the county council's made its position fairly clear, hopefully particularly clear. I don't think er my only comment would be that having heard all the comments that have been made and listened to them and tried to dissect them and understand them, I don't think they really alter er fundamentally our position. Thank you. So we'll reconvene at two. Were you dying to say something Mr Rudd? Julian Rudd Ryedale District Council. About time I put an opinion I think. Erm just three perspectives from a district level on on matters that have been raised. First of all erm Ryedale District isn't saying that the policy is warranted because North Yorkshire is in any unusual regardless of the quality of the countryside here, but that this is a reasonable reflection of national policy on development in the open countryside. Secondly, that I think Ryedale was under the impression that Policy E two wouldn't affect local authorities' choice of allocated sites but that it was a policy to apply outside of developing units and those sites we wish to allocate in local plan and not that was going to restrict our choice, in our case in those sites. And thirdly, with regard to Mr Donson's concern erm I don't feel that the policy precludes the provision of low cost housing on exception sites, er certainly hope it doesn't. Erm however, if it could be made clear perhaps with an extra paragraph in the explanatory memorandum that I would welcome that. Thank you. Succinctly put. Can we come back at two and go straight into matter C, major exceptions. eighty nine, I mean nine ninety one. I'm ninety one, And and I'm born the last day in April. And whereabouts were you born? On Street. And er, could you tell me a little bit about your family? What did your father do for a living? Me father was a showman. And how did he come to be that? He went to er College, and he used to wear a mortar board, cos that's the tassel hanging down, and this here thing. And me mother, she lived at , that's not far from Peterborough, and she er Me father used to go to this here farm, me mother lived, and of course they got in with each other, then they got married and then they wanted to buy a caravan. He wanted to be a gypsy, what they used to called them, then. And er on the road. He used to go to Goose Fair, and all the fairs, whatever they was, but it was only for three days. Did you do a lot of travelling around the country ? Oh , miles,mil Never stop anywhere, only three days, so we got no time for anything. So what about your schooling, then? Schooling? Well to tell you the truth, I went to own school, when it was er winter, when it comes the winter, they bate somewhere for the winter, do you see? And I went there for a little bit, and then we moved on, moved off from there, do you see? And er when I did go to school, er all the bottom of er Mill there used to be all sand banks, and me and the other girl, we we came from this school, to look at this here man with a bear, a big bear. He'd got a pole, with a bear dancing round it. And I know the little tune, what he danced to,tiddly-om-pom-pom, tiddly-om-pom-pom,,tiddly-om-pom-pom might go and get a loan put it in the bloody garage and forget it ain't he? Yeah it's er I take the car back half term, if, you know, I don't mind driving it down there, but the thing is how am I gonna get back if I drive it down, it's gonna cost me forty pound fifty Well wait until he's gonna come one weekend and you go down there and then come back together, oh why then again you're wasting your bloody, ha He's going away next week Is he? Oh dear that's why he's selling it, he's going away for seven why? Why not sell it? No, but said it oh and then our dad lent you that three thousand when you moved in he didn't lend me three thousand quid, he cut it off the will It don't matter to me, I'm not bothered, it's just, it's just me and you should have this, look, it's his money, I'm not bothered, I've not well you know if I, I said is it gonna cause any problems when he did it, cos it was er, it was er, to me Not with you No not with you No, but it was a loan to me and I said to my dad he was loaning it me and I said to him erm I pay you back and then when I went to pick the cheque up er he says er well me mum says he giving you that you know he says what we're gonna do is when, when they write the will out you'll get that much less than the others, I says well as long as it ain't gonna cause any problems Not with me I'm sure it's not you know and he says no I, I reckon I had a word with our Margaret she said no it don't matter, but if that's gonna be the case I'd rather give it to him back, I mean I've got it Mm she she says it should be you three, me three and well I don't believe that, well and I'll give it to him back then Oh don't say anything I've got the money in the bank, I might as well not after all give it to him not after all this time, he's probably calmed down now, but er if, if our mum and dad give me anything she takes the hump, but mum and dad can give Margaret anything and it does not bother me Funny, a bit like that I couldn't, I couldn't care less honestly Well she always used to say, why you don't say anything, but she always used to say to, she'd never come down to the house, I mean I don't think she's been to my house, house five times She don't it does my house, in fact it come the other day when Kerry had to pick a battery up and I walked out the front with Kerry and he sat in the car and didn't even look at me Yeah yet when you go round to the house he's sociable enough She bought me at my didn't come in, I cannot be doing with that I don't think she's been five times to my house in all the time I've lived there, now in the early days er she said that when it, hang on, she said she'd never come down cos she didn't like er Mm I thought well that's fair comment cos there's people's houses I'd stay away from cos I don't like the wives, so I mean, you know, that's, I don't go round, but the thing is she's been gone about what three year now, four year or something or however long it is why don't she come now? Perhaps our Marg she's just that way oh it don't bloody matter to me A apart from that she can stay away she can come, come round apart from that she can take her choice that would upset me mum and dad, I don't want, they're too old to be upset What? you know perhaps she's mellowed now, I mean the last time she went on with it, about it, was probably over a year ago, but she's still going on about it definitely a year ago not just What to mum and dad or to you? er she's on, I think she said something earlier, well she told me she said something to mum and dad earlier on But she hadn't? I don't know if she'd not Liar but she said I want, no, Keith had three thousand we ought to have it and erm, I said it's mum and dad's money it's got nothing to do with you, you've got kids, we've had that money and erm, you know, they spend it on the six of them pocket money for sixteen years it all of them have left school now Yeah that's just how Margaret, she's just that way, it used to hurt me at one time, but I, I don't hurt easily You know roughly I'm, I'm, I'm myself so much, that erm nothing bothers me, everything just rides straight across me back I used to, there's one of the women I work with used is a shout and she used to upset me and mm Not that she saw me teased, but even now I can give her back you know Mm and I don't stand any nonsense from anybody, but erm Mm as far as me mum and dad are concerned I'm, I try and protect them Mm I, just erm, I'm on now this year to have me mum and dad cos she never had them at Christmas and I thought it's not fair, you know, she's the Right me mum and dad'll feel it Yeah oh don't, I reckon it was June who got up there Do you? Yeah, I've never been the same since I was there you know Are you? No, no it's hard I erm I always vowed I'd never let erm, never let anything get to me like that again Mm you know, cos I was in desperation then, but, nobody, I mean I just, I just don't bother, I don't let things bother me it's as simple as that It's not good building no that's right, yeah, I mean, I, I've said it, I don't care, but er I've said in the past that er, I think some of the reason me and Ann split up was, I mean she always used to say I never treated her right and all things like that, I did you know, and I do care for her, but a lot of the things was I never showed it because erm if anything bothered me I never know it showed and it didn't bloody bother me because I'd resolved myself after Julie that I'd never let anything bother me again Mm well you have to put your defences down, but not all women are like that Oh I know they're not like them two, erm No, well I've meet quite a few since and they're alright, they come and they go, but, I don't know That Ann probably be alright now, but that's how she should ever so yeah Used to let them at me mum leave er my kids that she made of hers, yet she, me mum never treated them all the same if that, if anybody would see that it'd be somebody in neutral position, like me, and as far as I'm concerned treat them all the same Mm, mm and they treat us all the same an'all but she's, she's terrible, she's got a good point you see you got to let them stop, but it's just, she's got an extremely jealous nature Yeah and, er I always say that I am so grateful I am not, because I've seen what it's done and our Marg with Val her sister, we've both got sisters who are extremely jealous you've seen them, you've seen jealously eat away at them Yeah and I say that I am so grateful that Yeah that I'm not jealous yet and both of them Yeah I'm the same have got more than me Yeah well that's it I know I've got a detached house and Marg's got a semi, but Marg lives in much more erm Con financial comfort appreciate their lives that Yeah you know we've erm, we've chosen to have the erm Material side property Yeah Well not really material just got better taste than me Why is she what's better about her house than yours? Well it always looks beautiful anyway Well that's only cos, why is it? So you think Yeah, but so is this Fucking all secondhand ah, but the only bloody reason it's secondhand is cos it's the, that's the style you want Mm that's why I'm happy with this style it's the style you want Yeah I'm happy with it you can't get new stuff, you can't go out and get something new like that, to that quality Mm, I'm happy with it Mm not I well I'm on about doing some stuff I am cos I can't get, can't find what I want, build my own yeah We've had, we've had the video repaired and up to date, one hour's work Yeah no, no parts thirty quid You're joking I'm gonna ring up to that tomorrow Is it got service actually it was thirty five but five of it was one hour, thirty pounds and I took it to them You took it to them? Yeah Wonder if they've charged ya for er Well we charge fifty pound an hour you know Oh do you? Is service I don't know er well probably gone to the best place maybe it's right Well that's right, yes Well Terry said it was because, we took this, we took that, we took, taken a place on Pranting Street and it still don't work Yeah, it yeah, so we said next time we have anything we'll take it to across the So what was wrong with it then? The cassette kept getting stuck It's only the belt usually It says on wind it up Wind it up have they? re-line cam gear and flat gears on cassette housing, red, idol and cleaned up I think the speed up Such delicate things Oh they are, much you can't bloody see what's happening can you? Oh it's a no I say thirty, we've had that either eight or nine years I can't re I can't remember which, that's cost us thirty five quid in eight or nine years Can't grumble No I said if we had a maintenance on it, maintenance was thirty odd quid a year, over eight years it would of cost us two hundred and forty pound Oh yeah these maintenance contracts are the lowest, I mean I took one out on my mum's C D player because they'd, they'd had trouble with it, er multi play, turns out it was the stack one they had trouble with not that one, but it was only thirty quid for four years I mean Well that Yeah, well I bought, I got the C D cheap enough, you know when I bought them that mini unit, that went just after a year, that bloody thing when it packed up, do you remember it was playing in night, in the middle of the night and my dad got up and said what pratt's playing music, it's his own ha That was lightning weren't it then? Well I do it probably was actually but it was the switch that had gone, maybe lightning had hopped across the switch, yeah, but erm, that's all it was it was the switch, but er, I mean the thing is it went wrong and they had to pay for it, okay it's only a tenner to have it done, but it, if a C D player, I mean if the carriage goes, you know, sixty, seventy quid, you know I'm buying these electrical things, it's, because it's a burg lock, I can buy them, get them a warranty with it an'all, then it's took the burden off them. My dad's pleased with the compact disc, erm, my dad appreciates a good sound don't he? Yeah Really pleased appreciates a good sound and puts that bloody crap on, ha What's he put on? Oh I don't know that stuff with, er I dunno, Acker Bilke or Mm When I first got it in the I was a bit, well it don't sound too hard, bit down hard, but then again they were in a rush, I said there's your present and I gave it to them, and they unwrapped it and me mum says oh come on we'll be late for the club, cos they were getting free drinks at the pub, oh she, she didn't even want to look at it, I said oh, and she looked at it To see and er me dad says ooh it's a video recorder and he, I says no it isn't, he says it is, it's a video recorder, I says it isn't dad, I said Christ I bloody bought it I says have another look, he says what is it? I said it's a compact disc player, mum says oh that's nice, she says what do they do? And I said, I said pour us a tea, oh she says we'll be late for the pub, I thought oh sodding hell Yeah so I says alright put it down She don't think and as you get, you get older they get worse Mm erm, don't, they just don't think cos our kids you know they'll have money erm, say they had money and bought them presents Mm and I think the lads they used to get them some chocolates or something, she says oh more chocolates I've got loads of them I know I bought Do you know it's and it what not since she's been owed They, they still remember that Oh aye and they, that was when they were kids and they still remember it It's not cos she's it, cos she's like that you know I bought her summat, when ours were not, not very old, I didn't know what to get her and I bought her an ornament, she says oh I wish people'd stop buying me ornaments I've got too many, has to dust round them I thought you'll get sod all next year I've had that, yeah and that you'll get bugger all yeah, I think our Julie bought her some talc, she said everybody's bought me talc and that, and our Julie said this year she don't know what to get grandma cos whatever I get her she says she don't want it She moans about it I know and that's, that's just it really she don't think does she? No, she bloody ought to after the first couple of dozen times, but anyway, when they come back and we got back at night and we started playing them and putting things on er you know they got to like it Yeah, that's it, my dad said it's a lovely, well it is That's right I wish I could get another one, it, I can't get one of them Oh same, the same as that, cos the idea was get two the same and I've got one contract, ha Mm I've thought guaran two machines you're guaranteed for four years then, cos they didn't write the serial number down, so if I got two machines and it goes faulty I just send it back and say this machine's faulty, they don't know how many I've got Mm. Morning young man Morning How are you? Alright, have you got it? how long? Five minutes Yeah, we've been to oh you've found it You say sometimes it comes on on line three? Line three, yeah no, not on this one So you've got yeah goes onto there Aha yeah The first thing to do is change the erm change the cos that, well I tell you what I think the first thing to do is do a system reset if that doesn't change the display decoder I think if that, yeah, if that don't work escalate it, because it's a loan problem, you've done everything you can then What about C P U? Change the C P U? Bloody hell, mm, well I'd escalate it because it's a known problem, they might come, turn back and say change the C P U. Well you know what you can do They're not they're not gonna do anything about it They're gonna ask if you've changed it Yeah they will yeah, well you can have a word with them first, you've got to have a word with them before you escalate any way Yeah but I, I think that's the erm but I mean that's the answer I, shouldn't I, that decoder's got to er It's got to be told something before it does it yeah Yeah , you'll, you'll hear that actually come in, if you disconnect one of those legs, if you disconnect that blue wire on there and then cease the intercom and put it back down again you know the relay clicking you'll hear it come in and go back out again, there you go So the twenty four volts is here permanent Oh yeah yeah yeah I say reset the system, do a system reset and then see how it goes, it's all, it, it er it's the main problem them, and there's no cure for it. We've spent months of shelving and then in the end he just says oh sod it, just took it out for an eight one six then. There is one other cure What's that take the bell off? What can you, I don't know if you ever, ever came across any of these er the mark two that want an extension and I think it would project a producing stuff Mm and it was er Oh acoustics Yeah, that would cure the bastard, cos it would only ring when this rang It would also ring if you pull a page out. What was it an amplifier with a speak on it? It's a little acoustic er coupler type What does it do sense a sound and then ring Yeah ring a bell or does it actually pour out of a speaker what comes out of a speaker? No it rings a bell Does it? Yeah So if I call a paging call out and a paging call comes out it's gonna ring the bloody bell Not necessarily I don't particularly want to get involved in anything like that Yeah but I tell you what you know the mark two, have you ever displayed a coder and it rings, rings the bell when the intercom rings, rings the bell if the trunk's designed to ring and all that, you know when you get the, you put a call on hold and it comes back and it goes brr, brr, brr, the bell starts going ding, ding, ding, a right noise and apparently that's standard in the system I think that was a bit of an oversight to be honest with you So the, it's not worth changing the data and the Not data to the no I mean change the data to the phone No I tell you it's wasting my time it's a known problem Say is there something on the data well whenever I've had this Clear this rubbish up Well you know the one at erm the environmental Mm the erm the displayed decoded it's actually mounted next to the kit and all we'll do is take twenty four volts out, volts out, they'll take the, take the data off the kit itself and then just bring twenty four volts out Yeah you know, maybe cos the signal's stronger now I don't know, but that's the way to do it there, well you've got to bring twenty four volts out anyway Oh yeah I'll get you can take it here or you can take it there, it's just that the, the displayed decoder is safer Mm, but what I can't weigh up is there's nothing wrong together in the first place found the twenty four volts Where is that? Across there through that gap The very, the very strays are where the wire goes, if you look at the drawing there a bit er, it actually comes in and out you know, one, one of them is actually the same, it actually just comes in and loops in and goes out again and you may find that you're actually on the same potential there, could be low potential and difference between the two that's all you need Something there there there it's them two, it looks like it could be them, with them round together Yeah, that's right So weird Oh very weird, yeah, I preferred I mean there must be some more, how many more lines are there, look, hang on then Well there you are end of the bloody wires are causing that then is there? Why? They say Say, say that is the bell Yeah mm and they're your data mm they're not paralleled off Oh they're not paralleled off It's a weird way of doing things, it's extremely, it's, it's weird, if you look at the drawing I don't even need to look at the drawing for this it's only six well to have to see take the bloody thing off Oh shut up moaning we've got, aha I'm going down to er Wellingborough in the next Wellingborough? Why what you gonna say? Your going to Wellingborough that's a bloody turn up for the books isn't it? I upset George the other day Why? He says well I, we were on about sort of and he says bring it up at the next meeting, I says I says what meeting's that? He says, the next regional meeting it's being held in Neesden he says you can go to that one can't ya? I says no I can't, he says it's not very far, I said it's not the distance that bothers me it's the fact that you want us to sit there till eleven o'clock at night and not get paid for it, he says yeah but if you want to say something, I says I'd say something if I thought we'd be backed on it, but we're not, oh I'm not going anywhere to be if I'm not being paid I'm not getting involved I didn't know Dick was er Bob, moving, er Dick 's is it? Yeah, cos he covers Derby, he lives in Calverton, he comes through Nottingham to get to Derby, I live in Nottingham and I just do Nottingham, I'm nearer to Derby than what he is, near as door bell, I think it's the way they've laid it out though Well they're trying to send it is they're trying to send me on on that what? well why don't you go? That's not on my patch like It's my patch, suit me here Well I did make do what company here never heard of it yeah well it did didn't it when the weather's like that There we are if you're gonna do that, I'll tell ya if you switch it off and switch it back on again if, if it's the problem I think it is it'll cure it, if it's which I don't think it is, it's the other one that's incurable Incurable It's incurable the reason I say it's incurable the system's too Eh? The reason I say it's, it's, the system's too old to go back to the Japs and say get this sorted out, rewrite the software because they're just gonna say not likely we haven't made it for ten years, or whatever seven or eight years or whatever it is, it's out of date, they're not gonna start working on the system that's that old all they'll want to do is to sell you a new one Yeah that's what we'll do are they overhead them cables? They're not are the oh they are, the end there bloody hell no I don't think it's in there, it's just description stuff, sizes and what have you maybe on the right section there, it's the one where you might wire the L J Us up as well, that's section, ah I think it is, that's it the one with the M B F to what's that? Station socket Right box extension belt there it is next page there you go hear that mate, it just goes in there look, and that, oh hang on a minute no it don't that goes to the bell, through the bell, back out again and then er Come out through the bell, back through the bell on to there and back to there That's right through this big that's right, so you'll probably only just seeing Yeah circuitry there and then there's your, your data which you, you do parallel off Yeah like a yellow and that just says ring, ring, ring that brings the lane and it just does that, that's that belt, all it's doing is taking it through them relay contacts Yeah mm I see which is why you don't see a voltage at the same leg really Yeah fucking weird though innit why it should suddenly start pulling like that That's the way they are, have, have you any extension, extensions put in? Tell you what it could be, ah hang on a minute, I ordered an extension for a bloody for a phone for that office, it could be the phone that's doing it in that office there I know, I know it could be corrupting, you know on the mark one the big one, the old generation mark one It's been going on for months Has it? Two or three months Oh two or three months Yeah, but it's got worse and worse Oh right, yeah and he said it's got worse since he got the new switchboard operator, which makes you think She's probably putting calls, she ain't cos we've tried it over there, you pressed intercom, put it down, it, it does that Shouldn't do that should it? No, I tell ya, there's about four in the company started doing it altogether, oh this is about the fourth one I think why that's what third told me I was talking to Brian day before yesterday, second line, he says there's loads of them doing it and it can't be cured Well all we can do then is reset innit? Yeah, let's do a system reset and you sure you put everything back together that end first Very careful, we'll do that when we get over there, ha Let me get me glasses it looks more like the Selby's one than the erm, than the environmental Oh, I mean cos the main environmental was er, it did it on its own, with a completely empty switchboard, no calls on five o'clock at night, everybody had gone home and the bloody thing would just sit ringing, ringing, ringing, ringing and erm I know this is only when the switchboard's busy Yeah, well you know this, this Selby's one that was the same, when the switchboard was busy it would er, if you, if you sees line three and played it down, well if anybody sees line three and played it down it used to do that or if you sees the intercom that did it, says it's more like the Selby's one than the new one Well I and that was incurable well that was only there If you see line three on You got the key? You've got it I ain't got the key I ain't got the key you had it You put it in your pocket I didn't you've got it Right then, what you got there for? better tell them first You tell them can we just switch the phones off for a couple of minutes, no, no calls on are they? Cheers, okay Dave give it a good thirty second bet you've got a screwdriver over there ain't ya? Got to put this one back together while we're waiting Oh What you got after this then, d'ya know? Dunno mm That one of Selby's you know it was fine until they put an extension in just er a key station as soon as they did that this one started acting up, so he said it's only since we did that, he said it happened the day after we put that in, I said okay, disconnected it, still did it, disconnected it at the, end here, still did it, erased it from the program so it didn't even know it existed, still did it yeah, I, er wait for the light to come back up have you connected it? Yeah, even connected it on the end here, the, the station and set this display decoder up and it even did it there so it was nothing to do with the live lamp wire, the way they routed it we thought that perhaps rerouted it to the cable or something like that Yeah nothing went round and unplugged every phone out, wedged every one out cos we thought it might of been a station that's going down, cos er I'm saying about the mark one, the old two sixty, if you've got a bad phone it used to drag the paging down for all others, where if you've got paint in the socket Yeah or a bit of mould in one of the sockets it used to click all the phones when anybody made a call and er, all, all sorts of things that, I would of thought ah there's a faulty phone somewhere and it's degenerating and er we went round and waste every single one out, every single one, went to this extension pressed line three, play it down and the phone rang, I thought right it's not a phone, I changed the cabinet, I changed all the cards and the cards in one big one, I had one three so it weren't interacting between the two, everything had changed and it still did it, were a new kit, got a cabinet of setting line, changed it and it still did it. Well it st I mean it's something stupid innit? Because the simple reason I even went in at seven in the morning when they've got no compressors going in case it was the compressors dragging the whatsit down because to me it's, it's something like that everything, it's gotta be the C P U innit? It's gotta be something telling that bell to ring That's right and you would think if you change every bloody thing out That's right whenever it was telling it to ring That's right to stop Yeah, well I got a kit there and I wir I wired, just put it on the floor and it light on the wall, had it all connected bang, bang, pull them erm, er wired them all up and still did it, that mine? Or yours? Yours Is it? Yours Yours Call one please ring Brian before ten thirty, it's ten twenty nine now so, oh bloody car phone It's like Selby must be decoder number right round here No find it next to the unit, next to the That's what I like you co , you depend on someone helping me out and Don't out on you Well I, I wonder if it does occur again, happen again Yeah do decode it it's hell of a run you know innit? I did that at Selby's, I had the decoder, the new cabinet, everything, I had the decoder there hanging on the floor like that, I wired it up and I pressed extension sixteen and away it went, it said four there and the display decoder was there about ten extensions And it was about ten, sixteen that was doing it I think it was sixteen yeah, fifteen or sixteen, I'm sure it was sixteen Aye you said, like you say it could be se but third lines that is something that'd happened all of a sudden, of about four throughout the cou , well three at the time throughout the country have suddenly gone like it within about a month or so of each other , and they've never had any trouble before, but I was talking to Brian and he said that's a load of cobblers, he says it's been doing it for a long time and there's loads of them doing it. Unless we and see what's been used Yeah well if, if I get called backed to it, or I'll change that display decoder first, I mean that's been reset now, forget that, er Aye yeah, well if you can get out o, f of that though You can Can you, what on eight three one? Oh dear I mean I figured it's gotta be something date, dated I feel Oh aye, yes cause it to do it Well I thought that, but er you know, that was my to do it, but then again that was in it all the time, you know, it just don't make sense funny how they're both garages weren't it? Mm in fact, eh I tell you what Over head all, yeah they're not, round the corner, all three garages is this is Selby's and there's erm, Selby's is Volkswagen repairer and er, oh no, yeah Lee invite it was in their garage where the lorry was. Of all the systems we've got three garages it's happened to, radio station I think that wants putting back together there Eh? If you want to ring Brian Cancel that will clear it up Put this one back together I thought you'd on we'll do a reset and see how it goes, and just leave it if it, if it clears it erm that's fine And if not I think the next thing actually is to move the decoder or change the decoder Change it, wow, bloody step That's three times you try to fall that, if you have an industrial injury Three steps to heaven that's what it is, kill myself next time Somebody said did you see the accident, no I ask did I have my eyes shut when I kicked him, er Free line now Yeah I just clear it er I don't like the idea of doing that actually Why? What using it for er without asking, it comes up on the er have er, I'll ask her first hello it's the G P G engineer love, yeah, er my pager's just gone off, is it okay to use my telephone just to answer it please? It is okay is it? Alright, thank you, ta O'Connors again O'Connors? Yeah Where's that? Yeah What's happened there? I haven't been there for over a, a year or more I think last time I was there On a tray there's service Is there? I had to put the phone down because of you Oh I do apologize profusely, profoundly whatever it is, no, no I was there when you bought it I know, I've gotta get a frame You've got a get another a picture, it's crap That's not a bad picture that Yeah, it's two-toned as well, it's green and blue Blue and green or is it just I can prove it's green and green because it's a quester two tone exterior with a so that roof's supposed to be green then and that on the top of the boiler is definitely not blue, even though they use blue ink for it That's definitely green cos it's got green on it right Brill news What? got a disco on March twenty eighth yeah it's not that I don't wanna do it, it's Not the people that book with you Yeah Yeah it's relatives Yeah and you feel obliged to them to have it for next to nothing I feel obliged to do it er for more No No, I've been saying they booked me about two months ago and I've been saying that they have a deposit mm Well tonight Mm one of the lads at work come up says there's a disco on March twenty eight and before I said I'm already booked, I said yeah, he says er how much do you charge, I told him and I says well if you let me have confirmation as soon as you can and a deposit of ten or fifteen pounds as soon as you can Yeah as soon as you know for definite That rides over the, the relatives it overrides them Yeah I'm gonna pass them on to one of the other bods at work Why does somebody else at work do a disco? One of the girls at work, her brother does them, er so it's got me out of it Yeah never get out of it Well I don't want to keep a date open for no reason at all and I mean say That's it, yeah the general yeah, if you tell them to say you don't want it you've had it ain't ya? Yeah You know our Wayne don't ya? We're back on line Testing right that one.. I've got excuse me I tell you what I like them, them Two boxes of chicken Yeah I know, a terrible oversight there, I've got erm you know them chicken nuggets that I get, have you seen them? Them cheapo ones from Wallis? Or they might be turkey ones, I go to Kwiksave you get thirty in a bag for about well just erm for a couple of quid I think, or you get twenty four in a bag, oh I don't know, you get something like that anyway yeah I think I'm gonna have to start eating some stuffing I thought the erm, I should, I should get it so erm tell you what I was in a bath this morning yeah You know what I mean Yeah no you didn't you said you were gonna leave it Oh yeah, that was it, yeah, yeah, muttered it under my breath as I walked out, yeah, I'll have to get in touch with that to say if got that erm yeah, yeah I say that amplifier was absolutely useless ha He says need another wire Who says a what, a chap at work? Yeah Well we can get an extension lead, mind you it's alright you it's not the same is it? You may find that's a moulded plug and it, no that end trigger, is it a variable speed trigger? No Oh I was gonna say I bought a variable speed trigger for mine cos its back up it erm But sometimes when you're using it it don't quite work Yeah, mine, like that Ha, see what he means it's a switch Is it? told him it might need a new switch Yeah, well that's why a switch, a switch on mine, so oh no the cable didn't come I says to him be prepared for a bill said I don't mind paying for one, but My last one was eight pound summat but mine's a variable speed reversible and all that About four quid there's no slow start on the reverse I got it while I was working in Leicestershire so I couldn't really take it back it'll cost me more in petrol mm what, I didn't, did you call special on Sunday? Why? Well Les says er when we got out the car and you went he says bloody hell that uses some juice don't it? I said well he reckons it does, he says when he filled up at the garage it were full, he says we hadn't got back and it was between the half and three quarters, I said oh I never looked at it Yeah Is it really that thirsty? Does about twenty, twenty three to the gallon What on a motor like that, no surely not must Right do more at the speed I was doing it keeps it to that, if I'd of kept it to fifty it would of been a lot more You what, well come on we were only doing fifty on the way back Yeah, weren't on the way there though I know seventy minimum on the way there Do you think it's worth it though for what you get out of it, well I mean you obviously do, you like the car don't you? I like it, er pulls the looks, it don't pull the birds but it yeah, yeah, soon I'll call you logo he went running yeah what is it? A bit of a funnel saucepan? oh you're deep frying them are you? Deep frying is a lot actually is a lot better than shallow frying Mm cos it seals the food as soon as you put it in Does it? Yeah So you don't get so much fat in it, yeah I'll have to get a deep fat frying pan then, for all the fat Oh it's true for all the fried foods I'm not no that's what I mean yeah, I've, I mean I ain't got for all the u fatty foods I eat I fry pasta, deep fat one, deep pan, oh I don't know, you know what I mean yeah switch that's gone, it's proving it cos it's a bastard Well you, if it's intermittent an'all put This the toggle fish on to use for a week if it cures the no I'll get a longer lead as well for it Mm about five metres of wire, is that long enough? What powers the drill? is it? Oh I, I had one of them oh would blow off wouldn't it? What is it? yeah, it's says low on it oh number, three thousand and under, one point eight amp, four hundred watts Yeah expect it to be that thick then Yeah,thing is getting them wires out Oh screws from under the side Fuck off What, what you on about? Oh brilliant Don't you know how to do them? Mine, mine was mine was erm if you've got screw contacts on it, mine have well to say that these er these switches are so unreliable you'd expect it to be erm these be a bit user friendly, cor blimey, just cut it about all things down and put a chocolate strip in, plenty of room in the handle Oh really You really want that one off though don't ya? Did he say he wants a as well? Yeah It's a bit of a pain int it? Seven or eight years Oh I tried it for her That's alright then er, I'll put a new switch on and wire, it ain't the wire at all it's the switch Mm have to double that, cos when you wiggle the wires here what it is when you wiggling the wire you're moving the thing contact, I said if you wiggle the wire it's alright it's sort of coincidental Mm it might actually just be breaking the wire there Maybe, just remake it I can't get them out, you can see it's struggling Usually is the wire Not on them it isn't, it's usually the switch Eh? It's usually the switch What on these? Yeah I dunno I think my jig saw went, that was the wire, I just cut it off and made it off again and it was alright it's short enough so it don't go through the window when you throw it Break the window to get the bloody wires through it's what? Where to get the ideas for the lamps and that Just what it is, it's these modern new they're not that bloody brilliant Mm, I can still remember Ann's face now, oh this bloody thing, got it and threw it, no, no Yes it just stopped short of the window, well no it was quite short you know, you could just see it aiming for the window, luckily it was plugged in It stopped it dead it stopped it dead in its track, yeah, couldn't get to rewire it after it though it snapped it a little bit. Yeah, just rewire it up, just try it for er, you know, I mean it failed straight away, if it don't fail within half an hour then your er you know what it is, save yourself getting a switch. Yeah, scrub the switch up that'll do for a change, paint it black inside the hose thing. cos if it's not the wiring, the switch is alright won't be able to what? Won't be able to get the why? a brand new blade, if working on something and working away not minding my own business Mm working away Yeah Oh did I laugh me just about done with these Oh and I thought there were a couple of speakers Oh, don't know where they're from no not really, not proper stand over here no I'm gonna turn the fan on, oh Jesus Christ mm and it always has the same thing Yeah must be want what they swallowed it and they're swimming round Oh shit Zoom, zoom, zoom What time is it? Half past seven, what d'ya reckon then do ya? have you teletext? Yeah Oh I don't know how you work that Just press a button go on and says you wouldn't mind my telly just happened to mention in the night says I'd like a white telly you know, go a bit more with, with the decor a cream, yeah, a cream telly you know, oh I'll have that one he says when you sell it, oh Christ almighty, I thought I was, excuse me perhaps I, I would like a teletext one, just get, you know I don't want, I'm not sort I don't like the colour, I'd rather see a white one in the corner Mm get a white telly with teletext, you know I suppose I could put that one in the bedroom yeah, yeah oh dear eh? Oh that's sunken there innit, yeah don't think there's yet an empty seat They've got people standing on top an'all Yeah look at that right down to the water line though innit? Yeah Them on the bottom they're bound to get their feet wet aren't they? Mm These countries are amazing aren't they, they're so in the cities and yet Mm out in the wild Mm, oh, aye look at that oh can you imagine waking up to that, well probably wake up blind Yeah tossed over a few times in the night, burnt me eyes out yeah, yeah I'd like to visit somewhere like that you know Do what? I dunno, as you say to see the culture things like that but it's a bit difficult to put niggers down in their own country well what's that then, is that, is that just the ferry between an island or something Look for this boat it doesn't even stop, blimey Amazing int it you get something like that and it'll go forever Mm Blimey is that the a bit wicked innit? Did you hear that?

I thought he owns them all No don't own that one at Top Shop Don't he? No Oh I thought he did, are you sure? I reckon he does you know But when you go go into this one yeah they're nice and friendly aren't they? Yeah You walk in and just like er, they're always talking to you And he won't let them talk to the customers? At that one at the Big Shops, the guy that ru okay it might be the guy that runs it not the one that owns it Yeah I'm sure owns it won't let them talk Yeah he won't let them talk, it's disgusting, I tell ya, you know, no end of times I've been in there and it's obvious we're waiting for chips Yeah to cook and they won't say Anyone who don't want chips Something like that Yeah on top of as well, we've just put them in they'll be about five minutes or whatever Yeah I mean what does it cost, no, no end of times I've just Yeah walked out with it's unreal Do you know the bloke , do bloke, do you know the bloke who owns it then? Have you seen him? No, it's, when I was talking to these Yeah this other chappie Yeah you know the top one out the two Yeah, you don't know if he's Greek then? He's some foreigner thing, but they were saying they don't allow them to talk to the customers that's it, you don't talk false stop, no hows, whys or whatever, you don't talk Tell him cobblers Yeah I don't go though I won't, I wo I won't erm I won't go in the shop even with where there's ignorance I've even considered reporting it to the health people Why is it bad? It can be Can it? Oh he don't look very pleased with something does he? Want to nail him to the fence you should think he's not yeah, yeah he had them all panicking Their captain's making it difficult for them on the blower Yeah Did you see that?he nearly shot himself in the butt that time didn't he? He's in a rush to get somewhere ain't he? Yeah he's had a big is that what it is? Oh it's a definite to the side, oh that's his canoe there Oh I don't know why he just doesn't turn the boat so the current was too much for the it is innit? Yeah yeah did you not know that? I learnt something about it in the past yeah You know when you're fishing Yeah boil ham Yeah throw it down as ground bait Yeah sends the fish high Does it? Yeah oh I've heard of them, yeah, but I know this Pre-boil it Yeah rinse the stuff out, and just throw it in and you're away Oh I wonder if you grind it up and smoke it in a pipe with tobacco, would it have the same effect? I don't know I bet it would eh? I used to use them when I was fishing Yeah didn't boil it though did you? Mm, mm can't remember, I di didn't go for long yeah, we was talking about them today actually as a mat as a as a coincidence we er, we own that creepy crawlies and dragonflies Oh it didn't look like it was making a hundred miles an hour anyway No What happens if that engine blows up? Yeah, well it goes downstream then don't it? Goes back to the fisherman and they just er done the dirty on Yeah got one job all day today, oh yeah Got a good day then? Good day, yeah well I was in Beeston all morning preparing it, there's a programme on well I used er technical supports, workshop, went in there grab my and dashed out and fitted it, complete waste of bloody time mind you cos er we've got the own software back in now, well actually the latest releases of it, we were going back a release because er we were having trouble, but it turns out it's not our problem external problem so, put three dot seven back in. I can see it, blimey where's that from? Did it? What for? What really? Yeah You could use that couldn't you? You, you, you have two don't you for a sub base or just, you just have one do ya? One yeah Cos it's not, it's non-directional ain't it base? What, what it is on that one you've got this speaker right and it goes down to really low frequencies especially right, oh gonna add the . Write it out because it's all good practice for for you actually. At er writing out notes as well. So you can do exercise three. Not that one for now because that's doing something different. Now which are the ones that you've got to to group? So far over here. Right. Page page eight starts exercise six. In fact do all of those. Do A through to F. And that's grouping notes plus the bar lines. The later ones are always quite hard. And they've given you they've actually given you, not in this one, but they do give you the clefs here. They've given you the clefs. Did we look at those before? Alto clefs and tenor clefs? Er don't think so. Have you come across those before? come across these. You've come across the treble and the bass right? and the bass, not these alto or whatever. Erm if just take just think of singers at the moment. Soprano is the highest, then an alto Soprano, then an alto , tenor, bass tenor and bass. Soprano is the highest voice. Then comes the alto. Then the tenor and then the bass at the . Oh right. So is So that's that's alto. So is that one up from It's one down from the treble. Think of it as being the next lot down if you like. Then there would be a tenor clef and then a bass clef. The only reason that, that you're using a different clef is that it's actually putting middle C in a different place. On the stave. So that for example an alto doesn't need so many notes, high notes, but needs a few more lower notes. So if you just kept your treble clef you'd have a lot of lines possibly that you weren't using at all. And having to add a lot of low ledger line notes. That saves doing that. Because they position middle C. Middle C's actually positioned between those bits there so the middle line there becomes middle C. Which means that you're unlikely to have to have quite so many ledger line notes. Although this has got one or two. But not as many as you would have if you were using the treble clef because you'd probably end up with a lot of lower this is wha , that isn't a particularly good example really because it hasn't given a lot of lower notes but normally you'd expect to see more notes down on these lines. Soprano wouldn't go down that far. A soprano would only go down to about erm oh about what? Middle C is probably a bit too low for, for most sopranos. But an alto would go a lot lower, would go down probably to an F or a G. So that these notes would be low. If that's middle C you can te what would the bottom line actually be? Bottom line? That's C Er it would It's here. er G. C A F, you're right, yes. Erm so that in fact a true alto would be using most of the notes there. And just a few ledger lines above. Unlikely to be using whereas if they were using the treble clef for most of the time F G. Yes. And then the other one, the tenor clef. Have they given you a tenor clef? No. They'll give you a tenor clef a little bit further on. They may not actually put the tenor clef in till grade grade five now I come to think about that. But there's no point in Not learning it about it now because it's just as easy really. Tenor clef looks exactly the same but middle C is now there. Next line up in fact. So because a tenor sings a little bit lower you've got more of the lower notes and fewer of the higher notes before you need to add start adding ledger line notes. Sometimes of course you'll, they'll still need ledger line notes up there. And perhaps one down there but not very likely. So it's just to make it much more comfortable to look at. Just means you have to get used to thinking, right if that's if, if that's er er a tenor clef then that note won't be it would be, be an A in a bass clef and F in a treble clef. What will it be for that clef? In this erm oh Going downwards going backwards is, is more difficult isn't it? Yeah. Much easier working upwards from C. That line's C. So that line C. would be? C A F D Er C A E You go one below it. Oh yeah. You know F is next in fact C yes. That's A, that's F, that would be D so it's between the two which, which is an E. And if you were going above of course, that note would be? E. E and remember that it's the E just above middle C. And that's the E Does the middle C always come up on a line? Well it's yes it does in fact. Mm. I hadn't actually thought of that before. But yes it does seem to. I suppose theoret theoretically you could actually move middle C to wherever you wanted to have it. But generally speaking they us they use just the four clefs. Now certain instruments use the alto clef. Just a minute. Hello. Oh hello. Alright. Right I'll fetch him, I'll fetch him. Yes he's here. Oh somewhere he is. He's jus just upstai he's just upstairs so I shan't be a moment I'll go and call him . Gosh she's going to have fun with this tape. Go on out you go. Right Yes. So middle C then can be almost anywhere. Yeah. What instrument do you know about do you think that uses something other than the treble clef and a bass clef? Or have you come across the one that Erm instrument that I know. Well that, that you might know. It's not actually a percussion one but it's er in fact I don't, I think most of the percussion ones tend to use a a bass clef don't they? Yeah, yeah. If you see one at all. Yeah or erm xylophones and glocks and those. Except they use treble and bass They use the treble don't they? Yes. Er Bass or whatever. Yeah. Xylophone. Yes, it's a treble. And a vibraphone? Just I've got one of those nice little Yes. It's just like a, a small sort of piano. Doesn't have a very long key keyboard. It doesn't I don't think. Quite an It's a piano and it's odd range. It's very high. Because in fact although it's written from there all the way up to there, erm that is it starts at the C above middle C and goes up Yeah. to very high the unfortunate thing snare drum. I think that's played on the bass what would be on the piano an A. Yes. It, it, they use cert certain lines don't they? They use yeah erm So that you, you get to know what is I think it's er what is what. A is the bass drum. Yeah. er I think it's G they use as the high-hat and there's all sorts of things. Yeah. I don't thing they one thing they don't give in this book is a complete score Yeah. which oh do they? No they don't. No. Which of course I'll ask yeah I've got plenty of those sort Mm. of things anyway. You have to know an awful lot you know for grade five. You, you've gotta have quite a wide knowledge. You, you don't have to, need to know anything in, in depth but you've got to know But you've got to know shallow a wider range. Yes that's right which means in a way that you've got to know quite a lot. There's erm an alto, no, yes an alto clef, isn't it? For trombone, no, it's not, it's for, yes it's for one of the trombones, isn't it? Tuba. Oh I erm found out what that brass instrument we couldn't think of. What was it? Euphonium. Euphon yes. You're erm isn't it silly Mm. I've, I've because you see I could see wh exactly what you were talking about in my mind Mm. but I could not think of its name. Yeah. I got into the car and I was still erm thinking all about this It's, it's, yeah. and my mother said straight away, oh you're thinking of a euphonium. Yeah. That's the one. Yes. It's so silly isn't it when er you know that you knew it all the time. Now then. The one I'm looking for is what, have I got to the strings yet? No I haven't got back to the strings. These just use the bass or the treble clef. And when you get back to the There we are. The strings. It's the viola that we're actually looking for. Sort of bass violin. Sort of bass violin, yes . There we are. That's the one that uses it. So that you see even in a score it would be written like that. So that's the only, only instrument that you generally see, actually see using it in most, most schools. Unless you're going into some of the tenor erm and alto Can I sign those for accuracy, please? I'm taking the silence to be assent. Matters arising on those minutes on page one. On minute one one four, I'm using my privilege as a chair to hang on to that; the fact that the Poly are to hold a conference on health and housing in the new year. I've asked that members be invited to that, I'm sure some of you'd be interested to do that. You may recall that this committee has asked for a health and housing conference but we seem to get under it rather a lot of times, nothing it appears to be happening. Can I have your agreement that we write to the director of housing and ask for his position on it? Will you agree that we do that, rather than have the same thing coming up time after time. Anything else on page one? Also on that, chair, just to clarify the situation, because I know it's a bit vague, we are erm asking the health authority to run the erm meeting with other local authority counties, do you remember? The referral agency's to be in B? Right, lovely. We're doing that. Great, thank you very much indeed for that. On page 2, matters arising. Sheila? One one six, chair. I would like to congratulate the officers for that day. It was a very educational day, but extremely harrowing afternoon, which is still living with me. And I would like to say at this point I was very disappointed that we didn't have any other conservatives with us in the afternoon. Could I suggest probably in future that if we do that we have the harrowing parts in the morning so everybody can see it. Can I say about that little dig at the conservatives, I did actually have No, we were expressing our sorrow, Graham, I assure you Yes, well, I have had a recent case, erm of within the ward that I visited, so I am aware of having the number of problems in the past, I am aware of the problems, but I could not for personal circumstances do the afternoon that day. I understand, Graham I do rather resent it when there are other council committees, there's Town Hall Strategy Working Party in the afternoon, now if we're going to be sure that we can all get to this without conflict with other committees, erm I had to be there on behalf of the Lord Mayor because she had duties, erm and I was very sorry not to be able to come, because I have dealt, visited many occupational, I wanted to visit the officers, and you know, it isn't always possible where you have a conflict of interests. Is it possible perhaps if when we have another day, I take the point that perhaps the morning's but then again we're bound to miss something else, If we can have it a day that is clear of other city councils It may be Could meet before that if we pass on some of your comments at the end of the section, maybe they'll be able to arrange, maybe in two or three months time a visit that most of us can make, particularly those of you who missed it, because it is an important experience, but obviously quite difficult to arrange, because it involves real tenants and real people but we can pass that back, and I'm sure the officers will consider it. Chair, erm on that, if that could be arranged in two or three months time, perhaps we can see how the Charter of Commerce is working out, because I think many of us are very interested to see how it is working out, we could erm discuss with somebody who's in bed-and-breakfast, who could then erm tell us how the Charter of Commerce is working. Very appropriate remark, Michael, the charter is up for review at any event, very shortly, because it was on a six-month trial as it were. So I agree with that, thank you. Page three? Yes, on page three, one twenty, chair, we asked for a date, the date of that conference is the thirteenth and fourteenth of December. That's probably helping Nora. It's not on the minutes, but just to remind you, the thirteenth and fourteenth of December, thanks Tony. Is it to be in the Town Hall? Is it in the Town Hall, Tony? Blessed if I can remember, chair, no. In St Catherine's, Vice Chair suggests. Page four? On page five, those of you who were at the last council meeting will know that the City Centre Management Working Party were charged with the responsibility of looking at the whole issue of street trading. They have now done that and they will be making a report, I hope, fairly shortly, either to us or or both. On item four on page five, you'll see that we said ‘relevant papers to be sent to all members of council’. Pragmatically, I suggested to the officers that a summary of those papers be sent to all members of council in the interests of saving paper, and that if you see something you want to know more about, you then go and talk to David Turner, is that agreeable? Otherwise you will be inundated with paper. Item one two four, Highways and Traffic do not agree with us on touting. And I'm sure we shall sit quietly over that. Page six, Matters Arising, page seven, yes? I was just going to ask if we have a diary? Tony? Not at this stage, chair, next committee you should have. Thank you. Okay? Can we use item one two nine on the minutes, first of all to say that some of us were at the H I V awareness training session last week, with Robin, we enjoyed it enormously, she's hiding behind the thing. Looking for the right word! So we want to say ‘thank you very much’ to Robin, and also, this is our opportunity to learn officially that Robin is leaving our employment, I think in February? Yes. And it's an opportunity for her and me to say a couple of words to us, and for us certainly to thank her very much for her service. I just wanted to let you know that in February, won't be hiding behind an OHP, erm I'll be taking up a post with the European Commission, working with Aids services throughout Europe. erm I'm very sad to be leaving Oxford, I've very much enjoyed working here, and it's been good to work for a council with such a high commitment to H I V, and to fighting Aids, and erm I very much the support I've had from the committee and I hope it will continue erm in this way. So thank you very much. I'm sure Health committee's commitment to the post will continue. And I'm sure I speak on behalf of you all when I say thank you very much indeed to Robin, you've done an excellent job, and we shall miss you. Thanks. Can I chair just draw your attention to one or two items. I hope this committee will, since everybody else is doing it, yet again, my absolute, the officers and the management on Northway Community Centre It's on the agenda Betty, you'll have another bite at this cherry. Oh is it? Yes Oh, sorry, right. Anything else on page seven? Most items are on the agenda, actually. On page eight, item one three two, can I draw committee's attention to, says she, feverishly flicking through the pieces of paper, to a letter that John Patten has written to us, you'll see what we asked Amanda to do on our behalf, Amanda Root, Women's Sub also asked her to do that, and John Patten, surprisingly enough has written back, his private secretary has written back, she continues to say, ‘Mr Patten is used to getting communications from Chief Officers conveying the views of committees, he has never had any correspondence from Sub-Committees through other officers’. Now, I wonder whether the opposition members might not like to take that up with their M P. I think an MP is there to respond to correspondence, and I'm very surprised that he takes issue with one of our officers because she doesn't happen to be the Chief Officer, and I'm very sad about that. Can I just ask, I'm not usually a member of this committee as you know. So you might be out-of-order in speaking, in fact. Can I say that sub-committees, as I understand it, report to main committees? Yes they do. So, in fact, had that decision gone to the main committee, or is it going, is it coming here now. This was a decision of main committee, on page eight. I understood it in fact from what you said that it was a decision of the sub-committee. Women's sub also happened to say the same thing. Yes, Mavis? Sorry, if I could just clarify, I was actually at the meeting of Women's Sub, erm as was Robin in fact, and they, the Women's Sub-Committee considered the minute of this committee, and endorsed erm, in fact, Amanda didn't write until the meeting of women's sub, because it was being considered by them, but erm they didn't add anything substantial to what was this committee had said and they did. I just think it is, in fact, a great shame that the MP only acknowledges some letters if they happen to have the kind of status that he appreciates. I don't think there's a defence for that. Betty? Well, he seems to have been conspicuous by has absence in respect to these things. He has been invited to talk to other committees in the past and has decided not to do so. Now, I don't take very kindly to that. Whatever he thinks of the political make-up of this council, he owes a duty to the city and to his council. And I think this is a an another example of how little he seems to care for this city. Well, on the specific issue, which is item one three two, are we agreed that we write quite clear but nonetheless firm letter to Mr Patten, explaining that we are minded to ask him to comment on these matters, it this time comes from the Chair and the Chief Officer about and perhaps he will therefore take it more seriously. Are we agreed that we do that? Graham? I was just going to say that I'm sure he it's not that he didn't take it seriously. It may well be he felt that there wasn't necessarily the full authority of the city council and administration sub committee. Now clearly, he responds every day to individuals of the public. Here, I can only think that he was saying, ‘well, we don't know that there's the full authority of the city council in this view’, but erm I'm not going to put up a defence, I just think that what we do is basically stress from yourself and from the chief officer that we do want this file known. Could I have a copy of the letter, please, can I take it up? You certainly can, Anne, thank you. Other matters arising on page eight, you'll see on item one three four that we did investigate the possibility, did we, have we got a response on that, of an officer being part of the joint care planning team. I wonder if the county have responded to that, yet? We haven't had a response. We haven't got a response, fine, okay. Item eight, any more Matters Arising? Item, erm sorry, page nine, on the Food Safety Act, we did write, the Chief did write, to Andrew Smith, to ask about the position on the Food Safety Act, as far as monies go, and I will read you the response, it was a question in parliament. ‘The Government has estimated that local authorities in England will need to spend twenty four point seven million pounds in ninety-one, ninety-two to carry out the additional duties resulting from the Food Safety Act. This additional cost is being taken into account in a total of aggregate external finance. The post to be twenty-six point oh five billion which will be distributed to Local Authorities on the basis of standard spending assessments. My Right Honourable Friend will be announcing our imposing Standard Spending Assessments in the near future.’ The implications for us are that we shall have to find it very hard to ensure that we get a share of that grant to spend on implementation of the Food Safety Act. I would suggest that the government would be a lot, lot better adding a ticket to amounts of money, which said ‘You either spend this money on implementing the Food Safety Act, or you don't get it.’ Future Labour Government's committed itself to doing that, and I would suggest that the Secretary of State should do it, because we're not guaranteed to receive that money at all. erm Anything else on page nine? erm On Nestlé, Chief's reminded me that we have got, I received today, a long letter from Nestlé, basically saying they won't be coming today. I shall make that letter available to the solicitor who we have asked to check out with Estates, and with other authorities regarding the way forward, if we wish to make any public statements about our dealings with Nestlé. I'm not putting it around the table, because it's a very long letter, and I don't think we could have a worthwhile discussion on it right now. Yes, chair,actually gave it to this headed copy of it to consolidate erm with regard to contacting Leicester and Leeds Councils that have also sort of taken action against Nestlé, that's still being done. The officer at Leicester's not available at the moment, so he hopes by the next meeting erm if Leeds have an opportunity to see that letter, and perhaps have a short report on what this council does with respect to Nestle/1 and also what other councils have done. Michael? Yes, erm, going back to the original thing that brought this up, that we should descry people from using Nestlé's products, erm, in fact implications will be quite wide, because they now own Rowntrees, and they own Cross and Blackwells, and they own all sorts of other companies. Now, is it the intention of the people who asked us to take this action that we should just boycott Nestles products, or we should do the whole range of the conglomerate that owns all these people like Rowntrees and Cross and Blackwell, and many other companies as well. Because this, erm, I think it's quite far-reaching to erm get all hot on this, and I don't think we realised the full implications. Yes, the implications are very heavy, I had not realised what you'd just said, and we should refer that to Amanda and indeed take all take it on board, otherwise we'll be taking on the world. Yes, probably should. And probably should, yes. Item one four oh, believe it or not, Doctor Root did write to Mr Patten on this issue, and guess what he wrote back? ‘I've received a letter from your Health Promotion erm Liaison Officer, can I ask you if this was sent on your behalf?’ ‘On which committee meeting was the letter considered?’, he doesn't trust anybody, this guy, does he? I propose the same action again. He's obviously keen on structures and procedure is the Right Honourable Gentleman Must be a past experience! Yes. Well, he's taking a lot longer and costing us a lot more money in terms of letting us know his view. Actually, to comply with the minute, it should go to the City Environmental Chief Officer. Yes. Well, as you know, we always say the City Environmental Health Officer, and the officer responsible then does the work, we've seen to that on our committee for years If you look at a department like the Director and Engineers department, every letter in fact has underneath it the City Engineer, even if its signed by somebody else. I mean it is a possibility, and if he's going to be awkward perhaps we'll have to just make sure that we do that, which is presumably fairly easy, if the post goes out from the same office. I take your point Anne, but I would prefer to help the MP understand that the nature of the way that this department is run is that officers do take responsibility for their specialist areas of work, the senior management has always supported that, and I don't feel minded to change it because the MP finds it difficult. Well, I certainly will take it up if I get a copy letter, I mean it is obviously that some departments act differently, and I understand that in any case this is only a letter from the secretary, it's not him, so I mean, I'm quite happy to take it up if I get the copy of that, and explain that this department act, does rather differently from some of the others. And we shall certainly do that as well. Chair, the letters that do go, the majority of the letters that go to MPs and members are signed by me, though they're prepared by the officer who's the expert in different fields, but these two letters went when I happened to be away from the department, and that's fair enough, I'd rather they went than sat around waiting for my return. But, they also go on headed note paper which says Oxford City Council Environmental Health Department and all the other stuff we put on the top, erm and it's perfectly clear that they do come from the City Department upon your behalf. He's being awfully bumptious, let's be honest. Chair, can I just help you here recently, because we've had a recent case ourselves erm, this is an ironic twist to this, because Councillor Patten's being writing to the County on Highway and Traffic issues recently and sending us a copy, and it's stunned us a little bit, because normally they would write to us direct, but there's a sting in this because we don't know whether we're supposed to respond to him now, or the county. And the county don't send us copy letters, so, chair it does need sorting out as far as we're concerned as well. It really does doesn't it. I can see the Press headline: ‘MP with knickers in twist’Anything else on page ten. Okay, apologies for absence and substitution. Chair, I have none, I'm afraid. May I say that Mrs Kurtz, I would have thought has sent her apologies, and I'm substituting for her Sorry, I should explain to the committee that I was informed that the secretary who normally does the minutes for the half past one was sick, and had, she'd been sent home by her doctor at lunch time, so I came back from lunch and had to come straight into committee, and I do apologize if I have missed bits of paper or whatever, I've gathered up everything I could, but that might well be one of the things that I've left behind. We accept that Councillor Kurtz would be honourable in these matters, do we accept Councillor Tiffany as her substitute. Yes They're not saying a lot are they? I had erm I was going to be representative of this committee at a erm safety seminar for three days at the beginning of this week that I wasn't able to go to, and Councillor Kurtz has very kindly gone in my place, which is why she is not able to come to this meeting. Ah, well in that case We do appreciate that explanation. No, I think sometimes it's forgotten not all that many, you know, these remarks about us not being there. There's not many of you! Only three that can be there and We're quite happy that there's not many of you Anne! Okay, so we accept that Councillor Tiffany is now substituting Councillor Kurtz and may now take her full part in the meeting. Can I just ask your permission for our proceedings this afternoon to be tape recorded by Caroline, and I've forgotten where you come from, Caroline? From the University Press, from Oxford University Press. From the Oxford University Press. Will you need to know why she needs to tape record? Thought you might! Yes. Would you like to tell us, Caroline? Yes, it's for the dictionary project, we're doing a, erm we're trying to build up a database at the moment of transcribed spoken language. We're happy to take part in that! Could we have that repeated, please, I didn't hear it. She's of the dictionary project that's looking at transcribed spoken language. Oh, we'll have to be careful, then, won't we! You may have to be careful. Perhaps you ought to tell her that John Patten is no longer with the environmental health. He is in fact. Is he still there? Haven't seen him for about two weeks. So we're all happy about that? Approved duties. You'll probably need help filling round here. I was going to say, I have no idea, unless there's, if they're on the agenda, I'll pick them up and see, if there's anything else, you'll have tell me about it I'm afraid, chair. I'm not immediately aware of anything else, but members, please rack your brains as we go through, Diana? You gave us, you gave us some dates on page three, item one hundred and twenty, thirteenth and fourteenth of December. I believe we've taken a decision on that for the health conference, last time round. I've got one on page eighty-one, but we'll come to it on pollution control. They're are some others too, chair, on the seminars and conferences we've listed. We can do on the way through, okay. I think there is no urgent business. erm Well, as I understand it there is a report on the authorization of officers, which is urgent business. Ah, that's right, sorry Yes, chair, and I don't have copies and, you do? Well, I have some, I thought they'd gone round, but this is, erm sorry Chair, it was one officer whom we've got on staff at the moment Karen Wheeler who's away nursing her new baby, and it's to authorize that officer to carry out certain roles under the health and safety Can you circulate that, the committee is accustomed to seeing it. I don't think it should cause you any problems, but it is something that's come on late erm as a result of maternity cover. Right. Ian Waterhouse is with us, probably wondering how on earth these meetings get off the ground at all. Ian, you're the community services manager. We have a paper from you on, can we settle down a bit. We have a paper from you on page eleven. Can I ask you to limit yourself to some five minutes. I apologize for that, that, but we have a very heavy agenda, and members start falling asleep around five, and if people have questions or comments, perhaps they . Welcome to our committee, and we hope we'll be working together in the future. Thank you, yes, erm thank you very much for inviting me to attend to those meetings and giving me the opportunity to meet you all. Having worked for a number of years now in community health services, previously erm in Yorkshire, in fact I've only been down in Oxford about four or five months, I've learnt how important it is in fact to make good working contacts with members and officers of other organizations, and particularly of local authority organizations. I'm therefore doubly grateful to you for giving me the chance to meet you today, and I hope that some of the contacts I might make today will stand me in good stead in the job that I'm doing in Oxford over the next year or so. I have sent round a briefing paper, and rather than go right through that, what I'd just like to do is to highlight two or three things about myself and about the post that I now hold, and I would be pleased to answer any questions that you might have during the next two or three minutes. Firstly, just to set my own context, I've been in the health service now for just over twenty year. I went into the service in nineteen seventy as a national trainee, and I'm therefore coming from the administrative branch of the service. I'm not a qualified nurse, or a health care professional. I'm an administrator by background, and I think that's interesting, because one of the things that we are trying to do in the health service is to open up our management posts to people of all professions, and to recognise that management is not the prerogative of any particular group, but that we're looking for the right people to manage our services from wherever they might come, and I'm one of three people who has a responsibility to the senior manager in the community at the top, for the managing on a day-to-day basis the health services in Oxfordshire. Of those two colleagues, interestingly enough, one is a health visitor by background, the other is a nurse, but someone who practised or hasn't practised, but as a district health community planner for a number of years. So you can see that we have quite a mixture of people in terms of our backgrounds professionally. The purpose of general management is to try and ensure that in the city that we are getting the best value we can from the health resources that are in the city, and I have the authority now, and the responsibility to spend the budget that I've had allocated from the Oxfordshire Health Authority, by Gerald Simon who's the general manager. So a big change in the way that we are arranged has actually come about through the general management structure, and we're hoping that this will give us more room, if you like to start looking at priorities, and to move the budget around in accordance with our feelings about those priorities. In that task I am assisted by a team of six managers, all of whom are professional nurses and district nurses or health visitors and they of course are there to advise me on professional issues, and to share with me the management task of using the resources of Oxford City in the way that we feel is best appropriate, and in doing that, I think one of the important things for us to do, I don't think we do it quite as well as we should, is to work more closely with the local council, and to look really at what the needs of our local communities are for health, and to try and make sure that the feelings that might well be expressed by individuals, either individually, or through caring associations, or through other statutory agencies, or through voluntary health organisations, are actually given a chance to be there, and to influence our, that official policy and constituents , and to, to influence the planning process. I've made a note of a potting of that briefing paper to you. I personally see this is as one of my major objectives over the next year or so, and in a sense it makes me trebly grateful to be here today, because I hope some of the contacts I might make today will enable me to work alongside you in what might be called even local Berkshire band, and to try and get more a multiplicity of views from different organisations channelled through our own value objectives. And it is the exciting part of my job is to make these links work, start to build on them, and over our links in the city on the environmental and group with Tony Benn , that's that's doing a very good job, he is a platform for this, for each other, but I think there's a lot more we can do locally erm within the city to build those links, and to work together for better answers for the city, and I hope that, on a practical level, one of the things that interested me was your grants team for local organisations, and I would like to think myself here today, we might look at the health authority, and try to join with them to make some erm practical contribution, particularly to those many carers, and groups of people who have problems, and we're not all just professionals best able to put over during our normal nine-to-five or eight-to-eight days, we we can. There's a lot we can do, I think, to help the community in a wider sense, and I see that as one of the key elements of my work, to try and make that work. And I'm not too concerned with the day-to-day management of individual professionals, I've got a team to help me do that. What concerns me is looking at the and trying to forge new creative links with other organisations, statutory and voluntary, in the best health interests of Oxfordshire residents. That I think is my main concern, with a request in a sense to you for supporting that over the next year or so, because I'll be trying to perhaps get invited to the meetings, and perhaps we'll be inviting officers from the authority to join me in looking at ways of building up that local context in planning to get that into our formal planning systems. That will be my key message, and the other thing I'd like to emphasise today, and I'd be very grateful for some sort of early response to that. I have discussed it with Dorothy Tomkin I think we have a genuine desire to move to a more authority-based planning system, erm, we haven't got the methods of doing that yet, and I turn to C B S and to local authority and to the traditional carers for them to join us in that. So thank you for giving me the chance to, to air that view. There are means to get a response and I'm grateful to take the temperature of the water. Right. The temperature of the water will inevitably be variably, and I'm sure we certainly welcome, lots of people will welcome your philosophical position. I would say just two things; the one on the rates scheme, we certainly as a health committee distribute fifteen thousand pounds a year and treat these as important pledge by work. We can't deliberately do not maintain those voluntary groups which we feel are appropriately and better funded by the health authority. The health authority has for years not shown any signs of so doing, I have to say. I don't want to be cynical at this stage, but years of experience that show that the health authority has no intention of doing that. And the other thing to say to from me is yes, we would love a multiplicity of views to go to the District Health Authority, I and my predecessor Betty Stanford, who were District Council Members on that health authority, we were there and able to listen to and able to contribute to the debate, the Government White Paper has taken us off, so that is not a good start in terms of how you involve the city and the district with the policy decisions of the health authority. So that's my bit of bad news. I can see Arthur, Betty and Liz. Chairman, may I first of all declare an interest in this. erm Under the new erm system erm every G P must at some time during the visit erm persons over seventy-five. Now, what are you doing to ensure that erm that this is carried out because a lot of elderly, they will not go to the doctor, but erm the doctor I believe has got to go and see them. Now, what are you doing to really see this is getting off the ground? Well, I Ian, can I ask you to save the questions and respond at the end, otherwise you'll find the discussion takes much longer, is that alright? Although that may not be appropriate view of that, but, Betty? I was going to raise the very question you raised. There we were as representatives of this city, people who are in contact with erm people who have got problems, we were Can you press your button, Betty? in my view thrown off without any reasonable excuse, because I felt that I could bring a lot of expertise to the health authority. They may not have thought of it as expertise, but when people said to me a particular ward is dirty, I went and looked at it, and in a very short time, within about ten minutes, that ward had got a massive clean-up team in there, that's the sort of thing that I felt was useful. That being said, I mean, you've lost now local, local erm expertise there. What I want to ask is, firstly, who are you funded by, and these teams, I note erm paragraphs three erm these nurses and so on, are they existing staff, or is this a new team, erm management team which has been set up at yet more expense to the health authority? So, basically, I want to know are they taken from erm a team which is already in the health service, or are they new posts funded, and funded by whom, bearing in mind the constant complaints we get from the health authority about lack of funds? Thank you, Betty. Liz? Thank you. I'm finding myself somewhat confused, I mean, I was interested that Ian had mentioned the practical voluntary services as one of the groups that he would wish to work with. I think that recently we seem to have had such, so many changes in the health authority, so many different peoples in the post who all seem to be doing the same sort of thing, who've got the Family Health Services Authority set up, but it would seem to me that some of the things that are on this piece of paper are things that I understood were being done by the Family Health Services Authority. We have a joint planning officer, and we've got quite a lot of joint erm of joint planning going on between the voluntary sector and the Health Authority and the Social Services. We've got a whole erm, a whole erm organisation that in fact the Council for Voluntary Service only this week made an appointment with a very, very, very, very small amount of money that's been made available on a very, very part-time basis, to actually assist with that, with the planning that's going on in the voluntary sector. And I think that we're constantly hearing about new people, new systems of working. erm New people who are being put in posts to liaise and to do this, that and the other, with a shrinking voluntary sector. With a voluntary sector that is erm constantly needing small amounts of resource in order to deliver an enormous amount of service to vulnerable people. And I think that the time will come some point, when the voluntary sector will say, ‘Well, we actually don't have time to talk erm to carry on talking about what we're doing and how we're doing it. We actually much prefer to get on with what we're there to do, and to, to offer services, to find, to find ways of supporting vulnerable people. So, I think my questions are, one, where does this post fit in the Family Health Services Authority? Two, how does it fit in with the Joint Planning Officer who's also ready in post?, Three, how will it fit in with all the locality planning and all the work that's already been done in joint planning between the voluntary sector and the local authority and the health authority. Thank you very much, Liz. We'll keep you going all afternoon at this rate, won't we Ian. I've seen Anne and Nonnie and I don't particularly want to see anybody else. I'm glad Liz is confused because as one of her predecessors I'm also confused. I mean, you know, we've lived with this planning. There's always been planning with the people on planning, and it seems to me that the paragraph that begins ‘A key area’, we've got some more planning. And I think really what's needed is actually going out, I mean, it could be a useful new thing that, a new departure that other people haven't done. In other words not sitting there and asking people to, erm people in authority, erm sort of people of influence, ask them what they think, but actually going out and visiting people and groups, and I was going to ask whether this would be copied to the women's sub-committee, because there are many, many groups of women who never have a chance of saying what they really want, and I don't mean patients, I mean potential users of the health service. erm The Health Service has been very much male-orientated. I'm very glad to see that there's quite a lot of nurses here, and I presume that quite a lot of those are women nurses, and I think that this is terribly important, and I think a useful thing with this new service could do is to go out and talk for instance to the meetings of women's organisations, to old peoples' clubs in the afternoon, and actually ask people what they would like, and get them talking in a nice informal way, rather than waiting for somebody to let them know what they think, because I don't think they're going to get it. So, I think that would be a useful thing for a new planning section to do. erm My ears pricked up when Mr Waterhouse did in fact say, I though he said that it wasn't necessarily help in monetary terms, but some of these people might be willing to help in kind, or in sort of helping as people with some voluntary organisations, and I think, if that was what he meant, I think there again that might be very useful, because voluntary organisations are always looking for people to help. So those are my few comments, thank you. Thank you Anne. Nonnie? As someone who has to ask occasionally for a care package for an individual, do I take it then the penultimate paragraph that this is the planning, you know, how you're going to produce a care package for an individual, this is what you refer to in the planning system, and that you're getting together with Social Services to get this care package together? Yes, Okay? Would you like to tackle that lot in the best way you can? Thank you, yes, erm to take the final point in terms of care packages, yes, are officers are working on, Social Services officers, on the professional care assistant care packages. Yes, but at what level? Do you yet know at what level that's going to be organised? I don't know. You don't know, so that's part of the planning system that we're working on? The working groups are currently on working on that, and they, my colleagues I assume are talking to the the officers of the Social Services about that, what is happening, but the final outcome has yet to appear. Just answering the first question on assessment of the over seventy-fives, that in fact really should be better left for the to say. I'm not part of the organisation. They have a responsibility for managing the U G B Contract, and you quite rightly said that one of the arguments on that contract, assessments of the over seventy-fives. I belong to the Community Oxford Health Authority not to the Family Health Services Authority, so that's just to clarify that, that did cover two questions that I was asked. In terms of Primary Health Care teams, they are existing members of staff, or health visitors attached to General Practices, and we call that collaboration if you like . In terms of a planning process Anne was talking about, you'll have to forgive me for being relatively new to Oxfordshire and coming from an area where we had a planning system which was largely the one I was describing, and the planning role that I saw I wanted to develop was very much already mentioned which was actually going round to small groups of people, to the local caring groups on a much more informal basis, and getting their contribution about that and then feeding it back into the system, which you say is there in a sense. I don't think it's rooted firmly enough in the localities. And it's that part of the jigsaw that I want to concentrate on. So if there's anything, there's a slightly different approach to it, and one thing that we are being urged to do, through the very way in which you mentioned in another context, is to make sure that facilities are appropriate locally, and developing policies within that. I don't make any apologies for that, and maybe it is going over the old ground, but unless we do it, unless we try to do it, if we've done it the way before been and it hasn't produced what we, what we want, then surely it's not for us to sit back and say, ‘Well, it's been through that and it hasn't worked’, surely we ought to try again, and that's what I hope to be doing, sort of value your support and see you . Yes, can I say to you that what you're hearing is members' experiences of the past. mhm I'm not sure that you'll be able to uncover dinosaurs as it were. Well, no, but I But of course in terms of partnership, you will have our support and any way we can aid and abet you then we shall do that, erm but you can tell from the questions and comments that we have some distress about the Yes, I get that, yes Ian, thanks ever so much, it's not necessarily been an easy ride for you, but we're glad to know you and we look forward to meeting you again. Yes, well, I hope so, we can sort of work it out. I'm sure of it. Thank you very much indeed. Bye Thanks, bye bye. You can stay of course! Don't blame you! Can I just draw your attention to your item on Urgent Business. Do you all have sight of that? It's headed up ‘Appointments and Authorization of officers’ and you're asked to authorize Stephen Stansfield, a non-professional health technician, as detailed in para. 2, it's a very normal and routine bit of work for you. Are you agreed? Agreed. So that we can get on with this work. Thank you very much indeed. On to item six and seven. You'll remember we do this on an annual basis. It's very efficiently organised for us to do. We've got Keith Dryer here, I think, of the engineers. Keith, would you like to press your button and introduce us to item six, street collections in Oxford. Thanks, Chair. Basically, the latest, and I mustn't take any credit, and there seemed to be some credit, Chair. This lady on my right, Katherine Powell, does all the hard work and committee reports, and I thought it only fair to bring her here today, because she's the person that does the set fifty-threes, She does? She's one of the members you can come to. So Katherine can answer the details on the report. Right. Welcome, Katherine. I didn't realize that's who you are. I'm the one who'll always be late getting a reply back on the set fifty threes! So Katherine, do you want to say anything on the report at this stage? I'd just like to point out that erm on the street collections as you've always done before, AvaRag and NovaSports don't generally get passed, because they don't actually help anybody in Oxford. Right That's the only thing I'd like to bring to your attention. So, you can confirm for us that NovaSports are still in that position, and I think some of us understand the nature of Avarag. Yes, erm they've got a sports centre in Nottingham, and that's the nearest thing they've got to Oxford. Thank you for saying that to us, yes, I wouldn't have actually picked it up. Chair, can I just ask, I mean, so it's organisations that are Oxfordshire rather than Oxford City. Yes. That's tended to be our line. They've not been tested solely on that, but it's on the question. Well, unless people have specific to Katherine, as I say it's presented in such a way, this report, that essentially we're asked to agree the number of permits to match the number of applications. I would suggest to the committee on page sixteen on our recommendations that we do make the point about Avarag and NovaSports, just in terms of consistency, and I would expect you to want to continue to do that. So does that mean we still grant twenty-three Saturday city centre permits? That doesn't alter that position, Katherine? No, Well, it will go down to twenty-one. Quite. Could I ask on page seventeen about Blue Cross? We have got erm some organisations, the ones I can think of is the Animal Sanctuary that we are all familiar with. erm I, does Blue Cross have any connection with Oxfordshire? Yes, they've got a farm in Burford. Ahh. Can I ask that you agree on eight one A to grant them twenty-one Saturday city centre permits, and you're clear that you've left out NovaSports and AvaRag, and you understand why? Graham? I have a great deal of sympathy with all these organisations anyway, and the tremendous number of volunteers that come out on the days. I'm just wondering whether in fact every Saturday that you've got, bearing in mind this is not flag days, this is in the street. Yes, these are street collections. That we really are putting a tremendous number of people on the street over the course of the year, erm that the general public are facing. And while I think we ought to do what we can, I think there's a line which ought to be drawn, and I do honestly wonder whether twenty-one, it was eighteen last year, and I just wonder if perhaps we should erm try and switch some of these to mid-week, so that we're not seeing it virtually every Saturday of the year. Okay, Betty? I just wanted to say to you, firstly I declare an interest in OxRad, not pecuniary, of course, with money, however, but it is on behalf of charities, it is the only way they can generally raise some two three hundred pounds in a day, or sometimes a little more, that is a tremendous help to charities. And I think that erm twenty-one is nothing like too many, in fact that's not even half a year. It doesn't mean that in fact that erm that there are twenty, my maths are right, that does mean that there are thirty one Thirty-one. Where there is not a collection, I think that's perfectly reasonable. Well, of course, there's flag days as well . Yes, well then we're also making provision for disaster funds coming up, emergency funds. Can I say that we are now organising quite tightly the business of street collections, and I think if committee are minded to reduce the number of collections that we allow, we should decide that before we come to this meeting, because I think it's very difficult in practical terms to do it at this stage, and therefore I would suggest that we do agree twenty-one, not withstanding what Graham said, we can take on board some of what he said, and maybe the month before we are asked to take this decision, we have an item on the agenda where we discuss the principle before we get down to the practicalities. Would that suit you for the time being, Graham? I think so, It made me feel that some actually seem to be quite keen to have suburban or mid-week, even though they've had city centre ones in the past. Some clearly want to switch to city centre. But I did think that it might just ease the pressure on Saturdays, because, following what erm Betty has said, in fact, as I make it it's forty-five Saturdays out of fifty-two, and bearing in mind Bank Holiday weekend, Christmas and that sort of thing, it's virtually every Saturday in the city centre there is a collection. Now that's fine, but I know some people who are in the city centre every, on Saturday, feel very guilty if they're not constantly giving, and I do think we want to get that balance. Clearly we want to support the charities, and the organisations but erm. I was just going to make a quick comment if I may on Oxfam, because I noticed that they're down for the street collections and for the flag day, now next year's their fiftieth anniversary, so I think it's quite appropriate next year, but I do, my own view is, that we will get, we ought to get one comprehensive list of all these organisations, for both the street collections and the flag days, with an indication in the column of whether it's flag day they've gone for or a street collection, so that we can identify that sort of situation. Right, I mean, that seems quite sensible actually. I would just like to point out that suburban and mid-week flag day erm street collections alternate with the city centre the following year. That it, try and talk about a square. What would happen? Erm How would you work out? If you d Er just sort of talk it through. Drawing a circle, what would you do? Well you'd er mark off Mhm. every erm ninety degrees. Okay. And draw through the points. You'd draw through the four points. work if you d drew a diagonal Okay. the centre. You know. Erm Be ninety. Ninety, ninety, ninety. And these angles would be? What would the angle Erm here be? Forty five. They'd be forty five . Isosceles yeah. So the interior angle. Would be ninety. Would be ninety. Yeah. And the exterior angle would also be Would be forty five. would also be ninety. Oh yeah it would. Yeah. Right? In a square . I see it. So it would work with a square. Erm would it work with a triangle? Erm three points the centre point. Right. So what would the angle at the centre be? It'd be erm twelve. Hundred and twenty degrees yeah . Hundred and twenty. Okay. Yes but it wou cos if you had the centre point up to the top of these two that'd be hundred and twenty, hundred and twenty, hundred and twenty. so if someone said like Do a a hundred-and-eighty-sided figure Yeah. it it'd just look like a circle. But you could do it. So you're happy with polygons? Okay. So that's one if it comes up again Definitely . No problem on that . Yeah. So you've obviously dropped a few marks on that. Yeah. Erm probably on this and on this one. The big thing there is there's no rule in life that says you know if someone says Five them you must draw five centimetres. Yeah. This might have been five knots, five miles an hour, Yeah. decide well we'll have five inches. Erm it is likely that it's not a linear scale anyway. It's possibly the Beaufort Scale Yeah. which is a sort of logarithmic scale . Yeah. Erm so don't make don't make too many assumptions. carry on with symmetry? Yeah. I got all of er for them more. Okay. So let's let's have a look at the others. Now you tell me which ones you think were an absolute doddle. A giveaway. This was the ones here. Mhm. Measure the size of the angle compass. Okay. Did you Erm protractor sorry. did you use that or No cos I didn't have it at the time when I did that. Would it have been an advantage to use the ? Erm well er yes I thought cos I'm just measuring the Yeah. It depends what you're used to. When you get used Aha. to this one, you'll find it so much easier. Yeah. Erm it's a bit off-putting at the start because it's got the two scales on. Yeah. Make sure you're reading the right one all the time. Okay. So no problem there. You think you got Did you did you see which ones you got full marks on? Erm yeah. I didn't do this I d I didn't quite finish this one cos we only had erm one and a half hour to do the two-hour paper like. Okay. And there were how many marks on that then? Erm erm eleven marks like. Mm. Mm. So at the start of the paper,have a quick whiz through, see where the marks are, Do them first, yeah. and think, Well I'm going to Not necessarily do them first. I mean you can whi you could go through and you can pick up lots of ones and twos that build up. You're probably going to do them anyway, and they're good to get you into it. So you're thinking, Oh this hasn't been an exam, these are dead easy, to just play yourself in. Erm but don't like the Mm. ones the or others, if you're getting stuck on them, don't miss something like this that you could do and get full marks. Yeah. Er you know makes a big difference to your final grade doesn't it? Right. Any problems with these? Erm no. They they they were they were straightforward, just Okay. How did you do this one? Erm I drew a I drew a erm Venn diagram. Right. Put my twenty one in the Whimby circle or Whitby circle, and the thirteen in the erm Scarborough circle. Put X in the middle, and twenty one minus X . Okay. Just just show me how you did that one. So a trip to Whitby and a trip to Scarborough. You've got thirty pupils interested in one or both trips. Right. Twenty one interested . in the Whitby and thirteen interested in the one to Scarborough. So there's an X in the middle. How many interested in both of these trips? Erm Now okay. You've got thirty down there, that's good,X in the middle, twenty one minus X, thirteen minus X . Yeah. Okay. So So when you get to that point you you've more or Yeah. less solved the problem haven't you. If you can if you can handle simple equations, you get the answer. Like most of these, the key Mm. is what should we call X. Once you've Yeah. sorted that out then you follow your system. Okay. And does that does that work out? How many would you have in here then? Yes you'd have erm seventeen. So you've got seventeen in there, seventeen in Whitby. And eleven. Okay. And then erm four interested in the both trips so What does that come to? Erm erm it's twelve. Oh right that's not right is it, no. Erm Mm. Okay so we've got eleven and four is fifteen, and seventeen is thirty two. It says there were thirty pupils. Yeah. Mm. Now did you see your marks on this one? Erm no. I d I didn't er not on that one. No that's okay. So there's another one where probably you can pull up your marks quite easily . Yeah. Cos you know you know the method, you know what to do, it's just a question of sorting it out. You know a little bit of extra thinking about it. So one of the points that sort of comes up is you haven't used the thirty at all have you? Now did they give you that and it's something you don't need or do you think maybe it's something you do need? Er . I just didn't know how to apply it . Mm. Okay. Is this basic idea okay? We've got X pupils interested in both, so we've got twenty one minus X in that and thirteen want to go to Scarborough, okay? Thirteen minus X in there. Now where did this come from? Twenty one minus thirteen equals two X. Well you've got your X there, you've got your two Xs there, so you subtract them and you've got Mm. and then take the halve. Well th you've got an equation, okay. Twenty one minus thirteen equals two X. Now where did it where did it come from? Show me where each term from so you could Thanks very much. Cheers Dad. Put away your er luggage. . Er cheers. Scattered about . Cheers. Right. Okay. Thanks very much. . S erm so I had to subtract these two. Mm. Try and explain it in terms of say let's get all these kids out into the school yard, Yeah. and draw two big circles that intersect, Yeah. and say, Now we want to sort you out, see who's going where, so we can organize the coach now, and if you're interested in Scarborough go and stand in that circle,Whit Whitby there, interested in both then stand where the two circles intersect. Yeah. Okay. Now take it from there. What will you what how can you work out Well erm just count how many's erm I mean two teachers come back and one of them says, Well I've counted all those who are going to Whitby. and the other one says, I've counted all those who are going to Scarborough, Mhm. and er nobody remembered to count the ones in the middle. But we do know there were thirty pupils, which hasn't Has that appeared in your equation anywhere? No not really. No. Now erm I still don't really understand where you got this from. Erm Why did you you do twenty one minus thirteen for a start? Well I had the the twenty one and thirteen in the two groups so subtract those two and have twice the amount of X I thought I would have . Erm you you seem to be equating the groups. Okay. We won't go into where you go that from cos I think it sounds a bit like sort of clutching at straws really. Yeah. I'm going to get an equation out of this. You you've you've started off brilliantly. You've got marked on you know exactly how many are going to Whitby,right, twenty one minus X, how many are going to both, and how many are going to Scarborough. So what could you find out from that? That ties up with this. That ties up with . You could er subtract the number going to Whitby from thirty. You could. Erm You could do something a lot And then simpler. A lot simpler. How many pupils were there altogether? There were thirty pupils so And how many are there standing there in the playground? There's thirty. Right? Right. So an equation? Yeah. Count how many you've got in here. We've got twenty one minus So twenty one minus X plus thirteen minus X is equal to thirty. And those in the middle as well. But oh twenty one minus X plus X plus thirteen minus X is thirty . Right. So we just right that down, that's the total. So we've got twenty one minus X those are the ones going to Whitby, and we've got X going to both, and we've got thirteen minus X, and that's the lot. Now assume that this is assuming they all voted. They all said, Yes we do want to go. Yeah. Erm it would have been better if they'd given you some information to say, They all voted for at least one Yeah. trip, or there were four who went nowhere. Okay. So. Erm What does that give you? So it'd be erm thirty four minus two X plus X erm Okay. Er X So how do you just I mean rather than do it in your head, especially in an exam, just what you're going to do, put the Add X to both sides say. Erm If you add X to minus X . Oh it's three yeah. Right. Let's have a little look. Thirty four equals thirty. Right. If we just take it from there. Thirty four minus X equals thirty. Now as soon as you've got a minus X and you're trying to take it over to one side, and you're trying to bring the other one over, there's a good chance that something's going to go wrong. So why not just follow a nice simple system. Thirty four minus X equals thirty. Okay. Add X to each side. They go out. Subtract thirty from both sides. Thirty four minus thirty equals thirty minus thirty add X. Okay. So X is equal to? Four. Which is what you've got there. And Yeah. Now does it add up? It should do this time if your if Is this right? We've got Let's check that. got the same answer still. Twenty one minus X If I give you some numbers to add up. If I said twenty seven add thirty five add forty nine add seventeen, would you add them up like that? Or might you put them one under another? Yeah I'd probably put the numbers Okay. So which are easier to Yes. fit ea slip easier. Twenty one minus X plus X plus thirteen minus X. Tot those up. Plus X and a minus X go out. That gives minus X. Thirty four equals thirty. Erm there may be a simpler way of doing it. Now is this right? Cos we're still getting X equals four. Add the X to each side,take the thirty off each side we've got X equals four. So what's going wrong here? Seventeen and Ah. Oh sorry nine yeah. Nine yeah. Because that comes to because that comes to nine.. Yeah that's right. And that comes to . that comes to thirty. Okay. So it does come to thirty. Erm the way you were doing it will sometimes give the right answer but the easiest way Yeah. is to make sure every box is marked in there. Let's do a slightly more complicated version. Erm scribble on here. Now let's sort this out. Erm let's see Okay. Let's see if those erm Right. This time Let's take that off. This time there are twenty nine in the class. So you've got twenty nine students in the class and fifteen want to go to Whitby,and eight want to go to Scarborough,and three little piggies want to stay at home. Three of them don't want to go anywhere. Twenty nine in the class so what I'd like to know is erm draw the Venn diagram and find out the numbers of students in every section of the diagram. And then if you can do that you can do any problem of this sort can't you? Yeah I suppose so. three. Right. Okay. So where are you going to start? Yeah but this Right. That doesn't add up to twenty nine, does it? It doesn't add up to twenty nine . Eleven. Erm Twenty six. Twenty six. Okay. Well spotted. I probably mean nineteen or something. Let's have a look. Erm Erm Okay. Seven seven don't want to go anywhere. Right. Seven don't want to go anywhere. Right. Okay. That's great. Erm that's So you've got the various sections of the diagram. You've got the Whitby lot, the Whitby and Scarborough, Scarborough and the don't want to go anywhere. When when you when you add them up just if you just put them under each other, it makes it very easy. So keep the numbers That goes there. that's it keep the numbers under the numbers and the Xs under the Xs. Okay it's twenty nine right. So an X plus er So X equals one. Okay. What will that give us? That's Fourteen and seven is twenty one. Fourteen that was sent to me by the the people who want the stuff. So Oh right yeah. . Okay what does that come to? Er twenty twenty nine Twenty nine. Now you might think, Erm oh a bit finickity saying do it this way, but it's a good system. Erm also when you're when you're adding up if you get this fifteen minus X, right, eight minus X and you're putting You just cross those. the numbers underneath each other and the Xs underneath each other, plus X, and then the plus sign X. well that goes with the numbers. Yeah? Then when you add them up You don't get confused. So I can just Mm. take these two off. Because there are Mm. so many, it's very very easy to do. Yeah. Lots of people'll finish up with, Oh that's a three X and they'll put plus three. Mhm. And this way it's more obvious what's going on. There's going to be a minus X left over there, and then you can add those up. Thirty minus X equals, how many were there, twenty nine. And it more or less does itself. Yeah. So as I said, if I give you a list of numbers, say two- or three- digit numbers Yeah. in a long line,horizontally, you'd think, Oh I'd like to put these vertically Yeah. and do a nice little adding up on it. So why not do it with Xs, because there's more chance of an error. Now why it's a good idea to do it that way So I don't in me head like and mixed up. Again in an exam, there's more chance that you make a little slip, because there's little bit of extra edge. nerves like. A similar one. Erm this time everyone's at Wembley and you're asking people,Right, if you draw this time we draw three big circles in the middle of Wembley,okay,and ask people to come and say which football team they think is a good one. So we've got Liverpool, Everton and Tranmere Rovers. So they say The instructions to the crowd are, If you think Liverpool is a a good football team, stand anywhere in that circle, Everton in that circle, Tranmere Rovers, stand in this one. And we get something like this. Erm and let's say there are a few a few awkward ones here er who don't think any of them Yeah. are a good team. So those who think Liverpool is a good one,standing in in that circle, we've got say twelve thousand. Okay. In the Everton circle we've got say fourteen thousand. And in the Tranmere circle we've got erm twenty thousand say. Okay. And we've got thirty thirty thousand people there altogether. Now so I want to know the sort of the numbers in all the boxes. Now Right. talk about it a bit before you start it. Erm is it similar to the problem you've done? Is it harder? Is it much harder? Well it's just erm it's like doing three of the previous ones isn't it like? Yeah. How are you going to sort that out? Erm well I'll start off labelling these W X Y Z. Right. And er label this. That's . So as you're labelling it, what do you think of the problem? Erm it's er Do you think it's easy or very much harder than the last one or just er pretty difficult eh. No. You're not going to be able to just look at it and write down something equals two X are you . No. You've got to really work out what's what. Right. Okay. So you've labelled your diagram and you this one is that minus W minus Y minus X so on. Erm it's a bit a bit awkward-looking isn't it? Yeah just a bit. Could you have labelled it in a way that would sort of help yourself more? Make it a bit simpler. those three added together, so W plus X plus Y plus plus the er the rest of E equal fourteen thousand. Yeah. Okay. So what's your next step from there? Oh right, I write it down on the paper. So erm Okay. And how many equations are you going to get do you think? Erm . About. About. Okay. All right. Hundreds. About hundreds. Erm No erm Well okay let's look at it another way. How many equations would you l would you like? Mm about one. Just one or two. Erm If I gave you a problem about sort of prices of apples and pears I suppose it no I suppose erm two W plus two three Y plus X plus Z Mm. If I said erm, Ten pears plus six apples costs two pound forty, Yeah. how much does one apple cost? what would you say to that? You can't really do it really. Why not? Cos you've got two unknowns. And? And only one equation. Right. So that give you any ideas about this . You got to have two two equations. Two equations. How many unknowns have we got? Erm. Three four five. No. That the I've got I I know these. You know those. I've got four unknowns there. So you've got four unknowns, so you're going to need Four equations right? Does that sound a bit daunting? Yeah. Well so four simultaneous equations. Mhm. And they won but they won't be difficult cos they're all linear. Yeah. They're all there're no X squareds or W squareds or anything else in. . But you can do them. So with with that, you know how much the total comes to, thirty thousand. Right. So I could put Oh aye yeah, W plus e Y plus X plus E equals fourteen thousand. Mm. And erm . Have you used Say in the first one, Yeah. Er you didn't use that. So can you use can you think of an equation that involves that? The total people. Well tell me tell from your diagram, what's the total? Thirty thousand that are there. Right, but that okay ? Oh just these added up? Okay. So don't forget the one thousand who don't think any of them are a good team, add all those up and that will give you a fourth equation. Yeah. And all you need to do then is to find one of these in terms of the others and substitute in, and it'll come out fairly easily. Now you can choose these erm slightly differently. For example you've got lots of got lots of minuses in. What you could have done say was this one here that's marked E doesn't have to be all of those who supported Everton, it could be just that bit. Yeah. Right. And you can an expression for it then in terms of that. But there's no reason why you stop at three. It could have been twenty five different variables Yeah. there are in real problems. Erm With two it's not too difficult. I mean sometimes you can almost just try an intelligent guess and maybe Yeah. about the third guess you try you get the right answer. With that, there's not much chance . No. Okay. Erm so you need to develop a system that's going to always give you a method and is always making the work easier for you and not getting you lost. Okay. So that's enough I think Mm. on that to sort of show you the power of the system we were just using to erm The obvious thing to do is to label every area of the diagram, and don't forget they do sometimes say, Seven were not interested in Yeah. in anything. Label every area and then use what they give you about the total number. The total was thirty pupils,add all that lot up equals thirty. And when you were doing these with lots of you've got now got W X Y and Z in,when you're adding up if you lay them out like that Right yeah. with the Ws under the Ws it's you'll find that those horrible looking equations will simplify quite nicely cos there'll be a plus W and a minus W. I see yeah. And you'll get things that you know you'll get an equation just in X then . So it'll be erm so fourteen thousand minus W minus Y minus X Mhm. and the next one then twelve thousand minus W Mm. minus Y, then Yeah. miss that gap plus Z That's it. Exactly. And then that one Right, you've got it. two thousand plus Yeah. Y and X and Z. So although it looks like, Ooh this is horrible, four equations four unknowns, I'll be here all night And then it's not cos you're just . I've got You're eliminating one at a time. Yeah. Once you've got that fourth equation in from all this lot adds up to the total, and that's the one that you seem to be forgetting, that's the one you've got to try and remember. Okay? So shouldn't be any problem on those. This one er I wasn't too sure either. Mm looks like geometry to me. Mm yeah yeah. So A B is parallel to D C. Calculate the values of erm write down possible Okay. Erm it's geometry. That's the answer to that, Yeah. basically. It's something that I usually say, Leave till the last. It is a Did you spend much time on that? No I j just had a l er Good. er an attempt and then I thought, No I'm not Good. gonna It's a waste of time . It's it's it's the sort of thing that I would always recommend And there's only about three marks for it anyway so. Exactly. Leave your attempt till the end. So rather than you going well on this nice question, and you could you could have done it and picked up Yeah. another sort of six marks or maybe eight marks for the the end bit of the question, erm you'd spent a bit of time on this. Anything to do with geometry unless you've had a lot of practice and you're very good at it, you can finish up wasting time. Yeah. So I would say, Have a go but leave it till last, when you when you've done everything else and maybe you when you've just checked through to see if the others are okay. So let's have a a little look here. Political party making election promises. Erm was that one alright? Yeah. That wasn't too bad. Eight percent every year. a hundred and seventy five billion. Mhm. Erm put it over a hundred times the eight. Okay. And then you add that onto that. And the next Right. year you get Now. Okay. Erm Mm, yeah that's good. And did you do it that way, you worked out the percentage and added it on? Yeah. Added it on after Right. What's Start off with a hundred pound Yeah. and add twenty percent on. Yeah. What's the final amount ? Hundred and twenty. Okay. Start off with a hundred pounds and add thirty five percent on. So a hundred and thirty five pounds yeah. Okay. Start off with erm two hundred and add thirty five percent on. What's your final answer ? Erm two Two hundred Okay. and seventy. So how are you working it out? It's erm two hundred over a hundred Two hundred and then work out thirty five over a hundred of that, Er work out what that comes to, which is seventy, and then add your two hundred on. Okay. Well if we do something like what we finish up with is thirty five percent of two hundred of two hundred okay, plus a hundred percent isn't it? Yeah. Of two hundred. So what does that come to? A hundred and thirty five percent. Oh I see yeah. Okay. . So if you want to So it's if you when especially as you're going to do it on your calculator anyway, . what would you multiply to get the answer straight off? What would you multiply that two hundred by? One three five and then percentage. One point Three oh three five . three five. Yeah, or a hundred and thirty five percent as you said. Yeah. Erm if you find you've got a calculator without a percentage key, and some of them haven't, especially Yeah. some of the scientific ones, mine's got one. erm you can just do that . . So if I wanted to find out erm Let's do that one with the the N H S, and this time I want to know how much it's going to be It starts off at a hundred pounds. Yeah. A hundred billion. Okay, just call it a hundred. And we increase it by ten perc Well let's say we increase it by It's not out money is it, so let's really spend it and increase it by fifty percent every year. Yeah. What would you multiply that by, that hundred? One point five. Okay. So do that try that on your calculator. So what did you get? hundred and fifty pound. Right. So while that's still in, times one point five again. . Well you've still got your one fifty in, so times one point five. So two hundred and twenty five right. And leaving that in, times one point five. That's three hundred and thirty seven point five. So you can see how they as if they ask you to do it over three years or five years or something You just keep on doing that yeah. you don't you're not doing several operations and putting some in memory and bringing it back and giving yourself lots of chances of making mistakes. No. It's just multiply it by that constant thing each time. And with most with a lot of calculators I mean you Don't try it unless you really know your calculator and know how it works, you can just keep pressing equals, Yeah. and it does the last thing you've done times the Yeah. say do it once and say we want six years, put equals equals equals Yeah. more times. Erm if you're going to use =thing something like that in the exam I mean there's no reason why you shouldn't use that multiplying it by one point whatever the percentage is. Yeah. What would you have multiplied it by if it was erm the eight percent? One point eight. One point Well what would you Oh ze oh zero eight, yeah sorry zero eight . Yeah, okay. That's the only thing to watch, that. Yeah cos that'd be Eigh eighty percent that'd be eighty percent yeah. eighty percent is one point eight but eight percent, okay seven percent one point O seven. That's the only snag with that, that you you can get the wrong But it's very much way of doing it . Yeah. Okay. Solve the equation. That's pretty straightforward that. Expand that. You can do that. Yeah. so much for its call-out fixed charge plus the time. That's okay. Yeah. Yeah? And then working backwards. It costs Yeah. sixty five pound And then just er just changing the subject there like. Right. Now if we put that on there. Erm I dunno this is somebody else's paper so This is before I had a I worked it out as I I th I thought it'd work out a three- four-five triangle. Mm. Did you work out it was a ninety degrees? Erm yeah well I I Why? I realized that cos Why? Cos it looked it? No cos erm the here you've got this in a semicircle, Right. and if it's touching Okay. the top it's always ninety degrees . Did you say that on the paper? Erm I just put a little arrow with ninety degrees in the semicircle . Mm. Cos it looked it. Erm wh what they're looking for in this answer is erm Because it's the angle in the semicircle angle B is ninety degrees. Yeah. And then carry on and do the other bit. Erm you know you can look at that or you can put a protractor on it and Mm. think Well that's ninety, but you need to say that it is ninety because it's the angle in there. Yeah. Okay. Right. So you'd probably get minimum marks for that . three marks for that anyway. Mhm. What did you think of this? I looked at it and I er panicked. Then I looked at it again and I realized that it wasn't too hard. Mm. I mean I got er the only th part erm I did mess up a bit was the the part here. Mm. Cos I got this the wrong way round. But other than that I got the right. Right. Now this this what I'd like you to do,is read it out but only read the absolute bare bones of it. We don't want to hear anything about Janet having trouble with her bike and Janet a powerful young woman or riding the race of her life , or any don't want Yeah. any of that. It's just rubbish. When you when you're reading this through, you're having a quick skim through, you can can you can cross out, you can sort of totally obliterate Yeah. what you don't want to know because it's One of the problems here is there's so much noise. Yeah. There's so much random stuff that you don't just details irrelevant . yeah. You don't want to know that she was wearing odd socks and one of them was green, it's Mhm. nothing to do with drawing the graph of distance against time. So what are the important points in that ? That they set off neck and neck. Okay set off neck and neck. Right. Alright. Then Janet took the lead then overtaken ten seconds later. Mhm. Then built up a lead of fifty metres. Right. And so she behind all the way but caught up with her a few metres Before the end. before the end. Oh just before the finish, fifty metres from the finishing line. And then Janet overtook her just before the finishing line. Right. So all this about the North Rose Trophy and it's just When you see You f you said you felt like panicking. Yeah. You're in middle of an exam, you're trying to do everything very quickly, and there's a great long screed of text Mm. to plough your way through. Erm so get sort of practise reading it so you can cut out the irrelevant stuff. And a good thing as I say is to just erm highlight the stuff that you want if you've Yeah. got a highlighter, or maybe underline it, and maybe even cross out. Yeah. Because you rea you're going to read this about three or four times aren't you? Yeah. before you understand what on earth is going on here. They started off neck and neck. They started off together. Okay. This one goes in the lead and then stops and then the other one goes in the lead and then she puts a spurt on and catches up. You'll read that sort of round and round a few times before you get it straight in your head what's Yeah. going on, and you don't need all this garbage in it as well. So your first time through you can cut some of that stuff out, and then you've got it. You've got the bones of the problem. Then you can work with it. Erm so do you think you got it sorted out roughly? Even I mean you didn't quite get it sorted out in the exam but No. did you think that you know what you've done wrong now, Yeah. and how to do it? Yeah. There's there is often something on distance time graphs and also quite often it's like that. Now I think that's not a maths question. No. No. That's an English question. Yeah. I mean if you I don't know if you know of anyone whose standard of English is quite poor No. but their maths are okay. Mm. Now that's quite an unfair question. Cos if they can't read through a lot of text and sort it out they haven't got much chance . No. They just sit there mesmerized for half an hour and then Right time's up. Okay. So you're alright on trine time train Yeah. train timetables. Mm? You just draw a line of best fit you know line of best fit through erm all the points well Okay. the one that goes nearest the majority of points. One goes nearest the majority of points. Okay. So if you've got a load of points all here Mm. and there's one stray off here, you'd go through that way, the line of best fit. Ignore any strays. Mm. Okay. How about the gradient of the line? That's like the average what is it it's a Distance so it's the average speed that's been travelled throughout the journeys. Mm. Erm the gradient of a line okay, there's a there's a bit of graph paper. Okay X is and there's a line. What's its gradient? Erm the change in the Y Okay it so change in the It it's so measure measure the gradient of that and tell me what it is. I'll make it so they're nice and e even. Now you said you'd make it even. Yeah. What did you mean by that? Oh t I had two point nine by three Mm. by seven point nine. Okay. The one you made nice and easy was the nice and even was the Y. Yeah. Which one are you going to divide by? The Y, so change in Y over change in X so Mm. You're going to divide by the X . Oh yeah, best off doing the Yeah. It doesn't matter cos you can . . Better get rid of that line yeah. Probably pencil . Okay. And what does that come to roughly ? It's about erm two point eight. Right. Two point eight Seven centimetre. So that's erm . . What's what's the units? I don't know it's just whatever the Well what have you done? What did you do? Oh I cha I divided Y over You divided Divided the change in Y So many millimetres Yeah. by another number of millimetres Oh right, oh millimetres that's it yeah . and what's the answer? Erm millimetres . Millimetres divided by millimetres is what ? Yeah it's millimetres square. Millimetres erm the other one. What is it? Erm What's X divided by X? One. Er one X. Just X. Just one. It's just millimetres . No it's just one. It's not millimetres, it's nothing. It's just a number. So that's just millimetres then yeah . It's millimetres divided by milli No, it's not millimetres. No this . The answer is not in millimetres. The answer is just a number. Oh right. It's a ratio of one length to another. Okay? Yeah. Find the ratio of that height to that length. Mm. Okay. And let's say it's a third. Mm. It's not a third of metre, a third of a millimetre or a third of a kilometre, it's just a third, the ratio of that length to that one. Okay? I see. So the ratio of that length to that one is point four. But the gradient the gradient of the hill erm you could express it in terms of an angle couldn't you? Yeah. If I say, Is that hill very steep? Ooh yes, about forty degrees. So if we look at this Twenty five. Twenty five. Find the tan of twenty five degrees. It won't be in centimetres or millimetres, it'll just be a number . Two point four six. Right. Six three . That's a much more accurate way of finding the gradient. . Just find the tan of the angle. You don't have to measure. You've got two measurements here. This two point eight isn't accurate. No. It's what, plus or minus point one almost. Yeah. I mean point one of a millimetre's not much. You could be almost well you could at least plus or minus point O five. Yeah. Right. Which is a big percentage that you're And both of these could be out. One could Yeah. be too big and one could be too small, which would make a big difference. But you can measure the angle pretty accurately on that to s to within say half a degree and have its tan. Right yeah . Erm because there's your angle,there's that, and this is opposite over adjacent. So the gradient it's a ratio it's not no units to it, not metres millimetres or anything else, and it's the tan of the angle. So the gradient gives you a mea If I gave you the gradient, if I said the gradient is one, what would the angle be? Erm How would you find the angle? Just one and then do the tan backwards. Okay tan to the minus one . five. So there's a that's that's what gradient means, the tie-up between them. It's not In some cases like erm the diagram you were doing about the two girls running,erm then the distance against time gradient will give you speed, give you velocity. We've done the Roses,you're okay on the symmetry, you know about that now. Yeah. I mean if if it hadn't got a ,there's noise in the problem there's Yeah. irrelevant stuff. If you if you you strip it down to the Actually I didn't know how to do the arc . I wasn't sure how to do that. Okay. But you know now. Erm That was pretty st that the height of just a bit of It's a bit of algy and a bit of pythagoras Yeah. in together. And the area. What is how about that one? What is the square root of six point four by ten to the ten to the five? Well erm eight hundred but when I did it wrote it into normal terms like six point sixty four with one two three four noughts Mm. and then I square rooted it. Mm. Erm yeah, I square rooted it. Okay. Yeah that's a good way to do it. Mm slightly more easier for you is just multiply it by one of those tens so you've got sixty four by ten to the four. The square root of sixty then take the square root of Eight. The square root of the sixty four is eight, the square root of the ten to the four ten squared. Oh right yeah. Yeah. Erm okay. It's a good way to do it to if you think, Oh I can't really handle this going on here, put all your noughts on and then you can work out what they come to. Okay. Erm weather stations near the north pole. we should start ringing alarms bells a little bit. So what did you do for this one? Right I measured well it's seven kilometres apart so I measured the distance between them. Ah. Mm? Erm in centimetres or millimetres . And it came to five. It wasn't seven centimetres eh ? No so it's And it should have been shouldn't it? fifty millimetres. Right. Okay, so you worked out what the scale was. Yeah. And then what did you do? Erm I so it was for one So seven kilometres is equal to fifty millimetres. Mhm. I did erm Yeah. So you seven work out your scale that comes to So seven over five. And then what did you do for this next bit? It knows it's between four and three kilom kilometres away. Yeah. So er point seven one er is equal to one kilometre. Mhm. So work out the Yeah. So four kilometres so multiply point seven one by four. Yeah. You worked out what that would be and then on the one the scale and then what did you do ? Yeah I worked out what this would be on the scale. that's from T so I dr drew a line a cir a circumference . A circle. Right. So I did round there. Yeah. and a smaller one round there. Right. So you work out . what the scale is so you can set your radius and draw your two circles and say, It's in there somewhere. Yeah. Okay. That should get full marks. Yeah. Bit . Mm. Erm er that trig trigonometry there again. Mhm. And then er just work out the length of this and then the length of that and then subtract these two lengths. So that's quite a nice question. Erm Seven marks on that. Okay. Transformation. You alright on the transformation? Yeah. Yeah. You've been doing those alright haven't you . . Ah. Mm. How many of those can you get out of one of those eh? Erm How many mugs of water to fill the tank? . Okay. So you cal calculate the volume. Yeah. That one's no problem. Yeah. You think, Right I've done that with me fish tank. That one. What did you do for that? Erm I used the equation sheet which he wri wrote on the board. Right. Okay which would have been on the front of your paper . Yeah but he we didn't have any Right so as soon as you see that you think, Ah volume of a cylinder, I know, whee! straight to the front. Look at it and then erm measured it I did I d and then I redid this one and put it in the same scale, Yeah. and then erm the answer I got for this Mm. So divided it by that. you what did you you used centimetres here did you? Yeah. Right. Good. Because that thing you did with the fish tank has shown Yeah. you that you can't say, Well one centimetre is a hundredth of a metre so No. one cubic centimetre's going to be a hundredth of a cubic metre. it's obvious. It's not it might be obvious but it's not true. Okay that that's the big thing they're looking for there. Convert it to the same units, use the formula and then I mean that's a gift that isn't it? Yeah. Mm? Six marks there for nothing really. Imagine them all bringing their mugs to fill the tank . Mm. Now you've got to rework it again in cubic metres Yeah. and work out how many seconds. There's nine marks on that Yeah. really a gift wasn't it? Yeah I mean it's a it would be a joy to do it as well cos you think, I know how to do these. Yeah isn't this easy, this is relaxing. Okay. Erm I think you know there how to pick up quite a few Quite a few more marks yeah. quite a few marks without you learning anything No. that you don't know already. Yeah? Yeah It's just sort of looking at 'em a bit. Erm the geometry one that we didn't look at,you might be able to spot it in minutes, Yeah. you know seconds even. You might be still on it twenty minutes later. Yeah. So keep it for the end and keep it for when you've not only done all the questions but had a quick check through to see have Yeah. you done something daft. Yeah. Cos that's where the marks are thrown away. Not Yeah. not something you can't do but something you've done ten times before. You just make a one silly mistake like. And you just think you know you like you've put metres instead of centimetres on the the hosepipe or something like that and you think, Oh that's not right, that you will spot . Like when you write a letter and you read it through and you think, Ooh I've missed a word out here, Mm. or I've you know run two words in together or something. So that few minutes at the end is important for picking up these extra marks you've been trying to throw away,okay, where you can do it, and the few minutes at the beginning is to look through and find that question wherever it was, that one on the last page. Lot of marks going for it, dead ea And again it's a s it's a joy to do this sort isn't it. Yeah. Cos you can see where you're going all the way through, Yeah. you know that you know it it's nice It's just like nice and easy. and you feel really confident about it, you think, Wow this is piling up the marks . So look for the good ones don't spend too much t There'll only be one little geometry thing Yeah. fiddling about with triangles and circles and stuff like that. So have a go And it's only about two or three five marks. Exactly. So have a go at it when you've done the others. Okay. Well I'd better get off. another one to get to soon. That's mine. That's yours. Right. Practise with that protractor, Yeah. so that you get used to it so that you prefer to use it to the other one. Have have have both , but if you've got bearings It easy to b better . use that . If someone gives you a polygon to draw Yeah. Use that cos it's not not fiddling Yeah. around twisting it. I mean in the time is takes you to do a sketch you can draw accurately Be easier to . draw round it,dot dot dot,draw even if you then sketch it without using a straight line, if you just join up the dots freehand , Yeah. you get a very good sketch and you can see what's going on and you can see the angles. . That's your one. Erm Next week. What's happening about that? Where are we ? I'm on holiday then so er You're on holiday. Right. Yeah. Okay. So is that for What about the week after that? Erm no I think I've got about two weeks off. Okay, so I'll see you erm So we break up on Wednesday that's Friday Friday, So three Fridays. Three Fridays. Yeah.. So I'll see you in about I'd better work out what the date is. Erm Can have a look on the calendar in there. Okay. And probably be an idea if you remind me sometime during that week when I'm due to see you. Alright yeah I'll give you yeah . Just give me a just give me a ring. But er we'll we'll skip the next three then. Alright yeah. Okay. I better remember my tape recorder. Okay. Erm I've found out when the exam is. Yeah? It's erm right at the end of the month of the rest of the exams. Okay. So erm Yeah it's well well at the end of the month. So have you got what's what's the best Morning Mrs . Good morning Doctor. Well now, what can I do for you today? I've been coming for sh three weeks now. And I came to ask the doctor if I could get H R T. And she took my blood pressure and it was too high She chased you. so she didn't give me anything the first time, but she Mhm. The second time. The second time, it was a different doctor again, and she gave me tablets and I can't remember the name. It was I just took the last one on Saturday, and I then threw the Aye. The wee white ones, Aye. Right. Brusc something Aye. So Right. Show us your muscles. Let's see what you're doing to your poor old self. I don't know why I think maybe the, the tablets helped, but erm I was saying I was kind of having second thoughts whether I was wanting to go on the H R T or No. No. No chance. No chance. Not, not with your blood pressure up like that. No er well she didn't say much, but she Well, no chance I can tell you now. Whenever er Just get yourself down. And I thought er and er I had wee tablets that you gave me a while ago,Brusdeximit Mhm. And I was wondering maybe if I'd be better going back on them. Aye, you'd be safer a lot safer on them. And they won't er they won't fight with your blood pressure. Here just let your arm . On second thought, it'd be . Aye. It's, it's amazing how many folk come up to see about it, and they, they decide eventually not to. Doing fine. You're fine but you'll need to stay on your wee tablets I'm afraid. And er I think you can forget the H R T. I will, I felt maybe er when I came up to see, oh I was having all these heavy sweatings. Just was it was really Mhm. Mhm. pain up sore back, so. And Falling to bits. to bits . then I had another I had another wee problem that I'd been, I had been to see, and it was Doctor I had been, and the doctor that I saw the last time er I had three big bruises on my back, and she Mhm. says I don't know what this is. But this was a wee sort of lump that I had down at the bottom of my vagina. Right. I don't know whether you would call it a lump or not, I said to her it was like a wee spot. Mhm. So she, she says well I don't know what that is, she says. So I'll send you to the hospital. So I've to go on Yeah. Friday to see Right. Doctor . Right. Now have you got plenty of the wee tablets or are you finished? No, I finished 'em. Finished all that lot. Right, Agnes. Finished them on Saturday. Mm That's how I was, I was saying had been at the hospital, come back and says no, my No. tablets are finished, I'd better go to the doc No, you'd better. You need to get that, need to keep that down because if you do go to the hospital, and they did decide to take that out, they would ne d they would check your blood pressure and they would chase you. There's no way they would touch it at all. So It's no, I don't really know cos the doctor says she didn't know what it was either. Doctor seen it first, she thought I had pulled a hair and it was kind of septic Septic Aye. and she gave me tablets, Aye, that leaves antibiotics. leaves a wee cyst underneath the skin. Is that what it would Mhm. be then? Yeah, that's probably what it is. It it's no really er giving me any No. Just, no. much trouble or anything , but it was just the fact of it being there. It's there. It's there. And it's always a worry when you don't know what's going on. And the trouble is it can turn septic again, and put the whole thing sky high again. But s what about your Dixevit Are you needing any more of them? I haven't got them. I've no I haven't Nothing? been taking them Oh well. for ages and ages. Keep some in the house in case you do get a bad spell. Because they're s they're safe. Would it no be similar to kept taking Dixevit instead of the other ones Doctor ? No. No? No, they wouldn't affect your Wouldn't do anything wouldn't affect your pressure. No. They wouldn't affect your pressure. They're very they're good and they have very few side effects, this is the beauty Aha. of the Dixevit they keep the flushings down, Aye. and they don't affect your blood pressure. Aye. So, stick with them, if, if you're having a bad time, use them. If you don't leave them be. Leave them be. But keep on your wee white ones every morning, Agnes. One at breakfast time, Aye, er I er oh well I took them, took them regular, because Aha. you gave me only thirty, Yes. and that was enough. That's right. So Well, we'll see you in a couple of months again. Er will I have enough to keep me going,? Er yeah. You'll have enough to keep you going for a couple of months. Could I get some ? There we are now. See how the boy takes Zantac Doctor , is there two strength of Zantac Mhm. And he's Yeah. getting the lesser one do you think? Would it be advisable for him to get the higher one? Er He's with the, with the bigger strength you only take one, they only allow you one a day. Mhm. He doesn't really, I think at the moment he takes one and er he doesn't sort of take them like Mhm. constantly or er when he gets the heartburn Er that's sort of thing that's he takes Aye this is this is the very strong one. Just . Aye, just one of these a day. When he needs them. I was going to put the thing in there, but I thought I would ask first before you know. He's still living with you at ? Aha. Hasn't run away and got married or anything? No, not till the sixteenth of July. And he's not running away he's getting . Same thing. Same thing. peace and quiet, What about your own family? You still got them? Yeah. Oh well. Yeah, they're still Still keeping you still keeping me out of mischief. Still keeping Still keeping me out of mischief. Are they keeping you out of mischief? Ah well . Oh aye. Oh aye. Okay Agnes . okay, Right, thanks very much, Doctor . cheerio now. Cheerio. Yes sir, what can I do for you ? I was er I woke up Monday morning right, and I had that and the Monklands on Tuesday, right? Because, and they told m he t he told me to come and see Aye. my doctor in a couple of days to see how it was. Ah, that's not ready for opening yet, Steven. Did they give you any antibiotics? . Aye, he gave me, he gave me some tablets I don't know whether What, what sort of stuff did they give you? I don't know the name of actually. That's it. Erm It was a wee capsule, brown capsule. What brown? Brown and brown and white? Aye I think it was. Ah, is it, is that penicillin? Mhm. Yeah. There's a form penicillin in that. What sometimes happens you s it sometimes comes up to a wee yellow head. Aye. And when it does that, you can put a needle in there and just all the stuff comes out all the yellow stuff that's underneath. How many of the er wee capsules have you got left Steven? Oh, maybe about half the About half the amount? Aye. About maybe about half. Right. take See you do. Is it four? Or three a day or four a day. Three or four a day. four. Er I would keep on with those right till they're finished and then come up towards the end of next week. Let's have a look at it again. Mhm. It might be ready for opening, or it might just have dissolved away itself. Aye. Sometimes it dissolves away itself. But occasionally that one it's sort of in between, it could come out Aye. to the surface. Get a needle and . Or it may dissolve away itself? Yeah. Or it might disappear itself, but don't put, don't go putting bandages on it. Don't put leave it alone. And it will go either it will come up to the surface itself or it'll just disappear. Mm. It depen it depends on your own system but it's come up a wee bit . Aye and what happens is, it usually starts in at the corner of your finger Aye. and then it spreads down towards your knuckle. Aye, well, that's That's what's happening. It sometimes goes the, the colour as it, as it starts to heal up the, colour gets a wee bit lighter Aye. and ste starts to spread down towards your next knuckle. Mm. That's okay. No terrible worry about that Steven. Right. That's okay. And er That's fine.. . See I've been getting a kind of rash on my face Mhm. Right. even see it now, there. Yeah. You can see it quite clearly. And you're Can you? getting it on your forehead Aye. as well. Aye. . Aye. see like, see like some kind of spots for the past few Yeah. months and I can't. Only in er Bullmaster one. Oh, you shoved it up sc , oh! I can't get into the banner to move it! Well put er, hit fault. Default. What do you mean? What are you talking about? What do I wanna do fault for? Shut up! Oh no don't hit the middle fucking bollock Too late! Mark ! Oh it's brilliant innit! That ought to do it! That's alright, just do a control C. Yeah, just do a control C,! No I wanted a There you go. We we'll laugh ! Fucking hell ! Wanted to do a That's brilliant! Exactly the same problem again! Don't ever Oh God! Too late! Mark, you should say what you're going to do before you do it! I got no S S T talk today? No. Ain't those batteries run out yet Mark? Well I se No. see they're still working. Yeah, just about. What you got round your neck for then? Just a poser Well when he pisses off I can put the radio on can't I! You're just a poser ay Mark? Sorry? Put your radio on. Keeps turning it on when you see it now. Well I can't hear what he's saying then can I? Well you can't fucking hear anyhow! You still hit the fucker when he says don't! No, he says it too late! Should always say it like at least half a second earlier. There's loads more now, look at this lot! Yeah I know. They're all the with er Eric. Oh I got rid of that one. Doo doo The V back one right? Yeah, but they're they're not really a problem are they? Because this one As long as it , as long as it goes in Yeah. onto that thing. Yeah, but you really should I mean A D characters not traced right? You really should check those. Oh I have checked them. But I was, I just bought you down here just to have a look. Oh right. Erm I was . which report bar's that the Con one? I just ran Con again and to add the new bar to see if that be back one disappears. Hang on a minute! Er type the or moor the er con You will see more. Cos it o , there's erm a set up safe I didn't see eighty four before. There's a set up that checks a certain amount of areas and then blanks it otherwise you could be sitting there for hours waiting for a new Con activity so you just chew them off bit by bit. Right? Oh, so that isn't all the problems then? No. Ah! So once you've chewed those you should run it again? Yeah. Oh I didn't realise that! We should run it again anyway! Ah! So,you gotta run it again haven't you? Yeah. Well I haven't had that problem before though. Cos you've never run it again have you ? No, I do. No, I do, I do normally I I'm pretty careful. The thing I was getting so pissed off cos I've run it about ten times now, cos you keep coming and do alterations! Oh God ! Andy says, oh we've gotta add a new buffer in here so I'm shifting stuff around and adding capacitors and Right. De dum , ay? Ah ee! That's your boss! Listen boy ! I don't fucking know! How the hell am I supposed to know where he is! They're looking for you! It's like asking me where Justin is! ! He's at college today isn't he? Oh that's good news! Supposedly, he should be, yes! That's different! He must love Tuesdays so it means he can have an extra lie in bed! They don't start till nine do they? That's a lay in? Well to be honest well if he he Wanna see something clever? Go on. Little window up here right? The thing about co-ordinates why? You get a little cross in that window Mm. then zoom. Oh isn't that lovely! Look! you can see it's That's lovely! Cos what I tend to do is I do a full board there find out Yeah. where it is and then zoom. Yeah. So you've, actually saving Clicked up on the C N C. Yeah, just turn all items off in that window all full board right? And then, what a so, you get a huge star there you just zoom around about erm Isn't that lovely! and you're there. And can you zoom off? Experience mate! Can you zoom in on that window then? Or is that always full board No it's type window? it's exactly the same window as this, you can edit in it, you can do everything. It should go past the window. So how do you how obviously you do you have the cursor in here when you hit zoom? Yeah. And then you go in there. And then yo , you edit box in there. If you had it in there it would actually zoom that way? Yeah , I mean if you go erm if I go zoom here right? And then, quickly here That does that, right. Right? But then if I go zoom in here Oh I see. and I go into that pad, say Single level three. and you can't see it cos I got all items on but Yeah. you just get a picture of that pad there So the all items on and off are completely separate from the two windows? Yeah. And is on? Yep! Wonderful! I like that! It's just one of those little things you learn when you working on as many bloody years as I've been now! No, I've never used an extra window. Yeah. I ha , I do in Ace but not in Bullmaster It's just a good way to mark it. But ones like this to me, I think they're cos if you Yeah. just lay the trace over the top of the pin it doesn't come out. Yeah. Yes, that should physically click on the pin to get the wire to connect. Oh I do! Do you? Mm mm! And then do a But in terms of, in terms of actual copper, I mean it is actually when the, when the plotter goes over that pad that is gonna be connected. Yeah, but it's still worth checking though. Oh yeah! But I mean they can be left can't they? Yeah. It's pointless trying to output them again. And you hear what say yesterday isn't it? What's that? You just only a piece of little metal. Ha! Sorry? In lunchtime you come in here and say whe where's the board? Oh! I thought it was in, you said oh! Piece of little metal is! Yeah, he's er gotta look out that guy ain't he? Yeah but Well he's stupid over everything! When you skive, you skive you don't let people know you're doing it! But we tell him, long, long time and he just well said well yeah, yeah! That's it. And totally honest. Don't,, I mean what I trying to help him you know the guy he's in work Yeah, I've already looked at that one it's alright Bedge. Yeah, but some people won't take advice will they? Well tha , that was very rude to come fucking , a lot of things and he just say Told him, yeah. If he'd he'd have got I had a go at him the other week using a fucking hire car! He took his car down to the actually ! It was a hire car? I don't mind if he asks you, he says look I'm just gonna go over stores , he took it off fucking site, didn't even know that's where he was going! Yeah, oh I know! Stupid burk had gone on a crane like that Yeah, yeah! tell him to fuck off! He's had it now! Yeah and you're responsible for it. But I've gotta be responsible for it. Yeah. Bastard! He was none too happy! Ha, God ! How can, how many ? I'll be very surprised if . Must be bloody ! Especially if this thing . Yeah, it's If they chop it off as well, I said they fucking blinding you like hell you'd have Well yeah and yeah! I bet he'd speed it up! Cor it's a lot slower when you want another network innit? The old monster! Oh good it's one slade one now. Yeah, Mm. Well no you're well it's, it's a stand alone, but all your files are not Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! What you got? I think that's . I just did that. Oh right. See you also get the bit up there with signals in this don't you? don't give a shit! Mm. And window. Oh it's lovely dovely They're all the pins and the veers that it goes through. Yeah. All the pins. No veers. Ah ! Ooh! Oh ho ho the whole lot ! Well we have got Take this backwards ! erm You can't . He said all about four days left to get this tested then up and running. Yeah, Frank knows it's gonna slip. It might, I've gotta Erm So that I'm actually full time after today. He can't of done! So get me to do it, it's only Yeah. gonna be me and Paul fixing all the design and that on it Yeah, he says . and you Right. hopefully. You'll be giving us It's gotta have a shelf so it'll be a whole drawer won't it? You done all the converting? Yeah I mean we did the fourth but I haven't done the ball to be honest on this one. I started reading up on it. You know I've done all the schematic components. Oh like getting thirty four bars to a hundred. And how do they do it? There shouldn't be that, there shouldn't be that big a board really should it? Well you get Yeah, but the trips he's using are big. Is it on his own or what? Should be something like that type of board. Well I hope it's . No, well no we're not using the LCC's, using dips. What are they, forties? Forties and thirty twos, I think. Well there's only a what One of them's and all. Yeah, but you've got all your microcircuitry on there. We're gonna have a R S fifty two, erm H D L C Ah course, that's not showing is it? That's right. So you got those Oh it'll be a double euro then. At least. I've got a box for a double euro card. Don't wanna tell them they're se , they're gonna smoke. Get on doing work will you? Erm I've gotta wait for Andy, I dunno what the fucking hell he's done! It should be documented. Cos if you got in by bus this morning ain't he? Well . I should do that. And it keep saying and it keeps saying there's a what erm slabs of concrete to be defined. Oh! Oh! Every single thing will be . That's not perfect though! That one's coming back already. No! You knock it off by, what was it? Er was is it? You're supposed to curl it up in a, in a erm in a brush when you blow dry it you know. Keep the perm in there. I'll give you a blow job! Did you ever see me when I had mine permed? What, yours? You never fucking You! did! You never had it in a fucking You remember when I had a perm don't you? Oh yeah, you looked a right tart! I looked a cunt I remember that ! I looked a complete asshole ! he had a fucking perm! You didn't see me then? It was like it wasn't as long as Bedgeys but it was really tight and really you know? Cos his is like I dunno Sweep How his is How his is Sweep! How long ago? But mine How long ago? Oh erm before I was married. About five years ago. Five, six years ago. God I don't believe it! Bloody was as well! I bet you looked a lovely boy! Of course, you haven't got enough hair to perm you know ! That's what I say! No, it was, it was quite long. You must admit , my hair is the worst,fa falling out since! No, got quite, quite a nice perm. It's thickened it up at the front innit? You think he's joking! I got a photograph, I'll see if I can find it, bring it in. Yeah. I got a perm. Yeah, well you've had a perm ain't you Yun? Yeah! No! I just It's like It is! You've had a perm? It is! A China man with a perm ! That used to be quite a thing actually. Well it wear tomorrow, you know they have. I haven't, no! Oh Nigel used to have a perm didn't he? Who's that? Nigel . Did he? Yeah. When I first met him it was really curly you know, and I Bu just thought it was his natural hair but Yeah but my my my perm is not the really the curl, like hi his was set nicely. Not like what bloody curly all hair! People must er think you're a pratt! I did! No, not Bloody Chine China men always have straight hair don't they? No,i it's not really what curly perm, is just like the er er a wave perm in it. Oh wave, yeah. Ah lovely! was saying. Have you Well photograph of it? Yes, I have tha , the really horrible one? That's true! Brilliant! The wedding photo At least mine's natural! Ha! Ish The wedding one a what, you know. The two mark co-ordinate windows. Yeah, one for one end, one for the other. Yeah what I do is, I have specified so I If I suspe the numbers are quite close I put one in there have that, and I just do reverse around and you Yeah. can see the other one might rub off. Do you know why I back to Norman ? Yes. Norman? Won't be much. Won't be now , he's a Londoner he's bound to have had one! You must have a ! Yeah, but I won't say! What's the problem? You have to hit it again. Well to be honest I got too many bloody windows up there! I got Ace up there now you know. So you aught to be careful! Alright. Why? Too many windows, it'll crash! Well that's alright. Well you can open There it is. It's that one and it's that one colour. Well I'm sure it'll be alright Bedge . It'll be alright on the night. Fucking airline now! Well that's alright innit? Hope it's not fucking connected Well I ra work ! If you go on a st If you go on a stat it says no airlines! How do you account for that? What? You look at stat which I just ran this morning right? My file called stat it says zero airlines. Don't beli Did you just delete that? No. No I didn't fucking touch it ! You didn't? Well what's that? No, oh. Have you put a different file name in? Nope! Just do more stat and it'll say zero. Total length of airline, zero. So I sa , I took it that that was it. Now more the one you just did. I just did. No, it couldn't be. You ju erase it, it won't allow you to over , overwrite it. Got to take them out the root. See so that's why you should check the con activity you see. Ah! You always didn't I they tell you? I do, that's why, I always do. I do stat, con and rep after I've done D L C. No I wasn't about to go down and do the bizz Tell him off! Bedge, come on, tell him off! You've gotta be able to run a little tidy up programme, we should just get rid of all these stubs and things! It's like, tell us what's in the software. Er Come on Bedge! So you're tell him off! Good job we ran this innit? Yeah, if it'll . Now what was the file you called when you ran sa when you ran stat I called it stat I'm sure I did. No. Put it in the box. In there. Hang on. Kick the mother fucker! No, woh! No, hang on! Hang on a sec ! I just wanna see if it's been erased since we've been digging around. Probably has you see. Right, okay. Point select. Forwards er No airline! Why don't you run with airlines on all the time? Well I've got confused! Well if i if it comes up and tells me there's no airlines there, then I can assume that there's no airlines! That's right! It didn't! It said there was zero air , that means th there's none there. What do you mean none there? Well there's one there now cos we just connected it. If you a, right I reckon what's happened, you've done a delete on a signal at some point right? And it hasn't been pulled up on the airline? No, you've when you do a delete erm if you do con ex signal, if you have that on signal it deletes the whole signal, airlines and all. I always have it on sig as much as poss . It defaults the sig That's, that's usually what happens. Anyway that doesn't solve the problem now anyway! Oh my God! So we gotta do the bloody thing again anyway! Yeah. Do you want me to put this one in or do you want the other one to go in? I wasn't told! ! Well I I mean I was, I was relying on the, on the . It's, erm, didn't you do these things like erm join the numbers up when you were a kiddy Yeah. You know, in these little books? It's just like that. That says that said to me zero airline so I thought ah great, it's all connected! You know? Well the con activity test told you it wasn't! Well I hadn't got through that had I? I would have discovered once I'd been through it all. Good Lord! Ooh no! Ooh no! That one's get it like that red well that number's moved. Yeah. It goes blue, green, blue, green, blue That's a bit of alive. Hang on! Blue, blue, green Boo ber ber ber ber ber . Right, that's green. Blue. We bring that one red down there. Doo doo . Move these around. We can go no we can't cos of that. This'll be a good one! Do you want to do it? Yeah, I can do it. ? Ow I mean we might as well pitch it now. Pitch those plots. Hang on a sec ! Wha what's happening here? That can come right down here and then blue underneath. Pull that one down. Well I just wondered why it goes there, in It could go down one couldn't it? It goes hold that. Well it's as broad as it's long really. Mm. That just says a bit. Mm, no. It just means changing it. This is the same thing though? Yeah. A bit devious isn't he? One things gone down there. Well Mark did it didn't he! Well the problem is, is that you don't like teeing off do you? Don't like teeing off signals. It's gotta be Yeah, you could of done come off at a pin. So Yeah but you could of come across Well I couldn't from there I remember working on that one and I did it because all this lot was a ,. I just pulled it up from that bottom. Probably this again. Oh but you see It's alright, look I mean that one Hang on! Yeah, but I mean that one you could of shifted this lot put some kinks in this one a bit, right? Moved all that lot up. Yeah but I don't like putting kinks in! You could of gone round with the kinks It's horrible! The kinks Well yeah but it's better tha , I mean that's that's like a bus signal and that's like a ser ,this one that's going round. Is that now? That straight? What you doing? That straight? What's straight? That light. Which one? That one. That one isn't. I know that one isn't! That it's an zoom delete it. This is difficult really. They're gone now. Look! Look at that! Alright! Don't fuck about! Oh no Mrs! Oh No! Gotta go! No. It's gotta go! No. You don't think ahead that's the trouble! I do! You're a cunt Bedge! Patronising bastard! You gotta think head! I think head everyday! You've left a C print on there. Hang on! You've left a It's alright! C pri I'm getting the poxy bloody grid! I why do I have to work with that grid? Cos you can see what you're doing then. Oh! No, it's all naughty and I find the horrible! if you have the grid on you don't miss airlines. I believe you! There's a segment there left! You just make sure What the hell did that jump across there for? There's a fucking segment on there! I told you there's a bloody segment, and does he listen? No! He well he never listens He just goes and clicks the bloody buttons! he never listens to you anyway Bedge ! Look! If the Ah it's still a bloody segment innit? my God! That's awful isn't it? Ah! And look at that! Look at these D L C's you put in there look! That's gone, right! Let's just do board delete that'll probably help won't it? Okay, so I'm coming from here You delete up to there! What's that? Oh it's the big airlines. Yeah, yeah, that's the one yeah, right. Ah like a bloody I'll leave you at it! I'm glad to hear it! God! Run you over! I'll get it sorted and I will do it again! Cor, I dunno ! Look Dave, look! Clever boy! Charge up my batteries cos of my aeroplanes. Oh you're into Got my charger. aeroplanes are you? I'm into model aeroplanes, yes. Oh dear! Well , not recently but I'm hoping to get back to it. When I er when I get the time. Yes, yes. I'll have to From the Hollies take . the Hollies Yeah. Well the trouble is they're so small now aren't they? Yeah. Because they restricted the area so much if you got a big plane that like, to by pass now. It's all gone again now. There was one Don't have a lot of time to think,You know ! there was one bloke over in erm tha you know, with a man la , that I used to work with and he, he used to fly from Hollies , and he lost his plane one day and fle , flew out of range and er he he spent weeks looking for it! Couldn't find! Because th the the sort of corn and barley would, was er was almost ready for Bloody! er harvesting, and he was frightened that he was getting a bit panicky cos if, you know, frightened a combine had had run over it. So But he went and hired and plane from Richmond Airport Oh God! Must of And th cost him a fortune! this guy flew him round and he saw it! He spotted it from there and he wen , went and got it. Probably cost him twice the amount! To hire a plane than the thing's worth! Well yeah! I have heard cases of erm planes being lost in in er crops chu chur churned up! Mm. Farmers aren't happy ! No I know. But there's a couple of guys in another division over there that they were quite keen on er aircraft and they spent weeks building these bloody things and then er, and experienced flyer he'd taken over to the other, other side of the estate when he had a bit of runway over there Aha. and fly them, and they usually flew for about ten seconds and he smashed it! And they came back for another fortnight of re-building ! He said I saw too much! Where's that bloody kettle? Two weeks after he'd said Haven't we ten second flight! Hasn't Yunny put the kettle on yet? He's just gone. He's just gone What a to get it. what a lazy bastard! I'll bloody steal his notes Yeah, when I first I used to fly, actually screen flying. Mm. Tremendous you know! I had this plane a a low four nine engine and I was only a kid. I bought it in village in Mark's Wood I used to take it up the runway and Yeah. took off and I was circle ground, it was quite a windy day then this stood there with me , had no control over the thing, like! And it er I think I think the engine cut at about Well Norm is stepping outside. Is he? Oh! Is he? Yeah. Ooh, my God ! I'm a man myself, ha? But er, is he though? Erm yeah er e , I couldn't hit, you know, just went outside and er what was this? Er, I went out the next day to go to er th yeah that was a Sunday I lost it. And before I went to school on the Monday, drove back down the marsh and went in this forest trying to find it. And we went round this estate can't remember where it was and erm thought knock on the doors and se , ask people had seen it and then later in the day this woman phoned up and said she saw a couple of kids walk down the road with it and sort of ca , called them over and said oh I heard that his, his . So I got it back. That was lucky! And it wasn't broken! I was Yeah? absolutely flabbergasted! That was a bit lucky! Could of been a gonner there! Could of been indeed. Drink? Well drop one, they're still looking. They're still looking. No, I I got plenty of time, I'm not in a hurry. Cos I I got plenty of time. Still looking. Is there still the news about carrying here? Oh I could do. I I I I think that's one of the options that I could sort of er I could still be the li , cleaner over here. If I ain't got a job by June I could still be here cleaning. You gotta take a pay cut then? Oh yeah well er well wo I'd take a pay cut because erm well I'd have to take a pay cut anyway, but the thing is though, with my pension with my pension from day one I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway. If I can take home a hundred and twenty quid well with my seventy pound a week pension two hundred quid. So I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway. I mean, sort of er you know Well, it sounds alright. Probably make a bit more hours, and course there might be er a a couple of hours a night, it'll probably be I reckon it'll probably from five to about er seven. The proper hours. And thing I suppose. Well the thing is, I don't think they're gonna put stran , they're not gonna put a stranger over here. Who don't know the job. Well, it's a bit risky for security as well isn't it? Well yeah! They're not gonna put, they're not gonna put a stranger over here are they? Really? I mean they're gonna you know? I mean, if I sort of just stay for a, for a while but er I've still keep looking for work looking for a job cos I do wanna get away from B T. The sooner I get away the better! But I'm not in a hurry at the moment. So I can't go anywhere anyway. I wanna erm hopefully er hopefully I can get myself a car once I get the money. Buy one. Weren't gonna splash it all out you know? All at once? No I wouldn't splash it all out but I'd get quite a bit cos of the twenty years. I've still got my, er get a car for about a couple of grand. Get a second hand car for a couple of grand and er I'll still have a little bit. We might pay some of the mortgage off and er er, if there's any you know, we sort of keep some in there. Keep some in the Yeah. building society. At least, at least if I had another job you see and er well I'm taking home two hundred odd two hundred pound a week. Well I worked out a hundred and twenty here and seventy pound pension. I wouldn't need to touch that money. That'd still be erm that'd still be in the er still be in the building society could be making me money. Yeah. I mean er You get some er the old interest There's the can't you? Well especially if you put it in your high interest. Yeah. Which once I've wo , which I will. The trouble is with high interest account you can't get the money out very quickly can you? Ah? You can't get the money out very quickly. Just give them plenty of notice like er a month's notice to get the money out. Oh well, yeah. That er So if you need it in a hurry it can be a problem. Yeah. Well we could have it in a ordinary account it's sa , still sort of er . You know? Just report or not. I might be able to some in er, in the ordinary account and some in the high interest account. Yeah. You could do that can't you? Oh yeah, split it up as you like! Oh! Oh yeah, but er but I'm not in a hurry anyway. I've got plenty of time. John! Right. Your tea cup got . How dare you ! Phone! Okay, boy Oy, slaphead! Me? Yeah, the chap from Arkworth Generation for you. Excellent! I'm not sure this machine the actual driver board can I know. Yeah. Because I've been trying to swop between that one and that one. In that we see the one coloured drive right? Yeah. We can re resist the and run from to that copy. When Bedge got it in I say look le I I wanna swop it see what happen. And I took, he swop it he he wouldn't three sixty two. No. I'm not sure, is it the driver that's the problem or not? So you may have to ask Norman if it'll now work. I think we will blame the or th all got in, got in. We will have some money left behind not a lot. Cos the machines in my old office all of them, all the five and a quarters agree both types. And the three and a halfs agreed with seven twenties. Yeah. Yeah! I mean this one can I mean what is what's the point in a, in a drive that'll rig one point two but not three sixty? Useless! And erm the one I got, in there can rig well three sixty K and one point two meg, no problem! As soon as I charge straight into here, what happen with it? I think it's something to with the, with the actual er driver board. Yeah. And you get all set one wha erm setting. You gonna have, you can't have a few. So we may have a, quite another a board or what? I don't know. They will let you know. They'll have to! If I could get my . Then I could have that machine and Justy can have mine. One. What I'm trying to say is that yo ,i now you gotta order another to , forty six. How do I know what's having ? Who's getting the other one then? I dunno. Mm. I have a lot of feeling right? That's it's . When these boys has come along and Colin would he look at John and what do boys say? Well he can't have yours cos he's not doing compiling that No. needs fast processing time. Tony is the one who will definitely jump up and fucking , but I tell him to fuck off! But Colin I mean Frank said to you you can have Yeah. cos you need it for your work! Yeah, but Frank did tell me to keep it, keep quiet! Don't make any don't make war! I don't know it, so I keep quiet. Don't make Yeah but as soon as he walks in here he'll go, ah new machine! Yeah. How's that then? Well you'll have to convince that it's, it's just a three eight six. Cor God! That amazes me why people, it's like a status symbol they have to have the best bloody machine! Well there's no point! But, I have Bedgey look to be honest right he do more compiling than me. If he want the forty six , I mean the forty six I give you this. And he, and he say ah no, but it's alright I got my . But, he said if if Franky order another one he say, I shall have a forty six. Be , originally they order two forty sixes one for Colin and one for Andy. Mm. But when the money tight and they, they can't get the bloody thing! Yeah, well you haven't got it yet anyway have you so Well, I will, I will get it and all the will come in here and we'll hide it or whereby no no, no one will fucking see it! And go, I set it up all working and there's fuck oh ho! It is isn't it? Oh what a pity! Can you stick in that box? But the thing is, they look so different. Don't they? And like Ian's four eight sixes, it's so different to one of those it's not like you can get away with it. Completely different, re-designed box and everything. You still using that monitor? No. Wo , have a look at this monitor? Ay? Come here, it's your monitor, everything. So I can have that monitor with that machine, ha? Yeah, you, you can get everything. Oh right. But we asked erm Colin,di did he want a monitor? And he say no! Mm. Th , the super V G A is better than the, just the V G A. They can give you twe , two hundred two hundred and er, fifty six colour. So Is this V G A or E G A? That's a Philips, a V G A. Is it? It's a normal, it's like your one, it's normal V G A. Oh! Sixteen colour. If you open tha ,ma my window, the picture is compared with the wha you put in there . Oh yeah. So I don't know what is going on! So I'm not over exciting . A Bloody politics place ! Well you got a valid reason for having a fast machine. Right! I better get the out then. And my bloody ! Ow! Well, and I put an order in to buying erm two more of these five and a quarter inch. It'll rebo Mm? That will,wi tha tha will rebo soft. Yeah, but I think th , probably the thing with number Then the driver innit? Well if it can't, it can't. Yeah well there's a problem with that because they might be on different project number mighten they? Yeah but doesn't matter! In this group, doesn't matter. In other group, maybe. Mm. In this group ,. So if you want a se see er er a normal reception you want some some level if you want what? One. If you wanna thick one want a monitor this way,, but not a lot. So you don't wanna put all that in. But it does or some order. But whereas anyone order from this company say well what do you want? Do you want a big one or a small one? If you want a huge order oh you can look for your own. When Len sent them a five pound order, or ten pound Mm. you can leave that . Th there is a if there is work in our group, no problem! As soon as we've been , all been We'll have to write that one with a indelible pen. Yes. You only get on go at it as well. So that is I dunno, you get it off with spirit I suppose. Maybe, I think you can get erm erm in, what they done on Norman's they're using a tape. A tape? Oh that's messy! Er well if you're gonna draw the line I mean I mean it's bloody we know what who's in, who's out. Yeah. Yeah, have a chat with Norman. Okay. The only problem is, I dunno if there's a mistake on this but this modem box right? Is one six one and this is it's ha! You're hoping! Yeah. It's not going into anything is it? No, it isn't, it's not got a socket or anything right? It'll have Norm! Yeah. it'll have four How do you change Look likes the actual box is one six one, this is one sixty right? Yeah. Cos I put erm So that's gonna be a bit small, but a dimension in there. we're not gonna have these connectors on so we all can do whatever size we want really can't we? Yeah. Talk to me! Cli ,wha what's the depth? The depth is erm six four one. four one. So how big's that? That will take us is it clear up Oh right! to there, to here. Erm Yeah, okay. Well what we can do No, what we'll do first ride is put in a connector, you know those connectors? Yeah. That these fellers are on? Yeah. You can get them with long pins each si have them standing up the board and then you have another board, a board with a so you can That's what I was saying! cut the pillars those there. Perhaps, yeah we might find that by the time we got to might not be able to get it all on. Cos that is like a sixth of the area isn't it? What we'll do alright? Mhm. I reckon . If we erm I'll get a if I got time today. Alright? Yeah, so basically Then, yeah, we'll just try and get through today. Start , see what the actually gonna do. Yeah, like , yeah? I mean all the chips will fit, but you gotta . Am I that boring Frank? I didn't Yeah ! say anything you know! No, not half! I didn't. But I di , I didn't realise that I thought you were actually. How old did you think I am? What an insult! Erm He's not that old are you? No, no . I suppose about be erm fifty nine. No, no no no, I'm . Erm, so you had to have didn't you? Erm, I , yes. Yeah,yo , we well we won't do that . Erm, I probably do all that but I don't . How are you? Fine, thank you. I've got a Find your headache, but Surviving? I feel a lot better. Oh well. I went for a walk out this morning but I just couldn't stand it. No. it's no good I'm gonna have to go out for a breath of fresh air. I'm better going do you? But I've got to be honest with you you know. No So he says I'm going out I said oh I feel I'm going out for half an hour that's all. Yeah I can't see the pleasure you know. So you seem a lot better Got a lot of washing to do lie down Yeah he'd like that. Yeah, he'd like that. I know but I thought So I've bit busy with other things anyway. I thought what I'd do was I'd have a bath, I thought I'd put all the back in the fridge Yeah. and I've gotta put that erm on tonight as well. Yeah. So that might be as well. Yeah. See I don't feel as I did last night but it's still there, you know I just take some more tablets like, you know. Yeah. But er Nearly getting rid of it but I've really cracked it and it's bloody awful! It does No oh aye, it does. Really cold, really, it's horrible! We didn't do him any good at all. Telling me he got six points for a driving convic for er speeding conviction Halfords I should think Oh right! When he got erm Oh Smell it. See if it smells alright Got any Oh We have to that's why Aye Mm Too much I got your er table things. They do them in packs of fifty but in Oh a split pack I got sixty. That should be enough, shouldn't it? Oh Or did I get seventy? I think I got seventy just to be sure. I thought sixty Oh alright. That's alright. was enough so I got seventy Oh right. cos there's only fifty Yeah. So I got seventy. As I said, they do, they must do them themselves and sell Oh right. They've got a well in that shop. Oh have they? Yeah. It's all bricked up. What else you've been doing? Oh I've done a bit of drawing. you wanna get your hair cut while you're there Yeah. Yeah, I ought to go and get changed Yeah, well don't stand about Yeah, that's alight. I'll get Oh yes. changed. I'll just leave them ticking over then? Yeah. I won't be long. Yeah, okay. Just go and get myself changed. Yeah, I mean you see works' vans all over the place regular. Yeah. Naughty boys! I never thought about that. ha oh. Not if they keep his licence. No. Speeding. Dangerous driving. Dangerous driving cos he made the old woman give over and overtook somewhere totally stupid and probably find he had no brake. He was slowing down anyway! What are we gonna do? It's spitting and spotting innit? Yeah. Fancy having another cup of tea? Yeah. That's if you look at it, like, you only get two chances at speeding now. Mm. Which is harder than it used to be. Must've been four then wasn't it? Yeah. Three points Like you get four gos. Yeah, that'd be right. Get one more go than you used to now you get one left. Tightened up on that, haven't they? Mm. Don't half your er insurance now, don't it? You get Yep. a speeding doesn't, never did anyway, bother them. No. Not unless you had a dangerous driving or something with it. But er losing your licence always has bothered them, hadn't it? Mm. That's always cost you. is there? A very old Granada Mm. way back Aye. Ah, yes it is Yeah. Yeah. Probably buy Hundred quid. Hundred quid Yeah. Aye. And he had a dangerous driving or a speeding I think it is Mm. horrendous insurance bill He says I can't afford scrap. Cost him more. Cost him about six or seven hundred quid a year. Cheaper to buy a blimming er cheaper to insure a car wouldn't it? Mm. Oh no matter what he gets, it's always over five hundred quid cos he's he's Yeah. lost his licence in the past and you know, when he was a kid like Mm. and all that Takes a long while before they forget about that, doesn't it? Yeah. Making himself an extra five hundred pound a year for er having been a naughty boy when he was a teenager. Mm. That's what it's about now, innit? Yeah. It's all the He is actually quite sane now though. Yeah, well it's like this fellow that got done for speeding. When did he get done? Er Thur no Wednesday. sat there watching them catch him up he didn't see them before they got him stopped like. Saw them catch him up coming along with all their blue lights thinking . They'd been in er garage at bottom. Mm. Aye. We'd had a little car before he got there. He said are you speaking to the no, no,around town he says, I don't mind doing a bit more, you know, out and about not much about they just sat in the traffic, you know. Mm but erm so had it been a Foxhalls, something about a minute no, he said only for about a mile, that was it. I said oh, about forty seconds and he sort of looked. I says well, at sixty you do a mile in a minute. So I said if it's only for a mile it's going to be well less than a minute at eighty, presuming you were doing more than thereabouts and er that was it. But the car, he'd er he says oh that was funny he says, I blew past him, popped into fourth, I blew past him real easy going up the . Come out at Foxhalls at forty, I think he did. He can come through Foxhall like and he, he'd had to speed up he says and then he says he didn't carry on, like. He hadn't been doing and er reckon he and er think I'm and that was it so right Been driving since he was nineteen two or three months ago, I think it was. I remember him saying once before I don't, I don't know what and er he says it's only a fortnight ago since you know . You get done for, pulled up for speeding or parking or something and you can pay your own fine . So I went home, anybody gonna pay me fine? He says I am gonna cop it off me mother cop it of his mother. You're always going too fast! I told you before! He says me dad al me dad was always speeding he, he used to go mad! Mm. slow down. Yeah obviously watching wasn't, wasn't watching his mirror very hard. He hadn't seen copper trying to get him caught up, I wonder how much he was using mirror when he was overtaking people? Mm, yeah. Whether he was just watching what was coming from the front. Mm saw him coming have to get it cos Neil's mum was cross about it. Oh well he was only just finding out what the rules were. There was a gang of us chatting with him. I come up with six points. That made his day. He says have I got a fixed penalty? I says only got a pink form if you've got a fixed penalty. Know somebody who got one, like. No, only a bloke I've never seen one had one. Yeah, that'd be Richard. Mm only he's got to take his licence and insurance in. As to what happens now he says I've to go to Magistrate's Court so it's just beginning to sink in that it's gonna cost him some brass and it's going to be serious. One of them there was of the opinion who could quite easily lose his licence for it. Like he got done What he do? Run a Chief Constable over? No! No, he got done for speeding. He was over the, over the limit and had a small quantity of drugs with it. Don't think he'd actually taken them but he had as a Mm. possession. They did him about eight hundred pounds in motoring offences Aye. Phew! Speeding while slightly over the limit it was. Him having speed having, having speed . Oh god! Mm Where's today? Dunno. He started to come over, didn't he? Yeah. they don't come any worse get a cup of tea in between, weren't we? Mm. I don't think it would've bothered us when it was spitting and spotting if we'd actually been out there, would it, it's just setting off in it. Aye, yeah. Blue sky! I can see a bit of blue up there. today? No if you were off to do something and being mucked around for the day, innit? Mm Took my a long while ago. Not surprised to see them now. Only ran out a month ago! Just as well so late I've been waiting for to come. I got some here come in this morning she says, they ran out beginning of September last year. We hadn't thought about it. I thought I was late. Mine have been in, oh, I don't know! A good month! Innit? A slightly bigger like a fish box Or what? Lobster pots making a smell. yeah, don't, I know name when it come up like that. Anyway we can sort the problem because you'll take them back a won't you?put them outside your house, creating a smell they were playing up. Pretty fair stack of them I should think, wasn't there? Mhm. Don't know if the son's got out yet. Been doing time. Aye. I don't know They didn't catch him He had an argument with a kid, two or three years ago Aye. and er they set off in hot pursuit. It was in back of a pick-up. Driving through with a shotgun shooting the guy Still in the back of a pick-up shooting over the roof, like? Yeah. Oh! They didn't get him for that one? Blimming good job! No, they just got him for beating somebody. Bloody good job. You'd think after that one they'd have thrown the keys away for that. Mm. The kid hadn't done much Get an extra two years for missing. the kid hadn't done much, I mean it was nowt serious . You know I had a moving traffic accident Yeah wasn't trucking there, you know or owt like that. No sense of humour. Got brought a pushbike wheel the other day. Can you get the cogs off that? Why? Well they go a lot better on that bike of mine. I don't think so. Oh pity. So what you've done to bend the wheel? I haven't. The gaffer knocked somebody off their pushbike, had to buy him a new wheel and some compensation Scrounge the wheel! How do you get them off? He says you go to a pushbike shop and get special tools. Ring spanner things with the Mm. keys on the outside pumps and things on it to I wouldn't bother. A new set of back cogs for bike's only about seven quid. A brand new set and they come with the ra with the, erm free wheel and everything all in like, just screw them on. Go to a pushbike shop they whip them off and whip them on for you you buy, you know, if you go out and buy one then just take wheel with you they'll stick them straight on. Mm that fellow don't go to the police. Lucky to get away with having to buy him a wheel compensation Unusual innit. It's very expensive that's why it's unusual. Sixty nine ninety nine. is that all right? It is done isn't It? why have you got that on your head. What's it doing take it off. Oh yeah. take it off Mm. take it off I don't like it, take it off What? What's wrong with you? What? What? He's bloody mad, he's potty, off his rocker. Where did you get it? Get what? The thing. Well why Well why do you need it, why do you need a towel? Why do you need a towel. Why er why game. Mum and Dad's got it. Come on Mum. Go get in the blooming bath. Why? I'll rewi rewind that actually heard what you say, you must be very naughty and nasty thing to be to your son. I can't have a sweet then. Well you're not give me a sweet an all. Should give me a sweet you know. You should. You're gonna turn it off because I wanna tear you off a strip about something. Me? Yeah. Why? What are we talking about? Mum what's Hamlet about? Pardon? What's Hamlet about? Hamlet? Yes. I don't know much about Shakespeare, the only play I've seen is Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream. to er see Rome and Juliet. Mm. And I think I need to make it up. When is I dunno. Well you better find out then. What do ya mean I alw I'm only saying it cos I got Well no if you can go. You give me the money for it? If it's within reason as I assume it will be. Five Pounds. That's okay. W would it make much difference for you lending me the money. Not a lot. Well there's a quite a bit of difference between five and fifty isn't there and the one thing is for your educational needs and the other I'm so convinced about. Well Yeah. I thought a computer No, but I know that you're dying to have a computer, and if money was no object, then we probably wouldn't hesitate in lending it to you, but really and truly at this moment things are tight and we can't afford to commit ourselves with things unless it's absolutely necessary. Well And that's it, I mean I've made it as plain as I can. That is it and I hate it when you keep on and on nagging. I won't go and see Romeo and Juliet. Well don't go, it's not my fault if you don't pass your exams. All right. Did you watch that animated version that you recorded. Yeah. Does it give you the gist of the story? It,half an hour long. Well I think it's longer than half an hour. They probably should an hour at the most. Given you er erm The film is about hour and five minutes. You can probably have a video of it as long of another version. Well it's does help to see different versions because you see that different people interpret the Why do you Mm? Well it depends on the people who are producing or directing or whatever, so it's all got different ways of doing it. When I was studying I went to Open Air Theatre and I saw a version there on Christopher er what's his name that chubby fellow with the glasses Christopher Biggins that's it. He was playing Puck and when I went to see the Company doing it well they had a completely different way of doing it, they wo they did it really like er a dec you know the the mechanical play, I don't know if you know A Midsummer Night's Dream. They did it in a completely slapstick farce way you know th the men who were dressed up women they balloons and had rosy red cheeks and wigs and things, it was quite different. How they Well that's it, when Shakespeare wrote a play and the text has survived and , but the way of of joshing the people on the way they do it is different every generation and even most of the people in the same generation would would have a different way of doing it. Okay. There's a comedienne erm she apparently was born in Wales. Mhm. Two Ton Tessie O'Shea that's her. Two Ton Tessie? She yeah, that's her her nickname, cos she was quite big and she played the nurse in Romeo and Juliet in the season on Stratford on Avon and she did it using a Welsh accent because she thought Shakespeare, having coming from quite near the Welsh Border Country might well have had might well have had a Welsh nurse. So it didn't matter that Romeo and Juliet is set in Italy. Mm. She did it as she would have thought Shakespeare would have known people and things, you know, she did it like that. Mm. And I remember Amanda seeing a video of Romeo and Juliet And what struck me was that the costumes were all sort of like you see portraits of Elizabethan dress. Now I don't what Italy and those Middle Ages would have been like, that the sort of clothes that were worn. Mhm. But the clothing in that film struck me very much as being like Elizabethan dress. Yeah, I mean now plays of Shakespeare and they're wearing modern dress like those worn at Richard the Third or something and they're wearing well either First or Second World War uniforms. Yes. It was very different then. Yeah, well it's just different directors have different things they want to emphasise in a play and if they want to bring something home or they think that using a certain well like say the way the people are dressed and everything will will have more of an impact, you know will One thing I was wondering about you know they they talk about erm in Shakespeare's works is the language the words he uses, the the sort of poetry of it and the symbolism that's used. Erm do they talk about that at all in your English Literature Yes. Do they show you how you can learn about this, there's a book you know the book I bought you it's got notes in it. Does that help with it? I suppose Pardon? Well you should do. And what about I bought some revision books and things study aids or something for Amanda for her English literature Well I bought them for Amanda and she was doing Romeo and Juliet. So if you look in those you may find there's some help there. Yeah. Is there any more last minute entry for the quiz? Okay, sit, sit still, be quiet and listen to this, you ready? Question one which of Britain's colonies is most populated? Okay if it's any help just look at the opening tonight, nothing tricky that, it's just er which of Britain's colonies is the most populated? Question two, which city did Lady Godiva ride naked through the streets of? I'm sure you know the story, which city did Lady Godiva ride naked through the streets of? Coventry. And number three whose was the signet ring which is sometimes known as the fisherman's ring? Okay, whose was the signet ring sometimes known as the fisherman's ring? Question four, fashion model and T V presenter Marie Helvin was married to which famous photographer? Maybe if you think along the lines of fashion That's the only one I know er I'm not supposed to give clues, okay fashion model and T V presented Marie Helvin was once married to which famous photographer? I can see we're having difficulty with these questions no it's just the answers, okay, question five, now this one's easy if you're a surgery, if you have a tracheotomy, where would you show off the scar? Okay The neck if you've had a tracheotomy where would you show off the scar? Question six okay for of the imposed cut in stationery from last year, we ran out of it Come on, come on Good for him. So he was sulking in a corner was he? Yes. Another criticism that I had was that it was far, far too elaborate and expensive programme, I thought it was a very cheap one. We printed it ourselves, Yes, yes The first one, was Yes, yes, Councillor . In spite of a lack of er, sort of er, carol sheets for, for some of us, it really was, as you say, a very enjoyable evening, and I was particularly erm, keen on the, the introduction of Saint Nicolas, and it certainly got smaller children, I think it was er, fantastic, and I certainly haven't enjoyed so er, I'll be back We diddled them out of er, Christmas presents which, which surprised me. But some of the children there erm, somebody must have been very, very, optimistic because we put a lot, a lot of presents in there, but anyway I think it was a superb night, and, and, and the meeting of er, to get together in the fire station afterwards, quite, in the Price Room was very good. Okay. Five point one three, five thirteen, Fire Brigade Long Service and Public Medals Ceremony. Once again a very enjoyable evening, erm, I pushed into something that er, I don't think she really wanted to do initially, but she thoroughly enjoyed it at the end. Chairman, she did it er, erm, very nicely,from the local That's right, that's right. The ladies concerned I think were very pleased er, erm, I do I think it's a very good idea, erm, to give a wife's medal and er, with all the medals, and we ought to provide money for them the amount of waiting about they have to do A very good evening. and they never know when Yes. It was a nice, nice gesture. A well organized evening. And where the beer did agree eventually, I mean under slight pressure. There's a photograph of her,and I'm quite sure we can give Joan to give to Vera one of those. Yes, yes thank you. I, I would like to see erm, I don't know whether this is done, but erm, when the official photographs are taken, they're done by erm, newspaper area, so that you get of the Lord Lieutenant, the Chief Officer, and the, the man from that area, and that is sent to the local paper, whether, ah in fact the local paper actually took photographs on that basis, and they grouped them by Yes, but erm, but Chairman, er, I don't think I should come up and make myself clear, some local papers were not represented there. Could they in future be sent? Could the photograph, the fire, the fire fighter probably won't think of it, could, could we think it for him, or her. Yes, we're lucky with the photographer actually, he's not a fire fighter, er, He is now He is now, okay. Er, five fourteen, paper L. Don has erm, been seconded to the Home Office for a period of two years. So I think we ought to congratulate him on that. Yes Hear, hear. And the other is the retirement of er, Divisional Officer . Could we just Twenty nine year service is a long time. can I be as could we be associated with that? Oh yes, well I, this is a Committee I'm talking about, not, not just myself, the whole Committee. Erm, when I speak, I speak on behalf of the whole Committee. A letter will be written to both on that? Yes, oh yes, yes. Okay. Chair, in respect of what erm, it's obviously it's er, good for the Authority that Mr is er, obviously , but what will happen to his post, right away, and what, will there be someone employed to actually fill in, I know there will probably be some moving up er,? Yes, we're interviewing so we're interviewing on Friday for somebody to fill that post. On the dates that you've anticipated if Mr comes back by that time we'll be able to absorb the post, but it's likely that he may move on from this, because it's a fairly substantial move up. In his next, next work when he leaves here he's going to be the Fire Service at the Houses of Parliament, and I'm serious, that will be one of his first major jobs. Not to mention things as trivial as Windsor Castle, and so forth. You don't sail that far down Will they listen to him, I hope. You're next authority. Chairman, he won't have to, it's like this, he won't have to worry as they did when the televisions which caused the last fire in the House of Commons, I mean, set fire to them and er, caused that one. It's quite er, it's quite a recommendation to de Brigade though isn't it Mr Chairman? And quite an honour to the brigade. Pardon? It's very prestigious, it's very prestigious. Yes, and I think I thought of a personal note that, because we do get some good, good appointments. As bad as we are. Okay we'll move on. No, I, I, I think, it is well done. Six, Quarterly Report of Chief Trading Standards erm, paper marked M. Yes Do you want to s enlarge on it Mr ? No No, no No you're alright Chairman. Can we note this Mr Chairman? There's quite a lot of useful information in here. I hope you've all read it. Yes I have, item, paragraph one, Mr Chairman, is right to do with the work that has to be done. Pardon? Pardon? Item one on M, Mr Chairman, the right of you with the amount of work that has to be done, and the amount of they're asked for Oh yes, yes okay. in growing demand or Six point two, deregulation. Chairman, if I could just er, erm, some words that aren't included in this pa paper, I understand that the Deregulation Bill is published on the eighteenth erm, and presented to Parliament for the first reading, erm, it's still far from clear what's going to be said in it, but erm, it's still widely expected that in fact, on major contentious issues will in fact be the suggestion that sections of Acts of Parliament will, could be revealed by ministerial order rather than go through the parliamentary process again. So it's an important issue er, of principle. The aspect to it is, as I've made clear in, in the, the report I hope,th they'd want to treat each erm, one that comes out of government on it's me merits. Er, I make the point I think that, erm, we should oppose the er, Deregulation Bill if it's based on providing deregulation by Ministers, because I think that's a constitutional point that is of great import, but the, the rest of it erm, are really sets of principles that I hope you'd agree to, subject to amen amendment and dis discussion, because the information that we got is that the consultation period is going to be very tight indeed, and that it might not be able to go through the normal committee procedures in order to put things through erm, with er, proposals in that, er, in that respect. If they're relatively technical, then I, then I'd be grateful if they can be left to the officers, but obviously if there's anything that erm, is political in anyway, big P or small P, then at least we can get in touch with the er, P A G, and if necessary call a meeting in respect Chair. But things are going to move on apace, and we need to, a set of principles the officers can work to, and I've put these down as a broad list, erm, for your consideration. I propose that Mr Chairman. All in agreement, Yes to the recommendations. Yes Paper O, That's purely for information Chairman. Paper P, genetically modified foods. I think the case is here is that er could have serious effects. That, er, Chairman, if I could say the thing that bothers me here is that, it always has done about food, is that we should be keeping up to date with information, all these decisions and all this advice. That seems to me a basic requirement of er, of all the sale of food. Er, it's been coming in gradually over the years, but there's been an awful lot of, of er, resistance by some manufacturers on what they say on their labels, and what they say about what they're selling us, and er, if they're gonna do this, and I'm getting a, a slight suspicion, and I think Mr is, that, that it's got to be done eventually, and we, we have to be able, as a buying public, to understand exactly what we're buying before we actually get it home. A chance to read, and be informed as to what we're buying when we buy it. Chairman, it's always been this Committee's policy over the twenty years, the twenty odd years that I've been here, back here ru runner, that erm, so far as the food side is concerned, er, we should be, our policy should be based on the information, the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and letting people make up their own minds. It's not been for us to tell people what they should or shouldn't eat or do anything with, because the, in, in one respect that's a nann nannying attitude from er, whether it's the legislators saying we're not going to approve the right legislation so that you have that information, but on the other hand by manufacturers and others saying you trust us. Well, in the cases we've taken over the odd twenty years against some of the biggest companies in the world indicate that that isn't the er, position. So, as far as the, the erm, erm,report is concerned er, if I've got to make a recommendation, because obviously people have got different views on this one, it would be in fact that we go for total er, information so that people can make up their own minds, and if, and it might be wrong, but they can exercise their own prejudices. And if they want to exercise those prejudices that's a matter for them. Erm, so that, that's the line that er, from a personal point of view I would erm, I would take, but I would obviously want members' views on that one. The other one, could I just correct something on the last line of er, comment at the bottom of the, bottom of page two. It says stock lives, it should be stock lines. But they are also trying to include the stock live aren't they, in some cases? Not their lives, No, it talks about the life as it's lying in store for instance. Yes, oh yes, yes indeed. Yes Anybody wish to speak or are you, do you accept the recommendations? A question if I may? In the er, appendix attached Yes er, there's talk about the er, government waiting for the recommendations from the Food Advisory Committee, when are they due? It's come out too, Chairman, that erm, there's been an, they dis they discussed that the minutes came out, and erm, what the Committee decided shortly was, the Committee felt strongly that, if the criteria for labelling were met, the requirement for labelling declaration should be a statutory one. They did not consider that this could be satisfactorily achieved by other means, such as non-statutory guid such as non-statutory guidelines. Er, based on the evidence which the public consultation produced the Committee considered that the primary concern of consumers was to be able to identify when a gene likely to be a cause of concern to a significant proportion of the population was present in foodstuff. This was reflected in the criteria which the Committee recommended should trigger a labelling declaration. As far as the form of labelling was concerned they believed that what was required was a simple declaration such as contains copies of X genes, in single ingredient foods and foods sold loose, they believe a declaration should form part of or accompanying the name under which food is offered for sale. For pre-packed foods which contain ingredients that contain copied genes, it recommended that a statement should be required to accompany the name of the ingredient in a list of ingredients. If a copied gene is present in an ingredient which was under current rules, it did not need to be listed, the declaration about its presence should nevertheless be made either in the ingredients list or next to the name of the er, food . And they went on then to consider lack of understanding of consumers about G M technology as a whole, and made recommendations for erm, er, better labelling, and for a erm, information campaign to be launched as well. But they didn't actually recommend that it should be statutory labelling Yes. The point I'd make, is that the difficulty of enforcement, in that respect. It's, it's one thing legislating, it's a completely different ball game when you are, erm, trying to enfor enforce it, and especially when you're trying to enforce it with ingredients imported from abroad. Well, when I say abroad, I mean from the E C as well. Erm, you can look after your own factories in this country, and you source ingredients, but you won't be able to do that for anything coming ov coming overseas. And the major manufacturers erm, there is a major trade in ingredients, between the multi-nationals as they pass things across. So the theory might not well work out in prac practice. But I honestly can't come up with any solution in that respect, because er, until you've got er multi-national enforcement agencies which no politician is going to agree to, erm, you're not going to solve the pro pro problem there. And if they think that it suits them to shift a factory to the Philippines because there won't be an inspection there, that's what they'll do. Can you note this Mr Chairman? That's depressing isn't it really? Very, but there you go. That's life, but we do what we can. And it's a statutory obligation in this country and that's really what you know. Because we can't just accept that, that manufacturers will look after it for us, because as you've, already said by the Chief, they'll move the factory where it I mean, you can even get a situation Chairman, where you'll get some of the big multiples will tell a, will agree specifications with a food manufacturer, but they're not going to be able to check on the ingredients, so even though the, the, the Sainsburys and the Marks and Spencers of this world say we don't want any er,gen genetically modified ingredients going into anything that we're going to buy, there's no way that they can guarantee that before we've even bought any. Having said that, do we accept the recommendations in this report? Yes Authorizations for legal proceeding. Proposed. Agreed. Registration of births deaths and marriages. It's for you Mr Nothing to add, er, if members have any questions I'll be happy to answer them. Noted? Charity Youth Committee, marked S. Do we have a member er, from that Committee? Yes Chairman, I am following in Major 's shoes, I don't reckon I know a great deal about it yet, and I'm not sure that this erm, er, advisory er, committee is yet actually on the go, but I will go into this. The stumbling block here does seem to be the inability of the Charity Commissioners themselves to keep up with the volume of work. Er, I am, Mr Chairman, I support that fully, because if you write to them it's six months before they'll reply. And you're wondering, I mean I don't think we can expect of the advice of charities now, or very little, you know, and, and they've got to be very, very careful I was meeting the Commissioners Pardon? I was leaving the Commissioners out as far as I could. Yes, yes, yes. It's a very meagre budget Chairman I should think we're getting off very lightly. Yes . Item nine, motion evenings and Saturday meetings. I propose that we retain the status quo Chairman. I'll second that I second that Are you all in favour of that? Yes West Mercia Police Authority, Paper C, now you received this late I'd be pleased to answer questions Chairman, and I'm sure Mr will help, help me deal with the budget crisis. And I shall endeavour to Well that's all you've got in front of you at the moment, isn't it, the budget Chairman? You have other things as well. Are there any questions? Pardon? Are there any questions, I'm asking, yes, I'm waiting for questions. Can I make an observation Mr Chairman, will you take observations as well? Yes, I'll take observat why, wait a minute. Yes, erm, on paragraph three erm, the, the last sentence erm, where it says without direct access to its own balances, the authority may therefore have to make revised precept in ninety four, ninety five erm, I understand what's being said there, but any organization needs to actually work within er, a clearly defined budget. Er, the Police Authority last year I think actually had to have an extra nine hundred thousand pounds of spending, the budget was funded by the constituent's authorities, erm, and we've already for next year in fact, made available effectively six hundred thousand pounds worth of extra spending by erm, various means, so I would hope that erm, the authority does use as, as much prudence and restraint in its financial affairs as possible, because of the, the effects on all, all concerned. Yes, Chairman, can I say that erm, when the b the budget's in the process of formulation and we're discussing the question of balances and reserves and how they should be marked for the immediate future, particularly in regard to the way that er, reorganization may take place at police authorities in the very near future, and also those of us who are on this, on, on other committees who've had experience in, and the same sort of thing happening in further education for instance, where immediately the assets, before even the regulations were put on the table, the assets of all these things were, all these er, erm,coll the further education colleges were frozen so we couldn't do anything with them at all as an Authority, and er, actually many of them were taken from us without er, without any question at all . So in the light of that it's per now is a good opportunity to er, make sure that those reserves and balances were available for A, the er, Police Authority should it require it, but B, to those constituent authorities who had helped in the er, build-up of these reserves. Now, what's being said here in that particular sentence, is that there are obviously going to be, or possibly could be occasions when er, the Police Authority has er, an overspend, which is an immediate problem for instance, on pensions, and you've heard the er, Fire Service Chief talking about his problems. They're just the same with the police force, there could be er, er, an increase in police pay,or there could be any, a very large incident which would require planning, if these happen then it has always been the case, if there wasn't the money available then a precept could be put upon us as a local authorities to er, cover that erm, directly. That's no different to what the situation is now, it was there before, the difference is that the banker is different. The banker is not the reserves of the Police Authority, because that has now been transferred to the authority. I should tell you that er, the budget really represents er, an increase in the availability of police resources over the previous years. I'm delighted with that, the budget came out er, much better than I'd hoped it would do, and er, and I, I am sure that we shall see some improvement in the police er, over the next year. Of course there is, there is the possibility, there is definitely going to be a reorganization, we shan't have the same sort of input I don't think, we shan't be allowed to have the same sort of input in a totally undemocratic er, er, authority that's going to be there where the, the governments will er, put er, most of the people on board, where the Home Secretary will decide on the Chairman, er, we don't know what the government regulations are going to say about balances in terms for the new authority. Er, if they say that er, they should be er, a balance or reserve put in by constituent authorities then we will have the money available to do that, if we didn't then they may have frozen the reserves that are already there and asked us to put some more money in as well. I find that is the situation that I've tried to er, guard against with the budget that we've been put in on this occasion, and I hope that answers er, er, Mr but er, I'll answer any other questions that are put up. Thank you very much. Could I say Chairman,in Worcester and Shropshire are in agreement with this budget and er, which has been engineered to a great deal by the Chairman of the Budget and er, we're here to, Yes I don't, I don't mind worked out, but engineered gives a very Regarding paragraph nine Chairman, no doubt you, you would tell us if there's been a response on this, because this does seem a useless step forward er, to increase the number of people at the coalface as it were, and self-financing, and no doubt we shall hear in due course about this. The Authority are pushing as much as they can on the scheme and there's been no response to yesterday. It's a crazy situation, because when Clarke was the Home Secretary, and he made a, a speech in parliament, we adjourned a meeting of the Authority to listen to him speaking, now we'd already made applications er, to increase the number complete officers by the, getting rid of the superintendents, and Clarke came out with what we'd said, yes, do that, but the Home Office are still saying no you can't. Er, I mean the whole lot separately, Yes, yes, I mean it's crazy. if I can comment on that Chairman, the erm, the Authority asked for thirty for next month, along with all the other authorities I think in the country, asked for an improvement in the, in the policing the country, and I think people that live in, in Shropshire, and the people that live in other er, parts of the country as well, would have welcomed the increase in the police force this year, but the government decided not to do that. We, we then had this situation where the, er, the Chief Constable ha went to great lengths to er, work out a new establishment for himself, and the senior management, and actually ach chi and er, and preempted it and then asked the er, the Home Office if he could use the money to increase the constables on the beat. We are still waiting for them to agree or not to that. The feeling at the moment is that they are sympathetic towards us, and they don't see any difficulty in that as yet, but no one is prepared to put their hand up and say yes go ahead and spend the money in that way. But the money is in the budget Chairman, I want to make that quite clear, the money is here in, in the West Mercia Police budget to be able to provide sixteen extra policemen immediately. Police Officers. Policemen immediately that that is given to us by the Home Office. I hope the Authority unanimously do support it. Yes, I think Chairman, you ought to ask your Committee to note paragraph six, I think that's quite important and worthy of note. Because we employ a lot of Can I record we've received this here Mr Chairman? Move the reports received? Yes. Now it is recommended that we in section nine and four A, in brackets four, someone move. Chairman, can he just report to us? Right, Chairman, if we can just go through this briefly. Erm, number thirty six. Erm, it contains access to four, five and they'll be submitted after discussion at this particular Committee, to Policy Planning or the Policy Resources Committee. As we've made perfectly clear in the last discussion we've just had, no final decisions on the implementation of any variations will be taken until Council meets on the twenty fifth of February. This booklet was distributed just before met, so in fact er, paragraph two does say at the moment that in our new recommended programme there isn't, well in fact they did agree those recommendations. In addition though, and we come on to them in a second, it asks for further reductions to be added to that if possible. But the provisional guid the guideline which was set by Policy and Resources in the first instance, was just for this Committee to identify seventy thousand pounds' worth of reductions. Those reductions were those identified in paragraph three and perhaps I do need to point out in fact that according to the report in Policy and Resources Committee, the use of carry forwards from the registration service of twenty thousand pounds in fact needs to be replicated across all three years. Now quite clearly that has er, implications on the registration service and believe the County Secretary will talk about that at some future point. Erm, paragraph four erm, outlines there is a gap after these new guidelines of six hundred and seventy one thousand, and to bridge that gap, the P and R asked that er, the Fire and Rescue Service identify a hundred thousand pounds of sur of reductions from its budget. The audition which is the additional item includes moves at Policy and Resources Committee that they asked all committees to expose further reductions if possible to help close this gap of six hundred and seventy one thousand pounds. Just find it on the kind of introduction. The other guideline which was issued was namely that of capital, where the a accepted the general guidelines which appeared in the county papers and as far as this Committee was concerned, would mean the general acceptance of all those items which appear in that the first year of that capital programme, subject to the proviso that the revenue contemplated and the benefits of the capital programme will be considered by Policy Panel in its forthcoming meeting. As far as the introduction is concerned I have nothing more to say. I am, unless there are any questions, can we not then five, move on to number five? Er, one question if I may Chair? Erm, I note that on paper R earlier, we er, approved the recommendation to ask Resources Management sub-committee to approve the release of three thousand of registration service carry forward monies, and we're now being asked to approve our budget next year, which er, also reduces twenty thousand for registration service. Can we be told please exactly what the er, balancing hand of carry forwards shown on the right estimates, the twenty three thousand consists of? Are they, what, what are those are registration services? That, the thirty three thousand includes twenty three thousand of the registration services carry forwards, but it does not take into account the three thousand which have just been requested here. So that would reduce it down to twenty. I just want to make sure we have the money now. If you, if you like, I could speak now Chair? Yes Er, naturally we're disappointed you're proposing to take er, twenty thousand of our twenty three thousand carry forwards in the registration service. The problem is as Mr has said, if that is expected to be replicated across future years, this would represent a ten percent reduction in the statutory service, er, which is only partly under control of this Committee, with mixed responsibilities with the Registrar General. Seventy percent of the expenditure is on staff who you do not employ and cannot dismiss, a large part of the income, or all the income is through the fees that are set na nationally by the government. You have very little room for manoeuvre within this service, and the Registrar General has reserve powers to impose services on you, and I would have to advice you it would be virtually, or I would have to say it would be impossible to achieve that ongoing reduction in future years. Erm, does the Chair wish er, me to reach section by section, or do you wish to take the bookings as they are Chairman? Well I think we've got to take it section by section. In that case the, the white page which isn't numbered at the back of page three, is the revised estimate, and shows the variations as outlined there. Erm, the only variations which are actually going outside the Committee control are as a result of the internal market variations which are going on down . Plus of course the growth in the Firemen's Pension Scheme of thirty one thousand in the current financial year, rising in future years. Otherwise the Committee services are containing their budgets within original cash limits. If there are no questions on the revised estimates Chair, then the, the base budget for ninety three, ninety four are those outlined on the green pages, identified it certain service by service. It's on these figures which in effect any Committee reductions will be made. I have nothing further to say on the green pages. Do members have any questions? Okay, does anybody Before, before you go on, you say that the twenty thousand can't be rep replicated in income registration column, does that show, how would show in here then? It doesn't show, it doesn't show in here, no. If the registration service was erm, asked to ma to reduce its budgets for ninety four, five and future years, by twenty thousand, it could do it in to three, four, five because it would bring forward twenty thousand pounds worth of carry forwards. However in five, six, its net expenditure would reduce to erm, two hundred and twelve thousand pounds. And from what County Secretary's just said, we would be unable to identify reductions in statutory service to live within that cash and The salmon pages then Chair, are those items which have been put forward to achieve the guidelines set by Policy and Resources Committee. In additions, I would remind members of the request from Policy and Resources to try and identify wherever possible further savings, in aid of the six hundred and seventy one thousand pound gap which currently exists between budget proposals and the expected figures. Any, yes Mr A couple of comments on that Chair, the first one, on the reduction in carry forwards, my understanding is that, in fact it's quite amusing in some ways, because this, this is something I was accused of as Chair of Resources Management during my year. Er, what in fact this Committee is doing, is saying that at one of the sections that makes up part of it, you happen to have carry forwards spare from last year, therefore use them because we can't identify anything else in budget savings for this, next year. Erm, that isn't necessarily the same as saying by the way your section will have to repeat that saving in future years. I think it's quite legitimate for this Committee to take that twenty thousand because it's there, and to say to itself, post budget we will have to look at the whole of the areas covered by budget protection to find the replicated twenty thousands in future years, and not just expect it to come from registration. Erm, from the comments from the table that seems to be generally agreed. Yet the point, it's a question really, which refers back to the last programme summary three, of the, the ninety four, ninety five base budget. Within that we're, we identified a gross expenditure and a gross income across all areas of the Committee's work. Now clearly some of those are, are outside our direct control. Nevertheless there's five hundred and fourteen thousand as our income that the Fire and Rescue Service, the Fire Training Unit, from the Trading Standards Department, and from Emergency Planning. My question is, has the P A G looked at any ways of increasing any of that income to any degree at all? And if so, what were their findings? We have reviewed charges on, and the Fire Service, erm, in the past, and, and we've increased certain erm, but we didn't see any way we could, we could increase any more at that time. So far as Trading Standards is concerned Chairman, the major income are weights and measures testing fees and they are set down by LACOTS, that's Local Authority Courts on Trad on Trading Standards on er, an agreed scale, so we charge exactly the same as other authorities, for the same, for the same work, and we increase the fees every year, er, in line with erm, the recommendation. Er, the amount that we get, get in depends on erm, the amounts of trade and industry. We've done relatively well in the past couple of years because we've had a lot of petrol pumps, because of the new, the opening of the big supermar the, the supermarkets where there's thirty, forty pumps go going, we make a fair bit of money in that way. But you can't guarantee that, er, and once the supermarket developments er, have gone, then you'll drop off down, down again, and again you're affected by the rece recession, whereas people won't replace things like weighbridges, er, automatic weighing machines that sort of thing during the recession, if you come out of recession, then you might get, and you say you might get some increase in fees in that, that area. But those are always considered er, during the erm, er, revised estimates time in any way. The other one and that erm, the major source of income are court, court costs, and again that depends on the cases you're taking, it depends on the, on the amount awarded by er, magistrates. Over the years, we've taken the risk to increase the court's costs, erm, where we've got agreed pro er, principles, and we've b we've been able to go to the courts and they've agreed with us, for instance, standard fees for overloaded vehicle cases, we charge seventy pounds a time. Er, and the courts by and large agree to erm, give us the seventy pounds out ev every time, but even so, even if we get the award of the costs, then the difficulty is, is, is in getting those costs in. Erm, it's up to the magistrate's clerk and sometimes the first So it's in the Fire Service that we've actually got time posted, and in fact most of the things that we wish to charge for we're actually statutorily prohibited from doing. Things like false alarm calls and so on, have been through the courts and we've been stopped from doing that. We charge the highest rate in the country for issuing fire certificates which is one of the few things which we're actually allowed to charge, and we charge more than virtually any other authority in this country. The trouble about that is, it's now enforced upon us and that's official target, we have to set priority of fire certificates because we need the money, bluntly, otherwise we have to find it elsewhere, so we give them a priority that they wouldn't otherwise have. Er, in terms of training, commercial training and it's not just the Fire and Rescue Service I spoke recently with the Chief Ambulance Officer, who's experiencing the same problems. Training's the first thing that goes, in a recession, that's the first thing that people cut, and not only, well we are achieving the fixed amount of income that we're obliged to in order to make previous reductions, but we're certainly not covering costs. So what you're effectively doing at the moment is subsidizing the private commercial sector. Erm, everything else we've looked at, there are either statutory problems or other problems that prevent us from charging. So it's, if further income generation is limited, it's through external circumstances rather than any internal increases. So we've really, we've really no alternative but to accept the hostage three, one to three on the reductions. It's best as I see it. Erm, salmon paper. We, we've got not alternative, did you say? Well I, I think that that's exactly what the Committee was saying to the Minister there. No, no. We, we, I thought were all saying that we felt that these reductions were actually unacceptable, or totally un almost unacceptable. Erm, there's not a word that's suitable to use actually in this case because we find that they would actually impact upon the service in a serious manner and therefore we don't, Well put it this way, if we were compelled to find the savings they ask, that is the only way we could do it. That's right, we need to put that rider on, that, that we would hope that, obviously would look favourably at er, erm, removing these restrictions on our service if at all possible. It's only specific in item two. Specifically in item two, yes, sorry. Yes, yes, yes. Chair, Sorry, one and three I, I, I think that we've, I, I certainly couldn't accept. We've got to accept the implication of, of item three though, in future years. I think, I think Council is accepting this but I think it's You're changing battle ground there Mr Chairman, to be honest. I think what Mr has said, is quite right, is that this is a carry forward for this year, and er, we've, we're clobbering it taking it up really is what we're saying. So what he's saying we've got to discount it So what he's saying is Next year we wouldn't have a, erm, look and see whether that twenty thousand is coming from the local authority, it's not necessarily in that particular money It's not our calls So what we're saying, or in item, well the last item, implication of further service reduction, with that twenty thousand pound on Fire and Rescue Service will be applicable for this year only? We've said that will be acceptable in P A G Chairman? It's not acceptable, it's not acceptable Chairman, we agreed in the P A G, it wasn't acceptable. It's been spelt out. We threw that one out then. Mm, yes. No way. But it's in, but it's in here isn't it? So we put a, as a rider on, that it had already passed the rider it says there, but we found it unacceptable at P A G. for we're offering them If it has to be found that's the only way. But to us it is unacceptable. Is the exception applied to two? Yes, So we've got to in Trading Standards? Yes, yes, yes. Trading Standards however important, and Trading Standards is very important, erm, when you're getting down to erm, reductions in equipment and uniforms and men, then lives are at risk, it is really a matter of er, er, of, of for our fire fighters that they have the right equipment and the right uniform and when it actually comes down, you can't compare that to maybe reductions in Trading Standards. If, if I can support that Chairman, and what John said also. That's why we couldn't, when we talked about it earlier, use the same word unacceptable, on both item two under Fire Service reductions. Because the Fire and Rescue Service reductions are unacceptable, and I think this Committee should say to, and to leave that in its proposal to Policy Panel and P and R. What things? But when it comes to the Trading Standards Board, what we're saying is, if P and R and Policy Panel this Committee finds seventy thousand pounds' worth of savings, then clearly item two represents a way of doing it. But it represents a way of doing it which is not what the members of this Committee, of all three parties I suspect, want to do. And we would therefore strongly urge them to consider that, and not to take that saving unless it was sort of necessary. Okay. Sounds reasonable to me. Are you all in favour of that then? Yes, as long as this possibly isn't major that we do not agree on? Well the Chairman Are we? So we're all in favour? Yes Right. Capital programme Chair, is that outlined in erm, on the pink pages, if members have any comments to put to David Aha It's er, courtesy, common courtesy. yes, and not going out to find your own knowledge really. You reach a point where you're not certain, then be big enough to say, I don't know, but I can phone our man who does. Absolutely, absolutely no problem. Right, let's get Can you park at the back? Carol, or not? N , er, no, probably no, because we've just, we've just got, we've got three spots, which are ta , are taken most of the week you see, so it's just a bit yes. It's only a very short walk down, if you walk through the shops you don't have to go all the way down, you can actually come, just walk past that shop and go down the middle, and you come out through the car park . Are we ready? Smokers? I've never been on tour, but I've been to the visitor's centre, and Yes. Erm, on page eleven, there's a chart where Because you can all get these things like Guy Fawkes for, but also transcripts for. Welcome to the last session of the day. Yes, er, and we're looking at living assurance. yes Can I explain all those booklets that I've put out on the table? First of all, there's two booklets here, one's a Covermaster and one's for living assurance, which has got your questions answered at the bottom. It's very good for revision, because it's the type of thing your clients are going to be asking you, and it's the type of thing we're going to be asking you tomorrow. So it's a nice way of revising tonight. It's similar to C V T, you really haven't got any notes technically today, so it, it's nice, erm, booklet to use. There's also the living assurance one the same with questions answered. I've also given you a living assurance rate book, because we'll be looking at both the rate books in a minute. And the living assurance, the guide to er, the illnesses that are covered. The critical illness, just a very brief guide there. I think we'll need a box. And a pen, one of those each. One of those each, and finally erm, a circular put out by Abbey entitled Women at Risk, which we'll be talking about. yes Right, so yo , you watched er, Dr. Marius Bernard, erm, the South African, what did you think about the message that came across in the film? What did you think about critical illness assurance? The importance of insurance. It's a very powerful message isn't it? I mean think er, life assurance erm, obviously it's the to have fails, but if somebody is eligible for, and can afford living assurance, it's got to be a brilliant product. I would think there must be a large part of people out there that could benefit from their estates isn't there? I'm, I'm never You're absolutely right, Philip. O K Sue? Can you carry on your domestic discussion tonight, yes? Erm, yes, you're absolutely right. Let me tell you a little bit about the history. Er, when we introduced Covermaster, erm, thirteen years ago or so now, it was a unique plan. It was actually plagiarised by sixteen other life companies within the first six months. It was copied. One company still calls their whole of life protection plan Mastercover,, that's an idea of how much they copied it Erm, but of course, very quickly things moved on. Other contracts were available. Er,b , but we were the first company, back in, I think 1987, to bring out living insurance. It was the first company to actually insure against critical illnesses. It had been done before of course. South Africa in the mid-eighties, it was er, common in the States. But we're the first major company in Britain, so our is second to none, our experience with the contract is second to none. It's very, very powerful. You need living assurance because you're not going to die, you need living assurance because you're not going to die. When you look at er, the critical illnesses that are covered, heart attacks, cancer, stroke, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. I mean is there anybody here, who honestly can't think of anybody who they know, I mean, perhaps if I try and rephrase that, is there anybody here who cannot think of somebody who's suffered an illness that fits into that critical illness er, category. I mean we must all know somebody who's had a heart attack, a stroke, cancer etcetera, etcetera. So we, we understand the implications, and to the money to actually put your life to right, is an absolutely wonderful contract. I said we've got er, the best claims experience, I've given you the one pamphlet, Women at Risk, which points out, women used to say, oh, a stroke it won't happen to me, cancer it won't happen to me. But that is quite useful to show what we've already paid out to women, We, we've got, three over there. Have you got that one somewhere? Yes, Have you already got those? No There erm, somewhere along the line, right. I'll, I'll get you some in a minute, er, I'll carry on if er, if er, you don't mind I've got, oh here we are, I fo , I hadn't given them out sorry. Thank you. So that's very useful to show you how women have been affected but this is on our claims experience. Erm, if you turn over the page it says seventy eight percent of female claims have been on the diagnosis of cancer, and it gives you a breakdown of the condition and the age when diagnosed. All very powerful. A pamphlet that is equally powerful is one called Abbey's Number One for Claims Experience, but unfortunately we don't have any other copies at the moment, so I will leave one on the side so you can look at it. But do ask when you get back to the branch, because it samples claims that Abbey has, have had, erm, it reiterates the statistics that you've just heard, the likelihood of somebody suffering with cancer, heart attacks, strokes etcetera, it er, gives you the ages er, if you choose, write in statistics, the one you've been listening to. Current age, twenty five, the likelihood of somebody having a heart attack or developing cancer before sixty five, heart attack one in ten males, one in thirty nine females, cancer one in ten males, one in ten females. It's, it's horrendous those statistics when you think about it. If we can help people in those circumstances it's got to be a brilliant product. What, what was that leaflet called please? It's Abbey Number One, Abbey, Abbey Life is Number One for Claims, because we were the first company er, if I put it over there now, it will stop me collecting it and taking in out. They are available as I say, but at the moment our's are being updated. So it's an absolutely brilliant product. Now,, if we consider ordinary life assurance, somebody first said to me that er, maybe the best erm, sales manager, or sales promoter or publicist or, or whatever, was the person who actually had the idea of calling death insurance, life insurance, yes? How could you fancy ringing up your potential clients, and say, Hello, it's Carol, I'm calling from Abbey Death. it doesn't sound too good does it? But that's what it is isn't it? Ordinary life assurance really means death insurance. What happens if, let's have a look, and compare it with critical illness. On death, the premiums cease, the sum assured is paid on the living assurance or the Covermaster Plan, living expense is reduced, the widow could work or remarry, a potential answers. Critical illness, you've got carry on paying the premiums, with no lump sum paid on living assur , er, on life assurance, the living expenses are likely to increase, because you may have er, somebody who's disabled, paralysed or whatever, there's no chance of the widow returning to work because she's looking after person who's er, ill, and obviously she can't remarry because she's not widowed at this point. So if you compare critical illness and death with what happens at the time, and I've got to ask you this. What carries you away? Well on death, obviously a car first carries you away, if you're ill it's an ambulance. And one simple statement, which do you see the most of when you're travelling around? How many hearses, how many ambulances do you see? Ambulances. Yes, how many They take them away at night in Telford, so you only see them So it's a brilliant product and there's got to be a need for it. You don't have to die. This year, almost a quarter of million people were known to have cancer. A hundred thousand will still be alive five years later. A lump sum, we won't ask for it back, and maybe it's been useful for them to adapt their lives in the meantime. Brilliant concept. What I want to do though is, is go through the plan, highlighting the differences. It was based on the Covermaster Plan with added extras. So I don't want to go through all the things that are the same, I want to highlight the differences, and maybe it'll help you in your mind to distinguish between the two products as regards examination and the questionnaire tomorrow. First of all with living assurance it's a whole of life plan that pays on, well we know it pays out on death, and we know it pays out on serious illness, but after that, the pay-out is obviously vast compared with Covermaster. Permanent disability, major organ transplant, paralysis, multiple sclerosis, blindness, terminal illness, and loss of limbs. All of which we have in this brochure defined for us. Now one of the areas we can get involved in when we're talking to our clients is well what do they mean by cancer? Does it count as all cancer, what's a definition of a heart attack. This is quite useful for you to refer to, this booklet, but do please tell your clients you're not a doctor, it's very much up to the client's doctor and our medical underwriters, as to whether we pay out or not. This is just a guide, but a very useful guide. Er, for example, we're talking about a heart attack damage to heart muscle, we're talking about strokes where there's a loss fl ,bl , sorry, the flow of blood to the brain, erm, we're talking about cancer, we're talking about an abnormal growth of cells, but not all cancers are covered, a skin cancer which isn't life threatening, isn't covered, erm, as a result of perhaps too much sunbathing etcetera, whereas a melanoma, a cancer that comes into er, a great lump on the skin which can be life-threatening, obviously is. So you have to sort of look carefully. The definitions are here, erm, loss of limbs, yes? Paralysis, when a limb is paralysed there is complete loss of movement and feeling, if you're talking about paralysis, loss of limbs, we're talking about the severance, would you believe, of any two limbs. Would you tell people if it was from above erm, the elbow or above the knee? And also it would . And also? Erm, actually there was a mix-up with that yesterday, we were told one limb, One or more limbs Two Two limbs, Two Two limbs, two limbs, for loss of limb, yes, yes. yes So what I'm saying to you is if you like to refer to this, this will give you the clear definition of what, what's covered in each case. Who can have this plan? Well, the key point there is there's no joint life, last claim. You can write it own life, joint life first claim, or life of another, but you can't l , write it joint life, last claim. Why not, David? Well erm,well probably because it's not going to benefit the person. Absolutely, does it make sense for, for husband and wife over there to wait for the second one to have a heart attack, or the second one to have a cancer before it pays out, Come on It really doesn't make sense does it? What was that Gerald? I said, come on have a heart attack. come and have a heart attack So it doesn't make sense, and obviously it isn't er, written joint life, last claim. Sorry, can I just ask a question there? Certainly. In the question of no joint life, last claim, mhm Right,I've forgotten what I was going to ask now, no it's alright, I was thinking about the circumstances, I was thinking about er, er, a dependent left behind you,sorry. Yes, you, you've sorted it in your own mind? Yes, yes. Good, minimum premiums are the same, twenty pounds and two hundred, but do remember that existing clients, could have a reduced minimum premium of sixteen pounds or a hundred and sixty. What do we mean by an existing client, Shirley? A client that's already got some insurance. Absolutely, and they can actually retain that policy with you that evening. It doesn't have to be one that's issued. So if you start thinking about our client that we've previously erm, who we identified wanted fifty seven thousand pounds worth of life cover, I believe. Maybe the solution would be to put some of that in living assurance, and some of it in Covermaster. Whatever, if we're writing two policies, he can be classed as an existing client, so we could have a reduced minimum. However, do we talk minimum premiums to our clients. No If you tell somebody you can it for as little as sixteen pounds per month, guess what, that what they'll have. If you tell them that to get exactly what they need it's going to cost them thirty pounds a month, and isn't it a brilliant contract, they'll probably have that. O K, let's move on to maximum benefit. What's the maximum benefit on a Covermaster Plan? Five hundred thousand pounds. Five million Five million, or if, five million, we might do a little bit of reinsuring on that one, don't quote me. Erm, the maximum benefit on living assurance is the figure that Janet come up with just, half a million, five hundred thousand. That's actually on all critical illness cover plans, because if they've got a living assurance, or they've got some other plan that's got critical illness benefit, it's the total maximum that Abbey will insure them for, for critical illness, for heart attacks, stroke etcetera. And includes Keyman cover. It includes Keyman cover. This is an interesting statement. If somebody has er, life cover, and living insurance is over a hundred thousand, they will be subject to the need being established. Whatever does that mean? They've got to prove that they actually need that much cover. Right, so how are they going to prove it? Well by showing that their dependents will need that sort of income to come in. Income, we're looking at income. We're looking at financial underwriting. Anything above a hundred thousand, and we're looking at financial underwriting, we're looking at basically four times salary. So if we've got somebody earning nine thousand, they're going to want to know why they're insuring themselves for a hundred thousand on living insurance benefit. O K, so financial underwriting, is on a hundred thousand and above, you look at four times salary. Erm,Right, erm, we get this thorny question now about how to establish how much somebody needs for living assurance. If we just go back to the plan in the future, erm, and we move down to this section here, let's look at the questions we're asking. If you were to become critically ill or disabled, would you like some or all of your life assurance capital sum to be paid to you immediately, if so, how much? Now that's a difficult question to ask people, yes? How much would you like in the event of a heart attack or a stroke, it's very difficult for them to decide. Erm, what type of things do you think would actually affect that decision? Size of the mortgage. Size of the mortgage, that could well be the first point of call isn't it? Which most of us will have a mortgage protected against death, I E, the sum assured is released to repay the loan, what happens if we get a critical illness, heart attack, stroke, etcetera, and can't work. You're still going to have problems repaying your mortgage. So ideally, the size of the mortgage is a good starting point. What other things do you think we could use to determine how much? Erm, If they'll need special care. Yes, but lo , but then we've so , we've got to pre-judge a little bit then, as to what illness they're going to have, and that gets a bit difficult. But you're right, we're, we're taking into account extra costs. Age and , sorry Talk about That's O K, it's about the children Er, Carry on, you go then If the children are er, privately educated, and it's high, high expenses that you would want to carry on with. It might well be something that is very important to you to maintain, even if you can't carry on working through illness. Absolutely right. Age, because you might be considering well, er, if something happens dramatically, at say fifty, fifty two, or something like that, you might just go and retire, so you would be set up in that respect. So how would you determine how much you need? How much the sum assured would be Erm , well by virtue I suppose really, of your operating need, if you like, your, your yearly operating expenses. Yes, you're, you're approaching it from er, a similar method to Sue over there, you're saying how much would I need to, to survive and you're talking small businessmen really, aren't you? In that effect, yes, yes? Sort of, yes. You could be police that there's a a juvenile or what looks like to be a juvenile, sleeping in in part of the flats but where it's a a stairwell, an ou outhouse, erm even under the stairs, then they'll come along and check it out. Nine out of ten it's a runaway. And they'll just, they'll eit you know, just hand it over to the police and that's as far as we'll go. Mm. Erm erm when you're patrolling the flats erm have you ever come erm into any sort of physical danger yourself? You and your your patrol? No but erm I've had one or two people swear up to us. Er I had or trying to provoke us, and erm what our lads have been informed is rather than take a situation on like that, it's better just to turn around and walk away. If they call you names or they spit at you, or or whatever, it's better to walk away and live another day than to get your head kicked in and end up in hospital. Erm y you get a lot of well we did get a lot of verbal abuse from the young the youngsters. But there again you you just let it go in one ear and out the other ear. That's why you've got to have somebody who's a mature natured person, for this for this k kind of job. You know probably if you got a younger person, he probably would have been after him, square up to him, and erm . Cos if you ever squared up to one of these or anybody in the flats, people'd just come out of the out of the woodwork. And as far as as er physical threats, what, somebody actually being hit? No. I mean you read you read a lot in the press erm about people being mugged on the flats and er break-ins and all this sort of thing. Are they actually as bad as the press makes out, the flats? Well before we came on the flats I would imagine they was. But now we're on the flats, no. There again, how long does it take to mug a person? Ten, fifteen seconds. And you can do a lot in fifteen seconds, you could murder somebody in fifteen seconds. Erm nobody's gonna mug a person if they see us coming, or if they see a bobby coming. Nine out of ten they'll wait until we've gone passed, or even the police have gone passed, before they'll commit an offence. But since we've been on the flats, there's probably been half a dozen muggings. Some in the daytimes, some at night. But there again, it's people walking through the flats, who don't live on the flats, that get mugged. Erm or people attending the blues, walking from one end to the other. You know people who's coming in from o the outside to come on to the flats, they're the people at risk. Erm but er we've had one or two people come to us, and report that they've been mugged, there again we get straight on the phone to the police. And let them them deal with it. We we'll do the reporting and that's that's as far as we'll go. But if we there again if we see somebody that's being mugged, and we think that we can assist, or we can deal with it, then we will, you have to take every situation as it comes. Y erm it's like you don't go running up to something if you're gonna come worse off. If there's half a dozen of them and there's two of you, and there's one person being mugged, erm then it's better to to stand on and watch, and report b back to the base here, who can inform the police, who can get the necessary assistance out to deal with it. And er that's what we do. Erm how do you think the people in the flats erm look at er you patrolling them? Well I think they're helping us erm possibly if this system had been started a few years ago, then possibly flats complex, wouldn't have got the bad reputation it has today. Because I go home and I people say, Oh where are you working? I will say, Oh I'm doing a job at flats. And, Oh! flats like then. as if you walk round with a shotgun armoured tank. And I say, No it's a quite pleasant place to work. And they say, Ah come off it, we've heard about it, we've read it in the papers. one small aspect in the paper of , can into a page a full page. But whereas say something that happens say Well say take for example where I live in . Er somebody being attacked there might make a paragraph. It's it's it's er quietened down, and people do accept us. And people have stopped us and have said, If this i if you'd have been on on the flats, say six, ten years ago, erm it wouldn't have got the reputation it has now. Because the senior members on the flats that have been living here since it was put up, when they came to live on complex, they reckoned it was the place to come and live. And they was proud to come and live in it. But er things have deteriorated. Till we've got the situation we've got now. Do you erm have you got to know people a bit on the flats? We we we know one or two people erm more or less by face, not by name. Er there was quite a few people moved out now. There was a a an old lady down we talked to, she's out most nights. There's one or two people knocking around that'll talk to you. Erm we more or less know the young the young thug element as such. Er and they seem to stay well clear of us when they see us walking round. Yes we know quite a few. In those areas. you said you got quite a good rapport. Well I think we have now. Yes. Er without having a good relationship with the people in the flats, er if I mean some people if they say see something going off, they'll turn their you know, turn their back and they don't want to know. There again, on the other hand, if some one or two other people see something going off, they'll come and tell us. As I've said before, we can't be all over the flats at the same time. So we rely on, to a certain degree, on a bit of help from the tenants. Now, how do you patrol the flats? Erm do you go out in teams? Well at the moment we've just started a new patrol programme and er we two two sergeants wal patrolling the the walkways. And I had one sergeant downstairs patrolling the er street level. Er The sergeant downstairs, if he sees any trouble or he finds something that's going off or bumps into something, then he can radio back into base again. And then we can take appropriate action from there. Erm the two lads on the flats, there's two of them together, so that anything that they they meet or come up against, they can handle themselves. But in our time, it's very quiet now so we've we've moved into a different routine again, where I have two two sergeants out at one time, changing over er frequently so they don't get bored. Is it is there not that much to do now in the flats? Well yeah there there's a there's a lot to do, erm with half the flats being empty and Or say two thirds of the flats being empty. Erm you've got quite a few people walking through. Erm these people are possibly the element we don't want on the flats. Cos they're walking through the area and they'll if they've had a few pints , Let's go down Oh we'll walk through Flats and we'll smash one or two lights up, smash one or two windows. Erm I wouldn't say it's it's gone quiet at night, we've got to be more aware now anyway. Than what we had we was doing last year. As I said last year, there were quite a few people out on the walkways, so it was very rarely you got anybody walking through. Now two thirds of the residents have gone, there's a lot of walkways open, there's a lot of windows there to smash, there's a lot of you know,try setting fire setting fire. So we've got to be more aware during the like what we call the silent hours. Erm just really. Erm d now the flats are quieter, do you find there are as many blues on the flats? Well erm At the moment we've got one one blues on. Erm and that is not half as what it was last year. But then again, we can say that we've had a quiet week Saturday and Sunday, or from Friday till through till Monday morning, it can be packed out with people just visiting the blues. Do they do they seem to create much trouble, these blues? Yeah. Er as I said before, if we get some verbal abuse from people going to the blues, then we know that it was outsiders coming in. they just accept us for what we are, they know that we're not gonna upset their lifestyle, we're not gonna start raiding their place at six in the morning. They accept us for what we are, and that's it. Mm. So you've got no powers to go sort of talk about their noise,? No. If somebody comes and reports to us that erm that the music's loud, all we'll do is refer them to Road Police Station. And let them do . Erm do you have erm much to do with the housing people? That are on the flats. Yeah we've got the daily You mean the council staff? Yes. Yeah we've got the daily contact each morning with one of the, one of the er council employees, they'll come up approximately between eight and nine, and we'll hand over any incidents reports that have been made during the night. And we'll er inform them of erm the state of the flats during the night, whether it was quiet busy, erm anything we've seen knocking about, erm and things in general. So does it work quite well for them? Oh yes we've they are subscribing, and if we wasn't keeping a good erm a good liaison with them, then I don't think we'd be here now. Erm wh wh what what's it like working on Flats, I mean, have you worked anywhere similar? No I haven't worked anywhere similar, in in this employment. Er but working on Flats,taken to the job. Erm when I came on to the flats I came with an open mind and I was gonna you know take things as I as I met them. Erm we treat everybody the same, we look after everybody as I say, the best we can. Erm and it's just a normal job. Yes t to a certain extent, I expect. Erm there's nothing hard about it, there's nothing easy about it. Erm the best thing about this job is, you don't know what's round the corner. As I say one day it might be quiet, and the next day, something might happen. Erm since we've we've worked the flats I think, the the lads who've worked up here have dealt with a a very broad erm a very broad aspect of incidence. And th they will they will have dealt with more incidents up here than I would imagine any other erm place of employment that they'll go to. And it probably beds them in slightly to go off to somewhere else. Is there anything you haven't worked with on the flats yet? Well we haven't had a murder, and we haven't ha a rape. And er erm that's about it I think. But er who knows we're probably here for another two years, we might find a dead body somewhere. Erm it's a bit frightening when you if you find somebody dossing down somewhere. You can see a body and like, Oh what's that? and then you you know, you're a little bit er relieved when it moves. . Or it stands up or you know you you go and put it in the cupboard, and all of a sudden there's a there's a there's a face looking at you, you know. Yeah, you're hoping Your heart er beats rising. I think personally erm I mean yo would you like to live on the flats? No there's no gardens. Of such. Erm the tenants are not allowed to keep animals. But er as you know looking round the flats, they do. Erm and I But there again, if it was a controlled access to the flats, and people wasn't allowed to wander through the flats. Er probably yes. Erm but then again, if anybody's got any kiddies, which I have, it's not it's not a Well I don't reckon it it is a place to bring children up in. Erm if there was probably me and me wife on me own, and it was a co controlled access, and there weren't people walking through,probably come and live here. What do you mean by controlled access? Well er if take it as if threw a b a fence all the way round the the flats. Well that this starts off by keeping the outsiders out. They do most of the damage, knocking on doors, daub writing all over the place. So what I mean by controlled access is nobody comes on i within to this flat complex, without er the se the security team knowing. So say for example you was a tradesman. And you was say I'm going to come to the exit point, I'm going to say come in here. And unless has told us that you're coming, then you don't get on the flats. That's one way to keep traders out. I mean how many times has somebody knocked on your door, Oh I'm Joe Bloggs I've come to sell dusters? You know,. And people don't want it. Er it's like kids or people walking through from Road to Road. They'll ni they'll nip through the flats. They'll deposit their rubbish, you know. If they've had a few beers, they m they may leave something else behind. People don't want it. Erm and that's what I mean by access. Controlled access. Erm aren't complexes, in my view in my view only, in complexes of this size, it should be a controlled access. And er you just don't get bad people wandering round the flats. The only people you get on the flats, is the people who live on the flats, and the people who's been invited into the flats. Erm and that's that's my view. And that's right down here. Wh what what's this ? And this is all sealed up as well is it? Yeah it's all sealed up. All these doors. We used to have a a dosser here. Yeah. Frightened the living daylights out of him when I opened the cupboard. You say you don't get any trouble on No no. See it's all nailed up now. I opened it one morning, there was somebody looking at me . You were saying about blues at er night. Is that weekends is it? Er you get what what you call a small blues during the week, but Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, you can expect er large blues. Is that on the flats or is it the . Well you got one on the , which has got nothing to do with us. Then you've got one on Walk. Let's have a look round here, check this. Yeah. So what they're doing now, is sealing the walkways off. It's a bit of a So you can't get through. It's a bit of a pain in the neck, cos we can't walk round you see. the whole walk's been sealed off? Yeah the whole walkway's been sealed off. Which one's that, is that the ? It's erm d der I think. And after fourteen months up here I can still get lost. Yeah. and whereas before we could walk round in a on a circular route, Yeah that's Walk. So you have to you're just doubling back on yourselves . Yeah just d doubling back on ourselves. But erm er when the W Winter comes on, the wind starts whistling round this place, it er cuts into your ears a bit. You can feel the cold. You not have any any trouble with vagrants on these empties? Well we've had one or two, as I say, I found a chap in number fifteen, the outhouse, I just asked him to move on. Er next night so I frightened him, I was gonna nail it up while he was inside, and he soon come out . You've not had anybody tear the tin down and No well not as far we've we've found. Er nobody tearing the tin down. . You'd you'd probably come in the daytime, and you'd find some of the tin's been ripped off a bit, you might find a find a corner's been ripped off. And then you know, when you check up on it, the following day, you probably find the council's been back in and forgot to secure it, so we've got s a nail and some nails and a hammer, and we'll er just re-secure it and let the the council know in the morning. Walk, completely empty. It's all this one side of the flats isn't it ? Yes it's all this side, er phase er one, two and three. How do you find it on the parts that are still populated, I mean the Well they're more or less no different to what we're walking down here now. You might see somebody scurrying about later at night or in the morning. It's not very lively? No. No. Creeping off to work. It's the main problem we get to face in the daytime now, is the windows being smashed. And obviously you can er ascertain that er, when more windows get smashed, the locals are gonna start complaining to the council, that it looks a bit of an eyesore, even though it's an eyesore now, it'll be a greater eyes eyesore then. But we're not on the flats in the daytime, Yeah. So there's nothing we can do about it. And most of that goes on in the daytime Mm. does it? And this is Walk. Walk yeah. Number six is the loos. You can walk down here,don't walk down here at nighttime if it's er if it's chock-a-block. Alright then. The lady lives over the blues must have a set of earphones somewhere. And she's got three kiddies so she moves out at nighttime. Yeah we don't erm antagonize them. If we see there's quite a few on the walkways, and if we know that they're outsiders then we'll we'll turn round and we'll walk back the other way. It's better to walk b back, and look at them for a d you know, from afar, than Yeah. try and push your way through. On to. There's a cupboard there that's been ripped open, I mean is that just part of the vandalism that goes on? Well no, knowing our it's probably the er electricity board's come along, to read the meter, somebody's put a screw in it, and they've got a crowbar and just opened it up. That's not vandalism. No. No. He cleaned it up a bit and a scrap yard and it, and this thing and they were like hills and rock gardens, you know like Oh really! hundreds of yards long Yeah. and and deep! Yeah. This bloke, you know, had been working on it for fifty years nonstop and Oh my god! Yeah, Sue Sue wants it o over a weekend don't you? Just give up! I can't, I just wanna sort of look out the window and it's changed completely! Not asking a lot now is it? Oh it's great! Ah! the old boy . Yeah. Ah yeah. Yeah. And they build up the old . Yeah and you don't even notice it do you? So these cupboards have gotta go on here but the door's gotta go up in the meantime? Yep. Yep. Oh right. ,. We've still we've still got a little bit of fiddling Oh I see to do with the what the well we've got instead of all these individual prints I've got I've got long ones cos if the Yeah. floor is Mm. very uneven. I'm gonna fit them. But until you finish the your messing around you're better to leave the doors off aren't you? What you gonna do on the floor? Well we're looking at we were having a look this morning at erm that vinyl floor covering stuff Mm. Mm. would be best. Do you want to see if there's some wallpaper in here Mark? ! No! It's er that that we're particularly Ah that's er lovely keen on. isn't it? Yeah! Got a real sort of er But it's gonna be difficult to decorate around it, you know, and keep it intact but we'll we'll try it. That's amazing isn't it ? How people Yeah. with chi , er tastes are different? Are you gonna keep this, keep this as well are you? I'm sure it was at one time. Gotta be, but carpet, I mean that was ! Yeah. I think the door's nice though! The thing about this is , it's gonna be a nice room isn't it, when the Well quite! Yeah. you know, the garden is done. Got a decent so you're gonna have this as a dining room are you? Well I I I don't know. Well that might just be you know, like another sitting room It's Yeah. tasteful innit? so Yeah I mean Yeah I Lovely! mean Yeah, don't don't, try not to damage any more of it, I mean No , no I really think of that. Are you gonna be able to get some more from the manufacturer to to patch that bit up are you? Patch that together, yeah! . Yeah! And we'll have another fire in here. What was that, an old Yeah and a gas fire thingy was it? Yeah. Yeah. Mm. If we could get a you know, if we could open that up cos we got one of tho th , have you seen the fire in action? In the lounge? Yeah Yeah. I like it. Yeah , yeah got a glimpse Yeah. of that. I like it. Oh . Oh it is, and we put, light the fires Nice and warm. as well. Yes, it is nice and warm actually but That's actually gas isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Derek was saying about it. Gives off quite a lot of heat. And I think they're quite expensive to run but it was so nice we We got rid of that one. we thought we'd try it out. Well the new one was the new one was we looked at one in the gas showroom when this Alright! thing came out Mm. What's the matter? What's the matter? Mm. You're not tape to taping are you ? No I'm not actually I've rewound it once. Can't work out how Mark, we'd like to but we can't work out how! Well you just shove one aerial output th the aerial input on the other one I think. Mm. Or video, no, video No I like it, this one's nice output to video input. I like this. Yeah. Yeah, it's nice that! You've got It's convenient isn't it? That's right, very Switch it on and you can What's that? The thermostat, I'm just wondering how it works Yeah, we know about the thermostats. cos there's another thermostat on the on the boiler itself. Tell me the difference between a volt meter and an amp meter? Well one measures volts and one measures amps! What's the difference between a volt and an amp? The volt is the amount of current passing through Yeah. yeah? An amp amps is current, and volts is volts ! Well basically with a with a volt meter Volt Right? you put the the volt meter across the voltage you're measuring say, like a battery, right Right. got a battery, put the volt Right. across it Yeah. and you measure volts, okay? Yeah, they're fine That tells you how much,wha what sort of voltage battery you need does it? Well that tells you the voltage of the battery at that particular That you're using? time, yeah? I understand. Right. So But an amp meter amp meter you put in series say, like if you put a light bulb across Right. the battery you put one lead on the battery for the light bulb and then the other The other one lead of the bulb would go through through the meter. Right, to the Does that ma bulb? So it'd go from the, from the battery And Mark's gone past! Are we there? Are we there? Are we there? And If we go from the battery to the bulb , from the bulb to the meter To the amp meter, from the meter to the battery from the meter to the battery , yeah. Right. And what does that do? And that measures current. And that measures the amount of current flow to , when did you pick it up? Oh! Well we had it, got it last night. Did you? Yeah. Why's that then? Is that something you're teaching the kids are you? We are we we've got an amp meter and a volt meter and I thought they were the same thing you see. No. You've gotta be a bit careful cos if you stick an amp meter or a current meter across a battery you're effectively shorting the battery out. Right. Right? Cos you've effectively got a dead short through an ammeter whereas a a volt meter's got a a hun , a high er resistance or an open circuit, effectively. Right. So if I put a volt meter on a battery it would short the battery? That's what you said isn't No. it? Amp meter across the battery. If you put an amp meter across a battery? Yeah. But the current would flow wouldn't it? Yeah, the current would flow Yeah. but you would get a lot of current flowing. Depends what the what the a , I mean if you've got an ammeter set to milliamps and you stuck it across a battery Right. the meter would go smack across the thing! Right. But if you have it set to to amps Amps. then you'd probably get, well whatever the battery's capable of . But the first time he's hitting it See what I mean? it bloody hard ! So you've gotta be a bit careful! Well why on earth would a school have an And amp meter for? all these buttons like the normal I mean, I understand why a volt me , you know, I mean, but I mean, battery's have ? has a voltage written on . anyway! I mean, so what do you want a Yeah. volt meter for? Well when they I'm going to look at being funny. Yeah. Oh I'll be out in a minute. Erm if you the thing is,yo a battery might be marked nine volts Right. but when it's dead, it might only have six on it, six volts. Left? Well if it's dead, it's dead isn't it? Yeah, well it's dead yeah but what happens is, when it dies the volts go down, that's why the the yo your radio or whatever got it's operating and stops working. Know what I mean? So if it, if it's got six volts left, it wouldn't be dead would it? It would just be Yeah, it'd be dead. Would it? Yeah. Right. So what's the point of having a volt meter then? Just to find out what voltage you got left in your battery? Well no, your volt me , I use volt meters all the time at work. You make, build a circuit if you Right wanna test the power supplies you put a volt meter across to measure cos if you think So the power is going round? No, that's Well they an amp meter! You just wanna measure the volt, it's just a test meter isn't it? I mean, you get meters normally, the meters we've got at work and you just turn a knob and it's got ohms, volts, amps frequency you know, whatever. And they get them on one machine? Yeah. I mean, you can use a volt meter as an amp meter if you put a shunt across it. Right. See what I mean. Oh well at least I know that there is a, a different thing. It's all, it's all to do with ohms law, if you know ohms law then you'll understand I don't know ohms law. what's what. No. I mean I think really new, newfangled things! It's really not this . Oh it came yesterday did it? Oh she's sitting in it already. I don't know, he's got the key but he's not gonna get in. Oh. Yeah. I'll have a quick shake, shufty. It's very nice. Well the si , the back door's open innit? Oh is it? Yeah, so you can close it. Station please! Cor this is nice innit? First time Underneath I've been in one of these. underneath there that's your miles per gallon so as you're driving along Yeah. that tells you you know, how how you're driving it and onto Oh right! economy Yeah, yeah, got you! er been quite good in that one. Ha, so when you put your foot down the meter goes smack ! That's right. Yeah. There's your lights. Side lights. And what's, is this beam? No, that's er the rear fog light Oh right! and those are you know The beam would be on a stick wouldn't it? Yeah. It's on one of the sticks. Yeah. Yeah erm Oh it's nice isn't it? Electric windows if we go out later. Oh, sun roof as well. Oh yeah You can er adjust the lights, say that Mark's got in the back Yeah. put that on one Oh right, why? cos there's somebody in the back and that's Oh right, cos of, that changes the angle of the lights. Oh right. It changes the two Yeah, mm mm. erm and then you can control the density of the other lights. And they go down at a bit at a time or it'll go all the way down . Mm! Nifty, what? This is your mhm! Oh my god! like that. Is that for the mirrors? Yeah. Oh god! That's Do you wanna drive? Take it for a little drive. No, probably an ! I mean no, I wouldn't ! I'd take any other cars! No I wouldn't ! In any other car, I'd say it was no. Well you took your dad out didn't you? I know, but bit different. Honestly! The steering lock on? If you were to come back there Oh! all the wa , all the way starting up car We'd better get her out of here, she'll want one tomorrow! No, I wouldn't want . How long have you been waiting for this car, a while haven't you Spen? Erm Got a huge accelerator pedal innit? Just like it covers the whole of January. your foot! January we bought January, February, March, mm, that's not bad actually. So incredibly quiet! A lovely sound isn't it? Erm Mm , too right! How many valves has it got? Got sixteen valves has it? Yeah, no , twenty six. Four cylinders four Oh. . Even even with ashtray Yeah. Ah ! Ah no ! Oh that's sickly isn't it? That is really smart innit? Ah that's brilliant! How does that work then? They probably have a big No idea. whole department working on these ashtrays and then Yeah, I would of thought eighteen German engineers just Yeah. on working the ashtray . That fascinates me! Oh that's brilliant that ! No I like the light because like, as soon as as soon as you put your key in the door Yeah. the light comes on, and then it waits until you start the engine until it goes off Yeah. and then when you get out as soon as, as soon as the car comes to rest the light comes on Yeah. and then it stays on until you've closed the door and locked it, you know Yeah. then it goes out. No, there's all sorts of remote to adjust yo you think you're gonna set the clock so you have a little knob Yeah. don't you? But you don't, you've got a button to erm and you just put that . Oh god! I'm surprised it hasn't got a digital one actually. No. I don't like digital clocks No. I'd rather have it like that. For actually glancing down and looking at a clock It's nice. a Mm. dial one is is actually easier to read isn't it? Well What's sa what's the hi-fi like then? Mark . Not bad really. Just do one more when we've listened to it. The radio's pretty good. And the aerial is in is those two strips on the window. Oh yeah, yeah. Rather than an aerial. Vandal-proof job Yeah. you see. Good for vandals, yeah. There is is like a break, this vandal-proof thing, if you park in a duff area Yeah. You pull them thing out do you. Yeah. You can Oh yeah, take it Take your out. radio out and and lock it in the glove box. And they give you you get four keys and one of them is called the chauffeur's key Yeah. and that will drive the car but it won't unlock the glove box or the boot Yeah, for the chauffeur. so if you do , you don't want your chauffeur to know what you've got in the glove box A chauffeur key ! That's your job then Sue! I like these seatbelts at the back! They come from the other way Yeah, it's amazing! don't they? They go the other way to normal. Yeah. That's good actually. They say that's so that if there's an accident They can just get out innit? then people can er get you out easier. Oh course Yeah. yeah! Never thought of that. A lot of design's gone into that. Good old Gerries ah? Yeah. But it's not Yeah but this one did as well. Yeah. These floor mats see they've got little screw in things. Oh, what's the idea? Just twist the lock and they Mm! It's a bizarre amount of detail but It's got a lovely , lovely gear box hasn't it? Mm. Gear stick on that. Yeah. Nice little chunky one. Yeah, it's very nice! The Germans have certainly got it haven't they? But i , Mark you look at this accelerator pedal it's the whole sort of length of your foot, it's Mm. so comfortable instead of Mm. that piddling bit that goes in the ball of your foot. And you find you see you've got that little thing to put your clutch foot on as well. That, next to you. Is there? Oh No. god! No, go to the left. Oh I see what you mean. And there's a little Yeah, yeah a little they've even put that. They're so Yeah, well it's all for comfort I think. Yeah. They're amazing aren't they? How fast will it go then Spence, I'm sure you wound it up? No, you mustn't take it over They've tested it at a hundred and thirty five miles done, eh? You ge yo you mustn't take it over er, three and a half things or eighty miles an hour Mm. for the first six hundred miles. Mm. But the top Oh course, yeah! speed in the book is a hundred and twenty nine. Oh cos you only got it yesterday didn't you? Yeah. Mm. Mm. I don't think we'll get anywhere near a hundred and twenty nine in that ! It's not that so much though, it's just a luxury and the the quietness of the engine and everything Mm. isn't it? Mm. And Er acceleration I suppose. Yeah, it's very good it's very good like between forty to seventy, you know, for actual Mm. pulling away from lights or whatever it's not, nothing very special. The thing is when you're doing No, but I mean but when you're doing fifty and you wanna overtake something Yeah. Yeah. That's when it's very tight. It's very nice! Let's go and see my sis! Yeah, very impressive isn't it? Got a nice sound to it as well, when you're when you're not speaking. Mm. Little But it only works the horns. with the erm the ignition does it? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah we haven't tried the horn yet. Probably goes diddle di der der da diddle der der ! Ooh! Well you wouldn't argue with that would you ? Splendid, yeah! Oh yes , very nice! Very nice Spencer! Nice interior, grey, I like grey. I'm surprised you couldn't Yeah I actually and the door opens for you. Yeah, that's a bit of a let down isn't it? You've gotta ha work that handle, yes. It is really, you've gotta open the door ! Want someone to lift you out as well do you Sue? Well you know. Nice big chunky doors on it. Yes it's very good! Lovely colour! You choose the colour did you? Well I had Cor! like a blanket with bright red dark red or erm or white. It's sort of a is it a sort of bluey green? Or is it a racing green? It's called nau nautic green. Or I mean the reds and greens are a bit boring aren't they? It's Mm. different. Even though it's just a car . What the hell is that The smell? I dunno, it stinks! Phworr, Jesus! Phworr! You're meant to have a a beige upholstery with it but I think the grey would be Yeah. nice. Oh, better. Yeah, I don't really like the . Yeah very nice! If only we could. I like the cigarette bit! Don't even smoke but she likes the cigarette bit ! Ashtray! Don't smoke do we darling? Well no,. Where's your car? Oh it's just up the road. It's just, I I you know, we were there and we'd sort of gone past so rather than reverse Well no, I I just carried on cos I saw a space there, that's all. Ooh! So how come you got a filthy cold then? Everybody went last week and I got it, didn't I? Alright. Are your mum and dad alright? Yeah, they're alright, yeah, yeah! Said we leave it on the back cos we got roped into , but there we go ! So where did you stay then, there? Is it Not much No. chance of that! No I went in bed and breakfast. They know the accommodation you see and it's really grot! Oh. But it's very good! Sort of make breakfast in about half an hour, quarter of an hour. Right. So the North then? Well I'm not get a taxi from the station you know a dump! It's funny actually cos I thought this is the first Saturday when we vegged out to . Well I didn't actually expect you to be in really No. but we thought well we're going up the grave and it's not exactly out the way so we thought we'd pop in. Alright? Erm some of your clothes I didn't take with me and they're at mum's, I I mean I . To be honest, I didn't know what you were really It's lovely! I mean I didn't take a lot with me, I mean I took too much as it was and my arm carrying it across the Underground . And so the Did you go on the train rather than drive? Yeah. I mean the there's no parking at the B and B Yeah. There's no parking at the hospital, it's terrible! And er you know, it just wasn't worth it. , I should think it's good for him! Put on a bit of weight haven't you? This looks Yeah. wonderful! Mm. I thought you were supposed to go round those, not Have you seen the new Star Trek yet then? No. From I what I see advertised wha Ah that's whe Yeah. when does it come to I , is it in Ipswich then? Ipswich at the moment. Yeah. Oh right. But honestly it's make a date for next week, okay? Yeah. Did you do the Star Trek competition on Radio One? Radio Times. Or Radio One. Yeah. I can I No we did, we did the one in Radio Times didn't we? Which one? Steve Wright No. was doing it was he? No. No it was erm God innit cold again? Simon Bates. Yeah. Yeah. His cardigan's on. Er, yeah I know Have you seen it then? before he was on. Mm. Good? Is it? Best one I think. Very! Yeah. Do you still watch Is it still the old crowd? Do you watch Star Trek now? Shi , William Shatner? Mm. Really? Is it really? Good god, he must Don't like it now though without the likes of William Shatner and that. Is that the new one? Yeah. Well you'll like th th this, it's very, very well done! Extremely Oh! well done! It's sort of it's like erm analogy between what's happened in Russia and all that sort of thing cos they couldn't . Ah! Oh right! It is very good! Have to go and see that then girl! Mm. Yeah, could go next weekend if you want? Or Friday? Well we'll be going to see J F K sometime this week won't we? Mm. I wouldn't mind seeing that either actually. I thought William Shatner had been had to be resumed or something. Right. Yeah, the well honestly the toupees are endless! It must of taken them years to get them made up to look even vaguely Has it got Scotty and that lot in it? Yeah. I mean Scotty's seventy six or older than Bones is seventy one. Yeah. Yeah Bones has really aged ain't he? All these old Er, and Scotty's just you know, he's Is, is erm What about Scott? Scott's in it, yeah. Is Leonard in it then? Yeah, they're all in it. Are they? They're all in it. Good lord! Zulu's got his own ship now. Checkoff's in it, and , they're all in it. Oh Zulu still looks young doesn't he? He's probably about sixty ! Yeah. He's looks far better, I think he is a younger . Checkoff's got a toupee. You can Yeah? see it. You know, it moves without his head sort of thing, it moves away! It really is, I mean you'd die laughing! This has gotta be the last one though hasn't it? They say it is. Yeah. Well there's loads of pensioner's jokes in some of these , it was really, very good you know, when Is he still admiral? No, he's the captain. No, yeah, he's the captain of er see he got, he got demoted didn't he? For Yeah. Cos he went out of Scott's . For going into the Ah he got, ah he got done for that did he? And suspiciously Yeah, he didn't wanna be an admiral anyway did he? No! No, it was very good! All about the Klingon Empire diminishing and what can they do about it? Oh hello mate! Yep! I can't pick him up! I think he's still not made out whose home he's in! Yes, yes, you're alright aren't you? We love you! They're very nice cats are. They move when you stroke them They'd do that all night. and dogs don't do they ? As they indeed! Mm. We've been trying to . Crawl in right by the fire can't you? And he's such a hooligan, you know,he's knackered one of his claws again! Daft thing about it, but I thought rather than hang on I'll get in there and get off. Oh! another anaesthetic to cut it back! He's terrible! Hello! then? Yeah! Oh yeah, could do, if we try it . You can just imagine, pull them out! No! Oh no! Well really when I had the same thing , you know,and goes back for a little bit this morning and er same sort of thing. But, you know, it's just when you think oh my god, that's money! I mean, how much do they cost those pills? Cor! Nineteen and a half pounds, I thought they were more than that actually. God! but you know, I mean I know it's not . Mm, it's very nice though,. The mats had were under six pounds this morning, and I pay only half of that. Oh you had to buy the mats do you? Will the company buy them? No. Oh. Well it was seventy six pounds before VAT. Yeah, but you say that I paid thirty pounds for the Astra, now let's get it in the balance here, you see what I mean, and that sen and then Mm. they've, they're you know, quality-wise they're double the quality. Yeah. Plus they're the German ones and you can say Plus more. I can Mm. that that But you'll don't you with it? What? With the car? Oh yes. But it was that or a Vauxhall . Oh no! Oh god! It's not quite the same thing Go for B M W every time! the sports . Ah, yeah, but the B M W I'm afraid is, they've got it haven't they? Oh yeah I I think so too. I think B M W's are the business really! We were Oh you didn't did he? Well not cos we haven't quite got one, a B M W . No, but a a big four wheel drive thing, you know it's quite sort of. Oh, what that one? , yeah. Yeah But you like them! Oh wha what one is it? He'll be at you, why didn't you get one of them? No,wha what's it called? You know, you wanted to drive one. No. Oh that, what that little jeepy thing? Oh I know, not them! Oh aye, you should have one of those! Yeah we saw that in the Radio Times. Yeah, you liked that didn't you? Yeah. They're not that expensive actually are they? They're cheaper than one of those. Oh yeah! Those, you know, the the really should of got one, you know it's , almost a Range Rover. Mm. Fo four door but there's some problem because it's their . Very . Mm. I just thought it was a bit chunky. the car. Oh I would of gone The BM I would of gone for the four wheel I do , yeah but definitely! I know I wouldn't, I think they've been . Mm. Yeah but trouble is you pray for ra , pray for snow when you've got a four wheel drive car! God Yeah. snow, look! Don't really want it. Yeah. So mum and dad are alright are they? Yes, they're fine! Have they drove the car? Yes. I it's nice you know I haven't been no, I dro , I drove that and it's really quite nice but I might I wish he hadn't of got it cos Sue wants it when he's finished with it. Oh. Do you? Seriously, yeah. It's a nice Well have it! sort of, it's a nice little car to drive actually. It's got the Renault, the Fuego gearbox, you know. Mm,. It's, it is really nippy for a one point four! Mm. Erm, and it's, it's all there, it's, you know it's a nice car, it's the nicest car he's had! Yeah. And it you know, good round the cor , really nice little thing to drive, yeah. Even though It would be nice if it . Oh god yeah! Oh, you know, he's . Really ni , I mean you get in there and you feel really comfortable and everything's there you got a nice radio as well and er but yeah, it's really very nice! Much nicer gearbox. It's a typical sort of Renault floppy gearbox, you know what I mean? No. Sort of play about with it and , instead of all boring Yeah. I don't like floppy gearboxes. Oh! I like a nice a positive ! I like that Fuego gearbox. Mm. The same sort of thing as the like this could go through that. Mm! Yep! Straight on! Yeah I know , I said I want one . Mm. Is he gonna go . He's now done a hundred and seven thousand, I think, a hundred and eight thousand. Just about in the ground now innit really? He won't let you . It sounds like a diesel engine so . Yeah but it's erm Didn't he? I didn't think , it's not that old. I've only noticed it five years, it looks filthy, although it's been in the car wash . Hasn't it? Yeah, it's all the on the roads innit? Yeah. But you want a Sierra . No I don't! You wanted the Sierra! You want the four wheel drive but it's not practical! Oh! So that's gone! Mm. Ho how far have you gotta go over before you you get a you'll get a company car at B T? Er head a group or group leader quite a way. Most of those have got P H D's. It's er it's a bit strange at B T! And then you only get a popular ghia, it's hardly worth it! No you don't! Don't you? Or do you? Actually, don't forget Yeah, you a Sierra, yeah. yeah. no, then you've gotta your car. Who? No No. so th th yeah, but . Mm. But,th he is you know, he is very, very good about it, he would know from loads of money and he's and his company could have a one point six Sierra Mm. you know Yeah. you don't think No. but er I think that they were part of your pay rise one year was it? Yeah,th they had a new, a re-think. grading, instead of giving them a pay rise they get That's right. And I mean er, you know car. if yo if you're earning that sort of salary, I'm afraid to say, which you know, the header groups are Mm. I mean, to drive round in a one point six basic Sierra, well it's pathetic It's pathetic isn't it? really! Mm. Mm. Mm. I mean I just think Well, well Mike didn't have one cos he was too tall! Mm. And he kept banging his head on the ceiling! Yeah, I know, it's tall ! So he didn't have one and ma and my group leader he er he's already got about nine cars cos he collects them anyway ! He said, what do I want another bloody car for! So Yeah. he didn't have one either. They get a good deal really don't they? Well we'll be going to an auction to get like a reasonable car. Yeah. Yeah, I'll enjoy that. We shall get, you know, sort of, an E or and F and They must, they must be going for rock bottom prices at the moment there! I saw an E Sierra in the paper for about three thousand that had only done forty thousand er, an estate. Mm. Wasn't a very good, one point eight. But you can save a lot going to the auction can't you? Bit of gamble a though! Well as long as you don't mind the high mileage cars but if they've been going up and down the motorway all the time Not all of them are the high mileage though are they? . Yeah, a fleet car. But never mind! Well Mike went to a we went to the auction at Yeah. to buy and had very much in the sports car range. No , they don't, they tend Mm. to be your typical company Company car Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But they shift So them so quickly don't they? Mm. You don't get time to think about it. Mm. It's like in But then if you, I mean when we went there was that, I mean, okay it was erm it was a van wasn't it? But it was a Vauxhall Astra van but I mean it was E reg and it was three years ago and it went for two thousand quid! You know, and it's got That was in mint condition wasn't it? It was an F, F reg was it? a van. No, it was an E reg. Was it E? But, if you were buying it at a garage you were probably gonna pay at least four Mm. four and a half. Mm. And it was a bargain! Yeah. There wasn't a mark on it, but I mean Yeah. Well that's cos it was a van you see. That's right. But I mean Well no, but I mean even so, the the Sierras your gonna get cheaper there. Well a van for us would be ideal wouldn't it? I don't want a van! Well you don't need to have back seats do you? Especially if there's just two of us. We could dump the dogs in the back and off you go! You want a Sierra estate mate if you want to go knocking about the Lake District with the dogs. Well it wouldn't matter what you what you'd got the ozone, yeah. you always want something better don't you? I mean we went u up to Hunters this morning to get those mats Mm. and there was a a a five Yeah. five, grade five N in er sort of gun metal grey, I mean, it's all grey Oh yeah, yeah. leather seats and er Yeah. and you looked she looked at me and said , But it said . Thirty nine Yeah. nine fifty? Yeah. You you always want something better . Actually didn't he? Who? Nick. Is it? You know Nick ? Yeah, I know Nick. Does he work he work at Hunters on their Mm. ? Mm. Hello! What do you want then? Well we better get, go before they start mate. Yeah, we'd better go to Sainsbury's, Great fun! I hope you feel better matey! Mhm. Ooh! Nice to see the kitchen's coming on at last. Yep. Mm. Hey? No. I reckon she's foxing! I don't do I? No, she just sounds a bit grot! You look very poorly! Any excuse to watch this box, eh? Just doesn't fancy decorating today,that's the No. No. Then you get a week off. Oh course it's, bugger it! It's half term isn't it? You tell her! This is the first time I think we've sat down and done bugger all for ages! Mm. That's alright Sally, I believe you! Er, yeah! Come round again. Getting to my Well I mean this li , room's certainly liveable isn't it? You can get the kitchen done, then you get your bedroom then well Yeah. you're there really. Bedroom's alright. Yep. I'm going up in the bedroom next. Are you? Mhm. Mm. Mm. Oh, when I are you still interested in going to these sales? Well when I next go, you know, when I get back I'll give you a ring. Well I'm not buying anything at the moment but if you wanna have a look round. Good grief! gave you that book. Got that for Paul. Did you? Mm. So I'm sorry I didn't get early enough . But I mean, then I was bound to be very bored, except Yeah. when he comes up. Yeah.. Oh . That's good. Do they have new stuff there as well? No. I mean they've got No, I mean relatively. Erm Not really, no. No. You're better looking at erm for er sort of newer stuff, you know, just old . It's old or tatty really. What's that? Sorry? What's that? The auction. The auction. You know Yeah. the Estate Agent they had er an auction. Of homes everywhere. sorry, not ! . Yeah I was gonna say! Not ,. Yeah,. No they wouldn't , they wouldn't have my leather chair at this auction. No, not a bit! And they wouldn't have it as a nice antique one, that not sort of thing, no. But they might have if is on now. Yeah. It's alright might have offered you something mightn't you? You Mm. might get a er as an offer. normally though I'd ask you but I, time they're gonna get rid of there nice leather chairs, and if they're going bankrupt No. When is there one this week then? Well it's at the er yeah, you could go tomorrow you could go to the erm the viewing on Monday morning. And then stay Yeah. for the sales. Yeah, if you wanted to. Mm. Yeah. Yep. Erm no, but the nice Wednesday one went last week, but there'll be another one in March. Well I quite like that county one, that's plenty for me. Yeah. And erm I do no, have had theirs in February so there isn't that one and erm, have had one as well. But yeah, there's th , the viewing on Monday for the sale on Monday. If you want to go. Okay! And, when I read it in the paper cos it, you know it has the details of the sale of new on the back Mm. it didn't look quite so crappy but I mean nor ,no the trouble is when you read something you picture what that chest is gonna be, it's gonna That's right. what you like Mm. when you go and look at it, you think no, it's Mm. not what I want. Yeah. Yeah. It's the classic example of those chairs we bought an we thought, oh nice set Yeah. of oak chairs, got there and they were gross weren't they ? Yeah, I know but I did get those two nice farmhouse chairs Yeah. in beech so you can't Yeah, worked out alright. Is that those two ? Two balloon chairs. Did you buy two Victorian balloon chairs? No, the farmhouse sort of yeah Straight. spindle back wood. Spindle back, yeah. That's all, I just looked I thought you got some of those with the oval on, the lips on the back? No! No. No? No. Oh. Right. Right we better go mate! Thank you ever so much for coming. Nice to see you! Yep! And erm, Take care, get well soon won't you? Yeah. Have a good time next week! We will. Alright? Have you come in your Porsche? Yes. Well we try to. Oh I don't need a great deal cos we've is bound to be sixty, the the angle at the centre, because that was how we made it. Yeah. Put that down and we thought right draw the circle,space it out equally,six equal angles is what we were doing at the same time as six equal arcs, all at sixty degrees, or all at one sixth of three sixty. Right yeah. Okay. Now the octagon. Could you do that one? Okay. So we'll make a little centre somewhere. Right. Okay. Right. Okay. Erm So what's the angle going to be? How are you working it out? Erm be three sixty divided by eight. Okay. What does that come to? Erm about About . Erm yeah . Use your calculator . So that's three sixty er Could you do three sixty divided by four? It's nine yeah so four and a half. Okay, so forty five. Okay. You start from wherever you like. start that way up. Bit easier. Good. So you'll get all your right angles marked, each ninety, and then the halfway points between Yeah. each ninety. This is I mean you wouldn't do this in an exam, you wouldn't draw one and work how you draw it, but by doing it now erm you get to know a regular figure. You get to know sort of how to construct one. I mean now if i said, Make me a a figure that's got ten equal sides, you could do it couldn't you? Yeah. Or twenty. So you could construct those. And then join the join these points up to the centre. Get that out of your way. So you'll be able to see. Well you know what the angle's going to be at the centre already don't you without Yeah. without measuring, cos it because of the way you constructed it. It's got to be forty five. So we can then when we've drawn that,find out what the other angles are,and try and work out what will always be true and what will depend on which angle you choose. If we draw a join a few of those up through the centre, just so we can mark the angle. So you can join any two opposite corners and it'll go through the centre . Yeah. Erm In fact you might as well do the last one as well. So what angle do you know absolutely definitely without thinking about it ? . And that is what? Forty five. That's forty five. That's your three sixty divided by eight. Okay. . And you've got lots of lots of triangles that are the same. That's forty five right? That's forty five. It looks forty five. Definitely. Yeah. Erm how can you tell it's forty five? Well I mean is there any way you could It's erm prove it? I mean you could measure it maybe and say Yeah. Okay it comes to forty five. You could draw lots of these figures. You did another one sixty, and it came to sixty. Yeah. Well it'd be for the this angle if you extended it so it'd be eight divided by the three sixty isn't it? Erm Three sixty divided by eight. It looks it looks as if it is. I'm not Yeah. disputing if it whether it is or it isn't, but how can we show that it is? How can we say , Erm Well it always will be? Oh right erm Think about what sort of things add up to one eighty. Yeah it'll be all all the angles on this line. Okay. Erm Let's say if we marked This is forty five degrees. Yeah. Okay. What about these two angles, what do we know about them? Oh right they've got to add up to a hundred and eighty Right. right. They're both the same angle for a start, because we've got an isosceles triangle, and forty five plus two X must add up to a hundred and eighty. Yeah. That one there is also X. So here we've got this angle plus two X . Yeah so the two X minus one eighty is Okay. the outer one. It'll always be that one. So this'll work for anything. Now,what was the question? What did they ask? A size of the interior angle of the regular octagon. What do they mean by the interior angle? The angle between these two points. Right. And what should it be? Erm A hundred and a hundred and thirty five. Okay. Right I see . So you've got the right idea of dividing it by eight, but you needed to take it on a stage and see what the was. Erm like I divided Yeah. divi divided divided by eight then minus one eighty. Mm. That'd get that angle all the time. Right. Yeah. It'll always work. Now the other question they've got is,What is the angle between the two rectangles? Well there's one rectangle and there's the other one at right angles to this one. What's that angle going to be? It looks like forty five. Erm It looks like forty five, and it's almost certainly going to be forty five, and we could probably work out some reason why it would be forty five. Would it be erm a hundred and thirty five for the interior angle? That's a right angle there, and Yeah. that's a right angle. Carry on.. Erm minus one eighty to get this angle. To get this one, yeah. And then the same Yeah. the other way round to get that one . So if it was that one, if you could get take that one, it could be anywhere along the plane. If you were at a right angle If it If it was two right ang er angle lines like that at right angles Right. So you do ninety degrees one one of your ninety degrees Yeah. off the off the one eighty . Yeah. Okay. So are you happy with that, that you can if someone gives you someone says Draw er a figure, er a regular polygon with twelve sides, you kn you know how to construct one? Yeah. And by constructing it you learn its properties if you like. This is that's that's the obvious one. That's the Yeah. big thing. That's always divide three sixty by N to give you the angle at the centre of the circle. What about these two angles, what's the important point about those then? Well add up to erm plus that would add up to n a hundred and eighty. Plus that they add up to a hundred and eighty. And . And they're the same. And they're . isosceles yeah. Right. So once you know that, these two are the same you take that from one eighty,halve the answer and it'll give you these angles, and if you've got that ang if you've got these angles,then you can work out most things. . Any q any questions they give you based on that, you'll be able to do it. Erm that way you'll have an understanding of it rather than just saying, Well this bit is always. Would it work for a square? Erm Without drawing it, try and talk about a square. What would happen? Erm How would you work out? If you d Er just sort of talk it through. Drawing a circle, what would you do? Well you'd er mark off Mhm. every erm ninety degrees. Okay. And draw through the points. You'd draw through the four points. work if you d drew a diagonal Okay. the centre. You know. Erm Be ninety. Ninety, ninety, ninety. And these angles would be? What would the angle Erm here be? Forty five. They'd be forty five . Isosceles yeah. So the interior angle. Would be ninety. Would be ninety. Yeah. And the exterior angle would also be Would be forty five. would also be ninety. Oh yeah it would. Yeah. Right? In a square . I see it. So it would work with a square. Erm would it work with a triangle? Erm three points the centre point. Right. So what would the angle at the centre be? It'd be erm twelve. Hundred and twenty degrees yeah . Hundred and twenty. Okay. Yes but it wou cos if you had the centre point up to the top of these two that'd be hundred and twenty, hundred and twenty, hundred and twenty. so if someone said like Do a a hundred-and-eighty-sided figure Yeah. it it'd just look like a circle. But you could do it. So you're happy with polygons? Okay. So that's one if it comes up again Definitely . No problem on that . Yeah. So you've obviously dropped a few marks on that. Yeah. Erm probably on this and on this one. The big thing there is there's no rule in life that says you know if someone says Five them you must draw five centimetres. Yeah. This might have been five knots, five miles an hour, Yeah. decide well we'll have five inches. Erm it is likely that it's not a linear scale anyway. It's possibly the Beaufort Scale Yeah. which is a sort of logarithmic scale . Yeah. Erm so don't make don't make too many assumptions. carry on with symmetry? Yeah. I got all of er for them more. Okay. So let's let's have a look at the others. Now you tell me which ones you think were an absolute doddle. A giveaway. This was the ones here. Mhm. Measure the size of the angle compass. Okay. Did you Erm protractor sorry. did you use that or No cos I didn't have it at the time when I did that. Would it have been an advantage to use the ? Erm well er yes I thought cos I'm just measuring the Yeah. It depends what you're used to. When you get used Aha. to this one, you'll find it so much easier. Yeah. Erm it's a bit off-putting at the start because it's got the two scales on. Yeah. Make sure you're reading the right one all the time. Okay. So no problem there. You think you got Did you did you see which ones you got full marks on? Erm yeah. I didn't do this I d I didn't quite finish this one cos we only had erm one and a half hour to do the two-hour paper like. Okay. And there were how many marks on that then? Erm erm eleven marks like. Mm. Mm. So at the start of the paper,have a quick whiz through, see where the marks are, Do them first, yeah. and think, Well I'm going to Not necessarily do them first. I mean you can whi you could go through and you can pick up lots of ones and twos that build up. You're probably going to do them anyway, and they're good to get you into it. So you're thinking, Oh this hasn't been an exam, these are dead easy, to just play yourself in. Erm but don't like the Mm. ones the or others, if you're getting stuck on them, don't miss something like this that you could do and get full marks. Yeah. Er you know makes a big difference to your final grade doesn't it? Right. Any problems with these? Erm no. They they they were they were straightforward, just Okay. How did you do this one? Erm I drew a I drew a erm Venn diagram. Right. Put my twenty one in the Whimby circle or Whitby circle, and the thirteen in the erm Scarborough circle. Put X in the middle, and twenty one minus X . Okay. Just just show me how you did that one. So a trip to Whitby and a trip to Scarborough. You've got thirty pupils interested in one or both trips. Right. Twenty one interested . in the Whitby and thirteen interested in the one to Scarborough. So there's an X in the middle. How many interested in both of these trips? Erm Now okay. You've got thirty down there, that's good,X in the middle, twenty one minus X, thirteen minus X . Yeah. Okay. So So when you get to that point you you've more or Yeah. less solved the problem haven't you. If you can if you can handle simple equations, you get the answer. Like most of these, the key Mm. is what should we call X. Once you've Yeah. sorted that out then you follow your system. Okay. And does that does that work out? How many would you have in here then? Yes you'd have erm seventeen. So you've got seventeen in there, seventeen in Whitby. And eleven. Okay. And then erm four interested in the both trips so What does that come to? Erm erm it's twelve. Oh right that's not right is it, no. Erm Mm. Okay so we've got eleven and four is fifteen, and seventeen is thirty two. It says there were thirty pupils. Yeah. Mm. Now did you see your marks on this one? Erm no. I d I didn't er not on that one. No that's okay. So there's another one where probably you can pull up your marks quite easily . Yeah. Cos you know you know the method, you know what to do, it's just a question of sorting it out. You know a little bit of extra thinking about it. So one of the points that sort of comes up is you haven't used the thirty at all have you? Now did they give you that and it's something you don't need or do you think maybe it's something you do need? Er . I just didn't know how to apply it . Mm. Okay. Is this basic idea okay? We've got X pupils interested in both, so we've got twenty one minus X in that and thirteen want to go to Scarborough, okay? Thirteen minus X in there. Now where did this come from? Twenty one minus thirteen equals two X. Well you've got your X there, you've got your two Xs there, so you subtract them and you've got Mm. and then take the halve. Well th you've got an equation, okay. Twenty one minus thirteen equals two X. Now where did it where did it come from? Show me where each term from so you could Thanks very much. Cheers Dad. Put away your er luggage. . Er cheers. Scattered about . Cheers. Right. Okay. Thanks very much. . S erm so I had to subtract these two. Mm. Try and explain it in terms of say let's get all these kids out into the school yard, Yeah. and draw two big circles that intersect, Yeah. and say, Now we want to sort you out, see who's going where, so we can organize the coach now, and if you're interested in Scarborough go and stand in that circle,Whit Whitby there, interested in both then stand where the two circles intersect. Yeah. Okay. Now take it from there. What will you what how can you work out Well erm just count how many's erm I mean two teachers come back and one of them says, Well I've counted all those who are going to Whitby. and the other one says, I've counted all those who are going to Scarborough, Mhm. and er nobody remembered to count the ones in the middle. But we do know there were thirty pupils, which hasn't Has that appeared in your equation anywhere? No not really. No. Now erm I still don't really understand where you got this from. Erm Why did you you do twenty one minus thirteen for a start? Well I had the the twenty one and thirteen in the two groups so subtract those two and have twice the amount of X I thought I would have . Erm you you seem to be equating the groups. Okay. We won't go into where you go that from cos I think it sounds a bit like sort of clutching at straws really. Yeah. I'm going to get an equation out of this. You you've you've started off brilliantly. You've got marked on you know exactly how many are going to Whitby,right, twenty one minus X, how many are going to both, and how many are going to Scarborough. So what could you find out from that? That ties up with this. That ties up with . You could er subtract the number going to Whitby from thirty. You could. Erm You could do something a lot And then simpler. A lot simpler. How many pupils were there altogether? There were thirty pupils so And how many are there standing there in the playground? There's thirty. Right? Right. So an equation? Yeah. Count how many you've got in here. We've got twenty one minus So twenty one minus X plus thirteen minus X is equal to thirty. And those in the middle as well. But oh twenty one minus X plus X plus thirteen minus X is thirty . Right. So we just right that down, that's the total. So we've got twenty one minus X those are the ones going to Whitby, and we've got X going to both, and we've got thirteen minus X, and that's the lot. Now assume that this is assuming they all voted. They all said, Yes we do want to go. Yeah. Erm it would have been better if they'd given you some information to say, They all voted for at least one Yeah. trip, or there were four who went nowhere. Okay. So. Erm What does that give you? So it'd be erm thirty four minus two X plus X erm Okay. Er X So how do you just I mean rather than do it in your head, especially in an exam, just what you're going to do, put the Add X to both sides say. Erm If you add X to minus X . Oh it's three yeah. Right. Let's have a little look. Thirty four equals thirty. Right. If we just take it from there. Thirty four minus X equals thirty. Now as soon as you've got a minus X and you're trying to take it over to one side, and you're trying to bring the other one over, there's a good chance that something's going to go wrong. So why not just follow a nice simple system. Thirty four minus X equals thirty. Okay. Add X to each side. They go out. Subtract thirty from both sides. Thirty four minus thirty equals thirty minus thirty add X. Okay. So X is equal to? Four. Which is what you've got there. And Yeah. Now does it add up? It should do this time if your if Is this right? We've got Let's check that. got the same answer still. Twenty one minus X If I give you some numbers to add up. If I said twenty seven add thirty five add forty nine add seventeen, would you add them up like that? Or might you put them one under another? Yeah I'd probably put the numbers Okay. So which are easier to Yes. fit ea slip easier. Twenty one minus X plus X plus thirteen minus X. Tot those up. Plus X and a minus X go out. That gives minus X. Thirty four equals thirty. Erm there may be a simpler way of doing it. Now is this right? Cos we're still getting X equals four. Add the X to each side,take the thirty off each side we've got X equals four. So what's going wrong here? Seventeen and Ah. Oh sorry nine yeah. Nine yeah. Because that comes to because that comes to nine.. Yeah that's right. And that comes to . that comes to thirty. Okay. So it does come to thirty. Erm the way you were doing it will sometimes give the right answer but the easiest way Yeah. is to make sure every box is marked in there. Let's do a slightly more complicated version. Erm scribble on here. Now let's sort this out. Erm let's see Okay. Let's see if those erm Right. This time Let's take that off. This time there are twenty nine in the class. So you've got twenty nine students in the class and fifteen want to go to Whitby,and eight want to go to Scarborough,and three little piggies want to stay at home. Three of them don't want to go anywhere. Twenty nine in the class so what I'd like to know is erm draw the Venn diagram and find out the numbers of students in every section of the diagram. And then if you can do that you can do any problem of this sort can't you? Yeah I suppose so. three. Right. Okay. So where are you going to start? Yeah but this Right. That doesn't add up to twenty nine, does it? It doesn't add up to twenty nine . Eleven. Erm Twenty six. Twenty six. Okay. Well spotted. I probably mean nineteen or something. Let's have a look. Erm Erm Okay. Seven seven don't want to go anywhere. Right. Seven don't want to go anywhere. Right. Okay. That's great. Erm that's So you've got the various sections of the diagram. You've got the Whitby lot, the Whitby and Scarborough, Scarborough and the don't want to go anywhere. When when you when you add them up just if you just put them under each other, it makes it very easy. So keep the numbers That goes there. that's it keep the numbers under the numbers and the Xs under the Xs. Okay it's twenty nine right. So an X plus er So X equals one. Okay. What will that give us? That's Fourteen and seven is twenty one. Fourteen that was sent to me by the the people who want the stuff. So Oh right yeah. . Okay what does that come to? Er twenty twenty nine Twenty nine. Now you might think, Erm oh a bit finickity saying do it this way, but it's a good system. Erm also when you're when you're adding up if you get this fifteen minus X, right, eight minus X and you're putting You just cross those. the numbers underneath each other and the Xs underneath each other, plus X, and then the plus sign X. well that goes with the numbers. Yeah? Then when you add them up You don't get confused. So I can just Mm. take these two off. Because there are Mm. so many, it's very very easy to do. Yeah. Lots of people'll finish up with, Oh that's a three X and they'll put plus three. Mhm. And this way it's more obvious what's going on. There's going to be a minus X left over there, and then you can add those up. Thirty minus X equals, how many were there, twenty nine. And it more or less does itself. Yeah. So as I said, if I give you a list of numbers, say two- or three- digit numbers Yeah. in a long line,horizontally, you'd think, Oh I'd like to put these vertically Yeah. and do a nice little adding up on it. So why not do it with Xs, because there's more chance of an error. Now why it's a good idea to do it that way So I don't in me head like and mixed up. Again in an exam, there's more chance that you make a little slip, because there's little bit of extra edge. nerves like. A similar one. Erm this time everyone's at Wembley and you're asking people,Right, if you draw this time we draw three big circles in the middle of Wembley,okay,and ask people to come and say which football team they think is a good one. So we've got Liverpool, Everton and Tranmere Rovers. So they say The instructions to the crowd are, If you think Liverpool is a a good football team, stand anywhere in that circle, Everton in that circle, Tranmere Rovers, stand in this one. And we get something like this. Erm and let's say there are a few a few awkward ones here er who don't think any of them Yeah. are a good team. So those who think Liverpool is a good one,standing in in that circle, we've got say twelve thousand. Okay. In the Everton circle we've got say fourteen thousand. And in the Tranmere circle we've got erm twenty thousand say. Okay. And we've got thirty thirty thousand people there altogether. Now so I want to know the sort of the numbers in all the boxes. Now Right. talk about it a bit before you start it. Erm is it similar to the problem you've done? Is it harder? Is it much harder? Well it's just erm it's like doing three of the previous ones isn't it like? Yeah. How are you going to sort that out? Erm well I'll start off labelling these W X Y Z. Right. And er label this. That's . So as you're labelling it, what do you think of the problem? Erm it's er Do you think it's easy or very much harder than the last one or just er pretty difficult eh. No. You're not going to be able to just look at it and write down something equals two X are you . No. You've got to really work out what's what. Right. Okay. So you've labelled your diagram and you this one is that minus W minus Y minus X so on. Erm it's a bit a bit awkward-looking isn't it? Yeah just a bit. Could you have labelled it in a way that would sort of help yourself more? Make it a bit simpler. those three added together, so W plus X plus Y plus plus the er the rest of E equal fourteen thousand. Yeah. Okay. So what's your next step from there? Oh right, I write it down on the paper. So erm Okay. And how many equations are you going to get do you think? Erm . About. About. Okay. All right. Hundreds. About hundreds. Erm No erm Well okay let's look at it another way. How many equations would you l would you like? Mm about one. Just one or two. Erm If I gave you a problem about sort of prices of apples and pears I suppose it no I suppose erm two W plus two three Y plus X plus Z Mm. If I said erm, Ten pears plus six apples costs two pound forty, Yeah. how much does one apple cost? what would you say to that? You can't really do it really. Why not? Cos you've got two unknowns. And? And only one equation. Right. So that give you any ideas about this . You got to have two two equations. Two equations. How many unknowns have we got? Erm. Three four five. No. That the I've got I I know these. You know those. I've got four unknowns there. So you've got four unknowns, so you're going to need Four equations right? Does that sound a bit daunting? Yeah. Well so four simultaneous equations. Mhm. And they won but they won't be difficult cos they're all linear. Yeah. They're all there're no X squareds or W squareds or anything else in. . But you can do them. So with with that, you know how much the total comes to, thirty thousand. Right. So I could put Oh aye yeah, W plus e Y plus X plus E equals fourteen thousand. Mm. And erm . Have you used Say in the first one, Yeah. Er you didn't use that. So can you use can you think of an equation that involves that? The total people. Well tell me tell from your diagram, what's the total? Thirty thousand that are there. Right, but that okay ? Oh just these added up? Okay. So don't forget the one thousand who don't think any of them are a good team, add all those up and that will give you a fourth equation. Yeah. And all you need to do then is to find one of these in terms of the others and substitute in, and it'll come out fairly easily. Now you can choose these erm slightly differently. For example you've got lots of got lots of minuses in. What you could have done say was this one here that's marked E doesn't have to be all of those who supported Everton, it could be just that bit. Yeah. Right. And you can an expression for it then in terms of that. But there's no reason why you stop at three. It could have been twenty five different variables Yeah. there are in real problems. Erm With two it's not too difficult. I mean sometimes you can almost just try an intelligent guess and maybe Yeah. about the third guess you try you get the right answer. With that, there's not much chance . No. Okay. Erm so you need to develop a system that's going to always give you a method and is always making the work easier for you and not getting you lost. Okay. So that's enough I think Mm. on that to sort of show you the power of the system we were just using to erm The obvious thing to do is to label every area of the diagram, and don't forget they do sometimes say, Seven were not interested in Yeah. in anything. Label every area and then use what they give you about the total number. The total was thirty pupils,add all that lot up equals thirty. And when you were doing these with lots of you've got now got W X Y and Z in,when you're adding up if you lay them out like that Right yeah. with the Ws under the Ws it's you'll find that those horrible looking equations will simplify quite nicely cos there'll be a plus W and a minus W. I see yeah. And you'll get things that you know you'll get an equation just in X then . So it'll be erm so fourteen thousand minus W minus Y minus X Mhm. and the next one then twelve thousand minus W Mm. minus Y, then Yeah. miss that gap plus Z That's it. Exactly. And then that one Right, you've got it. two thousand plus Yeah. Y and X and Z. So although it looks like, Ooh this is horrible, four equations four unknowns, I'll be here all night And then it's not cos you're just . I've got You're eliminating one at a time. Yeah. Once you've got that fourth equation in from all this lot adds up to the total, and that's the one that you seem to be forgetting, that's the one you've got to try and remember. Okay? So shouldn't be any problem on those. This one er I wasn't too sure either. Mm looks like geometry to me. Mm yeah yeah. So A B is parallel to D C. Calculate the values of erm write down possible Okay. Erm it's geometry. That's the answer to that, Yeah. basically. It's something that I usually say, Leave till the last. It is a Did you spend much time on that? No I j just had a l er Good. er an attempt and then I thought, No I'm not Good. gonna It's a waste of time . It's it's it's the sort of thing that I would always recommend And there's only about three marks for it anyway so. Exactly. Leave your attempt till the end. So rather than you going well on this nice question, and you could you could have done it and picked up Yeah. another sort of six marks or maybe eight marks for the the end bit of the question, erm you'd spent a bit of time on this. Anything to do with geometry unless you've had a lot of practice and you're very good at it, you can finish up wasting time. Yeah. So I would say, Have a go but leave it till last, when you when you've done everything else and maybe you when you've just checked through to see if the others are okay. So let's have a a little look here. Political party making election promises. Erm was that one alright? Yeah. That wasn't too bad. Eight percent every year. a hundred and seventy five billion. Mhm. Erm put it over a hundred times the eight. Okay. And then you add that onto that. And the next Right. year you get Now. Okay. Erm Mm, yeah that's good. And did you do it that way, you worked out the percentage and added it on? Yeah. Added it on after Right. What's Start off with a hundred pound Yeah. and add twenty percent on. Yeah. What's the final amount ? Hundred and twenty. Okay. Start off with a hundred pounds and add thirty five percent on. So a hundred and thirty five pounds yeah. Okay. Start off with erm two hundred and add thirty five percent on. What's your final answer ? Erm two Two hundred Okay. and seventy. So how are you working it out? It's erm two hundred over a hundred Two hundred and then work out thirty five over a hundred of that, Er work out what that comes to, which is seventy, and then add your two hundred on. Okay. Well if we do something like what we finish up with is thirty five percent of two hundred of two hundred okay, plus a hundred percent isn't it? Yeah. Of two hundred. So what does that come to? A hundred and thirty five percent. Oh I see yeah. Okay. . So if you want to So it's if you when especially as you're going to do it on your calculator anyway, . what would you multiply to get the answer straight off? What would you multiply that two hundred by? One three five and then percentage. One point Three oh three five . three five. Yeah, or a hundred and thirty five percent as you said. Yeah. Erm if you find you've got a calculator without a percentage key, and some of them haven't, especially Yeah. some of the scientific ones, mine's got one. erm you can just do that . . So if I wanted to find out erm Let's do that one with the the N H S, and this time I want to know how much it's going to be It starts off at a hundred pounds. Yeah. A hundred billion. Okay, just call it a hundred. And we increase it by ten perc Well let's say we increase it by It's not out money is it, so let's really spend it and increase it by fifty percent every year. Yeah. What would you multiply that by, that hundred? One point five. Okay. So do that try that on your calculator. So what did you get? hundred and fifty pound. Right. So while that's still in, times one point five again. . Well you've still got your one fifty in, so times one point five. So two hundred and twenty five right. And leaving that in, times one point five. That's three hundred and thirty seven point five. So you can see how they as if they ask you to do it over three years or five years or something You just keep on doing that yeah. you don't you're not doing several operations and putting some in memory and bringing it back and giving yourself lots of chances of making mistakes. No. It's just multiply it by that constant thing each time. And with most with a lot of calculators I mean you Don't try it unless you really know your calculator and know how it works, you can just keep pressing equals, Yeah. and it does the last thing you've done times the Yeah. say do it once and say we want six years, put equals equals equals Yeah. more times. Erm if you're going to use =thing something like that in the exam I mean there's no reason why you shouldn't use that multiplying it by one point whatever the percentage is. Yeah. What would you have multiplied it by if it was erm the eight percent? One point eight. One point Well what would you Oh ze oh zero eight, yeah sorry zero eight . Yeah, okay. That's the only thing to watch, that. Yeah cos that'd be Eigh eighty percent that'd be eighty percent yeah. eighty percent is one point eight but eight percent, okay seven percent one point O seven. That's the only snag with that, that you you can get the wrong But it's very much way of doing it . Yeah. Okay. Solve the equation. That's pretty straightforward that. Expand that. You can do that. Yeah. so much for its call-out fixed charge plus the time. That's okay. Yeah. Yeah? And then working backwards. It costs Yeah. sixty five pound And then just er just changing the subject there like. Right. Now if we put that on there. Erm I dunno this is somebody else's paper so This is before I had a I worked it out as I I th I thought it'd work out a three- four-five triangle. Mm. Did you work out it was a ninety degrees? Erm yeah well I I Why? I realized that cos Why? Cos it looked it? No cos erm the here you've got this in a semicircle, Right. and if it's touching Okay. the top it's always ninety degrees . Did you say that on the paper? Erm I just put a little arrow with ninety degrees in the semicircle . Mm. Cos it looked it. Erm wh what they're looking for in this answer is erm Because it's the angle in the semicircle angle B is ninety degrees. Yeah. And then carry on and do the other bit. Erm you know you can look at that or you can put a protractor on it and Mm. think Well that's ninety, but you need to say that it is ninety because it's the angle in there. Yeah. Okay. Right. So you'd probably get minimum marks for that . three marks for that anyway. Mhm. What did you think of this? I looked at it and I er panicked. Then I looked at it again and I realized that it wasn't too hard. Mm. I mean I got er the only th part erm I did mess up a bit was the the part here. Mm. Cos I got this the wrong way round. But other than that I got the right. Right. Now this this what I'd like you to do,is read it out but only read the absolute bare bones of it. We don't want to hear anything about Janet having trouble with her bike and Janet a powerful young woman or riding the race of her life , or any don't want Yeah. any of that. It's just rubbish. When you when you're reading this through, you're having a quick skim through, you can can you can cross out, you can sort of totally obliterate Yeah. what you don't want to know because it's One of the problems here is there's so much noise. Yeah. There's so much random stuff that you don't just details irrelevant . yeah. You don't want to know that she was wearing odd socks and one of them was green, it's Mhm. nothing to do with drawing the graph of distance against time. So what are the important points in that ? That they set off neck and neck. Okay set off neck and neck. Right. Alright. Then Janet took the lead then overtaken ten seconds later. Mhm. Then built up a lead of fifty metres. Right. And so she behind all the way but caught up with her a few metres Before the end. before the end. Oh just before the finish, fifty metres from the finishing line. And then Janet overtook her just before the finishing line. Right. So all this about the North Rose Trophy and it's just When you see You f you said you felt like panicking. Yeah. You're in middle of an exam, you're trying to do everything very quickly, and there's a great long screed of text Mm. to plough your way through. Erm so get sort of practise reading it so you can cut out the irrelevant stuff. And a good thing as I say is to just erm highlight the stuff that you want if you've Yeah. got a highlighter, or maybe underline it, and maybe even cross out. Yeah. Because you rea you're going to read this about three or four times aren't you? Yeah. before you understand what on earth is going on here. They started off neck and neck. They started off together. Okay. This one goes in the lead and then stops and then the other one goes in the lead and then she puts a spurt on and catches up. You'll read that sort of round and round a few times before you get it straight in your head what's Yeah. going on, and you don't need all this garbage in it as well. So your first time through you can cut some of that stuff out, and then you've got it. You've got the bones of the problem. Then you can work with it. Erm so do you think you got it sorted out roughly? Even I mean you didn't quite get it sorted out in the exam but No. did you think that you know what you've done wrong now, Yeah. and how to do it? Yeah. There's there is often something on distance time graphs and also quite often it's like that. Now I think that's not a maths question. No. No. That's an English question. Yeah. I mean if you I don't know if you know of anyone whose standard of English is quite poor No. but their maths are okay. Mm. Now that's quite an unfair question. Cos if they can't read through a lot of text and sort it out they haven't got much chance . No. They just sit there mesmerized for half an hour and then Right time's up. Okay. So you're alright on trine time train Yeah. train timetables. Mm? You just draw a line of best fit you know line of best fit through erm all the points well Okay. the one that goes nearest the majority of points. One goes nearest the majority of points. Okay. So if you've got a load of points all here Mm. and there's one stray off here, you'd go through that way, the line of best fit. Ignore any strays. Mm. Okay. How about the gradient of the line? That's like the average what is it it's a Distance so it's the average speed that's been travelled throughout the journeys. Mm. Erm the gradient of a line okay, there's a there's a bit of graph paper. Okay X is and there's a line. What's its gradient? Erm the change in the Y Okay it so change in the It it's so measure measure the gradient of that and tell me what it is. I'll make it so they're nice and e even. Now you said you'd make it even. Yeah. What did you mean by that? Oh t I had two point nine by three Mm. by seven point nine. Okay. The one you made nice and easy was the nice and even was the Y. Yeah. Which one are you going to divide by? The Y, so change in Y over change in X so Mm. You're going to divide by the X . Oh yeah, best off doing the Yeah. It doesn't matter cos you can . . Better get rid of that line yeah. Probably pencil . Okay. And what does that come to roughly ? It's about erm two point eight. Right. Two point eight Seven centimetre. So that's erm . . What's what's the units? I don't know it's just whatever the Well what have you done? What did you do? Oh I cha I divided Y over You divided Divided the change in Y So many millimetres Yeah. by another number of millimetres Oh right, oh millimetres that's it yeah . and what's the answer? Erm millimetres . Millimetres divided by millimetres is what ? Yeah it's millimetres square. Millimetres erm the other one. What is it? Erm What's X divided by X? One. Er one X. Just X. Just one. It's just millimetres . No it's just one. It's not millimetres, it's nothing. It's just a number. So that's just millimetres then yeah . It's millimetres divided by milli No, it's not millimetres. No this . The answer is not in millimetres. The answer is just a number. Oh right. It's a ratio of one length to another. Okay? Yeah. Find the ratio of that height to that length. Mm. Okay. And let's say it's a third. Mm. It's not a third of metre, a third of a millimetre or a third of a kilometre, it's just a third, the ratio of that length to that one. Okay? I see. So the ratio of that length to that one is point four. But the gradient the gradient of the hill erm you could express it in terms of an angle couldn't you? Yeah. If I say, Is that hill very steep? Ooh yes, about forty degrees. So if we look at this Twenty five. Twenty five. Find the tan of twenty five degrees. It won't be in centimetres or millimetres, it'll just be a number . Two point four six. Right. Six three . That's a much more accurate way of finding the gradient. . Just find the tan of the angle. You don't have to measure. You've got two measurements here. This two point eight isn't accurate. No. It's what, plus or minus point one almost. Yeah. I mean point one of a millimetre's not much. You could be almost well you could at least plus or minus point O five. Yeah. Right. Which is a big percentage that you're And both of these could be out. One could Yeah. be too big and one could be too small, which would make a big difference. But you can measure the angle pretty accurately on that to s to within say half a degree and have its tan. Right yeah . Erm because there's your angle,there's that, and this is opposite over adjacent. So the gradient it's a ratio it's not no units to it, not metres millimetres or anything else, and it's the tan of the angle. So the gradient gives you a mea If I gave you the gradient, if I said the gradient is one, what would the angle be? Erm How would you find the angle? Just one and then do the tan backwards. Okay tan to the minus one . five. So there's a that's that's what gradient means, the tie-up between them. It's not In some cases like erm the diagram you were doing about the two girls running,erm then the distance against time gradient will give you speed, give you velocity. We've done the Roses,you're okay on the symmetry, you know about that now. Yeah. I mean if if it hadn't got a ,there's noise in the problem there's Yeah. irrelevant stuff. If you if you you strip it down to the Actually I didn't know how to do the arc . I wasn't sure how to do that. Okay. But you know now. Erm That was pretty st that the height of just a bit of It's a bit of algy and a bit of pythagoras Yeah. in together. And the area. What is how about that one? What is the square root of six point four by ten to the ten to the five? Well erm eight hundred but when I did it wrote it into normal terms like six point sixty four with one two three four noughts Mm. and then I square rooted it. Mm. Erm yeah, I square rooted it. Okay. Yeah that's a good way to do it. Mm slightly more easier for you is just multiply it by one of those tens so you've got sixty four by ten to the four. The square root of sixty then take the square root of Eight. The square root of the sixty four is eight, the square root of the ten to the four ten squared. Oh right yeah. Yeah. Erm okay. It's a good way to do it to if you think, Oh I can't really handle this going on here, put all your noughts on and then you can work out what they come to. Okay. Erm weather stations near the north pole. we should start ringing alarms bells a little bit. So what did you do for this one? Right I measured well it's seven kilometres apart so I measured the distance between them. Ah. Mm? Erm in centimetres or millimetres . And it came to five. It wasn't seven centimetres eh ? No so it's And it should have been shouldn't it? fifty millimetres. Right. Okay, so you worked out what the scale was. Yeah. And then what did you do? Erm I so it was for one So seven kilometres is equal to fifty millimetres. Mhm. I did erm Yeah. So you seven work out your scale that comes to So seven over five. And then what did you do for this next bit? It knows it's between four and three kilom kilometres away. Yeah. So er point seven one er is equal to one kilometre. Mhm. So work out the Yeah. So four kilometres so multiply point seven one by four. Yeah. You worked out what that would be and then on the one the scale and then what did you do ? Yeah I worked out what this would be on the scale. that's from T so I dr drew a line a cir a circumference . A circle. Right. So I did round there. Yeah. and a smaller one round there. Right. So you work out . what the scale is so you can set your radius and draw your two circles and say, It's in there somewhere. Yeah. Okay. That should get full marks. Yeah. Bit . Mm. Erm er that trig trigonometry there again. Mhm. And then er just work out the length of this and then the length of that and then subtract these two lengths. So that's quite a nice question. Erm Seven marks on that. Okay. Transformation. You alright on the transformation? Yeah. Yeah. You've been doing those alright haven't you . . Ah. Mm. How many of those can you get out of one of those eh? Erm How many mugs of water to fill the tank? . Okay. So you cal calculate the volume. Yeah. That one's no problem. Yeah. You think, Right I've done that with me fish tank. That one. What did you do for that? Erm I used the equation sheet which he wri wrote on the board. Right. Okay which would have been on the front of your paper . Yeah but he we didn't have any Right so as soon as you see that you think, Ah volume of a cylinder, I know, whee! straight to the front. Look at it and then erm measured it I did I d and then I redid this one and put it in the same scale, Yeah. and then erm the answer I got for this Mm. So divided it by that. you what did you you used centimetres here did you? Yeah. Right. Good. Because that thing you did with the fish tank has shown Yeah. you that you can't say, Well one centimetre is a hundredth of a metre so No. one cubic centimetre's going to be a hundredth of a cubic metre. it's obvious. It's not it might be obvious but it's not true. Okay that that's the big thing they're looking for there. Convert it to the same units, use the formula and then I mean that's a gift that isn't it? Yeah. Mm? Six marks there for nothing really. Imagine them all bringing their mugs to fill the tank . Mm. Now you've got to rework it again in cubic metres Yeah. and work out how many seconds. There's nine marks on that Yeah. really a gift wasn't it? Yeah I mean it's a it would be a joy to do it as well cos you think, I know how to do these. Yeah isn't this easy, this is relaxing. Okay. Erm I think you know there how to pick up quite a few Quite a few more marks yeah. quite a few marks without you learning anything No. that you don't know already. Yeah? Yeah It's just sort of looking at 'em a bit. Erm the geometry one that we didn't look at,you might be able to spot it in minutes, Yeah. you know seconds even. You might be still on it twenty minutes later. Yeah. So keep it for the end and keep it for when you've not only done all the questions but had a quick check through to see have Yeah. you done something daft. Yeah. Cos that's where the marks are thrown away. Not Yeah. not something you can't do but something you've done ten times before. You just make a one silly mistake like. And you just think you know you like you've put metres instead of centimetres on the the hosepipe or something like that and you think, Oh that's not right, that you will spot . Like when you write a letter and you read it through and you think, Ooh I've missed a word out here, Mm. or I've you know run two words in together or something. So that few minutes at the end is important for picking up these extra marks you've been trying to throw away,okay, where you can do it, and the few minutes at the beginning is to look through and find that question wherever it was, that one on the last page. Lot of marks going for it, dead ea And again it's a s it's a joy to do this sort isn't it. Yeah. Cos you can see where you're going all the way through, Yeah. you know that you know it it's nice It's just like nice and easy. and you feel really confident about it, you think, Wow this is piling up the marks . So look for the good ones don't spend too much t There'll only be one little geometry thing Yeah. fiddling about with triangles and circles and stuff like that. So have a go And it's only about two or three five marks. Exactly. So have a go at it when you've done the others. Okay. Well I'd better get off. another one to get to soon. That's mine. That's yours. Right. Practise with that protractor, Yeah. so that you get used to it so that you prefer to use it to the other one. Have have have both , but if you've got bearings It easy to b better . use that . If someone gives you a polygon to draw Yeah. Use that cos it's not not fiddling Yeah. around twisting it. I mean in the time is takes you to do a sketch you can draw accurately Be easier to . draw round it,dot dot dot,draw even if you then sketch it without using a straight line, if you just join up the dots freehand , Yeah. you get a very good sketch and you can see what's going on and you can see the angles. . That's your one. Erm Next week. What's happening about that? Where are we ? I'm on holiday then so er You're on holiday. Right. Yeah. Okay. So is that for What about the week after that? Erm no I think I've got about two weeks off. Okay, so I'll see you erm So we break up on Wednesday that's Friday Friday, So three Fridays. Three Fridays. Yeah.. So I'll see you in about I'd better work out what the date is. Erm Can have a look on the calendar in there. Okay. And probably be an idea if you remind me sometime during that week when I'm due to see you. Alright yeah I'll give you yeah . Just give me a just give me a ring. But er we'll we'll skip the next three then. Alright yeah. Okay. I better remember my tape recorder. Okay. Erm I've found out when the exam is. Yeah? It's erm right at the end of the month of the rest of the exams. Okay. So erm Yeah it's well well at the end of the month. So have you got what's what's the best Morning Mrs . Good morning Doctor. Well now, what can I do for you today? I've been coming for sh three weeks now. And I came to ask the doctor if I could get H R T. And she took my blood pressure and it was too high She chased you. so she didn't give me anything the first time, but she Mhm. The second time. The second time, it was a different doctor again, and she gave me tablets and I can't remember the name. It was I just took the last one on Saturday, and I then threw the Aye. The wee white ones, Aye. Right. Brusc something Aye. So Right. Show us your muscles. Let's see what you're doing to your poor old self. I don't know why I think maybe the, the tablets helped, but erm I was saying I was kind of having second thoughts whether I was wanting to go on the H R T or No. No. No chance. No chance. Not, not with your blood pressure up like that. No er well she didn't say much, but she Well, no chance I can tell you now. Whenever er Just get yourself down. And I thought er and er I had wee tablets that you gave me a while ago,Brusdeximit Mhm. And I was wondering maybe if I'd be better going back on them. Aye, you'd be safer a lot safer on them. And they won't er they won't fight with your blood pressure. Here just let your arm . On second thought, it'd be . Aye. It's, it's amazing how many folk come up to see about it, and they, they decide eventually not to. Doing fine. You're fine but you'll need to stay on your wee tablets I'm afraid. And er I think you can forget the H R T. I will, I felt maybe er when I came up to see, oh I was having all these heavy sweatings. Just was it was really Mhm. Mhm. pain up sore back, so. And Falling to bits. to bits . then I had another I had another wee problem that I'd been, I had been to see, and it was Doctor I had been, and the doctor that I saw the last time er I had three big bruises on my back, and she Mhm. says I don't know what this is. But this was a wee sort of lump that I had down at the bottom of my vagina. Right. I don't know whether you would call it a lump or not, I said to her it was like a wee spot. Mhm. So she, she says well I don't know researchers where we're actually going to go through all the procedures, highlighting , the changes are and why. Elizabeth, could you just sort of mark that in your minute, as something that if we do produce a highlight of changes, that is one that we . the first thing which is re , a really major change to peoples behaviour. It, from the requirements of the standard it does only imply where you haven't got a covering letter or anything like that with it. Yeah, that's all the time though. 'Cos all our reports probably go out with compliment slips, all our . 'Cos if you've got copies of the reports and things in the file, then that's not a problem. Where the problem arose was when there was no record of anything having been sent or what had been sent or anything. Well, what do you mean, if there's a copy of the report in the file. I mean, if there's a copy in the information office is that good enough proof that it's gone? Well, this is up to you to decide what you actually proof if you need it. This is a not unreasonable thing to have as one of our procedures remind you and ten, twenty . No, I know. Now let's move on to Q P9. I think this is the closest that we'll find. Well, I'm not quite sure that's what it's called. Is it called client contact form? Client contact record sheet. Sheet. Client contact Record sheet. Record sheet. It's not a form, it's a sheet. Is that referred . You take your , do you know that? What? Advertising campaign, you probably don't know.. Oh yes, I do. your sheet. Have you changed your sheet. Is erm, set down as a related document form there or? Kleenex Not yet, no. I was gonna say Andrex. . So, in this case I do inherit a new form, do I? No one else has got, has someone else got responsibility for client contact record sheet? No, I don't think they have. I think I have, 'cos I think it's on the erm, Q P whatever it is, document control policy records and I think that's one of mine. Oh yes, it will be and it's , it'll be in the list, the list of what should be in the master job file. . Yep. In the list. Yep. It'll be in that. Quality records? Yeah. Client contact record sheet. Now I've got a suggestion form from Sarah here with four points on it. Is this on Q P5? Is that on Q P5? It's still on five, yep. Point one; er, for access the field element is pre-booked, it's only necessary to book additional days or shifts verbally in excess of that already reserved. Will that come under the erm, when they inact continuous or would it continue as a non-standard survey? No, Ros has already argued that in most cases access is covered by a standard procedure survey. Right. So, what if it says Simon, because I wasn't paying attention. So point one does not apply to access,have to have. Yep. Well, let's carry on with, there are others here. Point two. Booking forms are used for access face to face. Erm, a schedule is used as a telephone omnibus detailing all the projects on that particular survey. So, there's an appropriate booking form for face to face which is actually in excess,. I'd say so. Well, is it oh no, no, no. Come on. Can the term er, appropriate booking form cover this thing called the schedule. Oh yes, yes. Er, oh. Call it a booking form. Form? Yes. I was just saying that's what a booking form is, a schedule isn't it? No, I mean the , the others have actually got booking form written on them. Are we gonna be changing the name of the schedule to booking form. Yes. Or booking schedule. Or booking sheet. Either that or we write a couple of variations on the end of this and we say the general access conforms to this but in their case, the other one is pre-booked,the extras and they have a booking schedule. 'Cos this says specifically in the applications, with the exception of continuous surveys. Therefore, and I think we'll all take access to something that we would . Paul, point Q does not apply to access by telephone which is what we're for. Mmm, well we don't particularly want access to exempted from the procedure. No. Which, if we car , if we call it continuous survey then it would be. I've also got points at point three and point six now. This is when erm, we need to go back and look, look at your continuous survey procedure. Yes. Which we've already talked about and there's no reason why erm, you cannot have a one pager for access. It says it works in accordance with our normal procedures except and rather than put the exceptions for access in that procedure,. This requires us going through these with toothcombs as we've frequently already got access as an exception in them. We had it on this procedure, already. It's not complete, is it? One point four. And it's coming, and from what Simon was saying, it's coming in, in other places as well. Yes, points three and point six. I think very good at going through with a toothcomb anyway and I'm sure that she could quite adequately. There's a fundamental problem in here that my definition of the continuous survey includes access. If said to me, what's a continuous survey I would put access in it. Aren't we going to . This procedure says the continuous surveys are excluded and then specifically says erm, what applies to access except this one. I think that's the aberration, isn't it? The oth , the other's don't say except continuous surveys anyway, do they? Most of them don't. Yeah, but we have got a problem with the other's, so far. This is the first where we've got a lot of problems with access. I mean, my concern here is that if you've got a procedure that's got nine points in it, and effectively we're going to go through one, two, three, five of those nine points and say either this does not apply to access or access does it differently. They're not working in accordance with that procedure. None of this really applies, if you read each of these they don't apply to access, in the real sense, do they? In the full sense that them, we're talking about. . Well, five can't apply 'cos four . it sounds to me as though we should let the, the application stand with the exception of continuous surveys. Delete this reference, point four does not apply to access by telephone, take up Carolines point that we need for access when we've got through the other continuous a brief statement which says, the project planning procedure doesn't totally apply until . If we leave Project planning. It's not a separate procedure. It's, it's a document available within access. Oh, I see. It just says , it's different. But there's a continuous procedure that says . Right, so there'll be a statement here or would that be in . There'll be a statement in the procedure that Richard is going to write on behalf of Jenny. Oh, right. Which defines a list of things which will have their own er, statement exceptions. So, if we're leaving with the exception of continuous surveys in there, where do we say er,. I thought we were gonna write So, we're going to write that in. Because those That's gonna be in the individual master job file. They're gonna be in their master job files. Any differences. But they all follow this. Virtually, I think. Fine, in that case. Then they just have somebody who says, we follow procedure of Q P5 . They don't even need to do that. If they are actually following a standard company procedure the project planning is very good monitoring. Yes, the continuous procedure only allows you the freedom to make changes if you need to. So, if you don't need to. I, I would suggest that any areas here at, as a overall statement where you said things don't apply to continuous, that those are actually taken out and that every procedure applies to everything, unless it is specifically removed and your continuous one allows you the Yes, that is reasonable now we're creating a continuous one, isn't it. I mean, that was obviously put in here at the time that we didn't have anything that covered it. Oh, that's right, yes. So, I think perhaps if you take that out and write this continuous and non-standard one, it allows you the facility for using it or not using it, depending on the project you're working on. Presumably should we therefore have something that covers quality, oh sorry no this covers it doesn't it, yeah, o.k. Richard another point Erm the only reason this is an issue that I get a cooking for as Research Process Manager anyway, as Audit Manager I need to have other booking forms, and the only booking forms and additional booking forms I need are all jobs which then got to Mrs which are the so I ask please make amendment to put Audit Manager in and I don't think we need to specify. Erm can someone make it clear to me where we ended up with Q P5, I am not sure whether we are changing the application or deleting Yes the exception both doing both your doing both yes. Is this being appraised with the exception or continuous service with the application, and we are deleting that point 4 doesn't apply to access. We will have a new procedure called Continuous and Non-Standard Surveys which says that they will follow the basic procedures, except where this doesn't make sense, and if it doesn't make sense the job will have in it's Master Job File a statement of how, it does comply with whatever it has to deal with. Now on that point, for access someone now needs to pick up and write effectively a simple this is how we project planning on access. And there may be one or two other things we work through over this meeting and the next meeting. We are close to the end of erm You should be lively signing this document. We might call it a day at the end of the assignments and take Jenny's away to recap, erm lets get to the end of the assignments first, Q P9. Where is Q P9? papers rustling This one I think we should give a little thought, because this is the one I think where oh yes this is going to get complicated because I have now been given a quiff and a few suggestion forms about it You said you didn't have the print of it, is that right? Yeah Richard's has given me Your'e still missing two? This is also one where we chase our search approval forms, and procedure. we've got quite a lot of these reports together here. It's also the one that covers You should continue this as a staff meeting with The only change that I have got here are minor things that were references from a previous meeting all the difficult stuff comes from the Quiff and the suggestion forms that I have not looked at yet, and so if you want to do that around a table because I don't know whether thats right. Can you Erm, I I just hoped to dictate to you which would cover the changes of the research approval form Well there is a list of things, list of points here, 4C does not apply to scan 5, does not apply to scan T G I questionnaire. 9 Research approval forms for relevant to T G I space. 10 does not apply to T G I Survey. The reissued so that the reissued quantitated appro.. search approval form no longer has provision for B P questionnaire approval. Continue reading first continue reading. Company survey's will not go through data prep but D P approval is critical why has this been removed from the form? Because the only job we haven't capped, is continuous and there are no procedures for continued jobs yet, and we have not yet got an ad for Kathy job and therefore no procedures were a mythical thing. However. laughing However, as we write these continuous things which we are talking about, approval for Kathy clearly is an issue permanent restructuring for each I'd suggested to Sarah it might be covered by Q P10.5 which actually says that the research approval form is signed by the researcher which she felt wasn't really enough. That was my understanding of what might be meant to cover that point. That she felt that it was really something D P actually signed off.. Well there is not for Kathy but for Kathy she thought this would be. Well they keep a record now don't they D P keep a record anyway, there is a system where D P keep their own records perhaps it would be helpful they've authorised If I just read out what I was going to suggest Simon described the new system for approvals it goes something like erm, sorry it's 9.9, all approvals are recorded on research approval forms full stop. Erm in order to simplify the approvals from Support Division, field approval is recorded on the field review form, data preparation and D P approval is recorded on data preparation schedule the name of the person giving approval, the name of the person, the names of D P's approvals are recorded on the research approval form. So obviously you just write down that Rita did it on the 10th. But Rita in her own department has got the document that she sends so the researcher doesn't have to take the bit of paper round to everybody and get their research approval form signed. That's fair enough because you get action Sorry, There's not room on the form I don't think It doesn't matter cause Rita can't D P could authorise it. I said we haven't got a procedure for Kathy I thought you were reading out the bit to All I have been saying is the things which aren't Kathy's everything else questionnaires. Now Kathy seems to me should be checked checking the assessor, just as if it was going over the telephone Well then that's just what I was just trying to think through on Kathy. Well we don't have procedures for it, we haven't written them. Sorry if you take catty as the para now, then D P aren't actually, the reason D P sent the paper questionnaire is to just double check that all the columns and everything are laid out in the correct way aren't they and then checking it for that reason, whereas they are actually doing it on something like Kathy themselves so they, there isn't the same approval going on. Someone's got to check the filters are right The does that on a Catty Questionnaire Well he does that on every questionnaire, but he still has got to get someone to double check it. Mmm, it's that element of double checking that But, I mean that D P team do a lot of work on the Catty questionnaires which doesn't really seem to be er sort of fully acknowledged at the moment. Yes, I think that as Richard said we need to agree if quality is to continue we have to write some Kathy procedures. That thats certainly With a timetable to them we are in the best place to do it now cause we're still learning we have only done three jobs, four now haven't we? erm the Kathy procedure is definitely needed. We are grinding to a halt on those aren't we? yeah We got D P 9.16, 28.32 we've still got four to do. Are any of those other one simple, what you would consider simple ones to understand? Erm, I will have to look at them They are actually. As 9 is one that obviously needs a lot of work and a lot of thought on it. I am proposing to delay 9 as a question for the next meeting Qualitators, quality control rustling paper. Erm this was the suggestions from Rita All of them seem very sensible to me. Well I have accepted adding those research review meeting. Yep. Are you, what are you going to call this form now Si Is it the qualitative review form or Erm it is an existing It's called a Qualitative Data Review form no it's called a Qualitative Research Review form so what's this in the something else. Oh I see as opposed to that which is how many groups they proceed to check. The qualitative research review form it's existed for sometime. So thats now reference and there is a project review meeting as there is a quantitative work. You have got four things sorry related documents. Four how have I got four? I've qualitative field review forms, yeah qualitative data review forms yeah qualitative research approval forms. It does exist, but it's not referenced here, but it does exist. And if it's not referenced here it may not be referenced anywhere else. Well, it needs to be Q P9 then doesn't it? Where we were just now with the research then talk about questionnaires. Called research approval forms. No there is a separate one for qualitative and it is different. Yes it has a lot it has a lot less on it, things like.. Is this document on that side do you know? What? No, I just have qualitative approvals It's not mentioned anywhere I think it ought to come up first in Q P9 doesn't it? Well can I make a suggestion that you add it all to the list of the things to discuss it is . Authorisations. Did you get that one Simon? Erm Discussion of Q P9 we need to decide when we qualitative approval form or whether it gets,business procedure Q P16. In that case we can't finalise this one until we have decided that. So I think that should be bought up. No one owns this form what we are trying to do is make sure it's ready so therefore it has an owner. It seems sensible that it goes with wherever the The qualitative procedure is aware of your design procedures. They may do a few they're not going to cut there, they will cut . Yeah but it doesn't really fit in here at all, I mean it's nothing to do with any of this. Nothing to do with any of this at all. It could come up under You see my visions for qualitative are slightly different to the four months at the moment, and I feel perhaps could exchange Q P16 for the control procedures to be a longer procedure but to have everything covering the project plan in progress monitoring through to quality control procedures for just the quality. So if you look at something like Q P5 where you have got this point qualitated, in fact a lot of the points don't actually apply to qualitated because many of the points relate to erm, D P erm,qualitative field as opposed to survey. So I do just wonder if I couldn't pick out point say 1 and 2 of Q P5 and 6 which are about booking and booking forms and confirming the commission of qualitative through to whatever is required during the run off of it and then add the quality control check and finally you have got this, the final review. So in other words qualitative, the whole of qualitative between commissioning as merit checks has an er Yes o.k. that a major review of the whole thing though. Do you want me to have a go at doing that Simon? because I have been difficult about it, if that helps you. Well that would be welcome but it's fine, and it should be down to me to do it, but you are all welcome. O.K. I'll try do a version, but it does effect on Q P 5 an Q P6 you see as well coughing. Can you and Simon liaise . coughing. Do you think that's a good idea? Yes I think it is. Could I explain one alteration on Q P16 Simon given our recent changes. We've got this erm, er, some one is going to monitor a proportion of work that you have recorded as transcripts anyway, and it will be a research director or A.D. I'm just wondering whether we can comply with this now. Er, well will you leave that to me in the re-writing of this. Sure absolutely. Q P16 we are going to move on from then, unless there are any other comments on Q P16, Rita is going to attempt to redraft and draw together material from previous procedures, and that means that adjustments of previous procedures you will be able to sign, and finalise them. Sorry, are you saying that erm we are going to delay doing anything about Q P5. I would, in that, in the light of well, actually no we don't have to . In actually physically up dating anything, I would suggest that at this point that Simon doesn't do of them until after the next meeting when we have got all the other's together as well because again they may attach things, just that you've got your information and know what's been decided and do the whole lot after the next meeting. Can't we get Monica to do the up dating ? I think it would be easier to try and draw them together so that we have got this document with the position so far, as we have a lot . It's very hard, I am finding it hard to keep up with them at the moment. Certainly we shouldn't re-issue anything until after the next meeting but erm, having the procedures we have finished with so far, in their latest form probably helpful, even if it's only you whose has the master copy Simon right so when we need some reference, we have got that chapter and verse. Monica I am sure would be quite happy to. laughing She will be ecstatic She certainly won't be. This is what worries me, if you have got too much stuff going through one person that . That's what will confuse her. But their always in version two. No there not, this is going to be an interim version between one and two, what Dot's just suggested. It's still typed as two. I it's she will type it in as two, and then you will give her the next draft and then two and then the next draft and then two, I mean there's no confusion there for her. That is extremely confusing for her, cause she has on her computer, she has various versions named in two, unless she destroys previous versions of M2 when she does this one Well she should she should overtype the correct one Which isn't what we did with M1 Well then one is a complete rewrite. But we had various versions of M1, but we didn't ever get rid of the first version, so we could, the one that Suzannah did and then the one that I changed, and then the one that the Committee changed, all exist so that we can back track what we actually did. Right. How did she with this we just need to type over it No, we do, I mean you do this just the same as any normal report, you do the first one and then you edit it and make yeah, yeah. Monica will be alright she know's what she's doing, it's just whether she has the time to do it, she would liked it if we had done this before Christmas, so that while you were away John you could have done it she had plenty of time to do it. Would we be able to do erm, just a sort of support ones and D T P if we got the masters from Monica as a standard responsibility. Yah, now she's made them out, shall we say we will take that one to share the load. If Monica gives a brief one. Press on please to Q P 28. papers turning I don't think I've got anything new on this so all of this comes out of B T 7, and this is all to do with Stella's original paper about who had responsibility for forms and so on. Any problems with these proposals. Seem perfectly sensible to me. Accepted. Right then number 32, Q P32 Erm we are renumbering some points in that one, erm we were trying to avoid it before but I can't seem any way of avoiding it here because these are major new things. Then there's the new additions I'm sorry about that. papers turning The proposals on Q P 32 actually reflects erm, the decision we made earlier on my, my proposal about suggestion of whose responsible for . Sorry. Well I think points 6 to 7 are to the procedure owner who communicates what action and under responsibility both points it's actually procedure only and not divisional quality manager. That would be o.k. if the only suggestions allowed were suggestions about procedures. We have just agreed that we would allow suggestions about procedures and other suggestions about the way the Company is run. They are often the same person or principal it could be either in divisional quality manager or procedure Just a change of how we would suggestion box unless So maybe Simon a brief statement in the application yep would clarify. Well. we decided that we didn't need to change the application I suggested that. This procedure describes how suggestions for improvements to systems and procedures are generated. Well in that case how about on method point 1 suggestions for improvements we need the word 'two procedures'. yes yes suggestions for improvements yes suggested to for improvements to procedures. Well I suppose we've got to reissue it anyway so we might as well. Yeah, yeah. Good. I propose Elizabeth that you circulate Jenny's reprocedures to everyone but we don't know with them, that we will read them prior to the next meeting and agree them at the meeting papers turning I have got to assess papers turning take one. Take one of those, I've taken one, take loads of copies Three procedures coming out I thought I was getting it already anyway laughing scattering the whole process . Can we just agree one final bit of detail before we pack in, there are a number of procedures now either which we be re- prepared as the basis of today's discussions, we have only got two, have we, is there just two? three three 17 18 and 21 21, I've got 17 18 21 is choices, it was the first one to come round. Don't try to blame me. Bottom pile in choices if you can send it back. Are there any spares to erm oh yeah thank you, Suggestions, in preparation for the next meeting, for those procedures that we still have to review, the procedure owners are going to put the information to us in one of two ways, if it is a minor modification procedure small changes of wording things need to be uncontroversial, we will resite the procedure with red line and strike out in the way that Jenny procedures have been prepared and circulate before the meeting. yep If the procedure owner thinks that more substantial discussions are needed then we prepare something based on model assignments paper which summarises the erm, in put so far making the proposal as a bases . Everyone happy with that? Just to confirm it is one O'clock next Monday working lunch. Is there any chance of a bigger airier room, or is it just Whenever possible I try to get a Lecture Theatre, erm but I was told it was booked all day today we were originally in presentation room then came, so be grateful we're in the Board Room. That was actually quite a productive meeting, although it took quite a time to get through it, I think we did the right thing on the continuous procedures. That will be bit of a break through as I was getting a bit despondent about them. Any note from me about progress will follow next Month's meeting not today. I agree, yep. O.K. before we pack up any other business. Erm there was I am sorry to be boring but there are all these action points from the previous meeting Oh yes I forgot the action points do you feel we have covered them. I don't know. Erm I don't think we can spend a long time considering them, it's just if people bear me whisking through them our brains. Could I also ask a question which you might be completely clear on, but I'm not, when we do back checks on files and make sure they are all up to date and so on, we come across maybe a research approval which hasn't been signed off in the right places, how far back in time do we need to get that signed off. We don't. We don't. If it's something like that erm, all will go back and check that erm the researcher in as a matter of course, a couple of months and make sure But when it comes up for the real audit, what job, is it going to encourage jobs that are audited. Old jobs you can't say don't know they will of course be We will explain our procedure and how a system is developed to be assigned, they will decide. What will happen in fact is that you'll have a start date for your system, which was basically when N1 was, and what they will be looking for is that everything from that date forward is complying right so that a job that started before then, they won't look for the initial part of that job to comply right as of that date onwards they will look for it to comply. In practice if you are back checking files and such like, if you find something that is current word which should comply and you find something that hasn't been appropriately signed or whatever, if it's easy to get it done yes do it yes, if it's not easy to get it done erm, it may be, you've got to use your judgement because I don't want you to go into a lot of work, but it may make sense to make a final note we are aware that this wasn't done correctly this person has been reminded, or In this case it's fine anyway so Well that depends on whether you are actually doing it during an audit or doing it for other reasons, what they are looking for is that your system is getting better and that you have done the right things. Well thank you. I will run as quickly as I can through the minutes of the last meeting just raising those things which still have to be actioned. Erm missing procedures we have decided that Jenny is going to write T G I, Beety will write B T and we are going to write something on access and we may need to write something on erm Health and Finance and those documents we have got in the Master File. So that's under way. Er, costing for parallel, repeat jobs, that's been dealt with by Simon erm, Client contact record I think that's now been assimilated into new procedures yes we have just talked about that er sub- contracting you have probably dealt with that, although we haven't discussed it yes er, list of procedure owners I have prepared and reissued it, I don't how wide they have circulated it, it was meant to go into the Quality Manual, and the Quality Manual is not being re-circulated until March time. I will provide a copy to Elizabeth and we will circulate it to members of this committee, together with the Ministers' meeting. Julia's definitely got a copy Yar, I think I got a copy but I just sort of filed it with all the Quality Manual stuff, as there were various different things which needed. Alan D P P forms done. Yep. All forms weeded out, get things destroyed, quality divisional quality managers. I think we've reviewed that this morning, early and we are doing quite well on forms, but do we need any further action on that? Yes we really need to do this don't we. Do the weeding yes and sorting which is really going to come from our meeting. Well can the divisional quality managers be prepared to report back on this next Monday. Well wouldn't it be better to wrap it all up in the forms meeting. Rather than take the time of the quality committee? What's this forms meeting? It isn't yet It isn't John hasn't arranged it yet. That's why it's not in my diary. I'll organise that. O.K. All of that next bit relates to the form meeting. The form's meeting and I will take along to that. So that's down to me yep? O.K. well we have dealt with that, research approval is what has changed it. is that all that was? You've done that. laughing Every so often senior level people must go to files to check that things have been correctly, you need to continue to do it,, Action Divisional Quality Managers. I'd like Elizabeth to bring that forward yep for my benefit, as I know I haven't done it and I'd like it as a prompt. You want some spot checks, half an hour a week to go and do some spot checks on that. How about that? Was that meant to be that people like me should be doing spot checks, Richard should tell people like me to do spot checks or Richard was going to do spot checks? It should be that Richard does it, though he might choose to delegate it. But the i . . Richard is responsible for seeing that it is done. Yes. Yes. In one way or another. There are two things you're trying to achieve. One is the spot checks themselves to make sure that everything is right, the other is to show the commitment to people like you that this thing's important. Active staff. So, we need to make that happen. Yeah. T G I manuals, well Jenny's working on that. Sub- contracting work, Q P19. Rita. T G I production list. Yes, to be fair Jenny came in er, on Friday to talk to me about it, but I just didn't have time, I was rushing off to a meeting so I've You carried forward that . Yeah, I, I couldn't, I just didn't have time. Er, okay, we'll carry forward Jenny . Probably in her procedure. Yes. , Q P17 changes. Yep. D T P printing need their quality manuals reference in presentation will of course be . Jenny did circulate to me, by way of saying, I've done something about this, copies of D T P quality manual and printing quality control manual. With good quality manual, one of quality control manual and and all these are is the old procedures, quite badly out, not written anything like . So really I, I thought they were a bit of a mess to be honest. Is that a manual? That's a manual. Big manuals. I don't think they are any good for the purpose myself, but maybe you've got an old version of the . The procedure circulated them as the thing that's in place. Yeah. They've been retyped and they've been called erm, procedures. Erm What? Guidelines, sorry. Guidelines. And er, they are actually a good description of what goes on in those departments and those that relate to these procedures. Could you make sure that Jenny is clearly briefed then, because she thinks, this is version N3, dated January '94. . There is some confusion there, I think, and er, I'm glad they've been retyped and issued . There's already more reason why and that's suggesting that you're saying January is inadequate. . You can have two issued in January, one is like N3 and one's N4, because you know that N4 is more reason for . So, we're going to follow up on that. Well, the issues of it. Alan, can you feed back to Jenny what the state of play is, but she also doesn't seem to have her document control particularly well organised and if you and D P, sorry D T P, re-issuing those guidelines, you shouldn't be. Jenny should be. If they are related documents to the procedures. They're controlled documents. Erm, they weren't controlled documents up until now. They weren't, okay. They're about to become .. They came out of the audit, didn't it. And out of Carolines audit . Yes, they sort of crawled out of the woodwork. Thank you, Stella. We just raised an instance of the next point of the minute. It must have been reference for Jenny to be No. They were originally procedures, you see, and then they disappeared as procedures and went nowhere. They were in, they're coming in in seven reports. Your suggestions? Like the last meeting, yes. It's not fair. Can we use things like document . As things are revised we should try to harmonise names of third level documents. We've got the department quality manuals, working guideline, we've got the quality control manual, we've got the quality manual erm, it would be nice to see if we could harmonise them. But, we could only do that from procedure levels and . That was a , wasn't it. but not accurate enough to say at this stage. it, there's no point in re-issuing perfectly good documents just to change the name on them. No. But,. But, new documents that are being prepared. I, I would suggest you need a standard name for it. Quality guidelines or just guidelines. Guidelines. Wouldn't it be whatever it is, yes. Guidelines. Dot. Dot, dot, dot, dot, guidelines. Well, can everyone take on board the idea now, if there are new documents being prepared or we get to a major re-issue . We're talking about guidelines. Yeah, in the process of . Even if they're all about quality control. Yeah. . No, just thinking of data prep. Think about guidelines. Yeah, I mean, a document that is literally about levels of verification and . . I have one question about it though, and that is ar , if you're calling them guidelines are they guidelines or are they mandatory . We could use this procedure say according to the guidelines, then it becomes mandatory. Guidelines. No, no, it becomes mandatory to follow the guidelines which are not mandatory. . I think it's important that you know. They are in the sense that I think we believe they're mandatory, don't we? . But we don't want to make it a, a potential area to fail . It, it depends on just what these things are for, because if think about a third level document as being something like the T G I manual, that's got to be mandatory, you've got no choice in it because it's not covered in procedures, it's got to be that. There are other things that may not be, so you need to think very carefully about what name you're going to call them and whether all these documents are mandatory or are advisory. Could we put on the agenda for a future meeting something called review of guidelines where the, this is exactly the issue. Yeah, so what to call them if we're going to change the name, or what we will eventually change it to, we're not going to change them now and whether they're mandatory or not and whether we need to change them to say that. For a future meeting or the next meeting. Not the next meeting. Just No, not the next meeting. February, March. February, is good. February. Training records, there is a committee in place meeting tomorrow to deal with that. Sorry, February, I think we'll be having feedback, won't we? Don't worry about it, we'll Alright. February will be good, we should it before March. We should no the answer to this before comes. Right. Er, Stella, have you taken action on Q P24? Erm, yes, we have. This is where we've come up with critical application software. Okay. I mean, you'll see it in my procedures when we, when we get See we've twice as divisional quality manager half an hour each week looking at . It's now an hour. Did I say an hour? . Oh, is it. double dose. Erm, Richard to organise our auditors to accompany Caroline next time. Okay? Yep, fine. Er, divisional quality manager should give positive feedback on divisions about this pre-assessment, the one that happened. Anything to report back on that, divisional quality managers? One divisional quality manager didn't even get positive feedback.. I think Richard gave me a copy of all . . Mine, they haven't. No, I mean, the meeting wasn't that long ago. I'm having a division meeting on . So, I'll make sure that it's more general, I mean, I talk to the directors. I'll not call a formal divisional meeting, we had that on Wednesday. Well, I went round and talked to group , but I think there's a lot of er,about keeping everything fine and up to date at all times in all places and all the rest. , it was almost the energy to manage to do it, a hundred percent of the time and a hundred percent of the occasions that they felt, I think, was a little daunting. There is still lots of goodwill and I'm sure er, they'll aim to do it but We're getting, if we could be this time next week, given feedback and come back with some response and maybe John, you can take whatever comes out of that on board in your . Er, changing needs to get signatures, that is done. Thank you very much for your help, Susannah. Er, John went around to all staff is done.. Done that. Well, actually,wasn't a reminder about the need for suggestions, so perhaps that could be included in, in the next one. I included quite clearly in my re-issue of the research approvals form er, the covering letter that went with it, saying you know, here's an example of suggestion that makes your life easier, please keep them coming. That didn't go to everybody. That only went to the It went to all procedure holders. only the nine . Call for more suggestions,, okay. Mid-January we're working on that, suggestion forms, three quality completers, I've put that in the revised list of people coming round in these minutes. Q P32, suggestions . Well, we've done that, haven't we Simon? Yeah, I think so. Matters arising from previous meetings. Version dating related documents, task not yet complete. Still not complete, but we have reviewed that and we're making good progress. Mind if I have something with it. Roy is to check on receiving inspection of testing received in . Q P4 is amended now, Simon. Q P17, Jenny has drafted and circulated. Q P28, amendment still to be done. You've done those, Simon. Yes. And issued them to date, that's fine. B M R B International reports, not yet issued. Yes, it is. Yeah, a manual. That Jenny has designed. Jenny T , don't know, 'cos it was down to Jenny D to Jenny has given me notes on, on one issue here which I must admit I haven't had a chance to read yet and it's about house style, about both manual. I'll make sure that er, I've read that and talked to Jenny in time for the next meeting so we know where we stand. So that's a cross to bring that one forward please. John , still . And? Well, she knows she's going to do them. Good. Quality jobs isn't her favourite job. Is it anybody's favourite job? She does it well though. Er, next for job descriptions to go to the quality manual. I'm sure you've got the masters in place, haven't you Elizabeth?procedure review to start in September '94 in appropriate er, Richard. Yeah. Good. Dates for '94 meeting, blah, blah, blah. Next trial audit, that's it. What an awful, that did get ticked off actually, as we went through. Well done. Sorry it was another long hard meeting but we are making good progress and I think by the end of our next one when we've revised most of the procedures we'll be well placed. Good, thank you very much.. We certainly will be today. Erm I it looks as though everybody's gone anonymous on me today. Could you please turn your name boards round so we can see who's who. Thank you very much. Er the other rule with well method of procedure, most of you know about it, but if you want to attract my attention during the course of the discussion simply put your name board up on end and we can see who wants to speak. We also yes I must remind you that we have read the papers so I don't necessarily want to go through it word by word line by line er but obviously when you want to make a point you will refer back to those papers but don't you must assume that we have read them and that everybody else has read them. Er today we're going to look at this Policy E two, the op open countryside, and there are presented to you for the discussion three matters. And the first one is, Is the policy required and if so does it give sufficient guidance. The next matter is, Is the proposed policy too restrictive and does it adequately reflect national policy guidance on the need to rural enterprise and diver diversification of the rural economy. Now obviously B does follow quite properly from A but let's start off with Mr Williamson picking up the question, Is the policy required and if so does it give everybody sufficient guidance. Mr Williams. Thank you Chairman. Ken Williamson North Yorkshire County Council. Chairman, much has been said during the course of this examination about the quality of the environment in North Yorkshire. Particular emphasis has been placed on the fact that the county embraces the best part of two national parks as well as two and a half areas of outstanding natural beauty and a heritage coast. Collectively these areas of national designation cover about forty five percent of the three thousand two hundred square miles which constitute the county of North Yorkshire. As befits their status they are the subject constructed on Policy E one which affords high priority to conservation landscapes and general amenity. The majority of the remaining seventeen hundred square miles or so of the county also comprises open countryside. Most of it's vastly populated and punctuated by well defined compact small market towns and villages. The majority of this remaining countryside is also of a high quality deserving in the County Council's view protection in the words of P P G seven for the sake of its beauty, the diversity of its landscapes, the wealth of its natural resources and its ecological, agricultural and vacational value. There is however no existing policy, control development and change across this wide countryside. This represents in our view a major gap in the strategic policy framework for such an extensive rural county and one which is becoming increasingly in need of filling. Chairman, back in nineteen eighty when the County Council's original structure plan submission was examined, the panel who subsequently the Secretary of State rejected the proposal for a policy to control development in the open countryside outside the nationally designated areas, primarily to suggest that on the grounds that the agricultural policy in the plan were equally capable of achieving the objectives sort by the proposed open countryside policy. Chairman, I think in nineteen eighty this was quite possibly true. Thirteen years on er the situation has changed and changed quite dramatically. It is no longer Government policy to retain as much agricultural land in productive use as then. At the same time new places have been exerted on the countryside almost daily. Although they were at the agricultural policies undoubtedly continue to be relevant, still have a significant part to play in many current situations. It is undoubtedly true their role and application in the nineteen nineties is significantly different from that envisaged back in nineteen eighty. County Council believes therefore that is is now appropriate to clarify the strength of the general thrust of strategic policy as regards the development of the open countryside by introducing its new Policy E two. County Council's encouraged by the fact that the introduction Policy E two is supported by all the North Yorkshire Districts and they are after all at the sharp end of implementing structure policy. It's largely on the alerting of the County Council's decided to incorporate such a policy in this alteration. County Council's similarly encouraged by the widest support inclusion of the policy has elicited, as I say at least in principle Chairman, and most of the respondents to alteration number three. I think in this context there are very few people who have actually said it is not relevant or appropriate to introduce introduce the policy at this stage. Chairman, I think I should say in proposing the proposed Policy E two it should be stressed the County Council's not seeking to introduce a policy of restraint and restriction on the development which attempts to mirror that already applying within any of the nationally designated areas. The County Council fully recognizes that this would be appropriate, inappropriate sorry, and unacceptably constraining. Nevertheless it does believe it is appropriate that the strategic thrust of the policy should be based on the premise that development proposals likely to be consid considered acceptable in the open countryside will in a sense represent the exception rather than the rule. And the early reading of P P G seven it seems to me it's apparent that the principle messages are that the development in open countryside should be strictly controlled, and I would underline that point strictly controlled, and that the countryside should be safeguarded for its own sake and non-renewable and natural resources should be afforded protection. It is I would suggest similarly evident that P P G seven expects most new development in rural areas to be directed to rural villages and small country towns and that it should be sensitively related to existing settlement patterns under the historic wildlife and landscape resources of the area. County Council believes that this advice and guidance is synonymous with the view that is taken that development of the open countryside will in fact represent the exception rather than the rule and that new development would not normally be permitted. The policy as now presented to the panel for consideration in the County Council's view therefore represents and provides a clear strategic statement covering the processes involved in changing the wide open countryside and beyond rural settlements and such areas identified for development purposes within those settlements could maybe identified in the appropriate drawn up plans. As such it is considered to pro provide an appropriate level at the strategic policy guidance within which District Councils can development their local planned policies, taking into account local circumstances and conditions and indeed the appropriate balance to be struck between the rural economy and protection of the environment. This view is supported by the District Councils who are united in their opposition for a policy incorporating more detailed guidance, particularly if it is sort to identify specific categories of exceptions likely to be considered to represent appropriate development in the countryside. Thank you Chairman. Thank you. Anyone want to pick up the ball and run with it and would question whether it is considered necessary and does it give you sufficient guidance at strategic level? Mr Donson. Thank you Chairman. Roy Donson House Builders' Federation. I would very much like to pick up the ball and run with it as to whether this policy is necessary or not. Erm we've heard from Mr Williamson that it fills a strategic gap and guidance and that pressures on the countryside are exerted daily and curiously enough it wasn't a policy of restraint or restriction. I can't agree with any of those things. The reason for bringing forward this policy was because it, as Mr Williamson said, is the District Councils felt there was a need to fill a strategic er a gap in strategic guidance. And not until this morning when erm Richmondshire cir circulated their erm evidence have I seen any example of er be given a pressure which er which is being exerted. You will remember erm er er as Mr Williamson outlined the counties covered by wholesalers and designations already protecting er the countryside. And you will recall that in relation to Policy H one that I I I submitted to table which is called from Selby District Council showing the extent of that coverage both not only national designation but also of local designation. And that showed that sixty eight percent of the county is actually covered by one form of national or local environmental restraint. But that did not include agricultural land grades one two or three A which are also covered by another policy, Policy A three. If you also take that away and you also take away land which is already covered by settlement, I would suggest that you're left with very little and so what's the strategic gap? I think I would submit that there isn't really a strategic gap. There may have been one or two planning applications which have been a little bit difficult to deal with but that's life surely. We have to make decisions, that's what planning is about coming to decisions. And that in fact what we already have in this county is a balance of policies which substantially favour environmental protection and this is just a means of adding another one which is another hurdle for any department to erm to to actually er meet. If there is if there are no er examples of er er dev individual examples of development pressure, as I say we have one apparently presented to us this morning I think one over a period er since nineteen eighty seven, it's not a basis for a policy. And you you will know as well in relation to Policy H one that it was said that if fact development housing development in particular 's kept pace more or less with the er the policy of er the the policy set out in the structure plan. The exception to that of course is York but York wouldn't be affected by this open countryside policy er at all. What I would see this policy as doing would be simply to bring an element of restraint er which er would be formulated in way in which it would within the local plans so that tight boundaries would be drawn around settlements, the rest of the land would be designated as under this policy as E two land and the debate as to whether the extent of that land was necessary or not would be negated because it would be subsumed as being there simply er meeting the strategic policy. If we contrast that er view of what will happen in future district plans with what has actually happened under the Hambleton District plan which I know you have a copy of. There in the absence of an E two policy the council has undertaken a full landscape assessment of its area outside the settlement. Now it may well be that er the Federation of Hambleton disagree about what the importance of of that landscape assessment is precisely. But nevertheless it's been done and the debate can be held under the auspices of the District Plan. We aren't prevented from having the debate and indeed in having that debate Hambleton will have to prove they've made drawn the right boundaries. We wouldn't they wouldn't be have to deal with that it was simply having a poli a blanket policy. There also seems to me to be some confusion of emphasis which which adds to my concern that in fact the Government policy talks about strict control of development away, and I emphasize the word away, from settlements. Yet this particular policy is intended and it says so in the explanatory memorandum, that it's to be once established as open count open countryside would be out immediately outside the settlements. We will fight all land which is not er part of the settlement. And it seems to me there is a grave danger that once established as open countryside and in an area in need of protection, it will be heavens only job to move that in future years. And in fact the intention would be in effect that this will in fact like greenbelt and I would point to the Harrogate District er Harrogate Rural Area Study and er that's been submitted by Harrogate Council as an example of er showing that that is the precise intention of this sort of policy. Because even in the absence of strategic guidance in the past it hasn't stopped local authorities actually bringing forward policies in their local plans. The difference is, of course, that those policies have got to be tested if each individual case appropriateness and er I I do feel that if we have a blanket policy then we won't be able to test it. You then have to ask yourself the question, If there isn't any Government, if there isn't any er local development pressure of any substance which has brought about the need for this policy, has there been some sort of quantum change in Government policy which has necessitated that we give emphasis to this particular issue. Well my view of that is that yes we do have new P P G seven which we didn't have at the time of the last structure plan alteration. But by and large that's just a further clarification of some aspects and it's not a quantum change of policy, all it did is collect together wholesalers of circulars etcetera er and and present them in a in a slightly er more concise way. But there's no, it seems to me there's no fundamental change in Government policy and if you are only bringing forward er a change in policy er to this alteration on the basis that er there was some extra P P G guidance we wouldn't just be dealing with countryside policy here we would be dealing with a policy about telecommunications, wind farms, a whole raft of things er which which we ought to be really dealing with. It may
