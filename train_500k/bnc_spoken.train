a minority of people in this county. Here, here please. Er, the debate this after er this afternoon has centred on adult views of fox hunting. Well I'd like to say that it's not only adults who have an interest in this subject and have been watching what the county council is going to do about it. At the weekend I received a letter and a petition from a young girl called Frances aged nine years old and it brought it home to me that it isn't an adult centred er erm issue, that it's one for everybody who lives in Leicestershire. Unfortunately it was received too late to go through the formal council procedure, but I do hope that you allow me to hand it to the council secretary later who it is addressed to. The letter is short and I would like to read it. It starts Dear county secretary. I am writing to you on my views of fox hunting. I was against this sport all along, but it is only now that I have read the page in the Leicester Mercury that I feel bold enough to speak out to you. Sport I agree, can be played, but I don't call fox hunting or cub hunting a sport. It is an inhuman, heartless massacre a murder, an unasked for and undeserved murder, a murder of innocent, lively, living, intelligent foxes. We have a fox that lives near us and I have spent many a night and a morning watching it frolicking and jumping about and it breaks my heart to think that many of its kind are suffering death at its worst. Imagine if you were a vixen scared and frightened, seeing her cubs destroyed. Many suffer this way yet some people don't care. Some people like and enjoy it. There are jobs around that don't involve animals. Now I talk fox hunting. Think it and dream it. In my mind I won't rest till I know that I have done something, no matter how small to bring this ban closer to a stop. I look forward to hearing your opinion on this matter. Signed Frances, aged nine. Nine And this child. That's right and that's a credit to the education system of Leicestershire. Here, here And Frances has also collected a petition of sixty four children at her school which I will also hand over to the county secretary. I think it's very clear that its fox hunting should be banned in Leicestershire. I support the motion of Councillor and Councillor . Thank you Chair. Er, before I call Mr can I compliment the council on the way that this debate has gone. A lot of people anticipated a lot of ill feel , well a lot of ill feeling being expressed. Thank you for not doing that. Thank you for the complimentary way you've acted. Mr . That's stumped my reply. Now I, I won't, I won't go for this vote because at the end of the day I I don't think it'd be er er productive, it'd be counterproductive erm, I do hope that you around the chamber tonight, do look inside and say look if you're fed up with it coming to the council Mr whatever your name is, I forget, the new guy er, it will only come back next year. Get rid of it now. Vote for our motion and go for higher places. Mr Er, I I do apologise but erm I've never known a fox yet drop a cattle, a stock, er something that big, when, when you said farmers and their cattle, their d mostly dairy farmers and all the rest of it I've never seen a fox do that. In actual fact I've got a friend and I go potholing with him, we meet, he's a Kendall farmer, he's a a sheep farmer and er, we meet and he says you know what I've got a problem with on my land, not foxes dogs and walkers that haven't got them on the leads and crows at lambing time cos they peck their eyes out and things of that calibre, he says yes, I'll tell you what I'll bet you I've had animals taken by foxes he, he says I probably have, he said but I've not had this kind of unindeighted killing as. Well, we should be able to decide before the meeting and make the changes as we go along. Yes, yes,. Yes, just how quickly but, and the people that are used to the style of how they're gonna be done. I think that's Stella's point. quite straight forward. So we probably can get another lot well before the If we're just talking about the niceties of the way these things are laid out, previous set of procedures say things like page one-o-two, page one-o-three etc, and I think that is probably good practice if you can look at a page number and so you know exactly how many pages to expect so, we can probably do that when we re-issue these procedures as well. Okay, Q P2. . Erm, if there are any changes, however minor, if er, could we make a point of re-issuing the procedure, after we've decided a change . Yes. Sorry, I haven't quite statement. If we decide er, at each point of the committee meeting I, I think we should be processing any and suggestion forms that procedure owners have received, in a reasonable time, in order for them to process it before that meeting. And any changes that we agree in that meeting, can we then re-issue those procedures immediately after the meeting, or as soon as possible after? In principal, yes. I, the only problem I have , it's not between, it's meant to be weeks. Yeah. Can you just explain how that would work though 'cos we're now erm, auditing by job, aren't we, and given I don't know the audit timetable I can't visualise the effect this would have but it seems that one could be making a change 'cos a particular, a job's been audited and it effects Q P1, or something one month, and therefore you make changes to it and another job's audited the second, another month, the second month and Q P1 needs changing again, and it, in terms of keeping our staff with us, it will be quite conf , I think it's not terribly practical to keep having constant change. Right, this is one, this is one of the things which I am not happy about, with the way in which you are running your system at the moment, and that is that you're being totally reactive. You're waiting for somebody to audit and find something wrong. If somebody comes up with a suggestion for a change to a procedure, at this meeting, yes you should be looking at what that suggestion for change is but all of you round the table should be thinking, well does that change adversely effect other jobs in our areas and it shouldn't happen that you will get change after change after change. You should be thinking beforehand, is this really right or isn't it? At the moment you're cre , you're cor ,, you're correcting your procedures on the basis of auditing and finding out what we're not doing instead of really thinking about them. Long term, what really Yes, but isn't that because we had a very, very, very long think about them and this is the first reaction to that long think. They were as good as we could make them, we felt, and we had a long think. which is first set of audits, first set of suggestion forms which have come through because a lot,standing order. I, I think what Richard, what Richard is suggesting is the very sensible way forward in the longer term, whether it makes sense right at this instant is, is another matter. I do think we've got to bear in mind that when you are looking at a change does it apply to everybody. Erm, like you had the discussion on the first one and said, well, yes, it's all very well for you and yes it's a great idea for you, but the rest of us don't want it , and I think you've got to do that. I think that so far as we've got . Money's our , we have the committee meeting, we agree changes procedures and as soon as possible we re-issue those procedures,monthly issues that . But there may be good reasons every now and then for not re-issuing er, even though it's agreed what the will be. I can't quite think what they are but I think the other possibility to take Stella's point is that if there is a change that's come up because of an audit, where a particular job has been audited and you know that within the next week or so another similar job is being audited, it may make sense to refer it 'til the next meeting, providing you're not deferring it for a long period of time, to compar the results of the two jobs. And that means looking at the audit schedule out front so that you, you're not . All that means is a general every month that we'll re-issue some procedures. Well, yes, but in the long run that it, that won't be, it will only be in the short term, when we're really honing out. Sorry, I meant monthly was an adequate frequency. Oh right, no more frequently than monthly. Right. Yes. Could we have a copy of the audit time, please. . Have you got one there? Yeah. Good. Let's move on then to Q P2. Right. Were any of your extra's about Q P2, Si? Yes, one of them is. Erm, start from the beginning. There's the quiff from Peter, which is pointing out that the letter of confirmation that we reference to because it was a repeat, so reasonably enough they're not going through all the assumptions , and he also is saying that the er, letters of confirmation that is a repeat of the previous job. Erm, a suggestion from Richard's attached. There's a suggestion here from Sarah. The application states that this procedure does not cover costings based on rate cards. We use rate cards in that excess but we still comply with the procedure which . It's perfectly reasonable to follow the procedure book and the procedure. Are there any other rate cards that might be excluded? Well no, there's the T G I rate cards but then this doesn't apply to T G I. But that's on computer? Yeah, yeah. Perhaps there's no need to 'Cos the thing about rate cards is that if the rate card is there you don't have to go and get special authorisations or , you quote them the rate card. Well, we have the same guidelines as . Okay. You wanna remove it? But you don't have a costing, you do have a costing quote form. Costing quote form. Do you have all of these other things. It, it's a case of what she's letting herself in for if we strike this out. Maybe she's not covered by this in effect. Well, I mean, we have a different costing form but we have costing forms. Where else do we have rate, rate cards, to rate card printing? Yes, I'm trying to think. Have you got a separate procedure for . Yeah. knows the separate procedure . Well, I'll have the . I'm not to keen on striking it out. if we leave it in, Sarah can still follow the procedures. It's the same if we take it out, if we take heaven knows what . Well we just established that there are areas where we're using rate cards and where we don't follow the procedure. I think Does printing follow? Printing . Printing has its own separate procedure. I think one of the problems is not taking out rate card , if you leave out, if you actually say this procedure does not cover full estimates and costs or costing based on rate cards. So, if you don't take that out, it means that effectively you're gonna have to have another procedure somewhere that's going to cover rate cards. And if they get, if they're happy to work to that. Er, we're gonna need . Contact cover the procedure. So, if we don't take this out we have to do something about . . Yes. . Good, right. Now erm, most of this is about er, repeat projects rather than new, original ones. Erm, you can read the suggestion there, two point three, two point four. My only concern is two point four. We're quite clear we have to have provisional guidelines which say with , what level of seniority is required to authorise a quotation of the values. Do we have a list of authorised researchers, that is people who are authorised to give costed clearances. Yes, each division has erm,. Right, so when in two point four it says er, a copy of the quotation must be signed by an authorised researcher. Er, someone as authorised in the divisional guidelines, yes, authorised to, checked and authorised according to divisional guidelines. Signed by an authorised researcher. That may not be by name, John. Erm, I mean, our pres , our erm, guideline is by level. By level. I know we still say that is defining levels . Okay, I just wanted to be clear we weren't finding an additional list of names of people who are authorised to do this. No. 'Cos it, for example, in support when it came to the I don't know how other people are doing the guidelines but by definition the divisional guidelines mustn't say, must define who the authorised people are, or those . Whether they do it by name or by status level or whatever else, really doesn't matter. Obviously it must define the Right, it's just that we had this issue in support of other research a questionnaire and in support key divisions, sorry, key departments have lists of named individuals who can authorise questionnaires. That's in data , data processing and, and . So, I'm just thinking that the potential across the company if you look at our system broadly and an auditor says the phrase authorised researcher, where's the list of names, they'll get an answer in one part of the company and they'll get a list of job titles in another part. No problem. . So, we agree two point four. Erm, we haven't let anyone disagree with that either. I'm not clear about the, the sentence in case a repeat costing's copy of the quotation given to the client must be signed by an authorised researcher. Is that . Copy of the letter. Oh, copy of the original letter, so if you didn't No, no, the new letter which says this'll cost, the at this time will cost you three thousand five hundred, then you've got it signed by an . quotation probably based on your previous jobs, somewhere write that down. No, you haven't. In case we repeat . No, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't arrive at a costing based on the costing quoted before. Yeah, but you've got to come up with a cost somewhere, that's got to be . Yeah, well yeah you just do that times five percent. percent, or whatever. Yeah, that's what I mean. Yes, but . That's the figure that appears in the quotation to the client. That's the only place the cost goes. Yes. I don't see a need to have it repeated on a separate bit of paper anywhere else. Right. Just . The only thing is, if in access they may never actually write this down. they always write it down. Oh, they do. Mmm. Oh, right. Well, that's all right. I mean, the difference is, I think, that if you, if the letter comes from the liaison point then the letter won't necessarily be signed by the authorised researcher but we're saying a copy of the letter is signed by the authorised researcher and put in the file. Right. Yeah. Yes. Clearly, if the person is authorised himself, the letter on its own will do it. Yeah. Completes in the first sentence needs to be in upper case. In two three. Right. . Okay two, two three, two four and two five are all accepted? Yep. Well done, good. Moving on to Q P4. . Any extras on Q P4 before we start? Erm,guidelines He's got that here. Oh, has he. Right, fine. Oh no, he's got, hang on. None of the new ones . So. . Yeah, right. There were references in the last two meetings and two quiffs from Liz and Peter erm, which I can dig out if you want me to. It's erm, as you can see, it's divisional guidelines for authorising costing needs to be and referred to under related documents rather than just divisional policy. . Yes. I think this was one of the quiffs erm, arguing that er, a proposal er, will help prepare, the letter wasn't . a letter to the constitute . I mean, it's the same project. No, that's okay. Erm, four nine, the research of formal question letter, order form or contract , to my mind, quite honestly, a purchase order form is a contract from the client but erm, the quiff seemed to think that it wasn't so, I don't know whether it's worth changing this, depends how the auditors form . The auditors picked up that we had a pink purchase order form which was neither a commissioning letter nor a contract. In my eyes it is a contract but do we need to make this change? . as we're going to make other changes anyway so Yep. And we said that where a form referred to a procedure, the procedure would refer to the form so I've added that details are completed on the research approval form. Yeah. Erm. That's details of the ? Of four point nine the date of written confirmation from or to client. Yeah. We've also got client so, we've also the client contact record sheet which is . , you don't have a enquiry, do you. You only have it once at this point on, not at this scene of the . Yes, it does, I think. Yes, I think it does. Now once question I have got on this. As I've, I mean divisional guidelines forthrising costing I've added to the related documents and I'll produce those because they're a divisional thing. Er, I've now added the research approval form and it's become a related document here but in the original allocation of forms, the responsibility for keeping this up to date was not mine. Now, are we sticking with the allocation that we had in the past, peoples responsibility, or when we change them in this sort of way are we mucking them about? 'Cos I like to know what I am responsible for and what I'm not. Yes, it decision. Presumably the original decision was, was based on the first time , it is now the first time. Yes, that's correct. Who is currently . Whoever. Jenny I think, is it? Yes. Jenny . Both are going to be difficult. It's going, if you actually think of, about this, it is going to be difficult to me to remember to change the responsibility. I would prefer that we accepted that Stella's original notes defines the responsibility for forms literally for all the time. So do I. I mean, we just, we just don't have to keep changing it and talking about it. It does mean it's no longer the case that the, that the owner of forms is the person who's first mentioned. . No, but that was just an easy way of . Yep. But we have all and we know what . Okay. Sorry, can I just. It may be me misunderstanding, but erm, are we therefore saying on this one, god which one are we on, Q P ? Four. Four. Where are we adding this bit about research approval form? At the end of four point nine. Right, so we only do it once we've got the formal, so we're not generating a research approval form for, unnecessarily? No. Right, sorry. I thought, we're only doing it once it's been commissioned. Right, okay, fine. Once it's been commissioned. Can I just make one suggestion, sorry, and that is er, in four point nine, where you've got your formal commissioning letter er, you put down order form or contract. If you take the word form out and just leave it as order, then it doesn't matter in what form it comes from the Yes Yes. Form or a letter. Yes. I mean, just going back to your point, I mean to me an order form is a contract. If we're going to put something in then let's keep it as general as possible. Yes. Any other points on Q P4. four point six you've got quotation letter and actually a lot of our quotations are actually faxes. Would that,? It's, what it comes down to is an understanding. If we're talking about outside auditors, whether it's a letter, a fax or whatever won't make any difference as they won't quibble over things like order forms and stuff. They're looking for a written documents, full stop. But, internally, you need to make sure that your auditors and your, and everyone understands the same thing. i think it is fair in that case, because we do define a proposal as we've done elsewhere as a . Good, Q P4 done. Any . No? Good. . Q P5. Are any of you extras on Q P5? Yes,. Erm, oh this is the, this is the point that erm, had Stella wrought up earlier on. The quiff erm, was about these interim field reports, suggested that no such thing existed, interim should be taken out and the rest of it should be . Er, Stella was saying we are going to have interim field reports. That's because I'm going to suggest, so we call them interim fieldwork re , interim fieldwork reports. What . And that'll be a related document. No, it won't be a related document because we don't Good. They vary. You can't have a standard one. like job descriptions. They vary and job descriptions with them. So you want them to be called interim fieldwork reports. Yes. Make sure . lower case. Does this apply to er, interim response reports Postal surveys. Postal surveys? That wasn't quiff but it's parallel. I've never done one. I don't know. I'm looking at Alan. You don't know either, presumably. Could we say Yeah, I think it applies. Let's say it applies to postal in exactly the same way. So, all I've got to do is disembowel them. And you'll need to take on more, Stella. That, when it comes to postals . Right, interim fieldwork report. Okay, fine, yep. Yeah. Right, so it's neither of those related documents. Yep. Five point ten. Five point ten. This was the thing that came up previously about er, dispatch of a report not being recorded anywhere, because of that was a compliment slip which a photocopy wasn't kept and so we erm, therefore have to have a note made on the client contact form to say it's gone. This is gonna have to be a general reminder to, a general point to all researchers because they won't know that, I'm sure. That wasn't the original, that was never briefed. No. But if we have to do that. a major new It is a major new point that if we have to prove we've sent, sent things out then that means But you make a note of that as part of your I believe it's quite an important part. Well, well, well. Nothing about training should go on er, as training people procedure should go on the notice board, shouldn't it. I think maybe with this next issue of procedures we need a separate mode going round which says highlights the key things, yeah. highlighting the key points. 'Cos otherwise everyone Everyone will . The reason for setting aside a through the request as researchers where we're actually going to go through all the procedures, highlighting , the changes are and why. Elizabeth, could you just sort of mark that in your minute, as something that if we do produce a highlight of changes, that is one that we . the first thing which is re , a really major change to peoples behaviour. It, from the requirements of the standard it does only imply where you haven't got a covering letter or anything like that with it. Yeah, that's all the time though. 'Cos all our reports probably go out with compliment slips, all our . 'Cos if you've got copies of the reports and things in the file, then that's not a problem. Where the problem arose was when there was no record of anything having been sent or what had been sent or anything. Well, what do you mean, if there's a copy of the report in the file. I mean, if there's a copy in the information office is that good enough proof that it's gone? Well, this is up to you to decide what you actually proof if you need it. This is a not unreasonable thing to have as one of our procedures remind you and ten, twenty . No, I know. Now let's move on to Q P9. I think this is the closest that we'll find. Well, I'm not quite sure that's what it's called. Is it called client contact form? Client contact record sheet. Sheet. Client contact Record sheet. Record sheet. It's not a form, it's a sheet. Is that referred . You take your , do you know that? What? Advertising campaign, you probably don't know.. Oh yes, I do. your sheet. Have you changed your sheet. Is erm, set down as a related document form there or? Kleenex Not yet, no. I was gonna say Andrex. . So, in this case I do inherit a new form, do I? No one else has got, has someone else got responsibility for client contact record sheet? No, I don't think they have. I think I have, 'cos I think it's on the erm, Q P whatever it is, document control policy records and I think that's one of mine. Oh yes, it will be and it's , it'll be in the list, the list of what should be in the master job file. . Yep. In the list. Yep. It'll be in that. Quality records? Yeah. Client contact record sheet. Now I've got a suggestion form from Sarah here with four points on it. Is this on Q P5? Is that on Q P5? It's still on five, yep. Point one; er, for access the field element is pre-booked, it's only necessary to book additional days or shifts verbally in excess of that already reserved. Will that come under the erm, when they inact continuous or would it continue as a non-standard survey? No, Ros has already argued that in most cases access is covered by a standard procedure survey. Right. So, what if it says Simon, because I wasn't paying attention. So point one does not apply to access,have to have. Yep. Well, let's carry on with, there are others here. Point two. Booking forms are used for access face to face. Erm, a schedule is used as a telephone omnibus detailing all the projects on that particular survey. So, there's an appropriate booking form for face to face which is actually in excess,. I'd say so. Well, is it oh no, no, no. Come on. Can the term er, appropriate booking form cover this thing called the schedule. Oh yes, yes. Er, oh. Call it a booking form. Form? Yes. I was just saying that's what a booking form is, a schedule isn't it? No, I mean the , the others have actually got booking form written on them. Are we gonna be changing the name of the schedule to booking form. Yes. Or booking schedule. Or booking sheet. Either that or we write a couple of variations on the end of this and we say the general access conforms to this but in their case, the other one is pre-booked,the extras and they have a booking schedule. 'Cos this says specifically in the applications, with the exception of continuous surveys. Therefore, and I think we'll all take access to something that we would . Paul, point Q does not apply to access by telephone which is what we're for. Mmm, well we don't particularly want access to exempted from the procedure. No. Which, if we car , if we call it continuous survey then it would be. I've also got points at point three and point six now. This is when erm, we need to go back and look, look at your continuous survey procedure. Yes. Which we've already talked about and there's no reason why erm, you cannot have a one pager for access. It says it works in accordance with our normal procedures except and rather than put the exceptions for access in that procedure,. This requires us going through these with toothcombs as we've frequently already got access as an exception in them. We had it on this procedure, already. It's not complete, is it? One point four. And it's coming, and from what Simon was saying, it's coming in, in other places as well. Yes, points three and point six. I think very good at going through with a toothcomb anyway and I'm sure that she could quite adequately. There's a fundamental problem in here that my definition of the continuous survey includes access. If said to me, what's a continuous survey I would put access in it. Aren't we going to . This procedure says the continuous surveys are excluded and then specifically says erm, what applies to access except this one. I think that's the aberration, isn't it? The oth , the other's don't say except continuous surveys anyway, do they? Most of them don't. Yeah, but we have got a problem with the other's, so far. This is the first where we've got a lot of problems with access. I mean, my concern here is that if you've got a procedure that's got nine points in it, and effectively we're going to go through one, two, three, five of those nine points and say either this does not apply to access or access does it differently. They're not working in accordance with that procedure. None of this really applies, if you read each of these they don't apply to access, in the real sense, do they? In the full sense that them, we're talking about. . Well, five can't apply 'cos four . it sounds to me as though we should let the, the application stand with the exception of continuous surveys. Delete this reference, point four does not apply to access by telephone, take up Carolines point that we need for access when we've got through the other continuous a brief statement which says, the project planning procedure doesn't totally apply until . If we leave Project planning. It's not a separate procedure. It's, it's a document available within access. Oh, I see. It just says , it's different. But there's a continuous procedure that says . Right, so there'll be a statement here or would that be in . There'll be a statement in the procedure that Richard is going to write on behalf of Jenny. Oh, right. Which defines a list of things which will have their own er, statement exceptions. So, if we're leaving with the exception of continuous surveys in there, where do we say er,. I thought we were gonna write So, we're going to write that in. Because those That's gonna be in the individual master job file. They're gonna be in their master job files. Any differences. But they all follow this. Virtually, I think. Fine, in that case. Then they just have somebody who says, we follow procedure of Q P5 . They don't even need to do that. If they are actually following a standard company procedure the project planning is very good monitoring. Yes, the continuous procedure only allows you the freedom to make changes if you need to. So, if you don't need to. I, I would suggest that any areas here at, as a overall statement where you said things don't apply to continuous, that those are actually taken out and that every procedure applies to everything, unless it is specifically removed and your continuous one allows you the Yes, that is reasonable now we're creating a continuous one, isn't it. I mean, that was obviously put in here at the time that we didn't have anything that covered it. Oh, that's right, yes. So, I think perhaps if you take that out and write this continuous and non-standard one, it allows you the facility for using it or not using it, depending on the project you're working on. Presumably should we therefore have something that covers quality, oh sorry no this covers it doesn't it, yeah, o.k. Richard another point Erm the only reason this is an issue that I get a cooking for as Research Process Manager anyway, as Audit Manager I need to have other booking forms, and the only booking forms and additional booking forms I need are all jobs which then got to Mrs which are the so I ask please make amendment to put Audit Manager in and I don't think we need to specify. Erm can someone make it clear to me where we ended up with Q P5, I am not sure whether we are changing the application or deleting Yes the exception both doing both your doing both yes. Is this being appraised with the exception or continuous service with the application, and we are deleting that point 4 doesn't apply to access. We will have a new procedure called Continuous and Non-Standard Surveys which says that they will follow the basic procedures, except where this doesn't make sense, and if it doesn't make sense the job will have in it's Master Job File a statement of how, it does comply with whatever it has to deal with. Now on that point, for access someone now needs to pick up and write effectively a simple this is how we project planning on access. And there may be one or two other things we work through over this meeting and the next meeting. We are close to the end of erm You should be lively signing this document. We might call it a day at the end of the assignments and take Jenny's away to recap, erm lets get to the end of the assignments first, Q P9. Where is Q P9? papers rustling This one I think we should give a little thought, because this is the one I think where oh yes this is going to get complicated because I have now been given a quiff and a few suggestion forms about it You said you didn't have the print of it, is that right? Yeah Richard's has given me Your'e still missing two? This is also one where we chase our search approval forms, and procedure. we've got quite a lot of these reports together here. It's also the one that covers You should continue this as a staff meeting with The only change that I have got here are minor things that were references from a previous meeting all the difficult stuff comes from the Quiff and the suggestion forms that I have not looked at yet, and so if you want to do that around a table because I don't know whether thats right. Can you Erm, I I just hoped to dictate to you which would cover the changes of the research approval form Well there is a list of things, list of points here, 4C does not apply to scan 5, does not apply to scan T G I questionnaire. 9 Research approval forms for relevant to T G I space. 10 does not apply to T G I Survey. The reissued so that the reissued quantitated appro.. search approval form no longer has provision for B P questionnaire approval. Continue reading first continue reading. Company survey's will not go through data prep but D P approval is critical why has this been removed from the form? Because the only job we haven't capped, is continuous and there are no procedures for continued jobs yet, and we have not yet got an ad for Kathy job and therefore no procedures were a mythical thing. However. laughing However, as we write these continuous things which we are talking about, approval for Kathy clearly is an issue permanent restructuring for each I'd suggested to Sarah it might be covered by Q P10.5 which actually says that the research approval form is signed by the researcher which she felt wasn't really enough. That was my understanding of what might be meant to cover that point. That she felt that it was really something D P actually signed off.. Well there is not for Kathy but for Kathy she thought this would be. Well they keep a record now don't they D P keep a record anyway, there is a system where D P keep their own records perhaps it would be helpful they've authorised If I just read out what I was going to suggest Simon described the new system for approvals it goes something like erm, sorry it's 9.9, all approvals are recorded on research approval forms full stop. Erm in order to simplify the approvals from Support Division, field approval is recorded on the field review form, data preparation and D P approval is recorded on data preparation schedule the name of the person giving approval, the name of the person, the names of D P's approvals are recorded on the research approval form. So obviously you just write down that Rita did it on the 10th. But Rita in her own department has got the document that she sends so the researcher doesn't have to take the bit of paper round to everybody and get their research approval form signed. That's fair enough because you get action Sorry, There's not room on the form I don't think It doesn't matter cause Rita can't D P could authorise it. I said we haven't got a procedure for Kathy I thought you were reading out the bit to All I have been saying is the things which aren't Kathy's everything else questionnaires. Now Kathy seems to me should be checked checking the assessor, just as if it was going over the telephone Well then that's just what I was just trying to think through on Kathy. Well we don't have procedures for it, we haven't written them. Sorry if you take catty as the para now, then D P aren't actually, the reason D P sent the paper questionnaire is to just double check that all the columns and everything are laid out in the correct way aren't they and then checking it for that reason, whereas they are actually doing it on something like Kathy themselves so they, there isn't the same approval going on. Someone's got to check the filters are right The does that on a Catty Questionnaire Well he does that on every questionnaire, but he still has got to get someone to double check it. Mmm, it's that element of double checking that But, I mean that D P team do a lot of work on the Catty questionnaires which doesn't really seem to be er sort of fully acknowledged at the moment. Yes, I think that as Richard said we need to agree if quality is to continue we have to write some Kathy procedures. That thats certainly With a timetable to them we are in the best place to do it now cause we're still learning we have only done three jobs, four now haven't we? erm the Kathy procedure is definitely needed. We are grinding to a halt on those aren't we? yeah We got D P 9.16, 28.32 we've still got four to do. Are any of those other one simple, what you would consider simple ones to understand? Erm, I will have to look at them They are actually. As 9 is one that obviously needs a lot of work and a lot of thought on it. I am proposing to delay 9 as a question for the next meeting Qualitators, quality control rustling paper. Erm this was the suggestions from Rita All of them seem very sensible to me. Well I have accepted adding those research review meeting. Yep. Are you, what are you going to call this form now Si Is it the qualitative review form or Erm it is an existing It's called a Qualitative Data Review form no it's called a Qualitative Research Review form so what's this in the something else. Oh I see as opposed to that which is how many groups they proceed to check. The qualitative research review form it's existed for sometime. So thats now reference and there is a project review meeting as there is a quantitative work. You have got four things sorry related documents. Four how have I got four? I've qualitative field review forms, yeah qualitative data review forms yeah qualitative research approval forms. It does exist, but it's not referenced here, but it does exist. And if it's not referenced here it may not be referenced anywhere else. Well, it needs to be Q P9 then doesn't it? Where we were just now with the research then talk about questionnaires. Called research approval forms. No there is a separate one for qualitative and it is different. Yes it has a lot it has a lot less on it, things like.. Is this document on that side do you know? What? No, I just have qualitative approvals It's not mentioned anywhere I think it ought to come up first in Q P9 doesn't it? Well can I make a suggestion that you add it all to the list of the things to discuss it is . Authorisations. Did you get that one Simon? Erm Discussion of Q P9 we need to decide when we qualitative approval form or whether it gets,business procedure Q P16. In that case we can't finalise this one until we have decided that. So I think that should be bought up. No one owns this form what we are trying to do is make sure it's ready so therefore it has an owner. It seems sensible that it goes with wherever the The qualitative procedure is aware of your design procedures. They may do a few they're not going to cut there, they will cut . Yeah but it doesn't really fit in here at all, I mean it's nothing to do with any of this. Nothing to do with any of this at all. It could come up under You see my visions for qualitative are slightly different to the four months at the moment, and I feel perhaps could exchange Q P16 for the control procedures to be a longer procedure but to have everything covering the project plan in progress monitoring through to quality control procedures for just the quality. So if you look at something like Q P5 where you have got this point qualitated, in fact a lot of the points don't actually apply to qualitated because many of the points relate to erm, D P erm,qualitative field as opposed to survey. So I do just wonder if I couldn't pick out point say 1 and 2 of Q P5 and 6 which are about booking and booking forms and confirming the commission of qualitative through to whatever is required during the run off of it and then add the quality control check and finally you have got this, the final review. So in other words qualitative, the whole of qualitative between commissioning as merit checks has an er Yes o.k. that a major review of the whole thing though. Do you want me to have a go at doing that Simon? because I have been difficult about it, if that helps you. Well that would be welcome but it's fine, and it should be down to me to do it, but you are all welcome. O.K. I'll try do a version, but it does effect on Q P 5 an Q P6 you see as well coughing. Can you and Simon liaise . coughing. Do you think that's a good idea? Yes I think it is. Could I explain one alteration on Q P16 Simon given our recent changes. We've got this erm, er, some one is going to monitor a proportion of work that you have recorded as transcripts anyway, and it will be a research director or A.D. I'm just wondering whether we can comply with this now. Er, well will you leave that to me in the re-writing of this. Sure absolutely. Q P16 we are going to move on from then, unless there are any other comments on Q P16, Rita is going to attempt to redraft and draw together material from previous procedures, and that means that adjustments of previous procedures you will be able to sign, and finalise them. Sorry, are you saying that erm we are going to delay doing anything about Q P5. I would, in that, in the light of well, actually no we don't have to . In actually physically up dating anything, I would suggest that at this point that Simon doesn't do of them until after the next meeting when we have got all the other's together as well because again they may attach things, just that you've got your information and know what's been decided and do the whole lot after the next meeting. Can't we get Monica to do the up dating ? I think it would be easier to try and draw them together so that we have got this document with the position so far, as we have a lot . It's very hard, I am finding it hard to keep up with them at the moment. Certainly we shouldn't re-issue anything until after the next meeting but erm, having the procedures we have finished with so far, in their latest form probably helpful, even if it's only you whose has the master copy Simon right so when we need some reference, we have got that chapter and verse. Monica I am sure would be quite happy to. laughing She will be ecstatic She certainly won't be. This is what worries me, if you have got too much stuff going through one person that . That's what will confuse her. But their always in version two. No there not, this is going to be an interim version between one and two, what Dot's just suggested. It's still typed as two. I it's she will type it in as two, and then you will give her the next draft and then two and then the next draft and then two, I mean there's no confusion there for her. That is extremely confusing for her, cause she has on her computer, she has various versions named in two, unless she destroys previous versions of M2 when she does this one Well she should she should overtype the correct one Which isn't what we did with M1 Well then one is a complete rewrite. But we had various versions of M1, but we didn't ever get rid of the first version, so we could, the one that Suzannah did and then the one that I changed, and then the one that the Committee changed, all exist so that we can back track what we actually did. Right. How did she with this we just need to type over it No, we do, I mean you do this just the same as any normal report, you do the first one and then you edit it and make yeah, yeah. Monica will be alright she know's what she's doing, it's just whether she has the time to do it, she would liked it if we had done this before Christmas, so that while you were away John you could have done it she had plenty of time to do it. Would we be able to do erm, just a sort of support ones and D T P if we got the masters from Monica as a standard responsibility. Yah, now she's made them out, shall we say we will take that one to share the load. If Monica gives a brief one. Press on please to Q P 28. papers turning I don't think I've got anything new on this so all of this comes out of B T 7, and this is all to do with Stella's original paper about who had responsibility for forms and so on. Any problems with these proposals. Seem perfectly sensible to me. Accepted. Right then number 32, Q P32 Erm we are renumbering some points in that one, erm we were trying to avoid it before but I can't seem any way of avoiding it here because these are major new things. Then there's the new additions I'm sorry about that. papers turning The proposals on Q P 32 actually reflects erm, the decision we made earlier on my, my proposal about suggestion of whose responsible for . Sorry. Well I think points 6 to 7 are to the procedure owner who communicates what action and under responsibility both points it's actually procedure only and not divisional quality manager. That would be o.k. if the only suggestions allowed were suggestions about procedures. We have just agreed that we would allow suggestions about procedures and other suggestions about the way the Company is run. They are often the same person or principal it could be either in divisional quality manager or procedure Just a change of how we would suggestion box unless So maybe Simon a brief statement in the application yep would clarify. Well. we decided that we didn't need to change the application I suggested that. This procedure describes how suggestions for improvements to systems and procedures are generated. Well in that case how about on method point 1 suggestions for improvements we need the word 'two procedures'. yes yes suggestions for improvements yes suggested to for improvements to procedures. Well I suppose we've got to reissue it anyway so we might as well. Yeah, yeah. Good. I propose Elizabeth that you circulate Jenny's reprocedures to everyone but we don't know with them, that we will read them prior to the next meeting and agree them at the meeting papers turning I have got to assess papers turning take one. Take one of those, I've taken one, take loads of copies Three procedures coming out I thought I was getting it already anyway laughing scattering the whole process . Can we just agree one final bit of detail before we pack in, there are a number of procedures now either which we be re- prepared as the basis of today's discussions, we have only got two, have we, is there just two? three three 17 18 and 21 21, I've got 17 18 21 is choices, it was the first one to come round. Don't try to blame me. Bottom pile in choices if you can send it back. Are there any spares to erm oh yeah thank you, Suggestions, in preparation for the next meeting, for those procedures that we still have to review, the procedure owners are going to put the information to us in one of two ways, if it is a minor modification procedure small changes of wording things need to be uncontroversial, we will resite the procedure with red line and strike out in the way that Jenny procedures have been prepared and circulate before the meeting. yep If the procedure owner thinks that more substantial discussions are needed then we prepare something based on model assignments paper which summarises the erm, in put so far making the proposal as a bases . Everyone happy with that? Just to confirm it is one O'clock next Monday working lunch. Is there any chance of a bigger airier room, or is it just Whenever possible I try to get a Lecture Theatre, erm but I was told it was booked all day today we were originally in presentation room then came, so be grateful we're in the Board Room. That was actually quite a productive meeting, although it took quite a time to get through it, I think we did the right thing on the continuous procedures. That will be bit of a break through as I was getting a bit despondent about them. Any note from me about progress will follow next Month's meeting not today. I agree, yep. O.K. before we pack up any other business. Erm there was I am sorry to be boring but there are all these action points from the previous meeting Oh yes I forgot the action points do you feel we have covered them. I don't know. Erm I don't think we can spend a long time considering them, it's just if people bear me whisking through them our brains. Could I also ask a question which you might be completely clear on, but I'm not, when we do back checks on files and make sure they are all up to date and so on, we come across maybe a research approval which hasn't been signed off in the right places, how far back in time do we need to get that signed off. We don't. We don't. If it's something like that erm, all will go back and check that erm the researcher in as a matter of course, a couple of months and make sure But when it comes up for the real audit, what job, is it going to encourage jobs that are audited. Old jobs you can't say don't know they will of course be We will explain our procedure and how a system is developed to be assigned, they will decide. What will happen in fact is that you'll have a start date for your system, which was basically when N1 was, and what they will be looking for is that everything from that date forward is complying right so that a job that started before then, they won't look for the initial part of that job to comply right as of that date onwards they will look for it to comply. In practice if you are back checking files and such like, if you find something that is current word which should comply and you find something that hasn't been appropriately signed or whatever, if it's easy to get it done yes do it yes, if it's not easy to get it done erm, it may be, you've got to use your judgement because I don't want you to go into a lot of work, but it may make sense to make a final note we are aware that this wasn't done correctly this person has been reminded, or In this case it's fine anyway so Well that depends on whether you are actually doing it during an audit or doing it for other reasons, what they are looking for is that your system is getting better and that you have done the right things. Well thank you. I will run as quickly as I can through the minutes of the last meeting just raising those things which still have to be actioned. Erm missing procedures we have decided that Jenny is going to write T G I, Beety will write B T and we are going to write something on access and we may need to write something on erm Health and Finance and those documents we have got in the Master File. So that's under way. Er, costing for parallel, repeat jobs, that's been dealt with by Simon erm, Client contact record I think that's now been assimilated into new procedures yes we have just talked about that er sub- contracting you have probably dealt with that, although we haven't discussed it yes er, list of procedure owners I have prepared and reissued it, I don't how wide they have circulated it, it was meant to go into the Quality Manual, and the Quality Manual is not being re-circulated until March time. I will provide a copy to Elizabeth and we will circulate it to members of this committee, together with the Ministers' meeting. Julia's definitely got a copy Yar, I think I got a copy but I just sort of filed it with all the Quality Manual stuff, as there were various different things which needed. Alan D P P forms done. Yep. All forms weeded out, get things destroyed, quality divisional quality managers. I think we've reviewed that this morning, early and we are doing quite well on forms, but do we need any further action on that? Yes we really need to do this don't we. Do the weeding yes and sorting which is really going to come from our meeting. Well can the divisional quality managers be prepared to report back on this next Monday. Well wouldn't it be better to wrap it all up in the forms meeting. Rather than take the time of the quality committee? What's this forms meeting? It isn't yet It isn't John hasn't arranged it yet. That's why it's not in my diary. I'll organise that. O.K. All of that next bit relates to the form meeting. The form's meeting and I will take along to that. So that's down to me yep? O.K. well we have dealt with that, research approval is what has changed it. is that all that was? You've done that. laughing Every so often senior level people must go to files to check that things have been correctly, you need to continue to do it,, Action Divisional Quality Managers. I'd like Elizabeth to bring that forward yep for my benefit, as I know I haven't done it and I'd like it as a prompt. You want some spot checks, half an hour a week to go and do some spot checks on that. How about that? Was that meant to be that people like me should be doing spot checks, Richard should tell people like me to do spot checks or Richard was going to do spot checks? It should be that Richard does it, though he might choose to delegate it. But the i . . Richard is responsible for seeing that it is done. Yes. Yes. In one way or another. There are two things you're trying to achieve. One is the spot checks themselves to make sure that everything is right, the other is to show the commitment to people like you that this thing's important. Active staff. So, we need to make that happen. Yeah. T G I manuals, well Jenny's working on that. Sub- contracting work, Q P19. Rita. T G I production list. Yes, to be fair Jenny came in er, on Friday to talk to me about it, but I just didn't have time, I was rushing off to a needs of potential developers and investors. And I think we did draw attention to the fact that er there may well in some instances be a conflict in terms of what Selby district wants and what current P P G advice suggests. But then when you refer back to the original restraint imposed by the erm existing policy. So yeah I'm sli slightly concerned in that respect. I thought you might be with that answer yes. Mr Earle. Thank you Chairman. Erm the the particular case of Richmondshire having been referred to I I felt I ought to point that er we're quite content with the concept of Policy E two as giving the strategic weight to the question of protecting the open countryside and the balance, the very difficult balance, decisions that we and other authorities are going to have to come to in preparing our local plan. We're quite content that we're going to have to er put before the local plan system the the countervailing issues and the weight that's given to the countryside through E two is appropriate in the circumstances. Thank you. Any comment. Ah Mr Feist. Thank you Chairman. Michael Feist Countryside Commission. A lot of the dis discussion has clearly been erm trying to resolve some of the ambiguities in P P G seven er and I think perhaps different perception to what sort of countryside in North Yorkshire we are trying to safeguard through through policies. Er on one side there seems to be a feeling that there should be no development and it would compromise the character of open countryside. And on the other there seems to be a view that, well, erm wherever necessary perhaps on a farm or elsewhere that development should be should be permitted. And the consequences of a latter approach could lead to accumulative change in the appearance and nature and character of the countryside so that you get something rather different than most people's perception of a countryside being there for its own sake. And I think that whereas erm we would not necessarily argue with a case for providing criteria at a strategic plan at a structure plan level erm to put some flesh on what is meant and maybe clarify some of the explanatory memorandum in a more positive way, simply should ensure that the policy does not dilute, sorry that whatever changes emerge, does not dilute the mode intention of the policy. And that the district should be given some form of a guide that enables them to be er to apply the particular circumstances to their own district. There may be some districts that have er areas of countryside which are outside the non- designated areas which they regard as particularly important as erm the gentleman from Selby has said, er and the we have suggested that er there might be a criteria in the policy that allows the quality of the countryside affected by development to be a consideration. In other words, erm that er special landscape areas countryside is not to change quite radically. If there is a decision at the structure plan level that the countryside should be enabled to change quite radically in North Yorkshire that would be a different matter. But nothing I've heard today Chairman suggests that is the case. Thank you. Mr Williamson is there anything you want to come back on or you feel you've had enough in terms of summing up on matters A and B? Yes I was proposing we close for lunch. Reconvene at two and then go straight into matter C which is the next section. Yes thank you er thank you Chairman. Erm I think probably yes the debate has been probably as extensive as it needs to be. Erm I'm not sure whether there's an abiding need to to actually bring it all back together again in in the context of a summary. I think the the county council's made its position fairly clear, hopefully particularly clear. I don't think er my only comment would be that having heard all the comments that have been made and listened to them and tried to dissect them and understand them, I don't think they really alter er fundamentally our position. Thank you. So we'll reconvene at two. Were you dying to say something Mr Rudd? Julian Rudd Ryedale District Council. About time I put an opinion I think. Erm just three perspectives from a district level on on matters that have been raised. First of all erm Ryedale District isn't saying that the policy is warranted because North Yorkshire is in any unusual regardless of the quality of the countryside here, but that this is a reasonable reflection of national policy on development in the open countryside. Secondly, that I think Ryedale was under the impression that Policy E two wouldn't affect local authorities' choice of allocated sites but that it was a policy to apply outside of developing units and those sites we wish to allocate in local plan and not that was going to restrict our choice, in our case in those sites. And thirdly, with regard to Mr Donson's concern erm I don't feel that the policy precludes the provision of low cost housing on exception sites, er certainly hope it doesn't. Erm however, if it could be made clear perhaps with an extra paragraph in the explanatory memorandum that I would welcome that. Thank you. Succinctly put. Can we come back at two and go straight into matter C, major exceptions. eighty nine, I mean nine ninety one. I'm ninety one, And and I'm born the last day in April. And whereabouts were you born? On Street. And er, could you tell me a little bit about your family? What did your father do for a living? Me father was a showman. And how did he come to be that? He went to er College, and he used to wear a mortar board, cos that's the tassel hanging down, and this here thing. And me mother, she lived at , that's not far from Peterborough, and she er Me father used to go to this here farm, me mother lived, and of course they got in with each other, then they got married and then they wanted to buy a caravan. He wanted to be a gypsy, what they used to called them, then. And er on the road. He used to go to Goose Fair, and all the fairs, whatever they was, but it was only for three days. Did you do a lot of travelling around the country ? Oh , miles,mil Never stop anywhere, only three days, so we got no time for anything. So what about your schooling, then? Schooling? Well to tell you the truth, I went to own school, when it was er winter, when it comes the winter, they bate somewhere for the winter, do you see? And I went there for a little bit, and then we moved on, moved off from there, do you see? And er when I did go to school, er all the bottom of er Mill there used to be all sand banks, and me and the other girl, we we came from this school, to look at this here man with a bear, a big bear. He'd got a pole, with a bear dancing round it. And I know the little tune, what he danced to,tiddly-om-pom-pom, tiddly-om-pom-pom,,tiddly-om-pom-pom . And another with a German band, he'd got everything on him. And you know what that tune was? Dee- da-dee-da, la, la, la, tiddle-diddle-liddle-liddle, da ah ah . I don't kn And can you tell me a bit about your mother, did she ever work, at all? Well she Me mother, she worked, she had to work. Everybody had to work, and them show people could take a er big machine down and put them up. Do you see ? ? Everybody'd got to work, and know and something. Everybody. And did you have many other brothers and sisters? Mm? Did you have many other brothers and sisters? Well, they had about twenty. And y all involved in doing the show-work ? Ch eh, everybody'd got to do something. On yes. What what did you do then? Pardon? What did you do? How did you help out? Well, I was like the rest, I'd got to help out standing at the stalls, like . Roll up my lads, roll up my lads. Come on, . my duck, try your luck. Come on you, try your luck. Eh, that's a good lad. Hit him at top of his head. See? And all that kind of thing.. And what what stalls did yo ? Eh? What stall did you have? What had er boats, we had hoopla, and er a coconut shy,, what you call it. Now what did we use to say to that? I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts, they're all standing in a row, big ones, small ones, one's as a big as head, oh give a twist,of the wrist,the showman said. I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts Roll up my lad, roll up. Penny a ball, penny a ball. Roll .. Erm d so what el Did you go to church at all, or anything like that? Oh, I went to church, oh yes. And we used to have a little card, when we went to church we'd got put a little star, in the squares, and if we didn't go we got a good hiding. See? So we'd got to take the card and show her the Mother, we'd been. Now erm let's see, now you know at er bottom of Lane here? On the opposite side, on the l on the left left hand side? All fields. Where where am I? D down there, all fields they were. And on this side, erm corn, cornfields. And er that ain't been long been built on, that hadn't, nineteen er twenty nine those houses were built, do you see? And er let's see, oh and here in Street, there used to be a little. And at the corner there was a , and at the back of that , this , there was a little pub. You used to have to go down three steps, and they used to fetch the beer in a jug. Then it er it er came on Lane, do you see? Take it off, again . Now er Now could you tell me a little bit about your school life? Do you remember any teachers? Well I don't li er I was in one class each time I went. I never got out that number one class , you see? But I could do it, I could do me sums and everything, but er I never always in number one class. Wherever I went, I went school, I was in number one class, do you see? But I should have got higher if I'd been stopping. Do you remember any teachers? Pardon? Do you remember any teachers? Ah, only Miss , and Miss , and I can't remember the others. I remember going to 's school, and er they put in front of us, I were very young, put in front of us a lot of s colours, cottons. So when it had come playtime I went home. I said, They've put this here for me to eat, Mam, and I'm not going to eat cotton. She said, Well, you're not going there any more. So, we when packed off and went somewhere else, do you see? That's how it was, I never went to school proper. And did you have any other friends? Did you have any friends from school or any friends from your neighbourhood? We didn't stop for neighbourhood, we used to be , it was r everybody mixed up. So how did you make any friends? Through the through the show people? Oh yes, mhm. We er You always made friends with people, could talk to people and if they want to miserable they can be miserable, you'd got to tell them a tale, whether you know it or not. See? And that's my trouble,i it comes out like that? Mm. Did you remember of the things you did with your friends? Any things you did when you played? Any games? Hopscotch, when we'd got a pavement, we'd more fields than er pavements . . And we used to have er we used to have some donkeys, and we used to have to get those ticked. Push them along, you know? And er horses Oh I could saddle a horse and r I can ride a horse,no not racing horses, you know, but I can just ride them. We used my sister used to shove me one side, my Dad used to say to her, Go fetch them horses, out the field. She says, Alright. So my sisters er When we was coming down the lanes, now them country lanes, weren't all done nice, they were grass, where the carts used to come through. And I used to like the gates, where because sit on it, get on the gate and get on the horse's back. You see? And er I remembering Dad, once he bought a cherry tree, and went up to get all these here cherries off the trees, and when we got them we used to wipe them and put them in a bag, and sell them at the fairs. Do you see? Er a coconut, erm brandy snap, and all that kind of things. And we used to have skittles, and what you'd got to do, for skittles you got to throw to knock them down, do you see? I used to have to shove them up, they used to get knocked s , if they won, a few little ducks, you see? And er So how old were you when y you left school? Or wh wh when you started working Oh. proper? Let's see, you ain't got it on here. Ah, I'd be er, when I left school? I don't know. What was your first job? Well me first job was d er down lace market, and I worked in Street, Hill, and at the back there was all lodging houses, do you see? And at dinnertime we used to look through this window and we could see all the lodging houses, and under the beds You could see them in bed. And under the bed there was a basket, and we used to see the chap come down and wash these, what was in the mass it was kippers, and conga eel. It's true. Then they used to come down the street, I've got some lovely conga eels, stinks a bit, but not a deal. They're awful, the were what was under the bed. And then I used to have t er a wicker basket with three wheels on, taking parcels to different firms.

She said, Can't afford it, can you? She says, Can't. So you sup up, and have another whisky.. What were your bosses like? Eh? What were your bosses like at work? Oh, they were alright. Now I remember the boss Mr , oh won't tell you his name. Er well his Mr and Miss er n forgot her name, but I do remember that when the Titanic went down, these two persons, well they were going away together. See? But they got down.

And then it went down there, and then it was er er a registerer , and then the vicar come from this place, here, down to that one. You see? And er just round the corner on Street,, there were two two houses, that was a prison. There.

And er she says, Where did you get that money from? I said I saved it Mam. She says You're a very good girl, she says Now will yo we shall have a nice Sunday dinner, you see?

I'm us I were used to selling things.. And what type of thing? How did you? What type of food did you buy, because it must have been difficult stretching your money out? Well, to tell you truth, up Deadman's Street, there used to be a big er meat shop, and we used threepenny wrap up, we used to get two chops, piece of liver, three pieces of sausages, for that, threepenny wrap up. And did you used to make cheap And we used to get the fish flaps, but nobody else would have them, you know? Two pairs of flaps. Er how many children did you have? Ten. I've got six living. I've got four sons and two daughters. And there's Ho ? three on them, on the pension.. Ho ? How did you manage to look after them on such a small wage? Oh, I looked after them. I used to wash at night, and get them all dry, get up in the night, iron them, and take them to the pawn shop. Did you have to take a lot to the pawn shop?. They used to take flat irons, women's corsets, or anything. And if you'd got a good suit, you'd take that, then fetch it out for the weekend, so they'd looked decent, and when you took it back on Monday and he said I'll have to drop you on that, Ah, so you won't this week. You see? This d That's true, my duck. Yeah. Now, what about at home,h how did you do your cooking? What did you cook on? Fire. And I lived in a back-to-back houses, and concrete floors, no no carpets on. that them back-to-back and on Saturday night were the , when our mother, when they used to go out. Next door, they'd got a lot of kids and they used to play marbles, and they used to bounce on these concrete floors. And if they'd had a row, you could hear him. I wouldn't half . And was used to have to er I'm talking about on the Green, now, we used to have to go er right out the gate, half way up the street, for water and the lavatory, it was hard to pull up. And you'd got to take a knife, in one hand paper in the other paper in the other for business.. Well, must have been hard doing your washing, then. What Well we did it. your washing. We did it. Oh aye, boil them on the fire, oh aye, we . I always kept the kids cleaned. And can you think of any ways you you managed to spin your money out? Well, when I went to live at , the kids are growing up, do you see? And er one of the daughters used to work at Lane, Ah, that's it. Lane. Now,tha this place at Lane, they used to make typewriting machines, and that. And she'd got to say whoever er work for least money, got the job. Now they used to call er black sheep, Players, angels. But the other place, Barlop, er anybody who worked for less, they did. While we were bad off she had to take that job, my eldest daughter. And when she come back, her had were covered in splinters with er bits of stuff of the machine. But she left there and got another job in. And er the other daughter, when we lived up , she had to go there for six er , and I used to ge had to get up, and bring her right down the lane, and then I'd got to walk back, up that lane meself, you see? I'm still here. Well, thanks very Eh? much Mrs , Eh? Thanks very much. . I ain't bore We've got a hearing coming up on the sixteenth of July in Yeah. in Norwich or wherever it is. Erm we've sent all the paperworks down to er an agent there and we've still not heard from the other solicitors as to what this erm Mm. thing is but I'm pretty sure I can identify it Yeah. from the stuff that's now been introduced to us. Cos there is there appears to have been a display kitchen at some stage. So I gathered after Mr and Mrs were . Yeah. Erm just track the letter down where he said that. between February and March nineteen ninety. Two five eight nine seven two in which exactly er the amount that was Yeah. . Now I can't identify what these numbers mean but I think it relates to Mm. erm a display kitchen. It it says display account . Yeah. Erm creative cuisine, kitchen-wise . But i this was actually addressed to erm the Mansfield address. Yeah. So maybe that's why it's not come to light before. Erm I presume that the s are right in saying that this this relates to the display account at at Newark . Mhm. Yeah. I mean I dunno whether you whether you you may want to Well well I I as I er as both myself and my wife understood it, everything had been paid and then obviously when we got the letter saying we owed this amount of money it didn't come to light till Mr and Mrs came to see you and said yeah. Yeah. But they discrepancies on their side as well with credits owed and all. I mean I had nothing at all to do with t' business except I went in partnership with me wife and that. Right. So er obviously I didn't know anything about the money owed or we would've endeavoured to pay it off straight away when we went to the bank er originally when it went when it folded. Right. Erm there's two points really. First of all you've got to be satisfied that that actually relates to the unit that was at at Newark. Mm. And as I say the curiosity is that it it was actually addressed to Mansfield. Erm I don't represent Mr and Mrs as you know, although they've been in to give us a witness statement. Mm. Erm you're fairly Are you're fairly confident that they're not telling us a porky about this? Well I honestly don't know. We've had erm I wouldn't say a fall out but er we're on frosty terms to say the least. Right. This is doing me no good at all whereas it seems to be all me and my wife it's but like we went to court, Mr and Mrs who were equally involved in it Sure. are not, you know, haven't been petitioned or anything. Don't worry, I've told the solicitors that are appearing for us on the sixteenth of July that that's the situation, that the have not joined in all of the partners Mm. joined in too and that they they really ought to be invited to put the s in the frame as well. Erm so I think this hearing on the sixteenth of July will be quite useful in trying to be able to i identify that this display unit relates to Newark and not to Mansfield. Yeah. Assuming for the moment that is right then obviously that sum is is outstanding Yeah. er and to avoid racking up costs which is a thing that worries me That that's what I come to see ya yeah. erm I think that some sort of offer ought to be made. Now we we've got these suggestions that you have problems with late the later deliveries from Mm. which created inconvenience at the least and expense in you having to buy units from elsewhere customs. Er if we're doing the job properly as I said to you before we really need the invoices for various Mm. customers and how much it's actually cost you to put the jobs right. Erm but taking a very broad approach to it it may be that we can suggest to the receivers of that erm taking the inconvenience, the extra cost and so on, roughly say half of that account erm Mm. can be wiped out. Er and and just going through my mind at the moment Is that like settling out of court cos that's On yes I would settle for that. Oh yes. As you know I mean I'm only a working man Yeah. wi not an extortionate amount of wages and we've just had this two hundred pound for the to be transferred to Mansfield. Sorry what's that? Erm well I bought in two hundred pound on account for my cost to you and then Oh yes I'm sorry, yeah that's right Had a letter Yeah this weekend for another two hundred pound for if I get it right is it to fetch it over to Mansfield or their newsagents over in Norwich and Yeah yeah obviously you don't want to pay us to travel over there No So erm I'm just throwing this out as an idea that we perhaps we offer one half of this amount here Yeah. erm each side to pay its own costs Yeah. and we get the s to pay half of the half. Yeah. Well if worst comes to worst and they don't accept that Aha. speaking on my own for my own personal point of view erm if they if they insist they want this full amount Yeah. would it be possible for me to pay my half of that and the s pay the other half because I'm not i it it's really started to worry me and concern me a lot I'm now I'm sure that's right and includes a lot of interest as well That's right yeah building up every day really. I mean The object as far as I'm concerned is to try and kill it as quickly Yeah. as we can cos of the cost side erm I'm not happy about the way they've drawn up the writ because it doesn't say precisely wh it doesn't say what that invoice says it's only No. because we've done some digging around that we've actually got that information Mm. it doesn't say it it was at Newark erm and I think you've got reasonable prospects of knocking it back because of the problems you had with towards the end. So I think you know erm we've got no proof they were labelled deliveries or customers complaints or Er I mean the interest is one thousand one hundred quid so Yeah. we're talking about three six aren't you at the end of the day that's what they're trying to apply for. Erm I'll start on the basis that we offer one two fifty. Yeah. What I want to do is clear that with Mr and Mrs as well pay half of that Yeah. I think So does that sound okay to you? It sounds very good yeah But you're saying anywhere between those two figures personally you will pay half of the two thousand five hundred and eighty nine Just to finish it off yeah. I mean if they insist they want all that I mean I'll if they insist they want the interest as well then I'm in er a bit of a spot Yeah. Okay leave it with me. I'll er telephone them possibly I'll telephone them tomorrow and see whether we can sort something out. Thanks a lot them Mr . Okay I'll be in touch . I feel a little bit better at least. Yeah. Thank you anyway. Alright. Cheerio then . Ta-ta. Er shall I pop in tomorrow with the two hundred pound for Norwich then? Er yes if you wouldn't mind. Okay then. It may be that we don't have to use all of that. Obviously you'll get a refund if I can solve Yeah. this fairly quickly. Okay then Mr . Thanks a lot. Alright. Cheerio. Bye. up and call me now A little music as well we have on the show we have a video from Elvis to give away in the second half of the programme and star guest this afternoon is Mary Whitehouse. Oh ho ho Steeley Dan and erm reeling reeling out the thingummybobs. Hello that's a nice way to start it isn't it? Good morning good afternoon whatever you like to call O never mind you know the number. Now er we're going to start this morning talking about animals. More specifically why we're so cruel to them. Britain must be an animal erm a country of animal abusers looking at the statistics. Why do we hate animals so much? If you have a view on that O nine O four six four one six four one and I'd like to hear from you all you have to do is pick up the phone and give me a f a call now sorry. Did Karen say to somebody on that thing did I hear her say, What are you on? She looked at me and said that when I walked in this morning. What are you on? I didn't like to tell her is was Phylisan but there we are. Anyway erm we've been hearing on this programme recently of course that er people are against hunting against fishing er they say it's cruel. But they are willing quite willing apparently to give and receive pets as presents and millions of them end up getting abused neglected and destroyed. Every year we see that doleful little puppy on the television screen and every year thousands of people give pets for Christmas. The R S P C A have to pick up the pieces and they've launched a campaign to try and stop it and joining me now is Alan. Is this Alan Oritt, Alan? Correct yeah. OK you're the Superintendent for the north east of England that covers this area too. I'm the Chief Superintendent that covers the the north east of England yes. OK. So you're the big boss are you? One of them. One of them. Have you er polished your brass today got it all ready to talk to me I hope you have. Now sorry Alan I've got to turn you up a bit you don't mind do you? No not at all. It won't hurt there we are that's nice OK. Now Alan, first of all er have we learned anything do you think over the years or do we seem to be getting worse? Sadly the things seem to be getting worse. Er we the Society try our very best to get over the message to people just before Christmas. Please don't give a pet for Christmas. But unfortunately er it seems to fall on many deaf ears and we the Society as other many charities who deal with animals are left to pick up the pieces. Why is it it seems to me also, and I may be totally wrong here, but it seems people who are least likely to look after themselves are the ones who want to have animals? I mean you see them walking around particularly people who go for the big dogs, you see them walking around with a big thick necks, the tattoos, the er the boots and the jeans rolled up. Well I think that's a little bit to do with a bit of macho image. Erm and er perhaps it's the owners wanting to look rather big. Unfortunately they don't think before they get the pet that you've got to look after it. It takes But an an time it takes money. Another thing is of course it's all pets it isn't just dogs and cats. That's right yes. I mean people have er er budgie or er er er another sort of bird and they think it doesn't need any looking after. That's right. Er just before Christmas you see people think that buying a Christmas present er that's easy. Once you've er got over the newness of it the the the thing can be put in away in a drawer can be put back in it's box. But with an animal it's for life. Er you've got to look after it. You've got to devote a lot of time to the care and attention that it requires. I I heard the other day what I thought was one of the best advertisements not to have an animal for Christmas very emotive, er I think it was for the R S P C A, and I I'm told I don't think you've heard it but it b basically it's it's er the sound of a er well it's a human pretending to be a dog really and saying you know, Well this is nice my my er family have taken me to the vet, I didn't think I was ill but never mind. Oh here comes a nice man with er an injection. Ah perhaps they're going to give me some vitamins. Yes. And it goes on and on like this until the voice is erm, I can't feel anything any more. Yes it's it's it was one of the er advertisements or programmes that went out on radio er again this is why I've been trying to get over to people the sad things that have to happen to animals. Erm we hate putting animals to sleep. In fact it was the Society's policy now that we won't put animals to sleep unless there is an extreme er cause for that the sick, diseased. Erm and we're attempting to try to get over to people please please think before you get a pet. Why is it that in the north of England, particularly in this region of the north of England, we seem to be worse than anywhere else? I I don't think you are. Now I've spent seventeen years in Hartlepool and yes that er They hate monkeys in Hartlepool did you know that? Found a honkey they monkey I wasn't going to say anything the Kirkham Hotel. they hung it. Er yes and there's one hanging behind their door. Er the thing is that the people in the northeast yes er there is a lot more work done up there by the Society but you know since I've been down in Horsham I have found that the northeast is not alone. There are many other areas in the country where animals are seriously abused. The northeast isn't the only place. Mm. Ok thank you very much indeed er Chief Superintendent. And Pa Pat I don't think I don't hold out any hope at all that people will pay any attention they will go they'll see a little puppy somewhere they'll say, Oh that's lovely we'll buy that for Tommy er, and then Tommy will abuse it totally and er they'll say, Well the dog was a a waste of time it didn't work properly and er didn't know how to er how to look after itself. May I just say that the majority of people will care for their animals but it is those people who buy, we have s er cases where erm people will turn up on Christmas day and say to their elderly relative, We bought you a puppy. The elderly relative hadn't didn't want a puppy. Never ever wanted a puppy because it makes them a captive person Mm. they've got to look after something. And this is where the Society is called in er to look after that puppy. Or just after Christmas usually between Christmas and New Year. We're called to waste ground, behind pet shops, a any place to pick up boxes of unwanted puppies, kittens that have obviously been er planned for selling to people er before Christmas. Good Alan thank you very much indeed. You're very welcome. Let er let's hope it'll mm won't be like that er mm this er this year. Now he says deep intake of breath don't have a puppy for Christmas. Do as I do have turkey instead. I'm playing this one because I like it. It's a little a little fresh Cajun music from New Orleans from the and I can say that er that's why I'm playing it really. O nine O four six four one six four one any calls about dogs or er any other sort of animal you want to give us a ring call us now. which er er probably rude I dunno it's just . Er B B C radio York you are not in the South of France but as it is persistently snowing around the county at the moment I thought you know a little French flavour. Was it the Beaujolais Nouveau wasn't it this week was it? Everybody seems to be nodding around here I thought it was Thursday it was wasn't it? Could anybody bring us a bottle down here you know because that would be nice wouldn't it on a on a cool Saturday afternoon here as we sit overlooking the grand metropolis of York. It would be nice to have just a little swig of the erm of the new grape. Has anybody tasted it? I haven't tasted it anybody taste give me a call. I cos quite frankly I have never heard such an exciting R S P C A man as that last one so I don't expect to get much response to that. Er so let's talk about the, can't hear can he he's not up in this area? No he doesn't know does he? Er stuff it. Ah anyway so erm I don't think anybody's bothered about er fish and chips arrived have they? Everybody's in there. Thing about this programme it is so it is so crucial to everything that goes on at Radio York while it is happening, they eat in the other room that's how much er interest there is they eat in the other room. Tour buses around York. Should they be banned? Should we get rid of them? Is York a big enough city to have them? You know the open topped buses where they go round they hold up the traffic. I know the tourists are very important to York but for goodness sake it isn't a huge city can't they walk round? Why can't they walk round? I think if we got rid of all those open topped tour buses in York, traffic would be a lot easier. What do you think? Give me a call you know the number O nine O four six four one six four one. You can ring now. You can ring about anything you want actually. Anything you feel like you can ring I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm really you know. Shame of the Killer oh no I don't think we'll do that er look through the Sun see if there's anything interesting erm in there I've got nothing in the Ewbank . Boxer Chris Ewbank worth around eight million is moaning that he's got no money. What has he done with his money? What has got he didn't give me any. Oh he's bought a big house has he? OK. Usual sort of sex, drugs, rock and roll as you get in the papers on a Saturday as well. Or is he the best dress man too? Chris Ewbank is the best dressed man. That'll upset Jonathan Ross he always thought he was. Er O nine O four six four one six four one. Anybody who can hum by the way the er theme to the television programme Ivanhoe and I would be interested to hear from you as well. Now as the United Nations doesn't have enough on its plate dealing with the problems on earth and obviously they're er they're there at the forefront of everything that happens . Action is being demanded to track down possible visitors from outer space and this is serious. A small group demonstrators have staged a protest outside the U N Headquarters in New York calling for an end to what they say is a cover up over the existence of U F Os. One of the organizers, Michael Luckman, says President Clinton is scared to acknowledge that superior beings do exist. The United States er government is afraid as are other governments to admit er to their people that there is a higher form of life. Obviously if the U F Os touch down that would mean they would be charge and not Bill Clinton at the White House. Okay well er I I figure that there must be quite a number of er extraterrestrials around around North Yorkshire and I thought it would be quite nice actually if er if there are any extraterrestrials listening at the moment they could ring in and we could have a chat. So if erm if if you yeah yes E T E T phoned when what do you want? I'm not even speaking to you because of that flipping letter. I mean I just noticed it I read, sorry Karen walked into the studio totally uninvited through a red light. That's a particular no no I mean you know for goodness sake can't we av can't we actually ob observe studio discipline? What you doing? Just shutting that up a bit. That's my knob if I want it open I'll leave it open. Don't flatter yourself. There we are you see. Just smutty mind haven't you really.

Get Bert on the phone I want a word with him now. Come on you lot you know where he is get him on the phone I want to talk to him. The individual responsible for this unacceptable behaviour shall remain nameless protect his listening and viewing ratings suffice it to say that his name suggests that he is capable of making a big splash. Is this the sort of person that's running the B B C? I don't believe he wrote this. Erm Likes to spout a lot and is never happier than when he is chewing up all the small fry in the world . This is . The D G joins me in wishing you every success in your future career. You're destined for big things obviously. I wondered whether you were erm I wonder whether you were for the bullet or not? No it's you. Oh it's me I see. Is traffic ready? Yes. Are you sure? Honest. Oh good. We're not going to make a cockup like we did last week are we?

That's between Bedale and Catterick at the moment and slight delays are possible there. Also on the A one in the Leeming area the inside lane of the south bound carriageway's closed at Holby Grange for emergency gas repair works and delays are likely as a result there. In Selby there's a demonstration taking place this afternoon it starts at half past one and will go via Barlby Road and Scott Road and some traffic delay delays are likely as a result. Also in York today traffic near to the Knavesmire could be slow due to an event taking place there. In the Ripon area weekend roadworks mean the Road will be closed as it passes under the A one bridge delays are likely as a result. At Stockton on Forest Stockton main bridge over the A sixty four is closed for resurfacing work through to six o'clock on Monday morning. And finally in the Thirsk area there are no further reports of snow on the high ground there but some moorland routes may still be a little slippery. Danny Savage A A Roadwatch. Oh very nice Danny very nice. This is were I pull this up and go . I'm not supposed to talk over the singing bit am I? No. Yeah. I'm sor Danny I am sorry. Okay next time, an hour's time . All right? Bye Yeah it'll be good. Okay. Bye bye. Bye bye. Danny Savage with the er the traffic. Now the the trains the twelve twenty eight Aberdeen isn't going to leave until twelve fifty four er let's have a look anything else er Liverpool twelve thirty eight Middlesborough Edge Hill er no leaves on the line but you know you don't you never know the er er er I don't understand that the thirteen eighteen what's that? What does Sar Scarborough I suppose that is? Gla go ge gar ge ga has the computer gone mad? Yeah I'm sorry but the computer's gone mad. Stay at home in front of the fire and listen to Radio York. Ha ha. Oh that was slick. Okay now er Garth Brookes my favourite country singer at the moment and er your chance to win this Elvis video okay you have to ring in we're giving this away first you have to ring in and tell me and tell me the next word no I can't do that I can't no I can't do it's too easy okay. All right tell me er complete the sentence of this of this particular hit song that Elvis er had and it's difficult all right. There were three words in the don't ring yet there were three words in the title I'll give you two you have got to give me the last one. It is difficult it is difficult I know all right? O nine O four six four one six four one this is it. Ready? The Hawaiian wedding Okay no y you can't have got . There are three wo don't answer them yet. Don't let the them ring for a bit. The Hawaiian wedding now there's a word there missing I wonder if I wonder if you can erm if you can guess that if you are the most entertaining winner you will get this Elvis video. Aha. Garth Brookes We Shall Be Free I love it I love it I love it. O K O nine six four one six four one very few calls out there at the moment I mean er. Noel is there hello Noel how are you? Hello I'm fine thank you. What are you on here for? Because er because I was invited on to speak about current educational issues Oh that's good I couldn't you see it's very difficult for me you know I have to look up there I can never distinguish one one one call from another. Right. Do you have a tit do you want me to your a title do you have er? I'm Press Officer for North Yorkshire National Union of Teachers. Yeah. Yo you're very lucky actually Noel that this is not erm a quiz show. Shall I tell you for why? Why? I'll tell you why cos the B B C there's a directive just gone out I've just been informed the B B C for quiz show hosts on the B B C to treat their guests with a little more civility. Can you believe it? How much more flipping civil can you get. Have you heard these quiz sho I mean they're all on radio four aren't they? All the quiz show yeah basically ? Well rad radio one as well. Mm Where do you live anyway? In Leeds. Oh good. Mm it's freezing outside isn't. It certainly is yes. What are we talk oh education we're talking about education right yep. Okay let me do the prog right er Noel that's a funny name Noel by the way isn't it? It's erm appropriate for the time of the year nearly . Mm It's like pulse but not. Oh oh er yes. Is that how you pronounce it? Erm it it is pronounce to Not the Noel y yeah okay. Anyway right so erm head teachers in the area have been complaining their schools are not tidy not cleaned sufficiently. Yes. Why? I mean why why are our children going to school in in pig sties? Well I think it's er down to the competitive tendering process where the County Council has had to put out the cleaning contracts for schools to tender. There were problems a few years ago when it first started with th the initial contract which was was won by the the County's own direct service organization and now it seems we're having a repeat of of those problems. Er with the new contracts that started in September erm basically it seems that some teachers are having to do bits of cleaning themselves to keep their their classroom up to up to scratch up to the standards they ought they ought to be. Erm we're hearing reports that parts of schools having to to be closed or th threatened to be closed because they're not sufficiently hygienic for pupils or teachers to work in. Oh how disgusting. And er That is isn't that disgusting? It certainly is yes . That is disgusting yes. So all these a lot of where, so we can organize the coach now, and if you're interested in Scarborough go and stand in that circle,Whit Whitby there, interested in both then stand where the two circles intersect. Yeah. Okay. Now take it from there. What will you what how can you work out Well erm just count how many's erm I mean two teachers come back and one of them says, Well I've counted all those who are going to Whitby. and the other one says, I've counted all those who are going to Scarborough, Mhm. and er nobody remembered to count the ones in the middle. But we do know there were thirty pupils, which hasn't Has that appeared in your equation anywhere? No not really. No. Now erm I still don't really understand where you got this from. Erm Why did you you do twenty one minus thirteen for a start? Well I had the the twenty one and thirteen in the two groups so subtract those two and have twice the amount of X I thought I would have . Erm you you seem to be equating the groups. Okay. We won't go into where you go that from cos I think it sounds a bit like sort of clutching at straws really. Yeah. I'm going to get an equation out of this. You you've you've started off brilliantly. You've got marked on you know exactly how many are going to Whitby,right, twenty one minus X, how many are going to both, and how many are going to Scarborough. So what could you find out from that? That ties up with this. That ties up with . You could er subtract the number going to Whitby from thirty. You could. Erm You could do something a lot And then simpler. A lot simpler. How many pupils were there altogether? There were thirty pupils so And how many are there standing there in the playground? There's thirty. Right? Right. So an equation? Yeah. Count how many you've got in here. We've got twenty one minus So twenty one minus X plus thirteen minus X is equal to thirty. And those in the middle as well. But oh twenty one minus X plus X plus thirteen minus X is thirty . Right. So we just right that down, that's the total. So we've got twenty one minus X those are the ones going to Whitby, and we've got X going to both, and we've got thirteen minus X, and that's the lot. Now assume that this is assuming they all voted. They all said, Yes we do want to go. Yeah. Erm it would have been better if they'd given you some information to say, They all voted for at least one Yeah. trip, or there were four who went nowhere. Okay. So. Erm What does that give you? So it'd be erm thirty four minus two X plus X erm Okay. Er X So how do you just I mean rather than do it in your head, especially in an exam, just what you're going to do, put the Add X to both sides say. Erm If you add X to minus X . Oh it's three yeah. Right. Let's have a little look. Thirty four equals thirty. Right. If we just take it from there. Thirty four minus X equals thirty. Now as soon as you've got a minus X and you're trying to take it over to one side, and you're trying to bring the other one over, there's a good chance that something's going to go wrong. So why not just follow a nice simple system. Thirty four minus X equals thirty. Okay. Add X to each side. They go out. Subtract thirty from both sides. Thirty four minus thirty equals thirty minus thirty add X. Okay. So X is equal to? Four. Which is what you've got there. And Yeah. Now does it add up? It should do this time if your if Is this right? We've got Let's check that. got the same answer still. Twenty one minus X If I give you some numbers to add up. If I said twenty seven add thirty five add forty nine add seventeen, would you add them up like that? Or might you put them one under another? Yeah I'd probably put the numbers Okay. So which are easier to Yes. fit ea slip easier. Twenty one minus X plus X plus thirteen minus X. Tot those up. Plus X and a minus X go out. That gives minus X. Thirty four equals thirty. Erm there may be a simpler way of doing it. Now is this right? Cos we're still getting X equals four. Add the X to each side,take the thirty off each side we've got X equals four. So what's going wrong here? Seventeen and Ah. Oh sorry nine yeah. Nine yeah. Because that comes to because that comes to nine.. Yeah that's right. And that comes to . that comes to thirty. Okay. So it does come to thirty. Erm the way you were doing it will sometimes give the right answer but the easiest way Yeah. is to make sure every box is marked in there. Let's do a slightly more complicated version. Erm scribble on here. Now let's sort this out. Erm let's see Okay. Let's see if those erm Right. This time Let's take that off. This time there are twenty nine in the class. So you've got twenty nine students in the class and fifteen want to go to Whitby,and eight want to go to Scarborough,and three little piggies want to stay at home. Three of them don't want to go anywhere. Twenty nine in the class so what I'd like to know is erm draw the Venn diagram and find out the numbers of students in every section of the diagram. And then if you can do that you can do any problem of this sort can't you? Yeah I suppose so. three. Right. Okay. So where are you going to start? Yeah but this Right. That doesn't add up to twenty nine, does it? It doesn't add up to twenty nine . Eleven. Erm Twenty six. Twenty six. Okay. Well spotted. I probably mean nineteen or something. Let's have a look. Erm Erm Okay. Seven seven don't want to go anywhere. Right. Seven don't want to go anywhere. Right. Okay. That's great. Erm that's So you've got the various sections of the diagram. You've got the Whitby lot, the Whitby and Scarborough, Scarborough and the don't want to go anywhere. When when you when you add them up just if you just put them under each other, it makes it very easy. So keep the numbers That goes there. that's it keep the numbers under the numbers and the Xs under the Xs. Okay it's twenty nine right. So an X plus er So X equals one. Okay. What will that give us? That's Fourteen and seven is twenty one. Fourteen that was sent to me by the the people who want the stuff. So Oh right yeah. . Okay what does that come to? Er twenty twenty nine Twenty nine. Now you might think, Erm oh a bit finickity saying do it this way, but it's a good system. Erm also when you're when you're adding up if you get this fifteen minus X, right, eight minus X and you're putting You just cross those. the numbers underneath each other and the Xs underneath each other, plus X, and then the plus sign X. well that goes with the numbers. Yeah? Then when you add them up You don't get confused. So I can just Mm. take these two off. Because there are Mm. so many, it's very very easy to do. Yeah. Lots of people'll finish up with, Oh that's a three X and they'll put plus three. Mhm. And this way it's more obvious what's going on. There's going to be a minus X left over there, and then you can add those up. Thirty minus X equals, how many were there, twenty nine. And it more or less does itself. Yeah. So as I said, if I give you a list of numbers, say two- or three- digit numbers Yeah. in a long line,horizontally, you'd think, Oh I'd like to put these vertically Yeah. and do a nice little adding up on it. So why not do it with Xs, because there's more chance of an error. Now why it's a good idea to do it that way So I don't in me head like and mixed up. Again in an exam, there's more chance that you make a little slip, because there's little bit of extra edge. nerves like. A similar one. Erm this time everyone's at Wembley and you're asking people,Right, if you draw this time we draw three big circles in the middle of Wembley,okay,and ask people to come and say which football team they think is a good one. So we've got Liverpool, Everton and Tranmere Rovers. So they say The instructions to the crowd are, If you think Liverpool is a a good football team, stand anywhere in that circle, Everton in that circle, Tranmere Rovers, stand in this one. And we get something like this. Erm and let's say there are a few a few awkward ones here er who don't think any of them Yeah. are a good team. So those who think Liverpool is a good one,standing in in that circle, we've got say twelve thousand. Okay. In the Everton circle we've got say fourteen thousand. And in the Tranmere circle we've got erm twenty thousand say. Okay. And we've got thirty thirty thousand people there altogether. Now so I want to know the sort of the numbers in all the boxes. Now Right. talk about it a bit before you start it. Erm is it similar to the problem you've done? Is it harder? Is it much harder? Well it's just erm it's like doing three of the previous ones isn't it like? Yeah. How are you going to sort that out? Erm well I'll start off labelling these W X Y Z. Right. And er label this. That's . So as you're labelling it, what do you think of the problem? Erm it's er Do you think it's easy or very much harder than the last one or just er pretty difficult eh. No. You're not going to be able to just look at it and write down something equals two X are you . No. You've got to really work out what's what. Right. Okay. So you've labelled your diagram and you this one is that minus W minus Y minus X so on. Erm it's a bit a bit awkward-looking isn't it? Yeah just a bit. Could you have labelled it in a way that would sort of help yourself more? Make it a bit simpler. those three added together, so W plus X plus Y plus plus the er the rest of E equal fourteen thousand. Yeah. Okay. So what's your next step from there? Oh right, I write it down on the paper. So erm Okay. And how many equations are you going to get do you think? Erm . About. About. Okay. All right. Hundreds. About hundreds. Erm No erm Well okay let's look at it another way. How many equations would you l would you like? Mm about one. Just one or two. Erm If I gave you a problem about sort of prices of apples and pears I suppose it no I suppose erm two W plus two three Y plus X plus Z Mm. If I said erm, Ten pears plus six apples costs two pound forty, Yeah. how much does one apple cost? what would you say to that? You can't really do it really. Why not? Cos you've got two unknowns. And? And only one equation. Right. So that give you any ideas about this . You got to have two two equations. Two equations. How many unknowns have we got? Erm. Three four five. No. That the I've got I I know these. You know those. I've got four unknowns there. So you've got four unknowns, so you're going to need Four equations right? Does that sound a bit daunting? Yeah. Well so four simultaneous equations. Mhm. And they won but they won't be difficult cos they're all linear. Yeah. They're all there're no X squareds or W squareds or anything else in. . But you can do them. So with with that, you know how much the total comes to, thirty thousand. Right. So I could put Oh aye yeah, W plus e Y plus X plus E equals fourteen thousand. Mm. And erm . Have you used Say in the first one, Yeah. Er you didn't use that. So can you use can you think of an equation that involves that? The total people. Well tell me tell from your diagram, what's the total? Thirty thousand that are there. Right, but that okay ? Oh just these added up? Okay. So don't forget the one thousand who don't think any of them are a good team, add all those up and that will give you a fourth equation. Yeah. And all you need to do then is to find one of these in terms of the others and substitute in, and it'll come out fairly easily. Now you can choose these erm slightly differently. For example you've got lots of got lots of minuses in. What you could have done say was this one here that's marked E doesn't have to be all of those who supported Everton, it could be just that bit. Yeah. Right. And you can an expression for it then in terms of that. But there's no reason why you stop at three. It could have been twenty five different variables Yeah. there are in real problems. Erm With two it's not too difficult. I mean sometimes you can almost just try an intelligent guess and maybe Yeah. about the third guess you try you get the right answer. With that, there's not much chance . No. Okay. Erm so you need to develop a system that's going to always give you a method and is always making the work easier for you and not getting you lost. Okay. So that's enough I think Mm. on that to sort of show you the power of the system we were just using to erm The obvious thing to do is to label every area of the diagram, and don't forget they do sometimes say, Seven were not interested in Yeah. in anything. Label every area and then use what they give you about the total number. The total was thirty pupils,add all that lot up equals thirty. And when you were doing these with lots of you've got now got W X Y and Z in,when you're adding up if you lay them out like that Right yeah. with the Ws under the Ws it's you'll find that those horrible looking equations will simplify quite nicely cos there'll be a plus W and a minus W. I see yeah. And you'll get things that you know you'll get an equation just in X then . So it'll be erm so fourteen thousand minus W minus Y minus X Mhm. and the next one then twelve thousand minus W Mm. minus Y, then Yeah. miss that gap plus Z That's it. Exactly. And then that one Right, you've got it. two thousand plus Yeah. Y and X and Z. So although it looks like, Ooh this is horrible, four equations four unknowns, I'll be here all night And then it's not cos you're just . I've got You're eliminating one at a time. Yeah. Once you've got that fourth equation in from all this lot adds up to the total, and that's the one that you seem to be forgetting, that's the one you've got to try and remember. Okay? So shouldn't be any problem on those. This one er I wasn't too sure either. Mm looks like geometry to me. Mm yeah yeah. So A B is parallel to D C. Calculate the values of erm write down possible Okay. Erm it's geometry. That's the answer to that, Yeah. basically. It's something that I usually say, Leave till the last. It is a Did you spend much time on that? No I j just had a l er Good. er an attempt and then I thought, No I'm not Good. gonna It's a waste of time . It's it's it's the sort of thing that I would always recommend And there's only about three marks for it anyway so. Exactly. Leave your attempt till the end. So rather than you going well on this nice question, and you could you could have done it and picked up Yeah. another sort of six marks or maybe eight marks for the the end bit of the question, erm you'd spent a bit of time on this. Anything to do with geometry unless you've had a lot of practice and you're very good at it, you can finish up wasting time. Yeah. So I would say, Have a go but leave it till last, when you when you've done everything else and maybe you when you've just checked through to see if the others are okay. So let's have a a little look here. Political party making election promises. Erm was that one alright? Yeah. That wasn't too bad. Eight percent every year. a hundred and seventy five billion. Mhm. Erm put it over a hundred times the eight. Okay. And then you add that onto that. And the next Right. year you get Now. Okay. Erm Mm, yeah that's good. And did you do it that way, you worked out the percentage and added it on? Yeah. Added it on after Right. What's Start off with a hundred pound Yeah. and add twenty percent on. Yeah. What's the final amount ? Hundred and twenty. Okay. Start off with a hundred pounds and add thirty five percent on. So a hundred and thirty five pounds yeah. Okay. Start off with erm two hundred and add thirty five percent on. What's your final answer ? Erm two Two hundred Okay. and seventy. So how are you working it out? It's erm two hundred over a hundred Two hundred and then work out thirty five over a hundred of that, Er work out what that comes to, which is seventy, and then add your two hundred on. Okay. Well if we do something like what we finish up with is thirty five percent of two hundred of two hundred okay, plus a hundred percent isn't it? Yeah. Of two hundred. So what does that come to? A hundred and thirty five percent. Oh I see yeah. Okay. . So if you want to So it's if you when especially as you're going to do it on your calculator anyway, . what would you multiply to get the answer straight off? What would you multiply that two hundred by? One three five and then percentage. One point Three oh three five . three five. Yeah, or a hundred and thirty five percent as you said. Yeah. Erm if you find you've got a calculator without a percentage key, and some of them haven't, especially Yeah. some of the scientific ones, mine's got one. erm you can just do that . . So if I wanted to find out erm Let's do that one with the the N H S, and this time I want to know how much it's going to be It starts off at a hundred pounds. Yeah. A hundred billion. Okay, just call it a hundred. And we increase it by ten perc Well let's say we increase it by It's not out money is it, so let's really spend it and increase it by fifty percent every year. Yeah. What would you multiply that by, that hundred? One point five. Okay. So do that try that on your calculator. So what did you get? hundred and fifty pound. Right. So while that's still in, times one point five again. . Well you've still got your one fifty in, so times one point five. So two hundred and twenty five right. And leaving that in, times one point five. That's three hundred and thirty seven point five. So you can see how they as if they ask you to do it over three years or five years or something You just keep on doing that yeah. you don't you're not doing several operations and putting some in memory and bringing it back and giving yourself lots of chances of making mistakes. No. It's just multiply it by that constant thing each time. And with most with a lot of calculators I mean you Don't try it unless you really know your calculator and know how it works, you can just keep pressing equals, Yeah. and it does the last thing you've done times the Yeah. say do it once and say we want six years, put equals equals equals Yeah. more times. Erm if you're going to use =thing something like that in the exam I mean there's no reason why you shouldn't use that multiplying it by one point whatever the percentage is. Yeah. What would you have multiplied it by if it was erm the eight percent? One point eight. One point Well what would you Oh ze oh zero eight, yeah sorry zero eight . Yeah, okay. That's the only thing to watch, that. Yeah cos that'd be Eigh eighty percent that'd be eighty percent yeah. eighty percent is one point eight but eight percent, okay seven percent one point O seven. That's the only snag with that, that you you can get the wrong But it's very much way of doing it . Yeah. Okay. Solve the equation. That's pretty straightforward that. Expand that. You can do that. Yeah. so much for its call-out fixed charge plus the time. That's okay. Yeah. Yeah? And then working backwards. It costs Yeah. sixty five pound And then just er just changing the subject there like. Right. Now if we put that on there. Erm I dunno this is somebody else's paper so This is before I had a I worked it out as I I th I thought it'd work out a three- four-five triangle. Mm. Did you work out it was a ninety degrees? Erm yeah well I I Why? I realized that cos Why? Cos it looked it? No cos erm the here you've got this in a semicircle, Right. and if it's touching Okay. the top it's always ninety degrees . Did you say that on the paper? Erm I just put a little arrow with ninety degrees in the semicircle . Mm. Cos it looked it. Erm wh what they're looking for in this answer is erm Because it's the angle in the semicircle angle B is ninety degrees. Yeah. And then carry on and do the other bit. Erm you know you can look at that or you can put a protractor on it and Mm. think Well that's ninety, but you need to say that it is ninety because it's the angle in there. Yeah. Okay. Right. So you'd probably get minimum marks for that . three marks for that anyway. Mhm. What did you think of this? I looked at it and I er panicked. Then I looked at it again and I realized that it wasn't too hard. Mm. I mean I got er the only th part erm I did mess up a bit was the the part here. Mm. Cos I got this the wrong way round. But other than that I got the right. Right. Now this this what I'd like you to do,is read it out but only read the absolute bare bones of it. We don't want to hear anything about Janet having trouble with her bike and Janet a powerful young woman or riding the race of her life , or any don't want Yeah. any of that. It's just rubbish. When you when you're reading this through, you're having a quick skim through, you can can you can cross out, you can sort of totally obliterate Yeah. what you don't want to know because it's One of the problems here is there's so much noise. Yeah. There's so much random stuff that you don't just details irrelevant . yeah. You don't want to know that she was wearing odd socks and one of them was green, it's Mhm. nothing to do with drawing the graph of distance against time. So what are the important points in that ? That they set off neck and neck. Okay set off neck and neck. Right. Alright. Then Janet took the lead then overtaken ten seconds later. Mhm. Then built up a lead of fifty metres. Right. And so she behind all the way but caught up with her a few metres Before the end. before the end. Oh just before the finish, fifty metres from the finishing line. And then Janet overtook her just before the finishing line. Right. So all this about the North Rose Trophy and it's just When you see You f you said you felt like panicking. Yeah. You're in middle of an exam, you're trying to do everything very quickly, and there's a great long screed of text Mm. to plough your way through. Erm so get sort of practise reading it so you can cut out the irrelevant stuff. And a good thing as I say is to just erm highlight the stuff that you want if you've Yeah. got a highlighter, or maybe underline it, and maybe even cross out. Yeah. Because you rea you're going to read this about three or four times aren't you? Yeah. before you understand what on earth is going on here. They started off neck and neck. They started off together. Okay. This one goes in the lead and then stops and then the other one goes in the lead and then she puts a spurt on and catches up. You'll read that sort of round and round a few times before you get it straight in your head what's Yeah. going on, and you don't need all this garbage in it as well. So your first time through you can cut some of that stuff out, and then you've got it. You've got the bones of the problem. Then you can work with it. Erm so do you think you got it sorted out roughly? Even I mean you didn't quite get it sorted out in the exam but No. did you think that you know what you've done wrong now, Yeah. and how to do it? Yeah. There's there is often something on distance time graphs and also quite often it's like that. Now I think that's not a maths question. No. No. That's an English question. Yeah. I mean if you I don't know if you know of anyone whose standard of English is quite poor No. but their maths are okay. Mm. Now that's quite an unfair question. Cos if they can't read through a lot of text and sort it out they haven't got much chance . No. They just sit there mesmerized for half an hour and then Right time's up. Okay. So you're alright on trine time train Yeah. train timetables. Mm? You just draw a line of best fit you know line of best fit through erm all the points well Okay. the one that goes nearest the majority of points. One goes nearest the majority of points. Okay. So if you've got a load of points all here Mm. and there's one stray off here, you'd go through that way, the line of best fit. Ignore any strays. Mm. Okay. How about the gradient of the line? That's like the average what is it it's a Distance so it's the average speed that's been travelled throughout the journeys. Mm. Erm the gradient of a line okay, there's a there's a bit of graph paper. Okay X is and there's a line. What's its gradient? Erm the change in the Y Okay it so change in the It it's so measure measure the gradient of that and tell me what it is. I'll make it so they're nice and e even. Now you said you'd make it even. Yeah. What did you mean by that? Oh t I had two point nine by three Mm. by seven point nine. Okay. The one you made nice and easy was the nice and even was the Y. Yeah. Which one are you going to divide by? The Y, so change in Y over change in X so Mm. You're going to divide by the X . Oh yeah, best off doing the Yeah. It doesn't matter cos you can . . Better get rid of that line yeah. Probably pencil . Okay. And what does that come to roughly ? It's about erm two point eight. Right. Two point eight Seven centimetre. So that's erm . . What's what's the units? I don't know it's just whatever the Well what have you done? What did you do? Oh I cha I divided Y over You divided Divided the change in Y So many millimetres Yeah. by another number of millimetres Oh right, oh millimetres that's it yeah . and what's the answer? Erm millimetres . Millimetres divided by millimetres is what ? Yeah it's millimetres square. Millimetres erm the other one. What is it? Erm What's X divided by X? One. Er one X. Just X. Just one. It's just millimetres . No it's just one. It's not millimetres, it's nothing. It's just a number. So that's just millimetres then yeah . It's millimetres divided by milli No, it's not millimetres. No this . The answer is not in millimetres. The answer is just a number. Oh right. It's a ratio of one length to another. Okay? Yeah. Find the ratio of that height to that length. Mm. Okay. And let's say it's a third. Mm. It's not a third of metre, a third of a millimetre or a third of a kilometre, it's just a third, the ratio of that length to that one. Okay? I see. So the ratio of that length to that one is point four. But the gradient the gradient of the hill erm you could express it in terms of an angle couldn't you? Yeah. If I say, Is that hill very steep? Ooh yes, about forty degrees. So if we look at this Twenty five. Twenty five. Find the tan of twenty five degrees. It won't be in centimetres or millimetres, it'll just be a number . Two point four six. Right. Six three . That's a much more accurate way of finding the gradient. . Just find the tan of the angle. You don't have to measure. You've got two measurements here. This two point eight isn't accurate. No. It's what, plus or minus point one almost. Yeah. I mean point one of a millimetre's not much. You could be almost well you could at least plus or minus point O five. Yeah. Right. Which is a big percentage that you're And both of these could be out. One could Yeah. be too big and one could be too small, which would make a big difference. But you can measure the angle pretty accurately on that to s to within say half a degree and have its tan. Right yeah . Erm because there's your angle,there's that, and this is opposite over adjacent. So the gradient it's a ratio it's not no units to it, not metres millimetres or anything else, and it's the tan of the angle. So the gradient gives you a mea If I gave you the gradient, if I said the gradient is one, what would the angle be? Erm How would you find the angle? Just one and then do the tan backwards. Okay tan to the minus one . five. So there's a that's that's what gradient means, the tie-up between them. It's not In some cases like erm the diagram you were doing about the two girls running,erm then the distance against time gradient will give you speed, give you velocity. We've done the Roses,you're okay on the symmetry, you know about that now. Yeah. I mean if if it hadn't got a ,there's noise in the problem there's Yeah. irrelevant stuff. If you if you you strip it down to the Actually I didn't know how to do the arc . I wasn't sure how to do that. Okay. But you know now. Erm That was pretty st that the height of just a bit of It's a bit of algy and a bit of pythagoras Yeah. in together. And the area. What is how about that one? What is the square root of six point four by ten to the ten to the five? Well erm eight hundred but when I did it wrote it into normal terms like six point sixty four with one two three four noughts Mm. and then I square rooted it. Mm. Erm yeah, I square rooted it. Okay. Yeah that's a good way to do it. Mm slightly more easier for you is just multiply it by one of those tens so you've got sixty four by ten to the four. The square root of sixty then take the square root of Eight. The square root of the sixty four is eight, the square root of the ten to the four ten squared. Oh right yeah. Yeah. Erm okay. It's a good way to do it to if you think, Oh I can't really handle this going on here, put all your noughts on and then you can work out what they come to. Okay. Erm weather stations near the north pole. we should start ringing alarms bells a little bit. So what did you do for this one? Right I measured well it's seven kilometres apart so I measured the distance between them. Ah. Mm? Erm in centimetres or millimetres . And it came to five. It wasn't seven centimetres eh ? No so it's And it should have been shouldn't it? fifty millimetres. Right. Okay, so you worked out what the scale was. Yeah. And then what did you do? Erm I so it was for one So seven kilometres is equal to fifty millimetres. Mhm. I did erm Yeah. So you seven work out your scale that comes to So seven over five. And then what did you do for this next bit? It knows it's between four and three kilom kilometres away. Yeah. So er point seven one er is equal to one kilometre. Mhm. So work out the Yeah. So four kilometres so multiply point seven one by four. Yeah. You worked out what that would be and then on the one the scale and then what did you do ? Yeah I worked out what this would be on the scale. that's from T so I dr drew a line a cir a circumference . A circle. Right. So I did round there. Yeah. and a smaller one round there. Right. So you work out . what the scale is so you can set your radius and draw your two circles and say, It's in there somewhere. Yeah. Okay. That should get full marks. Yeah. Bit . Mm. Erm er that trig trigonometry there again. Mhm. And then er just work out the length of this and then the length of that and then subtract these two lengths. So that's quite a nice question. Erm Seven marks on that. Okay. Transformation. You alright on the transformation? Yeah. Yeah. You've been doing those alright haven't you . . Ah. Mm. How many of those can you get out of one of those eh? Erm How many mugs of water to fill the tank? . Okay. So you cal calculate the volume. Yeah. That one's no problem. Yeah. You think, Right I've done that with me fish tank. That one. What did you do for that? Erm I used the equation sheet which he wri wrote on the board. Right. Okay which would have been on the front of your paper . Yeah but he we didn't have any Right so as soon as you see that you think, Ah volume of a cylinder, I know, whee! straight to the front. Look at it and then erm measured it I did I d and then I redid this one and put it in the same scale, Yeah. and then erm the answer I got for this Mm. So divided it by that. you what did you you used centimetres here did you? Yeah. Right. Good. Because that thing you did with the fish tank has shown Yeah. you that you can't say, Well one centimetre is a hundredth of a metre so No. one cubic centimetre's going to be a hundredth of a cubic metre. it's obvious. It's not it might be obvious but it's not true. Okay that that's the big thing they're looking for there. Convert it to the same units, use the formula and then I mean that's a gift that isn't it? Yeah. Mm? Six marks there for nothing really. Imagine them all bringing their mugs to fill the tank . Mm. Now you've got to rework it again in cubic metres Yeah. and work out how many seconds. There's nine marks on that Yeah. really a gift wasn't it? Yeah I mean it's a it would be a joy to do it as well cos you think, I know how to do these. Yeah isn't this easy, this is relaxing. Okay. Erm I think you know there how to pick up quite a few Quite a few more marks yeah. quite a few marks without you learning anything No. that you don't know already. Yeah? Yeah It's just sort of looking at 'em a bit. Erm the geometry one that we didn't look at,you might be able to spot it in minutes, Yeah. you know seconds even. You might be still on it twenty minutes later. Yeah. So keep it for the end and keep it for when you've not only done all the questions but had a quick check through to see have Yeah. you done something daft. Yeah. Cos that's where the marks are thrown away. Not Yeah. not something you can't do but something you've done ten times before. You just make a one silly mistake like. And you just think you know you like you've put metres instead of centimetres on the the hosepipe or something like that and you think, Oh that's not right, that you will spot . Like when you write a letter and you read it through and you think, Ooh I've missed a word out here, Mm. or I've you know run two words in together or something. So that few minutes at the end is important for picking up these extra marks you've been trying to throw away,okay, where you can do it, and the few minutes at the beginning is to look through and find that question wherever it was, that one on the last page. Lot of marks going for it, dead ea And again it's a s it's a joy to do this sort isn't it. Yeah. Cos you can see where you're going all the way through, Yeah. you know that you know it it's nice It's just like nice and easy. and you feel really confident about it, you think, Wow this is piling up the marks . So look for the good ones don't spend too much t There'll only be one little geometry thing Yeah. fiddling about with triangles and circles and stuff like that. So have a go And it's only about two or three five marks. Exactly. So have a go at it when you've done the others. Okay. Well I'd better get off. another one to get to soon. That's mine. That's yours. Right. Practise with that protractor, Yeah. so that you get used to it so that you prefer to use it to the other one. Have have have both , but if you've got bearings It easy to b better . use that . If someone gives you a polygon to draw Yeah. Use that cos it's not not fiddling Yeah. around twisting it. I mean in the time is takes you to do a sketch you can draw accurately Be easier to . draw round it,dot dot dot,draw even if you then sketch it without using a straight line, if you just join up the dots freehand , Yeah. you get a very good sketch and you can see what's going on and you can see the angles. . That's your one. Erm Next week. What's happening about that? Where are we ? I'm on holiday then so er You're on holiday. Right. Yeah. Okay. So is that for What about the week after that? Erm no I think I've got about two weeks off. Okay, so I'll see you erm So we break up on Wednesday that's Friday Friday, So three Fridays. Three Fridays. Yeah.. So I'll see you in about I'd better work out what the date is. Erm Can have a look on the calendar in there. Okay. And probably be an idea if you remind me sometime during that week when I'm due to see you. Alright yeah I'll give you yeah . Just give me a just give me a ring. But er we'll we'll skip the next three then. Alright yeah. Okay. I better remember my tape recorder. Okay. Erm I've found out when the exam is. Yeah? It's erm right at the end of the month of the rest of the exams. Okay. So erm Yeah it's well well at the end of the month. So have you got what's what's the best Morning Mrs . Good morning Doctor. Well now, what can I do for you today? I've been coming for sh three weeks now. And I came to ask the doctor if I could get H R T. And she took my blood pressure and it was too high She chased you. so she didn't give me anything the first time, but she Mhm. The second time. The second time, it was a different doctor again, and she gave me tablets and I can't remember the name. It was I just took the last one on Saturday, and I then threw the Aye. The wee white ones, Aye. Right. Brusc something Aye. So Right. Show us your muscles. Let's see what you're doing to your poor old self. I don't know why I think maybe the, the tablets helped, but erm I was saying I was kind of having second thoughts whether I was wanting to go on the H R T or No. No. No chance. No chance. Not, not with your blood pressure up like that. No er well she didn't say much, but she Well, no chance I can tell you now. Whenever er Just get yourself down. And I thought er and er I had wee tablets that you gave me a while ago,Brusdeximit Mhm. And I was wondering maybe if I'd be better going back on them. Aye, you'd be safer a lot safer on them. And they won't er they won't fight with your blood pressure. Here just let your arm . On second thought, it'd be . Aye. It's, it's amazing how many folk come up to see about it, and they, they decide eventually not to. Doing fine. You're fine but you'll need to stay on your wee tablets I'm afraid. And er I think you can forget the H R T. I will, I felt maybe er when I came up to see, oh I was having all these heavy sweatings. Just was it was really Mhm. Mhm. pain up sore back, so. And Falling to bits. to bits . then I had another I had another wee problem that I'd been, I had been to see, and it was Doctor I had been, and the doctor that I saw the last time er I had three big bruises on my back, and she Mhm. says I don't know what this is. But this was a wee sort of lump that I had down at the bottom of my vagina. Right. I don't know whether you would call it a lump or not, I said to her it was like a wee spot. Mhm. So she, she says well I don't know what that is, she says. So I'll send you to the hospital. So I've to go on Yeah. Friday to see Right. Doctor . Right. Now have you got plenty of the wee tablets or are you finished? No, I finished 'em. Finished all that lot. Right, Agnes. Finished them on Saturday. Mm That's how I was, I was saying had been at the hospital, come back and says no, my No. tablets are finished, I'd better go to the doc No, you'd better. You need to get that, need to keep that down because if you do go to the hospital, and they did decide to take that out, they would ne d they would check your blood pressure and they would chase you. There's no way they would touch it at all. So It's no, I don't really know cos the doctor says she didn't know what it was either. Doctor seen it first, she thought I had pulled a hair and it was kind of septic Septic Aye. and she gave me tablets, Aye, that leaves antibiotics. leaves a wee cyst underneath the skin. Is that what it would Mhm. be then? Yeah, that's probably what it is. It it's no really er giving me any No. Just, no. much trouble or anything , but it was just the fact of it being there. It's there. It's there. And it's always a worry when you don't know what's going on. And the trouble is it can turn septic again, and put the whole thing sky high again. But s what about your Dixevit Are you needing any more of them? I haven't got them. I've no I haven't Nothing? been taking them Oh well. for ages and ages. Keep some in the house in case you do get a bad spell. Because they're s they're safe. Would it no be similar to kept taking Dixevit instead of the other ones Doctor ? No. No? No, they wouldn't affect your Wouldn't do anything wouldn't affect your pressure. No. They wouldn't affect your pressure. They're very they're good and they have very few side effects, this is the beauty Aha. of the Dixevit they keep the flushings down, Aye. and they don't affect your blood pressure. Aye. So, stick with them, if, if you're having a bad time, use them. If you don't leave them be. Leave them be. But keep on your wee white ones every morning, Agnes. One at breakfast time, Aye, er I er oh well I took them, took them regular, because Aha. you gave me only thirty, Yes. and that was enough. That's right. So Well, we'll see you in a couple of months again. Er will I have enough to keep me going,? Er yeah. You'll have enough to keep you going for a couple of months. Could I get some ? There we are now. See how the boy takes Zantac Doctor , is there two strength of Zantac Mhm. And he's Yeah. getting the lesser one do you think? Would it be advisable for him to get the higher one? Er He's with the, with the bigger strength you only take one, they only allow you one a day. Mhm. He doesn't really, I think at the moment he takes one and er he doesn't sort of take them like Mhm. constantly or er when he gets the heartburn Er that's sort of thing that's he takes Aye this is this is the very strong one. Just . Aye, just one of these a day. When he needs them. I was going to put the thing in there, but I thought I would ask first before you know. He's still living with you at ? Aha. Hasn't run away and got married or anything? No, not till the sixteenth of July. And he's not running away he's getting . Same thing. Same thing. peace and quiet, What about your own family? You still got them? Yeah. Oh well. Yeah, they're still Still keeping you still keeping me out of mischief. Still keeping Still keeping me out of mischief. Are they keeping you out of mischief? Ah well . Oh aye. Oh aye. Okay Agnes . okay, Right, thanks very much, Doctor . cheerio now. Cheerio. Yes sir, what can I do for you ? I was er I woke up Monday morning right, and I had that and the Monklands on Tuesday, right? Because, and they told m he t he told me to come and see Aye. my doctor in a couple of days to see how it was. Ah, that's not ready for opening yet, Steven. Did they give you any antibiotics? . Aye, he gave me, he gave me some tablets I don't know whether What, what sort of stuff did they give you? I don't know the name of actually. That's it. Erm It was a wee capsule, brown capsule. What brown? Brown and brown and white? Aye I think it was. Ah, is it, is that penicillin? Mhm. Yeah. There's a form penicillin in that. What sometimes happens you s it sometimes comes up to a wee yellow head. Aye. And when it does that, you can put a needle in there and just all the stuff comes out all the yellow stuff that's underneath. How many of the er wee capsules have you got left Steven? Oh, maybe about half the About half the amount? Aye. About maybe about half. Right. take See you do. Is it four? Or three a day or four a day. Three or four a day. four. Er I would keep on with those right till they're finished and then come up towards the end of next week. Let's have a look at it again. Mhm. It might be ready for opening, or it might just have dissolved away itself. Aye. Sometimes it dissolves away itself. But occasionally that one it's sort of in between, it could come out Aye. to the surface. Get a needle and . Or it may dissolve away itself? Yeah. Or it might disappear itself, but don't put, don't go putting bandages on it. Don't put leave it alone. And it will go either it will come up to the surface itself or it'll just disappear. Mm. It depen it depends on your own system but it's come up a wee bit . Aye and what happens is, it usually starts in at the corner of your finger Aye. and then it spreads down towards your knuckle. Aye, well, that's That's what's happening. It sometimes goes the, the colour as it, as it starts to heal up the, colour gets a wee bit lighter Aye. and ste starts to spread down towards your next knuckle. Mm. That's okay. No terrible worry about that Steven. Right. That's okay. And er That's fine.. . See I've been getting a kind of rash on my face Mhm. Right. even see it now, there. Yeah. You can see it quite clearly. And you're Can you? getting it on your forehead Aye. as well. Aye. . Aye. see like, see like some kind of spots for the past few Yeah. months and it's it's annoying me . Right. I mean I got that one, see it? Yes. Aye. And it's gone away yet, I mean that's been there about three we about three weeks. Right . Now, once you've, once you've finished this penicillin stuff the hospital have given you, Mm. I want you to go onto this. It's a tablet that you take, one in the morning and one before you go to bed at night. Mhm. And that's for your er for your skin. And that'll give it a good help.. So am I to take that with Not while you're the penicillin? not while you're taking the penicillin. Just finish the penicillin first? Finish your penicillin first Steven and then Mm. Take that. and then start on this stuff. Is that for my skin? This is for your skin. Right. Ah cos th m people won't my skin about . Aye. That's rubbish . You know what I mean? That's rubbish. Don't listen to half of what they say . And my, my granddad was telling me to see my eyes. Mhm. Mm. Eyes. Now I know I went to a sp a specialist and that I mean it just keeps on coming back you know, maybe I'll That's right. Aye. just have to keep on . Aye. No. That's part of the skin problem as well. Is it? Aye. That's part of the skin problem. Is it really? Once you get started on this It should? it'll die away as well. Oh, that's good cos . No problem. No terrible problem there, Steven. But don't mix these with your penicillin. Right. Finish your penicillin first and then and then go penicillin first. on to that. Right. And that'll get it sorted and come back up Aye I'll I'll put appointment just in case you know Mhm. what I mean? Yes. For next week. Aye. ev even with your skin. I mean don't be frightened to come back and see us about that Aye. because it can last for anything up to six months. This spots Aye. on your skin. So I mean Aha. y you might need a wee these tablets Again. maybe two or three times again. And if you do, don't be frightened to come back. Right. Okay, Steven. No bother. Right. We'll see how things are doing next week. Right. Right. Thanks Doctor . Right. Cheerio now. Cheerio. Well Mr , what can we do for you today? Busy today is it not? we just don't believe it. about an hour I've been out there. Oh aye. I can believe it. Due a line today are you? Yes Doctor. I've been sitting here since two o'clock my two o'clock cup of coffee. Not very funny Doctor. I wasn't expecting you'd be that busy just now. Oh. Holidays. Never come at holiday weekend. Mhm. Always the same, before the Christmas, before New Year. It doesn't matter. I mean you can go up on the rest of the week, but the day before the holiday and the day after the holiday the Closed on Monday? Aye. Well you'll get a day off there eh? Or do you? Are you on call-out work? No. I've just got a big case full of paperwork to do when I get There's no rest ? Ah no. Keeps me out of mischief. I'll just be betting horses or chasing women or something like that. Oh you'd better do the last one Doctor it saves you money. If you bet on horses or drink then it cost you money. And that's not . Oh I don't know. I don't know. When you're ready what would be what things will we shall we start with? Well erm sort of how how you how you became involved in the erm in the strike. In the strike, are we starting off with this stuff? Yes. Not now? Yes now. Oh. Well we started off and we were working for . And we and then we had been working for him for about ten or eleven years on this contract that he had for us. And erm his son came along to take over from him. And he put a new table in the mill. And erm being as he put a new table in the mill he thought we could work for thirty pound a week less, on this table. And we could produce more slate on erm thirty pound a week less in wages. Well none of the lads were prepared to take that on, cos we'd been on this contract with for the last eleven years. And was quite happy and all the workers was happy until this son came along . And that's what's got us fixed in all this trouble. You said that you'd worked erm quite happily for er t t Oh yeah everybody was happy. Yeah. Aha. Can you give me some idea of erm h how you started up with him in the first place? Well he bought this slate quarry to scrap it. I believe he er didn't give much for the quarry. But somebody put him on there was slate to be had, only a if you had a machine to clear. And he started clearing to get this slate, and he got at the slate quite quick. But we were working for him then for fourteen pound a week. And make preparing the mill ready for the slate. To ma make putting fixing new tables in and that. And erm anyway we got more from the unemployment exchange that prepared to work for him for fourteen pound, when we could have a eighteen pound on the dole. Four pound a week more on the dole, cos we were having elected earnings and tax rebates on the dole and it and it made it up to eighteen pound. And we were working for for fourteen pound at that time. I sup erm at that time was there a a a a lot of men who had work in the quarries Well on the dole? Well everybody that was working for him had always worked in the quarries all their life, and they er they just been working for the slater company before the quarry shut down. And that's the time they were put off work when the quarry, of the why the quarry shut it, they had too much expense on the electricity to pump the water from this from the mine. That's why er the quarry shut. Or the quarry would have carried on with this slate mine. How many p people d di did he take on at that time then, when he first took over ? There was about six to start with. How did he select them? Well he knew they were all slate quarry workers, and that's how he went on to them. He knew they were all slate quarry workers and they were prepared to work the slate again. Every one of them. Were they were they men who had erm a l lot of expertise in in in the slate? Yes all their lives you know they'd worked. We've all worked in these slate mines since we left school. I I left school before the war when I was fourteen, we all went in the slates. Cos everybody was working in the slate then. Hundreds of men working in the slates. My fathers and grandfathers all worked in the slate, they seen nothing only slate. And when the war broke out of course, everybody left the mines. Cos there was more money Wales. It's sort of pale innit? Which one? Which one? And the daffs are still looking nice! Tomorrow is it,coming here? No. Oh. No, Violet was It'll be Easter won't it? Next week, the week after or something? Well I thought, she's coming down with Martin and Uncle Marvin and all that, and she's going to be here for dinner, now she isn't! Oh. going up the step. They look a lot better than they did last year! Well they've spread it now. What about this poor thing in the corner? Come in ruddy cat! You come in. It's a late one. Two week. Oh is it? Oh! Come in ! Here, you alright now? You got a white one. What? There's a lot of white ones! There the ones you brought in er Are they? white. Undo it all. There's an animal up there. Oh! Oh yeah, they were a mix! She did get a few out of one bag and a few out of another. , but I said I didn't want er Narcite Aren't those funny? Those two that you had in , you'd of thought they'd have bloomed quicker, but there's they're like that! Oh yeah ! What happened to them? Growth perhaps? See them go, well they have now! Well, they've been up there long enough now to To spread. Yeah I know. Tried the again? Mm. Mm mm, I think the cat's are trying to ruin it! This is a miserable old lot here! That one's quite pretty, it's this bloody cable here! Oh I like that one! Well I think he's quite pretty! Poor old cactus! First it's erm it's erm they're too small! They're not ! No, well you want to put it in that front lawn . There's enough in that bloody front lawn, I don't know where ca about it! Know what to think about. I didn't know what to suggest about it. Well there is not because that doesn't seem to right I think they're guarding their van! Oh, there's plenty in there now. Ah, but this is the better of the two. A flaming lorry load of stuff! Ah but they, I don't know i ,i , if I dunno. I can't answer! Moving the or something. Put the bloody paraffin on it and burn the lot off! by the roots you see. It's the roots that you've gotta get them by the top. Leave for three years. Oh good! No, take the paper. Oh no! Yes that's right. Yeah, that's it. Here you are then! Nothing on the telly is there? Go and collect my bits out there. Oh no look at that! Right then ! Go and collect all my bits. Well have you finished . And they were forty what? Forty two. Let's have a look. La la la la, la la ah la la la la la mm mm mmm mm mm mm mm mm mm Fisherman's friend . Which friend are they talking about then? I said do you go to ? Oh! .It's for a . Are you coping then? Ay retire soon. Oh, so they're retired? Mm. They still don't they? . don't do anything! Tomorrow go and do the lawn. Christmas I think was the last time. What is the date today? Twentieth. Twentieth. Tomorrow is the first day of spring. Mhm. Hopefully! You eating some more potato? They just swapped another . Labour did? He made his press speech this morning saying that she couldn't even cos he thought that go down the hospital. And he saw many patients. Well that's what Norman Tebbit's telling him isn't it? Open the book. No and It isn't! It was about the same. He's already made the statement this time. And he was telling the opposite! And . Oh dear! gonna get the push first! Mm? Well I seems like every bank's lending! Just let me have the today. They should know after their Mm? game. Ha! went to Bolton yesterday. Ey he said. In his He had a rollocking there! He said that the they, him and Linda pack up. Yeah. And then him and Nora is. Norma. Norma. And police protection, get out of the town! He's gonna find a lot of that! Well when he gets in the right places he's only been doing schools and you know? Hazel knows nothing about it. That's the first time he said yesterday he says will you do something to Yeah and then you know he knows that er the su ,ones. But he hadn't been out in the That's why world yet! Mind you, that had always . Mm. That wasn't her earlier. No, but she was always out there. Never slept through! Oh yeah. And I don't think his wife is that type of woman. She can't stand that bit of pressure! Well Wait till the eggs start flying! painful You!which is strong I agree. strong conservative Very well! strong! Have you Oh! maybe she does deal with Ooh! with the conservatives. Five, six er Mm. Do you wanna watch it before I tape over it? Cos it's really worth watching! Is it? That is bound to get some stick! Ooh! What's that? I'm not gonna ! Cos like they say yesterday er . It's their down the road. I was really amazed at the people every time going round spoke the chair Mm! they're so staunch conservative! They have five seats in Bedfordshire they're all taken with conservatives! Good Lord! Only one side of them is crisp. work for her before they go. I'm fighting working harder they can't clear what they said what's happening without the other group coming. They're fighting with their lives aren't they? Yeah. Probably have to work harder! But they're not, they're not going to get anywhere are they? What is Major's job when he isn't Prime Minister? I'll tell you which his job is,. Not at all? Dunno. He used to work You mean the cabinet? He used to work in the dock's offices. Yeah. As a clerk. No, I know he was that. The next Prime Minister will get him a job, see. Won't he? Anything. Well he'll have a nice lot of money when he finished being Prime Minister. . Mm mm. Yeah,. Oh! And I can't There's too much of that P D R and Z Y X business! Ey And what's it mean? representation. What it is anyway proposal representation are being sent out if anybody down here you'll go into England if I voted conservative you know, just say for example it wouldn't be the one past the post it'll be the one with the most votes That'll get the job. that'll get the job for the county. Mm. And that's what it is. No. Anyway he says it will be decided upon cos it's the half an hour to go at it, you watch in the end . He said if there's one thing I always carry quite close to my heart and if you'll just give me a minute I'll take out. And he read this this P R and he said this is from a junior minister, Conservative minister in nineteen eighty four wro wrote these words in a book and he says that up and coming Conservative young minister was none other than than Chris Patten. And he was sat right next to him. He didn't know anything about this and he had to admit, he did say this! This . But now, he says, it'll change his mind. Mm To change his mind. You should of heard the people in the audience! Well you can change your mind if you want to! Yes but he wrote a book called this because he thought that er the conservatives were losing . And they thought they were . Yeah. And all he could say to them was ! Nineteen eighty three. Well what's gonna come in to save them this time? They're hoping fall all back down again that they're gonna fall back. Fa You reckon? go back again. And they think other people will change their minds. To keep the same Prime Minister now. You're wrong! I like gentleman. Boos, jeers and some tense moments as the Queen receives the keys of Nicosia. And acquitted, the doctor who prescribed cannabis to save her daughter from death of serious bodily harm. A judge at the Old Bailey has jailed an Irish terrorist for twenty five years for plotting a massive I R A bomb attack in Central London. Patrick Kelly who's forty one was also found guilty of attempting to murder one of the police officers who foiled the plot. P C Raymond Hall was shot last November in North London when he tried to arrest Kelly and an accomplice who were in a lorry which was found to be packed with more than three tonnes of explosives. The intuition of two unarmed policemen thwarted the I R A's attempt to plant the biggest ever bomb in the capital. On patrol in North London in the early hours of the morning, they became suspicious about a seven tonne lorry. Part of the number plate was obscured and it had been badly resprayed. It was hardly surprising the two occupants made such a quick getaway when stopped. Three and a half tonnes of home made explosives were inside, needing only seconds to prime. The device was three times the size of the Baltic Exchange bomb and would have devastated buildings within three hundred yards. Giving chase down a side road, one of the policemen challenged two men. One of them pulled out a revolver aiming it inches away from P C Ray Hall's nose. He ducked instinctively and the bullet grazed his head. He felt a second shot hit him in the back and knock him off his feet. He survived to tell an Old Bailey court of his miraculous escape. P C Hall, a former Royal Engineer, who served in the Falklands war before joining the police, said he was convinced he was going to die. Police believe Patrick Kelly was the driver of the lorry in North London rather than the gunman. He had an unlikely background for a terrorist. With convictions in England for gross indecency and importuning. Although he was found guilty in Dublin of kidnapping, he was not a known I R A man. But he and the suspect who escaped, were intent on repeating the mayhem of the City of London explosion eight months earlier. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Leonard told Kelly, the public needed protection from him. His bomb would have caused enormous damage and more importantly, could have killed anyone in the area. The judge said P C Hall's bravery in preventing the attack deserved the highest commendation. Er I joined the police five years ago with the intention of helping and serving the public and I think er last year I done it. And today the public have er returned their gesture in honour of me in the returning of the guilty verdict. What I done on that night was no more than any other police officer does or would do in the same situation. As he spoke, Patrick Kelly was driven away to begin his twenty five year sentence. Neil Bennet, B B C News, at the Old Bailey. A twenty one year old student has been cleared at the Old Bailey of raping another student after a drunken Christmas party. Austin Donnellan went on trial at his own insistence because he said he was unhappy with the way the disciplinary committee at London University's King's College was dealing with the case. Cleared of rape, Austin Donnellan stepped out of the Old Bailey and stepped into an angry scum of photographers and reporters fighting to get close to him. His case, involving an allegation that he raped another student after going out with her, has attracted wide media attention. Almost inaudible in the crush, he thanked everyone who'd helped him in the case. I'm especially grateful to my friends who supported me by giving evidence. Mr Donnellan who's twenty one and the woman were students at King's College in London. The court heard how last Christmas they both went to a dance, the woman got very drunk and they ended up back at her room. The court was told she'd alleged she was unconscious when he had sex with her. But he told the court it was quite the opposite. She was not a dead piece of meat, he said, but very energetic in bed. She encouraged sex. Donnellan said that if at any time she'd wanted him to stop, he would have done. The court heard the police became involved in the case at Mr Donnellan's insistence. The woman student and King's College wanted the matter dealt with by the University's disciplinary committee. But Mr Donnellan claimed they wanted him to admit a lesser charge to get him out of the college quietly. He said he refused to accept this because he was not guilty of anything. The college were going to try the issue before a pr private almost secret little disciplinary committee containing academics and students. And he didn't want that. He wanted it tried out in the open and for his name to be cleared. Decisively and that's happened now. Mr Donnellan's tutor said the case was important because it dealt with such a sensitive issue. The key point to me was as soon as he said n as she said, No, he stopped. In my book that's not rape. And it seems not in the jury's book either and I'm very glad of it. Moved by the verdict, Mr Donnellan's mother said she was proud he'd taken the case to the police in order to clear himself. The family are now celebrating at a secret location. Triona Holden, B B C News, the Old Bailey. Women's groups have responded angrily to the jury's decision to clear Austin Donnellan of rape. And the case has again raised the question of what constitutes consent to sex. Scenes like this leading to brief encounters between couples who may scarcely know each other, can some say, cause confusion about sexual etiquette. Is it reasonable for a woman to invite a man to her bedroom, even to undress and get into bed, and still reserve the right to refuse penetrative sex? It shouldn't be, Okay, we're in bed together, we're gonna have sex whether you want to or not. If someone changes their mind, they have that prerogative. Er and if someone isn someone might be getting into bed and and not intending to have sex then that's fine as well. However others of an older generation say women should know the risks they take once they take their clothes off. The male sex drive being what it is, the chances of his being able to stop are less perhaps than she realizes. There is a point for many men which they regard as the point of no return. And as I say, if they are perfect men, maybe they can take a deep breath and stop just like that. But some men can't. Students at London University were almost unanimous today in saying a couple going to bed together didn't necessarily mean the woman consents to sex. If the woman has asked him to stop, if she has changed her mind and doesn't want to go through with with the action o of intercourse or whatever, then the man should stop. Everybody's very confused by it. Most sex is probably nearer to rape, particularly in one's early years. And we might like to give credit for And I think it's really hard to learn to read the signs. Both parties, the man and the woman should always be in control of the situation and if for some reason they want things to stop, should have the authority and the power to do that. But some were less sure. I think if a girl got into bed with you er no clothes, I think the intention to have sex is very clear. I'm against rape but definitely if a woman er goes to a man's bed then it's quite er er sensible that if a man expects to have sex with that woman. Simple as that. However, social historians say couples having non-penetrative sex goes back a long way. A practice called bundling was quite common in the past. With an unmarried couple in a bed with a bolster down the middle. They'd just be in their underwear and er it's er there's certain evidence that they engaged in what we would call heavy petting nowadays. Some women say the old idea that a man is uncontrollable past a certain point is absurd. Consent from a woman needs to be gained at every stage during sex, even once a couple are in bed. But others say that this definition of rape will undermine the progress made so far in getting the courts to take rape seriously. It was only two years ago that rape by husbands became illegal. Polly Toynbee. The Prime Minister has again made it clear he has no intention of scrapping plans to put V A T on fuel and power. During Prime Minister's questions. the Labour leader John Smith urged the government to abandon what he called these foolish proposals. But Mr Major said extension of V A T was a vital part of policies to reduce public borrowing, earlier the Prime Minister presided over a cabinet discussion of the options for next month's budget. The cabinet's discussion was hampered by deep uncertainty about the strength of the recovery. Views differed on how much any increase in taxes could threaten the move out of recession. The most cheerful remarks seemed to have been made about the health of Michael Heseltine, who was making his first appearance at the cabinet since his heart attack. The Prime Minister led the welcome, there were cries of, hear hear and a ritual banging of the cabinet table. The chancellor kept his cards very close to his chest. He intends to wait until the last moment before making the vital decision on taxes. Mr Major told the commons that the recovery does seem to have taken root. And he made clear that despite the government's small majority, they would be prepared to take difficult decisions about how to reduce the enormous government deficit. The reality is that we need to cope with the fiscal deficit and we have the courage to do so. The labour leader opened up an Autumn offensive against the extension of V A T. Does the Prime Minister have the remotest appreciation of the overwhelming hostility throughout this nation to imposing V A T on domestic fuel. In addition to its obvious unfairness, is there not now evidence that the governments tax increases impel consumer confidence and any hope of a recovery. In these circumstances will the Prime Minister now abandon these foolish proposals. Well I think the er right honourable gentleman knows for both I and my right honourable friend the chancellor have made the position quite clear, that the extra value added tax is a vital part of our policies to get public borrowing down but that we will be offering help to people who are vulnerable. If the tax Madam speaker, is as obnoxious as the right honourable gentleman claims, then why did the Labour conference vote and I quote, For a general shift in taxation towards energy resource use? What is that other than VAT? The unpopularity of the V A T increase was a key factor in the Liberal Democrats victory in the Christchurch by-election. The government's majority is now down to seventeen. Getting a tough budget through the commons won't be easy. John Sergeant, B B C News, Westminster. The chancellor's team of independent economic advisors, the so- called seven wise men, have urged him not to do anything in his budget next month to damage the recovery. They've called for the gradual introduction of tax increases balanced by a reduction in interest rates. The chancellor's plans are always the subject of intense speculation as budget day approaches. At the conference of town planners today, he expressed the treasury's customary disdain for most of it. Strong rumours that I'm about to tax everything that moves and doesn't move. And this has er been an experience of every chancellor before. Er most of the accounts of what I'm discussing er are pretty well near fiction. Er a and er they will certainly remain secret until I produce my budget. But the rumours reflect merely what everyone knows, events are conspiring to make this budget a particularly difficult one. The chancellor's major budget headache is that the government is fifty billion pounds in the red. To reduce that borrowing figure, he could cut spending. But the overall expenditure total for next year has already been agreed and it's unlikely that much more could be pared from it. That leaves Mr Clarke with the option of raising taxes. But higher taxes mean that consumers and businesses have less money to spend. And that could damage the prospects for recovery. In their thrice yearly report, the treasury's panel of independent advisors express concern about the economies fragility. They're against large tax increases next month. Instead they want to see a more gradual approach backed by a cut in interest rates. We do think that there is a need to increase tax receipts further over the medium term from nineteen ninety five onwards by about one percentage point of G D P, about seven billion pounds. But we do not think the chancellor should raise taxes much next year because the recovery is too weak to accept that. Figures out today suggested those fears about recovery are well founded. Consumer spending appears to be slowing. The panel believe lower interest rates are needed to boost flagging demand. But they think the chancellor will have no choice but to increase taxes in the longer term as the economic climate improves. The message to the chancellor is a clear one, don't tax now, tax later. But he knows that later means closer to the next election. And while it may be economically desirable to raise taxes then, it might prove politically impossible. Gerry Baker, B B C News, as the treasury. About a hundred Greek Cypriot demonstrators booed and jeered the Queen today as she was handed the keys of Nicosia. The divided capital of Cyprus. The demonstrators want Britain to apologize for the executions of nine men who fought for the island's independence in the fifties. Here's our Middle Eastern correspondent Michael Macmillan. In Nicosia's old city, a couple of hundred right wing Eoka supporters chanted, The Queen is a traitor, we don't want you here. Inside the walls at Famagusta Gate, the shouting could still be heard as the Queen was presented with the key to the city by the Mayor of Nicosia. Those opposed to the Queen's visit had demanded that she be refused the honour both here and in Limassol. It was an uncomfortable affair, the Mayor used it as an occasion to condemn what he called the Turkish occupation of the North of the island and Douglas Hurd looked on clearly anxious that the whole thing be wound up as soon as possible. The chaos continued as they reversed the Queen's Rolls Royce for a quick departure. Her press secretary looked worried. As did her driver. And Mr Hurd who's angered the Greek Cypriots by his plans to meet the Turkish Cypriot leader, declined to comment. He was booed as well. The Queen emerged to more protests but finally forced a smile before she was driven away. Elsewhere in Nicosia there were several arrests and in one incident police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd. It was a day in which the Queen was anxious to leave the past behind and to the end she made a point of meeting Argentinian soldiers who form part of the U N contingent here. It has been a difficult day for the Queen and tonight she's been snubbed following the decision by the municipality of Limassol not to present her with the keys to the town. The palace is playing it all down but clearly this visit is not going according to plan. Michael Macmillan, B B C News, Nicosia, Cyprus. The time is six sixteen and still to come, big supermarket chains line up to try to stop American style shopping in Britain. The supermarkets say warehouse club shopping should be subject to the same planning laws as they are. And Benazir Bhutto is back as Pakistan's Prime Minister for the second time. A doctor who gave cannabis to her sick daughter has been cleared of criminal charges at Liverpool Crown Court. Dr Anne denied supplying cannabis. She said she gave it to her daughter because she believed it was the only drug which could help alleviate her condition. She said she'd been following a higher moral law. The trial lasted a week. Dr always insisting that she wasn't campaigning for the legalization of cannabis. For ten years, Anne who ran a G P practice from her home at Wallasey, tried to obstruct her daughter taking cannabis because she thought it would do her harm. The court heard that Lucy who is thirty three has suffered a serious and intractable illness for thirteen years. Eventually her mother became convinced cannabis could help after reading evidence from doctors in the United States. The s' family priest says the conflict between medicine and law put a tremendous strain on the doctor. As a doctor she would be i in the dilemma of of trying to give her daughter something which er is not allowed, and yet as a as a doctor she could prescribe other things for other people and here she is as a mother with her own child in her own house, unable to to do anything very much for her. It took the jury less than an hour to clear Dr . What she did she did clearly for the benefit of her daughter who was unwell, as any normal natural mother would in the circumstances. What what are you going to do now? I want to go and have a gin and tonic. A double gin. Dr 's defence had been legally unusual, that of necessity. She believed that supplying cannabis to her daughter was morally right in the medical circumstances. John Thorne, B B C News, Liverpool. Two men who ran Britain's biggest ecstasy smuggling gang have each been jailed for twenty four years at Maidstone Crown Court. The men, Ronald Maine and Ronald Johnson, headed an international operation, smuggling drugs worth and estimated fifty eight million pounds. Two accomplices were also jailed for their part in the operation. The supermarket chains, Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway have applied to the high court to try to stop the opening in this country of an American style warehouse club. Costco is due to open a club at Thurrock in Essex next month and is able to cut prices by keeping overheads low. It's classified as a wholesaler but the supermarkets say Costco should be subject to the same planning rules as retailers. This is the development that's upsetting Britain's supermarket giants. A huge warehouse that's nearing completion at Thurrock in Essex, and which offers the kind of discounts already enjoyed by millions of Americans. Like this Boston store, warehouse clubs are open to members only and though they're pitched at businesses, individuals can join too if they can show they've a steady income and pay their thirty dollar subscription. For that they get access to anything from food to car tyres. Mostly well known brands at up to fifty percent less than they'd pay elsewhere. I need to have three of four hundred dollars because before you even get through the store, you just buy. I believe that the large supermarkets have had it too good for too long. They've had tremendous power in the market place with no competition. American supermarkets have hit back by cutting many of their prices and printing more money off coupons. They save this woman over twenty pounds a trip. Like our own superstores, they stock a much wider range of goods than the warehouses, but experts say supermarkets in Britain should be worried if the clubs do take off here. Unless they dramatically change the way they do business, they're going to have problems, they won't go away certainly. I mean people are always going to want to want the convenience of er driving to a nearby established supermarket, but their profit margins will decline. But the big three supermarket chains deny their high court action is to kill off Costco. They say they simply want clubs to be subject to the same planning restrictions they face. They're promoting themselves to a very significant extent on the basis that they're selling at cheaper prices to the public. That means in my book that they're er doing retailing. Er if they're retailers then they should er comply with retail regulations as does any other retailer in the United Kingdom. Costco has already put in a second application to answer some of the criticisms. But supermarkets have hinted that they may challenge that in the courts as well. John Andrew, B B C News. Benazir Bhutto has been sworn in as Prime Minister of Pakistan for the second time after a decisive victory in the country's parliament over her greatest rival, the Muslim League leader, Nawa Shariff. But her Pakistan people's party must wait until tomorrow to find out if it has the power that comes with control of the key state of Punjab. After days of coalition building, Benazir Bhutto could only wait to see if it had paid off. Nawa Shariff lost the election and he's lost the battle for the independence and members of minority parties who hold the balance of power. The count was a hundred and twenty one for Benazir Bhutto, seventy two for Nawa Shariff. And from the Prime Minister's chair, a word for the loser. Pakistani voters watched the drama unfold. . a short drive from the capital, is one of the Punjab cities where Nawa Shariff is strongest. His control of the Punjab Assembly neutralized Benazir Bhutto's last administration. The former military dictator General Zir-El-Haaq is still revered here. His son sits in the National Assembly for Nawa Shariff's party. We have all come out with er with the worst er scenario ever er in the er democratic history of Pakistan. And any government which is going to be formed in the centre I don't think it is going to last for too long. Benazir Bhutto says that after the summer of turmoil in Pakistan, this could be the last chance for parliamentary democracy. Everyone knows that if this time round, there is political instability, it may be a long time before Pakistan gets yet another chance at election. But for now the army is prepared to watch and wait. As Benazir Bhutto was sworn in the news came in that her choice for speaker had been elected in Punjab. The first indication that tomorrow she could take the state. Benazir Bhutto looks to be strong but it's a coalition of convenience not conviction, in a country where politics follows the rules of war, opposition means nothing, winning is everything. Tonight Benazir Bhutto is winning. David Loin, B B C News, Islamabad. The Welsh Secretary, John Redwood, told the House of Commons today that the Welsh Development Agency had tightened up its procedures in the wake of a highly critical report. In July the Commons public accounts committee attacked the W D A for its management practices and for making unauthorized redundancy payments worth more than a million pounds. The Agency's chief executive has since resigned, another director left today and two other directors have been disciplined. Our industry correspondent Stephen Evans reports. Why have forty five Japanese companies chose Wales as their European launch pad? The Agency has painted the brightest picture of Wales around the world. Spending a hundred and seventy one million pounds a year to draw countless foreign firms. But the image was tarnished by the public accounts committee report. Neil Smith, guilty of fraud, became marketing director and interviewed models in a hotel. Redundancy pay of one point four million pounds was said to be excessive. The Agency's chief executive resigned yesterday. One other official has gone, two demoted or reprimanded. Procedures are to be tightened. The independent panel that I appointed in July as you are aware, reported yesterday. Its recommendations are severe. However they are comprehensive. And it has given the board opportunity to take the necessary action. In Parliament this afternoon the debate was over where responsibility lies. It is clear from the report that my predecessors were not to blame and that the primary responsibility lay at exept executive level in the W D A and I suggest honourable members opposite read the report . Is it any wonder given such casual leadership from the Welsh Office, that standards in the Agency itself fell to such unacceptable levels. This man's done a fabulous job. The Welsh Development Agency, fabulous job. But the Prime Minister of the time's favourite W D A head Dr Gwynne Jones has now gone. As Wales seeks growth, the dilemma for the Agency is how to get a commercial go-getting mentality on public money with public control. The government wants devolved decision making. But then tight audits. Labour fears privatization. Stephen Evans, B B C News. A bill to grant posthumous pardons to all three hundred and seven British soldiers who were executed in the first world war, has gained a formal first reading in the house of commons. The MP who introduced the bill said many of the men who were shot for cowardice were in fact suffering from shell shock. A village churchyard across the muddy fields from the Somme bears testimony to the British soldiers found to have failed their country. Condemned as cowards, deserters, they were shot by their own side in a war which wiped out much of a generation. In the first terrible hours of battle, twenty thousand died as they advanced into the German's heavy artillery and machine guns. One suicidal attack followed another every soldier wavered between courage and fear. In a regiment which had two men shot for cowardice, Reg Glen, now a hundred, says those executed didn't deserve dishonour or death. It was shell shock. There was a er no doubt it was a disease. And it could attack anybody. And er more likely to be people of a nervous disposition. Those men who finally couldn't face going over the top from these trenches on the Somme, met with summary justice. They had little chance to defend themselves at their court marshal, they weren't properly represented and there was very little right of appeal. The firing squads met at dawn. Just behind these front lines. Corporal Harry Farr was shot for cowardice in October nineteen sixteen. At the Somme memorial to those with no known grave, his granddaughter wants a posthumous pardon, to finally purge the shame her family had sought to hide for three generations. My mother didn't know until she was in her mid forties. And she only learnt from somebody else that her father had been executed. It was a dreadful stigma. MP Andrew McKinley says records at the Imperial war museum clearly show the brutality of battlefield justice. His bill now goes forward for a second reading but stands a slim chance of becoming law. Executed May nineteen sixteen. Dear oh dear. The families of those shot at dawn, still hope that Ministers who say they won't rewrite history, may yet change their minds and give every victim of the great war, the same respect. Mike Donkin, B B C News, The Somme. And tonight's main news again, an Irish terrorist Patrick Kelly, has been sent to prison for twenty five years for plotting a bomb attack in Central London and attempting to murder a policeman who stopped the lorry packed with explosives. A London University graduate has been cleared of raping a student after a party. And Greek Cypriot demonstrators jeered the Queen as she received the keys of Nicosia.

I mean, Birmingham is over run with rats! They're everywhere! London's the same! That's the sewer rats. Awful isn't it! They just multiply in there's millions of them! Why don't they do something about it? And th , think they're having a real problem in Birmingham as well the they're, trying to get rid of them and they're down the sewers all the time trying to get rid of the bloody things! Cos they're coming up you see Yeah. See any crack in the drain or anything like that, all of their burrowing and they'll get through it! Mm. And that's what they're doing, they're coming into peoples gardens and rushing down the sewers again, you know? Mark's playing pool tonight. We went to erm a party on Saturday one of the men that he works with, it was his fiftieth birthday and of course fifty years ago was the war wasn't it, nineteen forty two? Yeah. And er it was brilliant, the disco was! It was on the, the theme was the nineteen forties and Mm. it was fancy dress! I mean we didn't know this, well Mark knew, but I didn't know and there was some as Germans and some as English forces it was really good and it got erm the D J got all the old records and all that really was a good night! And th , the er buffet that somebody had do erm, I tell you who did it, Brian, you know Brian the tyre man? Yeah. His wife had done the buffet with Clarice remember Clarice? Yeah. Aunty they call her or something. Oh yeah , I've seen her recently, yeah. Yeah they di Was it goo buffet good? Yeah. Was it a good buffet, yeah? Very good. Cos they do that sort of thing now. Yeah they'd done the buffet and it was all it was in blue red blue and white. Mm. It was really good! A very, very good night it was. That's where you met Colin and told him I was having a new car. Yes I did. I thought I'll give him something to talk about at the garage. Yeah, I couldn't remember his name you know I know now, Colin yeah. I can remember Brian I couldn't remember Colin's name. He sat with us, him and his wife. They're a nice couple they're alright. They was telling, telling us about their son cos he's got erm a Nintendo game system, same as Mm. ours and apparently he's supposed to be brilliant on it! He knows all the short cuts and gets thousands and thousands of points on it! Mhm. I'm the highest I've got is a hundred thousand so far, Mark's up to two hundred and fifty thousand! Is he? Mind you, he plays it more than me ! It's entertaining though I mean I can understand why kids get addicted to them cos once you start, you can't stop yo you think Yeah. to yourself I'll do better next time and I'll do better next time and it's, it's all the time I must try harder next time! I mean a, I'm a little bit different cos I would, I'd you know me, I don't like putting money in anything cos I I don't like to to lose money through a a lost cause sort of thing. You twenty five Ded? Twenty eighty! Mm. I wish I was twenty five ! Well that's side A and get a couple done today it won't look so bad. So what's it for then? Get your coat on! Ay What's it for? A survey on the British language? Yeah. Ricky! Rick! Where's he going ay Are you ready Rick? Where are we going? I'll just lock up. I've got mine. the door. What sh , what shall we get what shall I get Mary for her birthday? Don't ask me! Hey? Don't ask me! What I'm doing is I'm taking her out. The girls I think Jo , Jean and George are coming down so Oh that'll be nice. if you wanna come out with us for a meal erm we're gonna go to The Fox. Oh yeah. And then we're going way up Chester, taking her up Chester. All pay for ourselves. Well I'll have to pay for Jean and George anyway. Well you don't have to pay for us though, don't worry about us. Erm I'll have to pay , cos I've got no money. Oh that's alright. So I'll put it Erm on my Access. We went out for Sunday lunch cos I don't work Sundays any more. Yeah, I know,, they're catching up are they or are pac , are they closed down? No, they just want the office closed. They don't wanna pay me you see! Who's, who's there to cash then? So nobody! What about ? They want in the office, I've gotta sort it out Monday. Take your time. Well we did. It's like erm yesterday I Don't get many figures. no yesterday we had er two, two tills one was fifty pound short and one was twenty pounds up! Well I found the twenty pound in the end but the fifty pound we couldn't find it, we checked everything so i fortunately I said to I had them re-checked on Monday during the day for cash up Yeah. and I said to Andrea, I says Andrea those two are two of the tills I'd checked yesterday in the middle of the day and they were spot on I said that money went yesterday evening! And, have you found it? No. Oh you haven't, you know where to find it if you want? Oh yeah. I got the keys Which way are you going? Well I'll go up this way, haven't combed my hair . Shouldn't worry about it mine never looks like it's been combed in any case! You know what next door's done? Somebody said it was next door. The rubbish ! The rubbish! Mary told me ! Well I mean It was terrible down here wasn't it ? wouldn't of done it. Ah they wouldn't of put it behind your car. If he had of done, it would Leonard's, not the other side. He wouldn't of put it behind the car I mean some people are stupid but Well I co , I've seen him bringing out bringing it out in bags it falls out of there! I'm not saying it was her . Are they three, three bedrooms? These along here? Oh those, I should think so, yeah. Yeah. This cos er You can't, cos you couldn't have inside. Mm didn't like the look of that one inside. God, we used to come here when we were kids you know? On the way to school. And we used to ha , we used to come down here some some evenings a gang of us remember I used to look ever so small Yeah. and you seemed ever so big at the time ! It's funny innit? Went on about erm do you remember the penny chews, like the Mm mm. the black jacks and that? Yeah. We was on about those the other day cos now they're so tiny Yeah. and when you're kids they seemed so big! in your mouth! Yeah. That's right. And one of the girls said yeah but you've grown since then, I says no, they've shrunk them! They've probably shrunk them anyway. Yeah. God, look at that! They've spent some money on this house, haven't they? It looks nice. Yeah. Ooh, look at those though! Yeah, I don't know what it is. It's pretty! That house is lovely inside. This one the top. If I type that formula in a cell on a spreadsheet. What's the two the name of the file, two greater than the cell address and it er, gets to the data from that cell and that other file. Have you ever done, used these formulae. Anybody used them? By linking formulae. You've used them Linking files together. For linking files together. Right, and there's various pros and cons to be aware of. So that's rather good. So let's demonstrate first of all how they work. I've got a file named sales one. Here it is, and erm, leave these er, on this row er twenty five, I've got a total sales figures, and it's that total sales figure there that I want to pass across into another file. Let me save this file. That's the cell C twenty five that bears the total. I've got a file called income two, and let me just erase what's here first of all. Right, so we'll type a formula into this cell, this is where I want the total sales figure to be. So type plus two less thans, the name of the file, which is sales one, two greater thans, and a cell address, C twenty five and then enter and that number one five four is, you got from that file sales one, in cell C twenty five, and I can copy that formula to the right, just like any other formula, I can copy it. Erm, there we go, and er, we copy right C twenty five E twenty five, that's it. Let me save this file. Letting me go back to the sales file. Have to change some of the numbers. Right, let's save the file. Let's retrieve the, the er, other file back again, and as soon as you retrieve it, updated it,data from the other file. So, as you retrieve it, it's updated the file. That sounds very good. You didn't have to press any buttons, it just did it. Shouldn't that be a range name instead of a cell address? Er, well, yes, we'll come to that. Wh why might you want to do that? of spreadsheets are Sorry? Well, a group of spreadsheets You put re you would want to put range names on the cell. Instead of C twenty five, you have a range name. Is that what you mean? Yeah, well I manually combine at the moment the range names. A number of range names from a number of You file combine? Yeah. Oh, I think what you're trying to say is can you combine a whole range and not just one cell. Right. Well, I'll come back to that. Let me go back to er the inco er the sales file. Let's say we're gonna research a number of products. The product er F write numbers. Here we go. Save it away. Let's retrieve the other one back again the numbers absolute type That's right, erm, I can save it with the row on the other files, but the total is now on row twenty six, but this is still referring to the same cells, C twenty five. Oh. The row twenty five is no now contains a dash blind. Erm, so that's not very good. Erm, at least I spotted it here, and I can rea realize what the problem is. Change that to a twenty six and then copy this er right. But, er, you might not have spotted it, and furthermore, you might have er, referred to another row that contains numbers. Here it was obvious that something was wrong, because you saw a dash. But you could have er, be er could now be referring to a different row that happens to have the same numbers in. Might not seen obviously wrong. So, therefore you get wrong answers. So, this is a big risk with these highlighted formulas, if you do it this way. Of course, we're always going to be inserting and deleting and moving things about, so, er, the risk of this happening will be very high. But there is a solution, and that's to use range names. So let's go back to the file again. Er, I could name that cell with a range name, that cell there, the first cell. range name create, erm, in fact, I've already done it. Th this cell, erm, C twenty six, I've named cell zero one. That cell there. Name cell zero one. Cell zero two. Name that one. E twenty six, I've named zero three, and so on. That's my normal naming convention, my normal naming convention is use the first two letters W L. W I've explained, and L stands for linking. So you have to create a range name for each cell that you're going to link. Let's go back to the other file er, I'm going to put a range name in, cell zero one on that one. Cell zero two on that one. Right, so I, I've put, got the range names on the first two, but not on the others. Let's save this file and then retrieve the er, other one back again. Let's insert yet another product. Type in the numbers save it, retrieve the other one back again. So at least the first two cells are still picking up the right two numbers, because we used the range names, we've inserted a row on the other file, but er, we're still about range names found where those cells are. Whereas here and in that range name it's still referring to row twenty six. So that's the solution. Use the range names when you file formulae. Sorry. I want to erm, go ahead and put files formulae information three files one point one down Yes, Can I do that? yes, you can have diff different opening formulae with a different part name in it. Yes, but no not into the one cell. You have to bring the two separate cells into fourth cell, total number. Yeah. Erm. You can't link a whole range to a whole range, you can only have to one cell. So this a thing you won't like about it, is that if you've got er, thirteen columns and ten rows, that means you have to create hundred and thirty range names, which you won't enjoy doing. Erm, but you really need to do it, cos the risk of things going wrong are very high, you don't Right, let's file I wanted to say a fe a few things about One Two Three Release Three, cos there are some differences on the Windows products. When you retrieve the linked file one two three, release three of four, it doesn't automatically update itself, and it does here. So what do you need to do in order to release three or four? One thing you can do, is do file admin link and that goes and gets the data from the file on the disk. It takes it then. But I don't use it, er, because it's incredibly slow. It can measure it and wait hours. If you've got a, if you're linked to a big file and you got a lot of linking formulae, you can wait hours for it to finish. So you want to avoid it at all costs in release three of four. So what should you do? Well, in release three of four you can have more than one file open at the same time. Let me show you. Here's the first file that I've got, this is the sales file, and, to bring the second file into memory in this, this One Two Three Release Three, you do file open. That leaves this file in memory, but brings another one into memory. Er, might as well move the next one in and that cell's got a file linking formulae which is updated cos of the files in the memory. Let's just create a window, so we can see both files on the screen at the same time. Right, so in the lower window, we've got the sales file, and the upper window we've got the income file. The linking formulae in that cell. If I change a number here, you'll notice,si since I change that number here it recalculates through to the other file. The two files are in memory. When you change one, the other automatically recalculates through. So if you need to pass data across from one file to another in release three or four, they don't convert the files and then they, data transfers across virtually easy Any questions on that. Right, er, we got tea or coffee or a soft drink Ten, fifteen minutes. How long do you need? Well, a little bit about managing your files. Is there a tape recorder in here somewhere? has got it By the wall here. Oh, right. That's why you're quiet over there, is it? So a bit about managing your files. Er, you shouldn't put too many files in one directory, cos then you can't find them, when you're looking for a file. You see a whole list of files you can't retrieve, you get a whole list of appearing. And, er, you probably retrieve half a dozen files before you find the one that you want. Has this happened to you from time to time? You can't remember what you called a certain file, and Yeah. it looks like it might be that one, got to try that one. Not the one. Er, is it this one? No. No, it's not that one. You can retrieve quite a few,wa waste a lot of time, anyway. Erm, what you want to do is to create lots of directories and put different sets of files in different directories. Are you familiar with directories? Yeah. DOS. Making directories. Erm, the analogy is the filing cabinets. Er, you wouldn't have a great big stack of paper in the corner of the room. Well, er, if you did, then if you were looking for something, you couldn't find where it was, you know, you'd have to delve in, and you take ages to find whatever you're looking for. But er, if you file everything away in filing cabinets, then er, you can go to the right filing cabinet, open the right drawer, maybe there's some folders in there. Pick out the right folder, if it's got a tab on it. Then maybe between various other pieces of paper, you find the one that you're after. And, find thing quickly. Erm. So. Erm, you want to put your own computer files in directories in the same way. You ever created a directory? How do you do it? Erm, you have created a sub with DOS. Created a sub-directory, right. In erm, DOS, do you do M D M D, that's right space, back-slash What does M D stand for? Main directory You, if you get the C prompt. You've seen the C prompt, have you? Mhm. And, you wanted to create a, a sub-directory off the root directories known as root directories you would type M D space suppose you wanted to create a directory named put,put your budgets in. Keep them in,press enter. So that creates a sub-directory, off your root directory, called put. You may have a list of directories as well, off the root directory, and then you've got a directory called One Two Three One Two Three programs in. Mhm. And you may have some other directories. Then if you've got one called DOS. Put the DOS programs in there All that, all I can do is pick a file out of my come under One Two Three, but if you do that in Lotus you have to do the one two three first. No, you can create a separate sub-directory. I've got one two three and a black-slash But if you put two three and I put in in the sub-directory. Yeah, that's what I mean, you have to do it on one two three. No. No, when you do make directories, you just put you wouldn't save it into Oh, I think it Saving it into one two three Yes, but once you, once you automatically. Yeah. How do you get into DOS? If you're in One Two Three of that suppose you wanted to make a directory. use it. How do you get into DOS? We have to go out I'd exit out Yeah. You could quit. Yeah. You could do, but then you have to restart One Two Three and re-retrieve your spreadsheet and all the rest of it. If you choose system from the top menu, that puts you into DOS, but it leaves One Two Three there. So you quickly get back so it's pointing at my one two three directory, so if I do M D yeah. if I do M D space put here, it will create a sub-directory, below the one two three directory, but if I want as a sub-directory from the roots directory, I have to type M D back-slash put. That would make it off the root directory. Erm. You can also point, well you start, you can point at the root directory, if you wanted to. Do you know how to do that? At the moment it's pointing at this one two three directory, back-slash P back-slash one two three Now you point at the root directory You directory You use You do C D sorry, I should have said M D If you want to make a directory off the root directory,you type M D to make directory. If you want to point at another directory, you do C D change directory, and that's pointing at the root directory there. Er so, when I want to create a directory called put off the root directory. I can do M D space put. I've got a directory here, now. You may want to put further sub-directories below that, maybe for different years, ninety three, ninety four ninety five. How do you how do you do that? back-slash one two Don't you do Do the and then the back-slash and then the Yes, you can do er, you can M D Put. Put M D I can do back-slash got a lot of space put here back-slash ninety three. Or you could you could point to that directory called put first of all. You do C D space put, so you're pointing at that directory, and then if you do M D ninety three, M D space ninety three, and then I've created a sub-directory in ninety three, below this directory. You do M D space ninety four, and create that one, and so on. And you can go further down under the ninety three and you may want to create further sub-directories. So, the put is like your filing cabinets. And these directories are like drawers in your filing cabinets and then you've got further sub-directories still, below that, then er, they're like folders, within your er, filing cabinet drawer. So you put your files in these different directories and then, when you're looking for something, er, you'll find it more easily. If you're looking for a budget file, for a particular year, and you know where to look. How do you erm, well, to get back into Lotus, type exit, and then enter Hang on right back to the spreadsheet. How do I erm, change it, so that when I do file retrieve, it lists directories in put ninety three. It lists files. If I do file retrieve it, it lists the files in put ninety three. That's the directory here. How do you do that? Well, you could type it all. what I do and then I could Sub-directories Er, yes, you could type er, back-slash back-slash put and then press enter, and it lists the sub-directories and you highlight that and press enter and then it would list where the files are in that directory, of course, I haven't got any, we've just created those directories. Erm, but then ev every time I wanted to retrieve a file from that directory, I'd have to type in that put and the ninety three and all the rest of it. How can I set it so that, soon as I do file retrieve, it lists the files from that directory? Worksheet file directory. Put the name of the directory. Erm Not files, yeah the Well, worksheet directory. You're almost right Worksheet directory. Erm. The file directory. Yeah. You do file Directory Directory Yeah Here. So the display'll change the current directories. The current directories, gotta be this one. If I wanted to point at the put directory. Put ninety three. I type that in, press enter. And then if I do file retrieve bring that up and it's listing files from that directory Yeah. straight away. Sorry? What I've done in the past, is erm, for file retrieve and then erm, on top of the original do a slash put and then enter, and that then gives me a sub-file. Basically, it lists the files on that directory, yes. You have to type put every time. Not like saying, if you do this file directory, type the put in, then er, you wouldn't have to type put in every time you retrieve the file, from the directory. Mm. Right. Let me just put the directory back to where it was. File directory right. Erm. So the advantage of pu putting your files in different directories, is you find things easily. One of the advantages. Probably some others as well here. As regards to various er other chores like deleting a set of files or copying a set of files, if you don't want the ninety three files any more you just delete all the files in the directory. You don't have to pick out the ones that are ninety three, cos th they're all ninety three in that particular directory. Er, another thing that's useful to do, is to name your files in a particular way. Have a convention for how you name your files. So the maximum length of the file name is, is what? Eight Eight characters, that's right. So you could use different characters of the file name to mean different things. Er, for example, the E A year as part of the file name, like eighty seven. Erm, you may well have got different directories, for the different years. It's not a good idea to include the year as part of the file name as well, because you might accidentally copy some files into the wrong directory. You might copy the ninety three file by accident into the ninety four directory. And if you've got the same file names, and you're doing a copy in DOS, you just overwrite them, and you overwrite the ninety four file with ninety three file there. But if each file has got a unique name, then that can't happen, so er, if you copy the all the files in that directory have got nine four as part of the file name, then if it's got nine three then, er, you won't be able to overwrite any files, you have two sets of files in there, and you can sort it out later on. Erm, in this particular spreadsheet system, there's a number of different files, for different departments. So I've got the department number. Just the two digit number in this example. There's the second and the third character of the file name. If it was a s single digit er, department, like department number six. I'd enter that as zero six. It always takes up the same number of positions in the file name, and that's useful as you shall see. Erm, I may have budget files, actual files, forecast files. There's a letter to indicate er, what that, er, is B for budget, A for actual, and F for forecasts. Er, the different types of files perhaps, there's a, maybe a payroll file, I have a P there, and I have a access file I have an A there. So, when you're looking for a file, you know you want, oh yes, it's for er department er thirty six er it's er payroll file, it's for nineteen ninety four and it's budget. Before you start looking for the file, you know what the file name is. So when yo you get a list of the file, you do a file retrieve, they're all listed in alphabetical order. You can, you alre can very quickly focus in on the one you're after, and you'd be sure that was the one, and you retrieve it and it's there. Very quickly. You don't have to retrieve any different files. Go searching through long lists of file names to find what you're after. So that's one advantage of having a naming convention. You find what you're looking for quickly. Erm, another advantage is erm, with various er chores, which is copying or deleting files. If I wanted to copy all of the department twenty two files to the, the A disk, the floppy disk. In DOS I could type copy space D twenty two star dot star to A. You familiar with these er the asterisks? What these mean? What does an asterisk mean? The whole file. The whole, whatever's on that erm. Would be all D twenty two. It would have to begin D twenty two, and anything that follows erm suppose you wanted to delete all the nineteen eighty seven files. What would you type in? In DOS. You type del, I'll give you that? Then what? Star dot, Eighty seven. Eighty seven. Eighty seven. Sorry. Wh what eighty-seven? Whatever it is, the department number, whatever. Well, it's all dif all different departments. Erm, eighty seven, then what? Dot star dot star Star dot star. you've delete your column eighty seven . Erm. Well, it says are you sure. What do you say? No. That's an honest answer. It's not what you normally do, is it? Er, most people, when they see a question like are you sure, they say, course I'm sure, yes. And er, that does delete all the nineteen eighty seven files, that's true. In fact, though, it deletes everything. It's the same as typing star dot star. Which you probably recognize as being everything. Says are you sure. Mm. Say yes, it deletes everything. So save yourself a bit of time like that. And, so that's not quite right It deletes star dot eighty seven. Star dot eighty seven. Now as soon as you put the dot, what you're saying is erm, that's the extension. These are the last three characters and then into the extension,the they're probably going to be W K one. Ta take the asterisk out. Er, in erm you need to use another wildcard. Do you know any other wildcards other than an asterisk? Question mark. Question mark. That's the one. Now what would you type then. Down One, two, three, four, four questions marks eighty seven. Four question marks eighty seven Question mark. Can do a question mark, I suppose. I suppose in the year I needn't do a star, a star if you wanted to. Er, so what that question mark means is what d what do you want to know? Can you tell me what your first er job was? In the quarry? What you were employed as? Oh er I I've only been erm I've only had one job. I mean er you know, I I was went in as a mechanical fitter and er stayed as such, getting sort of bigger and more responsibl bilities as I went Grew up. That's all and then I I I was looked after the production machinery for about fifteen years the top here. I was doing the the new developments as the years went by of course, we didn't stay still for long . Can you can you give me some idea of erm w what it was like to start in the quarry as an apprentice? W well erm you mean from the day one started sort of thing? Yes. Er well er one went up we we the fitting shop you see, was at . Erm the it was about I should imagine well guess, three years old back then. Cos two companies had amalgamated and built one fitting shop. . The works and the people had sort of amalgamated and so they used the one place where they had a fitting shop. Did away with one at in at this end, the new quarry. And er b built a bigger shop, a more modern one. Er of course one went, started work, very nervous, and er thought that everybody was sort of putting a tape measure and er Oh to tell you the t truth I I didn't know Well I knew there was one apprentice been there about twelve months or nearly twelve months . They were younger than myself and er we'd been at but er we'd been at together. We'd started at the same time. And er of course, one felt a little more a little happier after sort of meeting someone you know because it's quite and I was very shy at that at that time. And er of course everybody there were only about what half a dozen fitters in those days and erm er as a mark of their profession or trade in those days, they used to wear a white collar you know, with out a tie. And er they er well er what shall we say,w we we have got introduc people introduced themselves and asked who I was and who my family was and all that's the usual thing you know. Was that important? Was that considered important? Oh yes, they course the there was then er er relatives were then they sort of knew there were some who knew someone or cousin of whatever . I mean there were so many h Well really whole families working in the quarry in various parts of the quarry you see. And erm those erm Oh and then I was told which p put me off rather. Er by the man who or one of the men who swept the shop and kept it clean and all the the the one of the labourers, that my job was to one of my jobs was to make the tea for the men. So that put me off a bit. Was it true ? And I thought Oh yes, yes. And fetch water for them to wash and that. And erm so really three times a day I had to er make tea. Er of course it took a bit of time to learn as to er you know the the rotation who the to take the tea from various men's buckets, they was buckets, or wher wherever they had their stuff in their bags. And there weren't so many bags carried in those days as there were in later years, you know, the sort of er haversack thing. And er having to er knowing you know which and what time. I mean if er that w you you'd had it if if you w ruined for life if you er took one man's see but served two teas. er say er yeah within say er two days or worse still, you could it the same day actually, because they used to have those erm er Have you seen them, those an oval tin with two ends, er it was split in the middle. Have you seen them? Yeah. I've got one somewhere in the shed here. Because you could I mean you could do the empty one tin in a day really . And er tea and sugar. But th the thing was that there was a mess room outside the fitting shop actually, but there wasn't much room there because er men from other jobs, er they p from outside, used to go there and eat. So the our men er the fitters, had erm a table in the shop itself. Erm with in a corner sort of thing with a thing around it and you know. It was well I didn't see much sense in that either but er I mean if they were eating on the j er eating on the job didn't give you a break at all. But erm anyway, the erm and some of the men, used to go The older men, used to go and er to the smithy and cos er the our the s fitting shop had a three fires at one end you see, where the am blacksmiths were. Oh they weren't blacksmiths in in the ordinary sense of the word, they weren't quarry blacksmiths as such because they were more or less engine smiths you see. Yeah. They had to make and shape things for us well for for the fitters, the machine and that you know. They they were w what would be called in the navy and that er engine smiths. Cos they worked they didn't bash er ham sledge hammers and things like a shop and the gear for the quarry men as such, they Cos that was the usual work of the erm the blacksmiths outside in the quarry itself you know, in the b on the in the various banks. There was one, usually one blacksmith per bank really. W w w were these Were these smiths still primarily concerned with forging? Yes. Were they? They they they did the the forge work and all that you see, and they looked after erm the er the inclined brakes What we call the brake. I haven't I haven't seen heard another name for them really. Erm they looked after the w the ropes and er there was one one blacksmith, where he used to go on his rounds and check check the wire ropes and the hooks and that on the inclines you know. Test them for sa Well that the insurance and the I suppose er the the the erm er what is it? The mining er er you know the there's a a body which looks after the mining Oh the inspectorate? The inspectorate er men I don't know whether it's the same as the one that looked after the coal field and all that, but erm we we had an inspector coming round every so often anyway. And erm the the that was part part of their work you see,the these blacksmiths. And there were ooh a couple of what? A couple of dozen of these brakes or more. No at least a couple of dozen,working at that time. So they were kept really busy. Some of them were kept really busy just er looking after the brakes and and they they had to er check the er the erm hooks. They used to take the hooks off the wagon you see, there were two hooks, one each end of the the wagons that they used on the incline. And then they were put they were er put er in the fire wire brushed and all that and looked and inspected for cracks you see. And that that came round er I mean they were stamped and er the turn you know the each I I don't I don't remember what what they were examined, but er th you know the the that was the law that they had to be . There were piles of them in the smithy anyway. that had been through the fire and they were taken out and you know whoever. And h Well, no, they were put on the wagons actually. Which were built in the wagon shops. And erm Can you give me some idea of some of the other trades that were represented in the er in the shop? Oh erm they erm they did a lot of the work that were Well they helped out at least, they they used to make wearing plates for the mills and that for the chutes and that. You see. Erm oh they what else? Erm oh there were a thousand and one things I I can't really erm you know they they were always they were at it hammer and tongs you know they had er s what would be called something similar to a steam hammer and you know. Did they? To do the job, yeah. Er you know the the they had a f what was it? Four hundred weight, pneumatic hammer. So you can imagine the the the the he the amount of heavy work that they had as well. Did they ever have a foundry? Did they have a No er well, No er not not that I remember. But erm I remember er h having I was quite interested actually, er there was er a sort of loft in the stores. And there were patterns up in this store you see. Mm. And I but I couldn't get up at them, the the storekeeper was fairly strict with us youngsters and he used to chase us. But erm they were oh m er wooden er gear wheels, of all sizes and such things, you know. Up in this loft say. So I don't know whether they'd been sending them away, to be er as patterns to some other firm or what, but there was quite a quant there was er a quantity of of casting sand you know black stuff that you use. Around the the the shop so, obviously they'd been either been casting brass, at some time or other. Obviously . They didn't do I I understand that the the quarries at and and those places used to cast their own stuff, but erm I I haven't I never heard of them actually casting anything erm ferrous anyway. But erm the what we o very often did was er we used to run our own own bearings with white metal. And we had er a special erm furnace for that. And er we used to run Well most of our bearings, actually er white metal bearings and machine them afterwards. And er we cast during the dark days of the war,when toys weren't available, we a few older blokes er apprentices used to I remember being at it for a couple of hard week we had a hard week, well evening during the evenings anyway. Er working, sweating like like er real steel men,ca turning out soldiers and er and erm e somebody'd got hold of a mould of these er er toy soldiers you know, the old er lead soldiers that er Yeah. They used to come out in threes I think moulds. And some aero aero aeroplane erm g er er what er I think they were If I remember rightly, they were the er Oh dear. Forget the name of the plane now for the moment. Yes well. There were hundred of them flying round the end of the during the war. Oh, designed for the coastguard. Er coastal command. Oh dear, never mind. But we you know, one was one would be boiling the the white metal, we'd we'd fixed on the and er one would be boiling and pouring the stuff and the other cutting y you know breaking up the the mould sort of thing and piling the stuff out and as fast as we were piling them up, some beggar was creeping in and stealing them . Oh dear. You know, in actual fact, one of the men working in the in the in the carpenter's shop. He was he'd been hurt that was the usu that's why some of the men did. He'd been er had an accident in the quarry some time ago and he was working in the helping as a mate or something in the carpenter's shop and he he must have been h must have had his hands in our pile of finished products and er Well partly finished products and er he er he was caught one of the cos er these castings there was a an edge to them you know,the joint of the the mould that came together sort of thing. They had to be filed clean. This beggar had come in to the fitting shop,corner at the back corner, where he shouldn't have been. I mean he wasn't supposed to be in the fitting shop anyways. So the the manager our greatest enemy, we used to know when he started from the house in the morning actually by quarry that er he was coming, but the on this particular day anyway, somebody had slipped up somewhere. And he saw this bloke you see, where he shouldn't have been. Er filing away. And he had this this erm casting of a plane you know he was cleaning up the edges gave the game away of course then . Oh dear. Anyway we I think we supplied dozens of youngs kids that had no toys during the war. you know. . Erm yes well th that's the only erm casting you know, that we did. bearings for for you know, shafts mills really the old type crushers in mills that They were really old fashioned crushers. And they had to be the bearings had to be either you had to have a s a set ready at all times sort of thing you know so a spare set. Erm yeah oh the bearings we we they usually were bought from They were American er brass bearings, huge brass things you know. They used to cost about two hundred pounds in those days and that was a heck of a sum in those days you know that sort of thing, how much they cost and had to be careful of them and all that. And erm the other crusher, the Buchanan crusher up in in here, the the the primary crusher, the American one. Well that that used to be sent away the o the main bearing the main er jaw bearing that was on the . It was usually about six Was it? Er somewhere about Aye getting on for five five foot long. Erm th that was sent away to London white metal that that that was quite a costly affair as well. That's the one that you see in this er book you know.. Is that the one which was having the ? Yes cuts in it. Yes yes. Yes. And erm the old chief that designed er er erm a boring bath for it for boring that. They they didn't they they just cast them roughly. Well not roughly I mean they I mean they didn't sort of finish them off w wherever they was s sent to in whatever the firm I I I don't know the name of the firm, I was I wasn't involved in didn't bother as long as the job was done. And erm the He made a boring bath so that the whole block it it was a massive thing you know, that that that had to be . I should imagine weighed somewhere about five six hundredweight. the capping. Cos of the design of this crusher affair, the whole weight was carried on the c what could be the bap of the bearing you know, the bearing cap. the whole lot down you see. Oh I see. On the on the You There was only the was only er three quarter of an inch out of centre sort of thing you know, but the shaft weighed ten tonne and you have this huge and it just l revolved of course and and the whole lot revolved under this cap. So the whole weight of the whole er the gear that actually sent the crusher going and made it so the jaws the swing jaw swing and all that, was er hanging on the cap you see. It didn't matter, the other half didn't matter because it didn't come into contact really with the with the shaft. And erm the Oh he'd made I'm getting er losing my track. But er he'd made er a boring bath from the chassis of a steam engine. There was a spare one lying around We'd finished u er stopped using them during the war some time during the war. Cos coal was hard to get and all that. And er gone on to diesel. And this old chassis had been built up so that this bearing lay on that and it was turned by and electric motor and all that and the boring bar went tool went and bored this bearing out and travelled along on its own its own It was fed off course. you know it was a quite a a brilliant idea really . Cos he was a brilliant man actually my my boss er my chief at the time. He was the erm he came from Anglesey. And he'd been apprenticed in Liverpool with a firm called they were ship repairers in Liverpool. And er I suppose he he'd gone there when he was about thirteen fourteen and er he came from a family from Where was it . And some of his rel relatives they farmed but some of his relatives were blacksmiths as well you see. So he'd sort of had a well I suppose he'd messed around helped and played about in the smithy. Before he even started erm when he before he went to Liverpool as an apprentice. But he was a brilliant man he was years ahead of his time really. Erm Ingersoll Rand w wanted him in America. He was offered a job in America with Ingersoll Rand but he wouldn't go. And erm he was by the way he was the er step erm father in law of the man who erm owned who was the erm building firm er in er er Oh dear they've gone now. It's just been taken over by you know, it's gone into the big big time er Oh dear me, I forget his name now. name of the man. G Anyway Oh er and er er he had a son who was a a dentist in . John quite a well known dent he was a very good dentist. I suppose he he erm William, William Owen old chief. He used to bring his tools up during the war to er to er so be seen to you know. Cos they they were hard to get . . Oh yes . And er one of the men that was helping the old man to to do something, to repair the the these tools you know, and he he'd gone to the stores to get something and leaning over the counter to get something er er to sort of talk as one goes on a on a counter lean he was leaning a on the counter, and he erm the the the storeman he was a tough little beggar, and he said, I've got a I've got a I've got a toothache. he says. And asked him you know, Erm which one is it? And the other silly beggar opened his mouth and pointed to a tooth you know. And he just dived in there and and got hold of it these tools er once you get a hold of those things you know they they're pretty They're fantastic you they won't. I mean them they're designed to er so that they don't slip or anything. And he held on the handle and he pulled the ruddy tooth out. But he pulled thing was sorry thing was that he pulled the one next to the one that he had a toothache in . Wow . was tough, he's still alive in . Er couldn't have done him any harm. And er No but erm that's how the the old chief . Erm as I say he was a he was brilliant man er I mean we all we I'm about one of the last of the ones that were taught under him. I mean we were very fortunate in having been app er apprenticed under him you see. Were you were you aware, before you went there, that erm you were going into You were going to serve under someone who was rather talented? Well I'd heard of him yes. But I was er here I was one of the first People have forgotten that there was such a thing as a fitting shop in you know, in . And I started a fashion really in going, cos no-one had er thought of the thing for many many many years. And erm later on let's see f when the war started and I mean they wanted cheap labour and all that, there was room for apprentice. Several boys went to the fi to the fitting shop you see but the I'd started I claimed to have started I mean it's I mean there's no credit to me but at least I was the first You know I'd really started the thing you know. Where had they come from before then? Oh usually. Yes. Yes. Yes. They knew more about it yes. was the Well I suppose they had first claim in . that sort of thing yeah. But they came with the chief being an Anglesey man you see, they came from Anglesey as well to erm they used to come a lot in and erm as apprentices you know And er Aye no, the ol same old game again that er we in Wales seem to inherit it's in I suppose it's in the B B C and everywhere isn't it. It's not what you know, it's who you know. And er somebody's got a relative somewhere . I mean happened even even with the monarchy and all that most Welsh people ran ran England when they didn't have it really did they . These families that left Wales to help out with the Tudor and all that. Erm I still er think I think they're still running Britain aren't they. gone way out I've gone gone through to get to to Llandudno. Erm th this tea making was a a er job of course there was a a break at nine o'clock you see. Cos we started at at half past seven. I used to catch a bus ten to seven, down when the in those days. Never been late in my life. Erm the erm Course the the blasting was on at nine. They used to blast, first blasting at nine o'clock, throughout the quarry you see so everybody had to go in so that was an excuse for a break. About ten minutes break. Then cos you had er three warnings you got five minutes before and er then you had a the erm final warning and then the blasting and the they give you the all clear. I mean it took about ten minutes, quarter of an hour altogether. So if these beggars up at the top it was had been er thought out had a break well er it was alri =right for the others working down in the bottom to have a a break. So nine o'clock break. make the tea, go round the Used to take about three helpings of tea to make the the the bottle . I remember we I had this sort of enamel brown enamel jug, ooh it was mm must have been somewhere about four. Mm couple of pints at least eh. Oh more three pints I'm sure. Er and erm I used to put it in this and go to out into the mess room outside where they there was a cook and it was a very grand name for a person you know, a cook. It's almost as grand as a chef these days isn't it. The bloke who sits behind the ship in the chip shop. Banging that basket he had they have,Erm and er the er used to go there er and there was a boil or was it er er an old fashioned I don't know. Have you se have you seen them the old fashioned boilers they used to have? Er sort of Yes, half spherical, Yes. cast iron. Built er with bricks built round it and er a tap we used to have a tap on it you see. And the cook in that mess room and the cook was always a youngster who started in the quarry. That's the way you started, up a ladder to the to be a managing director . A cook. You know like like the this thing about every soldier having a a a field marshall's baton in his knapsack . anyway erm they started at Well you know quite an easy job but the the er s their wage was about sev I I I I forget. I d I wouldn't know. I think my my starting salary at fifteen was seven and six. Out of that I had to find, threepence a day erm bus fare. Excuse me. And we worked six w six I mean we worked Saturday mornings you know, six o'clock. Plus er going up going to you know, all that. Sos there wasn't much left of the seven and six to kee feed me and all that . And er I think after and when I became sixteen that er had to start paying your your m paying the union I had to join the union as a junior member you know. And er hospital fund and all this business. Anyway erm so you . our standard of living Well our standard of living was alright. I mean er didn't bring much home. And er the cook I think the boys e had about er started on ten shillings you know, ten shillings a week. Erm but er that was this boy's job and then he used to er you know, scrub the tables in the rest room and of course boil the water first thing in the morning. And er wash the cups and And he used to have to go running er down with messages down to or down to the head office rather that we had an office in where where our fitting shop was where there was a draughtsman's office. And a store, a store a sort of store clerk. Cos we had other people concerned with the stores down in the head office as well, the buyers and . And a couple of young clerks, that's where they bred their clerks for the future use sort of thing you know. I see. And this cook had to go down and carry messages back and forth and all that was his job as cook. Not he he couldn't handle a a roast duck or er couldn't roast a duck or anything like that you know. Or make orange sauce or er anything of that sort . Er and I don't think any other most of them started and they're still here some of them. Er still roast a duck any more than I can. Well er not without a a book of instructions anyhow beside me anyway. Er anyway the that was the cook's job and that was my job, I used to sort of go across and fetch this tea and have it ready by the time the men gave up work at nine o'clock. But er I used to go I didn't eat with the men you weren't allowed to eat with the men you see, it was only the full men that sat round this table well That was Half about eight of them you see. Well it was the same no distinction at all in that sense, but er you know we were sort of they had more serious things to talk about than I wan er you know I knew the cook, er couple of o other apprentices from the carpenters shop we used to go into the main th there was no-one to keep an eye on us in the in the mess-room you see, no-one to tell us. So we could play. And erm at the same time there was an old mill there as well, with an old er engine room. Which had apparently been a a steam There had been a steam engine turning this er mill crushing mill and er er I remember there was a name in in this engine it was Queen of the Valley. And erm we used to go and play in that sort of you know do the things that boys usually do. Sort of Oh we used to risk our necks walking across the ruddy this mill was a bit of a wreck actually and we used to go playing in places where we shouldn't have really. Anyway, that's beside the point. But erm and then at during er before lunch and all that I used to have to go take a bucket and go to the smithy and erm as you may know, there's a a cooling er tank beside in the in er beside every every every erm blacksmith's fire and er you know to bo keep the er no t no to keep the nozzle of the Of the blower? blower going you see. Oh. How do you do? How do you do? Hi. And this co er and used to get w hot water from this tank you see, lift it out with a ooh with some sort with a ladle actually. Er and er put it in the bucket and get the right temperature. Up my elbow and er anyway put it used to take it back to the shop and er well I was still inside the shop, down to a certain place in the shop and put it on a on a stand and then there'd be a on that stand, beside the bucket, was a a box of not Lux not Lux soap but er yellow soap. Oh yes. in Welsh. And erm slabs of it it had been cut like er it looked you know if you sort of cut lard or something like that. No you don't belong to that age either do you. Erm you know you get it in packets now anyway. But er you know used to sli cut it out of er big chunks. But er there's be lump of this y yellow er stuff you know. And beside that again, another box full of erm well partly full depended on what time of the week it was. Erm dust quarry dust and er very very fine chippings you know. So you got a handful of this yellow soap. And er rubbed it and it was quite very hard you know. And er put a dollop er dipped your hand into this the grit as well started rubbing using the water we'd got. Some hot water. And see my hands they they they're quite they're they're exactly like a er well shall we say an educated person's hand A person who's spent his life working behind a desk. But you know it's funny how why it was so I mean the grit and those were quite sharp you know You you'd have thought that it would have taken your skin but then it was ideal stuff for getting the grease the you know the dirt and I mean the the greasy dirt away. It's easy enough to dirt . That was the method that we used and I didn't I never heard I didn't hear of dermatitis or anything until well twenty five years afterwards. Erm I mean the one could very easily have have got er some form of dermatitis with all the you know various oils and stuff that we had to put our hands in. But erm and all the old mill for milling that we used to used I mean kept our hands clean anyway. So that was one job a and then we had a big used to beg for a an old sack from the stores and open that out and er I used to wash them wash it and get it very soft and clean and hang that up and that's the way used to clean and keep ourselves cl hands clean . And er but for all this, erm funny enough we we had er a fair in twice a year. we haven't had one for oh many what fifteen, twenty years a co er there used to be a couple of women used to come to sell rock. Up to about twen they kept the thing going their pitch going I suppose twen to about twenty years ago. But we had a a spring fair in April and the other in October. I think so. And the fair was on the first of October. somewhere round that time. I I'd er you know the older men would tell you. Cos I I didn't sort of go by fairs and things like that, I belonged to a different generation. Erm but erm come the time had come for for the fair let's say the the the Spring fair. I'd get quite a surprise because very s small number of men in the shop. I get about shillings eight and six, nine bob pocket money. Fair money they used to call it you see. Mhm. Er I know er perhaps I was er civil or obedient or whatever, I don't know but er I I they u they used to have this this collection for the for supposedly for carrying the water, I don't know. But erm er it was a a nice sum to be to take with you to the fair . You know. Er because it was more than a weeks wages . To spend evening. And used to happen twice a year and erm sometimes somebody'd remember my birthday or find that I had my birthday or and at Christmas time we used to get some money. And this was out of a you know er I mean they were only what Oh couldn't be more than about six eight people working in the Well not actually fitters but er you know, they were involved within the shop sort of thing. I don't know how many t other people were approached in this collection, I don't know. But erm they were you know they were exceedingly kind really. Yeah they were very kind too. Cos their salary we we well their wages weren't much. They I believe that er a craftsman's wage was somewhere they'd a take home pay at the end of the fortnight. You'll notice that I say end of the fortnight, that was the settling time . Er was three guineas. Was it? It was one and three an hour. the craftsman and fitter's rate in those days. And a labourer's rate was eleven pence an hour. Mm. Wh what erm what ye what year would this be that you sort of s I don't k nineteen thirty seven maybe? Thirty seven? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. And erm you know it was a a bad time really b you know it was the thirties I mean people say it's bad now but er I don't think it's it's as bad now as it was then. I know the unemployment figures may be higher and all this business, but erm I few years. Well he's not going to be there for ever. Decisions are made decisions are made erm there that we and we have to live with the consequences of them. If they affect education then it's our responsibility to speak up about them. You see I I think er er probably one of the best erm Ministers of er of er Education that er has been for quite some considerable time and I bet you throw your hands up in horror when I say this you will totally disagree and I'm talking here cos his name's just slipped out of my mind . Who was tha who was that oh for goodness sake tall thin gaunt looking man, always had to have about fifteen spoonfuls of sugar in his coffee whenever I met him? S Sir Keith Joseph? Er you knew you see Sir Keith Joseph. Now I I remember talking to him for hours once on a programme about education and this was when he first said what we want is teachers to be accountable. And I'm a great believer in everybody should be accountable right? Yes. We well I've no objections to that to that at all. No none of you do now but when he first suggested it everyone was up in arms and he poor old soul I remembered he said, I've had enough change I I believe in this I I've I've tried I'm too old now and out he walked. Is there a chocolate machine in the building? And off he went. He was addicted to chocolate. I I I think erm a lot of teachers would now look back on those days with er a certain fondness now bearing in mind what's what's happened since and the the the succession of education secretaries we've had since since then I mean had the only one in recent years who I would say has attempted a genuine dialogue with the teachers and tried to do something constructive is John McGregor. So when, and I would agree with you again, so when are the teachers going to be accountable, when is somebody who is a bad teacher and heck there are quite a few of them, you know it only takes a couple in every school to make it difficult for the rest, going to be got rid of you know you are not up to the mark out. There there are systems in place in schools already for that and there always have been. You jest with me now come on we're we're we're being serious Noel if you are a teacher it is almost impossible to sack you. Almost totally impossible. That's simply not true. There there are disciplinary procedures in in all schools erm which are there to be used. Why are they never used then? Are all teachers too good to be sacked because it is it is as rare as erm teeth in chickens. I think it's I think it's very easy to er to ex exaggerate the problem to take one anecdotal evidence of of one about one or two cases and maybe about one or two people and say this is a major problem in every school. Let me put it this way to you Noel I don't think it is. Let me put it to you this way you know as well as I do people who really ought to be doing something else other than teaching. You know that as well as I do and those people don't seem to be given the encouragement to move on to another profession. I I Some are some are promoted to head teachers I know and I knew you were going to say that. I wasn't going to say that no . Erm no I I honestly don't think that er that the the problem is as big as as big as you you say it is and I I think the the structures are there to deal with that and if if people had you know if people used them then they would they would work and they from time to time that they are used and you know it it is not impossible to get rid of rid of a teacher in in the way you are suggesting. Okay Noel thank you for your er your time and being a good sport this afternoon and I hear you have a little one you had better go back and sort things out. That's right. Okay. Okay thanks. Thanks a lot Noel bye bye. Noel from the er N U T. Erm I don't know what this is serious point actually if if you fancy yourself as one of these so called mums and I think it is a little patronizing the er title of a mums' army of teachers, if you think that maybe you could do that and you'd be interested in doing that and you think it's quite a good idea I'd be interested in hearing from you, all right? O nine O four serious talk O nine O four six four one six four one erm if you'd like to do that give me a call. Now where is er where is Rita where are you Rit all right my love all right where's Rita I've got I've got yellow I've got red I've got blue I've got green. What number is Rita on give me a number because I haven't got white? Twenty four Okay right if I put that down there Rita hi. Hi. How are you? I'm fine thanks . Hang on let me do that again that's good that isn't it? Makes a little noise click click click click. Can I have a chip does anybody hi Rita Hi. Lovely Rita meter Oh don't please. I hate that isn't it awful to be obvious. Well that's what everybody sings to me when them and they meet me for the first time or get introduced to me. Oh they don't. Where are you calling from we're very loud with callers today I know I'm not the most exciting thing on radio but you know there must be some callers out there somewhere? Where am I. I'm at a little place called Ellenthorpe. Ellenthorpe. Is the weather as bad as people keep telling me because it was Okay when I drove in this morning. No it's not it's it's quite mild, there's no frost on the ground it's all gone. So what's this about snow at Thirsk? Well they can keep it we don't want it. Bit strange in Thirsk anyway I thought. I think there'd probably somebody with expanded polystyrene ceiling that's been pulled out. Probably. Yeah it's it's actually it's not too bad it's a bit misty it's a bid hazy erm slight wind but it's not bad. It's not? No it's not bad No Okay. I've just got to get something do you mind? No go and get your chips or whatever. No I've got I've got I wanted t It's all right my hubby can wait for his lunch I aren't bothered. Jolly well ought to as well. Er I wanted to talk to Jim Bowen you see about this quiz show host ought to be a a little nicer than they are and apparently his answer machine is on at home. Well I must admit James I've threatened to put mine on. Have you? Well Karen said that if I won the competition she'd ring back. Mm and then you thought, Oh God I've done it now . But I had to speak to you you see and I dialled you while you actually said on the air that anyone that won had to speak to you and said to Karen look if you ring back I'll put the answer phone on . I know I thought that was good because then everybody puts the phone down you see and they all think they're going to be terribly clever. Yes I think it depends on what kind of a message you actually have on your recorder to start off with. Is your's rude. No it just says that it's basically to the effect of that the answering machine is quite reliable I I and if you leave a message it will be dealt with and people do leave a message, whereas before when it just said I'm sorry I'm not available they didn't they just put the phone down. I usually leave a message saying I'm having sex at the moment ring back in about three seconds. And do they? Sometimes sometimes they never ring back at all ever. I should've just say you're bragging. Yes you're right, you been speaking to my wife? Well yeah we'll probably use the same supermarket I don't know.

Why don't you wonder over here and bring a bottle of wine and we'll share it over the next hour of the show. Oh I can't I've got things to do in the office, a busy company here. I never did like those open topped buses. Well unclear So I'll be back to you. at the moment I can see about half well a dozen people sat on one of the buses. Can you? Yes. No wonder there's no traffic moving out there today. There is traffic moving, it's moving quite freely apart from the cars going into the car park just behind Clifford's Tower. Is that right? That's right yeah. There's never any spaces behind Clifford's Tower so I don't know how you're just telling me fibs aren't you? Well they're all they're all queuing up to go in there so I not sure. I just don't understand all these buses with the open tops it's freezing out there and all these tourists look they could walk Rachael. Well are tourists They could walk, why don't they walk? It's a seven kilometre tour. It takes an hour and a lot of people don't want to walk around the city they'd like the option of going around on the bus. What did the Minister of Health say the other day? Obesity obesity and lack of exercise. and that's what you're encouraging Rachael . Not encouraging lack of exercise we're encouraging an informative tour around the city with a qualified guide. You still got that beautiful blonde hair? We're not on the air are we? No no no we're not on the air. Heaven forbid I wouldn't talk to you like this if we were on the air would I ? Anyway so go on. Right. What were we talking about? So you don't mind Talking about the buses. Yeah. So I mean I think it'd great Guide Friday you run around little flag in the air, I've seen them in London and you can do that and and and people get so fit. Not that you need to be any fitter than you are. Well they are fit cos they get on and off at any of the stops they go along to the attraction that they want to do. Yeah I walk from my front door to my car as well and people say that's not enough exercise. Well the a there's the Barbican Centre for the exercise perhaps they should encourage the tourists there then. Mm Forgetting all about oh dear I've got a frog when I go on the air I'll clear that. Er can you hang on a minute? Yes certainly. I just got a we commercial breaks call you back in a minute don't go away yet. Rita? Rita? Oi Rita where's Rita gone. You cut her off well get her back on.

You were very pleasant. And didn't say you know, It's flipping these tour buses in York that cos all the other people trouble because you can't get anywhere they clog the roads up. Well that's really not our problem I mean that's to do with the deregularization of er bus companies allowing any anybody to start up a bus company. Oh that's a bit political Rachael isn't it a bit political I wasn't expecting that featured the last er three years some of the other companies have only been here since last year and the year before so I mean we're a national tour operator experienced in running open topped tours around cities.

Well, when I say abroad, I mean from the E C as well. Erm, you can look after your own factories in this country, and you source ingredients, but you won't be able to do that for anything coming ov coming overseas. And the major manufacturers erm, there is a major trade in ingredients, between the multi-nationals as they pass things across. So the theory might not well work out in prac practice. But I honestly can't come up with any solution in that respect, because er, until you've got er multi-national enforcement agencies which no politician is going to agree to, erm, you're not going to solve the pro pro problem there. And if they think that it suits them to shift a factory to the Philippines because there won't be an inspection there, that's what they'll do. Can you note this Mr Chairman? That's depressing isn't it really? Very, but there you go. That's life, but we do what we can. And it's a statutory obligation in this country and that's really what you know. Because we can't just accept that, that manufacturers will look after it for us, because as you've, already said by the Chief, they'll move the factory where it I mean, you can even get a situation Chairman, where you'll get some of the big multiples will tell a, will agree specifications with a food manufacturer, but they're not going to be able to check on the ingredients, so even though the, the, the Sainsburys and the Marks and Spencers of this world say we don't want any er,gen genetically modified ingredients going into anything that we're going to buy, there's no way that they can guarantee that before we've even bought any. Having said that, do we accept the recommendations in this report? Yes Authorizations for legal proceeding. Proposed. Agreed. Registration of births deaths and marriages. It's for you Mr Nothing to add, er, if members have any questions I'll be happy to answer them. Noted? Charity Youth Committee, marked S. Do we have a member er, from that Committee? Yes Chairman, I am following in Major 's shoes, I don't reckon I know a great deal about it yet, and I'm not sure that this erm, er, advisory er, committee is yet actually on the go, but I will go into this. The stumbling block here does seem to be the inability of the Charity Commissioners themselves to keep up with the volume of work. Er, I am, Mr Chairman, I support that fully, because if you write to them it's six months before they'll reply. And you're wondering, I mean I don't think we can expect of the advice of charities now, or very little, you know, and, and they've got to be very, very careful I was meeting the Commissioners Pardon? I was leaving the Commissioners out as far as I could. Yes, yes, yes. It's a very meagre budget Chairman I should think we're getting off very lightly. Yes . Item nine, motion evenings and Saturday meetings. I propose that we retain the status quo Chairman. I'll second that I second that Are you all in favour of that? Yes West Mercia Police Authority, Paper C, now you received this late I'd be pleased to answer questions Chairman, and I'm sure Mr will help, help me deal with the budget crisis. And I shall endeavour to Well that's all you've got in front of you at the moment, isn't it, the budget Chairman? You have other things as well. Are there any questions? Pardon? Are there any questions, I'm asking, yes, I'm waiting for questions. Can I make an observation Mr Chairman, will you take observations as well? Yes, I'll take observat why, wait a minute. Yes, erm, on paragraph three erm, the, the last sentence erm, where it says without direct access to its own balances, the authority may therefore have to make revised precept in ninety four, ninety five erm, I understand what's being said there, but any organization needs to actually work within er, a clearly defined budget. Er, the Police Authority last year I think actually had to have an extra nine hundred thousand pounds of spending, the budget was funded by the constituent's authorities, erm, and we've already for next year in fact, made available effectively six hundred thousand pounds worth of extra spending by erm, various means, so I would hope that erm, the authority does use as, as much prudence and restraint in its financial affairs as possible, because of the, the effects on all, all concerned. Yes, Chairman, can I say that erm, when the b the budget's in the process of formulation and we're discussing the question of balances and reserves and how they should be marked for the immediate future, particularly in regard to the way that er, reorganization may take place at police authorities in the very near future, and also those of us who are on this, on, on other committees who've had experience in, and the same sort of thing happening in further education for instance, where immediately the assets, before even the regulations were put on the table, the assets of all these things were, all these er, erm,coll the further education colleges were frozen so we couldn't do anything with them at all as an Authority, and er, actually many of them were taken from us without er, without any question at all . So in the light of that it's per now is a good opportunity to er, make sure that those reserves and balances were available for A, the er, Police Authority should it require it, but B, to those constituent authorities who had helped in the er, build-up of these reserves. Now, what's being said here in that particular sentence, is that there are obviously going to be, or possibly could be occasions when er, the Police Authority has er, an overspend, which is an immediate problem for instance, on pensions, and you've heard the er, Fire Service Chief talking about his problems. They're just the same with the police force, there could be er, er, an increase in police pay,or there could be any, a very large incident which would require planning, if these happen then it has always been the case, if there wasn't the money available then a precept could be put upon us as a local authorities to er, cover that erm, directly. That's no different to what the situation is now, it was there before, the difference is that the banker is different. The banker is not the reserves of the Police Authority, because that has now been transferred to the authority. I should tell you that er, the budget really represents er, an increase in the availability of police resources over the previous years. I'm delighted with that, the budget came out er, much better than I'd hoped it would do, and er, and I, I am sure that we shall see some improvement in the police er, over the next year. Of course there is, there is the possibility, there is definitely going to be a reorganization, we shan't have the same sort of input I don't think, we shan't be allowed to have the same sort of input in a totally undemocratic er, er, authority that's going to be there where the, the governments will er, put er, most of the people on board, where the Home Secretary will decide on the Chairman, er, we don't know what the government regulations are going to say about balances in terms for the new authority. Er, if they say that er, they should be er, a balance or reserve put in by constituent authorities then we will have the money available to do that, if we didn't then they may have frozen the reserves that are already there and asked us to put some more money in as well. I find that is the situation that I've tried to er, guard against with the budget that we've been put in on this occasion, and I hope that answers er, er, Mr but er, I'll answer any other questions that are put up. Thank you very much. Could I say Chairman,in Worcester and Shropshire are in agreement with this budget and er, which has been engineered to a great deal by the Chairman of the Budget and er, we're here to, Yes I don't, I don't mind worked out, but engineered gives a very Regarding paragraph nine Chairman, no doubt you, you would tell us if there's been a response on this, because this does seem a useless step forward er, to increase the number of people at the coalface as it were, and self-financing, and no doubt we shall hear in due course about this. The Authority are pushing as much as they can on the scheme and there's been no response to yesterday. It's a crazy situation, because when Clarke was the Home Secretary, and he made a, a speech in parliament, we adjourned a meeting of the Authority to listen to him speaking, now we'd already made applications er, to increase the number complete officers by the, getting rid of the superintendents, and Clarke came out with what we'd said, yes, do that, but the Home Office are still saying no you can't. Er, I mean the whole lot separately, Yes, yes, I mean it's crazy. if I can comment on that Chairman, the erm, the Authority asked for thirty for next month, along with all the other authorities I think in the country, asked for an improvement in the, in the policing the country, and I think people that live in, in Shropshire, and the people that live in other er, parts of the country as well, would have welcomed the increase in the police force this year, but the government decided not to do that. We, we then had this situation where the, er, the Chief Constable ha went to great lengths to er, work out a new establishment for himself, and the senior management, and actually ach chi and er, and preempted it and then asked the er, the Home Office if he could use the money to increase the constables on the beat. We are still waiting for them to agree or not to that. The feeling at the moment is that they are sympathetic towards us, and they don't see any difficulty in that as yet, but no one is prepared to put their hand up and say yes go ahead and spend the money in that way. But the money is in the budget Chairman, I want to make that quite clear, the money is here in, in the West Mercia Police budget to be able to provide sixteen extra policemen immediately. Police Officers. Policemen immediately that that is given to us by the Home Office. I hope the Authority unanimously do support it. Yes, I think Chairman, you ought to ask your Committee to note paragraph six, I think that's quite important and worthy of note. Because we employ a lot of Can I record we've received this here Mr Chairman? Move the reports received? Yes. Now it is recommended that we in section nine and four A, in brackets four, someone move. Chairman, can he just report to us? Right, Chairman, if we can just go through this briefly. Erm, number thirty six. Erm, it contains access to four, five and they'll be submitted after discussion at this particular Committee, to Policy Planning or the Policy Resources Committee. As we've made perfectly clear in the last discussion we've just had, no final decisions on the implementation of any variations will be taken until Council meets on the twenty fifth of February. This booklet was distributed just before met, so in fact er, paragraph two does say at the moment that in our new recommended programme there isn't, well in fact they did agree those recommendations. In addition though, and we come on to them in a second, it asks for further reductions to be added to that if possible. But the provisional guid the guideline which was set by Policy and Resources in the first instance, was just for this Committee to identify seventy thousand pounds' worth of reductions. Those reductions were those identified in paragraph three and perhaps I do need to point out in fact that according to the report in Policy and Resources Committee, the use of carry forwards from the registration service of twenty thousand pounds in fact needs to be replicated across all three years. Now quite clearly that has er, implications on the registration service and believe the County Secretary will talk about that at some future point. Erm, paragraph four erm, outlines there is a gap after these new guidelines of six hundred and seventy one thousand, and to bridge that gap, the P and R asked that er, the Fire and Rescue Service identify a hundred thousand pounds of sur of reductions from its budget. The audition which is the additional item includes moves at Policy and Resources Committee that they asked all committees to expose further reductions if possible to help close this gap of six hundred and seventy one thousand pounds. Just find it on the kind of introduction. The other guideline which was issued was namely that of capital, where the a accepted the general guidelines which appeared in the county papers and as far as this Committee was concerned, would mean the general acceptance of all those items which appear in that the first year of that capital programme, subject to the proviso that the revenue contemplated and the benefits of the capital programme will be considered by Policy Panel in its forthcoming meeting. As far as the introduction is concerned I have nothing more to say. I am, unless there are any questions, can we not then five, move on to number five? Er, one question if I may Chair? Erm, I note that on paper R earlier, we er, approved the recommendation to ask Resources Management sub-committee to approve the release of three thousand of registration service carry forward monies, and we're now being asked to approve our budget next year, which er, also reduces twenty thousand for registration service. Can we be told please exactly what the er, balancing hand of carry forwards shown on the right estimates, the twenty three thousand consists of? Are they, what, what are those are registration services? That, the thirty three thousand includes twenty three thousand of the registration services carry forwards, but it does not take into account the three thousand which have just been requested here. So that would reduce it down to twenty. I just want to make sure we have the money now. If you, if you like, I could speak now Chair? Yes Er, naturally we're disappointed you're proposing to take er, twenty thousand of our twenty three thousand carry forwards in the registration service. The problem is as Mr has said, if that is expected to be replicated across future years, this would represent a ten percent reduction in the statutory service, er, which is only partly under control of this Committee, with mixed responsibilities with the Registrar General. Seventy percent of the expenditure is on staff who you do not employ and cannot dismiss, a large part of the income, or all the income is through the fees that are set na nationally by the government. You have very little room for manoeuvre within this service, and the Registrar General has reserve powers to impose services on you, and I would have to advice you it would be virtually, or I would have to say it would be impossible to achieve that ongoing reduction in future years. Erm, does the Chair wish er, me to reach section by section, or do you wish to take the bookings as they are Chairman? Well I think we've got to take it section by section. In that case the, the white page which isn't numbered at the back of page three, is the revised estimate, and shows the variations as outlined there. Erm, the only variations which are actually going outside the Committee control are as a result of the internal market variations which are going on down . Plus of course the growth in the Firemen's Pension Scheme of thirty one thousand in the current financial year, rising in future years. Otherwise the Committee services are containing their budgets within original cash limits. If there are no questions on the revised estimates Chair, then the, the base budget for ninety three, ninety four are those outlined on the green pages, identified it certain service by service. It's on these figures which in effect any Committee reductions will be made. I have nothing further to say on the green pages. Do members have any questions? Okay, does anybody Before, before you go on, you say that the twenty thousand can't be rep replicated in income registration column, does that show, how would show in here then? It doesn't show, it doesn't show in here, no. If the registration service was erm, asked to ma to reduce its budgets for ninety four, five and future years, by twenty thousand, it could do it in to three, four, five because it would bring forward twenty thousand pounds worth of carry forwards. However in five, six, its net expenditure would reduce to erm, two hundred and twelve thousand pounds. And from what County Secretary's just said, we would be unable to identify reductions in statutory service to live within that cash and The salmon pages then Chair, are those items which have been put forward to achieve the guidelines set by Policy and Resources Committee. In additions, I would remind members of the request from Policy and Resources to try and identify wherever possible further savings, in aid of the six hundred and seventy one thousand pound gap which currently exists between budget proposals and the expected figures. Any, yes Mr A couple of comments on that Chair, the first one, on the reduction in carry forwards, my understanding is that, in fact it's quite amusing in some ways, because this, this is something I was accused of as Chair of Resources Management during my year. Er, what in fact this Committee is doing, is saying that at one of the sections that makes up part of it, you happen to have carry forwards spare from last year, therefore use them because we can't identify anything else in budget savings for this, next year. Erm, that isn't necessarily the same as saying by the way your section will have to repeat that saving in future years. I think it's quite legitimate for this Committee to take that twenty thousand because it's there, and to say to itself, post budget we will have to look at the whole of the areas covered by budget protection to find the replicated twenty thousands in future years, and not just expect it to come from registration. Erm, from the comments from the table that seems to be generally agreed. Yet the point, it's a question really, which refers back to the last programme summary three, of the, the ninety four, ninety five base budget. Within that we're, we identified a gross expenditure and a gross income across all areas of the Committee's work. Now clearly some of those are, are outside our direct control. Nevertheless there's five hundred and fourteen thousand as our income that the Fire and Rescue Service, the Fire Training Unit, from the Trading Standards Department, and from Emergency Planning. My question is, has the P A G looked at any ways of increasing any of that income to any degree at all? And if so, what were their findings? We have reviewed charges on, and the Fire Service, erm, in the past, and, and we've increased certain erm, but we didn't see any way we could, we could increase any more at that time. So far as Trading Standards is concerned Chairman, the major income are weights and measures testing fees and they are set down by LACOTS, that's Local Authority Courts on Trad on Trading Standards on er, an agreed scale, so we charge exactly the same as other authorities, for the same, for the same work, and we increase the fees every year, er, in line with erm, the recommendation. Er, the amount that we get, get in depends on erm, the amounts of trade and industry. We've done relatively well in the past couple of years because we've had a lot of petrol pumps, because of the new, the opening of the big supermar the, the supermarkets where there's thirty, forty pumps go going, we make a fair bit of money in that way. But you can't guarantee that, er, and once the supermarket developments er, have gone, then you'll drop off down, down again, and again you're affected by the rece recession, whereas people won't replace things like weighbridges, er, automatic weighing machines that sort of thing during the recession, if you come out of recession, then you might get, and you say you might get some increase in fees in that, that area. But those are always considered er, during the erm, er, revised estimates time in any way. The other one and that erm, the major source of income are court, court costs, and again that depends on the cases you're taking, it depends on the, on the amount awarded by er, magistrates. Over the years, we've taken the risk to increase the court's costs, erm, where we've got agreed pro er, principles, and we've b we've been able to go to the courts and they've agreed with us, for instance, standard fees for overloaded vehicle cases, we charge seventy pounds a time. Er, and the courts by and large agree to erm, give us the seventy pounds out ev every time, but even so, even if we get the award of the costs, then the difficulty is, is, is in getting those costs in. Erm, it's up to the magistrate's clerk and sometimes the first So it's in the Fire Service that we've actually got time posted, and in fact most of the things that we wish to charge for we're actually statutorily prohibited from doing. Things like false alarm calls and so on, have been through the courts and we've been stopped from doing that. We charge the highest rate in the country for issuing fire certificates which is one of the few things which we're actually allowed to charge, and we charge more than virtually any other authority in this country. The trouble about that is, it's now enforced upon us and that's official target, we have to set priority of fire certificates because we need the money, bluntly, otherwise we have to find it elsewhere, so we give them a priority that they wouldn't otherwise have. Er, in terms of training, commercial training and it's not just the Fire and Rescue Service I spoke recently with the Chief Ambulance Officer, who's experiencing the same problems. Training's the first thing that goes, in a recession, that's the first thing that people cut, and not only, well we are achieving the fixed amount of income that we're obliged to in order to make previous reductions, but we're certainly not covering costs. So what you're effectively doing at the moment is subsidizing the private commercial sector. Erm, everything else we've looked at, there are either statutory problems or other problems that prevent us from charging. So it's, if further income generation is limited, it's through external circumstances rather than any internal increases. So we've really, we've really no alternative but to accept the hostage three, one to three on the reductions. It's best as I see it. Erm, salmon paper. We, we've got not alternative, did you say? Well I, I think that that's exactly what the Committee was saying to the Minister there. No, no. We, we, I thought were all saying that we felt that these reductions were actually unacceptable, or totally un almost unacceptable. Erm, there's not a word that's suitable to use actually in this case because we find that they would actually impact upon the service in a serious manner and therefore we don't, Well put it this way, if we were compelled to find the savings they ask, that is the only way we could do it. That's right, we need to put that rider on, that, that we would hope that, obviously would look favourably at er, erm, removing these restrictions on our service if at all possible. It's only specific in item two. Specifically in item two, yes, sorry. Yes, yes, yes. Chair, Sorry, one and three I, I, I think that we've, I, I certainly couldn't accept. We've got to accept the implication of, of item three though, in future years. I think, I think Council is accepting this but I think it's You're changing battle ground there Mr Chairman, to be honest. I think what Mr has said, is quite right, is that this is a carry forward for this year, and er, we've, we're clobbering it taking it up really is what we're saying. So what he's saying we've got to discount it So what he's saying is Next year we wouldn't have a, erm, look and see whether that twenty thousand is coming from the local authority, it's not necessarily in that particular money It's not our calls So what we're saying, or in item, well the last item, implication of further service reduction, with that twenty thousand pound on Fire and Rescue Service will be applicable for this year only? We've said that will be acceptable in P A G Chairman? It's not acceptable, it's not acceptable Chairman, we agreed in the P A G, it wasn't acceptable. It's been spelt out. We threw that one out then. Mm, yes. No way. But it's in, but it's in here isn't it? So we put a, as a rider on, that it had already passed the rider it says there, but we found it unacceptable at P A G. for we're offering them If it has to be found that's the only way. But to us it is unacceptable. Is the exception applied to two? Yes, So we've got to in Trading Standards? Yes, yes, yes. Trading Standards however important, and Trading Standards is very important, erm, when you're getting down to erm, reductions in equipment and uniforms and men, then lives are at risk, it is really a matter of er, er, of, of for our fire fighters that they have the right equipment and the right uniform and when it actually comes down, you can't compare that to maybe reductions in Trading Standards. If, if I can support that Chairman, and what John said also. That's why we couldn't, when we talked about it earlier, use the same word unacceptable, on both item two under Fire Service reductions. Because the Fire and Rescue Service reductions are unacceptable, and I think this Committee should say to, and to leave that in its proposal to Policy Panel and P and R. What things? But when it comes to the Trading Standards Board, what we're saying is, if P and R and Policy Panel this Committee finds seventy thousand pounds' worth of savings, then clearly item two represents a way of doing it. But it represents a way of doing it which is not what the members of this Committee, of all three parties I suspect, want to do. And we would therefore strongly urge them to consider that, and not to take that saving unless it was sort of necessary. Okay. Sounds reasonable to me. Are you all in favour of that then? Yes, as long as this possibly isn't major that we do not agree on? Well the Chairman Are we? So we're all in favour? Yes Right. Capital programme Chair, is that outlined in erm, on the pink pages, if members have any comments to put to David Aha It's er, courtesy, common courtesy. yes, and not going out to find your own knowledge really. You reach a point where you're not certain, then be big enough to say, I don't know, but I can phone our man who does. Absolutely, absolutely no problem. Right, let's get Can you park at the back? Carol, or not? N , er, no, probably no, because we've just, we've just got, we've got three spots, which are ta , are taken most of the week you see, so it's just a bit yes. It's only a very short walk down, if you walk through the shops you don't have to go all the way down, you can actually come, just walk past that shop and go down the middle, and you come out through the car park . Are we ready? Smokers? I've never been on tour, but I've been to the visitor's centre, and Yes. Erm, on page eleven, there's a chart where Because you can all get these things like Guy Fawkes for, but also transcripts for. Welcome to the last session of the day. Yes, er, and we're looking at living assurance. yes Can I explain all those booklets that I've put out on the table? First of all, there's two booklets here, one's a Covermaster and one's for living assurance, which has got your questions answered at the bottom. It's very good for revision, because it's the type of thing your clients are going to be asking you, and it's the type of thing we're going to be asking you tomorrow. So it's a nice way of revising tonight. It's similar to C V T, you really haven't got any notes technically today, so it, it's nice, erm, booklet to use. There's also the living assurance one the same with questions answered. I've also given you a living assurance rate book, because we'll be looking at both the rate books in a minute. And the living assurance, the guide to er, the illnesses that are covered. The critical illness, just a very brief guide there. I think we'll need a box. And a pen, one of those each. One of those each, and finally erm, a circular put out by Abbey entitled Women at Risk, which we'll be talking about. yes Right, so yo , you watched er, Dr. Marius Bernard, erm, the South African, what did you think about the message that came across in the film? What did you think about critical illness assurance? The importance of insurance. It's a very powerful message isn't it? I mean think er, life assurance erm, obviously it's the to have fails, but if somebody is eligible for, and can afford living assurance, it's got to be a brilliant product. I would think there must be a large part of people out there that could benefit from their estates isn't there? I'm, I'm never You're absolutely right, Philip. O K Sue? Can you carry on your domestic discussion tonight, yes? Erm, yes, you're absolutely right. Let me tell you a little bit about the history. Er, when we introduced Covermaster, erm, thirteen years ago or so now, it was a unique plan. It was actually plagiarised by sixteen other life companies within the first six months. It was copied. One company still calls their whole of life protection plan Mastercover,, that's an idea of how much they copied it Erm, but of course, very quickly things moved on. Other contracts were available. Er,b , but we were the first company, back in, I think 1987, to bring out living insurance. It was the first company to actually insure against critical illnesses. It had been done before of course. South Africa in the mid-eighties, it was er, common in the States. But we're the first major company in Britain, so our is second to none, our experience with the contract is second to none. It's very, very powerful. You need living assurance because you're not going to die, you need living assurance because you're not going to die. When you look at er, the critical illnesses that are covered, heart attacks, cancer, stroke, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. I mean is there anybody here, who honestly can't think of anybody who they know, I mean, perhaps if I try and rephrase that, is there anybody here who cannot think of somebody who's suffered an illness that fits into that critical illness er, category. I mean we must all know somebody who's had a heart attack, a stroke, cancer etcetera, etcetera. So we, we understand the implications, and to the money to actually put your life to right, is an absolutely wonderful contract. I said we've got er, the best claims experience, I've given you the one pamphlet, Women at Risk, which points out, women used to say, oh, a stroke it won't happen to me, cancer it won't happen to me. But that is quite useful to show what we've already paid out to women, We, we've got, three over there. Have you got that one somewhere? Yes, Have you already got those? No There erm, somewhere along the line, right. I'll, I'll get you some in a minute, er, I'll carry on if er, if er, you don't mind I've got, oh here we are, I fo , I hadn't given them out sorry. Thank you. So that's very useful to show you how women have been affected but this is on our claims experience. Erm, if you turn over the page it says seventy eight percent of female claims have been on the diagnosis of cancer, and it gives you a breakdown of the condition and the age when diagnosed. All very powerful. A pamphlet that is equally powerful is one called Abbey's Number One for Claims Experience, but unfortunately we don't have any other copies at the moment, so I will leave one on the side so you can look at it. But do ask when you get back to the branch, because it samples claims that Abbey has, have had, erm, it reiterates the statistics that you've just heard, the likelihood of somebody suffering with cancer, heart attacks, strokes etcetera, it er, gives you the ages er, if you choose, write in statistics, the one you've been listening to. Current age, twenty five, the likelihood of somebody having a heart attack or developing cancer before sixty five, heart attack one in ten males, one in thirty nine females, cancer one in ten males, one in ten females. It's, it's horrendous those statistics when you think about it. If we can help people in those circumstances it's got to be a brilliant product. What, what was that leaflet called please? It's Abbey Number One, Abbey, Abbey Life is Number One for Claims, because we were the first company er, if I put it over there now, it will stop me collecting it and taking in out. They are available as I say, but at the moment our's are being updated. So it's an absolutely brilliant product. Now,, if we consider ordinary life assurance, somebody first said to me that er, maybe the best erm, sales manager, or sales promoter or publicist or, or whatever, was the person who actually had the idea of calling death insurance, life insurance, yes? How could you fancy ringing up your potential clients, and say, Hello, it's Carol, I'm calling from Abbey Death. it doesn't sound too good does it? But that's what it is isn't it? Ordinary life assurance really means death insurance. What happens if, let's have a look, and compare it with critical illness. On death, the premiums cease, the sum assured is paid on the living assurance or the Covermaster Plan, living expense is reduced, the widow could work or remarry, a potential answers. Critical illness, you've got carry on paying the premiums, with no lump sum paid on living assur , er, on life assurance, the living expenses are likely to increase, because you may have er, somebody who's disabled, paralysed or whatever, there's no chance of the widow returning to work because she's looking after person who's er, ill, and obviously she can't remarry because she's not widowed at this point. So if you compare critical illness and death with what happens at the time, and I've got to ask you this. What carries you away? Well on death, obviously a car first carries you away, if you're ill it's an ambulance. And one simple statement, which do you see the most of when you're travelling around? How many hearses, how many ambulances do you see? Ambulances. Yes, how many They take them away at night in Telford, so you only see them So it's a brilliant product and there's got to be a need for it. You don't have to die. This year, almost a quarter of million people were known to have cancer. A hundred thousand will still be alive five years later. A lump sum, we won't ask for it back, and maybe it's been useful for them to adapt their lives in the meantime. Brilliant concept. What I want to do though is, is go through the plan, highlighting the differences. It was based on the Covermaster Plan with added extras. So I don't want to go through all the things that are the same, I want to highlight the differences, and maybe it'll help you in your mind to distinguish between the two products as regards examination and the questionnaire tomorrow. First of all with living assurance it's a whole of life plan that pays on, well we know it pays out on death, and we know it pays out on serious illness, but after that, the pay-out is obviously vast compared with Covermaster. Permanent disability, major organ transplant, paralysis, multiple sclerosis, blindness, terminal illness, and loss of limbs. All of which we have in this brochure defined for us. Now one of the areas we can get involved in when we're talking to our clients is well what do they mean by cancer? Does it count as all cancer, what's a definition of a heart attack. This is quite useful for you to refer to, this booklet, but do please tell your clients you're not a doctor, it's very much up to the client's doctor and our medical underwriters, as to whether we pay out or not. This is just a guide, but a very useful guide. Er, for example, we're talking about a heart attack damage to heart muscle, we're talking about strokes where there's a loss fl ,bl , sorry, the flow of blood to the brain, erm, we're talking about cancer, we're talking about an abnormal growth of cells, but not all cancers are covered, a skin cancer which isn't life threatening, isn't covered, erm, as a result of perhaps too much sunbathing etcetera, whereas a melanoma, a cancer that comes into er, a great lump on the skin which can be life-threatening, obviously is. So you have to sort of look carefully. The definitions are here, erm, loss of limbs, yes? Paralysis, when a limb is paralysed there is complete loss of movement and feeling, if you're talking about paralysis, loss of limbs, we're talking about the severance, would you believe, of any two limbs. Would you tell people if it was from above erm, the elbow or above the knee? And also it would . And also? Erm, actually there was a mix-up with that yesterday, we were told one limb, One or more limbs Two Two limbs, Two Two limbs, two limbs, for loss of limb, yes, yes. yes So what I'm saying to you is if you like to refer to this, this will give you the clear definition of what, what's covered in each case. Who can have this plan? Well, the key point there is there's no joint life, last claim. You can write it own life, joint life first claim, or life of another, but you can't l , write it joint life, last claim. Why not, David? Well erm,well probably because it's not going to benefit the person. Absolutely, does it make sense for, for husband and wife over there to wait for the second one to have a heart attack, or the second one to have a cancer before it pays out, Come on It really doesn't make sense does it? What was that Gerald? I said, come on have a heart attack. come and have a heart attack So it doesn't make sense, and obviously it isn't er, written joint life, last claim. Sorry, can I just ask a question there? Certainly. In the question of no joint life, last claim, mhm Right,I've forgotten what I was going to ask now, no it's alright, I was thinking about the circumstances, I was thinking about er, er, a dependent left behind you,sorry. Yes, you, you've sorted it in your own mind? Yes, yes. Good, minimum premiums are the same, twenty pounds and two hundred, but do remember that existing clients, could have a reduced minimum premium of sixteen pounds or a hundred and sixty. What do we mean by an existing client, Shirley? A client that's already got some insurance. Absolutely, and they can actually retain that policy with you that evening. It doesn't have to be one that's issued. So if you start thinking about our client that we've previously erm, who we identified wanted fifty seven thousand pounds worth of life cover, I believe. Maybe the solution would be to put some of that in living assurance, and some of it in Covermaster. Whatever, if we're writing two policies, he can be classed as an existing client, so we could have a reduced minimum. However, do we talk minimum premiums to our clients. No If you tell somebody you can it for as little as sixteen pounds per month, guess what, that what they'll have. If you tell them that to get exactly what they need it's going to cost them thirty pounds a month, and isn't it a brilliant contract, they'll probably have that. O K, let's move on to maximum benefit. What's the maximum benefit on a Covermaster Plan? Five hundred thousand pounds. Five million Five million, or if, five million, we might do a little bit of reinsuring on that one, don't quote me. Erm, the maximum benefit on living assurance is the figure that Janet come up with just, half a million, five hundred thousand. That's actually on all critical illness cover plans, because if they've got a living assurance, or they've got some other plan that's got critical illness benefit, it's the total maximum that Abbey will insure them for, for critical illness, for heart attacks, stroke etcetera. And includes Keyman cover. It includes Keyman cover. This is an interesting statement. If somebody has er, life cover, and living insurance is over a hundred thousand, they will be subject to the need being established. Whatever does that mean? They've got to prove that they actually need that much cover. Right, so how are they going to prove it? Well by showing that their dependents will need that sort of income to come in. Income, we're looking at income. We're looking at financial underwriting. Anything above a hundred thousand, and we're looking at financial underwriting, we're looking at basically four times salary. So if we've got somebody earning nine thousand, they're going to want to know why they're insuring themselves for a hundred thousand on living insurance benefit. O K, so financial underwriting, is on a hundred thousand and above, you look at four times salary. Erm,Right, erm, we get this thorny question now about how to establish how much somebody needs for living assurance. If we just go back to the plan in the future, erm, and we move down to this section here, let's look at the questions we're asking. If you were to become critically ill or disabled, would you like some or all of your life assurance capital sum to be paid to you immediately, if so, how much? Now that's a difficult question to ask people, yes? How much would you like in the event of a heart attack or a stroke, it's very difficult for them to decide. Erm, what type of things do you think would actually affect that decision? Size of the mortgage. Size of the mortgage, that could well be the first point of call isn't it? Which most of us will have a mortgage protected against death, I E, the sum assured is released to repay the loan, what happens if we get a critical illness, heart attack, stroke, etcetera, and can't work. You're still going to have problems repaying your mortgage. So ideally, the size of the mortgage is a good starting point. What other things do you think we could use to determine how much? Erm, If they'll need special care. Yes, but lo , but then we've so , we've got to pre-judge a little bit then, as to what illness they're going to have, and that gets a bit difficult. But you're right, we're, we're taking into account extra costs. Age and , sorry Talk about That's O K, it's about the children Er, Carry on, you go then If the children are er, privately educated, and it's high, high expenses that you would want to carry on with. It might well be something that is very important to you to maintain, even if you can't carry on working through illness. Absolutely right. Age, because you might be considering well, er, if something happens dramatically, at say fifty, fifty two, or something like that, you might just go and retire, so you would be set up in that respect. So how would you determine how much you need? How much the sum assured would be Erm , well by virtue I suppose really, of your operating need, if you like, your, your yearly operating expenses. Yes, you're, you're approaching it from er, a similar method to Sue over there, you're saying how much would I need to, to survive and you're talking small businessmen really, aren't you? In that effect, yes, yes? Sort of, yes. You could be looking at a minimum of one, two, three years' salary, because you might be thinking well at least that'll give me a chance to get on, to get back on my feet. I mean it's a fact isn't it, that there are a lot of people, the first heart attack is just a, a danger signal, you know, beware, take things easy, look after yourself, you've been putting your body under too much stress. But what happens if you're not financially secure, is that you're off work with a heart attack, you're rushing back to work because you need your income. You're putting your body under more stress. So you have another heart attack. Yes, it actually gives you time to recover. It could be length of time your children have got in, in further education. If they're already in college, you might Could well be because you're looking at making sure that they, they fulfil what is a dream for you and for them. It's a similar point to Sue, was making. Absolutely. So it, it could be just debts. Can I just ask a question. It's just slightly off er, the track at the moment, if you were writing a living assurance plan for someone, and they'd already got a Covermaster plan, Mhm, right Or, or other benefits that would actually kick in at a certain point, er, of death, I mean obviously this would actually help at erm, diagnosis, and you're writing into this, sort of to cover all of the things that we're talking about, and they get that, and then they continue to live, the rest of your plans are all then thrown out aren't they, because you've got all those things that you've put into place for death, sorted out in the years before . Right, well, well, actually yes, what, what you look at, is, is what's important to you and you put a cash value on it, and it might be the mortgage, it might be education, it might be giving yourself a couple of years' salary and paying debts or whatever, er, and the security of knowing that O K, if I die, I'm not leaving a problem for my family, but at the same time if I'm in a situation where I get a serious illness and I can't bring in an income, I'm securing my, my, my future in that respect. So of course, after that, your uninsured, which is absolutely true, but at the same time, erm, you're really just bringing forward the pay-out when it's needed most. It's, it's a brilliant contract for single people. You can't, people, single people without dependents are really not very interested in life assurance, because on their death they're dead, you know, as long as they don't leave any debts they're not too bothered. But suddenly they can't be independent if they have er, er, a, an illness, a problem. Suddenly this means a lot to them. Yes? Critical illness cover, that's great. Excuse me a minute. Sorry to interrupt, I've come to collect the packet. Oh right, it's the bag, sorry there isn't one tonight. See you then Thanks for coming then, yes, bye. That's good, I forgot the post. Erm, where was I? What was I talking about? Single people. Single people, brilliant isn't it? Er, there must be a worry in a lot of people, single people's minds what happens to me when I get older and in ill-health, how will I cope? Well if they can afford to buy in help and to sort their life out, you've suddenly got a product that they really want to buy. I mean this, this product, if people have got the health to buy it, because we're obviously not going to take on people that are in poor health, they can afford it, because obviously as they get older, the risk is greater and it becomes more expensive, it sells itself, it really does, it's a brilliant product. Presumably you can it can cost to an existing life policy Absolutely, yes. So that even if you've these benefits, that other life cover would then go on to Absolutely , yes, because an ordinary life policy won't pay out, so if you've got a combination of Covermaster and living assurance, you've got your life policy to pay out on death, and your living assurance to pay out on critical illness. And if it's a sudden death, well, they'll both pay out anyway. Erm, to make it more affordable, you could reduce the life cover, by the amount of life cover on the living master. Yes, yes you could. You'll find what you're doing er, and in a way, it's a comfort to you, that you take, you get all this information, and you take it away, and very often there's not one clear answer. You need to think about the person's circumstances, and that's where it's great, that you can come back and sit down with your manager, and he's going to say to you well what do you think. And he's either going to say well that's great, that's exactly what I would suggest, or have you considered this, have you considered that, which is a great security when you're starting. Er, when you're starting out and you're not sure of all, of all the options. There is a suggested minimum, but if, if, if it's right for the person and they can afford it, that a minimum of forty thousand pounds is, is, is er, er, an industry suggested figure of a minimum. But that's as I say, after looking at mortgage, salaries, etcetera. Waiver of premiums, exactly the same, not exactly the same, sorry, very similar to er, as with Covermaster, it's automatically built into the first life assured, it's payable until you return to work, reach the age of sixty, or pay-out of a claim. I mean, to die is not absolutely correct there is it, because I mean you could actually have a pay-out on critical illness, which happens earlier. But very similar to Covermaster. Built into the first life assured. Does that mean the second life assured can't have it? Presumably no. No, it means they can have it as an option. Why's it built into the first life assured? It's likely the first life would be the man. The first life, well it doesn't have to be the man, but if, if you write the application so It's the breadwinner yes, the breadwinner, the main breadwinner, you're absolutely right. We're talking here of protection, of they can't have waiver of premium because of ill-health, they're not going to be able to have living assurance, so it, it's not an option really for them to have one without the other, because it's an automatic protection that, that really should be the basis of somebody's package of their health commitment to have it. So it's automatically built in to the first life assured, but it is an option for the second if they want it. That's waiver of premium. Again, just to remind you of waiver of premium, this is exactly the same as the Covermaster so you really won't need to cover, copy this, it's charged as we established earlier, as according to your client's age and sex I E how old they are and what gender they are, you can see how the percentage of the premium is established. A joint life charge will calculated as the sum of the individual charges, we looked at that earlier, the maximum age at which waiver of premium can be added to a new policy is fifty five, next birthday. And can I tell you, that if we'd just done Covermaster, somebody could have picked up a point there. Er, maximum age on new policy somebody new can have waiver of premium who's fifty five next birthday. So that's, that should all be very familiar to you. H I V exclusion. That's an interesting one. We've got somebody who's got a living assurance policy with us, it's going to pay out er, on diagnosis of any of those serious illnesses, and then they contract H I V, which if they had originally, we obviously wouldn't give it to them, but they contract it after the policy is enforced. Do you think that we're actually going to pay out the sum assured? Yes yes Mm, Gerald, Ilias, not sure, could do, maybe, yes? Erm, well, we will pay out except under current disability. So we will pay out eventually, but we will not pay out under the permanent disability clause. Er, H I V, the aids virus is a, a debilitating disease, we won't pay out initially because as soon as on diagnosis you could basically say they are, er, they've got a debilitating disease, but we will pay out as soon as the illness actually affects some other part of the body er, and moves in to another disease. Because you don't actually die of H I V do you? You die of something else? No, No what you get from it. Yes, what you get from it. So we will pay out, er, any of the other serious illnesses, paralysis, major organ transplant, etcetera, death, but not on permanent disability. That's the only exclusion. It's not just because this illness is self- , it's self-inflicted er, cause, er, you've obviously picked this up from a variety of other er, I'd say, sources, but you also pick it up in you know, blood transfusions situation. True, yes. Er, once the policy's enforced, we don't look at how somebody's contracted the illness. All we will say is you have a policy with us, you now have H I V, we will pay out eventually, because you, you're going to die, you'll probably die as they are then, or one of these other illnesses will be diagnosed, we just won't pay out on permanent disability. How much of a check do they actually go into if somebody makes a claim on that? In what le ? Well to check all the facts basically, because something like H I V, if, if you're not in a category that's obviously erm, likely to catch it, you know, how would they really know that you've got it or not? The company you mean? The, the Well sometimes the people don't know, but how the company clarifies he had it, knowledge of things before your client contracted it? Well, well there's two things really. The people, if they don't know about it, they can't erm, tell us about it basically. Erm, if they start to have an illness and it develops we'll obviously be talking to their doctor, I mean if it's apparent that they're blind on the form, well then, obviously we would looking the amount we paid, or, or, erm, basically come to some agreement on that. If it was obvious that there'd been a false declaration. If on the other hand if they got it genuinely after the policy was enforced, that's the risk that we take. That's really why the policy is there, isn't it? Er, the risks that peo , they will incur later on. Erm, just on that H I V thing there, is that, isn't it a bit confusing isn't it, in that we don't actually pay out on H I V full stop, on Aids full stop, it is, it's really the other, the other things. They're going to happen aren't they, and H I V is the cause of it, but not, it doesn't cause the death of some oth , you, people don't die of H I V No The, the, the body's immune system gets something further, some of the others No, it's alright, I was looking in here, because I mean, it, I er, you know, I saw in the er, when I looked in the manual it said it didn't pay out on H I V, so it. yes it is confusing. It is confusing, perhaps it doesn't pay out on immediate diagnosis, only when one of the other illnesses takes over yes, And in which case, they've not paid out on the H I V, it's It's later on. It's as a result of And if they are going to pay out full stop. yes It's just prolonging it a little bit. Sorry, just one other point on W O P there, I may have got it wrong, did you say earlier on that er, that if you get H I V, so the W O P benefit isn't payable, what about the al , did we say the allocation of W O P will still continue? yes, you don't, er, once it's established it's not changed at all throughout the plan, so if you, if you get H I V, and you can't have W O P, it's just tough I'm afraid. But on the other hand if you, if get serious illness and, and W O P benefit comes into effect, you've got a load of benefit from it so it's swings and roundabouts, on that then. Ah, so you can still get the W O P benefits from, it's the same as the thing earlier on? It doesn't mean that the W O P is cancelled all together, when If you've got H I V, you, funds at all. Hence we are four hundred and eighty million and whatever is out of pocket. Er we would say that as, that as far as pension funds are concerned, stock lending in that way should be prohibited and the puerilely ca carrying on that er is that er it should be any account for a pension fund should carry the names of pension funds and any transactions involved with pension fund money whether it should be a duty of financial institutions to make sure that any account they were paying money into was a pension fund account. if I may say so is a key point isn't it that a lot of the transactions you've discussed were off-market transactions, they were unusual transactions and the financial institutions that were carrying out those transactions whether they were acting as banker or acting as broker, they would have had knowledge that those transactions were not normal market transactions. So if the law was clear that in those circumstances they should have been on notice and should have therefore watched where the money was going, there wouldn't have been a problem and are we not saying that legitimate stock lending, which I think is what Good is abou is suggesting, if carried on properly on market, would be all right, but if it immediately goes off market into the back doors and back rooms and people can't see what's going on and the financial institutions take part in that, then they are doing something that un undoubtedly is probably going to cause loss to pension funds and shouldn't there be a clear law which makes them liable in those circumstances. you were saying it was wrong anyway weren't you? Oh, I'd say it is w wrong anyway in that er I say it's the it's early er on it in the report Good defines what he determines a trustees duty and as I said to a sort of effectively ought enter into a tr transaction which immediately cost effecting kind of money rather than making money for the pension fund then it is against that duty in the first place, but it's to it should however be ma made explicit that it is against that duty saying stock lending may be okay for a pension fund, but not stock lending where the er pension fund is acting as the borrower rather than the lender. Right, Ken any other points? Er can I I started to comment on about the er, er bank accounts which are you know er my the reaction that I saw was all round the table and I think we would go further that er any company handling pension funds should carry pensions somewhere in their names and all on all their paperwork etcetera so that everybody's totally clear that they are dealing with pension funds and er to agree with a comment that you made in one of your earlier reports that er designation of ownership of shares of pension funds should be clearly er marked on those shares er that also would of er at least alerted these financial institutions, as once again that they were handling stocks belonging to pension fund and they still have ignored it in the case that er they did, but er er they would ha not had the excuse that er apparently some of them have made that er they were not aware that these were pension funds assets. I think still claiming well it's not that I didn't know, but anyway er Ken Er well we did, we were gonna raise a point on that, the clash of the regulatory rules and the duty of under Trust Law, you know, and I, I think there, there was a comment tha that I picked up with Professor Gower you know in his report which I think, where he said the Government obviously have greater confidence than I in reliance on pristine Trust Law in relation to modern commercial developments such as unit trusts and occupational pension schemes, which its founding fathers never contemplated. Now there was nothing in Good really that I think addressed this mismatch between those two types of law. Now I think that, that Good did say oh well, there is a Law Commission Report expected, but I think that you know that Good should address somewhere tha that problem of Trust Law and regulationship and then I did in fact on going through the report and er you know and also your own reports erm there's the one about designation of assets you know, which I think was a very good recommendation of yours. I think the actuarial responsibilities and the wider role of actuaries was important. I think the inde independent corroboration for actuaries was another important factor, custody confirmation by the auditors, veto of transfer of assets, independent auditors for pension funds, independent custodian arrangements, in-house investment management, you made some comments, co-ordination or the various regulators, co-ordination of the professional advisors, establishment of a pension tribunal, you know, now as far as I was concerned or on my sort of looking through it, those were all recommendations that, that you've made over your two years and I couldn't really find any response to those in Good and I think that's a you know we, we personally found that disappointing. Also I mean, we take your point and we've made it before Ken that there's a real danger of asking for a report from someone like Professor Gower and then cherry picking it, instead of actually taking the whole, because it does actually add together in some sort of coherence erm and had Professor Gower's report been accepted in its entirety, we may not have been had the pleasure of having you back again today, but thank you very much er all three of you for coming. Thank you very much. I would suggest is the timescale between these things happening and it getting to the regulator and being digested. In the present didn't understand for two years I mean told the regulator Yes, yes er whereas if there were independent trustees responsible to the regulator and they were properly trained, they would I suggest be able to smell out very quickly an malpractice and would have a group straight to the regulator, if only to call a stop for someone to have a look at it. nothing recommended to Goodey in that particular cause is of any good. I don't think so. Erm er Imperial? I M P A Cs belief is that er if you get the trustee balance right, that's the first place where the decision ought to be made, but there should be a fall back position which Good has given, which they they trustees could go to the regulator in the case of er not being able to solve things, but our feeling very much on surplus is that the money is there first for to pay pensions and until pensions are paid up to Inland Revenue levels whatever they are, then no money should go back to the company. The question of taking pension holidays in between out of surplus is a sort of mid midway position, but er very definitely we feel strongly that money should not go back to the company. We have suffered from the same thing as the other two er Abalance have said today of money being used from our surplus to provide for redundancy and erm it's been exacerbated by money being available from the people who were made, made redundant going to the company and swelling their balance sheets while all the cost side of it comes out of the pension fund and that has caused a lot of ill-feeling particularly from the older pensioners who have seen years of inflation, when their pensions were not made up to the same extent. In the old days when there was a possibility of of erm ad hoc payments made er that sort of thing was taken care of, since the takeover of the company that hasn't happened to the same extent, so there's a very strong feeling with the older pay er pensioners that they paid money into a pension scheme which now shows a surplus, but other people are benefiting from it. We need we've got lots more questions to ask you. Peter? Erm Mrs Appleby you mentioned briefly earlier the role of the regulator. How do you see the regulator doing his job with a hundred and twenty-eight thousand schemes to, to monitor? Great difficulty I would imagine. erm er well we welcome the erm er the proposal that there should be a regulator. Somebody er to whom the erm er matters could be referred to er whom er could remove trustees er who are er not acting in er the best interests er of the fund er to whom er I understand that the erm beneficiaries could er appeal if they felt that their fund was being erm used i in the wrong way, which is something that we haven't got at the moment. Erm I mean just going very, very briefly back to the question that you asked erm about this how would you stop what's happen happening is by having, we would have thought a pensioner trustee, because even the question has been asked how did it get through the union trustees, and the answer that most of them are employed and they are looking over their shoulder because jobs are going, redundancies are being made, you've got a pensioner employee er a pensioner trustee on there, and they're not looking over their shoulder for their job, they are going to do the job of a trustee and watch the fund and they would then be able to go to the regulator if they saw something that was amiss, but if somebody is employed by the firm might be very worried about doing because they're more bothered about keeping their job. Though, the case you're putting that the, the pensioner trustee er ship is more powerful than you originally put, cos up to now you've been put it in grounds that it's the trust should be repr representative of it Yes Now you're saying er rather well, that in fact that person or persons could be more independent Yes. because they're actually not worried about being sacked Yes. either erm because redundancies are coming or as Imperial Trustees found, they were just got ridden of as a way of moving them off the trust. Yeah, very good. large carrots being dangled in front of them. I mean we ought to say in our case approved our the proposals of the company, they raise no objections in which only the who raised objections, the employees didn't and in the High Court case we've just said, how can an employee be independent, when he depends upon his employer for his future work. So really what you're saying is that if we're looking at trip wires to stop things happening, there's a power a really powerful case for a pensioner trustee, but you're looking for whistle blowers. Yes. There's also a powerful case for having pensioner trustees that they will so there's far less chance of erm people twisting their arm, although they could have the carrot dangled in front of them. that's But that's the problem we all face isn't it. And we're also saying that if you have a new pensions act, the work of the regulator will be much easier. Why? You won't keep have to be going off to court to find out what is the law at that moment of time. Touche. Could I, could I turn to one of the major contributors of erm of pension fund surpluses er and that is the plight of the deferred pensioner. The person who leaves the company's employment er could I ask you, each of you in turn briefly for some comments about how you feel deferred pension rights can best be preserved, if they can be preserved at all er adequately. I suppose in one way as a pensioner I shall say what happens about you know I'm not worried about if you're a pensioner because every time one someone becomes a deferred pensioner, our surplus goes up Yes. because the liability is extinguished. Yes. I cannot see why the actuary having a liability for an employee, if that employee becomes a deferred pensioner that the actuary having a liability for the fund But don't Yes they are Can I, you the example you did before to other people was that if you worked you know your normal scheme forty years and if you worked for ten of those forty years you become deferred. Do you have a quarter of the right you would expect if you done the forty years. Is that the sort of way one should underwrite the position as a deferred pensioner Yes Yes What I think my colleague is saying is that when the actuary is assessing the commitments of the funds, he is looking at the anticipated increased earnings until the person retires and I think when the calculation is made for somebody who is er a deferred pensioner of leaving er a pension fund to take his money elsewhere a similar calculation or the same calculation should be used, the one that the actuary last used in, in looking forward and saying what the commitments are. That way the fi the surpluses left behind would be less, but the person transferring and we're going to see more and more of this today er takes a fair amount of money with him. But of course if salaries go up evenly throughout a forty year lifespan and the Chairman is given a forty year lifespan which is quite or pension lifespan which is quite a suitable one, if salaries go up and someone leaves their company every ten years, then the first three departures are obviously going to be at much lower salary levels and it's not going to be satisfactory the first three departures are just index linked to inflation, there is the problem of how does one index link them towards the final salary. Otherwise that person having worked for four different employers during the forty years will not retire on two-thirds of final salary, but will retire on two-thirds er only perhaps the last employer for the last ten years. It isn't a question Chairman but it's easy to ask as it seems,we you said a ten year, but what about a thirty service of deferred pension, that could be an entirely different situation, because that is inflation put under the Post Office and B T ones it's inflation proofed every year, so for the ten years, if he's if he's got another ten years before he draws his pension at sixty, he would have that er deferred pension inflation proofed every year. So a thirty year old service might be entirely different than a person with ten years service deferring his pension. Yes, the reason why we picked a forty year lifespan of work or working life er with four tens was because Professor Good himself told us that er on their research the common employment pattern today is in fact four employers over the working life and of course that is very different from the experience of many pensioners who are drawing today from their pension funds, because many of them were long-term, long-service employees throughout their lives with one employer. But you were saying weren't you you described this world which lots of us now have lost and somebody leaving school starting a job and retiring from that job, so the que the question David's asked you is more important isn't it because deferred pensions are probably gonna become more, not less common. They are becoming a lot more common, yes when you look in the report and accounts there are far, far more of these deferred pensioners there than er than ever used to exist and it's something which I must admit we haven't given a lot of thought to yet, but it's something because it's growing that we will have to address erm in our federation, we will have to address that problem. And the danger presumably is that the surpluses we were having our discussion and debate about earlier on, those surpluses that and I do understand why you feel the pensioners should benefit from their surplus, but it the reality is that the employers and possibly the pensioners are currently arguing amongst themselves for the benefit of those surpluses, but in fact one of the significant contributors is often the deferred pensioners Yes. and the deferred pensioners are not actually getting in on the debate, they're not often represented on the trustees in fact. No, they're n they're not represented, erm but I think we would b you know, I mean I think they, they should get be considered certainly erm dependent upon the length of service which they have put in it's certainly something for the future. I was gonna make a point about the one you raised the practicalities of the situation. I don't know enough actuarial work to be able to and what settlements they should receive, but our own experience is that it's hard enough to round up pensioners to form an association and we embody deferred pensioners and they're even harder. We just don't seem to be able to track them down or attract them in quite the same way, so there is a massive practical problem if you want them to have a voice in how things are done, there's no doubt about that. We have that same problem, but er it can be solved quite easily, the employer knows the addresses of pensioners, there's nothing to stop pensioner association being formed. We are unable to get addresses of our so it's word of mouth how we, how we er include, but why should not the employer send to all pensioners and deferred pensioners notices about the associations. Could I ask you very quickly on that note, do you think the answer is to try and set up a voting mechanism amongst the deferred pensioners, or is the answer that one should actually appoint a professional independent trustee, specifically with the duties of looking after the deferred pensioners in the debates that you have identified often take place? We were told that that is impossible to take a vote because with big organisations like B T and the Post Office one example was to sell off a Girobank there are eight thousand people, but they were just told you can either defer your pension, leave it with the Post Office Pension Fund, transfer it to the Leicester and Alliance who bought Girobank, or take your money out and take up a personal pension scheme. They were given no votes or erm opportunities and of course the same thing will happen if and when the Parcelforce is sold off from the Post Office er there's twenty thousand people there. I doubt very much whether they'll be given any opportunity to voice what happens to them when they're transferred or what happens to the fund. They'll be given the same three options I should imagine. So you would feel probably the best mechanism would be the appointment of somebody who is given that responsibility and solely that responsibility of reporting and looking after the interest of the deferred pensioners. Yes. You would agree with that? Yes I would agree, would favour that because I think it would force another issue, if, if the independent rule too often against the deferred pensioners I suspect they'd organise themselves. You see in British Steel we we have seventy thousand deferred pensioners and er it is a group of people that I feel extremely sorry for, because er in nineteen eighty-six British Steel introduced into their pension scheme while it was still in the public sector, retirement at sixty where with a pension credit spaced on length of service, so if you had thirty-five years service in, you could retire at sixty as if you were sixty-five and there was nothing done at all for deferred pensioners and in certainly our submission to British Steel for seeking improvements, we we asked that they er they look at deferred pensioner with a view to paying their pensions at sixty, recognising that it was a very high-class plane that might have to be er achieved in stages. We also recognise that there is a tremendous problem for deferred pensioners in achieving reasonable transfer values er er er it's a massive problem for them, even where they could find perhaps something to do with that money and a scheme that would do them better, not always, because there, there are people that give bad advice, but there are some that go into it very thoroughly and when it comes down to the bit the transfer value they receive makes it im practically impossible for them to do it. But we've got So we would like er to support what you're saying. We've got six more minutes, David? Er shall I combine my two found questions which the Committee would like to put to you please and, and that is there are two points that really do come out of Maxwell very much, but I think you've had some experience. One is bulk transfers and the second is safeguarding of assets. Er in the context of bulk transfers would you like to comment on the Good Committees conclusions on the bulk transfers of members between schemes and how they operate, and do you think that er there is widespread abuse or do you think er on balance your experience has been that where bulk transfers have taken place, they have taken place responsibly, but I would in that context ask you to comment whether there has been an unreasonable time delay where you have experienced bank bulk transfers between the transfer actually taking place in terms of employees being transferred from an undertaking to another undertaking and the actual transfer of their pension funds. What happened in Maxwell's case was that enormous delays took place between the employees being transferred and the actual transfer of their pension. Er and could you also comment perhaps on the safeguarding of assets and any er points you would like to make in relation to the present five per cent limit on self investment. The er issue of stock lending if you heard the Maxwell pensions earlier on comment on stock lending, whether you think pension funds should do that er in the case of Maxwell as you're probably aware a lot of the stock lending was off market rather than on the market and perhaps you could also comment on the use of independent custodians in terms of the custody of investment. Er I'm sorry to throw all those at you very quickly, but they are er obviously five minutes left and B T th the question about bulk transfers. Sorry no not, British Steel, apologies. Well, I, I'd say one thing by illustration from our own situation er we were transferring bulk and I felt that was singularly unfair because the members were given a choice. The existing members were told you can either join the new scheme with its improved benefits, reduced contributions, with certain rules that were operating in favour of the employer that were against them, but it was a balancing act, or if you don't want that you can stay with the old scheme and continue with exactly the same terms. The third choice was the obvious one you can take your money and get out. Er now we, the pensioners, had no choice, we were picked up and put into the new scheme having paid our contributions appropriately to the old scheme rules which were the higher contributions, but only to pick up the new scheme rules that were against our interest. Now I can see no good reason for that being allowable, I'm not quite sure how you stop it, but I think it it's, it's a basic problem with bulk transfer, the individuals do not have a say. Very good. B T? Well I've already said about the bulk transfer Giro, I quite honestly don't know whether any other option can be given to people, they've given the option to defer their pension with the Post or their present scheme, transferred it new company scheme or take out er the money and take out a personal pension fund er I suppose there might be a possibility of offering people after a certain number past a certain number of years the opportunity to remain within the fund they're in but er the contribution and who, who makes a contribution may be a problem, but that's the only other option I can see. We don't believe that pensioners ought to be forcibly transferred, they should be given the choice. And if that was in the Statute, there would could stop the Indeed, yes. Can we then go back to the other one on safeguarding. Very difficult indeed er hearing the Maxwell people talking earlier I think er again and made that point very clear. I think we can point to some of the things that can happen that worry us. Er if you stand back from our situation and see it that er the contribution rate for employees was reduced from sixty five per cent for er a company i it became a balance of cost and that works out now at five per cent, so the total inputs of the scheme is ten per cent of earnings and that was down from eighteen per cent . Er without being an actuary I say to myself that's a pretty magical thing you've done and then it causes you to start looking at the monetary background of all of that an and again I I'm, I'm speaking here largely on what actuarial advice we are beginning to receive. I think the conclusion coming out of that is that as a result of what I've described and a few other things as well, not least the fact that the company has now capped its contribution rate to no more than ten per cent . When it gets to ten, the members stay at five when the company gets to ten, the damage is picked up by either reducing members benefits or restricted index linking. Now with a hundred and eighty thousand of pensioners and forty thousand scheme members and all of the trustees currently made up of employees and scheme members, it's pretty obvious where any correction of loss of funding is gonna come from isn't it. There can only be one target, it's the pensioners. So er when schemes by the good service of actuaries can be re-written in such extreme terms I begin to worry about it and I think it needs an input for more than one direction on the actuarial fund in our case the trustees saw fit not to use actuaries to get away But on actual safeguarding of assets, erm do you for instance with separate custodians, do you have any views about the custody of your schemes assets? Not, no, I, I've really not given thought to that subject. B T, anything? Well I was impressed by the erm the Maxwell erm peoples comments that the funds should be clearly marked pension fund accounts and and that er there would be regulations that this money couldn't be transferred without some the regulator again or somebody making er agreeing to the transaction, but I erm fully understand that would be erm very time-consuming, but er that's the only way I can see that, that the fund should be clearly marked that they're pension fund and shouldn't be transferred without some some authority agreeing to it. We have separate custodians, the Bank of Scotland are doing this and er I think er having a separate organisation outside is er an important first step, but you've then got to tie up who gives them instructions and that obviously needs careful thought, needs to be done through the trustees. just one question that I wasn't able to put on the Committee's behalf, but I think it is something that we would be very grateful for a short written comment and that is the information that your members, that the members of the pension funds actually er rather than your annual members as well in that context actually receive annually and whether you feel that is satisfactory. We can send you that. Yes, I think also how you feel it could be improved would be very relevant and how you would feel in the context of a pensioners meeting, an annual meeting like shareholders have in companies and how you if you have any views on how such a meeting might be managed in relation to the deferred pensioners interests, the existing pensioners interests, the employees interest and obviously the company's interest being adequately reflected at such a meeting but I think we would welcome that aspect. And also efforts you've made to organise yourself as groups and whether you've been encouraged or not encouraged by the owners of the scheme. Thank you. That would be very helpful. Can I thank you for coming today,th th the media often has lots of comments from the chattering classes, saying unhealthy, British democracies, cos they only concentrate on this place. I, I'm not gonna comment whether I think that's right or not, but anyone viewing your contribution today would know that outside there in the big institutions of our society democracy is very healthy. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you. Thank you. We thank you. Clearly one of the issues we've got though, is t we're looking at something like million pound overspend in C I S for the calendar year ninety three which we've gotta try and pull back, at least some of that. We worked out yesterday that probably the overspend in er client services could be between a hundred and eighty two thousand and half a million, not four hundred depending on which scenario you take. Erm the worst scenario takes into account things like erm whacking in another two people in claims, another four in E W S erm i if you go along with the the current situation on volume increases erm and er the simple choice on those is you either pay pay to cover the service levels or you let the service level deteriorate. Mm. Erm but I mean that's forecast for erm more or less now if the volumes stay as they are, so that's an issue. Erm we've also got an issue with erm the post cock-up and that's a technical term you're laughing at are you? Erm cock-up two people to go to John , erm because erm, apart from anything else it was agreed John 's arm was twisted yesterday to take two people and g and the work but the issue is is that the K doesn't, the issue is is that there is no budget anywhere for it either here or down in John's area. And the reason being is that somebody thought that John was taking the work without having to take people, which he can't do. So John's now taking it on the basis that he takes budget with it so So they are going? Yes they will be going. Ah I mean right Mary'll take them all now Yeah, unfortunately erm Does that mean Richard as well from upstairs or Russell, whatever his name is? Russell Russell Ah I don't know if Russell's going, I mean that's something for them to sort out upstairs. Yeah th they were the two people, it's our two part-timers plus Russell. Oh well that's what it is then, yeah. Yeah okay. But you'll need to sort that out with Mary when she's back, she's not back till after Easter anyway. So when's that happening? Well I'll leave that problem for Mary to sort out. But it, we don't save any money from doing that now anyway. In fact we lose money either way. Erm so that's,tha that that's now been done. Erm now potentially, if you totted up, and there's also the data integrity the other reports, which is the sixty K overspend we talked about, now the question is do we spend that, do we spend that this year, what do we do? Now Sorry what reports are they? Well Phil knows what they are. Well we've we're gonna spend it now anyway. No I mean I've started giving reports out to the sections already Yeah I, I know but Is that units? Units reports? Yeah Yeah. on the data correction exercise. Yeah. Oh But the, the question is until you've fixed them they'll stay in in exclusion right? Yeah. Right, so you fix them just as quickly as you can fix them, but if that takes nine months it takes nine months, that's one of the views you can take on it. Yeah. Erm the issue is is that potentially you could be goi we could've been going for four point three extra people and we probably won't do that. But the ne the ne the other issue is that erm on the Jason front, the overspend on the salary, we might well be able to adjust that down in terms of the overall salary review absorb it within that in July. Five grand across the whole we'll, we'll lose it somewhere. Oh what, the k the difference between him being an A and, and the budget being a C? Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Erm on the other side there are some definite overspends which we've got to do some more work on. Erm there's the P W P five year thing which, which we've got to erm cover for which we've covered as two F T E for the six months and then we'll need to review that after that. Erm we've got the same sort of issue with excess relief. And then there's the, the data integrity on units which is the fourteen we've already made some er nominal provision for which is Mhm quote ten quotes people moving across. Erm, in addition to that there's the erm there's the U A three stuff in the first half of this year which is fourteen people for four months, eight people for two months effectively. Erm then there's billing and collection pensions conversion, regionalization all coming in late. Erm now the impact of those is twofold, one is that we've got the overspend on the data integrity and the U A three, cos it wasn't in the budget at all. And secondly the fact that it wasn't in the budget erm and the fact that they're late means that we're not also realizing the productivity in other areas that we had anticipated so we're gonna be some six months late coming in. Now the potential overspend on the definite ones, the ones I just read out, is two hundred and eighteen thousand. But we reckon that in actual fact if you erm don't do the we just dis discount the billing and collection and the pensions conversions and so on that we will actually get some benefits from the, the, the things that we've already put in place this year, we reckon we can reduce that overspend on that side of it down to about a hundred and eighty two thousand erm because it's, it's nominal paper er transactions in a way. Erm so really the issue is we haven't made any decisions yet, these are the things we've gotta try and make decisions on, but we will need to be starting to think them before we get to June. One of the major problems we've got is that erm the w I did some figures yesterday that, that tended to suggest that in fact our productivity performance overall is about two point seven at the moment even without having had in and without having units in and so on, so we have increased our productivity, marginally, despite the fact we've got temps in and we've got those new business people. Erm Wasn't it in the budget the two point seven for the first two months? Yeah but it's now gone up to two point And increases eight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Erm but the reality is that erm we would therefore need our budget to, in fact for the first half of this year, to have, well for the whole year, to have reflected the late delivery of the systems which would've, if we'd had that in the budget and we'd been projecting the whole budget at say two point six, our budget figure would've been somewhere in the region of another eighty to ninety thousand higher than it currently is for this first quarter. Erm so in actual fact we'd've been there or thereabouts had we not made the budget assumptions that we did. Now one of the major issues that we're concerned about of course is the overtime erm which is, if you review the last three months of the overtime which we did the other day, erm we obviously, we spent the annual budget erm allowance. One of the things that we need to, to work out, and Mark 's gonna do some work on that and, and Maureen pro primarily to identify that erm we're spending about thirty five, thirty six K a month over at the moment. Erm now there's two questions really, one is is that partly to offset the erm lack of productivity that we had anticipated in the budget. So in other words is our F T E consistent with where we actually are rather than where we thought we'd be erm or have we got erm you know er the Parkinson's law, been operating with the, the overtime, people are used to doing it and therefore they keep doing it and so on. One of the other impacts we need to work out in fact is the er effect of the overtime as being worked in quotes, by all the quotes people not just the temps, because that's gonna be a significant chunk. If those, all of those contract temps are regarded as full time people it looks like full time people are working overtime, which is why I asked you the question yesterday erm what's the overtime bill for quotes alone. Cos we've got a hundred percent hundred percent increase in volume Yeah in quotes. And th th the contract people, if they are working overtime, are, are paid the, the premium rates Oh right yeah Yeah. So it's, it's costing us Yes it is costing us, yeah. time and a half. But the point is is that for everybody else there was, there is some assumption that we'd be working off of post driven erm response, okay? So if you got more post in, or your productivity in the servicing sections is down, from two point seven it's down actually at two point six is what we're achieving, we're marginally out. But the, every hour of overtime worked in quotes is in fact an hour actually on our budget, it isn't just a pr proportion of it on our budget which is what you've got everywhere else. So No it's not entirely true cos we did have a budget for overtime Yeah but i if you're gonna go over by a hundred percent and you've got people there working overtime Yeah. significantly every hour that they do on that is gonna be signific is, is not budgeted for cos you've got fourteen people there who weren't budgeted for at all. Yeah. So when you get ten of them working overtime, and that, those ten people weren't budgeted to do any overtime. Yeah. So we need to identify to what extent the o the quotes problem erm is cau is, is skewing the figures primarily to be able to get a forecast view of, okay what's the overtime likely to do over the year? I mean as long as it, as long as the graph is reshaped rather than the massive overspend cos at this rate, we're gonna be spending out er three hundred thousand pounds over just on overtime er which we obviously can't afford to do. Erm but that's if you just progr project forward where we are cos we used up in, in three months what we should have done for the whole year so you've only gotta do that, so we've done a hundred thousand pounds this first quarter and if you've four more, three more quarters there's another three hundred thousand pounds over budget. The point is, one of my points is that two things are, are likely to happen. One is that the, the impact of quotes and the other improvements coming through in the second half of the year will reduce some of that impact anyway and also that that hundred thousand pounds overspend is sig is over-skewed because the proportion of quotes work in there is actually making a, making a difference too. But we need to know by how much. So what we're trying to do is get a picture of, okay, what's our, our best guess scenario, what the whole year's gonna look like. We should have that in a few minutes on the, the quotes side, Mark's gonna bring them in to me. Yeah okay, fine. Erm so I think we've gotta look at that right across the board though, we've gotta know that in actual fact we're covering it temporarily, erm or aren't we covering it temporarily. I think all the work that we did indicates that there the productivity is one issue, that unless you're doing the two point eight or whatever's in the budget, you know, we're not gonna get near it. But the other thing is the work that we did on, all the hours that er aren't available on the team Yeah. and that isn't gonna go away unless we No it isn't, it isn't gonna away but when you go back to these figures we've actually been working, if you wo if you accept that there's been, there's no change in our situation apart from auto-offs and units Mm primarily As from now? As from now. Well th since Right yeah since December Yeah. we should be able to maintain the performance that we've done prior to December cos everything else should be equal. Right? With Yeah or without the T As and, and all, with all the other bits and pieces. So what we need to be able to identify is that,al although we will gain the worst scenario ought to be that whatever we lose in terms of auto-off reports and units reports to some extent we should be gaining by the improved productivity overall. So let's just say it breaks even. So our performance, in terms of F T Es per thousand pound, per thousand item, should be running more or less along at the November December level. Right? Now what we've got here, if you look at the F T for ten thousand in force policies, we've got a significant jump in January and February at a time when our budget posting was down below budget. Now that's fair enough because we've actually bunged more in in terms of testing, we're covered in testing, and we've got temps who are less productive, so to an extent we, we, we, we ou our budget did expect that bump. What we should expect though is that it comes back down to around the three point five mark for the year. Now if that is true then we ought to be able to re- forecast a year getting a reasonable assessment, okay, on what's that going to do. So what I'm saying is that although there will be an overspend, it shouldn't be massive cos the overspend would effectively be the hump right at the beginning of the year. I don't think it's as simple as that because at the time that we were doing the budget, we were doing it really in September, and most of those other cate categories of work, apart from like auto-offs reports and things, weren't having an impact. And all, all the other things we've listed out that have taken up time of the team weren't being done in September. We were doing other things last year. We were doing other things. Loads of other things. I don't think I don't think simply by looking at auto- offs reports or E D S R work is going to solve our problems in time do you? But I don't I don't s No I haven't seen anything that, that actually says, suggests to me that you've got another, any other special cause between now and last autumn. Othe the only other thing that could be in there would be an increase in post, fundamentally. Which we haven't had. Which we haven't had. No. Well we might be having in, in March if eastern region's anything to go by, cos it's had a twenty four percent increase, then it might be a, a double blip, a blip under and a blip over, which would therefore f it would therefore follow that your erm your workload level is gonna be consistent. What we don't know is whether March is a start of a new trend upwards above budget, that's a different scenario cos then you can say okay, just like we talked about with claims and E W S. But if you take the, the servicing sections overall, what we should be able to say is that look okay we're gonna have a delayed kick in of improved productiv because it, productivity cos of new systems that are helping us, whether it moves us from two point six to two point seven to two point eight is arguable, and we won't know that for sure until we get there, but we shouldn't have is deterioration. I don't e I don't see any reason why we should have deterioration. Cos the work that the T As are doing now are just different projects to the one they were doing before. I mean you've had Sue, Sue for example tied up on and all those sort of issues, Bob 's been dealing with pr pension conversions and stuff like that for, for months on end, so we've been dealing with other projects, all that's happened is the work has been redirected onto a different type of project. Now we've lost a lot of resource erm in the clerical area, in this first quarter,t t to release people to go and do testing work we've taken on temps. Now the temps an and the two new business people for example have definitely had an impact on our ability to be as productive as you normally expect to be. That's why I would expect to see and we planned to some extent, we may have under-planned an increase in costs. But I don't see any reason why we shouldn't ever get back to where, to the last quarter, if you're excluding December, of ninety two. That should actually be our benchmark, I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to achieve that. Now the very simple thing is if we just stop doing this other project and get the T As back down on to, if, if we need to do that. But I don't see any reason why our that we shouldn't have the ability, as a man to making management decisions, that makes the productivity and cost profile achievable of at least what it was before Christmas. Now that's all I'm saying. Unless of course we have a significantly increased level of erm of post and then that changes the scenario quite again. Now we're planning to do a, we don't wanna do another budget, re-budget forecast until June July, we, cos it, we don't need to do one for this bu any budget year starting July, we're gonna work on the calendar year. Erm but one of the things that we, that we will need to do is actually to review the overtime for the last three months to say okay, what's it actually been spent on so that we can start to er make sure we've identified the reasons for it. If the reasons for it are accommodating the release of people to, like Pam, Lewis and Ron and people like that whom we've released, erm and the experienced temps then you can at least say when they come back then that position should revert back to the norm. So Some of that's been done though hasn't it? From what erm we did for yesterday. Mm. Some of it, things like the fax service I think which we certainly weren't doing, were we, in the last last year er review and the mechanics of the fax service we already thought that took up a lot of hours you know just putting, faxing them through, receiving them But then you, that outweighs No that ma that's saving us time the, the time wasted on phone calls doesn't it? Yeah. I mean at least when you're getting the faxes and it's being recorded as working there's an enquiry Mm we weren't convinced. When we worked it out as an average that the sheer monitoring and chasing quotes or following up quotes erm and just preparing the documentation, we weren't convinced that was the case at all. You'd expect the productivity to fall wouldn't you, if you were actually operating a fax service because you'd save, you'd take more time to monitor it Er yeah whereas the exact opposite's happened in west, the productivity on the section with the It can't. fax service has shot up, whereas the other one I think it should shoot up. operating a I do. normal service has gone down, so Mm. I don't see any reason why it, why it shouldn't do. Why it shouldn't improve it. Because A you're not wasting the time, you're not worrying about the post sort, you're getting the stuff quicker, you've got the thing logged in and logged out erm so to, to a great extent, I mean er we should be ab I personally think that we should actually s be trying s we should be expecting to see an advantage but let's just take that as as, as, as neutral so that you haven't got a er a worsening situation and you haven't taken adva taken advantage of any Mm er have any advantage in that. We're also running erm without, we must be running without or we've got a significantly reduced level of chase-ups because our turn- rounds are, in most areas, are significantly better than they were. And th and we've sustained that now for several months erm much more so than we did when we did the thing at the end of ninety one. Erm now okay I accept that erm what you're getting now or starting to get through in some areas is a higher degree of expectation, but if we're not achieving that then I think it's something to do with what we're, the way in which we're, we're operating rather than the fact that it isn't achievable. Mm. Okay? So all I'm saying is, if we're not achieving that we need to go back and look at the way in which we're operating the fax service, have a chat with erm Phil's people or Jackie's peo see if there's any differences that we can take advantage of. Are we er are we, you know, gilding the lily? If, cos if we are, we can't afford to. Yeah. It's as simple as that. Erm so I all we're trying to do now at the moment though is, is to, to operate from the point of view of saying look, if you actually take all these things into account, we shouldn't be worse than we were ultimately, once these systems have bedded in, we're doing more checking on letters for example th than, than we w we won't have to once we've checked through the first two months of auto-offs, and we're getting used to the new reports and so on and that sort of stuff, so we expect there to be a blip, but you would expect a learning curve in anyway. That's what I'm saying. So once we're through that we need to be able to say okay, if there is a significant shift in the mix of work, then we need to be able to quantify exactly what that is. Yeah. Okay? But I'd've thought that, that generally speaking, we should have been able to at least hold the line. Cos if we haven't then all of our assumptions into why we're doing things like auto-offs and it improves the outgoing costs and then we've got better reta better information and better screens and all that sort of stuff, I mean it blows every single assumption we've made in a way. You know that you've got, the fact that you can get current statements at the press of a button from July onwards, we should be able to say that means that on the teams that haven't gotta control the work going round to quotes and back again, having it typed and back again, Mm. there should be improvements in those areas. That, that should surely improve turnaround times. Which yeah which are already going down anyway It won't, it won't improve turnaround times generally speaking on the quotes area cos that's kept separate. Doesn't that affect teams? It will it will im Yeah cos improve the overall yeah. It will have an improvement but I, I think we get that almost for free. But it, well what it will do is it will actually mean that you haven't, shouldn't have to worry so much about keeping logs of what you've sent round and, and so on. Mm. So all I'm saying is that that's what we should expect to see. Now the r the truth is, what we've gotta now check out, is actually is that reality, is the reality wildly out. Cos if it is, how much are we gonna have to pay for it, and why and what can we do to try and bring it back in. And that's what we've gotta try and do in the next, next few weeks really. And monitor it very closely. Erm one interesting point about overtime and temps er generally is that temps apparently unl are costing us around about fourteen K with overheads which is a lot more than I believed to be the case. Er and Mark was saying to me yesterday Erm Mark was saying yesterday that, unless you're erm going to be getting overtime done erm by supervisors, in which case temps are cheaper, you're better off using overtime er clerical staff than you are getting temps in. So it's, if you're overtime is at the grade C level, or the workload is at the grade C level, then you're bet it's cheaper to get overtime done than it is to get temps. That's the agency temps I presume? All temps according to Mark. There will be the very few exceptions. Should we not also still go for the, if we can, the one and a half times they work Saturdays? That'll make it even cheaper, instead of double time. No well what we said is we're gon gonna scrap Saturdays unless we s consider it to be critical and unavoidable on the basis that, if they, they can work Saturdays if they'd rather work Saturdays than in the week, but that's their choice not ours But then they get pa they do it get paid for time and a half. Yeah Right. Is, that's the decision from now on is it? Well we, we're saying that now are we? Yeah, I think we should say that, well really, unless we've got anything scheduled in the next week or two, let's get them out the way Does that apply to E W S as well? We've got, we've got two in er April April. Well then let's fill in April, then I think we should actually make sure that we're comfortable that is essential and th that there is overtime being worked there that couldn't have be worked in the week. You know I mean okay talking vast I mean there's the argument I know people vary with their opinions but is it more productive on a Saturday? I think Yeah that's the way mine tend to think it's more productive on a Saturday. I think so. Mine are exactly split. Some think it's a waste of space and others think, you know, it's er Well in er I think you've gotta weigh up the p the productivity element against the cost, cost of it. cost effectiveness I think it must be easy to plan mustn't it if you know you've got that top number of hours from looking at what you've got What essentially what you need to do how to do is if you wanna be able to work Saturdays we need to be able to prove that in fact pound per, per item of post on a Saturday is cheaper than because the productivity in the week will be lower therefore and even at time and a half, the cost of doing an hour's overtime for the work you get out in the week is, is less productive than doing double time with what you get out on a Saturday. If that can be proved then we've got a case. If it isn't then what we should then be saying is no week time over no week time work and just all work Saturdays if you see what I'm getting at. If we can actually demonstrate that, but you've gotta see a significant improvement in your productivity on a Saturday to make it worth your while. But I think it does doesn't it? By the volumes Yeah Prove it. they produce. Yeah. Well we've got plans, Mark you know produced plans with productivity for Saturdays alone. In which case then we should be able to say that Saturday working costs X X pounds per item, and in the week it costs Y pounds per item. If X is cheaper than Y then you've got your case. Then you ban the weekday overtime. Is there certain work there that has to be done during the week and can't wait till the weekend? It will just come down to organization really won't it? Between the teams. Well I think it's an important issue, we need to sq we need to squeeze every, every pound out that we can if we're not to if we're not to affect our service level. But the o the one thing I wanna say is that erm we need to do all we can to keep the c the over-run down to as low a figure as possible, and that's our job. Bob's already indicated that he doesn't, he wants to do everything he possibly can to avoid us having to affect service levels okay, and obviously the overtime is the one thing that really is, stands out as being the issue anything else cos I mean our salary costs are there, there or thereabouts erm with hadn't seen tables like that before, he bought them in Italy somewhere. And they were sawing these slates in into blocks, you know sawing them square like into the size of the slate, they were quite handy. But the time involved to saw them was too much. The other table what we had before was better, was no much so much time involved, by the time you'd screw them round and turn 'em, to saw them into blocks there was a lot of time involved in it. Cos we're loosing a lot on 'em. But they were handy when you had them sawed, cos they were quicker for the slate, I said to er splitter they were quicker then to split 'em up. But we found we were sawing a lot of stuff up, was no good for the slate making, you know it it's got to be good for slate making, a lot of veins and lots of muck in 'em. But the tables were good then but erm too much time involved in them, in in sawing with in them. That's what I found out. W w where they w w once when they'd been installed or was it thought that it a mistake had been made in obviously a lot of cash had been spent on them but erm, was it considered a mis a waste of money or? Well it was a waste well I'll tell you what it was really, he saw a lot of waste on the other tables going on the tip you know, there was a lot of waste going over. Well these tables were doing away with a lot of waste. Getting more slates not so much waste out of them, cos these tables were sawing er them into blocks. There was no what we call, ends on on the slate, you know going over the tip, there was not so much waste with them there as the new tables. Why is it that this machine c c could trim it on all sides? Yeah we used to trim 'em with a hammer and chisel before Yeah. and there was a lot of waste, but these new tables did bring that, it was something for the company it was more than anything, you know cos we were on the bonus system. Slate we wanted to produce we want, you know if there a lot a bit of waste going over the tip, we weren't so much worried bout the waste, cos we was on the bonus we were making the slates and that. But he was worried more about the waste then then ours contract That's what he was cos there was a lot of waste on the old tables, and they make a bit more waste than on these new tables there. Ha ha ha ha how did it come about that you were on you were on one side very firmly and the employers were on the other side very firmly and sides had been had been drawn up? Well I don't think and nobody will turn this you know this he nobody would, he'd put his mind to something and there is nobody on earth that could turn him. Nobody on earth could turn him to do er to er change his mind. And behind him again there was his son-in-law, you know that only he's worse than . Then the one that runs the quarry to us, he's well he's worse only he was behind it in a way, he had he was the one with the brains, he was the one that new how to get the men to work for nothing. He was behind ee he had the brains, and was carrying it out for him, cos erm this erm I dunno if you know him eh, he runs this quarry to us up here. Oh he's terrible there, he even had them he had young girls working for him up there, and they found out they were paying he was paying them too little and then he got caught up with 'em, and erm what he done after he charged for taking them up there in the morning and charged 'em for taking them down in the evening with a Land Rover. So he had them both ways didn't he? He's a terrible man that one. Aye but he was behind the this cos they're all in the in the same boat you know, they're all families, family affair isn't it. But they say the old man didn't have anything to do with it, but I dunno, he could have had something to do with it, I dunno. I I dunno there Can you give some idea of how it came about that you in fact decided strike? When we started well we were in trouble in York When we at then we were going on the go slow system you know, we didn't produce much slate we were on the go work to rule. We let this carry that out for a month or so, and he was very annoyed about it. And then erm the lads in both they had decided they were gonna go on the go slow, but they were told if you go go on the on the go slow system, you're gonna go home, he said, I'm not prepared to carry on with that, he said, the manager there, that's brother that is. When a they were sent home from we went home from this quarry then, and the everybody went home so the the were forty of us in altogether. Everybody went home an, we were all on picket line after. Have you got any idea of w what they thought then of the fact that you were all acting, the three quarries, were acting as erm one body? Well we were all union members, and everybody wanted to be together, if you are if you are in the union well we had to stuck together an the the more we stayed together the stronger we are, to keep out if we can stay out. That's what we always thinking of ain't it. And it was last August, last August Bank Holiday this was started, just before the Bank Holiday weekend when i cos we were all on that gates, Bank Holiday weeks, stopping all the traffic going in there Yea That's how the know is, maybe if we'd a gone back then and,yo you know, if he, he offered us to go back then about September. Yeah to go back to work on this Thursday but we didn't go an all we should have gone then. And tried to get some settlement, but I don't believe it are giving us any settlement cos he wasn't prepared to do anything like that. And I know he had, you know he was stubborn, he wouldn't give in, nobody would he give in to nobody then. He was stupid, stubborn that's what he was. When you first erm when you first came out on strike. Did you have any idea how long you would be out Well everybody thought we'd be out for a week or so, but we were out for a month or er more when these scabs started going back. Well I knew then it was gonna finish off, you know. If more would have gone back then the strike would have come to an end quicker cos, I thought more would have gone back then, but all the lads in they stayed out and nobody went in to work. When the others went back to work, how did you manage to stop anyone else from going back to work? Well all th all these lads that have gone back, they were having a hell of a life in the town of course. If they went for a drink everybody was calling them scabs and if they went anywhere then, some some had their cars sprayed with paint and oh they had everything done, they were all against them. And the still now. The they were scabs then and the scabs now, and they'll always be scabs all their lives now. They will be called scabs wherever they go. Er even e even n now they are marked men yes? Yes they'd like if they were in South Wales, in South Wales you know if your grandfather was a scab, you'd be a scab wouldn't you, they carry it out in generations there. And I believe, in this it's brought a lot of thing in this town there small town like this. Cos these lads now that have gone back, and they were scabs then and they'll scabs they will be all their lives now. Everybody will be looking at them as scabs, wherever they go. No matter what they do they'll always be scabs. No, and as for and I dunno. I suppose they've shot better men than 'em Aye.. Yes Could be. I couldn't have shot any worse I don't think so I don't know what'll happen. Well I'm not worried cos I'm over sixty there, but these lads, I'm worried about these lads, that have mortgages and children to rear up they had lots of worries, and they still have. But these quarry owners they're not worried about them. They just worried about themselves Mm is it rather on the ye yo yo you said earlier on that er the old s s system of striking bargains was on a individual basis? Yes. on, on a team of or a contract of four men. So there's obviously a tradition of people of the quarry men and the quarry owners talking to each other. Yeah. Was the fact that there was no talking going on, completely surprising from the point of view of the tradition of bargaining? Yeah well in the old days, you know everybody was in the union. You couldn't work in the quarry, you couldn't go through the gate in the quarry without being a union man, in the old days there. And there was this system of four men in a bargain, nobody knew the other man's wages, we were all on different wage, everybody was on a different wage. And if you were well in with the staff and the owners of the quarry you'd have more bonus. They'd fix you up with er better bonus, but if you were a black leg they'd er be on less wagers. That's what is was it was a terrible system there, but that was the system, that was the system they carried through the quarries in all the years that are gone. It is contract it's a monthly contract you work for three weeks for one pound sixteen shillings and at the end of the month they count all the slates you've done during the month. And you get this little bonus at the end of the month, maybe a couple of quid on top of your one pound sixteen shillings. That's what they were doing, and then if you made too much slate this month, the following month they'd drop your bonus down, so as to see as to keep you on the same level, so you couldn't go any higher if you if you had good slate and worked your guts out. And the following month they drop you, that's how they used to do it Was there any sense that er you were in fact being put in the same position as your parents had been your your grandparents, had been in in in the sense not being able to get above a certain level by having your wages your bonus cut? Well they I I tell you this they they we'd worked for him for er good many years and there was no talk of any cuts in wages, we had this wages all through the through these years, and everybody was happy with it. Everybody were working on it and everybody was working a g a g a good days work and hard cos slate quarry work has always been hard anyway. But everybody was happy there, and er, till this came along, he's the one that wanted us to work for less. When he came along how could you see things had changed or how could you see in the process of changing? Well straight away the first thing he done was to put these new tables in, and that was his idea when he put these tables in to get more slate, and less wages. I dunno whether he he thought his father paid us too much, I dunno, but erm that's what he had in mind to start with, was drop the wages down thirty pound a week. For everybody. Was there any alteration in the style of management at all? No, not a thing jus we were all working, just on the same, everybody was working,fr real hard but erm. He had that in mind all the time to to cut the wages down, that's what they wanted to do. That's what he wanted to do to from the start, cut the wages down and make more slate, that's what he had in mind. He wasn't prepared to do anything else there no ar and he was he was to have these plant hire, you know these two, when when his old man used to work us us in the quarry, well this was working up there as well, he had lads working on the plant hire for him. He had about a dozen lorries on the road, and machines er working the roads there, all they were working for nothing for him, these lads and he'd come along and before Christmas he'd stop a couple of them, just before Christmas, he used to do that every year. Stop 'em, just before Christmas he used to stop 'em. And my son-in-law he was working with him, and when he had that accident, well it's ridiculous what he done that day. When he reversed that dumper over the tip. Eleven o'clock in the morning, and lost his leg. And he held the wages of the afternoon of him. No I'd r I thought that was really terrible there. Stopping a man's afternoon wages after he lost a leg. Er it was, and he was only paying him twenty two pound a week at the time. Was that considered a hard thing at the time? Very hard, very hard I told the lads I told 'em the union about it what he done that day. Must must be terrible man to do a thing like that eh. And you know is after an accident like that, well, we never, the old slate quarry company wouldn't do that, they'd pay the day off in one a serious accident like that. But that holding the afternoon off him after loosing a leg I think that was really terrible aye. When it became obvious that the strike wasn't going to last a fortnight or it wasn't going to last a month. How did you organize yourselves to stay together? Well we had a meeting every week, a a union meeting, every week. And we had the fantastic help in from South Wales, most thos terribly good er people were terribly good to us in organizing er different things. Many supported us and the present the people. Fantastic I never thought of anything like it, the money was coming in everywhere. They really did help us Aye. W w w w what sort of er p p people or organize or organizations where helping you then? Well union, you know the union in the coal mines and all different well er everywhere in the North Wales here to, postmen, well every union was helping us with them. Organizations and er money coming in everywhere and food parcels. They were helping everybody. I never thought of anything like that, I couldn't believe it. Really fantastic, and there's still money in the fund now, for after it. There was money coming in from overseas, Germany, Belgium, Holland, there wa everywhere helping us. Aye. W w w w were you as erm a large were you organized in any way in ord d er to c con t t t =tinue the strike le le length of time? Well we could a continued it for erm, well I dunno, but erm it was getting a bit out of hand with the picket line really, cos there was a lot of these youngsters who weren't prepared to do these picket line. You know they were coming there this week and they wouldn't come there for three or four weeks or something, thinking with this picket but it was very important to keep that gate, stop everybody from going in there. But there was a lo lots of these youngsters who wouldn't prepared to do this picket business. As they they got fed up with it I suppose I dunno er. But there was no point in carrying it on really you know it. If we'd a carried it on for say this time of the year now you with this erm Whitsun Holiday now, we'd have had to to do it seven days a week, cos you'd have to be there Saturday and Sunday to stop anything going in there . But they weren't prepared to do it were they. You know these youngsters they weren't prepared to stay on that gate. W w w was the the encouragement then for the picket from the older men? Well we c couldn't we had a lot of arguments about it you know in the union meetings about this picket line. But we couldn't make anybody do it, you know they'd say, anyway that we'll do it, there's there's next week they wouldn't catch you up some of them. So er er well we couldn't carry it out, cos the the ones who weren't prepared to do the picket wasn't erm going to do it, we'd have to do more of 'em to keep these youngsters on doing the picket, you know. Where they then a group of people who, to whom the burden of being on p p per picket falling more and more? Yes that's how that's how it was,yes all I was on that gate, I'd been on that gate myself dozens of times. On my own there I I wasn't worried about it er you know. But if one i man does the picket and the others don't, well it's gonna not gonna go show are they. That's what the company wanted us you know to break up on it. They wanted us, if everybody would have gone with me too the picket. That's what these slate quarry owners wanted us for us to fall back. The strike would have fall apart then. That's how it was It had fallen apart with er without. Everybody was standing, they was gonna go out. That's why all these collieries have a different in it. You know these self worth they're so terrible keen aren't they. When you began to make all sort of when c contacts began to be made between erm you and South Wales in terms of support Yeah. D did you get any sort of erm, apart from financial support and material support, did you get any moral support of how a strike should be con conducted? Oh yes they were they were telling us not to pack up there that keep the g gate going and you know they were, keep it going and they they'd er help us. For years to come because if they stay out they give us hundred percent help to carry on with it. But erm I dunno there's some of them weren't prepared to carry on with it, you know these youngsters, there was a lot of 'em they wouldn't, anyway everybody's not hundred percent you're not going to get anywhere with anything. You f emphasized the fact of erm s solidarity fr fr from want of a better word. Yeah. Erm was it in your opinion because the young men had a lot of financial pressures that they they weren't as s solid as the older men let's say or was it because they hadn't No they hadn't a no they they started alright on that picket but as time rolled on and they was getting erm fed up with it, you know they that's how it went as they were getting, oh I we won't go up there today, bugger it. And that's how it happened and you know some weren't prepared to s stay there on the gate an watch that nobody don't go in it er. When you were in, when you were discussing these things in the l lodge meeting erm d d d did the younger men sort of indicate how they felt towards the picket? Oh aye, know these youngsters today, they not er not the same as when we were young I don't think. They don't seem to worry about anything a lot of these youngsters today. You know if you're out on strike you're out on strike and must make it hundred percent, that's how it is. Cos if you do anything you doing you must do it, go at it the right way and stick to it, ain't it. But a lot of these youngsters er you know. There was a few in the lads they were just didn't want to do this picket line. And they were letting the burden on the others weren't they, to do it. And there was lots of the we came to an end and if we were going to carry on with this further we the everybody was getting a bit fed up with it. We were all getting fed up with it cos, having to stay on the gate five hours a day you know, three or four times a week. Was really poor there but I dunno if we'd er stayed there or and carried on with it. Was the er erm attention of the press, the television, the radio, the support of the local M. P., er m ministers in the town, university students, and all the other organizations, was that in in any way a help? Oh yes, it was a help the students give us a fantastic help you know, in financially and the the came on that gate a lots of times with us. They were on that gate with us very often, in the mornings and that. And er the M. P. on this he was up there with us, he was hundred percent too with us. Oh yes, we had fantastic support out of them aye fantastic. Everybody was p hundred percent, everybody. But it was the scabs er that well they put us down to start with, and then the was picket line started cracking up was the these lads not prepared to do it. That how it went out of hand in the end in it. And everybody was getting a bit bored with it cos as it dragged on this is s seven months when you know a long time to be I never thought it would have gone this as long as that when we started off with it. Where you erm aware at all that people were were having serious financial problems? There's quite a few there with had fantastic trouble with their finances you know. Cos the mortgages and that but there's a lot of them, and kids causing it, and Christmas was coming well you know we just, that's when they helped us at Christmas was really fantastic yes, true I never thought anything really out of this world how the how the people helped We got toys and everything for the kids' Christmas, everything you could think of. Nobody or kids were short of a thing, cos erm people from everywhere were sending things. And everybody had a t a twelve pound turkey each. Aye everything was gi really fantastic the people that helped the people that gave to the strike, out of this world I know the help they had was really fantastic. You e mentioned earlier on that people received er food parcels? Yes. Ha ha ha how was this organized? Well the erm the girls were doing all the the wives were doing all the food parcels every week. They were going up to the we call it. And they were organizing food parcels for every striker. And delivering them around on a Friday night and Saturday morning. And it's a really good parcel,th they thought of everything they had everything in the in the food parcel, very good. What sort of things would Oh. you you know sort of had erm eggs, butter, tea, everything you could you needed was in there, and tins of all different kind of soup and were apples, oranges, everything was in there, in the parcel. Really good parcel every week they were having. Would We have received apologies for absence from, er from er Mr . Are there any other apologies which we've received. Thank you. The minutes of the meeting held on the twentieth of October have been er distributed. There is one modification er which has been drawn to our attention that is Mr Ian was present on that day. Subject to that er amendment is it your wish that I should sign those minutes as a true record of that meeting? agreed thank you Er public petitions, none have been received, er other business, none has been notified. Questions none has been received. We therefore move to item one on the agenda which is the local management of primary and secondary schools and I call upon Mr Christopher to introduce the report. Thank you Chairman. The home manual school panel meeting erm on erm for sometime now and I think for those people who don't get to see the government. It is an illustration of how it can, and should be done. Because once the vigorous discussion, rarely does anyone sit and accuse us of having had clearly party political discussions, we had a job of work to do and as a result of that job of work is in front of you now in items one and two. Item one deals with further delegations and aspects of further delegations er to primary and secondary schools. The officers on part of the panel have consulted schools very carefully about the last remnants of possible delegation which might arise and the recommendations are as presented to us in red, set out in section three. Section three point one gives aspects of further delegation which the panel considers after consultation with schools should not be proceeded with in nineteen ninety four, ninety five and justification for that is in the papers which is attached to agenda item one. It should be realised of course that this does not close the door on further delegation each year should indeed there be indication from the schools that they would so wish. Section three point two deals with funding for non pupils with special educational needs. We suggest that this present system which I think many of us have doubts about should continue for practical reasons for nineteen ninety four, ninety five only and for ninety five, ninety six, we will have the benefit of the audit. Three point three has been rather involved er aspects of examining average teachers' salary costs basically will fall down given that we've had a sixty five percent return from schools and we will be able to use this year, coming year the actual mandatory points in determining how delegation of salaries should be proceeded with. Three point four is a small matter, of deputy head whilst it would be inappropriate of course to er schools indefinitely should there be reduction in numbers, certainly we do need a mechanism by which small reductions in numbers don't lead to a tragic and drastic loss of staff. Section three point five is banking needs that er there was quite a lot of current by arrangements, but opt outs use erm, that's an unfortunate word in terms of education and will be allowed for those who are wishing to have alternative arrangements. The panel is still considering the divisional schools library service erm the, they're very clear is at to whether these costs to the library is a fixed cost or a variable cost or perhaps even more to the point that it will need to reach the cost of libraries are fixed and variable and the differing views both within the panel and schools about that and the panel is continuing deliberating research. On that basis I have pleasure in moving the in section six of this report as shown on page five. Thank you. Is there a seconder on that motion? Well further . I further question the policy erm which, erm just mentioned, the average salary issue is that we want, erm that's, that's gonna cost us a million pounds next year, but we are doing it, so there's a million pounds in growth in everybody's er budget and basically everybody's budget when we come to later. Erm on school libraries we're thinking of maintaining school library service and be as, be as fair as possible for schools that are different sizes, that I have erm, that I have erm, erm doing that. . Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. Thank you. We move then to item two the management of the schools, nursery and special schools erm this is er mostly by . Thank you. Erm the speed with which we dealt with item one is encouraging or rather it's somebody might be but item two again maybe if proposals which perhaps er a little controversy. There are two separate issues involved here, first of all there is the issue of nursery education, we have no statutory obligation er to devise scheme for the delegation of nursery schools. Nevertheless failure to do so would cause them problems. First of all nursery schools would be dealing with the County Council on a different basis from the vast of, of the schools population and that will give rise to anomalies and complications which would be undesirous and secondly there might be problems particularly if they are considering expanding nursery provision between nursery schools and nursery classes in primary schools. Both of these can be avoided by delegating nursery schools on a similar basis to the delegation which was made for ordinary schools and again you consulted about that and the proposal laid in this report. And as for all special schools there is an obligation to provide a scheme for local management of special schools with effect from April this year er we consulted there was a little bit of chasing which had to take place in which you can see in section four of the report but following that chasing, we now ascertain meeting schools on favourable proposals for or against and once a week that, a view of and also undertaking as you know. On that basis I will propose happily to suggest that those in, in Section Six of this report. and I second agenda and erm we ask for your attention to para three point four er which is the financial part of this budget really and it says that some contingencies in nursery schools should be increased, erm that it is actually allowed for in the later budget erm the tax payer budget will be . Er Mr . Yes Chairman erm, I'm, I should like to draw attention to the paragraph three, two and wonder what happened to three, three, because er we see it goes from my copy goes from three, two, to three, four, so er I don't know whether there is anything in three, three that I have forgotten, but I, I assume now that I which they're are two other . Erm may in fact find in reading the application of formula rather difficult to cope with because they're very special circumstances and of course the small nursery schools. . erm if there's, if there's a query then indeed I, I, three, three might be one of them. . . . The effective speech. . is there an added speech in what you are referring? Sorry, yes I, I, I, I'm a very, I'm two, appendix B appendix B B er C er, but there isn't three, three erm, other than clairify the erm, all solutions were made available to members of the panel as an appendix to the reports to the Policy Panel er, but that they won't to all members efficiency but were made available that's not the point. there appears to be a in as much as there is a, a section, there is appendix B as the three, two, O, three, three . typographical error, next business . I am assured that it is just a typographical error They would say that wouldn't they. . We are after all teaching these children to count which children? money that motion has been added to. Agreed. Thank you very much. It seems that you all want to hurry on to item three A, erm as far as the timetable is concerned . erm is going to make certain clarifications which we'll start with and is going to introduce the report and then to give some explanations. After that we shall move to the three motions and there will be one debate on all three motions. Chairman er, I have a petition that I have been asked to present er at what point do you wish me to do that? I suggest that, that is er brought maybe before the motions immediately before the motions are put, erm after the motions, after the debate as one debate I am proposing not later than twelve forty five to call for the winding up erm speeches by the three movers of the motions and to take the votes erm prior to lunch. If necessary lunch will constitute an adjournment. Thank you er may I then ask if would er give clarifications on certain items. Thank you Mr Chairman, I just want to cover three areas. The first one has already been mentioned and relates to the actual average salary. The second one is in relation to the sheet in front of you headed school meals and third area erm is the typographical errors on some resolutions to, to take you through . As far as the actual average salary is concerned if you look at page nineteen paragraph K a white page on your report, page nineteen, paragraph K and there you will see that you're promised an audit report on the position relating to teachers' salaries, I can confirm that the position is consistent with the remarks that, that were made earlier on, cos you have within the budget here sufficient money to provide for our current estimate of next year's actual earning salary in these schools . . We have returns so far from sixty five per cent of the schools and we expect to have the remaining schools before the end of the month, I wouldn't expect it to change from where we are at the moment but if there was a significant variation then I will be in a position to report back to the Policy Committee at the end of the month but I'm, I'm not expecting that need be the case. The second area relates to erm school meals and you have in front of you an erratum sheet the sheet outlines two areas of er change relative to erm in the main report. Firstly, I am reporting to you that there has been in the current year additional efficiency savings over and above those that previously anticipated er at the level of two hundred thousand pounds and so we are assuming in the budget erm that those can continue into ninety four, five and thereafter, and then we'll see the resolutions have been amended to take that into account and the text of the erratum sheet explains how that's been done. Appendix ten which is attached to the erratum sheet, it's the seventh page, you'll see there that you've got in front of you all the figures that were really erm concerned with in favour of the and amend er the report on lines fifty four A and fifty four B showing two hundred thousand pounds savings on school meals and you will see that reflected in the columns headed Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats and those are consistent with the resolution papers that are in front of you. Another aspect of this change is the erm the change in line fifty eight, where the business and saving in the current year carried forward has been increased to seven, nine, one, from five, nine, one, you can see in the report and you will see that operated in the new appendix ten. The second aspect of the school meals changes are with that alternative meal saving and would best be introduced erm if members were to decide that this is the way we wanted to go from April ninety five rather than in Sept September ninety four as suggested and attached to the report and that delays the savings, but achieves the same saving but not until nineteen ninety six seven and you will see that the figures have been amended and to take that into account and that's on line fifty four B appendix ten. The third area I need to take you through is some erm typographical amendments to the resolutions that you have in front of you, so if you just bear with me I proposed to go through those and perhaps if you want to mark them on the sheets as I go through and if I'm going too fast erm just wave. The first erm resolution sheet that you have in front of you is a pink one erm so the Labour group there are no typographical errors on the pink sheet. . . . . I have to say these, these are documents in terms of the addition. Erm the next erm feature is the yellow one for the Liberal Democrats, there's one Liberal Democrat typographical error and that's on the second page page four of the resolutions and you'll see that in the second column there's a total three, three, three five, that should be amended to, sorry three, three, three five that should be amended to three, one, five, five and then where it says nine the resource budget immediately below that nine, four, five, ninety four five O, it's three hundred and sixty thousand, three hundred and sixty million, six hundred thousand, that stays the same. The figure that is three, six, one, nine, two O should be changed to three, six, one, seven, four O. Yes. is everybody with me on that one? . . Again the appendix ten figures reflect the, the actual position, all we're doing is amending the resolutions and turn to the blue sheets There are dozens. And the first typo typographical error on the blue sheets is erm item six F. The first figure for section eleven should be three, three eight rather than three, three four and the two totals at the bottom of paragraph six should read three, one, O, eight and two, nine, three, zero. They're academic anyway turn over the page to page six paragraph eight, item D eight D strategy, the figure's is a hundred and six and it should be one, five, six God. and the total should be one, three, three, six in that column . crap. and that's it thank you very much . . Thank you, er Paul, erm I'm now ask er to introduce , County Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the committee the report of the head of finance and myself on each resource budget in nineteen ninety four I think I should start by stressing the process through which we have gone in order to prepare this report has been somewhat different this year from that which we followed in the past and . on, on past experience. . There has been more expensive consultation with head teachers and the governors than has been possible er before and I hope the result of that it is reflected in the pages that you have in front of you. I am grateful both to the Education spokespersons who put a great deal of time in, in order to carry out erm their preparations towards this report and to and to take part in the consultation exercises and to my own colleagues. Erm the fruits of that work will be revealed in the decisions that are made er later on today. I am not intending to go through the report in detail erm but I hope that I we will now need to draw attention to one or two issues erm which are of particular concern and which emerged through the consultation process. First of all the issue of increasing pupil numbers. I am sure that we are all delighted that numbers in schools are now rising because it can be a very difficult situation in which to work when er a head teacher and governing body find themselves trying to manage a continuous decline. At the same time that does create pressures upon the school and in particular it creates pressures upon you in terms of finding the money in order to ensure that those pupils are resourced adequately. You have, therefore, erm a proposal for a figure of over five million pounds to meet the demands of increased pupil numbers er next year and of course that will be a continuing pressure for the future. Secondly, I know that this committee has over a time been concerned about the resource needs of primary schools. We've all been aware of the extent to which the local management formula er has made clear erm the rather er significant difference between the resourcing of pupils in their families primary education and their early years of secondary education. . I hope you it will give particular attention to that issue er in your del deliberations later this morning. Nursery education is an issue which is being drawn to your attention I know over again a number of er months and years. Hertfordshire's position on nursery education is a good one, by comparison with very many other local authorities including many counties. It is an area to which the County Council has given priority in the past. That does not change the fact that as far as parents are concerned if there is no nursery school or nursery class available to them then for them there is no provision at all and I know that you will want to address the question of whether you can find additional resources for nursery education er in the course of the debate. I would also I think put in a word for the work of the joint po policy panel erm which is shared between this committee and the social services committee because it seems to me that it is not for us to be thinking that there is a group of children for who nursery education is necessary er or desirable and a different group of children for whom something else erm is necessary and desirable, largely because of their parents' position. We do have to look at all our pre-school children as a group who have similar means as they grow and they learn and they develop and I hope that we can continue to push for a co-ordinated approach to the whole range of services that we are o offering to that group of children and to their families. Thirdly, special educational needs has been an issue for this committee in the past and will no doubt continue to be an issue in the future. We are continuing to experience a significant er pressure from schools in terms of requests for form assessment and statementing of children with special educational needs. In the current term we are receiving requests at the rate of something like twenty five per week and of course that has the implications both in terms . of handling them through the, through the assessment and statementing process and it has implications in terms of finding the resources to support those children once the statements of provision are, are drawn up. You will not, therefore, be surprised to see a number of items in er the budget report which relates to special needs issues. It is an attempt to ask you to consider to maintain the sort of progress that we have been making erm in past years, but it's a problem is not going to go away. At the present time it is being compounded of course by the er effects of nineteen ninety three Education Act with all that that Act implies or tightening up er many of the processes and procedures that we follow in dealing with special educational needs, we have a host of new draft documents for consultation from the Department for Education. Many of them received just over Christmas and parents and schools are looking to us to give them help er in providing for what is a very rapidly moving situation. Section eleven, Grant you have discussed with this Committee on a number of occasions. I know that the concern is shared right across the Committee about the implications of the reductions which the government is proposing in Section eleven, grant. I think I told you some months ago that I would be asking you to consider that . in the course of your budget debate and er true to form I've brought it in front of you this morning. The need to prepare schools and help to help schools prepare themselves for the erm review of the national curriculum the changes that they will have to deal with and in particular I think, erm to help secondary schools to come to terms with changes in key stage four and the likely erm opportunities there will be for a more diverse curriculum including eventually er the opportunities for more vocational programmes in schools and to assist schools . to build on their own interest and commitment to erm deliver improved pupil attainments at sixteen and, and at eighteen, nineteen, in response the national education and training targets is an area which should not be forgotten. A number of these things that I have already raised this morning are perhaps are, er primary phase issues rather than secondary but we must remember that the pressures on secondary schools continue as in the primary phase and finally another concern which you are all very well aware of and which particularly if you're governors you will have drawn to your attention constantly is erm the continuing concern about our educational building stock both in terms of its adequacy as regards the size and the capacity of the accommodation at, where some schools are concerned its need for repair and maintenance work and its need for adaptation to meet the new demands of the curriculum. Er you have er a substantial er appendix within your er agenda papers which set out proposals from the building's policy panel which would help you to deal with some of those issues. I shall be very brief and simply mention that a number of the savings erm and the increased income that is available to, to avoid savings are the result of your own policies developed over a number of years and I hope implemented with a degree of further manage managerial action which has actually given you some money to spend, erm which will avoid you having to make er painful cuts in order to fund a new growth and in particular I would highlight the significant movement that has has now taken place, children from special educational needs provision outside the county, back into the county. Erm th the reduction in the cost of discretionary awards which is partly the result of the policies that are partly also changing the, in the national situation and increased recruitment funding and in an area into which officers put in a great deal of time to try to make sure that we do the equivalent they should be getting. It is a relief I suppose today, that I am able to speak to you on the basis erm of financial output which is a good deal more favourable than we expected even six months ago. Indeed I think we frightened some schools six months ago erm not by any means er wi malice aforethought if er, because we all thought that the financial situation might be very much worse than it is. Even so, the range of . pressures that this Committee faces and the need to try to balance out the sufficience of needs across a wide range of interest groups and a wide range of, of er pupils and schools means that your decisions are never easy. You need also a course to be provident for the future in terms of ensuring that you will be able to continue to discharge your responsibilities in years to come. It won't be easy erm but the decisions are now for you to make. Thank you Chairman. Thank you er . Erm the John is now are going to explain certain aspects of the er . Thank you Chairman. I just want to draw attention to three major components within the committee report. Erm the first is the base resource budget which is set out on page four, table one. The base resource budget started . with the ninety three, four budget, of three hundred and forty two and a half million and er through the addition of certain growth items most notably that requires the demography for the additional pupil numbers we establish a base resource budget there of three hundred and fifty nine and a half million. A seven million growth over the current ninety three four budget. The second area of the report which I would want to draw your attention to is that area concerned with growth and savings and a number have put forward in sections seven, eight, nine and ten of the report, that on pages six, seven and eight and it's got within those growth and savings that we can work to the target set by the policy committee. The high target of three hundred and sixty two point two million and the low target of three sixty point six million. Then thirdly, I would like to draw your attention to the report of the capital programme er policy programme . where they're putting forward a recommendation for a number of minor and major building projects within the capital guidelines and those are set out in appendix er appendices five and six. Finally, attached to your report er there's appendix ten which is the A three sheets the first sheet has not been changed and the first sheet shows the base resource budget which you are being asked to recommend on line twenty one and then it shows a number of savings which can be achieved through efficiency and volume changes. If those are then accepted, you have a second sheet to appendix ten which has been er modified and which has been circulated just prior to the meeting. That sets out the growth of the savings and which it contains in the report with paragraph and appendix reference numbers on them and it sets out for each of the groups, their proposed budgets. It is from that sheet that the figures were transcribed on to the erm on to the pink and the, the, the, the, erm blue and the yellow sheets which have been circulated and which have been amended so that the figures now correspond on both sheets. . Thank you. Next I was going to ask before erm are there any questions of fact, I don't want anybody anticipating the debate but are the any questions on fact. Mr Martin . Erm er Chairman, may I ask a question on paragraph four, four and appendix three, that's on page four and appendix three on the increased percentage on school milk charge? I see that percentage is quite high, way above the in the in the inflation figure er at seven point five per, er percent and I wonder if I could have an explanation for the reason for that very high increase. The er percentage is identified at the top of appendix three, annexe one of appendix three . Er let me come back on that issue the er right, well the E E C have cut their grants of all school milk I think you'll find certainly on that being discovered I would imagine that it's similar to the County Council. Thank you. May I ask er, er Mr that it would, whether she would now er pass forward the petition. Erm I gather you wish to just present the petition Yes. at this stage but you wish to speak during the debate Tha that is right Chairman,I I have a petition from the Watford Indian association containing seventy five signatures. Er it is about the future provision of section eleven which appears in the main report, you will no doubt appear as part of the budget debate. I think you can see if you look at the er, er around the chamber at the amount of interest that this er has aroused and the, the header referred to the number of other petitions and er, er letters that have been received. Therefore this time, I will just hand it to you Chairman and er, er reserve my rights to . Thank you very much. Thank you. I acknowledge this er receipt of this petition and I'm glad to see the er, er support of the present will change. . Er I understand that er Mr is now ready to respond to the questions. Yes, well erm it it isn't the effect of the changing er E C grant that's elsewhere in the budget and legislative changes item with the increasing cost there er, if you can change the grant or for instance where we're getting less grant from the E C. What it is, is reflecting the intervention crisis of milk oh, oh the cost of milk undoubtedly . going up . it is increasing the price in line the increase in cost of milk So just that, further clarification if I may, we are passing the increase er cost of milk on in the charge that we're making? yes. Thank you. Right now to read er we first call upon Labour er Bob to move the motion standing at the erm . give them some wellie but I don't think I'll do that, erm . . sorry, erm this budget has a very long gestation period er I'm on version twelve I think at the last count and I hope there isn't gonna be a version thirteen. Erm I ought to thank everybody erm, officers, members, head groups, service groups, unionists,petitions and all who've written to us. We've taken all this into account, erm I'm not sure all groups have tried to do that, erm but we have tried to please everyone, we do have some particular priorities and we do want to make significant improvements in service where we can and not necessarily looking for cheap publicity by increasing in lots of places as some people are supposed to of done so where one concludes sometime a significant amount of money in but will have a noticeable difference to their essential service. I am going to go through the pink sheet, I think that's easiest if I do that erm on the top of your pile first the base budget,an this and return to give increase the expenditure is the five million pounds or so needed for the increased number of pupils. Now we're meeting that in full and I'm glad to see that all three fiscal groups er proposing to meet that in full. Of course last year that didn't happen and last year hidden away in the first part of the er the budget papers was this cut in the amount of money going to each pupil erm in education in secondary school, so this year we are not doing that we're going to meet the full cost of so in that sense the formula will be unchanged, and of course there's growth er later in the budget and both primary and secondary schools in terms delegated budgets. We've have already mentioned the million pounds extra for salaries. There's another cost of a million pounds which results from a change in government policy of the cost of government policy, now this is including the er unfair funding of G M schools and including the loss of that was just, just mentioned. Now another of those things will be increased service, that's stand still, that's the best way to stand still. There are other elements later which, which imp improve the coordinated pension for each pupil. Erm well that base budget is rather higher than we are expecting and the time when, the policy committee set its targets for each of the service committees. It's about eighty million pounds higher than we were expecting it. So whereas the policy committee were allowing us three point five million grant maximum, on top of the er base budget, now course that's reduced because with cash limited to the total on to the base plus, so getting a lot less than with the group so they might say increase to about two and a half million rather than the figure we had earlier. So in net terms we can have maximum, we won't go to this in the current till next year, erm two and a half million pounds of growth. That's roughly about the same hours as the government's just decided to spend on sending the Parent's Charter to every household in Britain, I think that's gonna cost over two million as well. Erm the government's there are telling parents what they ought to do. This hypocritical exhortation er which is government policy these days erm is costing them same amount of money, they're actually spending intending, increasing erm education division. I use the phrase hypocritical exhortation, because I know Jim is sitting there with a tape recorder and taking note of all the words we are using today our dictionary so I think the phrase hypocritical exhortation I said three times in relation to . in relation to the Conservative party's current policy back to basics and all that I think is the appropriate expression to bear in mind. Erm, okay let me go on now to er the next section of the, the er resolution, which follows the report in terms of savings erm in para seven of that seven and para eight. Now all groups have savings. Erm another piece of that service on the great wall of justice around this morning erm, I the officers to take certain elsewhere. Moving on to the row on paragraph eight, again all three groups are agreed er on this except with one I think exception of a certain group. Er no one exception, it is supposed to pay seven thousand four hundred and fifty pounds as a toll which in itself was an illegal act of discrimination. Now it is, now this matter has been taken up on behalf of the company, by the constitutary European Member of Parliament John Tomlinson and colleagues. I have here correspondence that has been exchanged between Mr. Tomlinson and the European Commission and German President. Anybody wants some copies I have a few copies here. However, it seems that as far as I can make out from the correspondence, the Commissionaires are split in their opinion as to the legality of action of the German government. Colleagues, this is simply not acceptable and I call on Congress to support this resolution and instruct the E C to raise the matter in the proper government departments. I understand that C E C's accepting this motion and asking for remittance for further consultation. I agree. I move the motion. Thank you. Er, it's not quite correct that that's a new one accepting er and then referring. We're actually gonna be asking for reference, but we're gonna have a look at it and the C E C's people will make that clear. Okay? Er is that seconded three one six? Formally seconded. Thank you very much. Motion three one eight, full car licence new drivers Midland Region to move. John Midlands and East Coast Region moving motion three one eight. Brothers and colleagues statistics show that the majority of car accidents are mainly within the first year of people passing their driving test. At present a person can take a few driving lessons and pass a driving test and he is then free to purchase any type of car they can afford, regardless of how powerful that car is. It doesn't matter that they have very little experience driving cars on our road. As soon as they pass their driving test, they can get out of the supervised test car and hop into a two or three litre car and off they go down the road to possibly death and destruction. Some of them are capable and sensible drivers, but as the records show there are those who not only put their own lives at risk, but that of others as well. At present there are people who choose to display a green learner plate for a period of time after they have passed their test, but this is only optional and may lead to other coloured learner plates being sold which then may not be taken seriously. I believe that we should support the principle of a universal sign which identifies the status of the driver as an important step forward to ensuring safety on our roads. This union has always been at the forefront of health and safety issues within the many industries that we represent. Health and safety also applies on our roads and bearing in mind, we may be acquiring a large transport section, we should be seen to take an interest in not only our members' safety, but the safety of others as well. In the interest of road safety colleagues, I ask that you support the motion. Thank you. President, Conference, Ken Midlands and East Coast Region seconding motion three one eight. Conference, if you think back to all those times that you have sat at home watching the news after a day's work like I have, and listen carefully to what is being said, you may well have been horrified and saddened to hear the many stories appertaining to people who have had accidents or died due to the fact that the machine they have been driving has been too powerful. By obtaining the full car licence, you are able to buy a vehicle which is and can be a lethal weapon in the hands of wrong people, but this motion calls for constraints to be placed upon people when they obtain that full licence and at twelve hundred C C you can have enough power as well as enjoy the driving for the future. We should be looking to educate and train all people a lot more than we do at the moment where driving is concerned, so that from the very moment you pass your test you can feel confident, other people can feel confident and we can all have confidence on the road. Conference, to have a sign in the front and rear of your car may help all new drivers to understand that as a new driver you are entering a system that we are not aware of, speed, which is associated with many other items causes the very things that we work in our day-to-day lives under health and safety to stop. Accidents. Conference, please support I second. Motion three one nine. President, Congress and the Delegates guests. Owen , Midland and East Coast Region. Moving motion three one nine. Congress, it's against the law in this country to ride a bicycle without lights during the hours of darkness. So why are they not fitted to all new pedal cycles during manufacturing? The law has not been adhered to in the recent years, as it was in the past and every night when you're out you usually see more than one cyclist driving without lights, often on the pavement. This causes an hazard to the pedestrians. The modern cycle has enormous gears and other fitments for riding on all types of roads and usually no fitted lights. I stopped a cyclist recently, he weren't very big by the way who was showing no lights. When I asked him why he said it would spoil the looks of his bicycle to have them fitted now. That's a cycle that cost him over two hundred pounds and it would cost him more money to have lights fitted now as an extra. If lights were fitted as a standard requirement during manufacturing of pedal cyclists they could be made to blend in with the colour scheme of the cycle. A major campaign was launched regarding the wearing of cycle helmets and there has been a great response, favourable response to this, cutting down enormously under a number of fatal accidents involving pedal cyclists. So it's now up to Congress to pressurize the manufacturing of cyclists, of cycles to fit rare and rear lights. Sorry, to, I'll say that again to fit front and rear lights during production thus cutting down the number of accidents involving cyclists not showing lights during the hours of darkness even farther. In the meantime Congress, we call upon the police to enforce their powers on cycles, cyclists riding without lights during the hours of darkness. Now I urge you to support. Thank you very much. I'll try not to be as shaky this morning. Whitecliffe , National Race Committee, South Western Region. Yesterday I handed you a message regarding er the request renewed to make a statement over the phrase Black Wednesday, a phrase that was coined by John Smith two days after the event. You have not made that statement. There are four members of the National Race Committee here today and I tell you now Whitecliffe if you do not make the statement Whitecliffe we will walk out of Conference Whitecliffe Thank you aye er, Whitecliffe, it's not a point of order because the point of order has no relevance to this particular debate It has no relevance to this debate but it has Whitecliffe plenty of relevance to the black membership of this union Whitecliffe. Whitecliffe. The point of order has no relevance to this particular debate. I will make the statement at the appropriate time to Congress. We've got the statement here. Don't come back. the statement is here the statement will be made. Second the resolution list. Midlands and East Coast Region. With the increase in public transport costs, road tax and insurance, more and more people are changing to the humble bike as an alternative form of transport. In nineteen seventy nine their sales topped the one and a half million mark. In nineteen ninety two this has risen to two point two million and the indications are the ninety three figures are going to be much higher. In fact told me this is an expanding market. As the favour, biking cannot be beaten, the cost of the average bike is between ninety nine pounds and one hundred and ninety nine pounds. If you compare that cost with the average cost of public transport, you will realize you can soon recoup your initial inlay outlay within six months and unlike cars there are no parking problems. On the debit side biking can be positively dangerous, that is why in nineteen eighty nine Congress passed a motion calling for the provision of cycleways. I move that resolution and on I've yet to see any evidence of them. Delegates I ride a motorbike, so I am familiar with the hazards faced by cyclists, I am also too well aware of the lack of road sense of some cyclists. I'm aware of most of the crazy things they do. They could give kamikaze pilots some lessons! So I tend to give them a wide berth wherever possible. However, much harder to anticipate is their sudden appearance in front of you from nowhere in the dark with lights on and it's not just kids, it's adults who should know better. It's no good depending as Owen said waiting for people to fit lights themselves, they won't because they don't think accidents can happen to them. One accident is one too many. Please support this resolution. Conference wish to put a point of view on several of these motions and I call Frank . Frank responding for the C E C and motions three one four, three one six, three one eight, three one nine and composite eighteen. Congress, the C E C has asked me to accept motion three one four and composite eighteen to refer motions three one six and three one eight and to accept motion three one nine. On motion three one four British Rail Privatization. This government has got to be really be joking with its proposals for example the West Coast Line from north to south is estimated to require in the region of eight hundred million to cover track repairs and modernization as well as outdated rolling stock and signal replacements. All the speeds will have to be reduced for all rolling stock used on that line which will increase the cost for uses of the of that service. Because of privatization plans, British Rail hasn't got any rolling stock on order. If they won't order the stock, do they really expect a new franchisee to do it? I don't think they will. At least not when I'm passing on that cost to you the users and as any cost increase will decrease the use of further track closures will follow. Another example is from region rail which is a totally independent system but over the years the five local authorities have ploughed millions of pounds of investment into improving a system, the stations the track and the rolling stock which in accordance with the Rail Bill will be put out of franchise next year but will anyone have to buy it? No. The company that requires us to pay out the smallest subsidy will be given the franchise and allow to use or probably allow to decay a facility that's been established over the years while it takes its profit and distributes them to its shareholders. On composite eighteen what more needs to be said? This system is used to reduce wages, increase company profits and totally undermine training and health and safety procedures for crews and provide hazards for all the countries around whose coast they sail with the death and environmental problems that follow from accidents such as occurred in the past week. Lives should be, and are, more important than profits through exploitation. Motion three one six refers to tolls on passengers. It appears that German states are opposing a VAT-like tax on in an inconsistent way, aggravated, aggravated by a failure to warn of any increase in the tax in January nineteen ninety three. I would ask you to refer this motion so we can investigate the background more closely. In the view of the C E C motion three one eight has wide implications for a transport industry as a whole and alternate safety measures need to be examined. However, we have no difficulty with the idea that cycles should be fitted with lights. Should many cyclists ignore this law or are hurt as a result, it's always possible for lights to be removed if necessary. Colleagues the C E C is asking you to accept motion three one four and composite eighteen to refer motion three one six and three one eight and to accept motion three one nine. Thank you. Thanks Frank. Conference I propose to take the vote three one four is being accepted by the Executive. All those in favour against. That's carried. Composite eighteen is being supported by the Executive all those in favour against that's carried motion three one six reference is being sought does Birmingham agree? Conference agree? Thanks very much. Motion three one eight reference is being sought does Midland agree? Thanks very much. Conference agree? Motion three one nine is being accepted. All those in favour? Against? That's carried. Colleagues we now turn to the special report, a new concept of trade unionism G M B cooperation with the T & G. I propose that the General Secretary should move this we'll have it formally seconded. We'll then take motion two five five T G W U. Motion two two eight Changing Employment Patterns moved and seconded I will then invite speakers from each of the regions on the Special Report. General Secretary to move. John General Secretary moving the special report and you may have noticed that the television cameras have gone. This is only about the possible er partnership of two of the largest unions in Britain. An organization which if it ever came to be formed will be representing nearly two million people. Pity our media showed a different sense of priorities. But colleagues, five years ago I looked forward to the merger between G M B and Apex and predicted by the year two thousand there would be only four major unions in Britain, call them the four super unions. In fact as you know the world has moved a good deal faster than any of us expected. Last year the A W U was formed and next month UNISON comes into existence. This debate is about how we will respond and in a very real sense, it's about the future of the whole trade union movement in Britain. In the mid eighties we decided that if we were going to be one of the super unions, we had to be amalgamation-friendly. We've been uniquely successful in the amalgamation stakes. Textiles workers, Greater London Staff Association, Apex, tailor and garment workers, they were all wooed by other unions but they all had the good sense to merge into the G M B. In the next few months we'll be joined by members of E F T A T. I am delighted that the Special E F T A T Conference voted in favour of the G M B. I welcome that decision and I pay tribute to the many colleagues who worked so hard to achieve that victory. We'll be seeing the E F T A T colleagues on Thursday, I hope you'll give them a very very warm welcome. That's the good news. The bad news is of course that our successful amalgamation policy has been made against the background of falling union membership. We've done better than most, but our membership levels have suffered as well. High unemployment, anti trade union laws, macho management, they've all had their damaging effect. We all know people who want trade union protection, but dare not join because they fear victimization. Because of political hostility trade union membership in Britain is being held at an artificially low level. If we have the same legal system even as continental Europe, trade union membership in Britain will be at least two million higher than it is today, but let's not delude ourselves. Political spite has done us enormous damage, but it's not the whole story. During the last ten years Britain has changed, very often for the worse, the nature of work has changed and we the trade union Movement have not changed fast enough to keep up with the pace. Think about it for a moment. What are the three pillars that support trade unionism in Britain? Recognition by employers,check-off agreements, reliable shop stewards and activists. Our problem is that one by one these three pillars are crumbling away. Many of you know John here today. He's a distinguished delegate to many many congresses and was London Region Secretary before Paul. The point of mentioning John is that he used to work at the massive Hoover plant in West London. It closed a few years ago, they couldn't knock it down because it was meant to be a prime example of nineteen thirties architecture. John always said that they spent more money restoring the facade than they ever spent on the thousands of workers who worked inside the plant, but then when it closed they couldn't knock it down, so they turned it into a superstore. That seems to me to be a fable from Thatcher's Britain. From manufacturing to retail, from workshop to shop work, from full time to part time. If you look around the towns and cities of Britain, you will find the same story, be it steel plants, those vast chemical plants, the big engineering works, they scarcely exist any more and if they still are there, they've shrunk to a tiny part of their earlier size. The old industrial landmarks are disappearing. Instead we have what I'll call a bits and pieces economy. Service industries, small workplaces, short-term employment, and more and more employers who don't know anything about trade unions and don't want to know. In workplace after workplace we find exploited workers, frightened workers, vulnerable workers, but little chance of recognition no hope of check-off and no one brave enough to come forward as a steward. Our problem, our central problem in the British trade union movement is that we have a trade union movement that operates very comfortably in one world, while over half the people of Britain work in an entirely different world, a world where trade unionism is scarcely ever mentioned and if it is mentioned, it's mentioned with a hint of fear. The challenge set out in the introduction to our report, the first page, it was very carefully written, is to build a new trade unionism on a model to fit this new world. A new concept of trade unionism that offers a vital and effective support system for everyone at work, everyone at work, not just the ones in the big workplaces, but everyone. A new concept that doesn't depend on recognition, doesn't depend of check-off and doesn't depend on representation by shop stewards in every workplace. Where we've got those conditions great, but we've also got to find a trade unionism for the rest and the growing majority of employees in Britain. Now of course we've got some experience in these things and we can put together some sort of picture of what that trade unionism for a new world might look like. The first thing you've go to do is you've got to provide services that mean something to everyone at work. Legal representation very important, maybe also pension schemes that can provide real pension protection. Quick-fire advice down the phone or face-to-face on work-related issues. Then of course you have to ensure that you can offer representation whenever it is needed, but most of all, we've somehow got to create the feeling of lifetime loyalty to the trade union movement and to a particular trade union. Not just a situation where you work in one place and when you leave you leave the union as well. With fast changing employment, there's no future in that. Somehow we've got to say to people we will provide this valuable service to you from your first job until your last breath, wherever you work. If we get recognition, we'll bargain for you, but if you don't, we'll protect and support you in any job you fill. Well, that's just an outline, but it's an outline to meet a need that no other union at the moment is even trying to meet, and what a need, and what a demand. Do you know that nearly nine hundred thousand people walked off the streets of Britain into Citizen Advice Bureaux last year to ask for their help on employment issues because they had no trade union? We could offer a service that no CAB can match. So how do we do it? And this is where I come to the point of cooperation and maybe more with other unions. We don't start from scratch, a plug for the T & G, they started down this track with their own link-up campaign and in the G M B we've pushed forward the frontiers of trade unionism into professional small businesses, legal offices and of course other commercial services. But how do we give a new impetus to that development? Well, we've got somehow to think our way out of the current difficulties. The best chance of success for working people no doubt would be if the two great general unions, the T G W U and the G M B, found a way of doing it together, found a way of creating the most powerful union that has ever existed in Britain. Calling our resources, uniting our activists, achieving by cooperation what we've never achieved by wasteful competition, but then of course that's a vision. And then the practicalities come in, and that's why your Executive is being very cautious in this report. Maybe the task is too ambitious. Maybe a hundred years of history and tradition will defeat us. Maybe the T & G doesn't want a partnership of equals, maybe it wants a takeover. That wouldn't do for us. The G M B won't be a kebab on anyone's skewer. So that's why we move carefully. In all honesty the difficulties are formidable, but I tell you this, for too many years trade unionism has been in the doldrums and with such a prize, however difficult to achieve, it would be a betrayal of our heritage and a betrayal of our members if we don't give it a good hard try. So the report is about the possibility of a grand enterprise. The industrial cooperation between our unions should continue of course. Our members wanted it and in many industries it makes sense, but the bigger task, the main event, is to see whether by a more formal relationship, a more formal partnership, we can build a union which is better than the T & G, better than the G M B and better suited for modern conditions than any trade union so far created in Britain. Now it's important to understand what the Executive is looking for. This is not an amalgamation for its own sake, it is not an amalgamation to manage a continuing and more comfortable decline, it's not bolting together two super unions into one mega union and just hoping for the best. What we should try to create is a flagship of the labour movement. Modern relevant and as successful in recruitment of the workforce of the nineties as we used to be in recruiting the workforce of the sixties and seventies. The flagship of the British labour movement, nothing less, that's the vision, that's what we want to try and create and that's what we want to come back to you and tell you about the prospects next year. That's our vision. The flagship of the labour movement and our task now if you pass this report is to find out whether that flagship can be built. Think about it carefully. I move. We have the report formally rescinded. Thank you very much indeed. I now call motion two five five T G W U London Region to move. President, Congress, Roy London Region moving motion two five five on the T & G. Colleagues, let's make it clear, this motion is not opposed to a merger of the T & G. What it seeks to do is put forward another idea which is to continue to work closely with the T & G on a wide range of jointly agreed . For we desperately need a common approach in such areas as the T U C, on the General Council, on the General Committee and Congress, and more importantly joint roles in the Labour Party. We need to jointly work together in public services if we are to combat the problems faced by the . All that work is positive and in the interests of all our members a slow and measured approach are coming together by general consent, building trust and commitment to a new big union. Colleagues, I believe the building of a trust is the most important fact in the whole of this debate. We shouldn't kid ourselves for in factories and workplaces around the country G M B and T & G are at each other 's throats. That trust will take some building, especially in the Liverpool area region, sorry. This motion calls upon the C E C to seek a structure which would keep both unions autonomous, keeping their structures, their conferences, their regional government etcetera. Let the two unions come together by building the links in the common ground. Colleagues, the C E C statement report told er considered trade unions and its conclusions recommended that preliminary discussions for Transport and General on the feasibility of a merger with a report back on next year's Congress. The danger with that we believe could be that we would set a date for the merger and take all the important issues and discussions, how many regions will it have will we have, the those regions and a hundred and one other problems raised by that merger into a tight timescale. This will only cause problems with consultation with the members and they're the most important, the bloody members, but it could lead to and a scramble for jobs. It could also tie up members of the C E C, the General Secretary, the Regional Secretary, the President, Officers and many others in internal wrangles new union just at the time when we need to look outward in the next two or three years. The danger is it could damage the very relations we tend, we need to build. A structure as I've said previously will give us the vital time and for the detailed discussions and consultations we need if we are to build the trust for the merger we all wish to see. Colleagues, please support the motion. Seconder colleagues for two five five Yes London Region er Group Four Security, have you noticed we've lost another prisoner last night and he nicked me trousers! We er we concur with the General Secretary's er when he said two years ago there will be four super unions by the year two thousand obviously that's gonna be a reality. Er, it's something that will be welcomed by the trade union movement, a new forward, a new beginning to join once again the fruits of our labour with partnership with other unions and the Labour Party which was what we all need, but it must be done with careful planning and the brains at the top of the union must be telling the of the union, the members on the shop floor, the right direction in which to walk. Clearly at the state of the talks with the T & G, we still have a long long way to go to reach this new goal and there's a strong rumour that there has been discussions between Sir John Edmunds and Lord Bill Morris the name of the new union already and I think an apt title for the union at the moment would be Yugoslavia because we're in ethnic groups, we are sections, we've got the boiler makers who are still claiming things they lost ten years ago when they merged. We've got Apex who've been brought in to bring in the new the white collar worker unions to form another concept of trade unionism. Lovely, now me, I'm an ex-M A T S A member, I'm in the security industry, at the moment I haven't got a section, so what am I a Bosnian, a Serbian or a Croatian I don't know. So surely we got to tidy up our own act before we go further forward and as a trade union surely we are to fight unemployment. Now surely will this merger cause er unemployment amongst our staff? Will we need two general secretaries, two presidents, two vice presidents? And then again look, Look at Congress . Obviously, if we're gonna be two big unions obviously Portsmouth is no longer going to fit the bill and I think that's a shame because several congresses I've been to and this is the finest weather I've ever enjoyed. Can't argue with that. And what a lovely place Portsmouth is I must say went to the gentlemen's on, the toilet at the seafront last night and as I left, I looked at the sign that said er, please adjust your dress before you leave. That's equality for you. And then what are we gonna have? Are we gonna have an annual congress, a bi-annual congress, a tri-annual congress? When are we gonna have rules revisions, there's a long way to go and as the, the er General Secretary said, be careful, because I've been to talks with, on, from the Regional Committee with the T & G yes we got on lovely with them, they're fine, they, they gave us a nice big er commemorative medal of the dockers' strike and it's got my granddad and my great granddad on it cos they was there in the other union mind you while we've done all the striking and that they stood by, but nevertheless they're not bad lads anyway and as John said we must be careful that we are not the ones that are gonna be taken over, because I remember that old song of the fifties, never smile at a crocodile don't be taken in by his welcome grin, he's imagining how well you'll fit beneath his skin . Brothers, sisters, President, we've still got a long way to go. General Secretary, you may be ready to dive in now, but we but we want to wait till the time is right. I second. Goodness me, keep taking the tablets. Motion two two eight Midland Region to move. Can't follow that. President, Congress Bob Midlands and East Coast Region moving motion two two eight. Changing employment patterns. Many of the points that I make in this speech have already been covered by John, but they are important and deserve to be repeated. The matters of employing people is changing and in the main those changes fly in the face of traditional G M B organization and make recruitment and retention of membership more difficult. Whatever the reasons for these changes, be they because of a hostile government, new technology or the European dimension, we must respond and change if we are to survive as a creditable organization. The employment situation described in the motion are no longer the exception, they are the rule and as such we must sharpen up our recruitment act. That is not to say we should adopt the hard sell or abandon our traditional value, but we must seriously examine how we can appeal to more desperate scattered membership. We must seriously examine how we can involve such membership in the decision making of the Union and carry them with us through change. We must seriously examine the relevance and method of delivery of our range of benefits. How can we appeal to part time workers and convince them that we can change things for the better, many of whom are home workers who are working in appalling conditions and often for less than fifty pence an hour? What can we do for members in small workplaces where even basic health and safety standards are exempt by law? How shall we respond to the loss of check-off as the proposed legislation means we surely will? How can we react to the loss of local authority standards of paying conditions and negotiation practices? How can we service and maintain our appeal to members opting to work in Europe and how can we recruit Europeans working here? Clearly this is a wide ranging motion designed to provoke thought and debate with no easy answers. I welcome the decision of the C E C to examine the issues involved in greater detail. I move. Liz Midlands and East Coast. The speaker from the Northern Region will get on very well with my three year old granddaughter, she don't like crocodiles either. However, in the interest of brevity, I will my remarks to points A and B. Since nineteen seventy nine there's been a major shift away from our industrial base towards service industries. Consequently part time work and casual work is now a significant feature of our economy. Effectively we've become a low-waged, low-skilled economy with virtually no protection for many of our fellow workers. At the same time, home working is on the increase, it's been estimated one million people do paid work at home, seventy three percent of which are women. They take on this work, not for pin money, but to provide for their family's basic needs. They are forced into accepting low paid jobs, exposed to health hazards with no job protection because of family responsibilities or affordable child care. You know delegates, when most people think about home working, they really think beyond the traditional jobs associated with this group of workers. I recently read the A B C of Homeworking, it was quite never mind, I can't say the damn word, I could see very clearly, the potential for injury and exposure to other hazards is frightening. I fear the element is the growth of white collar working. It's my guess and it's an educated guess, within the next decade this growth will speed up partly because of new technology and the employer's needs to cut costs and maximize profits. You know delegates, this resolution is about recruitment and retention, but it's also about the ideals on which this movement of ours was founded. If as a union we are to meet the challenges that lie ahead, then please support this resolution. If not, we can stand here like and get our feet wet, because that's what's gonna happen. Please support. Thanks very much indeed Liz. Colleagues, I now come back to the special report and will take speakers from the regions. Liverpool Region. If colleagues from the back of Congress are intending to speak, if they could come forward. Alan Liverpool Region. President, Congress, Liverpool Region support the document. We do need closer links, not only with the T & G but also with other unions, but let's not forget that other unions are organizing to build up their membership at the expense of the G M B. We need to make up our minds do we want an amalgamation or not. If we do, we must act quickly because our members in the Health Service, Local Authorities and all public services are in danger of being approached by the creation of UNISON. Our craft members are in danger of being approached by the A W E U Alan, Alan I'm sorry to interrupt you, I do apologize. Colleagues this is a very important matter. I'm sure we're all agreed about that. So let's have the best of order for the speakers please. Right Alan Thank you President. Our craft members are in danger of being poached by the A W E U. An amalgamation may not be some people's ideal, but it will take away a lot of the friction between the two unions. We will only have one set of policies and one set of rules. There would also be another benefit in amalgamation. We would get back the two and a half thousand members the T & G poached in Liverpool City Council. One final point, the Liverpool Regional Council strongly recommended that amalgamation talks should start as soon as possible. Scotland. President, Colleagues, Geoff G M B Scotland. Supporting the C E C Report. Colleagues, G M B Scotland welcomes and congratulates the Central Executive's initiative in bringing forward the of this Congress the big important debate of this Congress between ourselves and the Transport and General Workers' Union at some time in the future. The paper quite rightly says and I quote the relationship between the T G W U and the G M B has all been marked by a blend of competition and co-operation . It then goes on to detail a number of joint initiatives covering the the country and all the G M B regions. To be fair, the C E C have not tried to say that everything in the garden is rosy, they've also highlighted a number of problem areas that still exist. Indeed all look at the recent decision by the and Allied Trade Union to the members who have amalgamated themselves Transport and General Workers. It's only dirty tricks and underhanded tactics used by the T & G during the approach of the Workers' Union so must realize Congress, to be more positive, one of the major benefits or more, the major benefit from future amalgamation with the T & G would be the free help of officials from both unions and and negotiations both national, regional and even at times individual company level where both unions help members. Colleagues, the time gained by having only one and recruitment and on negotiations rather at least two could be much better utilized than the certain, the day to day needs of membership. Colleagues, G M B Scotland subscribe to review that the benefits from the future amalgamation between the two great general unions within the United Kingdom would by far any possible deficits. Congress, G M B Scotland supports. London Region. Congress, President. Ed Westminster Trade Union Political Staffs Branch, London Region. Congress, I'm a Labour Councillor and whenever I sit on the Council I also ask Conservative members to declare their interest before they speak on an issue, so I better declare mine. When I first went to work, I went and joined the union, there wasn't one in the factory I was working in and so I went to the nearest er trade union office and joined. That union supported me as I recruited the whole of the workforce and er, I was then sacked after four weeks! Some things don't change! The union then supported me further when I got another job and was a steward there, a branch secretary a district committee member and then on the regional committee and they also helped to put me through polytechnic and into the job that I did looking at mergers at the University of Warwick. That union was the Transport and General Workers' Union. That's my interest. Having looked at mergers then from both sides, I've seen the prejudices that go into any debate that takes place between any unions coming together. Obviously unions have their own traditions and their own ways of doing things in their own organizational structures. Clearly in any merger between the G M B and the T & G there are big hurdles to overcome. There are, and I know because I've seen both sets of prejudices, prejudices from both sides. The T & G traditionally have looked at the G M B as er look down at sometimes at the G M B. I've heard them described before as the sweepers up union and various other things. Derogatory terms. I came into the G M B and heard exactly the same kind of derogatory comments about the Transport and General Workers' Union. Comrades we must put to one side these kind of, this kind of fighting. We must I think look to go forward together. The union movement is under attack, we cannot afford ever to waste our resources on fighting each other we should look to always work together. However in doing so, it is important that we take time, because time allows people to come together in a sensible way, not to be forced together. We don't need to see er leaflets and so on urging us into merger before they're actually ready to take place from the membership itself. Go steadily forward, work towards the merger, but don't force it too quickly. I support the document Midland Region President, Conference Alan Midland and East Coast Region, opposing the C E C document. Conference my region isn't against amalgamations with other unions. The G M B's got a long record of joining forces with others which has proved to be successful, but if we're gonna be honest, it's always been recognized that we would be the predominant union and yes Apex members we should have been honest with you at the time of merger, because it's quite clear you was gonna lose your identity to at least to some extent and we should have been honest about that. The only thing I would say delegates is that the we will also swallow the goldfish and there's a message in that for all of us. A merger with the Transport and General Workers' Union will be like any other previous arrangements. The problems that are gonna manifest themselves will any possible advantages. Consider for example what's gonna happen to the rulebook and to our structures. Let's think about the number of regions we have, the T & G have got seven, we've got ten. Perhaps we'll lose a region, or three. How regional councils and the C E C operate? What I do know we'll, we'll to get everyone in. How are we going to organize Congress? Perhaps President we could solve the problem by the T & G having theirs one year and us the next. I suppose that's that kind of bi-annual arrangement. What's going to happen to the Regional Committees, to officers and staff? These will be the issues that'll concentrate but more importantly, what's in the best interest of our members? Will their concerns be at the forefront of people's minds once the powerbroking bloodletting starts, and blood will be spilt you know. Ask the T & G officers what they think to the way they were when the redundancy notices were handed out so full time officers in the in the audience, be careful cos you're going don't be under any illusion when your region, your job, or your elected position is under threat, it's human nature to protect your back and when this happens, it's the members who end up being the casualties. Conference, the document quite rightly identifies the common ground between our two unions. It points to the cooperation which already exists. So why do we need to formalize these arrangements, why rock the boat at time when the political climate is ? You don't believe for a minute that this government will stand by while the two biggest general unions get together, no way, they'll attack us in any way they can and I warn ya they haven't run out of ideas yet. I'm all in favour of fighting the Tories to protect our members' interest, but we won't be doing much fighting because we'll be using all our efforts sorting out internal squabbles. We can also expect de-recognition by employers who are frightened to death by the T & G. It it's already happening. I tell you another year of feasibility studies will take us to the point of no return. Bill the and John started holding hands about a year ago and it's already resulted in their engagement and it's clear that they're planning their big day for the summer of next year! We should tell them to forget about having their banns read and advise them stay just good friends. Colleagues we have an opportunity today to vote this document down, to vote against it because the future of our union and the interests of our members is at risk. Let's take it and prevent a constructive back issues have turned out some previous lectures but you can pick them up afterwards rather than now. Today still unfortunate cos you've got a two page handout. Why? Cos they do little trees on them which takes space. Er, well this, this is the last week at Kings term which means that this is the last lecture in this series so if you come back next week you'll be disappointed. Erm the service continues next term with me starting and then Mike taking over half way through and what I'll be doing is supplying the general two theoried two theoretic semantics that I've been talking about erm two specific instructions in a natural language I can get what six definite descriptions and names something like that. So today I'm going to talk about notions of structure or about sentence structure and logical form, so point one a reminder something that I keep saying, knowledge of language is knowledge of a bod a body of rules that assign phonological, syntactic and semantic properties to words and sentences. Thanks. You've got a box in your head and it's got rules of those three types, at least those three types . Erm now, something that puzzled me for quite a long time when I started out doing philosophy of language er one or two years ago erm frequently you hear claims or we hear claims to the effect that this is a logical form of this sentence or this is the structure of this sentence, or this is the semantic structure of this sentence and I was never quite sure what that actually meant erm it's partly because apart from Davidson, erm a lot of people who write on these issues don't actually tell you what the background theory is and exactly what the point of the assignment of structured sentences is supposed to be, erm however after thinking about it for a while, I've arrived at the following following general view there are at least three rather different enterprises er which might lead you to assign sentence structure and er one needs to figure out the relations between them. So point, sentence structure. There are three distinct projects logic, syntax and semantics which might lead you, which do lead you to assign structures to sentences. Logical structure accounts for certain inferential relations among sentences. I'm gonna elaborate on all these a bit in syntax a lot as we proceed. Syntactic structure accounts for well and ill-formedness. Semantic structure accounts for the derivation of meanings of complex expressions from those of their components. It's not obvious a priori whether all or any pair of these projects converge on a single set of structures. And now just to spend the rest of the lecture elaborating on what I just said. So logic first erm point three. Logic needs to account for logical relations among sentences the sort that we'll learn about in elementary symbolic logic. For example, needs to account for why if the sentence P and Q is true, then so is the sentence Q and in order to do that it assigns a certain structure, for example as on the handout in my assigned structure and brackets P Q. Erm anyway erm it just has and has a separate particle operating on two distinct sentences that are not ordered syntax needs to account for the well-formedness of the structure, sorry P and Q. The ill-formedness of P Q and the similar grouping of and with or that is in English between sentences and where you can find one and find another but not with, not you don't say John loves Mary not Peter loves Jill. A slightly more subtle data the well-formedness of the following dialogue Sally likes Jill yes, and she likes Mary versus the ill-formedness of Sally likes Jill yes, she likes Mary and. Well what this suggests is that and she likes Mary accounts as a legitimate string with and at the beginning of the sentence, but she likes Mary doesn't, so you can't stick and at the end of the sentence. Thanks for . Okay, erm okay moving on to semantics, we're half way through point three. Semantics needs to account for our understanding of P and Q on the basis of our understanding of P, Q, and and. It might just assign a structure P and Q, three separate constituents between their structure. In each case the assignment is part of a large theory with its own particular data and goals. So it's a priori possible that the three projects don't converge. Erm okay I'm going to talk about syntax mostly erm is everybody happy with the, the role that the assignment of structure plays in, in logics and semantics? I'll come back to semantics a bit at the end. But if you remember your symbolic logics there should be no problems. That rules deduction rules of whatever kind er derivation rules or rules er applied to sentences in logic on the basis of the structure brackets what kind of connectives you have and so on. Okay. Semantic syntax and then afterwards the relation between syntax and semantics so I'm actually going to do some real syntax. Lesson one in syntax. Point four erm sentences are made up of noun phrases and verb phrases those phrases can be composed of intransitive verbs standing alone, or transitive verbs and objects so you can have four, the structure what sounds like Florence smiled actually has a structure as on the handout in the sentence composed of a noun phrase and a verb phrase, the noun phrase contains a single noun Florence and the verb phrase contains a single verb smile or you can have something like four two, Florence teased Dougal and there the verb phrase contains the verb teased and another noun phrase containing the single noun Dougal. Okay, that's the question is why, why does it have that structure? It might be that the subject noun and verb phrase go together to form a constituent, so you have Florence teased Dougal or the structure might not be that it might just be three separate constituents with no firm structure forming a further constituent, so why that structure? Okay, well I shall now give you evidence for that some which is straightforward, some which is a little bit more subtle. So point five, evidence for verb phrase structure. First of all ellipsis. This is where you drop something from a sentence or phrase and you leave a word or a phrase out. You can often allow a verb and an object together, but never a subject and a verb, so sentence three and five you can say Florence said she teased Dougal and she did, I E she did tease Dougal, but sentence four is ill-formed. Florence said she teased Dougal and Dougal, which is what you'd get if you allowed it and Florence teased, so you can allow teased Dougal, but you can't allow Florence teased. So here's the hypothesis to explain that ellipsis is confined to constituents where constituents are just what they sound like, genuine components of a larger thing which is signalled by sticking brackets, labelled brackets round them so they make a phrase and you can do certain things with them. Okay. Second, four B, erm the proform substitution where a proform is like a pronoun or a proverb or if you fancy a pro-sentence erm sentence five Florence teased Dougal, and Brian did so too did so means teased Dougal the sentence for that is a proform. That's fine but sentence six Florence teased Dougal, and did so Brian too doesn't sound right but notice that's exactly what you would get if you could substitute the proform for a subject verb construction and then it would mean Florence teased Brian too. Okay? C, the third piece of evidence idioms tend to be either whole sentences or noun phrases or verb object instructions, but never verb subject or rather subject verb instructions. When an idiom is just something that has the form of, has a certain apparent grammatical form but actually occurs just as a single unit of a fixed meaning, so it has no genuine semantic structure from which you can determine its meaning, for example kick the bucket means die and you don't get that in the meaning of kick the bucket. but notice kick the bucket appears as a verb phrase and eat humble pie, get your knickers in a twist and so on. So if you just generally think about the idioms like that, frozen pieces of language and fixed meanings you'll find they come in formed sentences and subject expressions and verb phrases but not subject verb. Could you say I walk, I walk? I walk? By idiom? Yeah. Erm well really it's just what I said, it's er roughly speaking it's when er a string of words doesn't have the meaning you'd expect on the basis of the standard semantics of the language, but rather has a fixed different meaning and whenever there's any apparent structure in it, I E several words, er, their, their normal meanings are irrelevant which is the meaning of the whole phrase. So like I said kick the bucket, the meaning of that idiomatically is just die, sorry die. It's a metaphorical meaning originally? Er, it might be I don't know in this particular case. It often comes about that way, it starts as a, a metaphor and then gets frozen. What do you mean subject verbs and ? Er what I actually mean is whenever you have an idiom, you can substitute in the position of a whole sentence or of a verb phrase, but you can't substitute it for a subject and a verb, leaving the object of the sentence intact. Yeah, so, so Okay then the general I'm for is that in a subject verb object sentence there's very important sense in which the verb and the object go together, they form one unit and one constituent of a sentence, whereas subject and verb don't. So in point of fact idioms is you'll find that they always fit in either this slot or in this slot, but you won't find an idiom which has to form such that if you remove the subject and verb from a sentence you can stick the idiom in there and it will make sense. You're the literary one. A, because it's not an idiom, and B even if it were it would be a whole sentence, because walk is intransitive. Well think about it I mean there might be one, in which case we have to do a little bit er dancing around Why doesn't the idiom just take the place of the verb, because if you get rid of the object as well? Well it's a verb phrase so erm they just, all that means is if you take a subject expression and well, what goes, what goes after such expression is a verb phrase, that my opinion not just you know . So, although in all these three, kick the bucket, eat humble pie, get your knickers in a twist er all look like fairly complex transitive constructions. They look as though they they don't really they actually intransitive. So that's okay, the point is that they can substitute in a sentence intransitive verb or transitive verb object grammatic How about erm God smiled upon John, God smiled upon someone? Er Meaning he was talented. Mm, yeah, good. I don't know, I'll think about it. Very good Well unfortunately if they're idioms, then they do. God smiled upon him, er idiom? It does seem to be doesn't it? Because if you substitute something into the God, it doesn't really work or smiled upon fortune smiled upon him. Fate smiled upon him. Yeah, it's not an idiom. Notice it really isn't smiled upon, smiled upon is one, is the idiom. so that's just a, a verb and then you can put, put in anything such that if such thing smiles upon you, you are blessed, God, destiny, fate, fortune. I'm sure there are things about Well there might be er and that's the trouble when one starts doing philosophy and there's real study of language, it gets really difficult. Erm okay, moving on to point six, and now we soon get a little bit fancy. This is more evidence for the claim that you get a verb phrase in a sentence erm, but it introduces, er it's also an example of how you can account for grammatical phenomena in terms of er structural relations in sentences and large expressions. So, point six erm okay look at the sentences one and two under six, one is apparently ill-formed, herself left, except in I think some Irish dialects actually yes, well it has a rather special meaning where herself is given special status erm in the context, but in normal English, English herself left is ill-formed, but two, Florence saw herself is fine herself is a reflective pronoun refers that herself each other or one another, the other are reflective pronouns. Erm and then if you move on to sentences four and five underneath them er anyone left is ill-formed, but no one saw anyone is fine. Still, ideas that the reflective pronoun herself and the item anyone which is called a negative polarity item, the item anyone needs to have something else in the sentence in order to license them they can't just occur freely in the normal position for er nouns, even though they are nouns. So Florence licenses herself and Florence herself and no one licenses anyone in anyone. Okay, but the item that licenses them the other licensing sentence you need in order to license these items, you can't just go anywhere in the sentence so sentence three, herself saw Florence is no good, even though Florence is there, it's in the wrong place relative to herself and similarly six, anyone saw no one is no good, even though no one is in the sentence. So what we need to do is you need to figure out what kind of items license erm reflects the pronouns like herself and make it a polarity items like anyone. What kind of items license them and where do they have to be in the sentence. Well the position the relative position is to find in terms of pre-structural notions. Erm, okay the notation for Flo Florence teased Dougal is it can be expressed, converted directly into the explicit tree notation on the handout. That just depicts the same structure in terms of constituents and sub-constituents, so the whole thing is a sentence which in the the private sector for profits. Placements, April to August a hundred and fifty nine in nursing homes, two hundred and eight in residential homes in all sectors. But, we know that April was a low figure, we also know that July and August are low a figure which comes out from this graph and was given to me by the director yesterday, is a genuine average which is turning out to be between a hundred and a hundred and ten placements per month twelve hundred to fourteen hundred placements per year a thr over a three year average residency period three thousand six hundred to four thousand two hundred placements in residential care, where then is the real problem. The problem is with the fact that seventy five to eighty percent of people are being directed towards the private sector and only twenty to twenty five percent towards the public sector, yet still the private sectors squeal. I've got here a copy of a letter by Peter spokesperson for care, a more misnamed organisation you couldn't wish to come across, a combined association of residential establishments. A letter to G P s. Dear doctor,we have noticed that as a result of a press article, copy enclosed, that there's been concern stressed by a number of general practitioners with regards the slowness of the social services controlled community care programme as an association on behalf of our residential and nursing home members we have been stating the same fact to social services who have basically denied the existence of any problem, although we hope that in the long term the social services will be able refine their system to be more efficient, as an interim measure we are offering you a direct line service. If you wish to effect a placement in a residential or nursing home we hope for the time being it will help resolve your problem. This is an attempt to circumvent the assessment process. They cannot of course do that, this letter described by the director of social services as a disgrace. No, people sitting across in the other benches saying of course they can are wrong. Of course they can't. People may put themselves into residential care if they wish they will pay the whole of the bill. If they wish to be assessed as needing residential care and using public money then they have to go through the assessment process and be assessed as needing residential care. So this letter which refers to our processes in this county council, it's talking about people who want to go into residential care and to use public money. All of that being said and Mr will talk a bit more about the figures when he comes to speak. People will no doubt be relieved to hear what has finally been included in the planning sub-committee resolutions. That homes already furbished or in the process of being refurbished or identified for refurbishment shall not be closed and will re-open as county council E P H s. That reassurance is essential to residents, staff and to the community. That's what they desperately want to hear. We have also decided that we will look again at the costs of refurbishment. That we will seek to refurbish the homes which will cost least to refurbish, first. That way we will achieve more in the period and for the money that is available. That will leave us, presumably at the end of this process with some of the worst homes, which we will then have to decide what to do about. So although the Labour group will be moving a reference back of this matter as an amendment. I have to say that our input into what is going on is still very strong. We are still attempting to persuade people that the figures they have been given or have invented are wrong and if we operate on the real figures there is no reason for mass closures of elderly persons homes and we are still attempting to make the refurbishment programme work as best we can to achieve the most we can in the shortest period and for the least money. Chairman I move formally. Seconder. Sec Right we have an amendment to be moved by Mr . I thought you would Chairman, take it later I see a lot of hands up on the other side. erm The reason why we moved the amendment on this is er Jim been and that has, we started to query the figures I didn't get involved in the all this week and th people like Jim , David loads of my attention and the whole er exercise was a fraud they're all bum figures and when I checked, the figures I have checked here are done by a senior officer when I showed 'im what stuff was being wrong. apartments and I couldn't believe how they they there there could work up such a system and I'm serious, I I really mean this Mr Chairman, it is serious. Now what you were doing was, you got the top figure of available beds and you this time, I'm only going for the this paper that is shown to me a an an an and produced some place in in your apartments and it says here, partly vacancies weekend in the first of August. I was surprised when I found out who the officer, a very capable officers what's done the figures. But then I was reminded how I thought of a an accountant who was at work what figure was five and five and he said what figures did you have in mind. So what has happened here I believe, that there was someone told, I don't know who it was was told this is the figure, now you you you're . I will say that because as, we haven't heard the end by a long way for, of this one. Jim pointed out that and when I looked at, in the report here, page fifteen, two of your paper and there it says in little letters B, little little two appendix B a during the year, a three year period from June ninety three to October ninety six, the level of occupancy the department's afford. Vacancies who arise from five seventeen,had a figure of five seventeen, when I looked at this now, how could y , where did they get the figures from this . Didn't that someone to do the the the homework for them. So you did, right at the top one as I said two thousand four three four and then the closure of Coulson House in it. Well I hope there's nobody in Coulson House because it's boarded up and I cannot see how you get a vacant bed in Coulson House and this is this exercise. So we take that away and then you got the refurbishment programme and now taken away from the refurbishment programme something like two hundred, now where is the if you're refurbishing four homes where is the vacancies when you close the home, you have made the staff the redundant, they go up the road or out wherever they're going to redundancy persons. You have made 'em red, you have made 'em redundant and you in, in you have and I hope you've had nobody redundant because I've I'd be pleased to go out to those homes and say them come back and I would be pleased to go up to and say you've got your figures wrong because you're saying that nobody's made redundant ooh well I I'm so pleased. I hope I've been given I hope I be the temporary staff but,those homes are being refurbished, there are no vacant beds in those homes because they are being refurbished. You are carrying that number forward. Now if you have a rolling programme and you wanna say we refurbish four at a time, roughly I would say fifty beds in these two hundred, give or take some money because they vary. That's taken out, must be taken out of the calculation because they're not vacant, you can't get anybody in there, the criteria I say, should be beds available for permanent occupation. Now you count on that but the next vote then comes in and they're still not available beds are not available in it, and the next four and the next four so you'll have, for years you'll have those out of operation would you like to call it that way and out of production. Now to weight that and the next one is respite an short stay beds as you mentioned. Now if you any system you got to have beds for short stay etcetera, you don't count them into whether the those are vacant, because you have to keep some of those vacant in emergencies etcetera so you can't count them. Well, this is how you got the figures and then you have the temporary absence as Jim pointed out and advance bookings. I got a higher figure than Jim because I was I can't believe, believe this either th th the officer that, that, that, done this say to the, the, that's the figures that have produced then they're completely wrong and I can tell Time time time Time, right, I am moving the amendment the reference back and I'm handing those papers to the Chief Executive and I'm gonna ask the Chief Executive to get someone independent to do this because you can't get away from the numbers that the numbers I've get someone independent I'll ask for that. You can't get away with a with a fraud like this. You can't away with er some bum figures like this one, it's not good enough for the members to give, be given wrong information and I and I can tell you this we'll be coming back again and then we would know and where they were getting where they were getting the seventeen homes Time Closed right down no is a load of bloody bunkum the whole I move Have we a seconder? Have Mr Thank you Mr Chairman. For Mr information the vacancies are the difference between the number of beds we maintain and the number of residence we have. Every bed in that difference has to be paid for with wasted money but in addition the loss of income from that bed has to be found from cuts elsewhere in social services. I frankly can't deal in the time allowed with what Mr said, I have never heard so many inaccuracies and misconceptions in a speech, it was the most comprehensive political suicide speech I've heard yet in this council. The truth is Mr Chairman that community care had as it's major objective extending choice, give the chance to stay at home to many people for as long as possible, to eliminated the unwanted percentage of residential placements. What it's revealed, totally unexpectedly is the vast extent to which inappropriate placements have taken place for many years. Totally unexpected because frankly no government, no civil service would have given us as much money for residential places as they did if they'd known. The knumdrum where the people have gone has now been answered because the amount of domiciliary care needed to keep them out of residential places to meet their needs and wishes turns out to be very much less than we expected, on average less than seven hours a week. This report Mr Chairman is already history which is as Mr has said not to say it doesn't represent progress, it addresses for the first time the historical issues, it starts to address the lessons of the first quarter. We now know the outcome of the second quarter ignoring today and tomorrow which can bring, can make no major change in the scale of what we face. Leaving the rest of community care aside, the admissions to our part three E P H s were thirteen in July, twelve in August and in the first twenty eight days of September, just four. That's less than one placement for every ten homes over the quarter, an average of less than ten in total per month. We must now fear with good reason that it was the first three months which were not typical. Late last year I was accused of scaremongering, dismissive speakers rubbished the remarks of the district auditor, not interested in what he was saying. The only thing I could be safely accused of was understating the problem. I still commend this report to council as the first real stride along the road we have to take, there's no choice about that. This stride and those that have followed last week, as recently as last week as Mr said are already miles back along that road. The s the revolution of social services called for a rolling programme and a rolling review and the amendment Mr is utterly meaningless because the matter will be constantly referred back and further considered by social services whatever the amendment says that's what the original resolution said. It contains a rolling review precisely so that it should remain a valid basis for whatever tomorrow may bring. In truth the rolling review has become a running review circumstances are changing with no respect for the committee cycle. Indeed some of us think we now know what bankers in the republic felt like, if you stand up to make a speech the matter has moved on before you sit down again but I must tell you of the next major problem. Flowing from that that which social service must face urgently and that is this. From the low admission rate, the nine hundred thousand in our revenue budget which was shown this year as savings, seven hundred thousand of which was met by fudging community care money in June is now short by three hundred thousand so at the end of this year there will be an overspend or rather a loss of income of three hundred thousand which will show up as a deficit on social services budget for this year. Next year the full year effect of the revenue budget one point five five million, already two hundred thousand short, the estimated loss of income from reduced placements will now put another eight hundred thousand on that er, so there will be a million next year, so I have to tell you there is a gap of one point three million pounds in the social services budget which we have not yet faced. Mr Chairman the social services committee and it's sub- committees face many more agonizing d decisions. Nobody wants to close any bed that is offering a good quality service, that is wanted and being used. No one can afford to keep open beds that are not being used, not just losing savings but soaking up resources that can only come from cuts in other vital social services. The social service of this council. You're on time. Are controlled and driven by events not by any one party or any parties. For the sake of our service and their users we must ensure we are not overrun by those events. Thank you Mr The support of the whole council now would recognise Thank you Mr and gratefully aid that work. Mr please. Chairman, I must confess to being erm, to being somewhat pessimistic about this whole er this this whole problem of of the need to refurbish and the need to tackle numbers in our elderly persons homes. I I listened to Mr speech with some incredulity I must say, but I did listen to what he said and if what he said is true then I I find some of the things disturbing and and er I'd like to see his figures and I I w I I that there have certainly been er two messages coming to the social services committee in in in that case. I'm pessimistic because I believe that if the council is to tackle what I still believe to be a big problem of the local authority then it cannot really do so without the support of the largest party on this authority and if we have heard erm an honest assessment of their perception of of the case, I I really I really do despair that this council will will get to the bottom of the problem. Er, we were told by Mr that there is no problem with numbers, remember there are two, there are two things we've got to tackle, one is numbers, two is conditions in our home. I mean, one's, one's entitled to ask I think if there is no problem, if we only have vacancies of two or three in our elderly persons homes throughout the county wh erm why on earth did the director of the social serv , did the director of social services and his deputy at the meeting on the twenty fifth of August of the social services committee, say that this was the greatest problem which was facing this council. Why on earth eighteen months ago did the district auditor issue a letter saying that unless the council did something about the situation of numbers and of finance within its elderly persons homes then it would come in and it would require the council to take action. Why on earth on the twenty fifth of August at the social services committee meeting did Labour put an amendment which accepted that there was a vacancy problem I quote from the Labourer, from from Labour amendment that er we don't agree to closures, fair enough, that's your position. But that that we ask for an exploration of the feasibility of widening the use of homes into nursing care, very sheltered accommodation, apartment style accommodation etcetera. Now if there is no problem why on earth do we have to put that sort of that sort of work by officers erm, in, in to action erm, so between the, if I understand Labour's position now Chairman, between the twenty fifth of August and the twenty eighth of September, we have now gone from accepting the problem and seeing how we can solve a number problem to saying that there is no no number problem and that everyone is cooking the books. I find that quite incredible, if it's true erm if it's true then it's a very serious allegation which Labour is making against the officers in social services department and I imagine that if er, that if those numbers are proven then er I I shall be looking I shall be looking for scalps because I have been, I would have been, so would the Liberal party and so would the Labour party, have been wrongly informed. I don't believe we have been wrongly informed but that's the logic of the charge which has been made. I I simply, I simply want er er a direct message from from the programme which is going on Chairman incidentally I I note that Nottinghamshire County Council erm has found a a and the Labour group there has found it necessary to tackle just the same problems erm in elderly persons homes and that I understand that they have a a closure list of seven, now presumably that has been drawn up from a long list of a lot more than seven, say fourteen or fifteen from which they've made their final choice. I think we're entitled to ask if Nottinghamshire faces those problems, what is peculiar about Leicestershire that it did face those problems but all of a sudden it doesn't face those problems. I I don't think myself and I still have an open mind and I don't think that the Labour case erm adds up to be perfectly honest. I simply wanna say two things and that is this that within a month if this scheme is to work I believe that the council or the social services committee must draw up a long list of homes which it proposes to close and that long list will be in teams and that must be done not behind closed doors so that people know what is being proposed, we level with people who live in those institutions and they are fully acquainted with our, with our intentions and secondly I think it's necessary to understand from this programme that it is not just refurbishment programme, it is a refurbishment and closure programme the simple equation being that the money that comes from closures from capital receipts and some revenue savings, actually goes into the rest to refurbish them. That is the scheme er as as I see it and unless, unless I I thi , unless that is progressed quickly then as I say I am extremely pessimistic and let me just say Chairman the dangers of not going along that line the dangers of the present scheme which was at the last planning committee meeting or or or was it one of the social services committee anyway, where four were chosen or or it was said choose a small number. That I think is half a programme and while that might erm while that might appeal to er members of the Liberal party, half a cake's better than none. What I think the danger is there, from a Conservative political perspective, is that having, having, Liberals having with us if you like, got the principle through, Liberals may then go with the Labour party and say right we've got the principle through, we've identified four homes, let's have a refurbishment programme, a bit of airport money here, a bit of slippage there and we'll get this through and then we'll tackle the problem of closures and if closures is proving difficult let's ignore it for a year, let's do these four and let's go on. I would not recommend to this side that they have any truck with that particular perspective. Here, here. Erm, that is why I I b , that is why I'm against the amendment, I believe that decisions have been made. I still n , I still think that we need to make er quick pro progress Chairman but er unless we do make quick progress and unless we do understand what's going on and call a spade a spade then I think this programme is doomed. Thank you. Mrs Thank you Chair. Mr asked why we should close our homes and let private homes profit erm, if people choose either to go into the private sector or to stay into their own homes, what are we supposed to do tell them they've got no choice but to keep our substandard homes going? That's quite ridiculous. He says seventy to seventy five percent are being directed towards the private sector so why. I thought our social services people did that if they run that why should they direct people away from their own livelihoods. That's quite ludicrous, why should they shoot themselves in the foot and is Mr seriously suggesting the same thing? I mean apart from a monstrous attack on our own officers who can't answer for themselves in this place. Why should they be prejudicing the the jobs of the their colleagues, I, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Now I think the tables speak for themselves and they're born out by paragraph sixteen B of the report on page fifty nine. I just wonder when Mr asks for other figures from the independent sector what would have happened if the figures that you've got before you today had actually come from the private sector. I suspect he would have been making exactly the same speech but saying that the figures were suspect because they had been come from somewhere else. Thank you. Mrs Thank you Chairman. I re do regret that this has come to full council yet again because I thought we'd already had the debate. At the social services planning committee we stated that we were anxious to make a fresh start in addressing the problems of our elderly persons homes. In the end Chairman,we did reach consensus and I find no difficulty with that. But our original vision had almost been lost in the unclean political battles which have taken place. I re-read the speech that I gave in this full council chamber on November the twentieth nineteen ninety one nothing has changed except possibly it has got worse. What has changed though is the refurbishment programme and I'm not quite sure what Mr was on about about er er the refurbishment programme. The officers advised us that we could deal with four homes a year. So that's why we said well let's get on and decide which of the next four homes to be refurbished. So as that we could have the rolling programme. No one should ever underestimate the trauma of change on res on residents their relatives and the staff involved, either in the refurbishment programme or in future closers and we have never denied that there will not be closures, we have consistently proposed that there should be. It's unfortunate that yet again the Mercury got it wrong they stated that we had made a decision to close four homes unnamed that is not true and I do agree with Mr that when we make a decision to close some homes that they should be named to avoid the terrible indecision which exists at the moment. I'm sorry Mr has referred to closures in their teens cos this again throws residents and staff into total confusion we're too early in the programme of community care to know how many homes are going to close. We do know that two or three or four may have to in the foreseeable future. But without rationalisation Chairman we will not be able to extend those services that we all know that we want to assist people to stay in their own homes. We've argued for years about meals on wheel service that there should be seven day a week service throughout this authority, we've only got it in the City, we want it throughout the authority. We will not be able to supply an adequate home care service without the release of the resources that are tied up in our elderly persons homes. We shall not be able to produce ethnically appropriate services without the necessary finance and nor will we be able to develop new services which are innovative to assist people to stay in their own homes and I'm just going to take one moment to mention one or two Chairman. Why can't you have a flying warden service if you stay in your own home like in warden assisted accommodation. I'd love to see a service where somebody could come and knock on your door in the morning and say are you alright and call again in the evening, just as if you were in warden assisted accommodation. If we have a night sitting service, an elderly person may not have to go in hospital if they are temporarily gone off their legs as sometimes happens. After tiny U-turns Chairman two by the Tories and one by the Labour group, I do hope that finally we're going to make progress tonight. Thank you. Professor . I was only going to say Chairman I wish people wouldn't band the figures around the council chamber which nobody has seen before therefore can't assess. The issue here is quite simple, Labour have consistently turned their back on any closures, that's fair enough, so you wouldn't expect them then to produce figures which demonstrate that they're right. The Conservatives have now the Conservatives have now decided that home closure is the thing and you'd expect them to produce figures to say we've got to have thirteen or whatever number closed. What the, I believe committees have never had and least of all Mr papers produced on behalf of Mr have never had a serious rigorous objective assessment of the vacancy situation of the future which first of all starts from issue a rolling programme of refurbishments that we haven't really seen sight of the of the implications of that on the number of vacancies. This has never had it so this as far as I'm concerned really, the only thing that is needs to be made clear, is that we must accept of principle that's all we need to reason. Mr . Chairman I think this is probably the first time in this council chamber in twenty years that er I will probably have spoken on er social services issues er and I speak from an entirely private capacity and any information that er that comes my way is from what I might call informed members of the public erm, people who I come into contact with and from my own experiences as a ward councillor and from as we all do from time to time, my own family experience, my own domestic experiences and I do know something about the problems which are associated with the the care of elderly people er although I don't have that problem now erm things have taken their course. Er, Professor is right erm there may always be a possibility that at some time er you have to you have to recognise that there may be excess capacity in the system and I I don't believe that the Labour party is not prepared to recognise that there may well be excess capacity in the system at some time. S what in fact er Mrs said is too early in the process of community care to know how many homes you have to close she really is approaching it from the wrong way, it's equally too early in the process of community care to know how many homes you need to have open, keep open or open and that is one of the problems which I believe this council and other councils will will face. Now from my observations of these debates I've not heard anybody on this council saying council debates that there is no role for this local authority or any other local authority there is no role for them in the provision of residential care or any extension of residential care because some of our residential care is getting very, very close to providing a degree of nursing care. Nobody stands up and says that we shouldn't be in the business at all, we should get rid of all of them, so all the argument about how many. Every group in this council and I believe every member who speaks, agrees that we have a need to refurbish homes. So those are the positive things about which we we all agree. Now I would urge this council that it really is too early in the process for you to start making up your minds about what you're gonna in future. You simply do not have enough data. There is a perception amongst informed people in the community that there may well be a shortage of long stay beds in Leicestershire and you do need to bear in mind that the National Health Service is increasingly going down the road of not keeping people in hospitals longer than they have to because hospitals are perceived as being very, a very expensive way of providing beds and you have to take that into account because that's a fairly clear national policy and you are likely to see an acceleration in that process from what I read in the national press. There's also a general view in the community that community care itself is not necessarily really working very well, there's some fears about it, some uncertainties and a member did mention, it may have been Jim you know or somebody mentioned about the seven hours domiciliary, from my experience as a councillor I am not sure that simply because that figure exists that that means that that is satisfying the need of those people and in any case the sort of people who need to go into residential care, who can no longer be maintained in their home, with whatever help we give them or with whatever help their family have to give them they're not necessarily the sort of people who we're talking about need to go in a home. You must always remember that it's been a fairly small percentage of the frail elderly people who've actually ever had to go into homes. Most of the people in some way or other, have been looked after by somebody else and that's the experience which I I've certainly gone through and if in fact you start making up your mind too early about which homes you're going to Near time close, I can assure you Chairman recognise the time, I can assure you Chairman that our social workers when doing assessments will not, because I've had this from them, at grass roots level in a branch local party meeting,that our social workers will not indicate to those people who they've assessed that there are vacancies in those homes. They steer people away from any home which they believe is likely to be closed and once you start doing this, you will in fact be sealing the fate of those homes and you it's a very, very dangerous game, you've gotta be, you've gotta play it very, very carefully indeed and I hope Chairman that there can be a degree of common sense and rationality introduced into discussions between the members of the various groups who have to deal with these very difficult issues. Thank you. Mr Thank you Mr Chairman. Well I believe that the report that er is before us that has been moved erm actually sets out a framework which the social service committee is able to work to and to monitor and I see no point whatsoever in referring this back to social services erm to delay further what is the inevitable. The figures that have been mentioned er and the danger with figures that are mentioned is that they can't be everything to everybody. Now eighteen months ago we had three hundred and, it was April, the report in April nineteen ninety two there were three hundred and sixty five I think it was places that were vacant in our homes and this is before we started the refurbishment. Now if Jim is telling us that there are four hundred and ten vacancies now and he's explained where those four hundred and ten vacancies are we've picked up another fifty p places within that eighteen months. So we do have a problem to address but the I I like Mr would certainly want some explanation from the director of social services if erm the report that we have before us at the planning sub-committee is incorrect because I deal with it said it it be noted that the capacity now exists to arrange for the transfer of residents from four homes to other res residential units as part of the rationalisation programme. Not part of the refurbishment programme, not the difference. So we do have a problem and and we need to grasp that the a conclusion talking about rolling programme we are concerned about resources we're, we're, we're concerned about using them to the best advantage. We set up to be able to look at the refurbishment of our homes. Now if we are going to say that this rolling programme, we we don't mean this rolling programme because it it's all going back to committees again to be to be looked at then we are putting our at a disadvantage they will disband and the cost to us for refurbishment will increase. It's essential that in the terms of the er report from the social service committee that we work, we work to the framework within that report. We have the ability to monitor it and I think that the discussions will have to take place as the director brings forward his proposals. There is a great deal within that framework er, it's not just about closing elderly persons homes, it's not just about refurbishment it's about resources and it's resources that we're very short of, to implement the sort of care programme that this council should be addressing. Thank you. Er, Mr Thank you Mr Chairman. As I, as I said earlier the new boy, the rather elderly new boy but I can assure the Professor if I were a hundred years old I'd still be younger than 'im. That's how I look at life. Now I I wondered whether you'd ever get it or not, come on quick quick. Now what we'll be Mr Chairman is this. This has been hanging about for a long, long time while I've been on this and these people and they're very special people I've got this sword of hanging over my head. Now these, why do I call these special people, for the first thing we're just coming out of a recession they s With three million unemployed These people suffered the depression and if you saw deprivation that was deprivation. There were no giros in them days. I beg your pardon. Now they went into war, they came out of this war the weren't, there was no tip of the glory for them. There was fourteen feet of snow floods but the main thing about these people, they took their jackets off and got stuck in and they became special people because they laid the foundation of the welfare state that everybody else in this room g gained out of. They got the jackets off, they did the job, they laid it out for us. Now surely we owe these people something better than this surely there's got the wickedness out or the intelligence to get this thing off the ground. If we've got to close homes, let's close them but make sure the homes that's left are warm welcoming and give these people the dignity and the independence to which they are entitled to which they've earned and which they thoroughly deserve. Here, here. Thank you. Mr do you want to speak or reserve your remark. Yeah, I think some of the new members should wait to speak Chair. Chair, sorry right, I I've I I've don't very often. It's gone, it's gone I don't very often agree with Professor erm I very often don't agree with David either but I've got to admit that I agree with both of them today, we've got to make haste slowly on this one. It's alright us starting to go along the road of closures, but some of us have been here through it a lot, little bit longer than others and I think we have got to watch what we're doing. We don't know what the capacity is gonna be needed in the future. If the government gets its way and starts slapping seventeen and a half percent, twenty percent V A T on fuel, we might need some more residential places you don't know. If the figures that we've been given the recent figures, cos w I've been working on figures for August up to August but now we've got even better figures. If these figures are right that we've been given by the department and I'm not saying them whether they're right or whether they're wrong but well we have to r rely on what we're getting this is why Mr is sending this lot to the Chief Executive for him to do some work I think it's very important that it is done independently, not by the independent sector but by done independently. If those figures are right of four hundred and ten now you don't need to be a real big mathematician, even at this time of night,but you, if you have the two hundred and thirty four out of commission and you've got to have those cos that's gotta be a rolling programme each four years. You're gonna have that two hundred odd there rolling over, it's gotta happen until the end of the programme and that is likely to take six, seven, eight years. You're way about half a century. That might be the simplest way and if you add that to the seventy two that are out of commission short term beds, holiday beds, which you've got to keep empty anyway. You've got your three hundred and six. Now we've been told by, in reports that we've got five, six hundred up to ni , we're gonna have nine hundred vacancies this is Mr at committee I said that unclear Can we, can we come through the Chair I think it's, it's very interesting that erm the these figures are there. Now if we're gonna have those sort of figures we're talking about. What are we basing them on? I want to see, I'm I mean I saw Mr and erm Mr nodding when Martin said he wanted to give these figures to the Chief Exec and ask him to er get it sorted out. I think that's right so, we we mustn't even start even thinking about closing beds at the moment. If we've only got two or three in each home empty, where are the people going to? I've checked with Demontfort House today. Ear early before I came over here and they've got no vacancies none none at Demontfort House at all. We're told, we're told though in the report for Au for August that we've got so many vacancies here, if we look at Nuffield House in the August report there was fourteen, but we're only just refilling it again after closing it. We're only just refilling it. Now I don't know where Mr has got some of his figures from but I think we ought to check both our figures and his figures before we start jumping to Not my figures please . Erm Mr Chairman on a point of information, the figures he has obtained on my figures are figures in a report issued by the director of social services and I think on a point of information he should acknowledge that they are the figures given by the officers. Thank you. They were not supplied And orders from you, yep. Now we must keep we must keep be I know people and I'm sure every member in this council chamber knows people that need respite care. If you don't you're not wal you're walking around with your eyes closed. I certainly do in my patch. There are people that we are redirecting, we were re redirecting from Demontfort House at one time, it was denied denied by by officers that it was happening. Denied by Mrs she had a letter. But you ask the people that work there, you ask social workers . That place was gradually being run down like a lot of the other are. David, near time. As far as the Nottinghamshire erm thing the reason Notts are having to close it is because the they've been capped haven't they and they've gotta save money. Now I think this is what's behind all this actually. Not to do with looking after people at all. It's to start saving money and give some and give some of this money to their private sector friends. Once again this is what's happened. Thank you David, thank you. So Chair, I will second these resolut , the the amendment. Mr Yes, thank you Chair, erm A lot of this debate circles around what we do about community care, I have to tell this council as far as I'm concerned, community care's dead in the water. Without massive input from central government and local government there is no community care there are people out there not receiving the services they deserve With no prospect of receiving the services they deserve. Let's not pretend that we can escape from our responsibility to these old people by pretending that the community will take care of them, that's not the way it's gonna be. er Mr talked about the figures, I'm convinced that the figures that, that I was given still include Perzon House I'm convinced that those figures were not, have not been taken out erm I don't know who should audit the figures, perhaps the internal audit should audit the figures. Yes, Yes, here, here. Mr was completely wrong about the Labour amendment erm in fact he read out the wrong amendment altogether. The Labour amendment was to explore ways in which resources can be provided to fund and enhance refurbishment programme without closures and that for the next two years the additional necessary funding be sourced from housing benefit income and income from the sale of East Midlands Airport and from other capital receipts. Now if the Labour group had moved a widening of erm the sort of provision in our elderly persons homes, I could have understood that, because we didn't have real figures, we could not get hold of real figures, every time I went back to a local party meeting, to the Labour group, to any other member they said, do you realise this home has this number of vacancies and your report says that number. Do you realise that the figures are out that everybody knows that the figures are out. Is Mr and is er capacity for understatement. His desire to devastate our residential sector and close seventeen homes will be thwarted somebody over there, it may have been Mr it may not have been, said that there hadn't been any redundancies. Arbour House twenty four staff, twelve redundancies, twelve redeployed. Huntingdon Court twenty nine staff, ten redundancies, seventeen redeployed, two still in temporary posts. The Limes,provisional figures twenty nine ninety three, closing during October, thirty four staff, sixteen redundancies, fifteen redeployed, two ill health retirements, one retirement. Bythorpe Hall twenty one redundancies, six lay off agreements, two redeployed, one temporary for a year, one on trial period two to three months. Kurzon House twenty eight staff, seventeen redundancies of which two re since redeployed ten redeployed, one ill health retirement, of course there are no redundancies. We've not made anyone redundant, no one at all. That Labour amendment I read out mentioned the airport money. I'm aware as everybody else is, that we could do the sort of sweepstake that we carry out on th , what time the meeting's gonna close and everybody can just put down how many times the the airport money had been spent. But the real fact is if this council regards elderly persons homes as the priority it pretends then it has to be the first priority for that money. It doesn't have to stand in line behind anything else. About er refurbishment and closure programme Mr talked about, a a refurbishment and closure programme is a Tory programme, not a Labour programme and of course this is all verified by Mrs coming along to the committee and saying please don't close Barleythorpe Hall, please tell the people that you're going to re-open Barleythorpe Hall, please do not allow them to think that it's going to close. Has anyone seen Barleythorpe Hall? Does anyone know what needs to be done there, what the work is and how much it is gonna cost, I'm sure Mrs seen it. So why are social workers directed people into the private sector, they are under the same constant pressure of letters from the private sector, the wingeing, the groaning, the moaning, the threats of legal action, the threats of judicial review as the rest of us. Hardly surprising that they over compensate is it put people into the private sector. I didn't understand her questions was it the figures had come from the private sector I'm not sure if she understood it herself either erm we've talked in the social services planning cuts committee about a list of homes for refurbishment and Mr wanted a very long list er a list which would blight every home not on the list. Mrs talked about four, we've actually agreed that there should be more homes on the list than four er for prospective refurbishment and Mr has stood up and protested that he did not produce the figures, but Professor still says you will produce figures for this and you will produce figures for that, none of us do that we all get our figures from the same place but we all get inconsistent figures. erm, Mr knows when he talked about getting rid of all the a ho , our homes that of course, we're not allowed to get rid of all of our homes, if we were the Tories would have moved it years ago. But what does happen is that people are directed away from blighted homes we know that that happens, it happens all the time, as soon as a home's name is mentioned social workers, quite honourably believe that there's no sense in putting down people's names, no no sense in sending people there and you would expect nothing different from them so it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. The point to Mr , the point of the reference back is simply to allow us to say that we do not accept the figures that we're being presented with. We will not accept those figures because they are not correct. Everybody agrees now that the figures before us are not correct as everybody produces a different set er, it's alright for Mr to sit there and Mr like Heckyl and Jeckyl saying no we don't, no we don't, but he comes forward with different figures, worst figures than we're presented with in the reports, he does it all the time Chairman. As for Mr we're out of recession are we?well if that's an excuse for saying let's close homes well, I think that's a a terrible shame, all he, the certainty that he wants to offer to our elderly people is the certainty that their home will close and they'll be thrown out of it. People really do have to understand the trauma we are talking about with moving people out of homes, the trauma that moving them out for refurbishment is bad enough. But telling them that they will not move back is even worse. We really do have to put a human face onto these figures and these financial arguments, until we do that, we will not carry any decision in this council chamber which is worth a light to any single elderly person in any of our homes or outside of our homes Chairman. I recommend to you the amendment. Right, we now put the amendment. Those in favour please show. Right, we're just going to count. right, those against the amendment is lost, thirty six forty, er those in favour of the substantive motion please say aye. Aye. Those against. No. The ayes have it. We will now have a fifteen minute recess. Six D the report of public protection committee. Yes, I've just counted them, Robert counts as two, Bob that's important you see right . That's promotion in the Labour rank would you like to move the motion please Mr . Would you prepare to move the motion please. Yes, sorry Mr Chairman erm I move, what'm I doing? I move in the er public protection report that er Mr Chairman, the bell's still going do you want me to hang on a minute or what? No carry on, I, the first bell there they should have been in. Carry on. But people are gonna miss my blooming speech they'll miss it. I know you spent hours, I know you spent hours preparing this speech. I haven't actually. The important ones are here, proceed please. I've prepared the amendment in the in in removing the port er Mr Chairman I think it's erm important to note the reason why the public protection committee have asked the report to be put onto the council agenda. Not simply because we also want to put our bid in straightaway for the airport money which is er contrary to opinion had been noted. but to highlight to members of the council the importance of having the proper funding er er for the southern fire station. The reasons for the southern fire station are clearly outlined on page seventy and seventy one which is an extract from her Majesty's fire service inspectorate. In particular item eleven point three of that where the H M I said sufficient capital should be provided to enable the provision of the southern fire station to go ahead. There is a large area of new build around where the southern fire station will be and I do say will be because it will be. That sounded, that sounded er, sounded quite good A promise and er one of the im important things er is that the Chief Fire Officer is currently away in Glasgow at the Fire Service conference, as you're well aware. But I spoke with Mr about half an hour ago on the telephone, told him not to worry at all, that that's confidence. This evening Bob will be changing his amendment to read the funds will be provided rather than consideration. And the Chief said that doesn't compare he said that does not concur with a visit I had last night in Glasgow whilst asleep when he awoke to a gleaming light at his bedroom and he said who are you and this figure said I am God and the Chief Fire Officer said well God, all I want to know is one thing, will I get my southern fire station? And God said not in my lifetime. Cos I've since spoke to God Mr Chairman. and he is, as you do, as you do, and he assures me that er we will get the fire station. I don't wish to underestimate it the, our attendance times around the Meridian Park area, the large new build area Mr Chairman erm, our attendance times there are shocking to say the least. No fault of our brigade at all, there's a desperate need for the southern fire station to go ahead without any doubt whatsoever, lives are at risk and the longer we leave this the more the costs will keep increasing and er I I believe that the airport money should be used to build Another one now, it's all gone now Owen, it's not spent yet. Trust me. Trust me I said not truss me, trust me. We have one of the best fire services and the best brigades in this country Mr Chairman and you none the least Mr Chairman on some of you recent visits and meeting some of our fire personnel are more than aware we are the the best equipped, the cheapest brigade and our chaps and girls in Leicestershire, the morale is very high, regardless of what's going on around the pay dispute at the moment and I think that we need to show our support to those fire personnel and provide the adequate funding for the southern fire station. I'm assured by Tommy that after I open the Saw Valley Way er traffic jam on November the third, you you'll get a slight better erm, slightly better chance traffic through, er. Have we a seconder? Have you reserved any remarks, you want er Mrs do you wish to speak? I sorry, sorry. We'll have the amendment first shall we? Yes, let's have the amendment. We have an amendment by Mr . I only did that just to test to see if you were awake. I think er in an effort to accommodate Mr Chairman, the members here this evening, it's been quite a long day, the the Conservative amendment is very close to the amendment that both er myself and Mr have put in and yes we would be willing to accept that, I think we've got the point across which the only thing missing from the Conservative amendment is the thing about the airport money. I think I've made that point Will you accept this subject in the raffle? Chairman all I've heard so far is music to my ears er thank you. I'd like to er say one or two words before er moving the amendment and I, I'm very pleased to to hear that the two are to be incorporated as it were into this one. Members of the public protection committee take due note of the contents of Her Majesty's Inspector's current report, but in particular we take note of his concerns that the standard of fire cover in an area to the South West of the city is inadequate. He's repeated his concern to us regularly for eight years eight years. I've no difficulty in seeing why he's concerned er because I've seen the figures and examine the situation in in great detail. But even without the figures it takes very little imagination to see why this council must not put off any longer the construction and commissioning of the southern fire station. Imagine with me Chairman if you will the thoughts of someone trapped by some misfortune in the midst of the wreckage of a road traffic accident on the M 1 motorway Southbound between junctions twenty one and twenty that's at Nutterworth or Northbound between twenty one and twenty two or Westbound on the M 69 they'll be thinking the fire brigade'll be here in a minute or two. Certainly the first appliance will arrive but on the opposite carriageway because it's coming from Nutterworth or Hinkley or Colvill severely hampering what that appliance crew can do speedily. It's unlikely that they will imagine that the most helpful appliance is most likely to be one of three, battling to get through the traffic from new parts of Leicester, Lancaster Place Leicester and Wigstone. Three because the Chief Fire Officer cannot guarantee any longer er that if he only despatched the one which is necessary, it would actually get through the traffic. Similarly in the vast residential and commercial areas of Enderby, Norborough, Homkirk, Cosby, Watchton Croft, parts of Broadstone and Meridian itself the delays have become unacceptable. This area is the furthest such populated area from a fire station in the county. I have witnessed myself the effects of the delays on a number of occasions. Within the past year a small fire in a large Victorian house only fifty yards from my workplace watching helplessly while the building became engulfed before the brigade arrived from Leicester and Wigstone, five and six miles distance distant. Minutes matter, we all know this because of regular news reports, videos and demonstrations to the committee. I know because many years ago I happened to be in the right place, in the ambulance I was driving at the right time and was able to e effect a rescue of an old woman from her smoke filled house at Burstill Ten minutes later I could not have done it because of the smoke. The fire brigade arriving five minutes later might have done it, ten minutes, definitely not. The Chief Fire Officer advises us that the attendance times to the areas I have mentioned are regularly over the response times allowed by the standards of fire cover. He tells me that attendances between three and five minutes, over the ten minutes allowed are common. Five, six, seven, eight minutes are understandable and acceptable lives are regularly saved in that time. More than the ten minutes allowed is no longer remember I was only a little boy I mean I can remember all this, I took it all in but I wouldn't say that I knew them er I knew Miss , from the grocer's shop she was a Sunday School teacher, and er the Sunday School used to be at Road School we used to have a Sunday School there and a Mr used to take this. He was another character er there was er I remember they used to have a lot of socials and things at the church you know, it was very well attended I suppose in those days. Don't know what it's like now. What about the Conservative Club and the Liberal Club did they, were they more social clubs? Oh yes, er yes they were, they were er of course there was a great divide there I mean between the Liberals I mean they were the only two parties in those days. The Conservative Club was there before the, the Liberal Club. I think if the Liberal Club was only like First World War it wasn't there it hasn't always been there but the Conservative Club was there as long as I can remember. Do you recall any of the activities that were associated with either of them? Did what? Do you recall any of the activities that were associated? Well I was in the tennis club when I was a er they used to have a tennis court at the back. Which club was that? Conservative Club, and my wife she wa we were both members there oh and there was a, I tell you another shop that probably I haven't mentioned, just before you get to the White Hart there was Thompsons the butcher's shop with er they got three or four er daughters I remember. Why do you think there were so many butcher's shops? there was a lot of meat I suppose really I mean erm answer. I mean were there sort of different quality meats being sold all the rest were No difference No of course one or two of them had slaughter houses at the back of them you know. I see I mean er Which were those? Well Tommy used to slaughter all his cattle and er you see my father-in-law's bakehouse and his slaughter house were next to one another an open yard at the back of the shops and er How did the cattle arrive? Oh driven up from the station from the, from the goods yard oh yes. Was that in Street Walsall or ? Yes a long street or somewhere around there, and yes I mean many oh many a time I've, you'd see ca every Wednesday night you'd see the cattle being driven up. Always the same night was it? Yeah, and one got stuck in the, there was an entry between my father-in-law's shop and the next one and one of these cattle ran down the entry and got stuck in the entry, you know it was only narrow and the they had to shoot it, but er oh yes it was a, that was a thing you never hear of today and you never hear of people putting tannin down when people are ill do you? You see Walsall being a leather town there was a lot of this er bark tannin as went and when anyone who was ill so they wouldn't hear the noises of the horse driven vehicles going by they used to, for about fifty yards each side of the house they used to put this stuff in the road to deaden the sound. Do you recall this being done? Oh yes. And what, where did this happen that you remember? Oh I've known it happen all over Caldmore. So it was a regular happening? Oh yes they put this, this tannin down it was like a bark I don't know what it was cos I'm not in the leather trade, I, I don't know much about it except that it was some by-product from the of the er tanning process, and they used to put this stuff down when people were ill. So with you mentioning leather then it leads me onto another question erm was there much done in the way of leather work in the Caldmore area? Oh rather yes, out-work, people used during the First World War there were no end of people were sort of er especially if they'd had a bit of experience in the leather industry like harness and saddlery and that sort of thing, especially the harness and er other work attached to leather cavalry and er revolver holsters and that sort of thing, they'd do them at home you know oh yes there was er now Walsall's divided isn't it? It's got leather and, and iron and steel, now you come onto the Road and you wouldn't think there a leather factory about would you? Because from top to bottom it was all connected with iron and steel the whole lot all the way down. You go from er Hopeworths, Mason and Burnhams, John , Gill and Russells, Walker Brothers it was er a terribly industrial, well you could fi Road used to be all granite sets in the road, there wasn't the, because there was so much traffic went up and down er it was all made of granite sets when I, when I was a kid, but my, shall I tell you what I used to do when I was a kid for my Saturday morning? Well first of all I'd go down Street and up Street West and up to the top of Street and there was some puddling furnaces, the new side iron works and I'd watch those men they'd produce wrought iron and during the process the metal boils up and I'd have to get a big rubbling bar and rubble they'd call rubble into a ball, there's a little wagon put underneath the put under the wagon and off he goes to the steam hammer, now I used to be fascinated with this and Saturday after Saturday I used to go up there and watch one of the heats and as soon as they'd finished doing they used to go into the Forge and Hammer for a drink, I mean it was such hard work so they'd do a heat go up the Forge and Iron and come back and then do another heat when I'd How long would it take to do a heat? Oh I should think it would be the best part of an hour and er then I'd go along Street down into Walker Brothers call in my father's office. Can I go in the rolling mills? I used to go into the rolling mills and watch them rolling steel sheets and over about half an hour there, this was Saturday after Saturday after Saturday I used to do this. I'd come along Road and up Lane into Street to a shop that had got rabbits in the window. I used to walk along there to see these rabbits I think the name was and they, it was a barber's shop that had got these sold all sorts of pet things and that I used to, then I used to come home that was my Saturday morning, but I always used to go in up to the news line. Now the funny thing about it, when I took metallurgy I got, I, I got all this process I knew all about it you know, and er I had it the theory explained to me then, but er I was in the Bell one day about twenty years ago and an old boy came in and I started talking to him and he says, I bet you don't know what I am? I said no I don't, he said well what I was anyway he said I'm retired now. He says you'll never guess. I said well what was it? He says I was a puddler. I said, were you? He said you don't know what that was, that is do you? I said I do a bit, so er he said, well do you know anything about it? I said a bit, and I never let him know, I thought I'll wait a little bit until he go so he says to me, he says I bet you don't know why they put the damper in just before they'd put the, bring the ball out do you? I said yes I do, he says you know? I said course I know I said to put some of the carbons from the smoke back into the, into the er wrought iron, he says how did you find that out? And I told him that er all about it, but I said do they make, do they do this puddling these days, he says yes at West Bromwich they still do it, but er they used to do it up on Do you recall what they used to wear? Moleskin trousers. Were there any protective gear of any kind? No no just the used to wear like a, a pork pie hat. Did he wear anything in par No no no no not that I know of. Did you see them load the furnace? Oh yes they used to put pig sc iron and scrap in it. Pig iron you know er pig iron was what they had I've seen them pouring furnaces pouring it onto the pig beds, and you know when I was a kid when we lived in Caldmore from about half past nine at night all across West Bromwich, Wednesbury all over that area, you'd see the sky light up and it was due to the pouring of er pouring the pig iron. They open up the these blast furnaces and the, we'd all be in the open air and the reflection there used to be quite a reflection in the sky all round there. Did, getting back to Caldmore. Erm were there any small workshops around doing odd things you may recall, sort of small set-ups? No I don't think there were, there might have been one or two, yes I do know one that used to make some form of er something for the saddlery trade and you know those houses opposite the alms houses in Road, there are some alms houses on the one side, then there's some houses that lie up steps on the other side of the road if they're still there. The back of there there used to be one or two people who used to have little outhouses where they used to sort of make things, and my grandfather up the Pleck, he was a good locksmith and he had his shop at the back of the house and he cou he could watch the Walsall races going on, which is now where the Road is, from his workshop before Street was put and any of those and he could stand in his workshop and watch the races. And when would that be? Oh oh in the eighteen nineties I should think eighteen eighties, eighteen nineties. And did he have any men working for him or did he work on his own? Yes he er he had a nephew for part time but he was a now he was a Wolverhampton Grammar School boy. His two brothers both died with smallpox cos one was, they all three went to Wolverhampton Grammar School and they were a Wednesbury family and they died with the smallpox but I thought they were putting the youngest which was my grandfather for the best trai one was going in for law and the other was going in for medicine, and the youngest was go which was the same as engineering is today I suppose, and he went into the gun trade, and I can remember him, he was a grand old chap and er he used to come and bring the springs that he'd made and to temper them he used to throw them in the kitchen fire, and they'd die out and get them all out of the ashes in the morning, and he used to take his week's work in his waistcoat pockets and his day out was to get on the tram at the Brown Lion, and go straight through Wednesbury and right through West Bromwich up to the Constitutional in Birmingham to Greeners or Wembley and Scotts and he'd got these gun locks as he'd made during the week in his waistcoat pockets. They were very small then? Yeah. That's interesting. Yes and er my mother was frightened to death of guns because, oh he was a bit of a boy at heart I mean you can just imagine everybody used to bring the sporting guns to be repaired and there was guns floating about all over the place, and my mother was scared stiff of guns right till the time she died er, and he got mixed up with all these sporting connections you know like go off to shoots and various things and I think he did a bit of cock fighting in his day as well, but I've, I've got the exercise books that his two brothers. Do you want to see them? You can show me? I can show you afterwards aye you can have a look at them and see what you think about them. Erm yes aye that's the Pleck that's not Caldmore you know. Yes yes but very interesting all the same. Yeah oh yes he oh and he was erm being better educated than the majority of people in the Pleck he used to stand outside the Brown Lion to read the newspaper out to them cos they couldn't read, and he attended all the weddings, all the funerals and er made the wills out and he almost was the father confessor for the Pleck, and when the old steam tram came off the lines down in the Pleck, when there was a steam train coming through there, he was the man who put it on the rails again. What was his name? John . Tell me about transport through Caldmore when you were a young man. Do you mean public transport? Well both sorts. Non-existent until about I shouldn't think there was an a bus did come to the bottom of Road, I can't remember what was, it must have been about nineteen twenty I suppose something like that, it used to go to the bottom of Road and turn round there, but I never er my mother always used to say you'd ruin the trade, the trade down well I don't believe it did really er now I think the lack of transport now you've hit something there, lack of transport there encouraged people to shop in Green rather to go down the town cos you could get anything off Green you know, you just think you'd ju you, you smiled about the er butcher's shops, the grocer's shops, the cake shops, you could get the gents , you could get anything on Green the ironmonger shop, you needn't go anywhere else but, when they started transport er yes I think the buses had quite a bit gradually cos things that, you don't think get things happening in this country overnight I mean, they grow on you don't they? I mean you get a bus coming as far as Road and back I don't suppose it has half a dozen folks on what's this thing coming up here, nobody I'd er I've walked into Walsall all my life and but gradually the whole thing changes doesn't it, and then the thing gets off as far as West Bromwich, and in, then, then there's through traffic and then how far and the Green's not big enough to take the turn around up Road then they change the direction, and it's all done on bit by bit by bit and so Green's got eroded it's er So they took bits of Green away then? Oh yes they did for, for the increase in traffic I mean that er that er went on over the years gradually creep, creep, creep on until the whole atmosphere of the place was er I don't know improved should you say or not I don't know whether it's er well it certainly hasn't improved but erm it changed, it was such a lovely little place really, and of course you could run across the road whenever you liked I mean we used to play in Street of picking out in a sweet shop window er a name be Cadbury's or chocolate or something you'd be standing across the road and you'd be running backwards and forwards backwards and forwards, there was no sign of anyone getting run over cos there was nothing about, and when I was a kid going to the Bluecoat School I'd run across that bridge every morning without looking right or left, because if anything had hit me, well nothing used to be coming you could see a tram coming but oh there was nothing else at that time in the morning oh no it was, wouldn't like to run across today. What about private transport in Caldmore about this time, how was, what was that? Do you mean somebody who owned a er some kind of vehicle, tradesmen some of the tradesmen did but not many that I can remember, no I don't think there was too many of them. Would private individuals have their own transport? No no no no there was nobody, now er probably up at the top of Gallway there though one or two would have er stables I should think, one or two of those houses, but by and large no I shouldn't think so. Now there is another, another part it's very nice and that is round Lane and er Road and all round there used to be very nice at one time. Do you know it? Er I can't er Were there any open rural areas? Oh yes. Yes my playground. Go up Road, and from there turn down Follyhouse Lane the continuation of it and you'd come right to the Dales and nothing at all from there to West Bromwich, and you could see, if you go over one stile from one field then onto another and then brook that now runs through the Road there, that used to be a little country brook that run across the golf course and there was a little stile over it, a little bridge and a stile, then you go straight up to Dells common and not a house in sight. Was it open farmland? No , cut straight across it. I mean that's what cut straight the way across that it was, it was all and my aunt she used to live by All Saints West Bromwich, we never used, we never went to see them we used to walk it down the road past the Boars Head onto the Navigation Inn, and up by the Sandlow and she used to live opposite er All Saints Church in West Bromwich, and erm coming back we should come back round midnight you know and er have you ever heard of the Whirly Gang? Yes. Has that come up in your er in your well we were coming back there one night from my aunt's and er there were quite a lot of policemen about and I was only a little boy, it was before the First World War and my father said to one of these policemen, what's happening so, oh we had a tip-off he says that er there's these Whirly Gang folks and in the morning we saw somebody'd been maimed or killed, but er that was another bit of interesting news around, and I remember down in Caldmore one day there used to be some ladies who used to come from, well they used to be, one of them used to call them the salt ladies, they used to come with blocks of salt on a, on a I think they used to come from and I saw a horse there as a kid and I, it had got a long gash right across its body and I said to this lady I said, what's happened to this, she said oh the Whirly Gang and er I was in Paris in nineteen twenty two and er we got to this hotel and there was another Englishman on this trip and he said to me he said where do you come from? I said Walsall he said oh the Whirly Gang You just mentioned these salt ladies coming round. Yeah. Erm tell me a bit about that. Well all the way from, they used to come from and they used to have some sunbonnets on, I always remember they used to have the, I'm not a dressmaker but you know a la they don't like frills down the back that used to hang down the back and the I remember them coming round selling blocks of salt. Horse and cart? Horse and cart and of course milk was never delivered by, in bottles in those days. I mean that was always a milkman used, there used to be er James was one of the milkmen down Palfrey, he used to come . they used to pour it out of a can you know, it's a wonder we didn't all die of tuberculosis but we didn't. Did anyone else come round the streets selling things? Oh yes the watercress man on a Sunday afternoon and er all the various things were s fruiters, fishmongers, all used to bring their stuff round. How did you know they were in the street, did they have a call? Shout, they'd shout something but er well since we've been living up here, my mother used to give, the man used to come for the order for the grocery, the baker used to come round, the milk used to come round, they all used to come round at she'd ha she didn't have go out for heavy loads of stuff to bring in it was all delivered, but when they started some new technique of er of ordering by computer, it's going to come back to square one again you know, they'll be delivering stuff in the same jolly old way hey. Could be yes. Yes don't you think? Could be yes, yes. Give it fifty years and I'll bet you that the baker and all the rest of the folks, it'll be coming from a supermarket, but they'll be delivering stuff that you've put on your computer. That's right that would be interesting. Hey er well, during, just after the war they started these concerts in the Temperance Hall. Now the Temperance Hall was a very very nice hall er balcony all the way around, it held five or six hundred people er candelabras and all the rest of it, a lovely stage and these travelling concert parties used to come round on a Saturday night, and I should imagine they'd be doing the seasides during the summer and then they came back in the Walsall and various areas during the er winter months, and we used to get concert parties like The Roosters and The Bonbons and all those sort of people come along and they were real and of course fellas my age, I mean eighteen and nine we used to take our girls there I mean it was full of young people er you'd perhaps have been to the pictures one night and it's another way of entertaining really and it was really a first class entertainment. Well my pal and myself we took these two girls and we sat in the middle of the Temperance Hall and he said come on let's sit over on the balcony he says and put up my clothes by the radiator he says it's been raining he says and it will dry them, so we moved, and exactly from were we moved was where the women got killed, just candelabra dropped on her and er when it happened the fella on the stage the comedian was singing, a hundred years from now you won't be here, and I won't be here and from the corner of my eye I could see something gradually dropping like one of these candelabras and I thought hello that's part of the act you know, it was just gradually coming down and all of a sudden, whooosh and the roof came straight in oh and I don't know sure I'd I, everything went dark of course I mean it was all in blacked-out all the chairs were loose, so as the folks wended their way towards the exit doors they took the chairs with them, so they politely threw them back in the crowd that stood in the hall so you were dodging chairs as well as trying to get out, where we were, where we were seated the firemen were hacking at the windows thinking that it was a fire because all the dust had gone up in the air and the reflection of the light from the market I suppose and that would give the appearance of smoke, and he was, I said to this fireman I said there's no fire, he says, he says there is I said there's no fire in here, anyway we eventually got out but I took these girls back home to and I really, it was, properly unnerved us both and as we came on that old tram we were, we thought you know everything seemed to sort of upset us and when I got far more upset on the Sunday morning when I went to have a look at it, the whole roof had come right in, but there were fifty people got injured you know and about, oh there was one lady killed. I knew one of the girls and er she never got right properly again. She got injured in her back somewhere, but er it was national news, I mean it was in The Mirror and all the papers and it became a, for a day or two it was er it was in everywhere, and the theory is that er it was this erm very very dry summer and a very very wet autumn and a bit of dry rot in the timbers somewhere, but it was it was another How long did it actually take you to get out of there? Oh, half an hour. Quite a time really? Yeah, yeah, oh yes of course a lot of the people were, that were in the we were in under the balcony but they were up to their knees in plaster and goodness knows what that had come out of the roof they couldn't move it all dropped round them. So they had to wait to be dug out did they? Yes I've Good gracious, was anyone trying to organize the ? Well you can't in the dark can you really? You can't really, you see we came out into a side door into the old square. I don't know what happened to the front entrance, but there was a basement underneath there and my first wife was dancing in Harvey Martin's dance hall underneath, her pal and herself she, they'd gone to this dance it was a dancing lesson on a Saturday night it was famous in those days Harvey Martin's dance class er yes I Was, was there any damage down ? No no no. In the basement, it was just on the Just on the top yeah on the top of it That's about all I can tell you about that, but er it makes you wonder whether I hadn't better keep out of Street, doesn't it? Ken, welcome back. Could you introduce er the people, your team, particularly as I think one of them has a different name to the label in front of them. Yes, I'm afraid Mike Kirkham has been delayed in Prague for today, so Nigel Spackman, who's a member of our Committee and is a deferred pensioner is taking his place and Les Taylor is the Secretary of our Maxwell Pension Action Group. And you are Ken Trench? I am Ken Trench, I am the Chairman of the Group. Ken, we've you've given us er er er a document in re response to er the Good Committee and your views and so on. We've got a number of questions we want to ask you, because er though you're pivotal to all of our erm activities in this enquiry, we are also looking to a report which is hopefully going to be influenced the Bill the Government brings forward. So we will er if we may er not ask you to introduce your document we we'd like to get on with the questioning. If at the end you feel there are points we haven't covered and I forget to invite you, would you say you would like to make a concluding statement. Yes, by all means. Very good. Jimmy? Well Ken, obviously everybody was abhorred regarding this national scandal of the the Maxwell er pension fraud that er the Committee who were making enquiries obviously were implementing the fact that we should have a report and Goodey was set up and the recommendations that have been laid down as far as Goodey is concerned in order to strengthen the pension scheme so that these frauds can happen again, now have you read the report? Yeah, I've read I don't think I've read every thousand pages of it, but I've, I've I've done quite a lot of of it yes. Mm, having read the report and possibly being on the end of the complaints from the pensioners in the Maxwell fraud er what was your view regarding the proposals that are being made? Well, we feel that there's it's obviously quite a lot of points that are, are very good in the report, but we really feel that it's concentrated very much on the administration of pension schemes, rather than security and I think that whilst if everything that, everyone of his recommendations had been law, I think it would have made it more difficult for Maxwell, but I don't think it would have made in impossible for Maxwell and I think that what th what we see the problem is, is that in many ways the, the Maxwell problem was brought about by two major, major factors I think. One was the failure of the self- regulatory body I M R O and the second one was really the fact that he was able to change his financial year end from April ninety-one to December ninety-one and during that period he was able to do things with those erm those funds in his accounts and er and really there was, there was no check on that, and I don't see that the that was in er Good would have changed much of that situation at that end. It would have made it more difficult, but the way that Maxwell used to involve himself in bulk transfers, you know and move, move two hundred pensioners from there to there and er no money followed and this sort of thing, I think that er that he could of quite frankly done exactly the same thing and we really feel that the, that the role of the pension regulator and the and the opposing role with I M R O that, that you really if we're not careful, we're going to put in another layer of bureaucracy and have a pension regulator who's got the task of of checking a, a hundred and twenty eight thousand pension funds, when really there's probably out of those a hundred and twenty eight thousand, ninety-nine point five per cent of probably being very well well run and, and quite safe and what, what we can't really see in the report is a is a method of identifying the determined fraudster at a at a very early stage, you know and we're just terribly disappointed that er that Good has just thrown the whole of, of the matter back at I M R O who we feel have proved to tha that I don't think they're up to the task, I think that the that the whole question of er of the power of a self regulatory body which to us works on blowing the whistle, you know the whole the whole effect of a self regulatory body is that it's members that it, it's really like a club isn't it, you know and we're all members of this club and if one of us er is gonna do something wrong, then the rest of us are gonna have to pay for it. Well, in the in the question of I M R O as far as it's erm occupational pension scheme members are concerned, er there's no there's no compensation responsibility and I think that that means that you get no, no whistle blowing and in I mean there's, we've got, I mean one of the points that we, we heard of just last evening was that one of the of the banks involved ended up er in its arrangements with Maxwell of asking for a hundred and sixty per cent of shares for every hundred per cent of loans that it made to Maxwell. Now to me that means that that, that city organisation must have been very doubtful about the whole future of the Maxwell organisation when it was getting to that stage, and if one looks through the, through the Writs, you know which now, now number about the same number of pages as the as the Good Report, you know you will get an er a feeling of what Maxwell was doing and how that was all all being happened and with leaving all of that with I M R O we just don't think it's going to er er we don't think it would have saved the position. Ken? Well I think if I M R O I think if I M R O members had had a compen a compensation responsibility or er then I feel that the members would have would have would have allowed certain things to happen. I mean when one starts to, to scratch the surface, let me just give one example I mean we feel er I M R O fails on on its membership I mean the fact that you had Bishopsgate Investment Management which was the beneficial owner was an organisation in Liechtenstein. Now I M R O asked er we understand for the be the management of that organisation to give accounts for that for the c for the senior company to I M R O prior to its membership about a I think was about eight working days before I M R O approved that membership. We we've asked I M R O if they actually got those accounts and what they learnt from the er from the Liechtenstein company and they've told us they can't, they can't tell us it's er it's private correspondence. Can we actually pause there cos you've done a good bit of digging on that one. Er David Shaw on this very I come back to you Ken erm y you've asked some questions, I've actually seen the I M R O letter and can I say that there are two questions in the I M R O letter to Mr Maxwell and Bishopsgate, which quite categorically asked for accounts and also details of the ownership structure coming out of Liechtenstein. I haven't seen the re final reply that went from er the Maxwell organisation to er I M R O but I did see a draft reply. The draft reply contained one threat to report I M R O to the Securities and Investment Board for excessive enquiries er and for an unreasonable attitude and the other er bit of the reply was effectively a form of covering up presenting full financial information and disclosure to I M R O. Those replies were drafted by people inside the Maxwell organisation and you may want to comment on er the position, although I should stress at this stage that I like you have not seen the final version of any reply and I do not know whether I M R O persisted. What we do know is that I M R O asked for this information in June nineteen eighty-eight and not long afterwards I M R O granted recognition to B I M and other Maxwell Companies, all the more surprising perhaps having raised the questions whether the question must come about, did they continue with their investigation, or did they let the matter drop and perhaps you might to comment in that context. Well I think we can all, I mean I think just the fact that they were asking those questions I think literally days before they gave the approval worries me. Ken, but asking the question is rather good, isn't it? Oh, asking the questions is fine. Cos they were actually on to something important. Yes, but I would have thought that you know I M R O sh should of then I asked, I write and asked them the question, I r really would have expected a reply to come back, yes, we found this and so and so, but we then scraped a little bit further and erm. Can I just ask on that Ken? Yes. Do you not think that almost regardless of the reply and whatever that reply contained, with what we now know with the benefit of hindsight about Liechtenstein, which was actually known by I M R O there's not for the benefit of hindsight that wasn't known at that time, shouldn't I M R O have refused immediately to license any organisation that was controlled out of Liechtenstein in those circumstances? Absolutely, absolutely, I think you know, I I mean I just feel there should be a total ban on anywhere where where you can't get the information that you require, you know. So let's leave it there and you, but you were saying Ken, you've scratched Oh, I think the story goes on from there, because I don't think though and this is a personal opinion and I I'd love the Committee to I don't know tha that er I M R O ever did get accounts out of Liechtenstein because a year later B I M the m the ownership of it was transferred from Liechtenstein back to England but guess who the the, the owner was transfer to a charitable trust, so we've got erm a company that is handling the investment management of seven hundred million pounds worth of pension funds which is owned by a charity and the and the accounts that were given to I M R O and these accounts were given to I M R O a year later, were charity commission er type accounts, which evidently showed something like five hundred thousand pounds in that charitable fund and er and no transactions you know, so and that company that was running that was the beneficial owner of our investment company where all the errors took place. Can I, can I just put some other bit of information in front of you as well. You mentioned the accounts of the Maxwell Charitable Trust as having five hundred thousand of assets, I saw those accounts for the first time the other day and I found that they had five hundred and one thousand of assets of which er five hundred thousand consisted of a a purely hypothetical transfer of an asset from a Liechtenstein trust to the U K trust and that asset had no valuation done on it as far as I can make out a and no reference to any valuation appeared in the accounts, so we actually had B I M apparently owned by a charitable trust on the face of it with figures of five hundred and one thousand of assets, but in practical accounting terms and valuation terms, no evidence that those five hundred and one thousand pounds er of assets had any valuation approaching that figure. Can now, can we actually move on a bit because, that has been very valuable what you said, but in fairness to Mr Maxwell it also has to be said doesn't it that up until he stole these assets er this process of throwing organisations, peoples monies into a spin dryer and pulling them out of different sort of sequences was something he regularly did and we've had witnesses to say how well he did manage the funds and how they grew, whether when they should sell stock and when they shouldn't sell stock and so on. So we're actually concentrating on the actual business of that in the final analysis, despite how he behaved, large amounts of funds were stolen and you b you've kicked us off to a very valuable start about whether that would be harder to do faced with a Maxwell-type character if all of Good was implemented. So w we're grateful for that. We'd also for those new pieces of the puzzle you've given us today over erm Liechtenstein. But can I take the questions back to Jimmy please and continue. Well obviously the sad reality of the thing doesn't come home to, to our countrymen and a man comes up last week and tells me that he's been paid off by the Daily Record he's been working for them for thirty five years and he asked what how much pension will he have and says that he's getting four years pension. Now that's a s er sad reality of this er national fraud that er Maxwell committed. Now what I'm saying to you is that there's a big question mark as far as Goodey er report is concerned and they can talk about er the surpluses, they can talk about the trustees, but there's no majority as far as the employees are concerned and this was the question mark that we we were saying that one of the reasons why they were saying you know that the employee should be in the minority because in the end paragraph of the summing up of the Goodey report that states quite clearly that all the responsibility and all the but the employer, now you yourself has said that er as far as the schemes and we're talking of something in the region of a hundred and twenty eight thousand. Now say for instance that because of the minimum solvency er agreement the employers have got to pay whatever their loss is, and if and I asked this question of the T U C that if there was a situation of where the employees were in the majority and forget the pension regulator, because there was a regulator anyway, so you can add whatever name that y you liked to have, but the fraud still went on, but say the employees were in the majority as far as the trustees is concerned and they were in full control and the control was taken away from the employers and there was a a federation of the hundred and twenty eight thousand with a central fund paying off heavy loss of any minimum solvencies, then surely that would be the ideal situation in order to safeguard, because when I asked Goodey himself when he submitted his report, he said they could not give any categ categorical assurance that nobody could defraud in any scheme under the proposals he's made. As far as I'm concerned personally, I think it's very, very weak,take it back and re-draft it and allow the employees to be in the control of their own destiny, because after a national fraud and a scandal that's taken place that we could never trust any employer to carry out a scheme. If I can please er I think our comments on that er perhaps Mr Ray is being er using the grob global flays when he refers to employees. In the pension scheme there are typically three groups of members, the existing pensioners er those people who are still working for the company, the employees and the third group of er members who work for the companies generally referred to as deferred members. They all have interest in the scheme so that we would believe the thing to do would be to have at least an equal number of employer appointed trustees and employee appointed trustees and the employee in this, I'm using it globally, so it does cover all three groups and we also believe it would be advisable because er inevitably the e er members er probably wouldn't know a lot about pensions themselves to have an independent trustee from an independent company who specialises in pensions and pensions laws and could a advise them on exactly what the law says and what they they're legal duties etcetera are. Yeah, but you know that the Goodey report makes it quite clear that the employer is responsible for starting the scheme, winding up the scheme and increasing or decreasing the contributions. Good d Good does in fact do what you said and his recommendation er for final salary schemes is er a third of the trustees should be or have the right to be er from the, the members and er er we've in our er comments to you have er looked at a global point of view and said no not are these proposals worthy in themselves, but using a different criteria that if they had been law as Ken said earlier, would they have stopped Maxwell and a situation where a third of the trustees were er were they members er would have made no difference er cos typically in our cases there were originally about four trustees er and unfortunately for us, three of them were named Maxwell. little further. Peter? Well, yes, just to look at the wh the question of balance of power between the employer on the one hand and the members on the other hand and then between the different categories of members the active payers-in, the pensioners and the deferred pensioners. How do you see the proposals in the er Good Report and what what exact proposals do you have yourselves? Well the proposals in the Good Report as I said for final salary schemes is that a third of the trustees should be elected from he actually says from the active members er we know and comments that in great length a about the difficulties that it would be to er actually er elect er er members who are pensioners or from the deferreds Er I find that er somewhat simplistic view point in that er er the pensioners at least get communications from the administrators of the scheme every month, they get a monthly cheque, so it sh shouldn't be beyond the wit of man to be able to er be able to contact the pensioners and organise pensioner meetings but pensioner trustees to be elected. postal balance easily enough. In fact I think oddly enough I think the way that the Daily Mirror Trustees are now organised with postal balance and representatives classes, I think you know is almost a model now of how a set of trustees should run, you know, they but they have got a very good scheme of how they do actually elect their trustees from various groups of of members. But do you envisage the employers should be in a position of the minority on the scheme? Well I think the whole problem is erm is really we should some someone's got to ask the question are are final, final salary schemes going to last well into the next century. You know because if you are going to ask an employer to enter into a contract between the between an individual employee, then really you've got to give him some advantages to do that and I think that er I don't know what the figures are or the number of final salary pension schemes that have been launched in the last couple of years, but I should think it be, be quite few and I think that there is a difficulty that if we go too far in taking power away from the er from the employer, erm then I, I can see the demise of final salary pension schemes, so I think one's got to keep a balance there of erm you know that i that you mustn't turn the employee off completely from this type of scheme. That's very clear, thank you. David Shaw. Ken, if we could er look at what's actually happening out there to pensioners at the moment, I think of which we're all very concerned, but there has been a small item of good news to balance against the concerns we have for those pensioners that are still suffering from uncertainty and that is some money has started to come in as a result of legal actions and settlements out of court. Can you tell me what the current position is as you understand it Yeah. and what your views are on some of these settlements that have been made? Yes well, erm I think I mean I I did check with the various trustees last week and the current position is erm there was basically a four hundred and sixty million that er that was the original missing figure, to which now goes back over two years er recoveries have come to into over a hundred thousand now with the Hundred million Hundred million, sorry er I got th I I missed off the nought on the end erm It's erm and yeah, er but that was his speciality er so it's so of that four hundred and sixty million er a hundred million odd er just over a hundred million has been recovered, but unfortunately we still have three hundred and eighty million of liabilities erm that is due in part to the fact that with low interest rates really the liability value has increased. So you know there the recoveries are very good, very welcomed by us, but basically we're two years now since this happened erm pensioners have been suffering extreme mental turmoil for that period, quite frankly they're, they're utterly confused, they don't understand what's happening and to ask those sort of people to rely and put their s their, their whole future security on the outcomings of out of court settlements where claims are made for two hundred million and there's a thirty two million you know they're getting totally confused and I think that that they just do not know what's happening, they, they want long-term security, we're now getting an increasing number of people who've retired since the schemes were wound up and are therefore getting a hundred per cent of their, their money from the company fund, which we're told is going to run out in two-and-a-half years time. So we've got this group of people who are and just retired, they're sixty-five and have just retired, and they're looking forward to their pension le lo losing completely in two-and-a-half years time unless something's done about it. I think that's a near suicidal situation. Can I just make one point Ken, cos you were saying they're getting thirty odd million of er of a request of two hundred million. It was actually thirty million wasn't it of a claim for fifty million, of which there was also a secondary claim which was dropped. Yes, yes I think So that so that actual that particular settlement was rather a good one, because it was thirty odd million plus eight wasn't it? Oh yes, yes, no, I think I think that er and I think that you know that particularly the the Mirror Group Newspapers Trustees doing a doing an excellent job you know, but we haven't really got into the into the stock lending er arrangements, but the, the cases those I think are particularly you know important to us you see, because there is a there's another hundred and fifty nine or a hundred and fifty three million I think of, of writs out at the moment and those I think are the ones where we're going to really see whether the, the banks dig their heels in or not, you know, I think we've, we're rea very early stage, but basically I mean we've still got eighty, getting on for eighty per cent of the missing monies still missing and we're into our third, third year. Ken, would you say though that erm one or two recent announcements connected with these judgments, I think including the er the judge in a recent M C C case which actually went I think against the administrators,b on shares but actually the judge said if the argument had been made that er these assets were held er on a trustee basis, then I might have made a different decision. Er would you not say that this has shifted the onus of responsibility very much on to the financial institutions, the banks and others who had dealings with Mr Maxwell, and isn't the judge in effect saying in your interpretation er of that, that these institutions er really have got to show they were whiter than white in their dealings and actually went in and investigated him thoroughly? Well I think I, I mean I do agree and I think that the that er that pressure is now getting on to these, these city institutions, but erm, but I still come back to the basic thing that, that really, you know what appears to me is happening is we've we're having literally millions of pounds taken out in, in issuing these massive massive writs you know, a hundred and seventy eight page writs are sort of being and really the money for those is coming out of the remaining money in our pension funds and really I feel that what wou what is happening is this, as far as I'm concerned, is all due to the self-regulatory body being set under the Financial Services Act, and in a way I feel that you know we're being made to pay for sorting out a mess that somebody else is making. I mean and I think it is the lack of the regulate the er the regulatory control of city actions, I mean one of the points that we've been recently been advised on is that one of the city institutions which has already been er fined, er from its London office on a technicality is in effect the New York and London offices are deemed to be one entity and I think that er what we've been advised is that erm I forget the phrase, I wrote it down here somewhere, that what we would be advised to do is to take action against that particular city institution in New York, because that er it is deemed that the London and New York actions are in fact one and that the that er what in fact the er and I think the f yes, there it is, that, that in a way though what we've been advised is that the basis of that action would be that the organisations London and New York operations are essentially the same operation and bound by a strict know your customer rule as mandated by U S Securities Law, you know. Now I can see the sense of that, you know, we could probably go to a New York lawyer on a no no win, no pay basis and take action agai an and argue that case, but you know is this what, what really people who've paid pensions for thirty or forty years should be dealing with, you know. It was, can I just bring you back to that point Yes. that particular organisation I presume is, is the one that is known as the most profitable investment bank partnership in the world or in history and presumably the reason why you've been advised is because the advisor or the director to Robert Maxwell who was instrumental in dealing with Robert Maxwell business wherever he was in the world and I mean I've seen er faxes and cables to France where er that particular director, I believe Mr Shineberg was, I've seen faxes about Jersey business to Mr Shineberg er presumably er you're being advised to take that action because in effect it was operating as one operation with transactions routed through New York, routed through London as seemed to suit the circumstances, but not necessarily with any rational basis other than er to avoid perhaps regulation. Er Ken, you don't have to answer that the David sitting behind you a number of er representatives of legal firms representing interest and David's making sure it's worthwhile coming today. Chairman, I can't imagine how you could possibly contemplate that. No, I think, I think The interesting point is that, that I feel is, that this is, this, this, this all has a very heavy bearing on the regulatory system, because I think that really we're now being financial services is a global village and you know whether somebody picks up a phone and di I think in fact didn't you have somebody gave evidence here and said that they could not investigate one of Maxwell's transactions, because it had gone through the New York office. Now if we're going to try and eliminate the prob the sort of problems, then really we've got to think of on an international regulatory basis, rather than just in the U K. David? Can I bring you erm back to the U K and what we can do in the U K, although I agree with you, we need to be looking with certain organisations at regulation on a Trans-Atlantic basis, but from a U K point of view, erm the Good Committee Report has suggested that a pensions regulator should er be brought into being. Do you think that if we had a pensions regulator, er it might deal with some of the exploitations by Robert Maxwell er and some of the er aspects of where he breached the law and managed to take over pension funds. I suppose in asking that question I've got to ask you to rule out er all transactions er which have sort of transacted through New York and London at the same, or, or at different times, because quite clearly the Good Committee would er all their suggestions would fail on that behalf You've just destroyed the question I was going to ask you really before I got to the question. No I don't think so, no I don't think so. I mean th there's one little phrase that I picked out of Good which o regarding the, the pension regulator and he actually used the word that he envisages the pension regulator and I now quote will be less pro-active than the F S A regulators. How you can be less pro-active than I M R O I can't understand or I M R O at that particular time, but what it appears to be me is that erm that what what you call a small blues during the week, but Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, you can expect er large blues. Is that on the flats or is it the . Well you got one on the , which has got nothing to do with us. Then you've got one on Walk. Let's have a look round here, check this. Yeah. So what they're doing now, is sealing the walkways off. It's a bit of a So you can't get through. It's a bit of a pain in the neck, cos we can't walk round you see. the whole walk's been sealed off? Yeah the whole walkway's been sealed off. Which one's that, is that the ? It's erm d der I think. And after fourteen months up here I can still get lost. Yeah. and whereas before we could walk round in a on a circular route, Yeah that's Walk. So you have to you're just doubling back on yourselves . Yeah just d doubling back on ourselves. But erm er when the W Winter comes on, the wind starts whistling round this place, it er cuts into your ears a bit. You can feel the cold. You not have any any trouble with vagrants on these empties? Well we've had one or two, as I say, I found a chap in number fifteen, the outhouse, I just asked him to move on. Er next night so I frightened him, I was gonna nail it up while he was inside, and he soon come out . You've not had anybody tear the tin down and No well not as far we've we've found. Er nobody tearing the tin down. . You'd you'd probably come in the daytime, and you'd find some of the tin's been ripped off a bit, you might find a find a corner's been ripped off. And then you know, when you check up on it, the following day, you probably find the council's been back in and forgot to secure it, so we've got s a nail and some nails and a hammer, and we'll er just re-secure it and let the the council know in the morning. Walk, completely empty. It's all this one side of the flats isn't it ? Yes it's all this side, er phase er one, two and three. How do you find it on the parts that are still populated, I mean the Well they're more or less no different to what we're walking down here now. You might see somebody scurrying about later at night or in the morning. It's not very lively? No. No. Creeping off to work. It's the main problem we get to face in the daytime now, is the windows being smashed. And obviously you can er ascertain that er, when more windows get smashed, the locals are gonna start complaining to the council, that it looks a bit of an eyesore, even though it's an eyesore now, it'll be a greater eyes eyesore then. But we're not on the flats in the daytime, Yeah. So there's nothing we can do about it. And most of that goes on in the daytime Mm. does it? And this is Walk. Walk yeah. Number six is the loos. You can walk down here,don't walk down here at nighttime if it's er if it's chock-a-block. Alright then. The lady lives over the blues must have a set of earphones somewhere. And she's got three kiddies so she moves out at nighttime. Yeah we don't erm antagonize them. If we see there's quite a few on the walkways, and if we know that they're outsiders then we'll we'll turn round and we'll walk back the other way. It's better to walk b back, and look at them for a d you know, from afar, than Yeah. try and push your way through. On to. There's a cupboard there that's been ripped open, I mean is that just part of the vandalism that goes on? Well no, knowing our it's probably the er electricity board's come along, to read the meter, somebody's put a screw in it, and they've got a crowbar and just opened it up. That's not vandalism. No. No. He cleaned it up a bit and a scrap yard and it, and this thing and they were like hills and rock gardens, you know like Oh really! hundreds of yards long Yeah. and and deep! Yeah. This bloke, you know, had been working on it for fifty years nonstop and Oh my god! Yeah, Sue Sue wants it o over a weekend don't you? Just give up! I can't, I just wanna sort of look out the window and it's changed completely! Not asking a lot now is it? Oh it's great! Ah! the old boy . Yeah. Ah yeah. Yeah. And they build up the old . Yeah and you don't even notice it do you? So these cupboards have gotta go on here but the door's gotta go up in the meantime? Yep. Yep. Oh right. ,. We've still we've still got a little bit of fiddling Oh I see to do with the what the well we've got instead of all these individual prints I've got I've got long ones cos if the Yeah. floor is Mm. very uneven. I'm gonna fit them. But until you finish the your messing around you're better to leave the doors off aren't you? What you gonna do on the floor? Well we're looking at we were having a look this morning at erm that vinyl floor covering stuff Mm. Mm. would be best. Do you want to see if there's some wallpaper in here Mark? ! No! It's er that that we're particularly Ah that's er lovely keen on. isn't it? Yeah! Got a real sort of er But it's gonna be difficult to decorate around it, you know, and keep it intact but we'll we'll try it. That's amazing isn't it ? How people Yeah. with chi , er tastes are different? Are you gonna keep this, keep this as well are you? I'm sure it was at one time. Gotta be, but carpet, I mean that was ! Yeah. I think the door's nice though! The thing about this is , it's gonna be a nice room isn't it, when the Well quite! Yeah. you know, the garden is done. Got a decent so you're gonna have this as a dining room are you? Well I I I don't know. Well that might just be you know, like another sitting room It's Yeah. tasteful innit? so Yeah I mean Yeah I Lovely! mean Yeah, don't don't, try not to damage any more of it, I mean No , no I really think of that. Are you gonna be able to get some more from the manufacturer to to patch that bit up are you? Patch that together, yeah! . Yeah! And we'll have another fire in here. What was that, an old Yeah and a gas fire thingy was it? Yeah. Yeah. Mm. If we could get a you know, if we could open that up cos we got one of tho th , have you seen the fire in action? In the lounge? Yeah Yeah. I like it. Yeah , yeah got a glimpse Yeah. of that. I like it. Oh . Oh it is, and we put, light the fires Nice and warm. as well. Yes, it is nice and warm actually but That's actually gas isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Derek was saying about it. Gives off quite a lot of heat. And I think they're quite expensive to run but it was so nice we We got rid of that one. we thought we'd try it out. Well the new one was the new one was we looked at one in the gas showroom when this Alright! thing came out Mm. What's the matter? What's the matter? Mm. You're not tape to taping are you ? No I'm not actually I've rewound it once. Can't work out how Mark, we'd like to but we can't work out how! Well you just shove one aerial output th the aerial input on the other one I think. Mm. Or video, no, video No I like it, this one's nice output to video input. I like this. Yeah. Yeah, it's nice that! You've got It's convenient isn't it? That's right, very Switch it on and you can What's that? The thermostat, I'm just wondering how it works Yeah, we know about the thermostats. cos there's another thermostat on the on the boiler itself. Tell me the difference between a volt meter and an amp meter? Well one measures volts and one measures amps! What's the difference between a volt and an amp? The volt is the amount of current passing through Yeah. yeah? An amp amps is current, and volts is volts ! Well basically with a with a volt meter Volt Right? you put the the volt meter across the voltage you're measuring say, like a battery, right Right. got a battery, put the volt Right. across it Yeah. and you measure volts, okay? Yeah, they're fine That tells you how much,wha what sort of voltage battery you need does it? Well that tells you the voltage of the battery at that particular That you're using? time, yeah? I understand. Right. So But an amp meter amp meter you put in series say, like if you put a light bulb across Right. the battery you put one lead on the battery for the light bulb and then the other The other one lead of the bulb would go through through the meter. Right, to the Does that ma bulb? So it'd go from the, from the battery And Mark's gone past! Are we there? Are we there? Are we there? And If we go from the battery to the bulb , from the bulb to the meter To the amp meter, from the meter to the battery from the meter to the battery , yeah. Right. And what does that do? And that measures current. And that measures the amount of current flow to , when did you pick it up? Oh! Well we had it, got it last night. Did you? Yeah. Why's that then? Is that something you're teaching the kids are you? We are we we've got an amp meter and a volt meter and I thought they were the same thing you see. No. You've gotta be a bit careful cos if you stick an amp meter or a current meter across a battery you're effectively shorting the battery out. Right. Right? Cos you've effectively got a dead short through an ammeter whereas a a volt meter's got a a hun , a high er resistance or an open circuit, effectively. Right. So if I put a volt meter on a battery it would short the battery? That's what you said isn't No. it? Amp meter across the battery. If you put an amp meter across a battery? Yeah. But the current would flow wouldn't it? Yeah, the current would flow Yeah. but you would get a lot of current flowing. Depends what the what the a , I mean if you've got an ammeter set to milliamps and you stuck it across a battery Right. the meter would go smack across the thing! Right. But if you have it set to to amps Amps. then you'd probably get, well whatever the battery's capable of . But the first time he's hitting it See what I mean? it bloody hard ! So you've gotta be a bit careful! Well why on earth would a school have an And amp meter for? all these buttons like the normal I mean, I understand why a volt me , you know, I mean, but I mean, battery's have ? has a voltage written on . anyway! I mean, so what do you want a Yeah. volt meter for? Well when they I'm going to look at being funny. Yeah. Oh I'll be out in a minute. Erm if you the thing is,yo a battery might be marked nine volts Right. but when it's dead, it might only have six on it, six volts. Left? Well if it's dead, it's dead isn't it? Yeah, well it's dead yeah but what happens is, when it dies the volts go down, that's why the the yo your radio or whatever got it's operating and stops working. Know what I mean? So if it, if it's got six volts left, it wouldn't be dead would it? It would just be Yeah, it'd be dead. Would it? Yeah. Right. So what's the point of having a volt meter then? Just to find out what voltage you got left in your battery? Well no, your volt me , I use volt meters all the time at work. You make, build a circuit if you Right wanna test the power supplies you put a volt meter across to measure cos if you think So the power is going round? No, that's Well they an amp meter! You just wanna measure the volt, it's just a test meter isn't it? I mean, you get meters normally, the meters we've got at work and you just turn a knob and it's got ohms, volts, amps frequency you know, whatever. And they get them on one machine? Yeah. I mean, you can use a volt meter as an amp meter if you put a shunt across it. Right. See what I mean. Oh well at least I know that there is a, a different thing. It's all, it's all to do with ohms law, if you know ohms law then you'll understand I don't know ohms law. what's what. No. I mean I think really new, newfangled things! It's really not this . Oh it came yesterday did it? Oh she's sitting in it already. I don't know, he's got the key but he's not gonna get in. Oh. Yeah. I'll have a quick shake, shufty. It's very nice. Well the si , the back door's open innit? Oh is it? Yeah, so you can close it. Station please! Cor this is nice innit? First time Underneath I've been in one of these. underneath there that's your miles per gallon so as you're driving along Yeah. that tells you you know, how how you're driving it and onto Oh right! economy Yeah, yeah, got you! er been quite good in that one. Ha, so when you put your foot down the meter goes smack ! That's right. Yeah. There's your lights. Side lights. And what's, is this beam? No, that's er the rear fog light Oh right! and those are you know The beam would be on a stick wouldn't it? Yeah. It's on one of the sticks. Yeah. Yeah erm Oh it's nice isn't it? Electric windows if we go out later. Oh, sun roof as well. Oh yeah You can er adjust the lights, say that Mark's got in the back Yeah. put that on one Oh right, why? cos there's somebody in the back and that's Oh right, cos of, that changes the angle of the lights. Oh right. It changes the two Yeah, mm mm. erm and then you can control the density of the other lights. And they go down at a bit at a time or it'll go all the way down . Mm! Nifty, what? This is your mhm! Oh my god! like that. Is that for the mirrors? Yeah. Oh god! That's Do you wanna drive? Take it for a little drive. No, probably an ! I mean no, I wouldn't ! I'd take any other cars! No I wouldn't ! In any other car, I'd say it was no. Well you took your dad out didn't you? I know, but bit different. Honestly! The steering lock on? If you were to come back there Oh! all the wa , all the way starting up car We'd better get her out of here, she'll want one tomorrow! No, I wouldn't want . How long have you been waiting for this car, a while haven't you Spen? Erm Got a huge accelerator pedal innit? Just like it covers the whole of January. your foot! January we bought January, February, March, mm, that's not bad actually. So incredibly quiet! A lovely sound isn't it? Erm Mm , too right! How many valves has it got? Got sixteen valves has it? Yeah, no , twenty six. Four cylinders four Oh. . Even even with ashtray Yeah. Ah ! Ah no ! Oh that's sickly isn't it? That is really smart innit? Ah that's brilliant! How does that work then? They probably have a big No idea. whole department working on these ashtrays and then Yeah, I would of thought eighteen German engineers just Yeah. on working the ashtray . That fascinates me! Oh that's brilliant that ! No I like the light because like, as soon as as soon as you put your key in the door Yeah. the light comes on, and then it waits until you start the engine until it goes off Yeah. and then when you get out as soon as, as soon as the car comes to rest the light comes on Yeah. and then it stays on until you've closed the door and locked it, you know Yeah. then it goes out. No, there's all sorts of remote to adjust yo you think you're gonna set the clock so you have a little knob Yeah. don't you? But you don't, you've got a button to erm and you just put that . Oh god! I'm surprised it hasn't got a digital one actually. No. I don't like digital clocks No. I'd rather have it like that. For actually glancing down and looking at a clock It's nice. a Mm. dial one is is actually easier to read isn't it? Well What's sa what's the hi-fi like then? Mark . Not bad really. Just do one more when we've listened to it. The radio's pretty good. And the aerial is in is those two strips on the window. Oh yeah, yeah. Rather than an aerial. Vandal-proof job Yeah. you see. Good for vandals, yeah. There is is like a break, this vandal-proof thing, if you park in a duff area Yeah. You pull them thing out do you. Yeah. You can Oh yeah, take it Take your out. radio out and and lock it in the glove box. And they give you you get four keys and one of them is called the chauffeur's key Yeah. and that will drive the car but it won't unlock the glove box or the boot Yeah, for the chauffeur. so if you do , you don't want your chauffeur to know what you've got in the glove box A chauffeur key ! That's your job then Sue! I like these seatbelts at the back! They come from the other way Yeah, it's amazing! don't they? They go the other way to normal. Yeah. That's good actually. They say that's so that if there's an accident They can just get out innit? then people can er get you out easier. Oh course Yeah. yeah! Never thought of that. A lot of design's gone into that. Good old Gerries ah? Yeah. But it's not Yeah but this one did as well. Yeah. These floor mats see they've got little screw in things. Oh, what's the idea? Just twist the lock and they Mm! It's a bizarre amount of detail but It's got a lovely , lovely gear box hasn't it? Mm. Gear stick on that. Yeah. Nice little chunky one. Yeah, it's very nice! The Germans have certainly got it haven't they? But i , Mark you look at this accelerator pedal it's the whole sort of length of your foot, it's Mm. so comfortable instead of Mm. that piddling bit that goes in the ball of your foot. And you find you see you've got that little thing to put your clutch foot on as well. That, next to you. Is there? Oh No. god! No, go to the left. Oh I see what you mean. And there's a little Yeah, yeah a little they've even put that. They're so Yeah, well it's all for comfort I think. Yeah. They're amazing aren't they? How fast will it go then Spence, I'm sure you wound it up? No, you mustn't take it over They've tested it at a hundred and thirty five miles done, eh? You ge yo you mustn't take it over er, three and a half things or eighty miles an hour Mm. for the first six hundred miles. Mm. But the top Oh course, yeah! speed in the book is a hundred and twenty nine. Oh cos you only got it yesterday didn't you? Yeah. Mm. Mm. I don't think we'll get anywhere near a hundred and twenty nine in that ! It's not that so much though, it's just a luxury and the the quietness of the engine and everything Mm. isn't it? Mm. And Er acceleration I suppose. Yeah, it's very good it's very good like between forty to seventy, you know, for actual Mm. pulling away from lights or whatever it's not, nothing very special. The thing is when you're doing No, but I mean but when you're doing fifty and you wanna overtake something Yeah. Yeah. That's when it's very tight. It's very nice! Let's go and see my sis! Yeah, very impressive isn't it? Got a nice sound to it as well, when you're when you're not speaking. Mm. Little But it only works the horns. with the erm the ignition does it? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah we haven't tried the horn yet. Probably goes diddle di der der da diddle der der ! Ooh! Well you wouldn't argue with that would you ? Splendid, yeah! Oh yes , very nice! Very nice Spencer! Nice interior, grey, I like grey. I'm surprised you couldn't Yeah I actually and the door opens for you. Yeah, that's a bit of a let down isn't it? You've gotta ha work that handle, yes. It is really, you've gotta open the door ! Want someone to lift you out as well do you Sue? Well you know. Nice big chunky doors on it. Yes it's very good! Lovely colour! You choose the colour did you? Well I had Cor! like a blanket with bright red dark red or erm or white. It's sort of a is it a sort of bluey green? Or is it a racing green? It's called nau nautic green. Or I mean the reds and greens are a bit boring aren't they? It's Mm. different. Even though it's just a car . What the hell is that The smell? I dunno, it stinks! Phworr, Jesus! Phworr! You're meant to have a a beige upholstery with it but I think the grey would be Yeah. nice. Oh, better. Yeah, I don't really like the . Yeah very nice! If only we could. I like the cigarette bit! Don't even smoke but she likes the cigarette bit ! Ashtray! Don't smoke do we darling? Well no,. Where's your car? Oh it's just up the road. It's just, I I you know, we were there and we'd sort of gone past so rather than reverse Well no, I I just carried on cos I saw a space there, that's all. Ooh! So how come you got a filthy cold then? Everybody went last week and I got it, didn't I? Alright. Are your mum and dad alright? Yeah, they're alright, yeah, yeah! Said we leave it on the back cos we got roped into , but there we go ! So where did you stay then, there? Is it Not much No. chance of that! No I went in bed and breakfast. They know the accommodation you see and it's really grot! Oh. But it's very good! Sort of make breakfast in about half an hour, quarter of an hour. Right. So the North then? Well I'm not get a taxi from the station you know a dump! It's funny actually cos I thought this is the first Saturday when we vegged out to . Well I didn't actually expect you to be in really No. but we thought well we're going up the grave and it's not exactly out the way so we thought we'd pop in. Alright? Erm some of your clothes I didn't take with me and they're at mum's, I I mean I . To be honest, I didn't know what you were really It's lovely! I mean I didn't take a lot with me, I mean I took too much as it was and my arm carrying it across the Underground . And so the Did you go on the train rather than drive? Yeah.

About three lines' worth. Yeah, Mm. they've all got one. So it can be done. All gone. All gone. But I haven't been able All gone. to suss out how to do it. It's only it might be in the ROM mode, to do that. Yeah. I haven't fi ou found out how to do that. That's the telephone. Erm Le telefon. Right. What are you doing with ? What are you doing with it? The interesting thing there Hang on a minute. Benjamin. alright and then You'll be on there all day mate. just being very pedantic about Mm. Mm. But never mind. I will er get What's the point? You just will turn it on and not you won't listen and Yeah it's it's a pose isn't it? Look I'm checking the batteries, right? Go and make a cup of tea Yun. Checking checking the bloody battery. You just waste the battery. don't worry about it do I? today? Erm today we've got er dunno. Rolls, erm a banana and a Was the wife pleased to see ? Yeah. Well she wasn't please to see me, no. No. Well of let me give you an example, if in nineteen ninety erm Pearsons as a company achieved say five percent growth in earnings per share erm the directors' remuneration, and by the way that's not a forecast so I want to make that absolutely clear, it's just an illustration if earnings per share increase by five percent and you could say, er, therefore we would expect directors' remuneration to be perhaps increased by five percent that wouldn't be the case at all our directors' salaries would actually halve erm, Ill say that again, directors' total take home pay would halve because the salary element wouldn't, wouldn't alter. Erm so er i i i er, I think that erm, er er er y you'll see that erm th th the the situation isn't, erm, er, perhaps quite as simple a a as you might, erm as you might think erm and, er, next year if that happened er, perhaps there'd be headlines saying Pearson directors er, half their remuneration. Erm and the reason we set this is that we are erm er the er, er we believe that this above average er growth in the in the, erm, er, earnings per share of the company is what shareh increases in shareholder value really depend on and er again to give an example erm, if you take the, the, the, the, the, the F T S E a hundred companies erm, and you do analyses of their er, growth rates and earnings per share you will find that the average growth rate was eleven and a half percent and ours er, was er, twenty, twenty percent so it's above average remuneration erm, er, er, for above av for above average performance. And I don't think I can say much more than that but perhaps Simon I hardly feel, sir, that erm erm you don't have some influence on your salaries and the other directors' salaries, I've heard a lot of directors and chairmen say that they have no influence on their own salaries. This doesn't cut any ice with me because I believe that none of these directors would be in on the board if they weren't invited there by yourself. So erm Erm well, I, I, I beg to correct you. Er these directors are the bosses of international, erm, companies themselves. They have no, they have no personal, erm, relationship with me er, I'll give you the example of one of our, erm er, er er erm, er most recent directors who's, who's just joined the board, Mr Ruben , who's the head of Colgate Palmo Palmolive, and I just described to him to you how we, erm how we, er er er er er selected him. We went to, er, we felt that we needed, er, a U S director because much of our business is in the U S with wide marketing experience we went to, erm, headhunters er, in America who drew up er, a list of sixty people, culled from their own research erm we narrowed that down as an executive to twelve. We presented these twelve names, er, to the board of Pearsons erm, the board selected three er, we kept one in reserve and I was sent out to America by the board to see, er, the two, er, leading candidates. Erm, I met Mr for the first time in the airport lounge at, erm er, er, Kennedy Airport erm, we discussed at great length and had a very interesting discussion erm, er, Pearsons erm, he accepted er, the job and h I, he has no obligation to me whatsoever and he is one of the er, members of the er, remuneration committee, and I actually take offence at what you're saying. Simon I'm very sorry you take offence, sir. no offence meant and I I really hope that you do not take offence in that way. Erm This may be out of order but, er, personal experience is that the, er, non-executive directors who were involved in the compensation made a recommendation that, er Michael 's salary be higher erm, than he in fact a agreed with, he requested that we lower it and in fact that was what was done. Well, I do hope that our public companies take into consideration inflation in the future. Er, thank you very much. I'm very Ladies sorry, sir, that if you took offence at anything I said. There was no offence meant. Thank you. La ladies and gentlemen Lord has asked me to say a few words about erm er, directors' salaries and particularly about his own. Now I don't stand here in any sense of defending these salaries, in fact I think our policy is entirely right and it is not inflationary. Ergo, we have to look, I think, at the record of this company over the last few years and as the chairman said in his introductory remarks the growth in the company, the growth in the earnings per share, has been very remarkable. The, er, credit to that goes to the chairman and chief executive and the executive directors and they are responsible for the business and it is right, in my view, that they should be rewarded for it and encouraged to take risks to work very hard on our behalf to ensure that that growth continues er, er, that benefits the, er, company, it benefits the country it benefits the er ergo, people who are working for it, it is not inflationary because we are looking at productivity and the productivity in the company has increased significantly. Now, as the chairman said we base the salaries of directors on two elements an element of base salary which looks at market levels and we ergo, have a fair base which reflects a sort of medium to upper level of companies of this size we then leverage, very carefully, a bonus scheme related to performance and I believe that is the right thing to do and I believe and so do my fellow directors who sit on that committee believe that it is one of the reasons that we've seen the great growth in this company over the last five years which you've achieved and which actually the Chancellor of the Exchequer would very glad about because it is increasing the wealth and the benefit of this country, particularly as a lot of those earnings are coming from overseas and will in, in time be repatriated in Britain. So I believe we're doing the right thing, I think it's for the good of the country I think it's for the good of the company and the shareholders. I'd just like to add er, that I didn't take offence at the question, I think it was a perfectly qu fair question, it was the, the inference of, of rigging salaries. Er right, could we go on to perhaps a less emotive issue. Er, my name's John . Could I make a constructive suggestion in this context of board salaries or remunerations or compensation packages or bonuses I'm saying that in a slightly tongue in cheek way because I believe that the majority of shareholders don't understand the differences between these concepts, as you gentlemen evidently do. Most ordinary shareholders have never had a total remuneration package and have never been part of a performance-related bonus scheme. Would you be prepared, er chairman and gentlemen to consider Pearson giving a lead in spelling out, in the next annual report the precise relationship between the bonus element and some parameter which I gather from your earlier remarks is probably earnings per share. I think this might help to defuse the whole situation which is getting a little bit hot, I've been to a lot of A G Ms recently and this topic is coming up at most and one feels that it almost may become an issue at the next general election. W would you be prepared to consider this at another, at, at a future board meeting? I think that's a very constructive suggestion and we'll certainly er, consider it er, in drawing up the er, annual report and accounts next year. Yes, lady at the back. Erm er, my name's , an ordinary shareholder for long-standing erm, it would be very interesting, I don't know whether this is possible now or maybe following on from what the speaker has said, if we had some idea of the American system which is er, I only know very little about it er I, just how that works because we have presidents and vice presidents and, er I think it work rather differently. So it would be rather interesting if we could have some sort of comparison. Would one of our American directors like to I would have to confess that by American standards the er er the, er, directors of Pearson, the executive directors of Pearson and er, the chairman of Pearson and I think that the directors of most English companies are significantly underpaid by U S standards that's not to say it's right but, er, that seems to be the, er ha the current trend. Actually, I, I didn't mean that, er regarding the actual amounts because I'm fully aware of the fact that the American ones are very much higher, it's merely the method by which they are erm My own feeling is that there is a great similarity and that there is a a base salary normally which is set on a competitive level with a target as in this case perhaps at the mid-point, perhaps at the sixty percent level or whatever it would be and that a significant uplift in compensation can be obtained by a bonus scheme, if the performance of the company as measured in earnings per share, return on capital, return on equity or any m other measure if those objectives are met. So I think that th the scheme that erm Pearson uses is er, not at all dissimilar to what would be a fairly standard practice in the United States. and people like that, but er, I believe that the, the way it's actually organized is different. It, again I have to, I have to say that talk about the company of which I'm chairman is that there is a personnel and compensation committee which in the absence of a chief executive sets the chief executive's remuneration and with the presence of the chief executive, although he's not, I'm not a member of that committee we work on the other senior executives of the company, it's quite similar to the process used here in your company. Yes sir. My name is I have been a shareholder and other members of my family for many years much has already been said about directors' and your particular erm, fees in particular. But er it, it, it er it appears to have been overlooked that, erm some of the directors who were in the bracket in nineteen eighty eight of two hundred and thirty thousand to two ninety five thousand have been increased from three hundred and fifty five thousand this year to a top of four hundred thousand. Er, you have also erm mentioned about the bonus er, can I take it from what you have said that this is profit-related? If not I suggest it should be and, er, therefore if unfortunately the profits of the company did go down in the foreseeable future the salaries of yourself and your directors would be reduced. As regards the salaries of the U S A we've read and seen about so many companies that pay sky-high for v various salaries and other schemes, we don't want that in this country but we do want a degree of evenness and I would repeat as somebody has already said, that your salary has gone up fifty six percent which is very, very high. Now there was one other thing if you would care to take it is that you said that it would involve a great deal of organization for concessionary tickets for Alton Towers or Tussauds or any others. Erm Ready Mix have a theme park in Th Thorpe Park and there's no problem there of issuing tickets to shareholders for erm, entertainment of their, their families. They d don't make so much fuss about it they distribute it and it gets on very satisfactory and people er, are very happy to receive these tickets. I think the question of turning it down, that a lot of work is er, forgive my bluntness nonsense. Er one other thing is the the share capital is sixty five billion pounds. It's true that we had a issue erm nineteen eighty five but the reserves are now six hundred and fifty million. Whether you have given this the same consideration of the increase in, er, directors' salaries I don't know, but I think y it's worthy of, er, a further consideration. Er one last thing er, do we need so many as eight non-executive directors which also to be paid? You've got five executive directors I should think that's adequate with one or two outside directors to bring outside knowledge or experience but, er thirteen is too many I suggest. Er well there are a number of, of points there and I'll, I'll try and cover them all. The first you asked again about, er, directors' salaries er, or directors' er er remuneration erm, and I would only say that all the directors are er bonuses are linked to earnings per share. Er, I hoped I'd made clear that if the profits of Pearsons erm er not only if they went down but even if er, there was only a small erm, increase in earnings per share er next year that the the directors' salaries would be very considerably reduced and I thought I'd already made that erm, er, directors' erm remuneration total take home pay would be considerably reduced thought I'd already made that point. Erm on er, Alton Towers which you brought up again er the question is where do you stop? Er, it isn't just Alton Towers, it's whether you should get discounts on Penguin Books it was whether you got, er, bottles of Chateau le Tour erm it, it requests for many different things and, er,you know, alright er, it we could, we could, if Alton Towers seemed to be what, er, all shareholders wanted er, perhaps we, we could consider that but, but, but we do have a number of a attractive products. Erm er your third point was about the balance sheet and I think I'd ask the finance director Yes we, we will give consideration to that of course erm Sorry, can I Apologies. Erm we will, course we will give consideration to erm a further issue which I think is what you were asking us to do. All that does, in effect, as you know is i i is reduce the unit price share price, it has no other effect erm a and I think it's purely cosmetic myself and nowadays I think a share price of around seven hundred P which is, er where the shares are currently hovering, is not e enormously disproportionate but of course we'll keep it under consideration. Erm and your last point was about, erm, er the number of directors and particularly er, outside directors, non-executive directors. Well all I can say is that, erm Sir Simon was being extremely modest when he said that the development of this company er, has been due er, entirely to the executive directors. That that isn't actually the case erm the non-executive directors have been enormously helpful in, er, the field of strategy in giving the executive advice er they play a very full er, role in the develop er m development of the company and erm they also er, keep the er executives, er, in order. Who would sack me? Ch chairman, I wonder if I may just add to that I'm sure you know that the Bank of England the Bank of England have made a very strong point that on balance there should be more non-executive directors than executive directors in the company and, er it is felt very strongly that to get a good mix of non-executive directors really does protect the shareholders' interests and, er I think we're very much following the lead, er, of the Bank of, of England, erm, in this particular respect. And I think that we are very lucky in the very high calibre of non-executive directors we've been able to attract. Name, sir. On Saturday afternoon last What? Your name! Oh sorry. , same as jam! Er, it's very difficult, yes you all laughed when I asked a question last year from over there to get a capital P in Pearson because you all laughed it took twenty weeks to get it in The Times, do you remember? Right. Now we've got a company secretary he is er, an F C I S Chartered Institute Secretaries that's much better than a chartered accountant, they're no damn good as secretaries, right! And the L L B people really they're not up to much, are they? Now this chap is supposed to have constructive commonsense forensic ability, what do we mean,the police? Affability to laugh off his twenty week delay in getting my capital P! Right. Now can we look at his pay cos you all been busy on the directors' pay and this chartered secretary is really important and so that he could be available on a Saturday afternoon if he was wanted. Well now, the problem you say it's emotional shall I say it was blasphemous, it was Rushdie. Now, erm, the situation there was that my vicar came to see me and, erm, what happened was that we've got three churches well luckily, one of them only has about twelve in it another has eighty and another sixty and he said well what did he do about Rushdie? And so well I didn't like what he was doing but at any rate it happened on Sunday morning er, somebody read the lesson and it was Saint, Saint John and there were chapters and of course it was skipping about the verses all over the place, you just got fed up with verses. Right he then went to the pulpit and he said that he was gonna preach about Lazarus actually but he's a quiet fellow and he shouted at the top of his voice I'm speaking about satanic bondage! Er, Mr Yes, is er that blasphemous? er,n what, what, er, er, I think you need to do is ask your question because er Oh right to have a narratable speech is not in order I'm so sorry. yes, yes right. Is erm do we know anything about Rushdie or anything? Another point is, up in Hull in October er, somebody wrote a book about Mahatma Ghandi and he got death threats so the vice chancellor of Hull University he's in Fenners he's a director of J H Fenners in industrial. So I suggest the secretary rings up the secretary of Fenners don't say you're listed in newspapers cos industrial people don't like that but have a word with Fenners and they'll tell you what's gone on. So, what is your question? The question is can a small shareholder do anything for Rushdie, am I doing damage for Pearson? I'm trying Mm. to help Pearson Mm. not pick it to bits over its directors' salaries. Er, well thank you for your offer of help it is, er i i i i it's er er clearly a very difficult issue, there are erm, there are important issues of principle er, in, er conflicting directions it is not an easy one and erm er er er I don't er, really know that there is anything er that, er any shareholder of Pearsons is able to do about it. Thank you. Are there any further questions? Thank you. Well I will now put the resolution to the meeting those in favour would they raise their hands thank you those against there is nobody so I can declare it carried unanimously. Thank you very much. Erm the next matter is the re-election of the retiring directors and a separate resolution is required for each one er I've asked Mr to propose the first resolution. I propose that Mr J H , a director, retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. Right. Thank you Mr . I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against? Thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Mr to propose Sir Simon . I propose that Sir Simon , a director retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. Put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Er Mr I propose that Mr , a director retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried. Mr . Er, I'd like to propose that Mr J C , a director retiring in accordance with article eighty of the company's Articles of Association be and is hereby re-elected a director of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Erm we now come to the appointment of the auditors and the question of their remuneration. Under the provisions of the Companies Act Nineteen Eighty Five their appointment er, requires the annual approval of the shareholders. I therefore propose that Coopers and Lybrand be and are hereby appointed auditors to the company, to hold office from the conclusion of this meeting until the conclusion of the next meeting er, of the company at which accounts are laid for the company in accordance with section two four one Companies Act Nineteen Eighty Five and that their remuneration for this period be fixed by the directors. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against? Thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Well, that concludes the business of the A G M and, er it's now twelve forty and er we can move straight on to deal with the business of the extraordinary general meeting. Erm you already had, er, the opportunity to read my letter of the eighteenth of April er, circulated with the report and accounts, which fully explains the proposals being put forward and which are for firstly increasing the authorized share capital of the company creating two new classes of preference share er, renewing the board's authority to allot shares renewing the board's power to modify preemption rights authorizing the company to purchase its own er, ordinary shares reducing the company's share capital by repaying the existing preference shares er, making certain amendments to the company's employee share schemes increasing the aggregate sum available for directors' fees and authorizing the company to issue summary financial statements. Erm I hope that the, er, circular er pretty fully explains er, these proposals but, er if there are er, questions er, I would be very pleased to answer them. Well, if there aren't any questions er, I would return to the resolutions, er, separately and I would propose the first one which is an ordinary resolution namely it's resolution one, set out in the notice of meeting to increase the authorized share capital of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against? I declare the resolution carried, it's an ordinary resolution. Erm secondly I propose a special resolution, resolution two, set out in the notice of the meeting to create and allot fifty thousand preference shares of U S dollars, a hundred er, each and a hundred billion er, preference shares of one pound each er, I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against? I declare the er, er special resolution er, carried. Erm I propose that ordinary resolution, resolution three set out in the notice of the meeting to grant authority to the board to exercise the powers of the company to allot ordinary shares er, this is an annual er, event I put the resolution to the meeting, those in favour any against? I declare the, er, resolution carried as an ordinary resolution. Erm next I propose as a, er, resolution four which is a special resolution and s set out in the notice of the meeting and is to modify to a limited extent, the obligations relating to the allotment of shares for cash contained in section eighty nine of the Companies Act. Er I put the resolution to the meeting, those in favour any against? I declare the resolution carried as a special resolution. Next resolution five which is an ordinary resolution er, set ou set out in the notice of the meeting which is to authorize the company to make market purchases of the ordinary shares of the company. This again is an annual. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution, er, carried er,as an ordinary resolution. Er resolution six is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting and is to reduce the company's share capital by repaying the five erm hundred and one thousand, three and a half percent cumulative preference shares of one pound, er, each at par. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour S I well I asked for questions before, Mr , but erm what is your question? Why is there a need, sir, to repay the five hundred and one thousand pounds of the three and a half percent cumulative pref shares it's quite a low interest involved. What a low interest share? Well this gives us the ability er, for a tidying up operation but the finance director will give more details. Thank you very much. It's helpful in the context of the dollar preference shares we want to issue because one of the factors of this very small, and as you say cheap er, historic issue of preference shares is that, er no preference shares other than those can be repaid prior to that and the dollar shares we wish to issue which are permanent shares, can be er, can be erm repaid at our option and we do want to keep that flexibility in the context of either if interest rates get very high or if the tax treaty between the U S and the U K changes to make them more onerous on the company and in those circumstances we would be inhibited by the existence of this small historic issue of preference shares and therefore it is on balance, although you're quite right there, a cheap er, source of capital in themselves it is helpful to the company in the wider sense I believe if they are repaid. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against declare the resolution er, carried as a special resolution. Er, next is resolution seven which is an ordinary resolution set out in the notice of the meeting, and it is to authorize the directors to amend the company's employee share schemes in the manner set out in the circular dated eighteenth of April nineteen ninety to members of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried as an ordinary resolution. Erm resolution eight er, set out in the notice of the meeting to increase the aggregate annual sum available for directors' fees to two hundred and fifty thousand pounds I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried as an ordinary re resolution. Erm finally, resolution nine which is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting er, and it's to alter the company's articles to enable the company to issue summary financial statements. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against thank you very much, I declare the resolution carried as a special reso resolution. Erm, that concludes the business of the extraordinary general meeting erm, thank you very much for attending and making it a lively meeting and, erm, my colleagues and I will be pleased to, erm meet you in the foyer er, where refreshments are being served. Thank you very much. long summer break. I just want you to remember the video, someone you don't know is a? Stranger. Right. You don't take sweets you to don't don't take drinks, presents money or Don't take anything. That's right, don't take anything. You don't get in someone's car cos someone you don't know is a? Stranger. What can one say? They know it already Miss. You've been here lots of times too haven't you. You told us before. I know I have, yes I know I have. been here loads of times. And we've watched, and we've watched the video before. Shh shh shh. And we've watched the video before, yes, and we keep learning and we keep coming to tell you don't we? Because it keeps happening, boys and girls in their summer holiday keep get getting taken away by people they don't know and nasty things done to them. So all we want you to do is remember the video remember Pippin yeah? And play safely till you come back to school next term. Play safe and never go with strangers. Strangers. Like James did. never. Like that James did, yes that little boy of three, James did didn't he? Two. Two or three whatever, I've just been Two corrected. Alright. Two. Who's James? Thank you Miss. Thank you. Will you do one thing before you go though class? Will you promise me when you go home tonight you be the teachers and your mum and dad be the children and you tell them all about Stranger Danger and you tell them you're never gonna go with strangers and see what your mum and dad says to you. Yeah, will you do that for me? Yeah. Well done. They don't live with me. Oh I always tell him that. Good man. Thank you very much indeed, thanks for your time. See you later class. Okay,le let's get started! We're, we're going to conclude now the discussion of the various ways in which, bacteria, in particular er lead to the production of infective disease and really to centre round, centres round the discussion of the pathogenesis, that is the mechanism by which the disease is produced and lunanspach. And I hope to run through today, basically, a set of examples of specific infective positions which show particular virulence factors er manifest themselves in terms of clinical disease. We start with er er a fine and exciting topic for Monday morning the topic of boils and in their finalist form they're shown here as starike. But, the sa the very same organisms responsible for that relatively moderate appearance can also produce blocked er region of Prince Charles, the carbuncle with which in it's most er florid form can break down and produce the series, but really effectively interconnecting . If we sample one of these cavities in which the process is er which produce boils er are going on, almost inevitably we find this organism staphylococcusorius and offspotulates have been clearly fulfilled with organism and this disease most notably by a bunch of of medical students who are subjected to all sorts of tortures by their professor of microbiology back in the nineteen fifties. And over the years it's been possible to identify a number of factors produced by these bacteria that seem to make sense in terms of the pathology and the conditions. Now the pathology is by a chief information and i in fact, the chief information could be provoked merely by the presence of organisms. You will, you will recognise from your immunology that the presence is certainly foreign antigenic materials can lead immediately to, to the acute alternatives. But, notable inside er the material that characterises the boils and abscesses, there is a cell death, both of bacteria and of the both the defending cells and the structural cells. And, to a very large extent tri cell death can be related to the ability of staph orius to produce elicit toxins, toxins which actually leave the cell death and . But the characteristic of this puss forming organism is that the legions it produces are wooled off, that is they're relatively localized. And although the er, the causal relationship is not completely established, it is a very helpful way of remembering that one of the principle distinguishing features of this organism which separates it from other members of the genus staphylococcus it pr it produces this enzyme to coagulate things on and the effects of this enzyme are illustrated here as against the control preparation, you see a clot form due to the action of this enzyme on clotting practice which has been put into this test tube serum. So this is almost certain a virulence factor but is also very useful in differentiating pathogenic species of staphylococci from non-pathogenic species. And, as as you'll be hearing in later er stages of the course there are many non-pathogenic species of staphylococci. It's worth also mentioning, since you saw it in the practical class, that staphylococci in general produce this enzyme catalase all of these er lo thi this is the enzyme which breaks down hydrogen peroxide and detoxifies it. All of these factors together lead us an to recognise as it a puss forming organism which is often recognised by the term hyogenic organism, ability to produce puss in er the form of reactions it initiates. Now I want at least, to intro introduce the possibility in the series of diagrams I'm going to show you in this lecture that we can relate it to the four stages of pathogenesis that we, we outline briefly er, in the last lecture. The first stage being the establishment, the next stage being penetration, the third stage being damage, what actually produces the damage in the disease, and the fourth stage is, if the disease is going to last for any period of time the ability of the organism to persist. I'm going to introduce this abbreviated momentictiture here in the hope that during the course of the lecture I'll be able to add comments about which of these factors lead to which of these results. Er, but if we run out of time and I find we haven't we we we can't fit it all in I'd like you all to attempt to do this for yourselves after er, the lecture is over. Okay? So, establishment for staphylococcusorius is often not an important feature because in the majority of infections we're talking about an endogenous infection, the organism was there in the first place. Penetration in many instances is not related to a property of the organism itself, in most instances it's re related to some form of injury in which the organism is moved from it's normal skin location to a deep tissue location. So we won't mention these factors here, although in in some instances er, these properties are important to talk about for staph orius. The damage, is fairly obvious to see is produced by these two and it's worth pointing out that persistence can be related to this catalase enzyme. Staphylococci have some degree of resistance to killing by phagocytes and yo you should recall that phagocytes er, one of the mechanisms by which phagocytes kill intercellular organisms is the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and catalase is one of the ways that these can detoxified and th there's fairly good evidence that the catalase enzyme enables er,staph orius to persist. Okay. So, that's, that's the first example of a very common condition. Let's move on now to consider a very important type of infection such as meningitis. You recognise by particularly common in children not recognised by the particular posture that they adopt and extended neck, rigid neck due to the inflammation of le , lymphees which I will resist being a reflection of the neck, completely rigidly. It's a disease which, if it a , they're fortunate enough to re , recover from the disease, if it's been severe enough the inflammation may have involved er, some of the cranial nerves, and here we can see a third nerve palsy er as a result of er, the process. If you take a sample er, of ce the cera cereblis fluid during the course of acute bacteria meningitis you will find it's drowning, drowning, not due the fact that it's an organism, but present, being due to the presence of puss cells. This is another biogenical fluid and, in about a third of the cases you will find this, very faintly with them Mm mm. which you can just about see here a in conjunction with the puss cells with which it is busily the life and death, life and death tackle. This organism is the fastidious grand negative rod you saw in the erm practical class innocuous influenzi. And it is a a very important pathogen responsible for about a third of the cases of meningitis in in this country almost exclusively in children. Now, the process we recognise in the pa pathogenesis of meningitis due to this organism is as follows, first of all and then it is able, by, mechanisms not completely described but we could probably involve this transpschycosis er phenomenon that er, I I briefly mentioned last time. First of all, penetrates from the into the bloodstream and then into the cerebral spinal fluid. Now the basis for the pathogenesis is not well enough established for us to expect you to understand the details of how it achieves these processes, but one thing which is remarkably clear is that the organism is a capsule producing organism and that once it gets into the er cerebral spinal fluid that predominately is an acute inflammatory . We do recognise establishment factors, that is adhesions in this part of the process and it is very clear that the capsule is one of the factors which allows the organism to pe , persist because it helps the organism to resist phagocytosis. You'll notice that the damage in this instance is actually the result of the acute inflammatory response, not particularly some form of direct noxious effect of the organism, so the contribution of the host is absolutely critical. Now, the reason we we focus on the capsule as illustrated on the right here is that hymophylus have many different capsular types, but but only one type appears to be associated with meningitis. This type B capsule refers to a particular pulse and has it's so important in the pathogenesis of the capsule that antibodies to it can be used er,ca , er can actually completely prevent the disease and we end up with a capsule vaccine based on the type B pulse . Plus, referencing with the other two organisms which produce meningitis in, in humans it is very prominent that both of these, licea meninigitipitus and staphylococcus are also very prominent capsule mechanisms. Hello! That's like the type. H I for hymopholus influenzi. And that's, that H I is actually the th th H, H I B is the acronym for the vaccine. There's a new vaccine introduced last October which is being er, used for the first time in this country to prevent meningitis in children. Is that just the name of the vaccine? H, well H I B is a, an abbreviation for the strain of hymopholus that produces the infection, but the name of the vaccine the H I B vaccine, yeah. Okay? I should say that a, a lot of this information will be covered again during this course, what I'm trying to do now is to bring together the the themes in a pathogenesis of infection that I introduced last week into the practical context of clinical infections. And to to, to try and illustrate to you why we focus on particular virulence factors for particular organisms. Move on now to to look at an area that's er not frequently er doesn't impinge a great deal on life in this country but it certainly does for travellers and for many people in the developing world. This is the topic of secretory diarrhoea produced by infective agents. This is a dramatic disorder of the small intestine which produces a massive outflow of water electrolytes that can be fatal within a matter of hours after the onset of disease! We recognise two agents which are er, responsible in bacterial causes of this process,th there are many others but these are certainly the most important. choleri, the cholera vacilus and er, an acronym here, ETEC, I wouldn't worry about taking down the full er, er , it actually stands for e entrotoxigenic ecolytes, it's a strain or a group of ecolars that are able to produce this effect. These diseases are common in areas er where an out pouring of water from the individual is squared up with a ou , out pouring of people into the water, then you can appreciate that that transmission is very er, readily promoted under those circumstances. The effects on the, the individual are very dramatic! Dehydration, er can produce death within a matter of fe , er a few hours and and an understanding of the mechanism by which this dehydration leads us into one of the most effective forms of heat treatment er, ever produced. A prominent feature of secretory diarrhoea is that effective and normal bowel in,yo you ca , you can ignore this sign are almost indistinguishable, so despite this dramatic change in the physiology of the small bowel, borthalogically it actually looks quite normal. And you have a normal meconium. Now, the organisms that produce this effect haven't, have this target which is around zero for the choleri , the villi of a small intestine and the both of these organisms have pro prominent adhesion mechanisms. Let's just show you something with that. In an affected small bowel you will see the grey background with these tiny little curved rods present the whole area of the er, the villi is covered by the organisms which are er stuck down effectively by the processes which you ca , you can't really see them in the transmission micrograph, but they are attached to specific receptors on the surface of the entrocite membrane. Once they've got there, the organism really goes no further. Both the cholera organism and the ETEC organism secrete toxins referred to here as C T for cholera toxin and LT for the le Lethane toxin. It is very striking that these toxins are actually almost exactly the same molecule! So that although these are er fairly different relatives in terms of bacteria it's striking that the ETEC organism has been able to acquire in some way almost exactly the same gene that's present in choleri. And, this toxin when released from these tightly organisms disorders the er the physiological activity of the lining cells, the empha cells. The molecular oh we've lost a slide! The molecular basis for this is very well understood and forms one of the important themes in er the effects of e , exotoxin in human cells. This toxin is composed of two components er, of binding components and active component. Binding component binds to specific receptors on the emphacyte and the active component penetrates into the cell and inactivates the controlling mechanism on the production of . And this is the cell that er, is possessed by several other toxins that affect, not just the gut but other parts of the body as well. I should point out that in one of the features of adhesions is that it takes two to tango, so to speak! Where specific adhesions are involved the the , the structures that are, are most commonly associated with a , require a specific receptor for the adhesion reaction to take place and that if the potential host doesn't have specific receptor they're not susceptible to that particular strain of organisms. Okay. Let's move on to look at another fairly dramatic infection which is a case of diphtheria. That, which is er a infection ca characterized by this profuse athema of th the base of the neck, referred to as bull neck if you look inside this child's er pharynx you see this very messy inflammatory process at the back and the whole of the respiratory mucosa is beginning to detach in what's referred to as a pseudo-membrane. In, fatal cases this pseudo- membrane can extend right from the top of the respiratory track here down into bronchi, and you can get these enormous casts of mucrotic material er, starting in the pharynx and working their way right down in the bronchi. It's been known for a very long time that from these cases you can isolate this organism C diphtheria bacterium which you saw in the practical classes and has this distinctive stayed property where er certain granules can be stayed up and also the arrangement of the cells is rather reminiscent of what called Chinese lettering. The picture, the acute picture which you've just seen is virtually exclusively due to the production of a toxin and that toxin produces really a necrotic pharyngitis inflammation of the pharynx associated with necrosis and detachment of what we call the pseudo-membrane. In very severe cases the toxin gets into the blood stream and their paralytic effects toxin i i is to some extent a neuro-toxin, and also there are effects of the heart. So although for the majority of cases that a fatal as a result of diphtheria the fact that , due actually to the pharyngitis and the pseudo- membrane obstructing the respiratory passage. In later stages, the minority of cases may go on to produce these results. Well this is a disease due to another exotoxin which, in practical terms is of importance to you because it's the basis for a test for identifying the . The toxin may or may not be present in strains of er C diphtheria and this is just an immunological test so I wo won't explain it in detail but what you can see is a a strip of er, filter paper which has been bathed in anti-toxin and growth of various different strains of the organism erm which, some of which do produce the toxin you can see lines of precipitation here and some of which don't produce the toxin. And that test has to be applied to es each eyslate because this toxin is not part of the genome of Cherani bacteria diphtheria, it's actually a farged mediated toxin, it's actually encoded for by a bacteria farged. So when What's paresis then? Paresis, paralysis. Oh! I thought you were doing neuro-sciences course? The as I said this, this is required for identification for the organism, but the to the toxin has been recognised for a very, very long time and right from er, the early days the possibility of inactivating the biological properties of a toxin while retaining their immunological properties has been attractive to people seeking to prevent these diseases. And, if you treat this toxin with something like formaldehyde or ethanol, you end up by inactivating it's toxic properties and you end up with what, what we call a toxoid, something that retains immunological properties, it's able to stimulate specific immunity to the toxin but it doesn't have any of the toxic effects and we end up with this toxoid vaccine against diphtheria. And all of you, I would expect, have received the toxoid vaccine against diphtheria. Curiously it has led effectively to the irradification of Cherani bacterium diphtheria from the circulating respiratory flora in this country and the reasons for that are are quite obscure! Another im prominent toxoid vaccine which you should all have received and be regularly receiving boosters for is the tetanus vaccine, and really, a very similar situation pertains here, that the toxin is so important in the pathogenesis of disease, tetanus, that simply immunity to that one factor can lead to immunity er to the disease as a whole. So, I've gone through a series of examples of exotoxins I want to just er, as far as is possible summarize the general properties of exotoxins. First thing to be said about them is that they're all proteins covering a very wide range of molecular weights between three and three hundred kilobocals three thousand to three hundred thousand bocals. And they have very specific impacts because they all result their effective result on an interaction with a specific receptor and er an activity I would express on that receptor or as a result of the er erm the uptake of the toxins. Consequently,. As I've indicated before you can divide them into patha and physiological effects and membrane damage more specifically than what I said before membrane damage is the i i is a particularly important thing. Your patha and physiological toxins are often sub-unital structure and they make the most, the momegictiture most widely used is an A plus B sub-unit structure. The B is a receptor and A is often, although by no means always, an enzyme and in the case the cholera toxin rotusis toxin and several other erm pseudo-membrane toxins and several others, diphtheria toxin they have the specific A viral I think they put the group onto a target molecule and disorder itself . The membrane doesn't use toxins like the lytic toxins that staphylococcusorius expressed er they're often detected by their immunelytic properties, see the in the er, in the bacterial passage. I'm sure you've experienced in many instances here, the effect of lytic toxins in er a boil or some some other unpleasant minor lesion! Gonna go on now to talk about a severe condition which may start out that with a minor skin rash like this, this is called a petechial skin rash they later progress to rather more generalised rash and in it's most severe form it's mucrotic effects on the skin and er, obviously a lethal outcome! This type of picture is almost exclusively related to the isolation of grand negative organisms from the blood, these may be phacili or cocci, doesn't really make any er, any difference. It's the grand nega negative cell wall structure that seems to matter. And we now know that these ghastly effects are the results of what we referred to in the last lecture endotoxins. You will hear in considerable detail in a later lecture about how septic shock and endotoxin work. At this stage it's worth remarking that wa there are perhaps three prominent features of endotoxin effects first of all, they promote physcocine release and th the the two pro , prominent phsycocines affected are I O one, Interlooping one and TMF, tumourmacrosis factor which I hope you heard about in the immunology course. I O one is the molecule most closely associated with the mi , the effects of lodose endotoxin and that is fever I O one er, when released into the blood sys bloodstream affects the hypothalamus and th i one of the principle reasons why infective conditions lead to fever. In more severe situations there's uncontrolled continent acto activation and uncontrolled clotting factor, activation and it's really that last feature that's particularly responsible for the er er ghastly skin disease you saw i in the last sla , in the previous slide! Now the eff the endotoxin as I've is almost exclusively associated with the grand negative cell wall. And again in abbreviated form that, I just want to take you through the molecular basis for endotoxin action. Here is the positive wall with it's large er expansive petroglycan grand negative with an inner and an outer membrane, and the petroglycan sandwiched in between. Here we have a diagram of a grand negative organism with it's inner membrane and outer membrane illustrated here. Very easy to reproduce endotoxic shock in in experimental animals and er, it was found fairly early on that the effects, er the endotoxic effects were almost exclusively associated with the outer membrane. And detailed chemical strains of the outer membrane show that it has a slightly different structure from normal unit membranes. Expand that up, you'll end up with a normal inner leaflet to the membrane, a phospholipids but the outer the , er the outer layer is almost exclusively composed of this stuff, lycropolysacrulite I mentioned this in an earlier lecture but we need to go into in a little bit more detail . This lycropolysacrulite is can then be broken up into three different sections the internal membrane section is referred as lipid A. Lipids in general are not very antigenic erm er it's interesting to note that lipid A, when it's purified from the other components is almost totally responsible for the toxic amount of any property. The polysacurised component of composed of a four region to which the lipids are attached, and that outer region is er, it extends out into the environment . Now, the importance here is that both of these polysacrulite components are based in general the outer region is highly variable, that's to say that very, er that most of organisms possess a unique outer region to that polysacrulite . And by contrast, the poor region, certainly amongst the grand negative bacilli is very similar across a wide range of different species and this provides a very important opportunity to produce immunity to endotoxin directed against the core and this possibility has recently been exploited by a production of the molecule antibody directed against the core polysacride of the erm er er, of ecoli. So, this has been shown to be effective in moderating the toxic events which occur in grand negative shock. Building on this approach and something which I think you'll see certainly during the course of your your medical studies antibodies directed against tumourler proce , tumourler process factor are now being used to try and interrupt the chain of events at a slightly later stage. So that's that's the endotoxin story. I want now just to summarise and er some of these the features I'm going to point out I've I've already stated so you may may just want to sit back and just take this in. If we compare endo and exotoxins endotoxins are only associated with grand negative organisms whereas exotoxins maybe produced by either grand negative or grand positive. Endotoxins are exclusively cell associated in their production. Exotoxins may also be cell associated, they've, they may not be a sa , they're not a structural component, but, particularly in grand negatives exotoxins er, are released first into the peraplasmic space, the space between the two membranes, and the the actual release into the medium er, may require cell . So,tha they are both cell associated and cell free. Endotoxin from different organisms although it may be of of different potency has essentially the same biological effects. So, a wide variety of different organisms can produce endotoxic shock. But exotoxins from different organisms produce really very different biological effects. Even, even though they may be er,the they may work as a result of different o of the same enzyme activity in some cases the target for that enzyme activity and the receptors that have put it into the specific cells that are targeted lead to really very different biological effects. In general terms endotoxins are a very low potency about point O one of a gram is lethal to one person some exotoxins are incredibly potent, and they're being the, the subject of er a certain amount of er weapons research. The same goes for O one of a gram for example,toxin and it gives you a hundred thousand er as as I've indicated here, there's a, a wide range for the potency. Endotoxins are heat stable, and this is very important when we try to produce materials that are safe for intravenous injection. Whereas, for the most part exotoxins are destroyed by heat into a hundred degrees centigrade. And finally treatment with er formaldehyde or ethanol has no effects on endotoxins but in a number of instances formaldehyde or ethanol will lead to er, the production of toxoid. So, I think you should now have a very clear basis for discriminating between the two sorts of two sorts of toxin. And we can move safely on to another another, and the final really, final topic about the patterns of pathogenesis. Let's move on now, briefly, to consider this disease, tuberculosis. This is a, a normal test x- ray the commonest manifestation of tuberculosis is the disease of des destructive regions in the upper poles of the lungs and pathologically the very nasty destructive lesions er, are appearing in in the area. And in a mi , in a minority of cases you may get a sort of forminant region, this is er small scale, it's perhaps a centimetre apart, across a series of lung lesions containing these little necrotic due to the er the presence of tubercle cila. Although this was this organism, microbacterium tuberculosis, named tuberculosis was discovered back in eighteen eighty we we really understand the pathogenesis of the disease very poorly! What we know for sure is is really outlined here. The organism is in i is inspired into the alveolar spaces and it's taken up by alveolar , the standard er abbreviation for macrophage and, the organism i in contrast to many others which we've sort of er die fairly rapidly after being taken up by these phagocytic cells, says Goodee! That was exactly what I wanted to happen! And it grows very rapidly, within macrophages and after er a period of time is actually disseminated into the circulation. Now, this happens in nearly all er cases o of tuberculosis but, interesting, the vast majority of infections microbacterium tuberculosis are asymptomatic and the reason for that is that after a period of growth and dissemination does not lead to clinical symptoms, cell mediated immunity, C M I, comes into comes into play and you end up with a balance between the macrophages, and fi and M T B, where there's a constant turnover of macrophages dying, and M T B winning out. Excuse me! Hello! Yep? What's the M T B? Microbacterium tuberculosis. Okay. Thank you. You have a balance between the effects of macrophages which have been activated by cell mediator immunity and the lethal effects of microbacterium tuberculosis. In individuals in whom some mediated immunity is not well developed the growth and defemination,de defemination phase may take over altogether. If the C M I doesn't lead to this kind of balance then it can have this sort of effect and get rapidly fatal tuberculosis occurring at the time of the primary infection. But it's believed that the majority of cases of tuberculosis, that we actually see, are so called post-primary tuberculosis where all of this process is taking place asymptomatically and the host is in this state of balance but something else comes along and stresses cell mediated immunity and the control breaks down so that th the organism M T B wins out very dramatically over the, over the macrophages and you end up with this post-primary is whether its shareholders could write in to apply for a concessionary ticket to Alton Towers and get a reduced price if they so wish. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr . Er er, I've, er I just I'm just saying that, er, that, that last year er, when I made a few remarks that they were misquoted by Reuters and we did leave the meeting and the share price dropped by er, several P and we had to send out a correcting statement so this year we've taken the precaution of issuing a press release er, at the same time as er, er, I'm making these remarks so I hope at least they won't be misinterpreted. Erm as to I think I heard you say er, ask about concessionary prices to Alton Towers, was that correct? Ya. Well er we, we've taken a, a, a policy view over the years because the group has a number of er very attractive er products and, and, and, and shareholders have frequently asked if was possible erm, to have concessions in all sorts of areas and the view we've taken is that it involves a, a, a, a, a great deal of administration and that our real job is to er increase the profits of the business er,a as well as we can and then to pay dividends to the shareholders erm who will er, er, then use that money er, hopefully to buy a good number of our products. Yes sir. Good morning. My name is and, er it appears to me, sir that you like to make life difficult for the managers to negotiate wage settlements with the employees of the company I note that your salary has increased by more than fifty percent in one year. That I don't think will please John Major or Mrs Thatcher for being, er seeing you fuelling and other directors and all the directors of our public companies fuelling inflation with their inflationary wage rises doesn't seem reasonable whatsoever and I think that er one should consider this in a different light. Thank you for er, question. There's been quite a lot of comment in the press erm, on high levels of, of salary of, of remu remuneration for directors and I think it might be helpful er, if I was were t were, were to make some general remarks on the background er, of how we er, approach directors' remuneration. On the question of my own er er, er, position I think I would ask, er, in a minute to have Sir Simon to say something because er, er, er, I don't, I I, you know, I don't set my own remuneration. Er, and in general we have a, er, panel of the non-executive directors who set the directors' salary in relation to the other directors I am also on that panel er, but obviously not in relation to my own salary. Erm we have, er, access to the advice of professional advisers, namely and Co our policy is to keep base salaries at the mid-point of market competitive range erm, and provide bonus opportunities that can lift total take home pay into the upper quartile. Erm the bonus element of the Pearson scheme is highly leveraged we are very keen to achieve above-average performance for our shareholders and let me give you an example, if in nineteen ninety erm Pearsons as a company achieved say five percent growth in earnings per share erm the directors' remuneration, and by the way that's not a forecast so I want to make that absolutely clear, it's just an illustration if earnings per share increase by five percent and you could say, er, therefore we would expect directors' remuneration to be perhaps increased by five percent that wouldn't be the case at all our directors' salaries would actually halve erm, Ill say that again, directors' total take home pay would halve because the salary element wouldn't, wouldn't alter. Erm so er i i i er, I think that erm, er er er y you'll see that erm th th the the situation isn't, erm, er, perhaps quite as simple a a as you might, erm as you might think erm and, er, next year if that happened er, perhaps there'd be headlines saying Pearson directors er, half their remuneration. Erm and the reason we set this is that we are erm er the er, er we believe that this above average er growth in the in the, erm, er, earnings per share of the company is what shareh increases in shareholder value really depend on and er again to give an example erm, if you take the, the, the, the, the, the F T S E a hundred companies erm, and you do analyses of their er, growth rates and earnings per share you will find that the average growth rate was eleven and a half percent and ours er, was er, twenty, twenty percent so it's above average remuneration erm, er, er, for above av for above average performance. And I don't think I can say much more than that but perhaps Simon I hardly feel, sir, that erm erm you don't have some influence on your salaries and the other directors' salaries, I've heard a lot of directors and chairmen say that they have no influence on their own salaries. This doesn't cut any ice with me because I believe that none of these directors would be in on the board if they weren't invited there by yourself. So erm Erm well, I, I, I beg to correct you. Er these directors are the bosses of international, erm, companies themselves. They have no, they have no personal, erm, relationship with me er, I'll give you the example of one of our, erm er, er er erm, er most recent directors who's, who's just joined the board, Mr Ruben , who's the head of Colgate Palmo Palmolive, and I just described to him to you how we, erm how we, er er er er er selected him. We went to, er, we felt that we needed, er, a U S director because much of our business is in the U S with wide marketing experience we went to, erm, headhunters er, in America who drew up er, a list of sixty people, culled from their own research erm we narrowed that down as an executive to twelve. We presented these twelve names, er, to the board of Pearsons erm, the board selected three er, we kept one in reserve and I was sent out to America by the board to see, er, the two, er, leading candidates. Erm, I met Mr for the first time in the airport lounge at, erm er, er, Kennedy Airport erm, we discussed at great length and had a very interesting discussion erm, er, Pearsons erm, he accepted er, the job and h I, he has no obligation to me whatsoever and he is one of the er, members of the er, remuneration committee, and I actually take offence at what you're saying. Simon I'm very sorry you take offence, sir. no offence meant and I I really hope that you do not take offence in that way. Erm This may be out of order but, er, personal experience is that the, er, non-executive directors who were involved in the compensation made a recommendation that, er Michael 's salary be higher erm, than he in fact a agreed with, he requested that we lower it and in fact that was what was done. Well, I do hope that our public companies take into consideration inflation in the future. Er, thank you very much. I'm very Ladies sorry, sir, that if you took offence at anything I said. There was no offence meant. Thank you. La ladies and gentlemen Lord has asked me to say a few words about erm er, directors' salaries and particularly about his own. Now I don't stand here in any sense of defending these salaries, in fact I think our policy is entirely right and it is not inflationary. Ergo, we have to look, I think, at the record of this company over the last few years and as the chairman said in his introductory remarks the growth in the company, the growth in the earnings per share, has been very remarkable. The, er, credit to that goes to the chairman and chief executive and the executive directors and they are responsible for the business and it is right, in my view, that they should be rewarded for it and encouraged to take risks to work very hard on our behalf to ensure that that growth continues er, er, that benefits the, er, company, it benefits the country it benefits the er ergo, people who are working for it, it is not inflationary because we are looking at productivity and the productivity in the company has increased significantly. Now, as the chairman said we base the salaries of directors on two elements an element of base salary which looks at market levels and we ergo, have a fair base which reflects a sort of medium to upper level of companies of this size we then leverage, very carefully, a bonus scheme related to performance and I believe that is the right thing to do and I believe and so do my fellow directors who sit on that committee believe that it is one of the reasons that we've seen the great growth in this company over the last five years which you've achieved and which actually the Chancellor of the Exchequer would very glad about because it is increasing the wealth and the benefit of this country, particularly as a lot of those earnings are coming from overseas and will in, in time be repatriated in Britain. So I believe we're doing the right thing, I think it's for the good of the country I think it's for the good of the company and the shareholders. I'd just like to add er, that I didn't take offence at the question, I think it was a perfectly qu fair question, it was the, the inference of, of rigging salaries. Er right, could we go on to perhaps a less emotive issue. Er, my name's John . Could I make a constructive suggestion in this context of board salaries or remunerations or compensation packages or bonuses I'm saying that in a slightly tongue in cheek way because I believe that the majority of shareholders don't understand the differences between these concepts, as you gentlemen evidently do. Most ordinary shareholders have never had a total remuneration package and have never been part of a performance-related bonus scheme. Would you be prepared, er chairman and gentlemen to consider Pearson giving a lead in spelling out, in the next annual report the precise relationship between the bonus element and some parameter which I gather from your earlier remarks is probably earnings per share. I think this might help to defuse the whole situation which is getting a little bit hot, I've been to a lot of A G Ms recently and this topic is coming up at most and one feels that it almost may become an issue at the next general election. W would you be prepared to consider this at another, at, at a future board meeting? I think that's a very constructive suggestion and we'll certainly er, consider it er, in drawing up the er, annual report and accounts next year. Yes, lady at the back. Erm er, my name's , an ordinary shareholder for long-standing erm, it would be very interesting, I don't know whether this is possible now or maybe following on from what the speaker has said, if we had some idea of the American system which is er, I only know very little about it er I, just how that works because we have presidents and vice presidents and, er I think it work rather differently. So it would be rather interesting if we could have some sort of comparison. Would one of our American directors like to I would have to confess that by American standards the er er the, er, directors of Pearson, the executive directors of Pearson and er, the chairman of Pearson and I think that the directors of most English companies are significantly underpaid by U S standards that's not to say it's right but, er, that seems to be the, er ha the current trend. Actually, I, I didn't mean that, er regarding the actual amounts because I'm fully aware of the fact that the American ones are very much higher, it's merely the method by which they are erm My own feeling is that there is a great similarity and that there is a a base salary normally which is set on a competitive level with a target as in this case perhaps at the mid-point, perhaps at the sixty percent level or whatever it would be and that a significant uplift in compensation can be obtained by a bonus scheme, if the performance of the company as measured in earnings per share, return on capital, return on equity or any m other measure if those objectives are met. So I think that th the scheme that erm Pearson uses is er, not at all dissimilar to what would be a fairly standard practice in the United States. and people like that, but er, I believe that the, the way it's actually organized is different. It, again I have to, I have to say that talk about the company of which I'm chairman is that there is a personnel and compensation committee which in the absence of a chief executive sets the chief executive's remuneration and with the presence of the chief executive, although he's not, I'm not a member of that committee we work on the other senior executives of the company, it's quite similar to the process used here in your company. Yes sir. My name is I have been a shareholder and other members of my family for many years much has already been said about directors' and your particular erm, fees in particular. But er it, it, it er it appears to have been overlooked that, erm some of the directors who were in the bracket in nineteen eighty eight of two hundred and thirty thousand to two ninety five thousand have been increased from three hundred and fifty five thousand this year to a top of four hundred thousand. Er, you have also erm mentioned about the bonus er, can I take it from what you have said that this is profit-related? If not I suggest it should be and, er, therefore if unfortunately the profits of the company did go down in the foreseeable future the salaries of yourself and your directors would be reduced. As regards the salaries of the U S A we've read and seen about so many companies that pay sky-high for v various salaries and other schemes, we don't want that in this country but we do want a degree of evenness and I would repeat as somebody has already said, that your salary has gone up fifty six percent which is very, very high. Now there was one other thing if you would care to take it is that you said that it would involve a great deal of organization for concessionary tickets for Alton Towers or Tussauds or any others. Erm Ready Mix have a theme park in Th Thorpe Park and there's no problem there of issuing tickets to shareholders for erm, entertainment of their, their families. They d don't make so much fuss about it they distribute it and it gets on very satisfactory and people er, are very happy to receive these tickets. I think the question of turning it down, that a lot of work is er, forgive my bluntness nonsense. Er one other thing is the the share capital is sixty five billion pounds. It's true that we had a issue erm nineteen eighty five but the reserves are now six hundred and fifty million. Whether you have given this the same consideration of the increase in, er, directors' salaries I don't know, but I think y it's worthy of, er, a further consideration. Er one last thing er, do we need so many as eight non-executive directors which also to be paid? You've got five executive directors I should think that's adequate with one or two outside directors to bring outside knowledge or experience but, er thirteen is too many I suggest. Er well there are a number of, of points there and I'll, I'll try and cover them all. The first you asked again about, er, directors' salaries er, or directors' er er remuneration erm, and I would only say that all the directors are er bonuses are linked to earnings per share. Er, I hoped I'd made clear that if the profits of Pearsons erm er not only if they went down but even if er, there was only a small erm, increase in earnings per share er next year that the the directors' salaries would be very considerably reduced and I thought I'd already made that erm, er, directors' erm remuneration total take home pay would be considerably reduced thought I'd already made that point. Erm on er, Alton Towers which you brought up again er the question is where do you stop? Er, it isn't just Alton Towers, it's whether you should get discounts on Penguin Books it was whether you got, er, bottles of Chateau le Tour erm it, it requests for many different things and, er,you know, alright er, it we could, we could, if Alton Towers seemed to be what, er, all shareholders wanted er, perhaps we, we could consider that but, but, but we do have a number of a attractive products. Erm er your third point was about the balance sheet and I think I'd ask the finance director Yes we, we will give consideration to that of course erm Sorry, can I Apologies. Erm we will, course we will give consideration to erm a further issue which I think is what you were asking us to do. All that does, in effect, as you know is i i is reduce the unit price share price, it has no other effect erm a and I think it's purely cosmetic myself and nowadays I think a share price of around seven hundred P which is, er where the shares are currently hovering, is not e enormously disproportionate but of course we'll keep it under consideration. Erm and your last point was about, erm, er the number of directors and particularly er, outside directors, non-executive directors. Well all I can say is that, erm Sir Simon was being extremely modest when he said that the development of this company er, has been due er, entirely to the executive directors. That that isn't actually the case erm the non-executive directors have been enormously helpful in, er, the field of strategy in giving the executive advice er they play a very full er, role in the develop er m development of the company and erm they also er, keep the er executives, er, in order. Who would sack me? Ch chairman, I wonder if I may just add to that I'm sure you know that the Bank of England the Bank of England have made a very strong point that on balance there should be more non-executive directors than executive directors in the company and, er it is felt very strongly that to get a good mix of non-executive directors really does protect the shareholders' interests and, er I think we're very much following the lead, er, of the Bank of, of England, erm, in this particular respect. And I think that we are very lucky in the very high calibre of non-executive directors we've been able to attract. Name, sir. On Saturday afternoon last What? Your name! Oh sorry. , same as jam! Er, it's very difficult, yes you all laughed when I asked a question last year from over there to get a capital P in Pearson because you all laughed it took twenty weeks to get it in The Times, do you remember? Right. Now we've got a company secretary he is er, an F C I S Chartered Institute Secretaries that's much better than a chartered accountant, they're no damn good as secretaries, right! And the L L B people really they're not up to much, are they? Now this chap is supposed to have constructive commonsense forensic ability, what do we mean,the police? Affability to laugh off his twenty week delay in getting my capital P! Right. Now can we look at his pay cos you all been busy on the directors' pay and this chartered secretary is really important and so that he could be available on a Saturday afternoon if he was wanted. Well now, the problem you say it's emotional shall I say it was blasphemous, it was Rushdie. Now, erm, the situation there was that my vicar came to see me and, erm, what happened was that we've got three churches well luckily, one of them only has about twelve in it another has eighty and another sixty and he said well what did he do about Rushdie? And so well I didn't like what he was doing but at any rate it happened on Sunday morning er, somebody read the lesson and it was Saint, Saint John and there were chapters and of course it was skipping about the verses all over the place, you just got fed up with verses. Right he then went to the pulpit and he said that he was gonna preach about Lazarus actually but he's a quiet fellow and he shouted at the top of his voice I'm speaking about satanic bondage! Er, Mr Yes, is er that blasphemous? er,n what, what, er, er, I think you need to do is ask your question because er Oh right to have a narratable speech is not in order I'm so sorry. yes, yes right. Is erm do we know anything about Rushdie or anything? Another point is, up in Hull in October er, somebody wrote a book about Mahatma Ghandi and he got death threats so the vice chancellor of Hull University he's in Fenners he's a director of J H Fenners in industrial. So I suggest the secretary rings up the secretary of Fenners don't say you're listed in newspapers cos industrial people don't like that but have a word with Fenners and they'll tell you what's gone on. So, what is your question? The question is can a small shareholder do anything for Rushdie, am I doing damage for Pearson? I'm trying Mm. to help Pearson Mm. not pick it to bits over its directors' salaries. Er, well thank you for your offer of help it is, er i i i i it's er er clearly a very difficult issue, there are erm, there are important issues of principle er, in, er conflicting directions it is not an easy one and erm er er er I don't er, really know that there is anything er that, er any shareholder of Pearsons is able to do about it. Thank you. Are there any further questions? Thank you. Well I will now put the resolution to the meeting those in favour would they raise their hands thank you those against there is nobody so I can declare it carried unanimously. Thank you very much. Erm the next matter is the re-election of the retiring directors and a separate resolution is required for each one er I've asked Mr to propose the first resolution. I propose that Mr J H , a director, retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. Right. Thank you Mr . I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against? Thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Mr to propose Sir Simon . I propose that Sir Simon , a director retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. Put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Er Mr I propose that Mr , a director retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried. Mr . Er, I'd like to propose that Mr J C , a director retiring in accordance with article eighty of the company's Articles of Association be and is hereby re-elected a director of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Erm we now come to the appointment of the auditors and the question of their remuneration. Under the provisions of the Companies Act Nineteen Eighty Five their appointment er, requires the annual approval of the shareholders. I therefore propose that Coopers and Lybrand be and are hereby appointed auditors to the company, to hold office from the conclusion of this meeting until the conclusion of the next meeting er, of the company at which accounts are laid for the company in accordance with section two four one Companies Act Nineteen Eighty Five and that their remuneration for this period be fixed by the directors. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against? Thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Well, that concludes the business of the A G M and, er it's now twelve forty and er we can move straight on to deal with the business of the extraordinary general meeting. Erm you already had, er, the opportunity to read my letter of the eighteenth of April er, circulated with the report and accounts, which fully explains the proposals being put forward and which are for firstly increasing the authorized share capital of the company creating two new classes of preference share er, renewing the board's authority to allot shares renewing the board's power to modify preemption rights authorizing the company to purchase its own er, ordinary shares reducing the company's share capital by repaying the existing preference shares er, making certain amendments to the company's employee share schemes increasing the aggregate sum available for directors' fees and authorizing the company to issue summary financial statements. Erm I hope that the, er, circular er pretty fully explains er, these proposals but, er if there are er, questions er, I would be very pleased to answer them. Well, if there aren't any questions er, I would return to the resolutions, er, separately and I would propose the first one which is an ordinary resolution namely it's resolution one, set out in the notice of meeting to increase the authorized share capital of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against? I declare the resolution carried, it's an ordinary resolution. Erm secondly I propose a special resolution, resolution two, set out in the notice of the meeting to create and allot fifty thousand preference shares of U S dollars, a hundred er, each and a hundred billion er, preference shares of one pound each er, I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against? I declare the er, er special resolution er, carried. Erm I propose that ordinary resolution, resolution three set out in the notice of the meeting to grant authority to the board to exercise the powers of the company to allot ordinary shares er, this is an annual er, event I put the resolution to the meeting, those in favour any against? I declare the, er, resolution carried as an ordinary resolution. Erm next I propose as a, er, resolution four which is a special resolution and s set out in the notice of the meeting and is to modify to a limited extent, the obligations relating to the allotment of shares for cash contained in section eighty nine of the Companies Act. Er I put the resolution to the meeting, those in favour any against? I declare the resolution carried as a special resolution. Next resolution five which is an ordinary resolution er, set ou set out in the notice of the meeting which is to authorize the company to make market purchases of the ordinary shares of the company. This again is an annual. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution, er, carried er,as an ordinary resolution. Er resolution six is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting and is to reduce the company's share capital by repaying the five erm hundred and one thousand, three and a half percent cumulative preference shares of one pound, er, each at par. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour S I well I asked for questions before, Mr , but erm what is your question? Why is there a need, sir, to repay the five hundred and one thousand pounds of the three and a half percent cumulative pref shares it's quite a low interest involved. What a low interest share? Well this gives us the ability er, for a tidying up operation but the finance director will give more details. Thank you very much. It's helpful in the context of the dollar preference shares we want to issue because one of the factors of this very small, and as you say cheap er, historic issue of preference shares is that, er no preference shares other than those can be repaid prior to that and the dollar shares we wish to issue which are permanent shares, can be er, can be erm repaid at our option and we do want to keep that flexibility in the context of either if interest rates get very high or if the tax treaty between the U S and the U K changes to make them more onerous on the company and in those circumstances we would be inhibited by the existence of this small historic issue of preference shares and therefore it is on balance, although you're quite right there, a cheap er, source of capital in themselves it is helpful to the company in the wider sense I believe if they are repaid. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against declare the resolution er, carried as a special resolution. Er, next is resolution seven which is an ordinary resolution set out in the notice of the meeting, and it is to authorize the directors to amend the company's employee share schemes in the manner set out in the circular dated eighteenth of April nineteen ninety to members of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried as an ordinary resolution. Erm resolution eight er, set out in the notice of the meeting to increase the aggregate annual sum available for directors' fees to two hundred and fifty thousand pounds I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried as an ordinary re resolution. Erm finally, resolution nine which is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting er, and it's to alter the company's articles to enable the company to issue summary financial statements. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against thank you very much, I declare the resolution carried as a special reso resolution. Erm, that concludes the business of the extraordinary general meeting erm, thank you very much for attending and making it a lively meeting and, erm, my colleagues and I will be pleased to, erm meet you in the foyer er, where refreshments are being served. Thank you very much. long summer break. I just want you to remember the video, someone you don't know is a? Stranger. Right. You don't take sweets you to don't don't take drinks, presents money or Don't take anything. That's right, don't take anything. You don't get in someone's car cos someone you don't know is a? Stranger. What can one say? They know it already Miss. You've been here lots of times too haven't you. You told us before. I know I have, yes I know I have. been here loads of times. And we've watched, and we've watched the video before. Shh shh shh. And we've watched the video before, yes, and we keep learning and we keep coming to tell you don't we? Because it keeps happening, boys and girls in their summer holiday keep get getting taken away by people they don't know and nasty things done to them. So all we want you to do is remember the video remember Pippin yeah? And play safely till you come back to school next term. Play safe and never go with strangers. Strangers. Like James did. never. Like that James did, yes that little boy of three, James did didn't he? Two. Two or three whatever, I've just been Two corrected. Alright. Two. Who's James? Thank you Miss. Thank you. Will you do one thing before you go though class? Will you promise me when you go home tonight you be the teachers and your mum and dad be the children and you tell them all about Stranger Danger and you tell them you're never gonna go with strangers and see what your mum and dad says to you. Yeah, will you do that for me? Yeah. Well done. They don't live with me. Oh I always tell him that. Good man. Thank you very much indeed, thanks for your time. See you later class. Okay,le let's get started! We're, we're going to conclude now the discussion of the various ways in which, bacteria, in particular er lead to the production of infective disease and really to centre round, centres round the discussion of the pathogenesis, that is the mechanism by which the disease is produced and lunanspach. And I hope to run through today, basically, a set of examples of specific infective positions which show particular virulence factors er manifest themselves in terms of clinical disease. We start with er er a fine and exciting topic for Monday morning the topic of boils and in their finalist form they're shown here as starike. But, the sa the very same organisms responsible for that relatively moderate appearance can also produce blocked er region of Prince Charles, the carbuncle with which in it's most er florid form can break down and produce the series, but really effectively interconnecting . If we sample one of these cavities in which the process is er which produce boils er are going on, almost inevitably we find this organism staphylococcusorius and offspotulates have been clearly fulfilled with organism and this disease most notably by a bunch of of medical students who are subjected to all sorts of tortures by their professor of microbiology back in the nineteen fifties. And over the years it's been possible to identify a number of factors produced by these bacteria that seem to make sense in terms of the pathology and the conditions. Now the pathology is by a chief information and i in fact, the chief information could be provoked merely by the presence of organisms. You will, you will recognise from your immunology that the presence is certainly foreign antigenic materials can lead immediately to, to the acute alternatives. But, notable inside er the material that characterises the boils and abscesses, there is a cell death, both of bacteria and of the both the defending cells and the structural cells. And, to a very large extent tri cell death can be related to the ability of staph orius to produce elicit toxins, toxins which actually leave the cell death and . But the characteristic of this puss forming organism is that the legions it produces are wooled off, that is they're relatively localized. And although the er, the causal relationship is not completely established, it is a very helpful way of remembering that one of the principle distinguishing features of this organism which separates it from other members of the genus staphylococcus it pr it produces this enzyme to coagulate things on and the effects of this enzyme are illustrated here as against the control preparation, you see a clot form due to the action of this enzyme on clotting practice which has been put into this test tube serum. So this is almost certain a virulence factor but is also very useful in differentiating pathogenic species of staphylococci from non-pathogenic species. And, as as you'll be hearing in later er stages of the course there are many non-pathogenic species of staphylococci. It's worth also mentioning, since you saw it in the practical class, that staphylococci in general produce this enzyme catalase all of these er lo thi this is the enzyme which breaks down hydrogen peroxide and detoxifies it. All of these factors together lead us an to recognise as it a puss forming organism which is often recognised by the term hyogenic organism, ability to produce puss in er the form of reactions it initiates. Now I want at least, to intro introduce the possibility in the series of diagrams I'm going to show you in this lecture that we can relate it to the four stages of pathogenesis that we, we outline briefly er, in the last lecture. The first stage being the establishment, the next stage being penetration, the third stage being damage, what actually produces the damage in the disease, and the fourth stage is, if the disease is going to last for any period of time the ability of the organism to persist. I'm going to introduce this abbreviated momentictiture here in the hope that during the course of the lecture I'll be able to add comments about which of these factors lead to which of these results. Er, but if we run out of time and I find we haven't we we we can't fit it all in I'd like you all to attempt to do this for yourselves after er, the lecture is over. Okay? So, establishment for staphylococcusorius is often not an important feature because in the majority of infections we're talking about an endogenous infection, the organism was there in the first place. Penetration in many instances is not related to a property of the organism itself, in most instances it's re related to some form of injury in which the organism is moved from it's normal skin location to a deep tissue location. So we won't mention these factors here, although in in some instances er, these properties are important to talk about for staph orius. The damage, is fairly obvious to see is produced by these two and it's worth pointing out that persistence can be related to this catalase enzyme. Staphylococci have some degree of resistance to killing by phagocytes and yo you should recall that phagocytes er, one of the mechanisms by which phagocytes kill intercellular organisms is the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and catalase is one of the ways that these can detoxified and th there's fairly good evidence that the catalase enzyme enables er,staph orius to persist. Okay. So, that's, that's the first example of a very common condition. Let's move on now to consider a very important type of infection such as meningitis. You recognise by particularly common in children not recognised by the particular posture that they adopt and extended neck, rigid neck due to the inflammation of le , lymphees which I will resist being a reflection of the neck, completely rigidly. It's a disease which, if it a , they're fortunate enough to re , recover from the disease, if it's been severe enough the inflammation may have involved er, some of the cranial nerves, and here we can see a third nerve palsy er as a result of er, the process. If you take a sample er, of ce the cera cereblis fluid during the course of acute bacteria meningitis you will find it's drowning, drowning, not due the fact that it's an organism, but present, being due to the presence of puss cells. This is another biogenical fluid and, in about a third of the cases you will find this, very faintly with them Mm mm. which you can just about see here a in conjunction with the puss cells with which it is busily the life and death, life and death tackle. This organism is the fastidious grand negative rod you saw in the erm practical class innocuous influenzi. And it is a a very important pathogen responsible for about a third of the cases of meningitis in in this country almost exclusively in children. Now, the process we recognise in the pa pathogenesis of meningitis due to this organism is as follows, first of all and then it is able, by, mechanisms not completely described but we could probably involve this transpschycosis er phenomenon that er, I I briefly mentioned last time. First of all, penetrates from the into the bloodstream and then into the cerebral spinal fluid. Now the basis for the pathogenesis is not well enough established for us to expect you to understand the details of how it achieves these processes, but one thing which is remarkably clear is that the organism is a capsule producing organism and that once it gets into the er cerebral spinal fluid that predominately is an acute inflammatory . We do recognise establishment factors, that is adhesions in this part of the process and it is very clear that the capsule is one of the factors which allows the organism to pe , persist because it helps the organism to resist phagocytosis. You'll notice that the damage in this instance is actually the result of the acute inflammatory response, not particularly some form of direct noxious effect of the organism, so the contribution of the host is absolutely critical. Now, the reason we we focus on the capsule as illustrated on the right here is that hymophylus have many different capsular types, but but only one type appears to be associated with meningitis. This type B capsule refers to a particular pulse and has it's so important in the pathogenesis of the capsule that antibodies to it can be used er,ca , er can actually completely prevent the disease and we end up with a capsule vaccine based on the type B pulse . Plus, referencing with the other two organisms which produce meningitis in, in humans it is very prominent that both of these, licea meninigitipitus and staphylococcus are also very prominent capsule mechanisms. Hello! That's like the type. H I for hymopholus influenzi. And that's, that H I is actually the th th H, H I B is the acronym for the vaccine. There's a new vaccine introduced last October which is being er, used for the first time in this country to prevent meningitis in children. Is that just the name of the vaccine? H, well H I B is a, an abbreviation for the strain of hymopholus that produces the infection, but the name of the vaccine the H I B vaccine, yeah. Okay? I should say that a, a lot of this information will be covered again during this course, what I'm trying to do now is to bring together the the themes in a pathogenesis of infection that I introduced last week into the practical context of clinical infections. And to to, to try and illustrate to you why we focus on particular virulence factors for particular organisms. Move on now to to look at an area that's er not frequently er doesn't impinge a great deal on life in this country but it certainly does for travellers and for many people in the developing world. This is the topic of secretory diarrhoea produced by infective agents. This is a dramatic disorder of the small intestine which produces a massive outflow of water electrolytes that can be fatal within a matter of hours after the onset of disease! We recognise two agents which are er, responsible in bacterial causes of this process,th there are many others but these are certainly the most important. choleri, the cholera vacilus and er, an acronym here, ETEC, I wouldn't worry about taking down the full er, er , it actually stands for e entrotoxigenic ecolytes, it's a strain or a group of ecolars that are able to produce this effect. These diseases are common in areas er where an out pouring of water from the individual is squared up with a ou , out pouring of people into the water, then you can appreciate that that transmission is very er, readily promoted under those circumstances. The effects on the, the individual are very dramatic! Dehydration, er can produce death within a matter of fe , er a few hours and and an understanding of the mechanism by which this dehydration leads us into one of the most effective forms of heat treatment er, ever produced. A prominent feature of secretory diarrhoea is that effective and normal bowel in,yo you ca , you can ignore this sign are almost indistinguishable, so despite this dramatic change in the physiology of the small bowel, borthalogically it actually looks quite normal. And you have a normal meconium. Now, the organisms that produce this effect haven't, have this target which is around zero for the choleri , the villi of a small intestine and the both of these organisms have pro prominent adhesion mechanisms. Let's just show you something with that. In an affected small bowel you will see the grey background with these tiny little curved rods present the whole area of the er, the villi is covered by the organisms which are er stuck down effectively by the processes which you ca , you can't really see them in the transmission micrograph, but they are attached to specific receptors on the surface of the entrocite membrane. Once they've got there, the organism really goes no further. Both the cholera organism and the ETEC organism secrete toxins referred to here as C T for cholera toxin and LT for the le Lethane toxin. It is very striking that these toxins are actually almost exactly the same molecule! So that although these are er fairly different relatives in terms of bacteria it's striking that the ETEC organism has been able to acquire in some way almost exactly the same gene that's present in choleri. And, this toxin when released from these tightly organisms disorders the er the physiological activity of the lining cells, the empha cells. The molecular oh we've lost a slide! The molecular basis for this is very well understood and forms one of the important themes in er the effects of e , exotoxin in human cells. This toxin is composed of two components er, of binding components and active component. Binding component binds to specific receptors on the emphacyte and the active component penetrates into the cell and inactivates the controlling mechanism on the production of . And this is the cell that er, is possessed by several other toxins that affect, not just the gut but other parts of the body as well. I should point out that in one of the features of adhesions is that it takes two to tango, so to speak! Where specific adhesions are involved the the , the structures that are, are most commonly associated with a , require a specific receptor for the adhesion reaction to take place and that if the potential host doesn't have specific receptor they're not susceptible to that particular strain of organisms. Okay. Let's move on to look at another fairly dramatic infection which is a case of diphtheria. That, which is er a infection ca characterized by this profuse athema of th the base of the neck, referred to as bull neck if you look inside this child's er pharynx you see this very messy inflammatory process at the back and the whole of the respiratory mucosa is beginning to detach in what's referred to as a pseudo-membrane. In, fatal cases this pseudo- membrane can extend right from the top of the respiratory track here down into bronchi, and you can get these enormous casts of mucrotic material er, starting in the pharynx and working their way right down in the bronchi. It's been known for a very long time that from these cases you can isolate this organism C diphtheria bacterium which you saw in the practical classes and has this distinctive stayed property where er certain granules can be stayed up and also the arrangement of the cells is rather reminiscent of what called Chinese lettering. The picture, the acute picture which you've just seen is virtually exclusively due to the production of a toxin and that toxin produces really a necrotic pharyngitis inflammation of the pharynx associated with necrosis and detachment of what we call the pseudo-membrane. In very severe cases the toxin gets into the blood stream and their paralytic effects toxin i i is to some extent a neuro-toxin, and also there are effects of the heart. So although for the majority of cases that a fatal as a result of diphtheria the fact that , due actually to the pharyngitis and the pseudo- membrane obstructing the respiratory passage. In later stages, the minority of cases may go on to produce these results. Well this is a disease due to another exotoxin which, in practical terms is of importance to you because it's the basis for a test for identifying the . The toxin may or may not be present in strains of er C diphtheria and this is just an immunological test so I wo won't explain it in detail but what you can see is a a strip of er, filter paper which has been bathed in anti-toxin and growth of various different strains of the organism erm which, some of which do produce the toxin you can see lines of precipitation here and some of which don't produce the toxin. And that test has to be applied to es each eyslate because this toxin is not part of the genome of Cherani bacteria diphtheria, it's actually a farged mediated toxin, it's actually encoded for by a bacteria farged. So when What's paresis then? Paresis, paralysis. Oh! I thought you were doing neuro-sciences course? The as I said this, this is required for identification for the organism, but the to the toxin has been recognised for a very, very long time and right from er, the early days the possibility of inactivating the biological properties of a toxin while retaining their immunological properties has been attractive to people seeking to prevent these diseases. And, if you treat this toxin with something like formaldehyde or ethanol, you end up by inactivating it's toxic properties and you end up with what, what we call a toxoid, something that retains immunological properties, it's able to stimulate specific immunity to the toxin but it doesn't have any of the toxic effects and we end up with this toxoid vaccine against diphtheria. And all of you, I would expect, have received the toxoid vaccine against diphtheria. Curiously it has led effectively to the irradification of Cherani bacterium diphtheria from the circulating respiratory flora in this country and the reasons for that are are quite obscure! Another im prominent toxoid vaccine which you should all have received and be regularly receiving boosters for is the tetanus vaccine, and really, a very similar situation pertains here, that the toxin is so important in the pathogenesis of disease, tetanus, that simply immunity to that one factor can lead to immunity er to the disease as a whole. So, I've gone through a series of examples of exotoxins I want to just er, as far as is possible summarize the general properties of exotoxins. First thing to be said about them is that they're all proteins covering a very wide range of molecular weights between three and three hundred kilobocals three thousand to three hundred thousand bocals. And they have very specific impacts because they all result their effective result on an interaction with a specific receptor and er an activity I would express on that receptor or as a result of the er erm the uptake of the toxins. Consequently,. As I've indicated before you can divide them into patha and physiological effects and membrane damage more specifically than what I said before membrane damage is the i i is a particularly important thing. Your patha and physiological toxins are often sub-unital structure and they make the most, the momegictiture most widely used is an A plus B sub-unit structure. The B is a receptor and A is often, although by no means always, an enzyme and in the case the cholera toxin rotusis toxin and several other erm pseudo-membrane toxins and several others, diphtheria toxin they have the specific A viral I think they put the group onto a target molecule and disorder itself . The membrane doesn't use toxins like the lytic toxins that staphylococcusorius expressed er they're often detected by their immunelytic properties, see the in the er, in the bacterial passage. I'm sure you've experienced in many instances here, the effect of lytic toxins in er a boil or some some other unpleasant minor lesion! Gonna go on now to talk about a severe condition which may start out that with a minor skin rash like this, this is called a petechial skin rash they later progress to rather more generalised rash and in it's most severe form it's mucrotic effects on the skin and er, obviously a lethal outcome! This type of picture is almost exclusively related to the isolation of grand negative organisms from the blood, these may be phacili or cocci, doesn't really make any er, any difference. It's the grand nega negative cell wall structure that seems to matter. And we now know that these ghastly effects are the results of what we referred to in the last lecture endotoxins. You will hear in considerable detail in a later lecture about how septic shock and endotoxin work. At this stage it's worth remarking that wa there are perhaps three prominent features of endotoxin effects first of all, they promote physcocine release and th the the two pro , prominent phsycocines affected are I O one, Interlooping one and TMF, tumourmacrosis factor which I hope you heard about in the immunology course. I O one is the molecule most closely associated with the mi , the effects of lodose endotoxin and that is fever I O one er, when released into the blood sys bloodstream affects the hypothalamus and th i one of the principle reasons why infective conditions lead to fever. In more severe situations there's uncontrolled continent acto activation and uncontrolled clotting factor, activation and it's really that last feature that's particularly responsible for the er er ghastly skin disease you saw i in the last sla , in the previous slide! Now the eff the endotoxin as I've is almost exclusively associated with the grand negative cell wall. And again in abbreviated form that, I just want to take you through the molecular basis for endotoxin action. Here is the positive wall with it's large er expansive petroglycan grand negative with an inner and an outer membrane, and the petroglycan sandwiched in between. Here we have a diagram of a grand negative organism with it's inner membrane and outer membrane illustrated here. Very easy to reproduce endotoxic shock in in experimental animals and er, it was found fairly early on that the effects, er the endotoxic effects were almost exclusively associated with the outer membrane. And detailed chemical strains of the outer membrane show that it has a slightly different structure from normal unit membranes. Expand that up, you'll end up with a normal inner leaflet to the membrane, a phospholipids but the outer the , er the outer layer is almost exclusively composed of this stuff, lycropolysacrulite I mentioned this in an earlier lecture but we need to go into in a little bit more detail . This lycropolysacrulite is can then be broken up into three different sections the internal membrane section is referred as lipid A. Lipids in general are not very antigenic erm er it's interesting to note that lipid A, when it's purified from the other components is almost totally responsible for the toxic amount of any property. The polysacurised component of composed of a four region to which the lipids are attached, and that outer region is er, it extends out into the environment . Now, the importance here is that both of these polysacrulite components are based in general the outer region is highly variable, that's to say that very, er that most of organisms possess a unique outer region to that polysacrulite . And by contrast, the poor region, certainly amongst the grand negative bacilli is very similar across a wide range of different species and this provides a very important opportunity to produce immunity to endotoxin directed against the core and this possibility has recently been exploited by a production of the molecule antibody directed against the core polysacride of the erm er er, of ecoli. So, this has been shown to be effective in moderating the toxic events which occur in grand negative shock. Building on this approach and something which I think you'll see certainly during the course of your your medical studies antibodies directed against tumourler proce , tumourler process factor are now being used to try and interrupt the chain of events at a slightly later stage. So that's that's the endotoxin story. I want now just to summarise and er some of these the features I'm going to point out I've I've already stated so you may may just want to sit back and just take this in. If we compare endo and exotoxins endotoxins are only associated with grand negative organisms whereas exotoxins maybe produced by either grand negative or grand positive. Endotoxins are exclusively cell associated in their production. Exotoxins may also be cell associated, they've, they may not be a sa , they're not a structural component, but, particularly in grand negatives exotoxins er, are released first into the peraplasmic space, the space between the two membranes, and the the actual release into the medium er, may require cell . So,tha they are both cell associated and cell free. Endotoxin from different organisms although it may be of of different potency has essentially the same biological effects. So, a wide variety of different organisms can produce endotoxic shock. But exotoxins from different organisms produce really very different biological effects. Even, even though they may be er,the they may work as a result of different o of the same enzyme activity in some cases the target for that enzyme activity and the receptors that have put it into the specific cells that are targeted lead to really very different biological effects. In general terms endotoxins are a very low potency about point O one of a gram is lethal to one person some exotoxins are incredibly potent, and they're being the, the subject of er a certain amount of er weapons research. The same goes for O one of a gram for example,toxin and it gives you a hundred thousand er as as I've indicated here, there's a, a wide range for the potency. Endotoxins are heat stable, and this is very important when we try to produce why I will not be able to support this amendment, but the first is that the leader of the council has indicated that the efficiency savings erm has got as far as it can go and that, you know, we have been trimming at the margins and there is no more margin left and that leads you to believe that perhaps one should be looking at somewhat more er root and branch type of pruning in the spending that that the labour group want to actually erm deal with, er and the second point I would like to make, and er I thank councillor for giving us a a a a new word tonight obfuscation because that describes exactly what I think the labour group are trying to do by bringing this figure down it removes the embarrassment they would have from having to add on a substantial sum of money f due to the failure to collect the cou er the community charge in previous years and I think that they are trying by by this amendment with some very quick foot work to try and delude the people of this city. Mr Mayor, councillor says that the labour group is running the council, that's manifestly not the case. The conservative group is running the council. And the conservative group is running the council in the sense that labour has scrambled, obviously over the last few days, to reduce its tax level to something closer to the tories and I'm going to stand with my fellow liberal democrats tonight and vote for a higher figure because, not only because I think that there's sort of things we want to do in our budget, are b are b are better and and would be better done than not done, but because I think there's a fundamental political ethical issue here and it's one which has been confronting this country for a great many years and which is going to be crucial in the next election. The question is, do the people of Britain believe in paying higher taxes for good services delivered by central and local government? I thought that progressives, political progressives in this country were prepared to stand by public services and believe in them sufficiently to say this will cost you and we are prepared to to put the bill to you because we believe you will pay the bill. What we have tonight is a labour group that says they no longer believe in that philosophy. What they believe in is that everybody out there is out to grab as much as they can for their own private interest and they're prepared to meet them halfway on that. There's no question who's running the council here, it's this lot. Reference to I think that last comment is of course a very interesting one . I thought the liberal democrats failed abysmally at that the last election. Can you say Mr Ashdown may have all the qualities of leadership except . And I suspect that the next election that will still prevail. But clearly the liberal democrats have not learnt the lesson of spending what you have and running prudent budgets. Even president Clinton is learning that, even as a democrat he had a reputation of fiscal responsibility as a government, but I must admit I welcomed his present er proposals in that regard. But that doesn't follow for the liberal democrats in this particular council. I don't think their proposals in that regard will be worthy of support. Er, but councillor other remark about the labour party moving towards the conservatives is of course a very fair one, but then surely nothing surprises us at the moment about the labour party. At long last they've come out in favour of wealth, isn't that extraordinary, reported in today's paper. They're also, Mr Mayor, interestingly coming out in favour of the individual but I must admit I applaud that and at long last in some, admittedly very modest way, er they are moving, I won't say to fiscal responsibility, but at least they're learning the lessons of the recklessness of the past of their policies. But what we have to bear in mind of course er the f financial propriety of this council would in a sense have been very easy over the years if the labour party previously had trimmed its budget according to what we could all afford. That they did not do and now the leader of the council said well they're trying to get down to the standard spending assessment at last, he could have done that a long time ago, you have had nothing but excess expenditure proposals on behalf of this city for many, many years. If we are above government guidelines it is the labour party's fault and if indeed we are penalised in the future it is the labour party's fault, none other and to the extent that you run the risk now by having this excess eleven percent budget over the er standing expenditure assessment er will once again unfortunately find you guilty in that regard. What I did find very distressing in his remarks, er were basically in respect of some of the savings . Again I must say it seems extraordinary doesn't it that er he pontificates the savings when really one is entitled to ask the question well why weren't they made before? I really can't think that you can claim those as savings. They're a pulling back of your excess expenditure. They are if you like a correctness of mismanagement. It can't be anything else, formal savings is not on and I think when you small items I was rather distressed by some of them. I think we're going to go as a council in the direction of not answering letters on time. In business that cost is one of the first items you do in efficiency terms. If you delay the answering of letters, of course that creates more letters chasing up the first ones and that is again where you are getting your priorities wrong, admittedly on a very small items. For the leader of the council to use the excuse in terms of savings about the cost of the burning of the dead. I think most of us have due respect and regard for proper procedure in that regard. One of the most emotional times for anyone. For you to downgrade that and say well I'm sorry now we're doing all this, we can't guarantee that, it's disgraceful, absolutely disgraceful. What I actually said was that the price that we would have to charge for burying the dead had to go up in order to ensure that in of the circumstances our standards could remain impeccable. That I regard as unfortunate . I'm very glad you clarified that Mr because certainly I not as I heard it er and I'm very pleased that was clarified and I think others would have felt likewise. Let me come on, let me come on then to a more disgraceful excuse er that er the leader of the council talked about. He talked about the stress on the people we employ. Most of us who've been on this council some years will have seen the stress that the labour party brought on a number of senior officers who felt obliged to leave in what I would call distressing circumstances. That was the pressure of the labour party policy and if there is any stress on staff in this council then it is at your responsibility. You are running this council and it up to you to ensure that you do not create employ because if that is what you're admitting to you're Councillor you've had over your time Thank you very much well I've been very pleased to make those points relating to the leader of the council. Since there are no further hands rushing up into the air I'll say a few words myself. Asking I think the proposals the labour group's . It's important that we look at the pattern of our spending as a local authority over the past five or six years. But that in some of the comments that have gone before. In those days the government assessed local authority needs according to a very in the grant related expenditure assessment, G R E A, greas and this is much more complex and sensitive measure of how much it costs to run a city and in those days what the government thought we should be spending and what we thought we should be spending seemed in fact to be very close indeed. In nineteen eighty seven, eighty eight, we spent ninety nine point eight eight percent of what the government thought . In nineteen eighty eight and eighty nine we spent ninety eight point two nine percent and in eighty nine ninety, ninety seven point one four percent of what the government thought we need we actually underspent in their terms. This was still a labour council, they were still a conservative government but there was a wonderful consensus about the spending needs of local authorities and how local authorities should be funded. That was what one might call a pre-poll tax consensus. In nineteen ninety one the S S A was introduced as the measure for assessing local authority needs and in that year our spending, instead of being one or two percent below what the government thought, it shot up to forty nine point nine five percent above the S S A figures. What had happened? Had labour suddenly become a local authority, or did the S S A simply fail as an accurate way of assessing our spending needs? The answer I think, lies in the fact that the government next year gave this authority an increase in its S S A of some thirty two point one percent, one of the largest increases in the country. Not quite enough perhaps but still enough to be an admission that they got it seriously wrong in the year before. Since that point though what has been the pattern of our budgets? Have we kicked against the and ignored the determination of central government to bolster their own problems with the P S B I by reducing local authority spending? No, from that figure of forty nine point nine five percent above S S A in nineteen ninety one we proposed a budge that had brought reductions year on year in that divergence of view. Each and every year there have been reductions. In nineteen ninety one the gap narrowed to thirty one percent from almost fifty nine. In ninety two, three it narrowed further to twenty two percent and this year we're proposing a budget that is only ten point eight percent adverse to the government's figures. We don't believe that the government is correct in their view of what the city needs. But we've not wilfully put at risk services or jobs by risking capping by going in the opposite direction. Equally we've tried not to traumatise the public or our staff by cutting back to the governments preferred level all at once. Our view is that the people of this city value the services the council provides and don't want them withdrawn. Ours has been a process of careful pruning year on year. It's not been without pain and I pay tribute to our staff's willingness to embrace the changes that we've had to make. In particular I think it should be recognised that the role of the unions, NALGO and G M D in helping that process of change has been quite fundamental and for that reason, because we appreciate and value the essential way in which the unions have contributed to the process of changing the organisation I consider that the they much trailed proposals from the opposition groups to cut, or in the other case, to reduce the NALGO office are quite misguided . I want to return however to the question of the pattern of taxation in the authority under labour control. It's of course only to be expected that people should moan about the tax they've got to pay and people always complain that it seems to go up every year. Well let me say quite clearly now, that is not true. Both as a percentage of budget and in real terms accounting for inflation, people are being asked to pay less today than they were in nineteen eighty eight. In eighty eight, eighty nine the rates, business and domestic, amounted to eighty one point seven percent of all the council's spending. The government contributed just eighteen point two percent so the bulk of our expenditure was born by local people directly. Today we're asking local people to pay only fifty seven percent instead of eight two. But politicians always speak in terms of percentages and real terms so let's look at the total tax which was demanded from people in the city in the past few years. In nineteen ninety, ninety one we asked for six point four seven four million in poll tax. In ninety one ninety two, five point four. In ninety two, three by point six seven and in the budget we propose tonight we've asked for four point five five million. No no allowing for inflations, no underlying trends under the labour proposals people in Cambridge will be paying less hard cash now than they did eight years ago. The council is spending prudently and efficiently and it's spending as little hard cash as is compatible with meeting the essential needs of the people who live in the city. I'm told I've got to wind up I have the discretion to give myself up. But you'll be relieved to know I'm not going . In that case Councillor has . Can we move to the vote then please on the amendment before us I proposed to take it. As point of order I believe as this is a proposal of an amendment of the city board city board is the city board chair's right of reply. Do you wish to exercise your right to reply? Very, very briefly indeed erm I would stand by what I said in my overall speech. I do think that the Erm, it doesn't matter what I propose, whether it actually makes out things that they've been talking about or whether it's completely found something to criticise about it. That's politics. What we've actually got here is a judicious budget proposal which yes, has changed over the last fortnight, I make no apologies for that. It also has to hinder to recognition of what the needs of the people of the city are and I actually cast out, wipe out services and the needs of central administration which is essential to any council and I would hope that not only my own back this amendment. Thank you. Can I ask us to to move the amendment erm in one A those in favour of that part of the amendment please show one A. What are we voting on? from the housing committee and nine thousand pounds from the environment committee were the following additional savings. Roman numeral one, those in favour please show. Those against please show. Roman numeral two please show in favour Thirty two. And those against roman numeral three, those in favour please and those against right. In B add at the end roman numeral one, those in favour please show . Thirty one Mr Mayor. And those against roman numeral two those in favour and those against roman numeral three those in favour and those against amendment D to read one two to eight O O nine please in that budget to thirty six three eight nine fifty, those in favour. Thirty two. And those against. In three alter the amounts calculated to read as follows, I hope that we can take that block in three as one since it all follows from what's gone before. Yes we have erm those in favour thank you, and those against okay thank you. Are there further amendments? Thank you councillor . Okay councillor can you proceed? Does everyone have a copy of this one good er Mr Mayor erm all budgets are a balance between er spending on database services and spending on capital projects and on keeping taxes down. All three elements have to come in to any budget decision and nobody can ignore all three, indeed if you look around three groups of the council you'll see that all the budget proposed tonight will take into account all three areas. Conservative budget for example even though its main press is always on keeping the tax level down er will often include capital projects. For example they support the market square project and at the end of the day even with the total budget down to S S A the vast bulk of the money being spent by conservative budget's been spent on people salaries but it's still being spent on services and the labour party this year has lost the three elements keeping the tax down and that's quite a good thing to see. Though I should say that what councillor said that my group were prepared to set a higher tax level if that were necessary. That's what we said at the general election. By my judgement as the amendment reflects is that it isn't necessary but if it were I would have no hesitation s whatsoever in increasing the level of taxation to pay for what needs to be paid for. It needs to be understood that what divides the parties isn't so much that one party believes in capital projects, on party in revenue spending and one party in keeping the taxation levels down. What divides them is solely of judgements on the bounds between those three elements. I should say that for us revenue services, ordinary database services do come first keeping the tax level does come second and the prestige projects, even rather good ones like the market square project definitely come third. It's not to say that we are against capital projects, we are not. We have included in our proposal this year twenty thousand revenue effects of a hundred thousand pounds capital bid on traffic calming and other similar measures, something which is very popular around the city, as long as you ask people what they want first and which in previous years we put forward as a revenue bid. We decided the best way to deal with that question is through a capital bid and that's what we've done. And also of course there is the question of Parkside Pool although observant members of the council will notice that Parkside Pool isn't mentioned in our amendment. That is because, fortunately I suppose,our Parkside modernisation scheme we are reliable informed by officers, would have no revenue effects in ninety three, ninety four. It would have revenue effect of course in ninety four, ninety five and our future budget will have to reflect that. But in this year the first year of the project, because it will be towards the end of the year anyway it has no revenue, net revenue effect. the basic day to day problems that we want to concentrate on and on the challenges it faces. Education fund is in there we've not raised the price but that is our top priority and we believe it's societies top priority also in our amendment is our idea for extending concessionary bus fares for journeys within the city to those of school age who do not quality for the statutory schemes run by the county. The idea there is to try to get some reduction, some reduction in the level of traffic at peak hours and to help public transport. And of course in a scheme like that many details have to be worked out especially in negotiations with the bus company for the figure we have put in is I think a realistic figure for the first year of the scheme. We also want to bring about improvements in some well appreciated services. Services the council provides which we think could benefit from extra resources. The example of this of course is the night time call out service, which all parties support, which comes every year as a problem of funding, do we want a full week service? And we do, the question is can we afford it and we think we can. These services of course have to be paid for and we do aim to keep the level of taxation as low as possible but of course we can't aim to bring it down as far as conservatives would want because we need, we in the city need, to spend money on things like the education fund without which it becomes a city less worth living in. But we are looking f for savings to make greater efficiencies and we think we've found some. I'm gonna start with the support for trade unions small item twenty six thousand pounds to the NALGO project, there's a G M B budget but that's all nearly all paid for out of direct services we don't want to touch that. This county pays for a full time union official this is extravagant, one full timer for five hundred members, that is way over the top let me tell you. I'll give you one example the union of communication workers for the post office has one full time worker, one full time officer for two to three thousand. So we propose to cut that support by half in this year and to keep it under review for future years as well. Because we want to see a review of the whole system of union representation within the council to see whether it's an appropriate sort of representation for an organisation of this size. We are not against unions, we are for unions, unions can be very useful not only for their members but also for the management, we recognise that. The amount of money put in by the public. I would say to you you've already spent seven minutes of your time erm now allow you seven minutes in initially also and so Well St Aldate's in the Civil War is quite a problem to talk about really, erm in half an hour, because it's so enmeshed in the story of Oxford in the Civil War which is a long, very interesting one, so what I'm going to try and do is erm to pick out some of the local landmarks that did survive in the 17th century and relate them to what we know about some of the people and in this short half an hour, just try and picture what it was like to live in St Aldate's during the civil war. Obviously a whole lot else is . I think it's quite important to orientate ourselves first, and you're looking at a map of Oxford in 1643, erm and 17th century maps for the most part are what we should call upside down. The north is at the bottom, and I think it helps if you stop thinking about it as a map and you think about it as a birds-eye view, a helicopter view, erm and then the whole thing begins to make sense. erm Now, what you've got there is a slightly later map of 1675, which is exactly the same, the north is at the bottom, I'm afraid the top is not very obvious, if I could just hold it up, you've got the castle there, and you've got it the right way up, and actually there's some writing as well. erm And the reason I've given you that one is that that was drawn in 1675 by David Loggen, and it's a very, very accurate one, and it's rather easier to see some of the places I shall be talking about, so I think it's a nice one for you to have close up. erm There are some little differences which are quite interesting too. Now, if we find Carfax first in the middle, Oxford's on the crossroads principle, like so many cities, we've got St Giles down here, erm and Oxford of course a small city, or we should regard it as a very small city. It was still a walled city, the walls were all virtually intact, the castle was a bit ruinous, but it was there, and it had its four main gates, erm East Gate on the important London Road going out past Magdalen and over Magdalen Bridge, erm the North Gate here, the Westgate by the Castle, and then still existing then but not in your map if you can find it, the South Gate across the road, just at the bottom of Christchurch, can you find Christchurch on your map? erm Now, perhaps you can that there's a difference in Christchurch on your map with this one. When Cardinal Wolsey fell, he hadn't finished the building of Tom Quad, the whole of this side was left open because he'd planned a very grand perpendicular chapel like King's College Chapel, and erm the ruins, well no, not the ruins, the foundations were still to be seen apparently in the 17th Century John Gomley tells us. But it was open, I mean it must have been fenced in some way later on. erm But there was this great gap and I think had the civil war not come, the dean of Christchurch who was the first of the two Fells, would have probably finished that building then. As it was it was finished, as you can see on your map, after the war, erm but perhaps you can also see that Tom Tower is not yet built on yours. That wouldn't come till the 1680s. Now St Aldate's was a long narrow parish. It didn't quite reach up to Carfax, and it had another great landmark, as well as the big, rich college of Christchurch, and that was the Guildhall, built at the centre of the civic power, which was more or less, well, just where the Town Hall is now. It had 2 big inns, and we're more or less, well, we are on the site of the first one, Blue Boar Inn, and on your map, rather strangely, it seems to be built across the opening of Blue Boar Lane, I don't know if you can see. erm Anyway, it's just about there, and then, almost next door, presumably in competition with each other is the other inn, the Unicorn Inn, erm so that was it just on the South Side of Blue Boar Lane. erm One very important house is erm what is now the Newman Mobray Bookshop, and that of course is still very much as it was in the 17th Century. It belonged to an extremely important erm civic family, Thomas and John Smith, who are the two important ones during the civil war, Thomas was mayor just before the War, John Smith was a member of parliament in the Long Parliament, and erm there's a slightly complicated story to the house, Thomas moved out of it just before the war and built another one way up the street, but John stayed there, and another important landowner in Marston, Umpton Croak, owned the other half of it. If you go down to Newman Mobray, and walk down that little alleyway, Rose Place, you see what is the frontage of that house, and it's very fine, and you can tell these are important people building themselves a fine house. erm And I've got a picture in here somewhere , which I'll pass round. erm And also, the Alice Shop? Do you know where I mean? erm Well, that too, is a 17th century building, I've got a an early 19th century Butler engraving of it here, and some pictures from the Alice shop itself, Now that was owned by a Walter Paine, both these citizens were well off brewers, erm those are just pictures of the same one, it's a little bit of a problem because this is called the house belonging to the manciple of Christchurch. I think in fact that's a mistake from,a mistaken caption. Manciples were like college bursars, and they were very important. I'm rather advertising this because I think it's important to understand that although, and I'm sure you know, that there's this constant war really between, it wasn't of course a physical war, but certainly tension, and difficulty between the university and the city. erm I think it's important not to see the city as a sort of down-trodden, poor,hard-working, well, I'm sure they were hard-working, but very poor people. We're talking about two powerful organisations, both trying to keep their privileges intact. erm Undoubtedly the university often won, but that didn't stop the city keeping on trying. erm And I think one other citizen should be mentioned, erm which is one John Nixon. He didn't actually live in St Aldate's, but he must have been here a lot, because he was mayor in 1636, he was an alderman erm he was very much a leading in the city, and I think the leader of the opposition to Royal Policies. erm And erm when he came back after the war, he actually was so much involved on the parliamentarian side he had to leave Oxford during the war, but when he came back he built a school in the city which was actually in the Guildhall courtyard, it was built round the courtyard, and that remained a free school, for the city's boys right up to the end of the 19th century. Right, now, we've talked about very briefly, touched on the division between university and the city, and obviously the erm differences between the King and Parliament exacerbated what happened in the city. That's a complicated story I can't really go into at the moment, but was very much to do with the Royal Policies of the 1630s. Am I blocking your view? No. erm This is quite an interesting cartoon, and really has no connection with either St Aldate's or Oxford, erm but it was actually published in 1642, and it shows the two sides, the Roundheads and the Cavaliers, and what I think is interesting about it is that it does seem to be quite objective, it doesn't seem to be particularly getting at one side or the other, which is very rare for the kind of erm cartoons that were later issued during the war. And I've really just put it up erm because erm this is a complicated story but, one does want to be careful I think about seeing the sides as too neat. erm Undoubtedly the university erm with it's connections with the aristocracy and the landed gentry and the church was mainly royalist, but that is not to say that it all was. One college, New Inn Hall, completely emptied during the war, because erm they were on parliament's side. erm The warden of Merton had to get out of Oxford quick when the king arrived, because, and spent the erm war in London, name was Nathaniel Brent, and he was quite an important man in the organisation of the Parliamentary war effort, and Lincoln had rather mixed loyalties, too. So even University wasn't completely on one side, and again the City was erm there was this sort of Puritan element that didn't like the King's religious policies, erm there was this general feeling against the University which tended to put them off to the other side, but there are undoubtedly loyal citizens erm citizens loyal to the King. And Thomas and John Smith, who I've just mentioned were actually a split family, Thomas Smith was erm so loyal that when the first round of parliament, sorry, when the first Royalist troops came into Oxford, he, as a J P prosecuted some of the citizens who tried to stop them blocking down Botley Bridge as a defence measure. Whereas John Smith, a member of the Long Parliament actually was beaten up by those same Royalists troops, so erm because of his parliamentary sympathies. erm But he seems to have played things rather cool later on, he disappears at the beginning of the war but comes back into Oxford, and then later, actually sits in the Royalist Parliament,1644, which he certainly wouldn't have done if he was still on parliament's side. erm And I think really most citizens, and I daresay, a number of the scholars in the university too, were rather more interested in keeping their heads down, and erm just trying to keep out of it, and where the citizens were concerned, keeping on earning a living. erm And I think that's an important thing to remember while we're thinking about what happened in St Aldate's. Well undoubtedly the first thing that happened in St Aldate's, the most important thing, was after the battle of Edgefield, when the King rode in in state erm in victory he said, though the fact that the battle was indecisive,and it was described by a very royalist writer Anthony Wood, you may have heard of, is a university antiquarian erm very much on the university and royalist side. ‘They came in their full march into the town with about 60 or 70 coloureds borne before them which they'd taken at the Battle of Edgehill from the Parliament's forces. At Christchurch the university stood to welcome His Majesty.’ Well he doesn't bother to mention that the king also had an official welcome at Carfax, which was the normal place, what was known as the Penniless Bench, which was at the end of St Martin's Church, only the of that remains at the moment, now, erm and then was presented with the traditional gift of gloves by the mayor, and the not very generous sum of £520, and just about the same time, Alderman Nixon and 12 others who agreed with him disappeared smartly from Oxford, and weren't to be seen for the rest of the war. Now the King chose Oxford for pretty obvious reasons as his headquarters, he'd lost London, he needed a capital and a headquarters, erm and erm Oxford had a delightfully convenient central position, its transport is very easy with the river erm navigable, erm on both sides of it. Easy to defend, with its walls still existing, and the two rivers, and of course, with resources, with fuel and war effort, and the kind of buildings where the king could form a court. And the best building, though it's not technically part of St Aldate's, was the one he obviously chose as his fort, which was Christchurch. So court dominates St Aldate's throughout the war, and I think therefore we should spend just a little time looking at the people involved, erm but not too much. This of course is erm one of the famous Van Dyck portraits of Charles before the war, painted in 1636. Painted for a bust to be made, so that's why we have the three views, but I think it's very lucky, it means we can sort of walk round Charles, and get our own view of him. And perhaps Van Dyck doesn't flatter him in quite the way, flatter's the wrong word, sort of transmutes him in the way that he often does in his very elegant and sophisticated portraits. Well, Charles immediately set up the kind of court that he'd had in London as far as he could, with a very set routine. He had his two elder sons with him, he had quite a lot of time for enjoyment, certainly to start with, he went hunting round Woodstock quite often, and they played tennis, The erm Racquet Sport, and I think they played tennis in The Racquet Sport, I'm not absolutely certain, was actually just erm facing onto Blue Boar Street, erm behind the Unicorn Inn. erm They had great services were held in Christchurch Cathedral, and the King would have looked out from the Deans House, and this is the view of Tom Quad, a modern view, of course, of how you can look out onto the Great Quad of Christchurch, but of course it wasn't like that. erm Tom Tower wasn't there, the elegant pool in the middle wasn't and in fact the whole thing was probably rather chaotic. We know for instance that quite often erm pillaged flocks of cows and sheep were driven into the quad as one of the few open spaces within the city walls. Anthony Wood gleefully recalls this. erm So I think you want to regard it not as a sort of glamorous place where the troops were drilling and the drums were beating, but a slightly chaotic and rather dirty place, despite the kings existence. Another person the people in St Aldate's would have seen was the kings nephew, Prince Rupert, erm only 23 but one of the King's major assets, a brilliant cavalry commander. This is painted just before the war, and it's interesting to compare it with a painting by the court painter, William Dobson who worked in Oxford during the war, his studio was just around the corner in the High Street, because that's Rupert very much at the end when things were going badly wrong for him, erm and it's unfinished, perhaps because Dobson was beginning to run out of paint, and the experts at allow, and I think just that face tells the whole story about tension and unhappiness, Dobson's an interesting painter, one of the first English painters who sort of get to the top in this way, and he painted a lot of the cavaliers at Charles' court, erm this is Sir John Byron who clattered down the main street at St Aldate's, before the king even arrived before the Battle of Edgehill, the one that caused trouble for John Smith, erm and he was very much a swash-buckling character, but he didn't spend a lot of time in Oxford later, but he was there enough to have his portrait painted. That black mark is erm a scar patch, if you got a scar during the war you got a wound in a scuffle erm you won in the war, you did sort of emphasise this in that way. And so Charles Cockshall, who is the owner of court out to the north of Oxford, who is the King's master of ceremonies, and I think that's an interesting contrast, because here again you get this feeling of tension, and sadness. erm There was a great deal of difficulty I think at the court, as well as the rather glamorous exterior. erm The Queen didn't arrive till 1643, she'd been in the Netherlands raising money for the war effort, very successfully, because she finally came to Oxford with 2,000 foot and 1,000 horsemen, and erm a hundred wagons full of equipment as well as cannons and so on. I don't know if it all came to Oxford, but certainly most of it did, and erm the city council actually spent six shillings and sixpence strewing the streets with flowers to welcome her, which erm when we have a look at the amount of money that was being, having to be raised elsewhere it was quite generous really. And she got the pair of gloves as usual at the Penniless Bench. erm Then she came down to Christchurch and was welcomed by the heads of the university, her husband had already greeted her outside Oxford, on the site of , actually, and then Charles escorted her to her own household in Merton College. I think she undoubtedly added to the intrigue erm and difficulties of her court, erm one example, she was always getting people that she approved of, getting them plum jobs, and one example was one of the governors of Oxford, the most unpopular, one Sir Arthur Aston, who was so unpopular that he got attacked on the street, and then had to have a body guard paid for the city council, and then was curvetting on his horse in front of some ladies, and fell off and broke his leg so badly that he had to have it amputated, so from then on he had a wooden leg, erm that meant he had to stop being governor, and later on in the war, a countryman was coming into Oxford, and asked the sentinel ‘who was governor still’, and by that time a friend of prince Rupert's Sir William Leg was governor, and the answer was ‘one Leg’, and the countryman's reply was ‘pox on him, is he governor still?’. (Aston). erm I think two people have had tremendous problems and again must have been going up and down St Aldate's, because they were very busy officials, was Edward Hyde, who later became Earl of Clarendon and wrote his story of the war, again of course from the Royalist point of view, and his great friend, Lord Falkland, who was Secretary of State for the King, and became so upset and worried by the rash policies of the Queen's party and the general atmosphere of intrigue, and by the war itself, that he does seem to have more or less committed suicide at the battle of Newbury, by riding ahead of his troops into the enemy. And erm Edward Hyde wrote an elegiac mourning comment on this, which we really haven't got time for unfortunately. erm Sorry, I think we'll just stick with Faulkner for a moment, because I think that leads us on to the constant tragedies of battle casualties, which were obviously very much brought in into Oxford whenever people were wounded outside they were often brought in to Oxford to be cared for, there was a hospital out of Yarnton too, but a great many were cared for all over Oxford, and the greatest of course were buried at Christchurch. erm The tombs bear witness to this, there's two governors actually, Sir William Pendon who died of one of the epidemics in Oxford and Sir Henry Gage who was another governor, who was only governor for a month because he was killed in a scuffle near Abingdon. erm But the grandest funeral of the lot was the King's cousin, erm which was, erm and the funeral procession came from Magdalen down to Christchurch, the footman soldiers came, he was, sorry, killed at the battle of Edgehill, and the funeral took place on January 13th 1643. ‘The footman soldiers came first with their muskets under their arms, the noses of the muskets being behind them. The pikemen trailed their pikes on the ground, the horsemen followed with their pistols in their hands, the handles being upwards. The tops of the colours also were borne behind, a chariot, covered in black velvet where the body was, drawn by six horses, and the man that drove the chariot strewed money about the streets as he passed. Three great volleys of shot at the interring of the body, and lastly an herald of arms proclaimed his titles.’ Well, if death can ever be glamorous, that, I suppose, is the glamorous side of war casualties, but I think we need to spend the rest of our time very much looking at what it was like for the ordinary people of St Aldate's. erm And here, I apologise for producing a modern slide of Carfax, but I think just to remind you that we are talking about a very busy crowded city area, and erm about a city whose whole aspect was changing during the war. The university buildings, all around St Aldate's, the Bodleian had become a warehouse, full of corn, coal, cheese and the uniforms for the King's lifeguards were made there. New College was an arsenal, Magdalen College had the heavy ordnance, which was clattering through the streets drawn by horses, whenever it was brought in. There were mills all round the city that were grinding gunpowder or sword blades. erm I think the city must have become a real mess, there were stores piled up everywhere, wood, coal, corn, often I think they had to build sort of, something to hold the corn, there's a lot of the evidence for that in the college accounts certainly. Military stores, every musketeer had to have at least two metres of match which was a fairly thick cord, which was used to ignite his musket, and if you start thinking about how many musketeers there were around in Oxford, a whole lot of match had to be stored. That's quite combustible, sort of oiled cord. erm And there was, of course, powder had to be stored as well . And as well as that, beyond the city walls, fortifications were being erected all the way round the north of Oxford, the bits that weren't covered by the river. That's another story, where they were, and if you're interested, downstairs there's a very good map that shows you superimposed on a modern map of Oxford where they were, but they very much affected citizens in the St Aldate's, because every citizen, and every scholar who was still in the university, between the ages of 16 and 60 had to work on the fortifications at least one day a week, or pay a shilling fine. And getting them to work was a constant problem and collecting the fines, and we do actually know about this. If you would like to look at the second sheet on your erm of the two that you've got, erm this really brings to mind , one day in St Aldate's, in the summer of 1643, when a very hard working, methodical loyal official, Edward Heath, was ordered by the King and his Council to walk around St Aldate's, and make a list of all the defaulters, all those who had failed to work on the fortifications. erm And there are erm it's quite difficult to read until you get used to it, but erm the title is nice and easy, could I just have a copy, erm down there? I don't want to deprive you. erm Now, if you look at the top, you see the widow Smith's house, and then it says ‘the officers would not speak with him’. Next to that would be a sort of double stroke in the margin, erm can you see the name Holloway erm Well, on the line below that, erm it's talking about the Earl of Newark and his servants, and then on the following line it says, ‘removed to Trinity College and son gone out of town’. erm Now, there's a very nice one, if you move down to the single stroke, you see there are two 2s written, and below that there's a single stroke. erm And if you look at the second line, and begin three words in, it says ‘the mistress,’ the mistress is abbreviated, ‘answers her man cannot work, nor can she spare him till she be paid for what her husband did for the King's soldiers’. You can just imagine her standing arms, you know, just telling the man where he . erm Perhaps you can begin to pick out where it keeps saying no Answer. The next two in the margin, if you go further in you'll see a ‘noe answere’. (It's always spelt N O E, and answer has an E.) One does have this feeling that people were getting wind of Mr Edward Heath walking down the street, and were going out the back doors of the house. erm Yes, now if we get to about half way down there's a plus in the margin, and the third line in the bracket below that plus, more or less on a level with a three dot, and a little bit below, it says, William, I think it's Wilkinson, a minister, curate of St Ebbe's Parish, ‘his answer that he must attend the burials and christenings’, so obviously he couldn't work on the fortifications. And then, if we go right down to the bottom, there's a whole lot bracketed together against the . ‘No answer, but that they would not pay’, they ought not to pay. erm And one can go on picking out a great many of these people once you get used to the writing. It is fairly easy to read, once you begin to get . Now, as well as the fortifications, I think one wants to erm very much keep in mind that the citizens of St Aldate's were constantly being asked for money. There were these big loans for instance, £2,500 once the city had to make to the king. And this was collected by the parishes, and we know that St Aldate's had to pay £280, which along with All Saints, the city church, was the highest amount from all the various parishes. And then there was money for maimed soldiers, for what they called visited persons, which was the plague, fire and candles for the courts of guards, that was paying for fire and candles for all the little sentinel posts round Oxford. If they were freemen, they had to give up their right to graze in Port Meadow, because erm the hay was to be grown there, to be promised to His Majesty. They had to perhaps give up their pots and pans, or they were supposed to. Actually, a remarkably few were collected, to provide brass for armaments. And there were actually arms collections too. They were supposed to raiding the city regiments and paying for it, there was constant trouble for this, and the man who was appointed colonel by the king, Nicholas Selby, was very unpopular. But I think the main thing that they all had to bear to survive, was a tremendous amount of overcrowding. erm Now, we're fast running out of time, aren't we. What I am going to talk about next is erm I'll just mention that, about another 5 minutes, I think, will get us to the other great bit of work that poor old Edward Heath had to do in St Aldate's, which again, that gives us a great deal about the insight as to what it was like there. erm I just put that up, which should have been up while we were talking about money, which is erm the beautiful Oxford crown, which you can see downstairs, which was minted at New Inn Hall, the college that emptied, and was turned into the mint, mostly from college plate. erm And, of course, that was a symbol of all the problems of money that the king had, and the ordinary citizens of Oxford had in trying to provide him with it, mostly very reluctantly and unwillingly. With everything going on about the Poll tax, it's extremely easy for us to understand how they felt. Now, this is not an Oxford cartoon either, but it's a looting soldier, and very much, I think, underlines what people felt about soldiers around the place, and to go back to the overcrowding, erm the great problem was that constantly not only soldiers, but a great many other people, court officials, court servants, barbers, whoever, erm all had to found accommodation, and because St Aldate's was so near the court, a great many of them were of course connected with the court, they had some high ranking ones. Now once again we know about this because Edward Heath was given another job, just about nine months later, the king had decided he would summon a parliament in Oxford erm and in January '44 it was due to meet, but where were the members who were going to come into Oxford to stay. And so Edward Heath was sent round in January 1644, all the houses in St Aldate's to find out how many people were in them to see if there was any more room. And once again of course, meticulously, he kept his records. erm You can see, probably recognise the writing erm we've just been looking at. This is his final total after he'd been all the way round St Aldate's, he went round 73 houses, and he says here, I think this is a sort of hieroglyphic that would probably mean something like 'item'. Gentlemen and their men servants — 267, these are the extra people staying in the houses, not the people who lived in St Aldate's normally, women — 66, children under 16 years of age — 13, soldiers of the life-guards — 62, total in this parish — 408. So that's 408 extra people living in St Aldate's houses. Now, I think there's probably a very nice parallel here, I can't help thinking it was probably a bit better, must have been better organised in the Second World War, but there's going to be a erm special exhibition here isn't there, on memories of change on Oxford in the Second World War, and of course there were a great many extra people there too. And, because Edward Heath is so meticulous, we do know who were in all these different houses. erm I won't go through too many of them, erm but Blue Boar Inn, for instance, had 21 extra people, had some of the King's servants, some of the prince's servants, they had two Scottish peers, and their servants, £ 21 extra people, in a big inn, there were 14 rooms, I think, that were, could be called living rooms, but never-the-less, I think it must have been pretty crowded. £ But I think to give us perhaps a more vivid idea of what it must have been like for ordinary people, these are 3 houses in St Aldate's that don't exist any more, they're down more-or-less where the police station is, erm and we do know exactly who lived there, and who was actually there during the war. Sorry, I'm trying to find the right bit of paper. There we are. Right, now £ This is, yes, this is a fairly big house that was put together 31 and 32. Then there was a erm largish house, this one, and then a very small one on the end. And erm there has been some research done, they produced a plan of what they actually consisted of in the 17th century. The top layer was built, that you saw in the photograph, was built later, so 31 and 32 had two rooms, erm on the ground floor, and 2 on the first floor, 33, which was smaller, but it does have a fair sized room, and another upstairs, and then the very small one is 34. Now, in 31 and 32, lived a prosperous widow, the widow of a butcher, a mistress Jane Hawks, who was carrying on her husbands business, and doing quite well at it. She had a step-son and a wife, but we don't quite know whether they were there or not. But she also had living there a Colonel Stringer who was quite an important Scots Officer, three of his servants and a sergeant and one other soldier, so she had 6 extra people. Next door was a parchment maker, who had one corporal billeted on him, but we also know that 2 soldiers died in his house, and so it's possible that he actually looked after wounded soldiers, which was, of course happening all over Oxford. £ And then in the tiny house lived a widow, Elizabeth Treadwell, with one sergeant and two other lifeguards, so she had 3 soldiers in that tiny house. What we don't know, of course, is how they organized their living accommodation, whether they ever got paid, they were given these sort of , £ tickets that were supposed to be honoured later on, but as far as we can make out, they hardly ever were, erm and how the people got on, we just have to use our imagination, but it is interesting that here for instance in these three, we actually apart from anything else have two women house-holders, who are obviously erm women who are carrying on business of some independence. £ Well, I think I really had better stop there, and then if you want to ask any questions erm we can go into them, but perhaps I could just mention two things that I would like to have said more about, one was, that you probably know, there were three or two major epidemics in Oxford, of what they call plague, but it was probably a form of typhus, in 1643 and 44, and a good deal of sickness, I think, still in 1645, and the other was that there was a very serious fire, which almost certainly arose from these kind of living conditions, because Anthony Wood says it was a soldier roasting pig, erm and I think a lot of cooking went on in very unsuitable situations. And the fire actually started beyond the North Wall, just by the North Gate, but the wind was blowing from the North, and it blew it down, and although it didn't burn the rather better stone houses, facing onto St Aldate's, erm behind I think a lot of the poorer houses did suffer, and St Ebbe's parish, next door, suffered a great deal, and because it was war, I think they just, the city council, city records lament that there how hard it is for people, and there's no money to help them. So it's erm there was in fact a great petition made to the king on these very lines, really because of the fire. So I think life was erm boring, tough, hard-working, pretty unpleasant during the war, erm and I think most of the citizens must have been very very relieved when the surrender finally came, and it brought no actual fighting, and at least the city was left reasonably unscathed. do you think it'd be a good idea if you started doing some revising I went oh yeah I'll have a think about it and I sort of like walked out the door and went yeah I've thought about it . going to me all my comments on my thing were really good. Mine weren't bad. Apart from given you a B yeah on why it's just hanging in, must try a lot lot harder, gives me a B and then erm someone gave me a C someone gave me a C and said oh yeah gave me a C yeah and said coasting. gave me a C yeah and said improved greatly from the last showed much better in his work and really trying hard and gave me a C. yeah, I got f I got, my total marks I could've got was fifty eight and I got fifty four and she gave me a C and she said must improve your marks. And he goes Bloody hell. he goes nah there must be something wrong with this she go he goes I can't, I don't think we can complain about that can we? He's good about that. He goes, he goes he goes, he goes He doesn't just look at the mark. I think we'll scrap cos you missed a week I went She averaged practically all of my marks for some unknown reason. What do you mean? The total amount of marks possible was two hundred and five and I got a hundred and nineteen or something I don't know and , and goes yes I had to average five of his marks because he was absent. Take averages of the send this er this er what I call minuscule carrot erm this year er the capital receipts from November last year until December next year erm a anyone had undoubtedly for most of that back in the in in the use er er a grant and I think it, as the government have actually kept extremely quiet on this subject, that seemed to be the scenario that seems most likely to happen. I think our erm . all those in favour. A couple of points I'd like to respond to councillors . Firstly I have never seen a more clearer er grant from the government to actually let you build houses this year, this is whole point of th th this should happen and if we don't take it up I believe that in future years to come we shall regret it very, very strongly indeed. As far as promotion is concerned, yes I will not deny every tenant probably knows about the right to buy but then everybody knows there are mars bars and mars bars spend millions of pounds promoting their product. You have to y y y you have to promote the product to make people buy it. I'm following on from that. Of course people must be advised carefully but it shows great lack of faith in human na in their abilities and a great arrogance on our part Mr Mayor if we fail to market the ideas simply because we don't feel the populus are competent to understand it. If we fail to take this opportunity Mr Mayor, as I as I feel we are about to do I am a hundred percent convinced that in years to come people will look back at this year, or however long it happens to be and say they missed out on a golden opportunity to make social, to make more houses and to make social housing better in this city and across the country. I very much hope that you will in fact support the motion as originally intended. Could I just point out that councillor that contrary to call my bluff, deviation and repetition are no grounds for allowing allowing . All those in favour of the proposals please show and all those against. I now turn to the adoption minutes of city hall and now it is a process of in that city hall did not endorse a recommendation from the finance panel, the budget that came from finance panel erm so we are in the slightly unusual position of having to debate the proposals of finance panel as we were recommended to do by city hall, erm that means as I understand it that er the chair of city hall will now present the annual budget statement erm and since he is going to do that in a form of an amendment er that seven other unusual features about the way in which we would normally do it which would mean that there would be er a budget statement and where there would then be the the formal proposals and amendments themself, erm so what I would propose is to try and make sure that everybody has, has maximum opportunity to have their say erm because no two amendments can be on the floor at one time er to take what the leader of the council said first of all erm then to allow the other two leaders to present their budget alternatives as it were, without it be, this is just not didn't take it at that point if they don't want to. But to present the full scenario and then vote er on the the different items er so that voting is done on items on the amendment before we then proceed er if you want to we just have to go to amendments to that because of course no two amendments can be on the floor at the same time. Er, what I would prefer to do is to er listen to the amendment put forward by the as if that were an amendment to the adoption minute since there's nothing to be adopted at the moment, erm I will then speak on that amendment, well I would probably speak against it erm at that point er there could be a vote on that amendment line by line. When that vote is finished er there there's then the opportunity for further amendment. Absolutely. A a a and that i i if that's sort of what you're saying. That that that's exactly what I was, I was . Mr Mayor on on a point of order Mr Mayor er standing order sixty two refers explicitly to community charge or the poll tax, I think that before we move into this debate we should amend that so that it does refer to the council tax which is what we will be debating. to my left has anything to say on the subject. My only slight reservation is whether it's possible to have,t t to move an amendment to standing order . Can, can we take that as being unanimous? Yes. Good, good. Thank you very much. Leader of the councils. We have known for a number of years that we with every other council in the land, are facing the government that does not believe in local government. That believes that local councils should operate services, should do it at the dictate of the department of the environment and indeed it's regrettable that we are surrounded by some local authorities who feel that their world is precisely that. Far be it for me to mention Huntingdon district council but that is one which immediately leaps to mind. The fact that their citizens leak into the city to avail themselves of our facilities is something that we might deal with in another sphere, even on day residents were seen to attend the theatre in this town recently, erm unfortunately this authority doesn't see fit to actually subsidise the theatre. However,it is that means that over the last few years every time we have actually debated about budget we recognised that the force had unwillingly and against the judgement of the majority of this council, not necessarily er bounded by political affiliation, we have to be getting down further and further towards the completely inaccurate expanded spending assessment that is assessed as necessary for the needs of this city by the department of the environment. Now clearly this is a process that is going to continue this year. We had originally intended to freeze our budget at precisely the level that it has been at the last two years for a variety of reasons we have decided that it is sensible to actually bring it down yet further. There are two reasons for this. Firstly the process of moving down towards our S S A needs to be facilitated because my own instinct is that the government, faced with all sorts of financial tribulations, is going to take a harder and harder nosed attitude towards local government expenditure, as it will unfortunately with an awful lot of the rest of what we have come to expect over the decades to be the responsibility of central government, clearly the current expenditure review is going to have some nasty shocks in it for consumers of account services, consumers of other assets of the welfare state but particularly I would suspect, the local government. Additionally however, we need to make it clear that when we have looked at the figures and I would pay some to the opposition for bringing er some matters to our attention, erm and looking at the way in which very, very careful on the part of this council has led to a better reserve position than we would previously have expected. There is a sense of which that good housekeeping with the inevitable consequences of government policy can be, can be in terms if you like, or benefits to the council tax payers, who have after all in a under the complete disaster of the poll tax which nobody but nobody in this chamber I suspect knew more unless there is at least one partisan tory who will try to save it, it was really a wonderful experiment and it's a shame it didn't continue. On that basis we have an amendment to the budget as presented to the finance panel and as the Mayor explained . If I can talk immediately to scope of that amendment before moving on to some points about the budget . With regard to the first lies my group has come to the conclusion that there is a way in which the employment development budget can be augmented to specifically reserve at least the part of the current posish provision provided by the cooperative development erm we stand by our opinion that there are ways in which that service can be more efficiently administered that this is a sensible way forward. With regard to the contingency contingency is something which has often been a matter of debate within this council. It has been a matter of debate because there are those in the council who feel that if you put in a contingency provision it will be spent whether it's needed or not. There are many of us who feel that it is sheer wilfulness if one assumes that there will be no contingency in the course of the year that needs to be budget . This year might represent a compromise with regard to the those two opposition positions which again I would suggest are something that perhaps owes more to than it does to actual political affiliation. The regard to the job evaluation budget suggests that our original figure of a hundred thousand pounds is not fully necessary and that can all be reduced to fifty percent, to fifty percent or the equivalent say to fifty thousand pounds and the same goes for the judgement with regard to how you are going to have figure with regard to jobs vacancies. That will bring the eventual budget down a fine tune particularly with regard to er recommendations of the housing committee with regard er to the erm which clearly there will be some people. What we have done is to suggest that we actually need a lower budget than we had originally assessed. This is in line with the obvious policy, not just of the ruling group, but I suspect of the council as a whole that we know that sooner or later courtesy of this government, whether we like it or not we are going to have to get down to our standard spending assessment. The policy of this council over the last couple of years has been to get down to that figure enforced upon us as gracefully as possible with the least damage to our services and the least damage to the morale of our staff and our staff are after all the most important asset that a local authority possesses and that is what we're trying to consider. Everybody will be aware of the fact that in the course of the last two budgetary years we have made savings in excess of what we had anticipated. Those savings have been achieved by very careful housekeeping indeed. By a rigid look at vacancies, by the constant search after efficiency, efficiency savings. By looking hard at any way in which we can raise extra income for this authority. A classic example of good housekeeping which has made Cambridge a authority in the region and beyond and one that even members of the conservative government have occasionally, through gritted teeth they're not doing a bad job, damn them and that means that the are going to think to have some of those, if you like, very good housekeeping back to the citizens who have been paying the bills over the years. For instance to this is an assumption that although we are going to have a shortfall on the collection fund, again because of good housekeeping we believe that this action is what people want by the charge payers of the city and again that in this financial year it can be taken out of the . This seems to me to be a highly , high responsible budget bringing us closer and closer to a position where we will eventually reach. We are spending now, if this budget is accepted, a mere eleven percent of the standard spending assessment levels which means that in time we are going to get down to where the government is going to demand that we . We may not want it but the government is going to demand it and we as custodians of the services on the part of the people of Cambridge, are going to have to do as sensibly and sensitively as possible. There are some more points I've got to make about the budget in general. The first thing is that I think people need to recognise that the investigation of savings generated a figure of one point four million pounds. That is an extraordinary amount of money to find in terms of savings. It's not a figure that represents gross inefficiencies, gross over expenditure. What it represents I would suggest, is the desperate attempt to trim off the margin to find every single last way in which we can follow the government diktat whilst preserving our full services. But I do think that we need to recognise this on council that there is a cost associated with that one point four million pounds worth of savings and those costs come in two different directions. One cost is that clearly some services are being cut in terms of how good they are. We need to recognise that some letters will take longer to answer that public loos will not be as fully attended as they have been in the past. That some community events will not take place. That some voluntary organisations will not get the grants that they previously expected. All of these trims at the margins which I would suggest, detract from the quality of life of people in this city, something that we regret, but something which can and has been enforced upon us. We're trying to the horrors of central government diktat are all closing upon this city. But there is a cost of that and it's a cost that people will recognise. They will recognise it too in terms of higher charges than perhaps ideally we would want to impose for certain services which the city operates, whether it be sports pitches or whether to be brutal, it's the cost of actually burying the dead. Perhaps those are things that in the best of all possible worlds we wouldn't want to but we are forced so to do. But there's another cost to the savings that have been exemplified and that we are going to be forced to take with regard to this budget and that is something that anybody who uses the city council services, and particularly I would suggest councillors, are going to notice and that is the stress that we are putting on the people that we employ. It is all very well to say to any people organisation you shall become more and more efficient. In the end there has to be a limit, there has to be a level beyond which you cannot go without people cracking under the strain, without people saying I'm now doing the job that was done by two people, two and half people a few years ago. It doesn't mean that you don't look for efficiencies but it does mean that we need to recognise that we are putting a burden on our staff which I think we will be callous and stupid to disregard. I that in terms of many of the so called efficiency measures that we could take, we are reaching the absolute limits in this authority. There are areas, one or two of which I will go on to elude to, which I still think are actually going to make for the greatest savings in the coming financial year and thereafter. But in terms of saying there are easy savings to be found in terms of greater efficiencies in this authority I warn you, we are reaching the level unless we actually want in putting a completely unacceptable level of stress on the people who we employ and who universally serve this city very finely and give such a very high level of service. I know that there are views among the opposition groups about what should be cut out of this budget. We have decided that the fundamental points as far as the is concerned is the presentation of services. Wherever we have looked for savings, we have looked to trimming away at the centre and preserving those services that are delivered to the citizens in a direct way. Some of them and we make no bones about this, are delivered undoubtedly to minorities, they're delivered to small groups of people in the city, to people who are in any care in the community need to be given special consideration. If we house them we need to look after all the people, we make no apologies for the fact that this is a budget slanted towards equal opportunities and to an anti-poverty strategy and that is something that we will fight to preserve and we would expect support from at least some quarters in order to achieve an egalitarian status in this city. The same is true of some of the bids, we've allowed more bids this year than perhaps it was the case in the past. The bids that we have wording of support. We want to do something for the voluntary sector. Fifty thousand pounds extra for the voluntary sector at a time when a recession, when so called but completely un care in the community is putting a tremendous burden of responsibility both on the voluntary sector and on we know what a good job the voluntary sector do in this city thousand pounds is a small proportion of the money that they are actually requesting from us. It's in a place in the direction of the work that they do, it is not enough, we would like to provide more. But ill betide anyone who says, says that that is money that's not going to be . Pollution, the environment, again that is something which is not just for concern, we know it's of global concern as well. We have some responsibilities in that direction. Yes we have to operate within our resources, but if we're looking to er how recycling that seems to us a bid which is worthy of backing regardless of political affiliation. If you listen to any national politician they pay to the importance of environmental concerns and to actually say that that's a bid that can't be approved. Putting more money into the taxi part scheme, a scheme that is anything but everybody in the surrounding authorities, how many of us have had letters from the residents of Gerton or Promberton or wherever else complaining that they want to be included in this scheme. Something that provides a life line, mobility for people who otherwise would find that they were being seriously disadvantaged, that their lives would not be as full as . Each and every one of the bids however they refer to particular minority groups, whether they refer to the group are I think, justifiable. They're justifiable because we're doing within very tight financial constraints. This is a very responsible budget indeed. It brings down our level of expenditure. It leaves no fortune with regard to what the department of the environment might throw at us next year unless they completely lose their marbles, which after all is always possible. Which I suspect the odd tory MP having a heart attack, falling under a bus, the loss of directions might actually mean that they might see a degree of sense in borough capping . It leaves few hostages to fortune with regard to the department of the environment. We after all, bring our expenditure down, we're down near two million pounds under new cap capping rules. That is not under any circumstances responsible judging. It is also the budget that has taken notice of what the opposition have actually said we listened to you we have not persevered with our original thinking, we've talked to the officers, we've listened to what you've said, we may not have done it with the greatest grace possible but . Comes very much as difficult to grace but erm and we have brought our expectations down. But the budget in general is one that we withstand. We think that it conserves services, that it has searched out the vast majority of efficiencies that we can find within this council and that it doesn't pass on to the poll tax, council tax payers the fruits, I mean it does pass on the poll tax or council tax payers the fruits of how we have achieved savings and efficiencies over the last couple of years. We've done well it's time that that was actually passed on . There are further areas which in time year will allow that trend to continue, I'm aware of the fact that there will probably be in the course of the evening that suggest that greater efficiencies can be found in a variety of areas whether it be in or wherever else. We have our own ideas about that. We have gone out with regard to our team through voluntary competitive tender. That is designed to save money for this authority. We are looking seriously at the costs of such in-house items as car leasing. We've continued to keep a very hard view of the corn exchange and a number of other bodies which we fund, but we're going to see what actually happens, we're not going to make blind predictions about savings without actually going into the facts. If we make further savings in the course of the next financial year the benefit will be felt by the citizens of Cambridge and it's no good promising them things which we can't deliver. This is a budget that promises what it will deliver. That bears the fruits of past, sound financial management, preserved services and looks for as many efficiencies as possible. Far be it for me to say that this is the sort of budget that conservatives ought to applaud because it is after all, a budget that is guided by a feeling that councils should provide services and they should orientate their services to the least communities, to be guided by equal opportunities and by egalitarians and that's what this group has always stood for, this is the budget that we present tonight and I would hope that it would get a far better and far larger measure of support than perhaps of course been the case in the past. Is there a second? Yes. Is there anybody else . Thank you Mr Mayor, erm well this may be a budget the conservative might applaud but I'm . Yes,one wonders how get actually. David Owen might be buying membership soon. But seriously I'm against this budget because of what is, what it doesn't contain rather than what it does contain. the policies that it represents, still represents even as amendment. Repeat this evening. That labour's budget doesn't do anything new to meet those challenges. Education cuts. Interesting the party supposedly in favour of education groans when education is mentioned. Interesting to to speculate and I'll do this a little later on, ask them why the labour party's so obsessed with opposing education . There's also pollution the environment,the council mentioned those, there's nothing new in this budget. Nothing new about the lack of public transport in Cambridge. And about the biggest problem today, that of unemployment what we have is nine thousand pounds put back into the the employment development fund. Still leaving . What we have is nine thousand pounds put back into the employment development fund still leaving a cut. This is no time to cut anything from the employment development fund, from the training budget, even sixteen thousand pounds. So the fails to meet all these challenges. Make no apologise ds ds to starting with education, the county council is cutting seven million pounds from education this year. A dozen or more teachers in city schools may lose their jobs, maybe more. More than half the city's schools are faced with real cuts in their budgets. County talks about putting a million pounds back in and it turns out that this million pound in fact is part of a two million pound cut that appears to have been made. It's all a mistake of calculation from when the government nationalised further education. The city could act, the city could do something about it but it won't. The ruling group, the labour party, refuses to do anything about this at all. I don't want to hear any more nonsense about doing the county council's job because the city already does lots of things for the county council concessionary fares for the elderly for example. On the city board last week we had yet another example rather a good project Trumpington disability project, very likely but it's social services budget. And a question you have to ask yourself is why the labour party is prepared to spend on all the aspects of county council responsibility except education. Why is this? Why does the labour party seem to education? The one thing it will not, it will not spend money on. Education is important to everyone, it's not a m a minority group, it's important to individuals for their own self fulfilment, it's important for society for our economic future and our future as a democracy. So why the opposition and after all this time, eighteen months of debate. And from the labour party, reason after reason, feeble reason after reason . After all this time reason and reason's been knocked down, one after the other and what did we get last time? We got votes against our proposals with no reasons given at all, you've now got down to the point of having no reasons at all for opposing what we want to do. So what is why is it that labour party oppose education spend? So I think we're getting rather strange signals out of tonight's budget, on the one hand we have councillor the John Smith clone, although at least put a bit of weight on. On the other hand We seem to have a labour party that treats education as some kind of middle class hobby that thinks of education spending as something spent only on the bourgeoisie, something to do with a university, something not really important for ordinary people. If that's not the reason, what is the reason? And one suspects it might be back in the days of the nineteen fifties, nineteen sixties when the labour party opposed anything at local level,of course, but at local level that might tend towards helping people to be upwardly mobile on the grounds that upwardly mobile people stop voting labour. I don't want to go to the story as to why the labour party opposed the er th the entry to the city of Marks and Spencer but it's an interest . They didn't want working people to have decent clothes . I really do hope the labour party is stuck in some kind of thirties plan I'm afraid I've got my doubts. Will you stop laughing. the circumstances I wonder how well this is to the current debate as opposed to amendments which I suspect will be moved later on. I'll give my reasons for voting against this budget. It's got no education spending. I I I think that councillor should be allowed to continue. because er he's just one person who remembers those years. Ooh. There are other grounds remaining for opposing this budget. It still hasn't tackled all the waste there is in the council, we'll get back to that when we amendment. It still hasn't done anything new, has no new ideas about traffic and environmental problems. And of course it's a budget which is on an attitude towards the Parkside Pool problem which we disagree with therefore in no way do we support it. But there are many reasons, as you will see when we put our amendment asking why are budget proposals are different from the ruling groups but the main reasons are simply the ruling group's refusal, for whatever reason, I just wanna hear the reasons. to do anything about the major problems facing the city. Councillor . Yes I would like also to speak against this amendment erm but for completely different reasons. I don't intend to give the council a to solving the world's problems and that's not the word to mind but problems. . Because I do recognise Mr Mayor er I have to say, that this amendment is a step in the right direction. But I believe that the councillor er is somewhat cynical in the what that he has put this forward. Tories producing rabbits out of hats is the big bad headline, wasn't it. You know we're the ones accused of doing these things at the last moment. We're the ones who you know, don't tell anybody what our strategy is going to be, we suddenly spring it on the members right at the end of the process at the council meeting. We're not running the council the labour group are running the council er but they on this occasion Mr Mayor, are the ones producing the rabbits out of the hats. And I'll congratulate the leader of the council on a wonderful conjuring act with this amendment. I asked at the meeting of the city board and I asked on more than one occasion, and didn't get a proper answer, what the labour group intended to do with the three point two million pounds that will build up in reserve say for the next three years. I made it clear that our policy was to use that money to reduce the level of the council tax over that period of time. I couldn't get any clear commitment er from er you Mr Mayor, or the leader of the council as to what would do with that three point two million pounds. I also pressed at the city board for something to be done about this problem of the er people disappearing off the poll tax register at an alarming rate I must add. And I was absolutely amazed and I think all of us on the opposition benches were absolutely amazed at the city board that you appeared to have no proposals whatsoever to do anything about that situation. I find found that absolutely incredible and I thought it was bizarre to say the least, the procedure we had to go through the other er evening erm with two hours of acrimonious debate er a break while you consulted er the officers before we got to some er sensible way forward which is now incorporated in this amendment er to spend a hundred thousand pounds on actually trying to trace . But spending that hundred thousand pounds as we were told at the time, would only part solve the problem. The potential deficit on the poll tax collection fund er because of these people not registering is well over million pounds and that by spending the hundred thousand proposed here, would actually bring it down to seven hundred and thirty five thousand pounds and that's where the conjuring trick is er this er amendment because of course, if you work out the increase in the balances that you are proposing to take in this amendment, it works out exactly to seven hundred and thirty five thousand pounds, well it does on my calculations Mr Mayor. Exactly seven hundred and thirty five thousand pounds. So you're doing exactly what we were telling you to do a few weeks ago, that you had to er take money out of reserves or you had to cut down on the level of services if you were to avoid putting that thirty four pounds on the council tax bills this year. And you very cleverly, very cleverly and I, this is where I congratulate you, built this in to your proposals tonight. There are some things in this that obviously we can support, the delete or reduction in the contingency pros p provision to a hundred thousand pounds, we're going to be moving later on to delete even that amount but it's surprising you were telling us you've been telling us for years you have to have two hundred thousand pounds in the contingency. All of a sudden in a matter of two weeks, you can take a hundred thousand pounds out of it. We welcome the reduction in the job evaluation budget to fifty thousand pounds. The officers told us er some time ago that that could be done quite easily. If the officers could tell us that why didn't they tell the controlling labour group, I'm sure they did and then the question is why didn't you listen to them. Why then did you put over a hundred thousand pounds in that budget in the first place? I welcome that particular proposal. You questioned Mr Mayor at the city board when I put forward the proposal to increase the er turnover figure from three percent to four percent. You said, explain that councillor Evans, tell us how you're going to do it. Well perhaps you or somebody on the other side might care to tell us how you're gonna take it from three to three and half, cos I'll quite happily tell you then how we'll take it from three and half to four percent, so we welcome that as a step in the right direction. Obviously as I say, we would support the additional bid of a hundred thousand for pursuing the poll tax er non-registers. And obviously we would want to take money out of reserves, our original amendment took one point three million pounds out of reserves and it's interesting to see now that you're suggesting almost that figure again and yet for years you've been telling us you can't take this money out of the reserves, er you know we had to keep it for a rainy day. Do we take it that the rainy day has finally arrived? I think it has. But this does not go far enough for us and er shortly we will be moving another amendment which will take the council's budget down to the standard spending assessment and I will speak to that er when I come to move that amendment. No the standard spe spending assessment. Could I, just before I sit down, say one thing er why I disagree er with councillor . I think the liberal democrats are gonna find themselves rather strangely isolated here this evening, proposing the highest budget. Ah well we will wait and see erm, they're trying to solve everybody's problems but ours, er with all this talk about spending money on education, sorting out the traffic problems erm, it's a pity they don't spend a bit more time in their budget calculations in dealing with the problems of this council and not those of the county council. So Mr Mayor, for completely different reasons than the council have er I will be urging my group to vote against this amendment and to support a subsequent amendment which will take the budget down even further. Thank you. Councillor wishes to speak. Thank you Mr Mayor I just wanted t to come in with two fairly quick points er as to why I will not be able to support this amendment, but the first is that the leader of the council has indicated that the efficiency savings erm has got as far as it can go and that, you know, we have been trimming at the margins and there is no more margin left and that leads you to believe that perhaps one should be looking at somewhat more er root and branch type of pruning in the spending that that the labour group want to actually erm deal with, er and the second point I would like to make, and er I thank councillor for giving us a a a a new word tonight obfuscation because that describes exactly what I think the labour group are trying to do by bringing this figure down it removes the embarrassment they would have from having to add on a substantial sum of money f due to the failure to collect the cou er the community charge in previous years and I think that they are trying by by this amendment with some very quick foot work to try and delude the people of this city. Mr Mayor, councillor says that the labour group is running the council, that's manifestly not the case. The conservative group is running the council. And the conservative group is running the council in the sense that labour has scrambled, obviously over the last few days, to reduce its tax level to something closer to the tories and I'm going to stand with my fellow liberal democrats tonight and vote for a higher figure because, not only because I think that there's sort of things we want to do in our budget, are b are b are better and and would be better done than not done, but because I think there's a fundamental political ethical issue here and it's one which has been confronting this country for a great many years and which is going to be crucial in the next election. The question is, do the people of Britain believe in paying higher taxes for good services delivered by central and local government? I thought that progressives, political progressives in this country were prepared to stand by public services and believe in them sufficiently to say this will cost you and we are prepared to to put the bill to you because we believe you will pay the bill. What we have tonight is a labour group that says they no longer believe in that philosophy. What they believe in is that everybody out there is out to grab as much as they can for their own private interest and they're prepared to meet them halfway on that. There's no question who's running the council here, it's this lot. Reference to I think that last comment is of course a very interesting one . I thought the liberal democrats failed abysmally at that the last election. Can you say Mr Ashdown may have all the qualities of leadership except . And I suspect that the next election that will still prevail. But clearly the liberal democrats have not learnt the lesson of spending what you have and running prudent budgets. Even president Clinton is learning that, even as a democrat he had a reputation of fiscal responsibility as a government, but I must admit I welcomed his present er proposals in that regard. But that doesn't follow for the liberal democrats in this particular council. I don't think their proposals in that regard will be worthy of support. Er, but councillor other remark about the labour party moving towards the conservatives is of course a very fair one, but then surely nothing surprises us at the moment about the labour party. At long last they've come out in favour of wealth, isn't that extraordinary, reported in today's paper. They're also, Mr Mayor, interestingly coming out in favour of the individual but I must admit I applaud that and at long last in some, admittedly very modest way, er they are moving, I won't say to fiscal responsibility, but at least they're learning the lessons of the recklessness of the past of their policies. But what we have to bear in mind of course er the f financial propriety of this council would in a sense have been very easy over the years if the labour party previously had trimmed its budget according to what we could all afford. That they did not do and now the leader of the council said well they're trying to get down to the standard spending assessment at last, he could have done that a long time ago, you have had nothing but excess expenditure proposals on behalf of this city for many, many years. If we are above government guidelines it is the labour party's fault and if indeed we are penalised in the future it is the labour party's fault, none other and to the extent that you run the risk now by having this excess eleven percent budget over the er standing expenditure assessment er will once again unfortunately find you guilty in that regard. What I did find very distressing in his remarks, er were basically in respect of some of the savings . Again I must say it seems extraordinary doesn't it that er he pontificates the savings when really one is entitled to ask the question well why weren't they made before? I really can't think that you can claim those as savings. They're a pulling back of your excess expenditure. They are if you like a correctness of mismanagement. It can't be anything else, formal savings is not on and I think when you small items I was rather distressed by some of them. I think we're going to go as a council in the direction of not answering letters on time. In business that cost is one of the first items you do in efficiency terms. If you delay the answering of letters, of course that creates more letters chasing up the first ones and that is again where you are getting your priorities wrong, admittedly on a very small items. For the leader of the council to use the excuse in terms of savings about the cost of the burning of the dead. I think most of us have due respect and regard for proper procedure in that regard. One of the most emotional times for anyone. For you to downgrade that and say well I'm sorry now we're doing all this, we can't guarantee that, it's disgraceful, absolutely disgraceful. What I actually said was that the price that we would have to charge for burying the dead had to go up in order to ensure that in of the circumstances our standards could remain impeccable. That I regard as unfortunate . I'm very glad you clarified that Mr because certainly I not as I heard it er and I'm very pleased that was clarified and I think others would have felt likewise. Let me come on, let me come on then to a more disgraceful excuse er that er the leader of the council talked about. He talked about the stress on the people we employ. Most of us who've been on this council some years will have seen the stress that the labour party brought on a number of senior officers who felt obliged to leave in what I would call distressing circumstances. That was the pressure of the labour party policy and if there is any stress on staff in this council then it is at your responsibility. You are running this council and it up to you to ensure that you do not create employ because if that is what you're admitting to you're Councillor you've had over your time Thank you very much well I've been very pleased to make those points relating to the leader of the council. Since there are no further hands rushing up into the air I'll say a few words myself. Asking I think the proposals the labour group's . It's important that we look at the pattern of our spending as a local authority over the past five or six years. But that in some of the comments that have gone before. In those days the government assessed local authority needs according to a very in the grant related expenditure assessment, G R E A, greas and this is much more complex and sensitive measure of how much it costs to run a city and in those days what the government thought we should be spending and what we thought we should be spending seemed in fact to be very close indeed. In nineteen eighty seven, eighty eight, we spent ninety nine point eight eight percent of what the government thought . In nineteen eighty eight and eighty nine we spent ninety eight point two nine percent and in eighty nine ninety, ninety seven point one four percent of what the government thought we need we actually underspent in their terms. This was still a labour council, they were still a conservative government but there was a wonderful consensus about the spending needs of local authorities and how local authorities should be funded. That was what one might call a pre-poll tax consensus. In nineteen ninety one the S S A was introduced as the measure for assessing local authority needs and in that year our spending, instead of being one or two percent below what the government thought, it shot up to forty nine point nine five percent above the S S A figures. What had happened? Had labour suddenly become a local authority, or did the S S A simply fail as an accurate way of assessing our spending needs? The answer I think, lies in the fact that the government next year gave this authority an increase in its S S A of some thirty two point one percent, one of the largest increases in the country. Not quite enough perhaps but still enough to be an admission that they got it seriously wrong in the year before. Since that point though what has been the pattern of our budgets? Have we kicked against the and ignored the determination of central government to bolster their own problems with the P S B I by reducing local authority spending? No, from that figure of forty nine point nine five percent above S S A in nineteen ninety one we proposed a budge that had brought reductions year on year in that divergence of view. Each and every year there have been reductions. In nineteen ninety one the gap narrowed to thirty one percent from almost fifty nine. In ninety two, three it narrowed further to twenty two percent and this year we're proposing a budget that is only ten point eight percent adverse to the government's figures. We don't believe that the government is correct in their view of what the city needs. But we've not wilfully put at risk services or jobs by risking capping by going in the opposite direction. Equally we've tried not to traumatise the public or our staff by cutting back to the governments preferred level all at once. Our view is that the people of this city value the services the council provides and don't want them withdrawn. Ours has been a process of careful pruning year on year. It's not been without pain and I pay tribute to our staff's willingness to embrace the changes that we've had to make. In particular I think it should be recognised that the role of the unions, NALGO and G M D in helping that process of change has been quite fundamental and for that reason, because we appreciate and value the essential way in which the unions have contributed to the process of changing the organisation I consider that the they much trailed proposals from the opposition groups to cut, or in the other case, to reduce the NALGO office are quite misguided . I want to return however to the question of the pattern of taxation in the authority under labour control. It's of course only to be expected that people should moan about the tax they've got to pay and people always complain that it seems to go up every year. Well let me say quite clearly now, that is not true. Both as a percentage of budget and in real terms accounting for inflation, people are being asked to pay less today than they were in nineteen eighty eight. In eighty eight, eighty nine the rates, business and domestic, amounted to eighty one point seven percent of all the council's spending. The government contributed just eighteen point two percent so the bulk of our expenditure was born by local people directly. Today we're asking local people to pay only fifty seven percent instead of eight two. But politicians always speak in terms of percentages and real terms so let's look at the total tax which was demanded from people in the city in the past few years. In nineteen ninety, ninety one we asked for six point four seven four million in poll tax. In ninety one ninety two, five point four. In ninety two, three by point six seven and in the budget we propose tonight we've asked for four point five five million. No no allowing for inflations, no underlying trends under the labour proposals people in Cambridge will be paying less hard cash now than they did eight years ago. The council is spending prudently and efficiently and it's spending as little hard cash as is compatible with meeting the essential needs of the people who live in the city. I'm told I've got to wind up I have the discretion to give myself up. But you'll be relieved to know I'm not going . In that case Councillor has . Can we move to the vote then please on the amendment before us I proposed to take it. As point of order I believe as this is a proposal of an amendment of the city board city board is the city board chair's right of reply. Do you wish to exercise your right to reply? Very, very briefly indeed erm I would stand by what I said in my overall speech. I do think that the Erm, it doesn't matter what I propose, whether it actually makes out things that they've been talking about or whether it's completely found something to criticise about it. That's politics. What we've actually got here is a judicious budget proposal which yes, has changed over the last fortnight, I make no apologies for that. It also has to hinder to recognition of what the needs of the people of the city are and I actually cast out, wipe out services and the needs of central administration which is essential to any council and I would hope that not only my own back this amendment. Thank you. Can I ask us to to move the amendment erm in one A those in favour of that part of the amendment please show one A. What are we voting on? from the housing committee and nine thousand pounds from the environment committee were the following additional savings. Roman numeral one, those in favour please show. Those against please show. Roman numeral two please show in favour Thirty two. And those against roman numeral three, those in favour please and those against right. In B add at the end roman numeral one, those in favour please show . Thirty one Mr Mayor. And those against roman numeral two those in favour and those against roman numeral three those in favour and those against amendment D to read one two to eight O O nine please in that budget to thirty six three eight nine fifty, those in favour. Thirty two. And those against. In three alter the amounts calculated to read as follows, I hope that we can take that block in three as one since it all follows from what's gone before. Yes we have erm those in favour thank you, and those against okay thank you. Are there further amendments? Thank you councillor . Okay councillor can you proceed? Does everyone have a copy of this one good er Mr Mayor erm all budgets are a balance between er spending on database services and spending on capital projects and on keeping taxes down. All three elements have to come in to any budget decision and nobody can ignore all three, indeed if you look around three groups of the council you'll see that all the budget proposed tonight will take into account all three areas. Conservative budget for example even though its main press is always on keeping the tax level down er will often include capital projects. For example they support the market square project and at the end of the day even with the total budget down to S S A the vast bulk of the money being spent by conservative budget's been spent on people salaries but it's still being spent on services and the labour party this year has lost the three elements keeping the tax down and that's quite a good thing to see. Though I should say that what councillor said that my group were prepared to set a higher tax level if that were necessary. That's what we said at the general election. By my judgement as the amendment reflects is that it isn't necessary but if it were I would have no hesitation s whatsoever in increasing the level of taxation to pay for what needs to be paid for. It needs to be understood that what divides the parties isn't so much that one party believes in capital projects, on party in revenue spending and one party in keeping the taxation levels down. What divides them is solely of judgements on the bounds between those three elements. I should say that for us revenue services, ordinary database services do come first keeping the tax level does come second and the prestige projects, even rather good ones like the market square project definitely come third. It's not to say that we are against capital projects, we are not. We have included in our proposal this year twenty thousand revenue effects of a hundred thousand pounds capital bid on traffic calming and other similar measures, something which is very popular around the city, as long as you ask people what they want first and which in previous years we put forward as a revenue bid. We decided the best way to deal with that question is through a capital bid and that's what we've done. And also of course there is the question of Parkside Pool although observant members of the council will notice that Parkside Pool isn't mentioned in our amendment. That is because, fortunately I suppose,our Parkside modernisation scheme we are reliable informed by officers, would have no revenue effects in ninety three, ninety four. It would have revenue effect of course in ninety four, ninety five and our future budget will have to reflect that. But in this year the first year of the project, because it will be towards the end of the year anyway it has no revenue, net revenue effect. the basic day to day problems that we want to concentrate on and on the challenges it faces. Education fund is in there we've not raised the price but that is our top priority and we believe it's societies top priority also in our amendment is our idea for extending concessionary bus fares for journeys within the city to those of school age who do not quality for the statutory schemes run by the county. The idea there is to try to get some reduction, some reduction in the level of traffic at peak hours and to help public transport. And of course in a scheme like that many details have to be worked out especially in negotiations with the bus company for the figure we have put in is I think a realistic figure for the first year of the scheme. We also want to bring about improvements in some well appreciated services. Services the council provides which we think could benefit from extra resources. The example of this of course is the night time call out service, which all parties support, which comes every year as a problem of funding, do we want a full week service? And we do, the question is can we afford it and we think we can. These services of course have to be paid for and we do aim to keep the level of taxation as low as possible but of course we can't aim to bring it down as far as conservatives would want because we need, we in the city need, to spend money on things like the education fund without which it becomes a city less worth living in. But we are looking f for savings to make greater efficiencies and we think we've found some. I'm gonna start with the support for trade unions small item twenty six thousand pounds to the NALGO project, there's a G M B budget but that's all nearly all paid for out of direct services we don't want to touch that. This county pays for a full time union official this is extravagant, one full timer for five hundred members, that is way over the top let me tell you. I'll give you one example the union of communication workers for the post office has one full time worker, one full time officer for two to three thousand. So we propose to cut that support by half in this year and to keep it under review for future years as well. Because we want to see a review of the whole system of union representation within the council to see whether it's an appropriate sort of representation for an organisation of this size. We are not against unions, we are for unions, unions can be very useful not only for their members but also for the management, we recognise that. The amount of money put in by the public. I would say to you you've already spent seven minutes of your time erm now allow you seven minutes in initially also and so Well St Aldate's in the Civil War is quite a problem to talk about really, erm in half an hour, because it's so enmeshed in the story of Oxford in the Civil War which is a long, very interesting one, so what I'm going to try and do is erm to pick out some of the local landmarks that did survive in the 17th century and relate them to what we know about some of the people and in this short half an hour, just try and picture what it was like to live in St Aldate's during the civil war. Obviously a whole lot else is . I think it's quite important to orientate ourselves first, and you're looking at a map of Oxford in 1643, erm and 17th century maps for the most part are what we should call upside down. The north is at the bottom, and I think it helps if you stop thinking about it as a map and you think about it as a birds-eye view, a helicopter view, erm and then the whole thing begins to make sense. erm Now, what you've got there is a slightly later map of 1675, which is exactly the same, the north is at the bottom, I'm afraid the top is not very obvious, if I could just hold it up, you've got the castle there, directors' and your particular erm, fees in particular. But er it, it, it er it appears to have been overlooked that, erm some of the directors who were in the bracket in nineteen eighty eight of two hundred and thirty thousand to two ninety five thousand have been increased from three hundred and fifty five thousand this year to a top of four hundred thousand. Er, you have also erm mentioned about the bonus er, can I take it from what you have said that this is profit-related? If not I suggest it should be and, er, therefore if unfortunately the profits of the company did go down in the foreseeable future the salaries of yourself and your directors would be reduced. As regards the salaries of the U S A we've read and seen about so many companies that pay sky-high for v various salaries and other schemes, we don't want that in this country but we do want a degree of evenness and I would repeat as somebody has already said, that your salary has gone up fifty six percent which is very, very high. Now there was one other thing if you would care to take it is that you said that it would involve a great deal of organization for concessionary tickets for Alton Towers or Tussauds or any others. Erm Ready Mix have a theme park in Th Thorpe Park and there's no problem there of issuing tickets to shareholders for erm, entertainment of their, their families. They d don't make so much fuss about it they distribute it and it gets on very satisfactory and people er, are very happy to receive these tickets. I think the question of turning it down, that a lot of work is er, forgive my bluntness nonsense. Er one other thing is the the share capital is sixty five billion pounds. It's true that we had a issue erm nineteen eighty five but the reserves are now six hundred and fifty million. Whether you have given this the same consideration of the increase in, er, directors' salaries I don't know, but I think y it's worthy of, er, a further consideration. Er one last thing er, do we need so many as eight non-executive directors which also to be paid? You've got five executive directors I should think that's adequate with one or two outside directors to bring outside knowledge or experience but, er thirteen is too many I suggest. Er well there are a number of, of points there and I'll, I'll try and cover them all. The first you asked again about, er, directors' salaries er, or directors' er er remuneration erm, and I would only say that all the directors are er bonuses are linked to earnings per share. Er, I hoped I'd made clear that if the profits of Pearsons erm er not only if they went down but even if er, there was only a small erm, increase in earnings per share er next year that the the directors' salaries would be very considerably reduced and I thought I'd already made that erm, er, directors' erm remuneration total take home pay would be considerably reduced thought I'd already made that point. Erm on er, Alton Towers which you brought up again er the question is where do you stop? Er, it isn't just Alton Towers, it's whether you should get discounts on Penguin Books it was whether you got, er, bottles of Chateau le Tour erm it, it requests for many different things and, er,you know, alright er, it we could, we could, if Alton Towers seemed to be what, er, all shareholders wanted er, perhaps we, we could consider that but, but, but we do have a number of a attractive products. Erm er your third point was about the balance sheet and I think I'd ask the finance director Yes we, we will give consideration to that of course erm Sorry, can I Apologies. Erm we will, course we will give consideration to erm a further issue which I think is what you were asking us to do. All that does, in effect, as you know is i i is reduce the unit price share price, it has no other effect erm a and I think it's purely cosmetic myself and nowadays I think a share price of around seven hundred P which is, er where the shares are currently hovering, is not e enormously disproportionate but of course we'll keep it under consideration. Erm and your last point was about, erm, er the number of directors and particularly er, outside directors, non-executive directors. Well all I can say is that, erm Sir Simon was being extremely modest when he said that the development of this company er, has been due er, entirely to the executive directors. That that isn't actually the case erm the non-executive directors have been enormously helpful in, er, the field of strategy in giving the executive advice er they play a very full er, role in the develop er m development of the company and erm they also er, keep the er executives, er, in order. Who would sack me? Ch chairman, I wonder if I may just add to that I'm sure you know that the Bank of England the Bank of England have made a very strong point that on balance there should be more non-executive directors than executive directors in the company and, er it is felt very strongly that to get a good mix of non-executive directors really does protect the shareholders' interests and, er I think we're very much following the lead, er, of the Bank of, of England, erm, in this particular respect. And I think that we are very lucky in the very high calibre of non-executive directors we've been able to attract. Name, sir. On Saturday afternoon last What? Your name! Oh sorry. , same as jam! Er, it's very difficult, yes you all laughed when I asked a question last year from over there to get a capital P in Pearson because you all laughed it took twenty weeks to get it in The Times, do you remember? Right. Now we've got a company secretary he is er, an F C I S Chartered Institute Secretaries that's much better than a chartered accountant, they're no damn good as secretaries, right! And the L L B people really they're not up to much, are they? Now this chap is supposed to have constructive commonsense forensic ability, what do we mean,the police? Affability to laugh off his twenty week delay in getting my capital P! Right. Now can we look at his pay cos you all been busy on the directors' pay and this chartered secretary is really important and so that he could be available on a Saturday afternoon if he was wanted. Well now, the problem you say it's emotional shall I say it was blasphemous, it was Rushdie. Now, erm, the situation there was that my vicar came to see me and, erm, what happened was that we've got three churches well luckily, one of them only has about twelve in it another has eighty and another sixty and he said well what did he do about Rushdie? And so well I didn't like what he was doing but at any rate it happened on Sunday morning er, somebody read the lesson and it was Saint, Saint John and there were chapters and of course it was skipping about the verses all over the place, you just got fed up with verses. Right he then went to the pulpit and he said that he was gonna preach about Lazarus actually but he's a quiet fellow and he shouted at the top of his voice I'm speaking about satanic bondage! Er, Mr Yes, is er that blasphemous? er,n what, what, er, er, I think you need to do is ask your question because er Oh right to have a narratable speech is not in order I'm so sorry. yes, yes right. Is erm do we know anything about Rushdie or anything? Another point is, up in Hull in October er, somebody wrote a book about Mahatma Ghandi and he got death threats so the vice chancellor of Hull University he's in Fenners he's a director of J H Fenners in industrial. So I suggest the secretary rings up the secretary of Fenners don't say you're listed in newspapers cos industrial people don't like that but have a word with Fenners and they'll tell you what's gone on. So, what is your question? The question is can a small shareholder do anything for Rushdie, am I doing damage for Pearson? I'm trying Mm. to help Pearson Mm. not pick it to bits over its directors' salaries. Er, well thank you for your offer of help it is, er i i i i it's er er clearly a very difficult issue, there are erm, there are important issues of principle er, in, er conflicting directions it is not an easy one and erm er er er I don't er, really know that there is anything er that, er any shareholder of Pearsons is able to do about it. Thank you. Are there any further questions? Thank you. Well I will now put the resolution to the meeting those in favour would they raise their hands thank you those against there is nobody so I can declare it carried unanimously. Thank you very much. Erm the next matter is the re-election of the retiring directors and a separate resolution is required for each one er I've asked Mr to propose the first resolution. I propose that Mr J H , a director, retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. Right. Thank you Mr . I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against? Thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Mr to propose Sir Simon . I propose that Sir Simon , a director retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. Put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Er Mr I propose that Mr , a director retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried. Mr . Er, I'd like to propose that Mr J C , a director retiring in accordance with article eighty of the company's Articles of Association be and is hereby re-elected a director of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Erm we now come to the appointment of the auditors and the question of their remuneration. Under the provisions of the Companies Act Nineteen Eighty Five their appointment er, requires the annual approval of the shareholders. I therefore propose that Coopers and Lybrand be and are hereby appointed auditors to the company, to hold office from the conclusion of this meeting until the conclusion of the next meeting er, of the company at which accounts are laid for the company in accordance with section two four one Companies Act Nineteen Eighty Five and that their remuneration for this period be fixed by the directors. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against? Thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Well, that concludes the business of the A G M and, er it's now twelve forty and er we can move straight on to deal with the business of the extraordinary general meeting. Erm you already had, er, the opportunity to read my letter of the eighteenth of April er, circulated with the report and accounts, which fully explains the proposals being put forward and which are for firstly increasing the authorized share capital of the company creating two new classes of preference share er, renewing the board's authority to allot shares renewing the board's power to modify preemption rights authorizing the company to purchase its own er, ordinary shares reducing the company's share capital by repaying the existing preference shares er, making certain amendments to the company's employee share schemes increasing the aggregate sum available for directors' fees and authorizing the company to issue summary financial statements. Erm I hope that the, er, circular er pretty fully explains er, these proposals but, er if there are er, questions er, I would be very pleased to answer them. Well, if there aren't any questions er, I would return to the resolutions, er, separately and I would propose the first one which is an ordinary resolution namely it's resolution one, set out in the notice of meeting to increase the authorized share capital of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against? I declare the resolution carried, it's an ordinary resolution. Erm secondly I propose a special resolution, resolution two, set out in the notice of the meeting to create and allot fifty thousand preference shares of U S dollars, a hundred er, each and a hundred billion er, preference shares of one pound each er, I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against? I declare the er, er special resolution er, carried. Erm I propose that ordinary resolution, resolution three set out in the notice of the meeting to grant authority to the board to exercise the powers of the company to allot ordinary shares er, this is an annual er, event I put the resolution to the meeting, those in favour any against? I declare the, er, resolution carried as an ordinary resolution. Erm next I propose as a, er, resolution four which is a special resolution and s set out in the notice of the meeting and is to modify to a limited extent, the obligations relating to the allotment of shares for cash contained in section eighty nine of the Companies Act. Er I put the resolution to the meeting, those in favour any against? I declare the resolution carried as a special resolution. Next resolution five which is an ordinary resolution er, set ou set out in the notice of the meeting which is to authorize the company to make market purchases of the ordinary shares of the company. This again is an annual. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution, er, carried er,as an ordinary resolution. Er resolution six is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting and is to reduce the company's share capital by repaying the five erm hundred and one thousand, three and a half percent cumulative preference shares of one pound, er, each at par. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour S I well I asked for questions before, Mr , but erm what is your question? Why is there a need, sir, to repay the five hundred and one thousand pounds of the three and a half percent cumulative pref shares it's quite a low interest involved. What a low interest share? Well this gives us the ability er, for a tidying up operation but the finance director will give more details. Thank you very much. It's helpful in the context of the dollar preference shares we want to issue because one of the factors of this very small, and as you say cheap er, historic issue of preference shares is that, er no preference shares other than those can be repaid prior to that and the dollar shares we wish to issue which are permanent shares, can be er, can be erm repaid at our option and we do want to keep that flexibility in the context of either if interest rates get very high or if the tax treaty between the U S and the U K changes to make them more onerous on the company and in those circumstances we would be inhibited by the existence of this small historic issue of preference shares and therefore it is on balance, although you're quite right there, a cheap er, source of capital in themselves it is helpful to the company in the wider sense I believe if they are repaid. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against declare the resolution er, carried as a special resolution. Er, next is resolution seven which is an ordinary resolution set out in the notice of the meeting, and it is to authorize the directors to amend the company's employee share schemes in the manner set out in the circular dated eighteenth of April nineteen ninety to members of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried as an ordinary resolution. Erm resolution eight er, set out in the notice of the meeting to increase the aggregate annual sum available for directors' fees to two hundred and fifty thousand pounds I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried as an ordinary re resolution. Erm finally, resolution nine which is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting er, and it's to alter the company's articles to enable the company to issue summary financial statements. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against thank you very much, I declare the resolution carried as a special reso resolution. Erm, that concludes the business of the extraordinary general meeting erm, thank you very much for attending and making it a lively meeting and, erm, my colleagues and I will be pleased to, erm meet you in the foyer er, where refreshments are being served. Thank you very much. long summer break. I just want you to remember the video, someone you don't know is a? Stranger. Right. You don't take sweets you to don't don't take drinks, presents money or Don't take anything. That's right, don't take anything. You don't get in someone's car cos someone you don't know is a? Stranger. What can one say? They know it already Miss. You've been here lots of times too haven't you. You told us before. I know I have, yes I know I have. been here loads of times. And we've watched, and we've watched the video before. Shh shh shh. And we've watched the video before, yes, and we keep learning and we keep coming to tell you don't we? Because it keeps happening, boys and girls in their summer holiday keep get getting taken away by people they don't know and nasty things done to them. So all we want you to do is remember the video remember Pippin yeah? And play safely till you come back to school next term. Play safe and never go with strangers. Strangers. Like James did. never. Like that James did, yes that little boy of three, James did didn't he? Two. Two or three whatever, I've just been Two corrected. Alright. Two. Who's James? Thank you Miss. Thank you. Will you do one thing before you go though class? Will you promise me when you go home tonight you be the teachers and your mum and dad be the children and you tell them all about Stranger Danger and you tell them you're never gonna go with strangers and see what your mum and dad says to you. Yeah, will you do that for me? Yeah. Well done. They don't live with me. Oh I always tell him that. Good man. Thank you very much indeed, thanks for your time. See you later class. Okay,le let's get started! We're, we're going to conclude now the discussion of the various ways in which, bacteria, in particular er lead to the production of infective disease and really to centre round, centres round the discussion of the pathogenesis, that is the mechanism by which the disease is produced and lunanspach. And I hope to run through today, basically, a set of examples of specific infective positions which show particular virulence factors er manifest themselves in terms of clinical disease. We start with er er a fine and exciting topic for Monday morning the topic of boils and in their finalist form they're shown here as starike. But, the sa the very same organisms responsible for that relatively moderate appearance can also produce blocked er region of Prince Charles, the carbuncle with which in it's most er florid form can break down and produce the series, but really effectively interconnecting . If we sample one of these cavities in which the process is er which produce boils er are going on, almost inevitably we find this organism staphylococcusorius and offspotulates have been clearly fulfilled with organism and this disease most notably by a bunch of of medical students who are subjected to all sorts of tortures by their professor of microbiology back in the nineteen fifties. And over the years it's been possible to identify a number of factors produced by these bacteria that seem to make sense in terms of the pathology and the conditions. Now the pathology is by a chief information and i in fact, the chief information could be provoked merely by the presence of organisms. You will, you will recognise from your immunology that the presence is certainly foreign antigenic materials can lead immediately to, to the acute alternatives. But, notable inside er the material that characterises the boils and abscesses, there is a cell death, both of bacteria and of the both the defending cells and the structural cells. And, to a very large extent tri cell death can be related to the ability of staph orius to produce elicit toxins, toxins which actually leave the cell death and . But the characteristic of this puss forming organism is that the legions it produces are wooled off, that is they're relatively localized. And although the er, the causal relationship is not completely established, it is a very helpful way of remembering that one of the principle distinguishing features of this organism which separates it from other members of the genus staphylococcus it pr it produces this enzyme to coagulate things on and the effects of this enzyme are illustrated here as against the control preparation, you see a clot form due to the action of this enzyme on clotting practice which has been put into this test tube serum. So this is almost certain a virulence factor but is also very useful in differentiating pathogenic species of staphylococci from non-pathogenic species. And, as as you'll be hearing in later er stages of the course there are many non-pathogenic species of staphylococci. It's worth also mentioning, since you saw it in the practical class, that staphylococci in general produce this enzyme catalase all of these er lo thi this is the enzyme which breaks down hydrogen peroxide and detoxifies it. All of these factors together lead us an to recognise as it a puss forming organism which is often recognised by the term hyogenic organism, ability to produce puss in er the form of reactions it initiates. Now I want at least, to intro introduce the possibility in the series of diagrams I'm going to show you in this lecture that we can relate it to the four stages of pathogenesis that we, we outline briefly er, in the last lecture. The first stage being the establishment, the next stage being penetration, the third stage being damage, what actually produces the damage in the disease, and the fourth stage is, if the disease is going to last for any period of time the ability of the organism to persist. I'm going to introduce this abbreviated momentictiture here in the hope that during the course of the lecture I'll be able to add comments about which of these factors lead to which of these results. Er, but if we run out of time and I find we haven't we we we can't fit it all in I'd like you all to attempt to do this for yourselves after er, the lecture is over. Okay? So, establishment for staphylococcusorius is often not an important feature because in the majority of infections we're talking about an endogenous infection, the organism was there in the first place. Penetration in many instances is not related to a property of the organism itself, in most instances it's re related to some form of injury in which the organism is moved from it's normal skin location to a deep tissue location. So we won't mention these factors here, although in in some instances er, these properties are important to talk about for staph orius. The damage, is fairly obvious to see is produced by these two and it's worth pointing out that persistence can be related to this catalase enzyme. Staphylococci have some degree of resistance to killing by phagocytes and yo you should recall that phagocytes er, one of the mechanisms by which phagocytes kill intercellular organisms is the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and catalase is one of the ways that these can detoxified and th there's fairly good evidence that the catalase enzyme enables er,staph orius to persist. Okay. So, that's, that's the first example of a very common condition. Let's move on now to consider a very important type of infection such as meningitis. You recognise by particularly common in children not recognised by the particular posture that they adopt and extended neck, rigid neck due to the inflammation of le , lymphees which I will resist being a reflection of the neck, completely rigidly. It's a disease which, if it a , they're fortunate enough to re , recover from the disease, if it's been severe enough the inflammation may have involved er, some of the cranial nerves, and here we can see a third nerve palsy er as a result of er, the process. If you take a sample er, of ce the cera cereblis fluid during the course of acute bacteria meningitis you will find it's drowning, drowning, not due the fact that it's an organism, but present, being due to the presence of puss cells. This is another biogenical fluid and, in about a third of the cases you will find this, very faintly with them Mm mm. which you can just about see here a in conjunction with the puss cells with which it is busily the life and death, life and death tackle. This organism is the fastidious grand negative rod you saw in the erm practical class innocuous influenzi. And it is a a very important pathogen responsible for about a third of the cases of meningitis in in this country almost exclusively in children. Now, the process we recognise in the pa pathogenesis of meningitis due to this organism is as follows, first of all and then it is able, by, mechanisms not completely described but we could probably involve this transpschycosis er phenomenon that er, I I briefly mentioned last time. First of all, penetrates from the into the bloodstream and then into the cerebral spinal fluid. Now the basis for the pathogenesis is not well enough established for us to expect you to understand the details of how it achieves these processes, but one thing which is remarkably clear is that the organism is a capsule producing organism and that once it gets into the er cerebral spinal fluid that predominately is an acute inflammatory . We do recognise establishment factors, that is adhesions in this part of the process and it is very clear that the capsule is one of the factors which allows the organism to pe , persist because it helps the organism to resist phagocytosis. You'll notice that the damage in this instance is actually the result of the acute inflammatory response, not particularly some form of direct noxious effect of the organism, so the contribution of the host is absolutely critical. Now, the reason we we focus on the capsule as illustrated on the right here is that hymophylus have many different capsular types, but but only one type appears to be associated with meningitis. This type B capsule refers to a particular pulse and has it's so important in the pathogenesis of the capsule that antibodies to it can be used er,ca , er can actually completely prevent the disease and we end up with a capsule vaccine based on the type B pulse . Plus, referencing with the other two organisms which produce meningitis in, in humans it is very prominent that both of these, licea meninigitipitus and staphylococcus are also very prominent capsule mechanisms. Hello! That's like the type. H I for hymopholus influenzi. And that's, that H I is actually the th th H, H I B is the acronym for the vaccine. There's a new vaccine introduced last October which is being er, used for the first time in this country to prevent meningitis in children. Is that just the name of the vaccine? H, well H I B is a, an abbreviation for the strain of hymopholus that produces the infection, but the name of the vaccine the H I B vaccine, yeah. Okay? I should say that a, a lot of this information will be covered again during this course, what I'm trying to do now is to bring together the the themes in a pathogenesis of infection that I introduced last week into the practical context of clinical infections. And to to, to try and illustrate to you why we focus on particular virulence factors for particular organisms. Move on now to to look at an area that's er not frequently er doesn't impinge a great deal on life in this country but it certainly does for travellers and for many people in the developing world. This is the topic of secretory diarrhoea produced by infective agents. This is a dramatic disorder of the small intestine which produces a massive outflow of water electrolytes that can be fatal within a matter of hours after the onset of disease! We recognise two agents which are er, responsible in bacterial causes of this process,th there are many others but these are certainly the most important. choleri, the cholera vacilus and er, an acronym here, ETEC, I wouldn't worry about taking down the full er, er , it actually stands for e entrotoxigenic ecolytes, it's a strain or a group of ecolars that are able to produce this effect. These diseases are common in areas er where an out pouring of water from the individual is squared up with a ou , out pouring of people into the water, then you can appreciate that that transmission is very er, readily promoted under those circumstances. The effects on the, the individual are very dramatic! Dehydration, er can produce death within a matter of fe , er a few hours and and an understanding of the mechanism by which this dehydration leads us into one of the most effective forms of heat treatment er, ever produced. A prominent feature of secretory diarrhoea is that effective and normal bowel in,yo you ca , you can ignore this sign are almost indistinguishable, so despite this dramatic change in the physiology of the small bowel, borthalogically it actually looks quite normal. And you have a normal meconium. Now, the organisms that produce this effect haven't, have this target which is around zero for the choleri , the villi of a small intestine and the both of these organisms have pro prominent adhesion mechanisms. Let's just show you something with that. In an affected small bowel you will see the grey background with these tiny little curved rods present the whole area of the er, the villi is covered by the organisms which are er stuck down effectively by the processes which you ca , you can't really see them in the transmission micrograph, but they are attached to specific receptors on the surface of the entrocite membrane. Once they've got there, the organism really goes no further. Both the cholera organism and the ETEC organism secrete toxins referred to here as C T for cholera toxin and LT for the le Lethane toxin. It is very striking that these toxins are actually almost exactly the same molecule! So that although these are er fairly different relatives in terms of bacteria it's striking that the ETEC organism has been able to acquire in some way almost exactly the same gene that's present in choleri. And, this toxin when released from these tightly organisms disorders the er the physiological activity of the lining cells, the empha cells. The molecular oh we've lost a slide! The molecular basis for this is very well understood and forms one of the important themes in er the effects of e , exotoxin in human cells. This toxin is composed of two components er, of binding components and active component. Binding component binds to specific receptors on the emphacyte and the active component penetrates into the cell and inactivates the controlling mechanism on the production of . And this is the cell that er, is possessed by several other toxins that affect, not just the gut but other parts of the body as well. I should point out that in one of the features of adhesions is that it takes two to tango, so to speak! Where specific adhesions are involved the the , the structures that are, are most commonly associated with a , require a specific receptor for the adhesion reaction to take place and that if the potential host doesn't have specific receptor they're not susceptible to that particular strain of organisms. Okay. Let's move on to look at another fairly dramatic infection which is a case of diphtheria. That, which is er a infection ca characterized by this profuse athema of th the base of the neck, referred to as bull neck if you look inside this child's er pharynx you see this very messy inflammatory process at the back and the whole of the respiratory mucosa is beginning to detach in what's referred to as a pseudo-membrane. In, fatal cases this pseudo- membrane can extend right from the top of the respiratory track here down into bronchi, and you can get these enormous casts of mucrotic material er, starting in the pharynx and working their way right down in the bronchi. It's been known for a very long time that from these cases you can isolate this organism C diphtheria bacterium which you saw in the practical classes and has this distinctive stayed property where er certain granules can be stayed up and also the arrangement of the cells is rather reminiscent of what called Chinese lettering. The picture, the acute picture which you've just seen is virtually exclusively due to the production of a toxin and that toxin produces really a necrotic pharyngitis inflammation of the pharynx associated with necrosis and detachment of what we call the pseudo-membrane. In very severe cases the toxin gets into the blood stream and their paralytic effects toxin i i is to some extent a neuro-toxin, and also there are effects of the heart. So although for the majority of cases that a fatal as a result of diphtheria the fact that , due actually to the pharyngitis and the pseudo- membrane obstructing the respiratory passage. In later stages, the minority of cases may go on to produce these results. Well this is a disease due to another exotoxin which, in practical terms is of importance to you because it's the basis for a test for identifying the . The toxin may or may not be present in strains of er C diphtheria and this is just an immunological test so I wo won't explain it in detail but what you can see is a a strip of er, filter paper which has been bathed in anti-toxin and growth of various different strains of the organism erm which, some of which do produce the toxin you can see lines of precipitation here and some of which don't produce the toxin. And that test has to be applied to es each eyslate because this toxin is not part of the genome of Cherani bacteria diphtheria, it's actually a farged mediated toxin, it's actually encoded for by a bacteria farged. So when What's paresis then? Paresis, paralysis. Oh! I thought you were doing neuro-sciences course? The as I said this, this is required for identification for the organism, but the to the toxin has been recognised for a very, very long time and right from er, the early days the possibility of inactivating the biological properties of a toxin while retaining their immunological properties has been attractive to people seeking to prevent these diseases. And, if you treat this toxin with something like formaldehyde or ethanol, you end up by inactivating it's toxic properties and you end up with what, what we call a toxoid, something that retains immunological properties, it's able to stimulate specific immunity to the toxin but it doesn't have any of the toxic effects and we end up with this toxoid vaccine against diphtheria. And all of you, I would expect, have received the toxoid vaccine against diphtheria. Curiously it has led effectively to the irradification of Cherani bacterium diphtheria from the circulating respiratory flora in this country and the reasons for that are are quite obscure! Another im prominent toxoid vaccine which you should all have received and be regularly receiving boosters for is the tetanus vaccine, and really, a very similar situation pertains here, that the toxin is so important in the pathogenesis of disease, tetanus, that simply immunity to that one factor can lead to immunity er to the disease as a whole. So, I've gone through a series of examples of exotoxins I want to just er, as far as is possible summarize the general properties of exotoxins. First thing to be said about them is that they're all proteins covering a very wide range of molecular weights between three and three hundred kilobocals three thousand to three hundred thousand bocals. And they have very specific impacts because they all result their effective result on an interaction with a specific receptor and er an activity I would express on that receptor or as a result of the er erm the uptake of the toxins. Consequently,. As I've indicated before you can divide them into patha and physiological effects and membrane damage more specifically than what I said before membrane damage is the i i is a particularly important thing. Your patha and physiological toxins are often sub-unital structure and they make the most, the momegictiture most widely used is an A plus B sub-unit structure. The B is a receptor and A is often, although by no means always, an enzyme and in the case the cholera toxin rotusis toxin and several other erm pseudo-membrane toxins and several others, diphtheria toxin they have the specific A viral I think they put the group onto a target molecule and disorder itself . The membrane doesn't use toxins like the lytic toxins that staphylococcusorius expressed er they're often detected by their immunelytic properties, see the in the er, in the bacterial passage. I'm sure you've experienced in many instances here, the effect of lytic toxins in er a boil or some some other unpleasant minor lesion! Gonna go on now to talk about a severe condition which may start out that with a minor skin rash like this, this is called a petechial skin rash they later progress to rather more generalised rash and in it's most severe form it's mucrotic effects on the skin and er, obviously a lethal outcome! This type of picture is almost exclusively related to the isolation of grand negative organisms from the blood, these may be phacili or cocci, doesn't really make any er, any difference. It's the grand nega negative cell wall structure that seems to matter. And we now know that these ghastly effects are the results of what we referred to in the last lecture endotoxins. You will hear in considerable detail in a later lecture about how septic shock and endotoxin work. At this stage it's worth remarking that wa there are perhaps three prominent features of endotoxin effects first of all, they promote physcocine release and th the the two pro , prominent phsycocines affected are I O one, Interlooping one and TMF, tumourmacrosis factor which I hope you heard about in the immunology course. I O one is the molecule most closely associated with the mi , the effects of lodose endotoxin and that is fever I O one er, when released into the blood sys bloodstream affects the hypothalamus and th i one of the principle reasons why infective conditions lead to fever. In more severe situations there's uncontrolled continent acto activation and uncontrolled clotting factor, activation and it's really that last feature that's particularly responsible for the er er ghastly skin disease you saw i in the last sla , in the previous slide! Now the eff the endotoxin as I've is almost exclusively associated with the grand negative cell wall. And again in abbreviated form that, I just want to take you through the molecular basis for endotoxin action. Here is the positive wall with it's large er expansive petroglycan grand negative with an inner and an outer membrane, and the petroglycan sandwiched in between. Here we have a diagram of a grand negative organism with it's inner membrane and outer membrane illustrated here. Very easy to reproduce endotoxic shock in in experimental animals and er, it was found fairly early on that the effects, er the endotoxic effects were almost exclusively associated with the outer membrane. And detailed chemical strains of the outer membrane show that it has a slightly different structure from normal unit membranes. Expand that up, you'll end up with a normal inner leaflet to the membrane, a phospholipids but the outer the , er the outer layer is almost exclusively composed of this stuff, lycropolysacrulite I mentioned this in an earlier lecture but we need to go into in a little bit more detail . This lycropolysacrulite is can then be broken up into three different sections the internal membrane section is referred as lipid A. Lipids in general are not very antigenic erm er it's interesting to note that lipid A, when it's purified from the other components is almost totally responsible for the toxic amount of any property. The polysacurised component of composed of a four region to which the lipids are attached, and that outer region is er, it extends out into the environment . Now, the importance here is that both of these polysacrulite components are based in general the outer region is highly variable, that's to say that very, er that most of organisms possess a unique outer region to that polysacrulite . And by contrast, the poor region, certainly amongst the grand negative bacilli is very similar across a wide range of different species and this provides a very important opportunity to produce immunity to endotoxin directed against the core and this possibility has recently been exploited by a production of the molecule antibody directed against the core polysacride of the erm er er, of ecoli. So, this has been shown to be effective in moderating the toxic events which occur in grand negative shock. Building on this approach and something which I think you'll see certainly during the course of your your medical studies antibodies directed against tumourler proce , tumourler process factor are now being used to try and interrupt the chain of events at a slightly later stage. So that's that's the endotoxin story. I want now just to summarise and er some of these the features I'm going to point out I've I've already stated so you may may just want to sit back and just take this in. If we compare endo and exotoxins endotoxins are only associated with grand negative organisms whereas exotoxins maybe produced by either grand negative or grand positive. Endotoxins are exclusively cell associated in their production. Exotoxins may also be cell associated, they've, they may not be a sa , they're not a structural component, but, particularly in grand negatives exotoxins er, are released first into the peraplasmic space, the space between the two membranes, and the the actual release into the medium er, may require cell . So,tha they are both cell associated and cell free. Endotoxin from different organisms although it may be of of different potency has essentially the same biological effects. So, a wide variety of different organisms can produce endotoxic shock. But exotoxins from different organisms produce really very different biological effects. Even, even though they may be er,the they may work as a result of different o of the same enzyme activity in some cases the target for that enzyme activity and the receptors that have put it into the specific cells that are targeted lead to really very different biological effects. In general terms endotoxins are a very low potency about point O one of a gram is lethal to one person some exotoxins are incredibly potent, and they're being the, the subject of er a certain amount of er weapons research. The same goes for O one of a gram for example,toxin and it gives you a hundred thousand er as as I've indicated here, there's a, a wide range for the potency. Endotoxins are heat stable, and this is very important when we try to produce materials that are safe for intravenous injection. Whereas, for the most part exotoxins are destroyed by heat into a hundred degrees centigrade. And finally treatment with er formaldehyde or ethanol has no effects on endotoxins but in a number of instances formaldehyde or ethanol will lead to er, the production of toxoid. So, I think you should now have a very clear basis for discriminating between the two sorts of two sorts of toxin. And we can move safely on to another another, and the final really, final topic about the patterns of pathogenesis. Let's move on now, briefly, to consider this disease, tuberculosis. This is a, a normal test x- ray the commonest manifestation of tuberculosis is the disease of des destructive regions in the upper poles of the lungs and pathologically the very nasty destructive lesions er, are appearing in in the area. And in a mi , in a minority of cases you may get a sort of forminant region, this is er small scale, it's perhaps a centimetre apart, across a series of lung lesions containing these little necrotic due to the er the presence of tubercle cila. Although this was this organism, microbacterium tuberculosis, named tuberculosis was discovered back in eighteen eighty we we really understand the pathogenesis of the disease very poorly! What we know for sure is is really outlined here. The organism is in i is inspired into the alveolar spaces and it's taken up by alveolar , the standard er abbreviation for macrophage and, the organism i in contrast to many others which we've sort of er die fairly rapidly after being taken up by these phagocytic cells, says Goodee! That was exactly what I wanted to happen! And it grows very rapidly, within macrophages and after er a period of time is actually disseminated into the circulation. Now, this happens in nearly all er cases o of tuberculosis but, interesting, the vast majority of infections microbacterium tuberculosis are asymptomatic and the reason for that is that after a period of growth and dissemination does not lead to clinical symptoms, cell mediated immunity, C M I, comes into comes into play and you end up with a balance between the macrophages, and fi and M T B, where there's a constant turnover of macrophages dying, and M T B winning out. Excuse me! Hello! Yep? What's the M T B? Microbacterium tuberculosis. Okay. Thank you. You have a balance between the effects of macrophages which have been activated by cell mediator immunity and the lethal effects of microbacterium tuberculosis. In individuals in whom some mediated immunity is not well developed the growth and defemination,de defemination phase may take over altogether. If the C M I doesn't lead to this kind of balance then it can have this sort of effect and get rapidly fatal tuberculosis occurring at the time of the primary infection. But it's believed that the majority of cases of tuberculosis, that we actually see, are so called post-primary tuberculosis where all of this process is taking place asymptomatically and the host is in this state of balance but something else comes along and stresses cell mediated immunity and the control breaks down so that th the organism M T B wins out very dramatically over the, over the macrophages and you end up with this post-primary pattern of tuberculosis. An example of th , of the stress might be the administration of steroids or the occurrence of another disease, most notably, in this day and age of course, aids, would lead to T B coming out in this way. Is this a type of miliary ? Miliary er i it it refers, well you've heard of millet seed and it's it refers to a seeding of many different lesions er, around the body it means the disseminated form of of tuberculosis where the lesions occur all over the place. Mm. You'll hear, you'll hear these things repeated many times again, both in the pathology, and in the microbiology course. So, that's er, really a very different pattern of infections where the virulence factors are not clearly identified. Let me just finish off now by illustrating what leads to the outcome and how a a of a particular infectious condition and the combination of the factors that we think lead to these outcomes. I think, the best analogy I can produce for you is that a a balance in which various factors act on the side of the host and various factors act on the side of the organism, and the outcome is disease and death if the organism wins out and outcome is resistance or recovery if the the host wins out. And we could really, add in for each organism in different weights the significance of each of the factors on each side. So, for example, if we took diphtheria we could say that the toxin was by far the most important and weighty factor, and that if we knock the toxin out then the disease can't occur. And, similarly on the the host side, we could say that antibody was the most important feature. In another example in tuberculosis we could say that the ability of the organism to persist inside macrophages was the most important feature and that effective cell mediated immunity was the most important feature on the host side. So, I hope I've introduced to you the very different styles by which microbes produce disease and indicated the balance of factors involved. Shall we start from the beginning? Yes Right, mm, completely fresh start? Yes please. I was born in Wapping in the year nineteen hundred and six, my father was a docker, one of my earliest recollections is of the dock strike of nineteen hundred and eleven, in which I played a part lining up at the soup kitchens to get soup for the family. My father died when I was quite young and at ten years of age I went into a poor old orphanage where I stayed four years. I came out of the orphanage to go and live with my mother and I found myself one of the family of six living in one room, the house was a four roomed house plus a scullery. Each room was occupied by a separate family, there was one cold water tap for the whole of the four families and one outside toilet. Conditions such as those were quite common to many thousands of people and I think it was those conditions which helped to formulate and develop my political thinking. When I was eighteen I came in contact with the Catholic Crusade which was a rather left wing Christian Socialist Organization and I found that their attitude to problems contained the answers for which I had been searching for a good many years tell me when you want me to raise something. Yeah, I'd like you to tell me about erm, what the house was that you left before you came to Harlow and why you came to Harlow? Yes,if we skip all the intermediate years with, after the war I came back from the army to find we'd been bombed out and were living in requisition accommodation, after a time, the, we were moved into a new flat over some shops. My wife was working for Cossors the electronic company and they moved to Harlow and er, it, in order for her to retain her job, we had to move to Harlow as well. This proved very difficult because, between the time of the decision being taken to move Cossors to Harlow and the time that my wife, my wife's department actually went, the Development Corporation had changed their policy and would not have married women as tenants. This resulted in a great deal of correspondence between myself and the Development Corporation and at the end of it I told my wife the best thing to do was to hand her notice in as there was no chance of us ever getting a house in Harlow, fortunately her services were much more seriously in demand then we imagined and the company nominated us for one, a house which is allocated to one of their executives, the house that we're living in now and have lived in ever since nineteen sixty three. The vast difference between Stroud Green Road, Islington and Harlow. For one thing Harlow is the sort of town which I'd been agitating for both before and after the war whenever I was speaking on behalf of the Labour Party both at street corners and at public meetings on the type of life we vis envisaged for a normal person in the land. To leave Islington, to leave Stroud Green Road, to leave a flat which was over a shop overlooking a main shopping centre, overlooking a completely noisy main through road to come to Harlow was a difference between chalk and cheese. The accommodation differed in, in one respect and that, that was that in the flat we were on one floor, we had one bedroom, we moved into a house with two toilets separate bathroom and three bedrooms, which enabled us to spread our furniture around, enabled us to have visitors to receive members of the family. I think this is one of the essentials in Harlow and something that people should not forget, that is that, although there is a great deal of criticism possibly of the standard of building that went on over the years of the Development Corporation, compared with what most people came from, there was a very great elevation both in quality and in ideas. Perhaps today the general public take too much for granted, the, as a local Councillor I have to interview many people who come to me with housing problems, to be as patient as one can is essential as a politician, but after the complainant has gone, one is very conscious of the fact that their problem is so minute it is hardly worth mentioning. But nevertheless that's human nature and perhaps it's also a reason why life should not stand still, whatever progress we make both in housing and in quality of housing and the quality of life, once people are used to that, to that they expect more and this is what progress, what forward thinking is all about. Could you tell me about the house, of which you were bombed out? Was it, were you married at the time? Yes I think that over the course of our married life we had a number of moves for various reasons, generally to improve the accommodation, erm as standard of life increased so the desire to have a better house to live in or rather in those days a house was out of the question, we generally had rooms in a house, erm, they, the flat for instance that we were bombed out from was a basement flat, erm according to the estate agents it was a garden flat, erm and it meant that you had access to the front garden and the back garden, but as for being a garden flat it was below the level of the garden in the front and at the back it was on the level with the erm green grass at the back of the house, it was also along side of the trolley bus depot, so there it was considerably noisy, nevertheless it was a self contained flat, the first one we'd had, no the second one we'd had and we were perfectly happy there although of course it did have minor difficulties, the fact that you used the front door with people who had flats on the other remaining three floors, but nevertheless it did involve you in a certain amount of community living, you were aware of your neighbours, you had to be very conscious of them and they were very conscious of you. That I think perhaps is one of the striking differences between that and living in a house in Harlow, where you may or may not know your immediate neighbours. Perhaps you know them over the garden wall to speak to you, you might even know their children by name and you know their christian name, but beyond that I think it's true to say, even making allowance of generation gaps that you don't know your neighbours in the same way that you knew your neighbours in London. Whereabouts was the basement flat, was it in Islington No , that was in Islington but it was in the district called Holloway Oh yes I know it well Mm Penventon Gardens Penventon Gardens, is the hou oh of course it's not there It's not there, mm, yeah if it was bombed out yes You were in the army weren't you? Oh I was yes, I was Army I was enjoying life in the army while my wife was enjoying the bombing. She was actually in the house when the bomb dropped on the other side of the road and she was flung down two flights of stairs and the piano on the other side of the room here bears the scars of the bombing. And that curtain went from the window right across the room and pinned itself into the piano, pinned the curtains into the piano. And it also managed to chip some of the woodwork, curious to think that I was offered as war damage compensation five pounds to re-case the piano, you couldn't of had it repolished for five pounds, but thinking was working class people shouldn't have pianos, I'm certain that was at the back of, of the gentleman whose job it was to evaluate war damage, he certainly raised his eyebrows every time we told him, what either a piece of furniture or crockery or cutlery which had been destroyed had cost and he was so foolish after er the house had been almost flattened as de demand bills as proof of evidence that your figures were correct Mm, so when you left your, when you came back you said that you went into You see it in the crisp industry, they're all Yes. they're all well No salted crisps. We were well to be fair, first i Times I got that in. ha , how can I say, what,whe when you're talking about fa , I mean fast moving consumer good are fast Mm. moving off the shelves and into the shop and, what we would do was erm deli people now do er, stock an order by computer and, and people like Sainsburys were doing that in the seventies, you know, and they would actually work over er work on erm data erm, from their computer and order er erm you know, okay, they'd be an event at the weekend or something and they'd, they'd of, increase it or something, but they would technically work out exactly what the throughput of certain items were. And it goes through the till now doesn't it? Yeah. Well, yes, they have a comput yes they have the computer software. In my, in my day probably someone did it a little bit off that, different Maybe. but the, but the proce , the, er the, the whole thing works on the same principal but now they're doing it without, with less effort. Now what I'm saying is, is the retail trade or the sharp end of th , you know,i it's, it's very much, it's staying alive. If you over stock, you're dead! You know I mentioned Yes. the manufacturing point, from that end, not from the end- user to get the products, to, to the retail Yeah. outlets, I meant that Ye , you're probably right. But I mean to be fair we used to we, warehouse thousands of tons of potatoes in Leicestershire, you see what I mean? We've made Yeah. we make er, you know you feel, ah my factory we thinks looking at Like a . see looked at, looking, looking, look how we treat our potato, aren't they gorgeous! You know, and tha , we wouldn't go and have a look at a parcel machine system we'd look at lovely potatoes,. And Marks and Spencers use the same potato. Can you just get your girls to wear their hats on each layer and we'll have your potato,the , you know, that's how you used to get the Marks, get their Marks and Spencers account. A , but what I'm sa ,wha the point you were making Adrian, is tha , is is that's what you've gotta keep in mind about every time you walk into a business or phone up a business, that it does matter that it's in, your, that's not what we want cos I'm telling you, you know, don't you know, the security guys photographing, you know, lampposts and stuff like that. But if it's a bolt that holds a lamppost down and they've under under-ordered, there's not, but they're with them, then we can take those. The other thing is, is docu , documents are the same. If, there are, there are industry working to deadlines all the time. I in Terry was just mentioning his wife's business, in advertising, d'ya, would sell the advertising space in your feature or your magazine or whatever try and get the bleeders to send you that what they wanna put in it! A friend of mine sends things like that and they gotta be and the proofs have to be sent. Honestly! You know. Oh trying to get companies to decide how they're gonna say, what they're gonna say, coming up with art work ideas and whatever. And it was always to,ye , you know, you ask a commercial artist what sort of lead time, that's another, another er another word that you might come across, because again, you don't want them to speak our jargon but we can speak there's. You know, if I said to Terry's wife, Mrs , how much lead time do you need to set up your show? What would she say? What does sh , what do I mean by lead time? To set it up , the amount of time it takes her to get it up, be prepared That's right. for it. what about we , and if I, if one of her suppliers I asked them, if I said well okay, if we feature your outfit here, how much lead time you ne , do you need from order to production? What do I now mean? If I place the order today how much lead time do you want? What do I mean? Actually the time from er Time. when the order placed to the, when it's gonna be on the rack and ready. In i , actually in my shop is what I mean. Now It doesn't work that way in the rag trade that. Remember I was saying to you about the whole of the rag trade? I know it's gonna cost sending them by the way. Mhm. And the rag trade was also upside down ready on the trailer to come across, I won't bore you with the way they do their budgeting for example, but what happens is, my wife will go to one of those suppliers and say yes, a number of my people want to buy that dress so we want a thousand of them. And I want them on, such and such a day. Alright. That's no problem. It's not Fine. how long does it take you, what's your lead time? So really what's the, what You get it there on time. What, what you're saying is, is the lead, if I ask that question then now they would say,tha when, when do you want it? That's right. It's like, if you go to, I've heard, I've not been, but if you go to Hong Kong, you can have a suit made overnight. Yeah? Yeah. That's a tailor-made, handmade suit that is stitched Mm mm. overnight. And shirts. And shirts made. In Thailand while you wait. Cos they will just say, they'll just sit down and make it. Measure you up make it cos they want the money. Cos, that's what they need. Because labour, there's loads of it and it's very cheap. And really, what the rag trade's famous for is labour, very cheap. And that's why they can Stretch it. That's right. And that's why they can You've been watching House of Elliot. What I'm saying is, that's why they respond in that way, which, in in other industries and comp , businesses, er, we have different er, things to consider don't we? Like arranging where they're bought and so on. Now T N T do something, when d'ya want it? We'll get it there. We'll get it there. Because, I mean, if we can't do it through T N T overnight i , if tomorrow's too late who do we use? And if they say well, we want erm seventy five different locations served with crisps stands by ten o'clock tomorrow because our advert is going out on national T V tomorrow can we do it? Yeah. And we then go and recruit, we'll go the, you know, we'll go to the job centres and get them. Mm. Or, they'll turn round, if the money's, if the money is big enough, they'll turn round to anybody who works for us and say, d'ya wanna join us? Come and join us. Get your kit on and do a bit, d'ya know what I mean? And they'll just ask people to partake and we'll get it done. If it's, if it's, feasible we'll get it done. And that's the sort of ethos that T N T's got. But we're likely to make more money at it than perhaps the sweat shops do. So what I'm saying is, is lead time in lots of business is highly valuable but if you can cut down the delivery time and give them more lead time you're actually extending Yeah. the lead time by tightening up and this is where your time deliveries come in. Because, although it's before nine erm, the next morning erm you're actually giving them now more lead time, you've given them another day because an , sometime tomorrow you know, if it gets there at two o'clock and it's off-loading in in in at the bay and someone checks that it's been received and then someone makes a phone call to tell them it's there, and then they're doing something else, and then they come down and have a look at it, how many boxes do you think are sitting on loading bays that don't get looked at for a day or two, or three, or four, five when they've had a next day service? Quite a few. Quite a few. Mm. My other half ordered from a catalogue disc drives to assemble compu , er a home computer and he was looking very carefully cos computer parts can be quite expensive and he was looking at national catalogue for the best prices. He knew exactly what he wanted, or, or the range of things he wanted, and the price that he, he was price conditioned and working out which was the best price, priced package. And oh! Look at that place in Southampton, can do me a disc drive for two hundred quid or whatever it was, I don't know why but I can't remember the price, but let's keep it at two hundred pound, And he phoned them up and said oh your price is very good on that one. Right. Yes it is. There's a lot of people ordering that one. Okay then, can I have one? Yes he said. That will be two hundred pounds plus V A T, plus thirty pounds carriage. He said thirty pounds? That's a hell of a lot to be asking, you know, why is it so much? Oh it's express. He said right, oh so I'll have it tomorrow? He says, no it takes thirty days to get here. Sorry it wasn't thirty days, ten days to get here. What service does he need Carly? I can deliver to you next day, but it takes him ten days to get it here, what service does he need? Mm? Before nine. Before nine. Mm. Say it again louder. Carriage forward. Carriage forward. It's called carriage Can you forward. co can you explain to those who don't know what it is cos it's Yeah. a, it's a stupid name isn't it? Carriage forward. Sounds like the, talk about the horse before the ca , the cart before the horse. In the first place you've got three companies, A B and C C's your manufacturer D'ya wanna draw, do you want to draw it on here? Yeah, wait a minute. You got three companies A, B and C. Erm we'll call B the carrier sort of like the go between if you like A, is your say, shop and C is your manufacturer. Now you may have a customer that comes into the shop at A and they need something desperately, they walk in the sho , may walk in and say look I need that compact disc player, my life depends on having compact disc player and shopkeeper no see now we haven't got it. But what they can do in this case is the manufacturer's at C, but the manufacturer cannot deliver to the shop until maybe two weeks time they can phone us, the carrier, we will then arrange for someone to go to manufacturer at C, pick it up, bring it to us and then we'll take to the shop. Right. All for a charge of course. Right. So that gives what, to the shopkeeper? Control. Control again. Now what else we could do, well said Customer satisfaction. that's, that's that's well said, but we can also do third party Third party. carriage forward Oh yeah. that's why, that's so that we can give the shop his control of supply which actually like my da , you're saying if it was a computer disc supplier he could have next day delivery to him and then next day delivery to my man. Mm. Right? What we can actually do is suggest to the C, the C D or the computer shop your manufacturer can send directly to Peter via us, I then say via us. Aye, you'll get the bill. Mm mm. But we will send the bill To that shop. you can Mm mm. send them the bill and we'll send them the goods. They, Peter, if he found out where they were coming from what might he do? Phone them. To the supplier. He might cut out the middle man you see. Cos he might be able to go straight to the ba , the Yeah. Now obviously, we don't want to lose his business so we protect him but we don't say it's coming from there. We are, we represent him, it's his delivery van Yeah. that delivers to Peter. And that's third party carriage forward which is even, and Peter's even happier because he doesn't even have to wait two days now, he gets his delivery next day. And the bill he, that he gets at the same as the time as the delivery, and what's normal credit conditions? Thirty days. Thirty days. So when does the thirty days start ticking by? We get our money back much quicker. That's right. You do. So instead of waiting ten days for delivery and then the invoice being,tha , you know being delivered with the goods when you open Yes. it up there's the bill the bill can be eleven days in advance of that which means improved Well that means everybody's happier. The manufacturer's happier That's right. cos he gets his money quicker. Well done. The shopkeeper's happier because he gets Aha. his money quicker. We're happier because we get paid quicker and the end-user's happier cos he's Aha. got his product quicker. That is it. And if the shopkeeper uses our service all the time he doesn't have to carry any stock. Yep. Yeah. Right. Improved cash flow. And if he doesn't have to carry any stock what does that mean with th er in terms of his capital being tied up. It isn't. He can do He could what? Open He could do so something else. Another shop. another shop. Yeah. D'ya see? But d'ya know something? There are businesses out there that don't understand that. They probably don't even know we exist. D'ya know, d'ya know Yeah. why? D'ya know why they don't know it exists? People like shops. I don't know why it is, no. Because nobody has target them. Yeah. That's right. Anthony? I've seen a lot of companies like that Honestly. just recently. Why, why Can I tell you another reason why as well Peter rang this computer because in Southampton and he said we can give you next day this, they won't, they won't enter into it, we can give you next day delivery but it takes ten or twenty days. And I bet you, if you look at how many of your accounts are not using carriage forward when they should you would be amazed. Existing on your roller now. And so, why so many don't know about carriage I know. forward Yeah. They don't understand. That's it. They don't understand what it means. Th ,ca , what do most people use carriage forwards for? Just collecting from somewhere else and bringing it back to themselves. Bringing it back, sending it back. Yeah. Invoice them let me, the o the other thing we can do is if it's broken the shop can send it back but the man, the other person pays. Yeah. Mm. That is also carriage forward. Comes back to the person. And a lot of our carriage forwards are Are returns. Yeah. And then they put in a claim form. Or sometimes they've got an account in your name. And that's why we don't make money on carriage forwards cos we don't sell carriage forwards for the positive reasons, we say, well if they don't want them send them back, or if they're damaged send them back. Yeah. Or if you have to have, I used to do it for erm West Bro , er Northampton Brewery. Banson's Banson's Brewery. Erm, it was, was Banson Brewery. Er no it wasn't Ba , Banson's Brewery, erm Anson's no sorry, I'm I'm in the wrong trade, it was er gas cylinders. And we used to send back the erm The valves. the valves. They used to er se , we couldn't carry the empty ga , you can imagine that's not express parcel stuff, but the valves er, would sometimes need er replacing and we would send them a valve and, and while, instead of having any down time, we would give them you know deliver the spare, have the spare come back for repair. Do you understand? Cos there's a lot of this maintenance thing that goes on as Mm. as well isn't there with businesses? It isn't just service doesn't end at the sale,so , a lot of things have to have after-care don't they? Or Mm. a service contract with them and there's lots of business, repeat business. Another one we did, er, out of South Wales was hip replacement kit Gosh! to erm the hospitals and erm they would appar , I might be wro , I'm sure this is the way she explained it to me cos one of the girls in the branches did explain it to me once, and they said they have a choice of joints, like the doctor would say er New brain. your due to, you know, you, you were due for your hip replacement. Right. And what they would do is have a look and say ooh that's, ooh that's about your size, that's about it. Right. They don't make a joint do they, for you, you, you, you and you? They're all sort of standard sort of size pieces of kit. Cos it's an engineering job really isn't it? Yeah. You know. Yeah. Providing you're looking after the blood supply, I mean, you know, the cardiovascular bit, you know, it's a bit of an engineering job. So they,th , you, you have a choice of hips, and they also have a bit of saw, a bit of sawing kit and screw in, you know, have delicate screws. Cos it's, it is pins and stuff isn't it, that makes Yeah. the hip work? So they have little screws to, you know, to go into the bone and little er delicate instruments which are highly developed instruments and manufactured by certain pattern. And they actually supply them in special sealed containers, you know, little cases that er, so, when you're doing a hip job you have a little kit come from the supplier. And what they do, is they give them a couple of choices of bo , you know, hip joints to go for and the guy decides, the surgeon decides, does his job and then the kit goes back to the manufacturer again and then when the, another hospital orders it they make up a, another kit. Obviously there's a lot of sterilizing going on in the meantime and all this. But they don't, these tools are used again, and again, and again you know. The screws they make are, are to be there in the body and the parts are in the bodies, but the bits they don't use come back and then they are put back into stock again. And our service was so good to hospitals,, that they'd be somebody on the table well where's the bit? Mm. She's just getting her anaesthetic now. Well where's the bits you know? And they're ringing up er Julie about it, and say Julie well, they're here. What's happened? Because the service was so good they'd all, you know, they'd forget about the delivery that would be there. She'd supply them. So it was there? Yes. Already Yeah. there. And then one day it didn't. Can't find this bit. They're always going down for anaesthetic, we can't find it. Now she's just had a pre-med now. Right okay. We can't find it. Can you find it for me? Okay then. Traced it. But of course it took a little bit of time, an hour or so, and th , the woman came round again, they said can't do you today can't find the joint. So, she came back out of er pre-med, had a nice happy half hour on a bit of valium and came back out of it again. Went back up to the ward cos there was no bit. Do you know where it was? In the erm gate house at the hospital. We had delivered it but they hadn't taken it from the gate house to you know, normal procedure but they, we delivered it normally but they hadn't taken it to the exact part of the hospital it was going to. So, Julie sent the patient a bunch of flowers and sh , and said sorry for the de , for the delay, you know it's there tomorrow, and she had this, she had it done again. But really, what, all they wanted to do was save face from the hospital because it wasn't our fault but she used a bit of you know, we won't embarrass the hospital we'll say And then our customer's happy. bit of customer care, but really And, well we all, we'll lose face with the patient Mm mm. because we int gonna, we haven't gotta worry about what she says about, but he sa , the hospital didn't wanna lose face, but I mean, the hospital said thank you . Cos they were saying will they tell her, you know the part hasn't come and, so we said okay, let's pretend the part didn't get there. Send her a bunch of flowers. But really it had got there but again But what I'm saying is, that service of carriage forward we were making almost as much money on the kit coming back cos we could have charged another It's five quid isn't it? Yeah. It's five pound at the moment is it? It has been up to nine or ten pound for Mm. return. Because it ca , most, we do lose a lot of money on carriage forwards. If I talk to, if you talk to our operations they will say, oh my God! Do you know why? Because, we don't know what we're carrying. A lot of carriage forwards are returns and damages. Mm. And they're in a terrible state when we pick them up. Because, you can imagine working for us, you received something and thought that's no good and can't use it, what happens to it then in your warehouse or despa Just sta , lays there. And what happens to it while it's ? Kicked around. Kicked around. Kicked about. Right. Broken. Broken and all that. And, what did you say that we get a lot of claims on carriage forward? Damaged foodstuff. You have to insure them don't you, carriage forward of course? Yeah. That's why we have to So No you don't. Yeah. Tha that means we're paying out But you see the problem is if we do actually find out. Yeah, you see the trouble is though we're so open to abuse. because Yeah. people, they don't rush back, they don't wanna urgently express back a carriage forward, they don't work. What they want is, they get on the phone and say that's no good, send me another one. And we send them the replacement, and they let the broken one sit there. How many times have you supposed to have taken something back or have it repaired or something and it's sat there, and it's sat there, and it's sat there, and it's sat there and it's collected du , I've got things round the house that I've been working on and that I've gotta, I've gotta and it's collected dust. You know, that's another project that went sort of slowly the way. Erm, and what I'm saying is, we don't address the things that aren't urgent Yeah. we only address the urgent things. But we do leave Yeah. ourselves, well we've gotta protect ourselves as carriers against other people saying ah! We broke that, or that was broke er, but we'll blame the carrier now and look at it, then our security guy goes out and they know it's been sitting around someone's you know, it's been there for months! And er, we we, we are open to abuse on them. But that doesn't mean to say that what Danny said was very valuable, and as you said Adrian, the four, the four parties, the receiver, the thirty party receiver, the people who are paying the bills buyer and us are very happy in many cases with using carriage forward in a positive way not just for returns Mm mm. yeah? The returns do get a bit dodgy I find. But we still do it cos we insure it, we, charge an extra fiver every time then it's good money. I'm stopping you through your list Phil. Well I mean, I've got a Any more? quite a few on here. Is there any ones that you want me to pin point at all or Erm le , what I wanna do is just get, just insure that we know the difference between what is giving the customer the, the benefit and the features. So we probably won't go through them all. But No. let's just discuss our way round a couple of other things because these are, this is your product knowledge now isn't it? Yeah. This is what you need to know about selling the service. It's no good, er talking about how you do something, how you do is not what they're interested in. So whats, that's how you do it. How do you do it? the customer. It's, it's what can please me. Cuddly toy . What's in it for me? The with them factor. What it is in it for me? Okay. I've got liability options. What d'ya mean by that, liability options? Well like being insu , like people have got a choice of different options of insurances and That's a good one. Now if I said, ooh! We offer good liability options. We can give you transport liability at, what level's that? Aha. Five thousand pounds, ten thousand pounds, and fifteen thousand pounds costing three, three, six, and nine pound respectively. Five, ten, and fifteen. Which is forward transit . Don't be like that. What is the free? Fifteen pounds a kilo. Sorry, five, sorry I got that one. Three, Six and nine. Six and nine. and nine. And the free one is? Fifteen pound a kilo. Right. Okay. Now what I'm saying is we, because we have good liability what can that imply? You're getting a How can you sell it's properties then? In the likely event In the likely event In the likely event Likely event so Well we won't us, it won't graduate any but does it have to do got this You're committed liability? you're committed, you're committing to your service It's like life assurance. on the fact that you can offer you your high rate of liability. Cos by offering a high rate of liability it's, it's suggests that we Concerned. that we care. And say we co , we, we're committed. Rather than see non-damaged if you like. We're limited I won't ta , I don't like using the word problems without . The reason why What about the we can afford to offer such good liability cover is the risk is very minimal. Is small, yeah. The cost is very minimal. Yeah. Mm. That's what you're saying isn't it Adrian? Yeah. Good. We can get excellent Try to find the words but you had a good, good case there. We can get excellent rates from insurance companies That's right. because we are so good. Now we , actually Yeah. we are our own I know about this. inge , we're our own which means that we are, our problems are so limited that we actually carry the liability ourselves, we don't even have to use an external company to get the rates on. We are so , so what I'm saying is, we can afford to offer marvellous cover because it's, because erm, the risk is minimal. Dixons Starsfield got er, the same as ours really, got . Who does? Who does? Dixon Starsfield, Dixons, Currys. Right. Where they, they offer extended five year warranties. Now the chance of you actually needing a Yeah. five year warranty on a T V is . That's right. They generally don't go well. My friend li , my friend offers a lifetime guarantee on his leather furniture. Lifetime. But the way It's a it's not . It's a ex , it's an extra selling point that's what It's like when when Exactly. you sell me a When you go to buy it you think oh I've got a life I can change it. you take out, I think most people take out life insurance Don't you? you don't expect to die but you just cover every That's right. eventuality. That's right. That's the pitfall. But what Yeah. what what the insurance salesman do is do wobble you a little bit so that you will take it out, you know, can you afford down, if you were forty having a heart attack leaving a wife and young child behind. I mean, they do tell you, they sell on that way don't they? Yeah. Yeah well they do To sell, sell them. they sell you som something to do with it. You say that, that is negative. Cautionary tales. Yeah. You know when somebody's at, when someone's at a lowest point, that's when they go straight in Anything for a sale. Yeah. and you get them to make a will afterwards. It's co you see salesmanship is applying psychology, you know, and a lot of people, I mean,wha the reason why insurance companies are justified is a lot of people are protected by it, you know. You don't always know what's good for you, you do need someone to say. Mm. And you're twenty one Can you explain it to me again Kath Mhm. about the options there please? Right. What is it that you are, you don't understand? Well I understand that you get fifteen, it's just that I've got a lot of customer where I got business that is depending on the kind of insurance that we give them, based on what our Yes I understand. competitors are offering. Erm, the fifty P, P a kilo up to fifteen thousand, that I Yeah. That's pro-rata. Yeah. That I understand. Fifteen pound per kilo. Oh sorry I co , sorry, fifteen pound Yeah. per kilo up to Pro-rata. Up to a thousand kilos. which is, yeah, that I That's that I understand. So, if it only weighs kilos you will get how much cover? Thirty quid. Er thirty, thirty quid. Yeah. You understand that, right? Yeah. Now But when you got to the options, now The full liability, yeah? what are you saying now fi , up to five thousand pounds? Per item, per per assignment. Right. Regardless of weight. What's that, what right You're buying a aren't you? You pay three pound extra Oh extra? Yeah. On top of your own On top of Oh that's right. on top of the fifteen pound per No. kilo? No. On top of whatever No, no. price the customer's paying. Customer's rate. How do you achieve a rate Sorry can, can anyone say if you can well I just say he doesn't pay fifteen pounds a kilo Adrian, he pays nothing. He pays the rate you ask him to pay Yeah. and, inbuilt in that rate Mr , is fifteen Oh I see. pounds coverage for every kilo of weight. That's right. So if you have a thousand kilo pallet it's fifteen thousand pounds. But if your item weighs a half a kilo, we'll round it up to the first kilo so that's any valid for fifteen pounds. Right. Now obviously that's worth a lot more than fifteen pounds to you isn't it? Right. So what I suggest you do is pay an additional three pounds which means that that is now covered for up to five thousand pounds regardless of it's weight. Right. Now I understand. Are you happy with that Adrian? Yeah. Now, the reason Yes, yes. why you give them different options right. Thank you. On, on, on the same day they only charge nine pound and i , everything's valid up, insured up to fifteen thousand pounds per consignment. Are you happy,yo you happy with that then? In actual fact, sorry to point it, that's consignment contracts . Right. But yo , So i I haven't, you know, it, because when you read it it doesn't always make, it goes in there, and I understand Right. people getting a little bit confused about that. But, that just means the levels of insurance, as a risk, ah, you know, and we've just put a rate in to, to represent the, the levels of insurance because we charge you more if we insure you for more then. Erm So if I've got a customer that's sending erm quite a lot of parcels but have got a Now parcels, have , what is the, what is the, what is the erm definition of a consignment? Cos this is regarding consignment. When is a Ah ah sorry , it's So , what I'm saying is it's solely for, it's erm i ,yo you could have six or seven parcels all picked up in one consignment if it's picked up by that carrier By one carrier. going to one address at one time. So that's one consignment. Now if say, let's So it's one consignment. keep it so to a dozen. Okay, so you got one consignment You've got a dozen items I want a dozen items Yeah. Which is made up of one consignment. One consignment. You're only covered per consignment, so the whole twelve together are only insured for fifteen Ah ah, ah! thousand. Aha. What he must do Is make sure that each individual box becomes a consignment. Ah ah. He's got to label up and pay for at a consignment rate each item. He Cos can't I understand. Can he put that on his er, consignment or note? Can he actually put a, a tick o on a box, you know when you fill in a consignment note? Yes. D'ya know when yo , d'ya know when you put one on each parcel You write a co sep separate consignment number Yeah. for every consignment. If if the customer feels that every item he's sending out Is valuable. is er is valuable, can he do, I dunno. a dozen individual consignment notes and then tick the particular box Yeah. that he wants? That would work out Yeah. then That one. because he's gonna pay Yeah. he'll be paying If that's what he wants. Yeah, that's it. If he needs five thousand pound coverage on each item On each one. He's gonna, he's gonna have to pay for it. he's got to send five, if you've got a twelve well twelve percent. Now, can I put it another way Adrian? I'm just trying to get an edge on my competitors Right. cos, I Let me put it another way then. This is only what we publish. If you know the value of the level of insurance your client wants Right. and if he wants to send them as one consignment, but now the value is twenty five thousand pounds collectively you can ring up Stubbings and as , or get your F and A to do this for you, Finance and Admin, ring up Stubbings and can you give me a special rate for these goods and ar , can you give me what I can charge them for special coverage to take it higher than our normal coverage of fifteen thousand pound? Oh I see. Now what they will wanna know is the ins and outs of everything that you're sending. How delicate it is, As most insuring company,mos most brokers or people like that. how value it is, and most insurance, yeah, that's right through a brokers. Would you have to send in a profile? Do you have to send it in? Yeah. I've never done it but I think you do have to send that in. And can I please recommend you speak to your finance and admin people and they will say, now don't expect to be saying, oh that'll be no problem, because we na , we ain't got a F and A like that, they're always to caution, you know. They're all Yeah. don't think you can do that son ! You know you'll get this thing, don't worry, say okay Cor! Now ,do we? We don't know. Been looking everywhere. I dunno. Anywhere er Who would call ? My husband Er erm, you, you couldn't, could put a call through. Can't. Er, well you could leave a message then? No. Well done Jenny. Very good. And just all the right format Yeah. of questions there. How did it feel about ringing and asking questions that were ? Did it throw you a bit did it? Yeah. I mean really you're saying I could I can't think of anywhere to go,my God! I mean , she's saying well what do you exactly mean by this question? I mean, I wasn't the world you know. Now Erm did she hesitate for some time before the answers? Yeah. Mm mm. and what did Jenny do when she hesitated? Lis listened. She did, but she did something else as well. She went ha! She went off . She went Mm. Everything. And you say ooh, come on, come on. Come on Have I said the wrong th Did you feel a bit uncomfortable when she hesitated a bit then? Mm mm. You we , and it feels like that when you're on the phone. Now all she was doing now you can see that you can read those messages about the hands went didn't they? The shoulders went, the face went long. Mm. Ooh! Er, oh! You could see her thinking about it, but you couldn't have heard that on the phone. Yeah, you do get silences like that sometimes don't you? And you get silences on the phone and you're thinking this is going down like a lead balloon. No! She's engaging brain it takes her some time to come out to the phone instruct the whole thing. Yeah? Don't worry about it,ta , the pregnant pause is to use. On a moment's thought for them to sort of. Did you feel the pressure of having to ask the questions till then, when, when they were asking you to do it to to plans? Very much so. Yes. And you will feel like that and you sit there Oh God! I've gotta do that . Yeah. Preparation, good preparation will help that. Relax, Jenny, relaxation will help that as well. Just Mm mm. breathing calmly and waiting. And, when she said anywhere was that enough information really? Do you really wanted to know where Jenny had, where Mandy had been on holiday? No. Would,wo , would you liked to have known more? I would have. Mm. Mm. Yeah? Yeah. How could you prompt her to expand on that? Er Could you give me a few examples? Well done Paul! That's, oh yeah, how did i , repeat the question,an an and emphasize on the word. Mm. Could you give me an example? Now if you say it in an ex , in a, in a do you want to give me a few examples? You're a bit Yeah. All she'll say, no I No. can't. If you say ah! Neil says you've been everywhere, what are the type of things, that you know, you can use tone and voice cos they can't see you. It's all in the voice what you put into voice. Bill had the opportunity to sit face to face with them and you catch his eye, you you used to er time to er use, use hand gestures and show things to them on, on presenters. You haven't on the phone. Can you give me a few examples? Could you expand on that a little? We what was your question Phil? Yours was a good one. Aha. Where have you been? Yeah. Th the, the fall on the, the repeatedness , the broken record that sort, when you repeatedly question. Ah! Where have you been? Oh I've been to, or you rephrase it in another way. Well done. Very good. And don't lose, just because she said I wanted to know, they didn't answer me. Stick with it. Even if it means a few phone calls. What exactly do you mean by that? Sorry, I've never worked in your industry, why is that? Yeah? And follow it up with a new question. So the experiences, although it's got nothing to do with your product, is what is gonna actually happen to you on the telephone out there. Yeah? Mandy, would you like ask Jenny a question? Yeah. Erm how long have you been driving? Two and a half years. So when did you learn to drive then? When I was seventeen. And what were your ideal car? Er a Rover . So I give you the choice of a, a Lamborghini or a Rover what would you rather have? A Rover I think then. Ah. So if I let you drive my Rover home, would you? Definitely. Yeah . And if I let you drive my Rover home, would you? She said yes to the actual question. That was more than a closed question, it was closed Oh right. would you? You said would you drive my Rover that's the question? When you said we'll talk about that question last. And the others will have to wait till they come up again. Ah ah! Right. Well done. See that, excellent. Right. How did it feel Jenny asking a load of questions? Straight out weren't they? Yeah, when she was saying asking them And the, that's right. Now, the other thing is Phil because he's got a new experience with it, struggled to find a question. Right, he knew what she was talking about, she'd got it written down and she was gonna get that information. But sometimes it can sound too I know this didn't happen Yeah, comes a bit too it's just I mean I'm not suggesting you, you behave like that on the phone but what I'm saying is, awareness now, I'm just slagging off the awareness. When it sounds rehearsed, it sounds, like, that. And it doesn't sound quite as clear as if you have to think about who you're talking to. So the fact that you struggled Phil Mm mm. to find the next question, the customer knows you're thinking. Ah that's interesting. Try and get that now buy yourself a bit of time Mm. think about that. Let me , let me think about that. Do you mind if I come back to you on that one? And if you can't stand the heat get out quick and come back to it. But it, eventually it will sta , you'll think afterwards, oh God! I didn't know the next thing. Analyse what you did Sure. then think about it, and there's always another call. Yeah? No problem at all. Okay. Now, that was very well done . No problem at all there. Paul, would you like to ask Carly a question? I didn't understand it. I've done three questions of each. Oh God Paul ! Do you understand it now? No I, no I understand what you're saying, it's just that I thought you said three questions of each. I done three open, three limited, and three yes and no questions. Would you, would you wanna erm, d'ya wanna No I've crossed them all out now. Okay. Go on. Well away you go then? Sorry, well I've The blurb. got that one. My, must be my mistake. Well I thought you would have got it in black and white. I got a big No go on. in the mornings. Go on Paul. Carry on. Carry on. Hello Carly! Hello Paul. How long were you seeing your boyfriend then before you married him? Er, about six years. About six years. Whose idea was it to get married? Both of us really. Yeah? Right. How old were you er when you got married? Twenty one. Do you live at home with your par , er your parent's home or erm do you live in, in your home? Well currently with my parents because we moved down. Are your parents ha Or moved up I should say, sorry. erm are your parents happy with your choice of husband? Initially no. Well , I was afraid of the answer then. Well done. That was a very good question Paul. Yes obviously. Excellent Keep you on . Excellent questioning Paul there. Well I did have some more but I thought no I Ah, thank God for that! . How did you feel about answering those questions? Fine. No problem? No. Again, speed But I think erm Sorry go on. Sorry. No. Answering back I thought he could have given me a bit more time cos I wanted to say something else and he was Ah ah! That's interesting. Yes. You could have got more information Paul! But I didn't. Ah I know. But I didn't But just want any more. I thought it was, it was, it was,en en en No can I just, can I say encroaching on her private business. the er yes I know. I know. I don't care. It's only an exercise and, and you Yeah. and you have e , your own agendas there, obviously. What I'm saying is is sometimes slowing the pace and simply Yeah. let her think a little longer because and then she'll say, oh! And then she's just think of that. With Phil's hesitance we got a bit more. And Phil was thinking I wonder whether this is about and I'm trying to think of the next question . No. Which is the question of what you feel when you're in the field out there trying to work something through. Which calls Actually you've hit the nail on the head there didn't you? Mm? When you said Phil thought he wasn't, I'm not listening. No. Because that's what it's all about. Yes. And when you're listening you're watching for body language as well. Mm. And so if you have not been concentrating on the question Yeah. you will probably have recognized the body that says I'm prepared to give you more. Now, to be fair that comes with experience. Of course. Listening, as you become more comfortable and you become, you've done it a few times you know what you're gonna have to say and then you, you er, you listen more carefully to the answers. But the listening is the key. Paul had it well prepared and really she sa , but sh all his answers met with a logical sequence didn't it? Mm mm. Very well done and he spent a lot of time working on that did you notice? I'm not saying that's, okay, you got a bit misled by the instructions but don't worry, but he still gave you could see that you know he was, you know, he was just Yeah. you know, he was caught in a He was concentrating . train of thought. He was erm , he was trying Thanks. very hard and e , good, good preparation does take effort. I mean I know we're only playing here, but it does take effort and, practised effort becomes easier it doesn't become hard work. It's like playing a good game of squash, squash, to get a better game and it's not so hard because you're off to, you, you're fit for the game. And that's what you'll do, you'll become fit. You'll be a better player. As you say, when you're on the phone you get those silences you just of go, mm mm, mm Well done Jenny! And like, Well erm, what's ha , what would you call those? Right. Okay. They know you're listening. Listening noises. That's very good. That's very good. Right. All Can I do, just make one announcement? Yes. Please do. Just to illustrate how important this thing is, you've probably all come across and it really irritates me, you see people interviewing people on television and they've got their clipboard there and they've obviously got a prepared question so they can't falter and fine, that means they've prepared it. And they ask a question and somebody's very open with the answer and they da , they just,sa expand on that answer and then, two or Aha. three questions later they ask them the very question they just answered E e expect and that really irritates me! And that's purely and simply because they're just not listening. Oh. The easiest thing in the world to take off that question Yeah. so that it's so think about that because Yeah. And you'll lo you don't want to get the backs up of your customers by asking them questions . That is right. And you'll losing the point of why Absolutely. you're asking the question. See Aha. you're not, you're not paid to ask questions, you're paid to get in , information. Info. Yeah? That's the point. So that fact that you can't think of a next question Phil Mhm. don't worry, you've got some information. We can all ask questions later okay? What you really want then is a way to sort of happenings or embarrassments because you're a bit stuck of where you want to go. Mm mm. That's interesting. Let me write that down. Ah! You're giving yourself some new , you know. I think one of the things Phil can do in that si Don't worry about it. or anybody could do in that situation is having asked a question, they're a bit hesitant about er, the next question then simply throw in there to buy yourself some time something like ee, is that all? Or, is any more that you can add to that? Just to give yourself a bit of time Mm. Or repeat the question. for the next question. It will help Yeah. you. Like we've just suggested. Oh have you? Or, what was your way of doing it before you said? When, when you wanted to know where Mandy went? Can you give us, tell us about that Paul? Well I kept asking her, it made hard work, yeah. Yeah. What did you do to her? You've not been listening have you Paul? You know whe when, when we asked He's still Well I thought she didn't know that. No he's still sitting back on his reflected glory now. And rightly so as well. Well done. Carly would you like to demonstrate yours Kath. now? Er Could I say, say something? Yeah. I just think I just think it's quite important for us all to realize I did a, when I used to do a similar job to this it took me a long time before I realized that the customer, you know on the phone doesn't know that your you shouldn't have asked an open question there Oh. on the close and it comes, it just comes with practise, get all Right. from practise doesn't it? Which is exactly it. what I'm saying is is, you can, it doesn't matter how you ask the question, but sometimes what I'm trying to help you practise, cos we're not, we're very good at asking closed questions in conversations but don't very often recognize, but you know, we, we we we, we'll zip backwards and forwards, and that's okay, but I want you to do consciously is know what type of questions you're asking because you can sometimes be hitting a brick wall and thinking I'm getting anywhere here and it's because you're asking too many closed questions. Mm mm. And you're making it sound like an interrogation. Erm, especially when you're in front of a screen er or you're in front of a, a form that you're, someone's saying get the traffic profile out and th what they send, what they, how many they send, it can sound like an interrogational. Get the buyer, get the product, get the carrier, get, and so on like that. You've got to be careful that you are not losing the skill of a conversation. Mm. Open question what th va , advantage of open question is, is you do a less of it and they More of it. More of it. And that's why it, on a foundation course we keep the questioning very simple. Justin's experiences has tooken it, taken it further than that which is brilliant, and he can apply those skills straight away. And if you've got those skills apply to them job, I'm not suggesting you don't, but remember the first part of a, a tele , er a telephone or a face to face sales negotiation is,th th two of these and one of these. Right? You should you be posing the questions and letting the discussion take place. Posing the questions, controlling it but posing it and letting it go. Right? And you're gaining information. When you've gathered information a , and and come to a conclusion erm interesting, we may have something for you there. And that's when you get your presenter out and start matching to what the customer wants. Now you've gone through an alternative yesterday and we know, we ta , we don't talk what is built in by design, what do we talk about? We tell them what's built in by design and then we Tell them the advantages. of what they get out of it. . And we keep it simple. One feature maybe one or two benefits and you don't have to tell them the whole story. Mm mm. As you said Bill, pull out the benefits and features that are appropriate to what you've heard. Er, there may be something you're interested in there? Now there are tighter ways of actual sales negotiations but we haven't got the time to go into it today. You'll have to come back on your selli , your course to do this. Okay? Or you ca , if you can do it on your own, brilliant! Run with it now. But what I want you to do is gather information, this is your answers, and match what you're doing er, what we sa provide with what you found out then. Okay. And you'll find out what method by just simply questioning them about the . Let me just check before we start that everybody's got this. I'm sure Danny, Jenny, and Carly have, but just because we've gone half way, can I just let the other three finish off their presentation? Cos they've sat and done the preparation. Carly. Okay. Hello Paul! Erm, I know you're allergic to food and drink, so you keep on telling me, what sort of food are you allergic to? Just about everything under the sun. What sort Dairy products erm dairy products , oranges various fruits. Remember the listening noises. Right. Mm. Yes? Er, can't think of anything else specific at the moment. But it's just about, I've got a list at home, it's about this long though. Right. Okay. Erm do you actually What type of question is that when you do actually? him. What type of question A minute. Yeah. And then, give him a choice like, can you A choice . what were you going to ask Carly? Do you actually I was gonna ask him, do you actually eat the products still to a limit? Right. Okay. It's a closed question there. Right, that's right. How can you change ask,ge get to that, but say it as an open question. If there are limits No. That's a closed question. What do they begin with? Sorry, they're the words which you were . Which foo , which food do you eat? Yeah. They're the words true. There is nothing to give me There was no last night. these are open questions. You said, do you actually eat the products that made you allergic Paul? Right? What you're saying how can ask any of those, any of those sort of questions? This is a very useful one. Just by . How can you ask but using that word at the beginning of it? I am allergic to almost an anything. And you wanted to know do you eat almost anything don't you? Yeah. Do you still suffer? So, what, what word do you make it into an open question? Can you have them? How Just How How much of this food do you eat? How much of these Yeah. do you? Mm. Which food. Does anybody have any other suggestions. Mandy, you were saying Which foods do you eat? Which food.

Going by last night apparently, ordinary roast. Yeah. Okay. Let's get back to the point, the point of the questioning. Carry on Carly. Go on then. Erm Wha are you scared erm No. Are you scared, what type of question? An open. Let her work it through for herself. Oh yeah. I know, I know that your trying to help her. But I'm trying to make her brain work not one of yours. No, I have got a . I want to borrow , I want to borrow we can borrow your brain tomorrow Mandy. We'll probably need you again Erm tomorrow. What I'm saying is, are you, what er Yeah. what does it, what are you trying ask him Carly? I dunno . What was your second, answer to your second question? Sorry. I eat lots I eat , I eat everything that I'm allergic to, virtually. I'm allergic to everything but I still eat it all. That's the information you've got so far. Right. Is there a special method of cooking your food at home, not obviously outside? Now nobody help her tables in the mill. He made a contract then out for us. And we worked on this contract for two month, to try it out for him but we were thirty pound a week less, and we had over two hundred slates a day more, on the on this contract. T we were thirty pound a week less. But nobody was prepared for it, to take it and that's how it was. What w was it about th the new tables that produced the situation? Well these tables he bought, well I hadn't seen tables like that before, he bought them in Italy somewhere. And they were sawing these slates in into blocks, you know sawing them square like into the size of the slate, they were quite handy. But the time involved to saw them was too much. The other table what we had before was better, was no much so much time involved, by the time you'd screw them round and turn 'em, to saw them into blocks there was a lot of time involved in it. Cos we're loosing a lot on 'em. But they were handy when you had them sawed, cos they were quicker for the slate, I said to er splitter they were quicker then to split 'em up. But we found we were sawing a lot of stuff up, was no good for the slate making, you know it it's got to be good for slate making, a lot of veins and lots of muck in 'em. But the tables were good then but erm too much time involved in them, in in sawing with in them. That's what I found out. W w where they w w once when they'd been installed or was it thought that it a mistake had been made in obviously a lot of cash had been spent on them but erm, was it considered a mis a waste of money or? Well it was a waste well I'll tell you what it was really, he saw a lot of waste on the other tables going on the tip you know, there was a lot of waste going over. Well these tables were doing away with a lot of waste. Getting more slates not so much waste out of them, cos these tables were sawing er them into blocks. There was no what we call, ends on on the slate, you know going over the tip, there was not so much waste with them there as the new tables. Why is it that this machine c c could trim it on all sides? Yeah we used to trim 'em with a hammer and chisel before Yeah. and there was a lot of waste, but these new tables did bring that, it was something for the company it was more than anything, you know cos we were on the bonus system. Slate we wanted to produce we want, you know if there a lot a bit of waste going over the tip, we weren't so much worried bout the waste, cos we was on the bonus we were making the slates and that. But he was worried more about the waste then then ours contract That's what he was cos there was a lot of waste on the old tables, and they make a bit more waste than on these new tables there. Ha ha ha ha how did it come about that you were on you were on one side very firmly and the employers were on the other side very firmly and sides had been had been drawn up? Well I don't think and nobody will turn this you know this he nobody would, he'd put his mind to something and there is nobody on earth that could turn him. Nobody on earth could turn him to do er to er change his mind. And behind him again there was his son-in-law, you know that only he's worse than . Then the one that runs the quarry to us, he's well he's worse only he was behind it in a way, he had he was the one with the brains, he was the one that new how to get the men to work for nothing. He was behind ee he had the brains, and was carrying it out for him, cos erm this erm I dunno if you know him eh, he runs this quarry to us up here. Oh he's terrible there, he even had them he had young girls working for him up there, and they found out they were paying he was paying them too little and then he got caught up with 'em, and erm what he done after he charged for taking them up there in the morning and charged 'em for taking them down in the evening with a Land Rover. So he had them both ways didn't he? He's a terrible man that one. Aye but he was behind the this cos they're all in the in the same boat you know, they're all families, family affair isn't it. But they say the old man didn't have anything to do with it, but I dunno, he could have had something to do with it, I dunno. I I dunno there Can you give some idea of how it came about that you in fact decided strike? When we started well we were in trouble in York When we at then we were going on the go slow system you know, we didn't produce much slate we were on the go work to rule. We let this carry that out for a month or so, and he was very annoyed about it. And then erm the lads in both they had decided they were gonna go on the go slow, but they were told if you go go on the on the go slow system, you're gonna go home, he said, I'm not prepared to carry on with that, he said, the manager there, that's brother that is. When a they were sent home from we went home from this quarry then, and the everybody went home so the the were forty of us in altogether. Everybody went home an, we were all on picket line after. Have you got any idea of w what they thought then of the fact that you were all acting, the three quarries, were acting as erm one body? Well we were all union members, and everybody wanted to be together, if you are if you are in the union well we had to stuck together an the the more we stayed together the stronger we are, to keep out if we can stay out. That's what we always thinking of ain't it. And it was last August, last August Bank Holiday this was started, just before the Bank Holiday weekend when i cos we were all on that gates, Bank Holiday weeks, stopping all the traffic going in there Yea That's how the know is, maybe if we'd a gone back then and,yo you know, if he, he offered us to go back then about September. Yeah to go back to work on this Thursday but we didn't go an all we should have gone then. And tried to get some settlement, but I don't believe it are giving us any settlement cos he wasn't prepared to do anything like that. And I know he had, you know he was stubborn, he wouldn't give in, nobody would he give in to nobody then. He was stupid, stubborn that's what he was. When you first erm when you first came out on strike. Did you have any idea how long you would be out Well everybody thought we'd be out for a week or so, but we were out for a month or er more when these scabs started going back. Well I knew then it was gonna finish off, you know. If more would have gone back then the strike would have come to an end quicker cos, I thought more would have gone back then, but all the lads in they stayed out and nobody went in to work. When the others went back to work, how did you manage to stop anyone else from going back to work? Well all th all these lads that have gone back, they were having a hell of a life in the town of course. If they went for a drink everybody was calling them scabs and if they went anywhere then, some some had their cars sprayed with paint and oh they had everything done, they were all against them. And the still now. The they were scabs then and the scabs now, and they'll always be scabs all their lives now. They will be called scabs wherever they go. Er even e even n now they are marked men yes? Yes they'd like if they were in South Wales, in South Wales you know if your grandfather was a scab, you'd be a scab wouldn't you, they carry it out in generations there. And I believe, in this it's brought a lot of thing in this town there small town like this. Cos these lads now that have gone back, and they were scabs then and they'll scabs they will be all their lives now. Everybody will be looking at them as scabs, wherever they go. No matter what they do they'll always be scabs. No, and as for and I dunno. I suppose they've shot better men than 'em Aye.. Yes Could be. I couldn't have shot any worse I don't think so I don't know what'll happen. Well I'm not worried cos I'm over sixty there, but these lads, I'm worried about these lads, that have mortgages and children to rear up they had lots of worries, and they still have. But these quarry owners they're not worried about them. They just worried about themselves Mm is it rather on the ye yo yo you said earlier on that er the old s s system of striking bargains was on a individual basis? Yes. on, on a team of or a contract of four men. So there's obviously a tradition of people of the quarry men and the quarry owners talking to each other. Yeah. Was the fact that there was no talking going on, completely surprising from the point of view of the tradition of bargaining? Yeah well in the old days, you know everybody was in the union. You couldn't work in the quarry, you couldn't go through the gate in the quarry without being a union man, in the old days there. And there was this system of four men in a bargain, nobody knew the other man's wages, we were all on different wage, everybody was on a different wage. And if you were well in with the staff and the owners of the quarry you'd have more bonus. They'd fix you up with er better bonus, but if you were a black leg they'd er be on less wagers. That's what is was it was a terrible system there, but that was the system, that was the system they carried through the quarries in all the years that are gone. It is contract it's a monthly contract you work for three weeks for one pound sixteen shillings and at the end of the month they count all the slates you've done during the month. And you get this little bonus at the end of the month, maybe a couple of quid on top of your one pound sixteen shillings. That's what they were doing, and then if you made too much slate this month, the following month they'd drop your bonus down, so as to see as to keep you on the same level, so you couldn't go any higher if you if you had good slate and worked your guts out. And the following month they drop you, that's how they used to do it Was there any sense that er you were in fact being put in the same position as your parents had been your your grandparents, had been in in in the sense not being able to get above a certain level by having your wages your bonus cut? Well they I I tell you this they they we'd worked for him for er good many years and there was no talk of any cuts in wages, we had this wages all through the through these years, and everybody was happy with it. Everybody were working on it and everybody was working a g a g a good days work and hard cos slate quarry work has always been hard anyway. But everybody was happy there, and er, till this came along, he's the one that wanted us to work for less. When he came along how could you see things had changed or how could you see in the process of changing? Well straight away the first thing he done was to put these new tables in, and that was his idea when he put these tables in to get more slate, and less wages. I dunno whether he he thought his father paid us too much, I dunno, but erm that's what he had in mind to start with, was drop the wages down thirty pound a week. For everybody. Was there any alteration in the style of management at all? No, not a thing jus we were all working, just on the same, everybody was working,fr real hard but erm. He had that in mind all the time to to cut the wages down, that's what they wanted to do. That's what he wanted to do to from the start, cut the wages down and make more slate, that's what he had in mind. He wasn't prepared to do anything else there no ar and he was he was to have these plant hire, you know these two, when when his old man used to work us us in the quarry, well this was working up there as well, he had lads working on the plant hire for him. He had about a dozen lorries on the road, and machines er working the roads there, all they were working for nothing for him, these lads and he'd come along and before Christmas he'd stop a couple of them, just before Christmas, he used to do that every year. Stop 'em, just before Christmas he used to stop 'em. And my son-in-law he was working with him, and when he had that accident, well it's ridiculous what he done that day. When he reversed that dumper over the tip. Eleven o'clock in the morning, and lost his leg. And he held the wages of the afternoon of him. No I'd r I thought that was really terrible there. Stopping a man's afternoon wages after he lost a leg. Er it was, and he was only paying him twenty two pound a week at the time. Was that considered a hard thing at the time? Very hard, very hard I told the lads I told 'em the union about it what he done that day. Must must be terrible man to do a thing like that eh. And you know is after an accident like that, well, we never, the old slate quarry company wouldn't do that, they'd pay the day off in one a serious accident like that. But that holding the afternoon off him after loosing a leg I think that was really terrible aye. When it became obvious that the strike wasn't going to last a fortnight or it wasn't going to last a month. How did you organize yourselves to stay together? Well we had a meeting every week, a a union meeting, every week. And we had the fantastic help in from South Wales, most thos terribly good er people were terribly good to us in organizing er different things. Many supported us and the present the people. Fantastic I never thought of anything like it, the money was coming in everywhere. They really did help us Aye. W w w w what sort of er p p people or organize or organizations where helping you then? Well union, you know the union in the coal mines and all different well er everywhere in the North Wales here to, postmen, well every union was helping us with them. Organizations and er money coming in everywhere and food parcels. They were helping everybody. I never thought of anything like that, I couldn't believe it. Really fantastic, and there's still money in the fund now, for after it. There was money coming in from overseas, Germany, Belgium, Holland, there wa everywhere helping us. Aye. W w w w were you as erm a large were you organized in any way in ord d er to c con t t t =tinue the strike le le length of time? Well we could a continued it for erm, well I dunno, but erm it was getting a bit out of hand with the picket line really, cos there was a lot of these youngsters who weren't prepared to do these picket line. You know they were coming there this week and they wouldn't come there for three or four weeks or something, thinking with this picket but it was very important to keep that gate, stop everybody from going in there. But there was a lo lots of these youngsters who wouldn't prepared to do this picket business. As they they got fed up with it I suppose I dunno er. But there was no point in carrying it on really you know it. If we'd a carried it on for say this time of the year now you with this erm Whitsun Holiday now, we'd have had to to do it seven days a week, cos you'd have to be there Saturday and Sunday to stop anything going in there . But they weren't prepared to do it were they. You know these youngsters they weren't prepared to stay on that gate. W w w was the the encouragement then for the picket from the older men? Well we c couldn't we had a lot of arguments about it you know in the union meetings about this picket line. But we couldn't make anybody do it, you know they'd say, anyway that we'll do it, there's there's next week they wouldn't catch you up some of them. So er er well we couldn't carry it out, cos the the ones who weren't prepared to do the picket wasn't erm going to do it, we'd have to do more of 'em to keep these youngsters on doing the picket, you know. Where they then a group of people who, to whom the burden of being on p p per picket falling more and more? Yes that's how that's how it was,yes all I was on that gate, I'd been on that gate myself dozens of times. On my own there I I wasn't worried about it er you know. But if one i man does the picket and the others don't, well it's gonna not gonna go show are they. That's what the company wanted us you know to break up on it. They wanted us, if everybody would have gone with me too the picket. That's what these slate quarry owners wanted us for us to fall back. The strike would have fall apart then. That's how it was It had fallen apart with er without. Everybody was standing, they was gonna go out. That's why all these collieries have a different in it. You know these self worth they're so terrible keen aren't they. When you began to make all sort of when c contacts began to be made between erm you and South Wales in terms of support Yeah. D did you get any sort of erm, apart from financial support and material support, did you get any moral support of how a strike should be con conducted? Oh yes they were they were telling us not to pack up there that keep the g gate going and you know they were, keep it going and they they'd er help us. For years to come because if they stay out they give us hundred percent help to carry on with it. But erm I dunno there's some of them weren't prepared to carry on with it, you know these youngsters, there was a lot of 'em they wouldn't, anyway everybody's not hundred percent you're not going to get anywhere with anything. You f emphasized the fact of erm s solidarity fr fr from want of a better word. Yeah. Erm was it in your opinion because the young men had a lot of financial pressures that they they weren't as s solid as the older men let's say or was it because they hadn't No they hadn't a no they they started alright on that picket but as time rolled on and they was getting erm fed up with it, you know they that's how it went as they were getting, oh I we won't go up there today, bugger it. And that's how it happened and you know some weren't prepared to s stay there on the gate an watch that nobody don't go in it er. When you were in, when you were discussing these things in the l lodge meeting erm d d d did the younger men sort of indicate how they felt towards the picket? Oh aye, know these youngsters today, they not er not the same as when we were young I don't think. They don't seem to worry about anything a lot of these youngsters today. You know if you're out on strike you're out on strike and must make it hundred percent, that's how it is. Cos if you do anything you doing you must do it, go at it the right way and stick to it, ain't it. But a lot of these youngsters er you know. There was a few in the lads they were just didn't want to do this picket line. And they were letting the burden on the others weren't they, to do it. And there was lots of the we came to an end and if we were going to carry on with this further we the everybody was getting a bit fed up with it. We were all getting fed up with it cos, having to stay on the gate five hours a day you know, three or four times a week. Was really poor there but I dunno if we'd er stayed there or and carried on with it. Was the er erm attention of the press, the television, the radio, the support of the local M. P., er m ministers in the town, university students, and all the other organizations, was that in in any way a help? Oh yes, it was a help the students give us a fantastic help you know, in financially and the the came on that gate a lots of times with us. They were on that gate with us very often, in the mornings and that. And er the M. P. on this he was up there with us, he was hundred percent too with us. Oh yes, we had fantastic support out of them aye fantastic. Everybody was p hundred percent, everybody. But it was the scabs er that well they put us down to start with, and then the was picket line started cracking up was the these lads not prepared to do it. That how it went out of hand in the end in it. And everybody was getting a bit bored with it cos as it dragged on this is s seven months when you know a long time to be I never thought it would have gone this as long as that when we started off with it. Where you erm aware at all that people were were having serious financial problems? There's quite a few there with had fantastic trouble with their finances you know. Cos the mortgages and that but there's a lot of them, and kids causing it, and Christmas was coming well you know we just, that's when they helped us at Christmas was really fantastic yes, true I never thought anything really out of this world how the how the people helped We got toys and everything for the kids' Christmas, everything you could think of. Nobody or kids were short of a thing, cos erm people from everywhere were sending things. And everybody had a t a twelve pound turkey each. Aye everything was gi really fantastic the people that helped the people that gave to the strike, out of this world I know the help they had was really fantastic. You e mentioned earlier on that people received er food parcels? Yes. Ha ha ha how was this organized? Well the erm the girls were doing all the the wives were doing all the food parcels every week. They were going up to the we call it. And they were organizing food parcels for every striker. And delivering them around on a Friday night and Saturday morning. And it's a really good parcel,th they thought of everything they had everything in the in the food parcel, very good. What sort of things would Oh. you you know sort of had erm eggs, butter, tea, everything you could you needed was in there, and tins of all different kind of soup and were apples, oranges, everything was in there, in the parcel. Really good parcel every week they were having. Would We have received apologies for absence from, er from er Mr . Are there any other apologies which we've received. Thank you. The minutes of the meeting held on the twentieth of October have been er distributed. There is one modification er which has been drawn to our attention that is Mr Ian was present on that day. Subject to that er amendment is it your wish that I should sign those minutes as a true record of that meeting? agreed thank you Er public petitions, none have been received, er other business, none has been notified. Questions none has been received. We therefore move to item one on the agenda which is the local management of primary and secondary schools and I call upon Mr Christopher to introduce the report. Thank you Chairman. The home manual school panel meeting erm on erm for sometime now and I think for those people who don't get to see the government. It is an illustration of how it can, and should be done. Because once the vigorous discussion, rarely does anyone sit and accuse us of having had clearly party political discussions, we had a job of work to do and as a result of that job of work is in front of you now in items one and two. Item one deals with further delegations and aspects of further delegations er to primary and secondary schools. The officers on part of the panel have consulted schools very carefully about the last remnants of possible delegation which might arise and the recommendations are as presented to us in red, set out in section three. Section three point one gives aspects of further delegation which the panel considers after consultation with schools should not be proceeded with in nineteen ninety four, ninety five and justification for that is in the papers which is attached to agenda item one. It should be realised of course that this does not close the door on further delegation each year should indeed there be indication from the schools that they would so wish. Section three point two deals with funding for non pupils with special educational needs. We suggest that this present system which I think many of us have doubts about should continue for practical reasons for nineteen ninety four, ninety five only and for ninety five, ninety six, we will have the benefit of the audit. Three point three has been rather involved er aspects of examining average teachers' salary costs basically will fall down given that we've had a sixty five percent return from schools and we will be able to use this year, coming year the actual mandatory points in determining how delegation of salaries should be proceeded with. Three point four is a small matter, of deputy head whilst it would be inappropriate of course to er schools indefinitely should there be reduction in numbers, certainly we do need a mechanism by which small reductions in numbers don't lead to a tragic and drastic loss of staff. Section three point five is banking needs that er there was quite a lot of current by arrangements, but opt outs use erm, that's an unfortunate word in terms of education and will be allowed for those who are wishing to have alternative arrangements. The panel is still considering the divisional schools library service erm the, they're very clear is at to whether these costs to the library is a fixed cost or a variable cost or perhaps even more to the point that it will need to reach the cost of libraries are fixed and variable and the differing views both within the panel and schools about that and the panel is continuing deliberating research. On that basis I have pleasure in moving the in section six of this report as shown on page five. Thank you. Is there a seconder on that motion? Well further . I further question the policy erm which, erm just mentioned, the average salary issue is that we want, erm that's, that's gonna cost us a million pounds next year, but we are doing it, so there's a million pounds in growth in everybody's er budget and basically everybody's budget when we come to later. Erm on school libraries we're thinking of maintaining school library service and be as, be as fair as possible for schools that are different sizes, that I have erm, that I have erm, erm doing that. . Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. Thank you. We move then to item two the management of the schools, nursery and special schools erm this is er mostly by . Thank you. Erm the speed with which we dealt with item one is encouraging or rather it's somebody might be but item two again maybe if proposals which perhaps er a little controversy. There are two separate issues involved here, first of all there is the issue of nursery education, we have no statutory obligation er to devise scheme for the delegation of nursery schools. Nevertheless failure to do so would cause them problems. First of all nursery schools would be dealing with the County Council on a different basis from the vast of, of the schools population and that will give rise to anomalies and complications which would be undesirous and secondly there might be problems particularly if they are considering expanding nursery provision between nursery schools and nursery classes in primary schools. Both of these can be avoided by delegating nursery schools on a similar basis to the delegation which was made for ordinary schools and again you consulted about that and the proposal laid in this report. And as for all special schools there is an obligation to provide a scheme for local management of special schools with effect from April this year er we consulted there was a little bit of chasing which had to take place in which you can see in section four of the report but following that chasing, we now ascertain meeting schools on favourable proposals for or against and once a week that, a view of and also undertaking as you know. On that basis I will propose happily to suggest that those in, in Section Six of this report. and I second agenda and erm we ask for your attention to para three point four er which is the financial part of this budget really and it says that some contingencies in nursery schools should be increased, erm that it is actually allowed for in the later budget erm the tax payer budget will be . Er Mr . Yes Chairman erm, I'm, I should like to draw attention to the paragraph three, two and wonder what happened to three, three, because er we see it goes from my copy goes from three, two, to three, four, so er I don't know whether there is anything in three, three that I have forgotten, but I, I assume now that I which they're are two other . Erm may in fact find in reading the application of formula rather difficult to cope with because they're very special circumstances and of course the small nursery schools. . erm if there's, if there's a query then indeed I, I, three, three might be one of them. . . . The effective speech. . is there an added speech in what you are referring? Sorry, yes I, I, I, I'm a very, I'm two, appendix B appendix B B er C er, but there isn't three, three erm, other than clairify the erm, all solutions were made available to members of the panel as an appendix to the reports to the Policy Panel er, but that they won't to all members efficiency but were made available that's not the point. there appears to be a in as much as there is a, a section, there is appendix B as the three, two, O, three, three . typographical error, next business . I am assured that it is just a typographical error They would say that wouldn't they. . We are after all teaching these children to count which children? money that motion has been added to. Agreed. Thank you very much. It seems that you all want to hurry on to item three A, erm as far as the timetable is concerned . erm is going to make certain clarifications which we'll start with and is going to introduce the report and then to give some explanations. After that we shall move to the three motions and there will be one debate on all three motions. Chairman er, I have a petition that I have been asked to present er at what point do you wish me to do that? I suggest that, that is er brought maybe before the motions immediately before the motions are put, erm after the motions, after the debate as one debate I am proposing not later than twelve forty five to call for the winding up erm speeches by the three movers of the motions and to take the votes erm prior to lunch. If necessary lunch will constitute an adjournment. Thank you er may I then ask if would er give clarifications on certain items. Thank you Mr Chairman, I just want to cover three areas. The first one has already been mentioned and relates to the actual average salary. The second one is in relation to the sheet in front of you headed school meals and third area erm is the typographical errors on some resolutions to, to take you through . As far as the actual average salary is concerned if you look at page nineteen paragraph K a white page on your report, page nineteen, paragraph K and there you will see that you're promised an audit report on the position relating to teachers' salaries, I can confirm that the position is consistent with the remarks that, that were made earlier on, cos you have within the budget here sufficient money to provide for our current estimate of next year's actual earning salary in these schools . . We have returns so far from sixty five per cent of the schools and we expect to have the remaining schools before the end of the month, I wouldn't expect it to change from where we are at the moment but if there was a significant variation then I will be in a position to report back to the Policy Committee at the end of the month but I'm, I'm not expecting that need be the case. The second area relates to erm school meals and you have in front of you an erratum sheet the sheet outlines two areas of er change relative to erm in the main report. Firstly, I am reporting to you that there has been in the current year additional efficiency savings over and above those that previously anticipated er at the level of two hundred thousand pounds and so we are assuming in the budget erm that those can continue into ninety four, five and thereafter, and then we'll see the resolutions have been amended to take that into account and the text of the erratum sheet explains how that's been done. Appendix ten which is attached to the erratum sheet, it's the seventh page, you'll see there that you've got in front of you all the figures that were really erm concerned with in favour of the and amend er the report on lines fifty four A and fifty four B showing two hundred thousand pounds savings on school meals and you will see that reflected in the columns headed Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats and those are consistent with the resolution papers that are in front of you. Another aspect of this change is the erm the change in line fifty eight, where the business and saving in the current year carried forward has been increased to seven, nine, one, from five, nine, one, you can see in the report and you will see that operated in the new appendix ten. The second aspect of the school meals changes are with that alternative meal saving and would best be introduced erm if members were to decide that this is the way we wanted to go from April ninety five rather than in Sept September ninety four as suggested and attached to the report and that delays the savings, but achieves the same saving but not until nineteen ninety six seven and you will see that the figures have been amended and to take that into account and that's on line fifty four B appendix ten. The third area I need to take you through is some erm typographical amendments to the resolutions that you have in front of you, so if you just bear with me I proposed to go through those and perhaps if you want to mark them on the sheets as I go through and if I'm going too fast erm just wave. The first erm resolution sheet that you have in front of you is a pink one erm so the Labour group there are no typographical errors on the pink sheet. . . . . I have to say these, these are documents in terms of the addition. Erm the next erm feature is the yellow one for the Liberal Democrats, there's one Liberal Democrat typographical error and that's on the second page page four of the resolutions and you'll see that in the second column there's a total three, three, three five, that should be amended to, sorry three, three, three five that should be amended to three, one, five, five and then where it says nine the resource budget immediately below that nine, four, five, ninety four five O, it's three hundred and sixty thousand, three hundred and sixty million, six hundred thousand, that stays the same. The figure that is three, six, one, nine, two O should be changed to three, six, one, seven, four O. Yes. is everybody with me on that one? . . Again the appendix ten figures reflect the, the actual position, all we're doing is amending the resolutions and turn to the blue sheets There are dozens. And the first typo typographical error on the blue sheets is erm item six F. The first figure for section eleven should be three, three eight rather than three, three four and the two totals at the bottom of paragraph six should read three, one, O, eight and two, nine, three, zero. They're academic anyway turn over the page to page six paragraph eight, item D eight D strategy, the figure's is a hundred and six and it should be one, five, six God. and the total should be one, three, three, six in that column . crap. and that's it thank you very much . . Thank you, er Paul, erm I'm now ask er to introduce , County Chairman, I'm pleased to present to the committee the report of the head of finance and myself on each resource budget in nineteen ninety four I think I should start by stressing the process through which we have gone in order to prepare this report has been somewhat different this year from that which we followed in the past and . on, on past experience. . There has been more expensive consultation with head teachers and the governors than has been possible er before and I hope the result of that it is reflected in the pages that you have in front of you. I am grateful both to the Education spokespersons who put a great deal of time in, in order to carry out erm their preparations towards this report and to and to take part in the consultation exercises and to my own colleagues. Erm the fruits of that work will be revealed in the decisions that are made er later on today. I am not intending to go through the report in detail erm but I hope that I we will now need to draw attention to one or two issues erm which are of particular concern and which emerged through the consultation process. First of all the issue of increasing pupil numbers. I am sure that we are all delighted that numbers in schools are now rising because it can be a very difficult situation in which to work when er a head teacher and governing body find themselves trying to manage a continuous decline. At the same time that does create pressures upon the school and in particular it creates pressures upon you in terms of finding the money in order to ensure that those pupils are resourced adequately. You have, therefore, erm a proposal for a figure of over five million pounds to meet the demands of increased pupil numbers er next year and of course that will be a continuing pressure for the future. Secondly, I know that this committee has over a time been concerned about the resource needs of primary schools. We've all been aware of the extent to which the local management formula er has made clear erm the rather er significant difference between the resourcing of pupils in their families primary education and their early years of secondary education. . I hope you it will give particular attention to that issue er in your del deliberations later this morning. Nursery education is an issue which is being drawn to your attention I know over again a number of er months and years. Hertfordshire's position on nursery education is a good one, by comparison with very many other local authorities including many counties. It is an area to which the County Council has given priority in the past. That does not change the fact that as far as parents are concerned if there is no nursery school or nursery class available to them then for them there is no provision at all and I know that you will want to address the question of whether you can find additional resources for nursery education er in the course of the debate. I would also I think put in a word for the work of the joint po policy panel erm which is shared between this committee and the social services committee because it seems to me that it is not for us to be thinking that there is a group of children for who nursery education is necessary er or desirable and a different group of children for whom something else erm is necessary and desirable, largely because of their parents' position. We do have to look at all our pre-school children as a group who have similar means as they grow and they learn and they develop and I hope that we can continue to push for a co-ordinated approach to the whole range of services that we are o offering to that group of children and to their families. Thirdly, special educational needs has been an issue for this committee in the past and will no doubt continue to be an issue in the future. We are continuing to experience a significant er pressure from schools in terms of requests for form assessment and statementing of children with special educational needs. In the current term we are receiving requests at the rate of something like twenty five per week and of course that has the implications both in terms . of handling them through the, through the assessment and statementing process and it has implications in terms of finding the resources to support those children once the statements of provision are, are drawn up. You will not, therefore, be surprised to see a number of items in er the budget report which relates to special needs issues. It is an attempt to ask you to consider to maintain the sort of progress that we have been making erm in past years, but it's a problem is not going to go away. At the present time it is being compounded of course by the er effects of nineteen ninety three Education Act with all that that Act implies or tightening up er many of the processes and procedures that we follow in dealing with special educational needs, we have a host of new draft documents for consultation from the Department for Education. Many of them received just over Christmas and parents and schools are looking to us to give them help er in providing for what is a very rapidly moving situation. Section eleven, Grant you have discussed with this Committee on a number of occasions. I know that the concern is shared right across the Committee about the implications of the reductions which the government is proposing in Section eleven, grant. I think I told you some months ago that I would be asking you to consider that . in the course of your budget debate and er true to form I've brought it in front of you this morning. The need to prepare schools and help to help schools prepare themselves for the erm review of the national curriculum the changes that they will have to deal with and in particular I think, erm to help secondary schools to come to terms with changes in key stage four and the likely erm opportunities there will be for a more diverse curriculum including eventually er the opportunities for more vocational programmes in schools and to assist schools . to build on their own interest and commitment to erm deliver improved pupil attainments at sixteen and, and at eighteen, nineteen, in response the national education and training targets is an area which should not be forgotten. A number of these things that I have already raised this morning are perhaps are, er primary phase issues rather than secondary but we must remember that the pressures on secondary schools continue as in the primary phase and finally another concern which you are all very well aware of and which particularly if you're governors you will have drawn to your attention constantly is erm the continuing concern about our educational building stock both in terms of its adequacy as regards the size and the capacity of the accommodation at, where some schools are concerned its need for repair and maintenance work and its need for adaptation to meet the new demands of the curriculum. Er you have er a substantial er appendix within your er agenda papers which set out proposals from the building's policy panel which would help you to deal with some of those issues. I shall be very brief and simply mention that a number of the savings erm and the increased income that is available to, to avoid savings are the result of your own policies developed over a number of years and I hope implemented with a degree of further manage managerial action which has actually given you some money to spend, erm which will avoid you having to make er painful cuts in order to fund a new growth and in particular I would highlight the significant movement that has has now taken place, children from special educational needs provision outside the county, back into the county. Erm th the reduction in the cost of discretionary awards which is partly the result of the policies that are partly also changing the, in the national situation and increased recruitment funding and in an area into which officers put in a great deal of time to try to make sure that we do the equivalent they should be getting. It is a relief I suppose today, that I am able to speak to you on the basis erm of financial output which is a good deal more favourable than we expected even six months ago. Indeed I think we frightened some schools six months ago erm not by any means er wi malice aforethought if er, because we all thought that the financial situation might be very much worse than it is. Even so, the range of . pressures that this Committee faces and the need to try to balance out the sufficience of needs across a wide range of interest groups and a wide range of, of er pupils and schools means that your decisions are never easy. You need also a course to be provident for the future in terms of ensuring that you will be able to continue to discharge your responsibilities in years to come. It won't be easy erm but the decisions are now for you to make. Thank you Chairman. Thank you er . Erm the John is now are going to explain certain aspects of the er . Thank you Chairman. I just want to draw attention to three major components within the committee report. Erm the first is the base resource budget which is set out on page four, table one. The base resource budget started . with the ninety three, four budget, of three hundred and forty two and a half million and er through the addition of certain growth items most notably that requires the demography for the additional pupil numbers we establish a base resource budget there of three hundred and fifty nine and a half million. A seven million growth over the current ninety three four budget. The second area of the report which I would want to draw your attention to is that area concerned with growth and savings and a number have put forward in sections seven, eight, nine and ten of the report, that on pages six, seven and eight and it's got within those growth and savings that we can work to the target set by the policy committee. The high target of three hundred and sixty two point two million and the low target of three sixty point six million. Then thirdly, I would like to draw your attention to the report of the capital programme er policy programme . where they're putting forward a recommendation for a number of minor and major building projects within the capital guidelines and those are set out in appendix er appendices five and six. Finally, attached to your report er there's appendix ten which is the A three sheets the first sheet has not been changed and the first sheet shows the base resource budget which you are being asked to recommend on line twenty one and then it shows a number of savings which can be achieved through efficiency and volume changes. If those are then accepted, you have a second sheet to appendix ten which has been er modified and which has been circulated just prior to the meeting. That sets out the growth of the savings and which it contains in the report with paragraph and appendix reference numbers on them and it sets out for each of the groups, their proposed budgets. It is from that sheet that the figures were transcribed on to the erm on to the pink and the, the, the, the, erm blue and the yellow sheets which have been circulated and which have been amended so that the figures now correspond on both sheets. . Thank you. Next I was going to ask before erm are there any questions of fact, I don't want anybody anticipating the debate but are the any questions on fact. Mr Martin . Erm er Chairman, may I ask a question on paragraph four, four and appendix three, that's on page four and appendix three on the increased percentage on school milk charge? I see that percentage is quite high, way above the in the in the inflation figure er at seven point five per, er percent and I wonder if I could have an explanation for the reason for that very high increase. The er percentage is identified at the top of appendix three, annexe one of appendix three . Er let me come back on that issue the er right, well the E E C have cut their grants of all school milk I think you'll find certainly on that being discovered I would imagine that it's similar to the County Council. Thank you. May I ask er, er Mr that it would, whether she would now er pass forward the petition. Erm I gather you wish to just present the petition Yes. at this stage but you wish to speak during the debate Tha that is right Chairman,I I have a petition from the Watford Indian association containing seventy five signatures. Er it is about the future provision of section eleven which appears in the main report, you will no doubt appear as part of the budget debate. I think you can see if you look at the er, er around the chamber at the amount of interest that this er has aroused and the, the header referred to the number of other petitions and er, er letters that have been received. Therefore this time, I will just hand it to you Chairman and er, er reserve my rights to . Thank you very much. Thank you. I acknowledge this er receipt of this petition and I'm glad to see the er, er support of the present will change. . Er I understand that er Mr is now ready to respond to the questions. Yes, well erm it it isn't the effect of the changing er E C grant that's elsewhere in the budget and legislative changes item with the increasing cost there er, if you can change the grant or for instance where we're getting less grant from the E C. What it is, is reflecting the intervention crisis of milk oh, oh the cost of milk undoubtedly . going up . it is increasing the price in line the increase in cost of milk So just that, further clarification if I may, we are passing the increase er cost of milk on in the charge that we're making? yes. Thank you. Right now to read er we first call upon Labour er Bob to move the motion standing at the erm . give them some wellie but I don't think I'll do that, erm . . sorry, erm this budget has a very long gestation period er I'm on version twelve I think at the last count and I hope there isn't gonna be a version thirteen. Erm I ought to thank everybody erm, officers, members, head groups, service groups, unionists,petitions and all who've written to us. We've taken all this into account, erm I'm not sure all groups have tried to do that, erm but we have tried to please everyone, we do have some particular priorities and we do want to make significant improvements in service where we can and not necessarily looking for cheap publicity by increasing in lots of places as some people are supposed to of done so where one concludes sometime a significant amount of money in but will have a noticeable difference to their essential service. I am going to go through the pink sheet, I think that's easiest if I do that erm on the top of your pile first the base budget,an this and return to give increase the expenditure is the five million pounds or so needed for the increased number of pupils. Now we're meeting that in full and I'm glad to see that all three fiscal groups er proposing to meet that in full. Of course last year that didn't happen and last year hidden away in the first part of the er the budget papers was this cut in the amount of money going to each pupil erm in education in secondary school, so this year we are not doing that we're going to meet the full cost of so in that sense the formula will be unchanged, and of course there's growth er later in the budget and both primary and secondary schools in terms delegated budgets. We've have already mentioned the million pounds extra for salaries. There's another cost of a million pounds which results from a change in government policy of the cost of government policy, now this is including the er unfair funding of G M schools and including the loss of that was just, just mentioned. Now another of those things will be increased service, that's stand still, that's the best way to stand still. There are other elements later which, which imp improve the coordinated pension for each pupil. Erm well that base budget is rather higher than we are expecting and the time when, the policy committee set its targets for each of the service committees. It's about eighty million pounds higher than we were expecting it. So whereas the policy committee were allowing us three point five million grant maximum, on top of the er base budget, now course that's reduced because with cash limited to the total on to the base plus, so getting a lot less than with the group so they might say increase to about two and a half million rather than the figure we had earlier. So in net terms we can have maximum, we won't go to this in the current till next year, erm two and a half million pounds of growth. That's roughly about the same hours as the government's just decided to spend on sending the Parent's Charter to every household in Britain, I think that's gonna cost over two million as well. Erm the government's there are telling parents what they ought to do. This hypocritical exhortation er which is government policy these days erm is costing them same amount of money, they're actually spending intending, increasing erm education division. I use the phrase hypocritical exhortation, because I know Jim is sitting there with a tape recorder and taking note of all the words we are using today our dictionary so I think the phrase hypocritical exhortation I said three times in relation to . in relation to the Conservative party's current policy back to basics and all that I think is the appropriate expression to bear in mind. Erm, okay let me was in if you left the tape open what would happen to the gas? It would just escape so we sh close the top and the gas has got to . Down the tube and into Yeah down the other tube and into the what's the thingumajiggy? What do you call it that tall cylinder thing? Thingumajiggy? You'll never guess it's for collecting gases so we call it a Gas . Gas jar. Not far off. Oh. Now come on. Speed it u yeah cos the black powder wasn't powerful enough. Can anybody tell me why the black powder's not powerful enough. Look at the shorthand for it M N O two it's not got so much? Oxygen. Very good it's not got so much oxygen. So you've got to give it some heat to help the oxygen to work. Now if anybody's finished and is wondering what to do check through and make sure everything is up to date. And then I've got some work here for those who thing everything's up to date. So don't start this work until everything else is up to date. It's on the end of this . And if anybody's been away and has got or has got missing sheets I've got spare sheets down here. Question sheets Don't forget your acid posters by the way. Or you getting another one. It's Right I would. The only problem is I haven't got many colours. You'd you'd do better to use your own colours if you've got . How are you doing okay Dean? Oh right well you need Oh not again. Right who can tell yes go on Michael. To let the acid in. To let not out to let what in slowly. The acid in slowly right. It lets the acid in slowly and once the acids in what does it stop next? Carbon dioxide So whatever's in there can't get out up there it's got to go through another pipe it's got to go through the other pipe. Two two reasons. To stop the gas from escaping and to let the acid in bit by bit. Sir? Yeah. Er you could put P H or universal or any antacid indicator. Sir Properties who can tell me a property of this gas. Look at it in through the in the fume cupboard I can see one from here. Green. It's green right good. It it's a bit misty alright fair enough that's a property. Anything else? If it can fall down out of that pipe into the jar it must be? Very good be heavy. If it erm sucks the water up if you're not careful it must. How can it suck the water up by? It hasn't actually done cos I put that funnel on the end to stop it from doing it. Yeah it would cause a vacuum as it dissolves. So it dissolves obviously. Have you got the smell one have you put the smell smell one down. Smells of? Swimming baths or bleach or You can put some universal indicator or erm P H paper or To stop it from sucking because it dissolves too well It's like you in there drinking drinking er coke out of a straw if you you suck enough It'll all end up in your mouth. If you just put a pipe straight in the end of the liquid it would suck the liquid up. Right Darren if you've finished the qu To s stop from sucking up Now who's finished? Number three you could on the filter paper I've out some of those P H test papers. You could put universal, P H, litmus anything. Oh yeah probably we don't stop just cos you're not . Are there any I've got the index out here if you want one. I'll thank 'em all very much then. Oh fine you want to thank them now. Can I thank you all very much for being cooperative. Come in. Good morning. Hello Doctor. Now stranger, what can we do for you this morning? a long time. A number of years. Aye, it's a long number of years. You've got spots . Mhm . I was told it was chicken pox, but I haven't Mhm. been to a doctor. Aye. I've had this for over a fortnight. Did it just come on all of a sudden? I think what happened it started on my legs, here. Right? Oh deary me . Now for a while, before I went to, I went to . That's turned into . Right. It's okay. we'll get that cleared for you. I thought it was Yeah. like that. No. Four or five days and it should all be starting to I hope it's not turning . A germ, there's a germ that floats about in the air and if it gets onto the skin when it's broken. It Was it? Was it originally . Well it looks as though it could well have been originally chicken pox? like chicken pox. Yeah. But that's all it takes, it's just the skin to get broken, and underneath the skin and it just spreads and it's And you haven't seen my arms. Same. Alright. Okay. My arms are really bad. Let's get that sorted for you. it was chicken pox and I'm saying to myself it's very infectious. What about , is that infectious? Yes. That's contagious as well. And the funny thing was I've Mm. only been off my work for about er seven days. I was at my work for a couple of days, Mhm. when this started. Yeah. So I must have passed it on . Aye. Impetigo isn't nearly as easy to pass on as chicken pox. In fact it's, it's really You have to be living in the same house as somebody who's I was ask asking myself . Aye. You, you've got to be using that same towels, you know, that sort of thing. Aha. You know, actually,mo all more or less direct contact Aha. before you can pick it up. Mhm. So there's no terrible worry in that way, that you've passed on to anybody. And that, I wouldn't worry about that. get that thing? Ah, you could get it anywhere, I mean even, see the likes of that, that wee cut in the back of my hand? Aha. Well it could start off in that. Just just . See I always wondered because er it seemed awfully slow in spreading it, it was there that's right. and a couple of days with nothing happening I'm saying, well, at least it's started clearing up, but then And then it moved somewhere else. it moved somewhere else and I'm saying I'm looking at it That's right. the only place I've not got it is my abdomen and my chest. Right down the front. It had nowhere to go. Aye. And it started on my back quite a bit, three of four days ago, well it's not just as bad but my arms are real bad. Right. Let's see if we can get you turned into a human being. Oh dear, and I'm saying to myself it was chicken pox Aye, but I don't think I've heard of that impetigo Doctor to be honest. Yeah. it's years and . It used to be quite a common thing. Yes. Correct. Aye, I remember. Ah, but it's y you still see it, I mean we still see it about once or twice every week. Mhm. But I mean it used to be every day Aye. we used to see it. So, it all cleared up okay? It won't Yes. Och aye. leave a lot of marks? No? Well, I suppose it . hopefully not. No. No. No. Now not nowadays, not with the, not with the stuff we get nowadays. Now. Now. Now. And what I've noticed is I've seen my bed linen. It's been weeping at night when I'm sleeping. That's right. That's right. In your sleep. That's right. most of this is drying up but the skull must get It seems to Right. weep. That's right. When the skin when we ju move around in the bed, the skin cracks open Oh that's it, it's all cracking here. Aye. Mhm.

Right. Thank you. Okay. Cheerio now. Cheerio. Feeling blue? What do you do? One hundred women have an idea or two. Talking about depression is not something we do much, which is odd really because everybody gets depressed and vast numbers of us need help from time to time. Though because perhaps we feel guilty or embarrassed about the whole area of mental health we're not tackling the problems when they come up nearly as well we might. So we're going to try and start to change all that now. Let me ask the one hundred women here, have you ever been depressed? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And perhaps the only surprising thing about that result is that, is that seven people have said no! Ninety three have said yes. Let me ask you whether you would regard yourself a depressive person? Would you say are depressive rather than simply get depressed? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And there, only sixteen say they're depressive er people, eighty four no but the great majority here have been depressed from time to time. About what? I mean th a great variety of things are depressing but can you identify what makes you depressed? Lack of money. Sorry? Lack of money. Lack of money. And that's something, that must be a very Aha. common one? Aha. And then that your, your household is well, the sort of er, someone's lost their job, you know, you start what are we're gonna do? You know, how are we gonna manage? Mm. Etcetera. Who else? Ya? After a baby. Baby blues. Baby blues. Did you have baby blues? Yes. After my last one. Just after one? After the last one. What's it like? Absolutely terrible! Horrendous! What did you I , well I just didn't realize it was anything like that, I had I've had four children and the last one there was thirteen years difference between them and it was really, really terrible! He was about six months old and I didn't know what was wrong with me. How long did it last? About three months before I finally, I was husband made me go to the doctor or go to the doctors for me and that's when I realized it was depression I didn't know anything about it then. Really? Had you not been warned? Had you not No. read anything? No. Yes? Sometimes you don't need anything to make Mhm. you depressed. Mhm. Sometimes you've got a depressive illness. You know, a manic depressive or a schizophrenic or whatever. Yeah. Beside you. Living with somebody depressive has made me depressed on frequent occasions and th th the feelings of helplessness that you have in dealing with the person's depression. Yeah? Erm, one of the things that depresses me, is probably the main thing that depresses me is not being valued for what I am or what I do and I think many women suffer from depression because their strengths and their creativity are not recognised and valued. Mm. Anna? Being a single parent. Is that depressing? Yeah cos there's, on your own all the time and you feel you've got no time for yourself and that can be fairly bad at times. Yeah. Er, it's not just single parents, I think er, married couples as well cos I think Yep. society expects everybody to cope well and they don't. So I think that can become quite depressive as well. Up there. I think from what everyone's saying being a woman in Scotland today is that in itself er, a cause for depression. I think trying to exist in society at the moment is extremely difficult. And there's wi wide er, spread unemployment and there's the stress of being as that lady said, a single parent, erm, for women who work and have families they have their old conflict between what they're doing, doing at home and what they're doing at their work and who should have a priority. So I think erm, just a combination of trying to get through the week can be a sort of depression for many women. How do you cope with it, the ninety three of you who get depressed from time to time, whether it's severely or or or or not so severely? I think it's a matter of giving yourself time of accepting that maybe you're feeling low or I fe , when I'm feeling low I say right, I can't cope with things I've got to give myself some time where nothing's gonna bother me, if I can manage it, an hour, half an hour, just doing something for myself that I really like and that helps me once I accept myself as being depressed then it helps alleviate the stress involved with it. Is that something you think would work for everyone. I think it's worth a try. Doing something you like, if you can give yourself half an hour, or an hour, you know just say this is for me, and for me only. Mm mm. I think with erm, I I was brought up in a household where it was com , completely legitimate to admit to being depressed and that you would just have to cope, I think cope perhaps my most Mm. least favourite word in the entire language! Women coping all over the Mm. place with Mm. all sorts of terrible stresses and the only sort of legitimate reason for collapsing is to allow somebody else to cope beautifully with your collapse. I think with er, it's very interesting that people are actually admitting that they feel depressed and they have strategies for dealing with it. I'm sure it's re relatively recent. It probably is. It'll be useful Mm. to hear more of the strategies. Yes? I think it's important to get a listening ear and know that there are other people around who will give you support. You have to search that out. I'm not su , absolutely convinced, in terms of saying Mm. having an hour away from it is enough, I think there are a number of women who need to look and get support from somewhere. Is that hard to do would you say? Erm I think well I think it is, at times. I think in terms of people knowing, in terms of women knowing where they actually can get that support from. And also actually getting them there, themselves there in the first place is very difficult. Where's the yes? I think it helps if you can identify whether the the erm depression is just caused by erm the circumstances round about you which can be alleviated by changing them or if it's caused by eating habits or erm or erm hormones or chemical imbalances in, I've suffered, I think, from all them as well! Say like erm th stresses we're all under will cause depression, but after my had my children I suffered from reactive hyperglycaemia, low blood sugar, and we , that was glucose intolerance and I think an awful lot of women erm, suffer th from this and it's not erm found out and knowing the glucose intolerance I can understand how a lot of children erm, suffer from er problems with eating habits because I think this is being discovered more and more Mm mm. and I think society should be erm, trying to get to the root cause of like, chemical imbalances and eating problems rather than just putting people on tranquillizers. Well I wonder how many people here, I mean ninety three people say they ha , they th they occasionally do get depressed, I wonder if you ever have taken er, mood controlling drugs such as tranquillizers? Have you? Button one for yes, button two for no. It's erm it's regarded as er as an increasing problem er amongst women. Thirty nine have. Now we're talking about how you cope, the thirty nine who have do they work? Don't they work? Would you recommend it or wouldn't you? And obviously everybody has a different experience of this. Yes? Er, I actually had two stillborn babies, one one year after each other and they put me on Valium and it didn't do me any good at all! And my little boy was he was only about three at the time and I used to be used to angry at him and my neighbour used to come in and take him. And I was married to a soldier so I didn't have any family round about me at the time so it was it was pretty hard. And coming off valium was a lot harder because you don't realize that when you're on it you can't get back off it again. Did you, did you get help coming off it? Erm Well you were obviously, well you prescribed it in the first place Well that was supposed to be help. it was, it was actually there was a programme on television and my husband took me to the doctor and he said he felt I'd been on it too long, I'd been on it about six months and when I come off it, I come off it pretty quick and I ended up erm I didn't know what was wrong with me and it ended up I've now got epilepsy, and they didn't know if it was caused through erm I took a stroke about three four month after that and then I got the epilepsy as well, so they don't know if that me coming off it Mm mm. straight away, I just stopped it. Down there. Erm, I was erm, put on just for in ninety seventy three and your question that you're asked was and from nineteen seventy three till three years ago erm I know took my causes, I trust, put my trust in the doctors and erm over all those years I didn't realize that it was actually the tablets that was causing me the mental illness. And saying that, in the last three years I since discovered, and it was quite difficult to, which I did find, that there was alternative erm therapists, which was lots of groups that were going on and once I got into it erm the , it opened up a new, you know I ne I've never saw the light at the tunnel that is shining brightly now! Has anybody had the opposite experience with er with the kind of the drugs we're talking about, whereby they have been helpful and th , and they, and they would recommend them? Yeah? Er, I think anti-depressants can be helpful for a certain length of time but not for over a prolonged period of time. Erm and I think there's a big difference between them and tranquillizers and people tend to get the two mixed up. I think tranquillizers can be useful as well for a very short time limited period. Erm, but I certainly found anti-depressants helpful. Mm. Yes? Yes. I just wanted to say that speaking as a psychiatrist Mhm. valium is not an accepted treatment for depression and that we have excellent anti-depressant drugs, particularly ones that have come just in recent years that are very effective for depression, and I think bringing a great deal of benefit to depressed people. Well Ray say,i i I mean it's important that we yo you find out whether you are depressive, whether you have er ag , oh, something clinically wrong with you, whether you're just feeling a bit down. But perhaps we don't really know enough and we don't know where to go for information, I mean I don't know er I, I I'm not an expert but there are experts here, how would you assess the services available to people who feel they do need help, or for people who perhaps don't know they need help? Yes? Yes I think the situation in Scotland is very poor! I'm, I'm an alternative medicine practitioner and I tend to get a lot of people who are depressed coming to see me, people who have been through the normal routes Mhm. gone to their GP's, and often have been given some sort of medicine for their depression but haven't had the counselling side of things dealt with and they've just been given re-prescriptions, not necessarily seen every time for a re-prescription. Behind you. I think there are a number of counselling services available, but I also think it's very difficult sometimes for women to get there Mhm. and it's it's something about the shame around depression that we don't actually come forward for counselling and there's certainly not enough free counselling services in Scotland. There. I'm also an alternative therapist and I do find that this is one of the major problems, that ninety percent of my patients who come to me suffer from stress and depression, and really what has happened in a lot of cases is that they have been put on valium and drugs, they find the side effects are horrific! And actually really in a last resort in many cases they come to you. Mm. Mm. I went through a period of depression erm I'd been attending the doctor I'd been told that I was suffering from various illnesses, but nothing helped. I was given anti- depressants, that didn't help and it wasn't until four years later when they actually admitted me to hospital and then an ulcer and the depression disappeared once it had been diagnosed. But all the time I'd been attending the doctor I'd been told, first of all it was gall stones Mm. then it was something else Mm. then it was something else and I honestly thought the doctor thought I was cracked! There's nothing the matter with me! And I was taken into hospital and it was an ulcer and the depression disappeared after that. Mm. There. I think speaking as another psychiatrist er the medical profession do have to look very carefully and perhaps how a lot of the damage has been done er with how women perceive whether they can ask for help or not because a lot of the women here have raised been giving tranquillizers and my colleague across there has pointed out that tranquillizers are not an appropriate way of treating depression. Mhm. And diagnosis is very, very important that, if you have a medical, clinical state of depression try and pull yourself out of it, by your, your own efforts and doing alternative things is not necessarily going to be effective. And diagnosis is very important, as a psychiatrist again, training our medical students, we are trying to do a lot of education along that line because perhaps some of the older GP's, along the way, have not recognised the importance of this. Well I, I went to a psychiatrist once looking for a self-help group cos I didn't want tablets or anything I just wanted somebody I could talk to. Mhm. But what I found when I went was I had to go through the psychiatrist to find this group cos it wasn't available. My doctor didn't know anything about it. So having gone there I got counselling which I found was very useful to me. More useful than all the medications and so forth like them. So once you found it Aha. it was helpful? Yes? Up there. Yes. Now, when I took post-natal depression I asked my health visitor, you know, where do you go? And she sent me to a mother and toddler group, I mean, she didn't tell me about any self-help groups, it's mother and toddler, she just said take you and the baby and go to mother and toddler and that'll be it. And that's all the help I got from my G P. Beside you. I found that erm, we run par , a self-help group as well for ladies with post-natal depression Mhm. and I found, for me personally and a lot of other mothers that it started in pregnancy. Now, I don't know if anybody's had the experience but they're only interested in your unborn child, they're not interested in how you feel at that time. I mean, you think you give birth and you're forgotten, I mean your health visitor visits your baby, and then you've got the baby blues, and we we are trying to do something to get them to help and warn people about when they are pregnant it can happen because it does start then, not after you've had the baby, it builds up and them wham, it hits you! Yes? I think mental illness isn't taken seriously enough. I think that er, there's a problem, first of all you've identified that women experience er, depression and I think that's not taken very seriously by policy makers and people in power,na namely men. I think women get depressed but men suffer from stress which is somehow more respectable it's more macho, it's associated with work and Aha. you know, there are all sorts of means of dealing with stress Mhm. which are not always open to women. But it's more pu , you know, it's almost de rigueur,mo amongst certain types of executive to be suffering from stress. And I suspect it's the same kind of actual physical complaint that women who complained of being depressed have. Yes? Women have a lot different stress than men. Men Mm. go out nine to five to work, they are stressed nine till five, women, especially women with children have it twenty Mhm. four hours a day, they don't have a nine to five job, they're on call twenty four hours a day and that's a lot more stressful. Mhm. I think that men tend to rely more on a crutch such as alcohol I don't if it relieves Mm mm. the problem more but it tends to be men that cope in that way and women aren't seen to cope as well, maybe they just don't use things like alcohol Mhm. as much as the men. Well I'm vo involved in Crossline which is a a Christian run telephone helpline, erm, we off , also offer free counselling and they find that er, there's more men will actually pick up the telephone, cos they're not seen erm, whereas more women will actually come in for face to face counselling. I think it's a stigma that a lot of men feel they can't show that they're depressed or they've got a problem so they'll pick up a ph , a phone. Yes? Well as the speaker before last mentioned, men are in fact diagnosed twice as often as women are suffering from alcoholism. I think men tend to act out their depression more than women. Yes? I'd just like to raise a point that erm most men are psychiat , er mo most of the psychiatrists are men and that a lot of the diagnosis I feel, come from a very sort of patriarchal view erm, you know a lot of have sort of brought up the alternative sort of er medicine and er self-help groups, and to me, having been through psychiatry which is a, a huge machine that is very difficult to get out that er to me, that's the only future and there's millions of pounds going into psychiatry and we're reviewing it now with community care plans which, I I don't think anybody is actually clear about but er, you know, the the millions that are put into psychiatry, I'd like to see more sort of counselling er, become available or, more money given to sort of er mental health associations. Mhm. Following, from what was said there we know that there's, that there's a limited pot for mental health because that's the way it's going to be, we've been told that so there's a real big job for women Mhm. to look at er, a P R job about changing the way those resources are used so that they're used in the way that's been talked away, er, talked about tonight which is way that clearly many wo , many women want to see them being used. And women have to got to get, get out there and ensure that the people who do plan the way that these services are are operated and managed an an all the things evaluated, that women have a real say in that. Which women? The women who are the professionals in the field or being No. The women who will use the services, women who have used the services in the past, and women who will use them in the future, and that's all of us. Now, say more about that practically, because I mean if you're depressed, you may feel too depressed to go to a a professional, you may have great difficulty getting there for whatever reason because you're ashamed as someone mentioned, you're embarrassed, you don't want to admit you can't cope, which is a syndrome once you get there how do you pluck up the courage to say well actually what your offering me isn't good enough, I've heard on on television there is something better and I want it? Gosh! There'll be other people here who I'm sure who have done it. But, it's up to organisations like the ones we work for to respond to that and to not be doing the planning on behalf of other people. Yes? I think we're still talking here about depression and how to go and Mm. find a cure erm perhaps we should try and think about why we get depressed in the first place, I know there's lot of people who co , here have had problems. I think it's important to find space for ourselves which sometimes we just don't do. You know, find things to do to occupy ourselves in other ways. You mean cope? Mm. Well, no not cope but to to enable us to cope we have find space for ourselves, do something, purely for ourselves rather than always be thinking about our children, thinking about the home thinking about the family, we're as important and I think that's what people must realize to begin with. Yes? I suffer more from a feeling of guilt, perhaps than men do. I think it's part of a vicious circle, that sometimes it's guilt which leads to depression and then women feel guilty about being depressed and that's why they take what is on offer to them. I think there's a great cult of perfection amongst women, that they're trying to be all Aha. things to all people all the time. Research has shown recently that erm a life event, such as you described can precipitate depression in someone who's self esteem is low and I think this is where we women are more vulnerable. Although we've advanced a great deal in the last fifty years, we still have a way to go and our self esteem is lower than men. I want to turn this right round because a couple of people have mentioned guilt and er I I suspect that one of the reasons that women are a bit worried about talking about depression or or campaigning for changes in policy, or more funding, or or whatever, is that for a long time women have been thought of as the weaker sex, more emotional, more nervous, by a, a a male establishment, I'm talking about past centuries, isn't there a case for saying there's actually we have a right to be depressed, I mean, obviously it's normal, ninety three of you get depressed from time to time, the majority of you don't think you clinically depressive if it is, if it's normal to be depressed shouldn't the services to cope with depression, if we need outside help, be there and there's no shame in it? I mean, you've got the right to go to the dentist, the right to go to the doctor! Yes? I think what would be helpful for all of us is to think of our er mental health rather than mental illness Mhm. and er, you know it's part of a spectrum, and if we're all as aware of er mental health as we are with physical health now, and if that was, was carried out in public education campaigns and in schools, I think you're right, we would have this right to mental illness as part of a overall mental health. Ray? Erm, it is part of the e education curriculum and design, the development of inter-personal, pschyo-motor and cognition skills apparently so if the experts e actually gave me galloping schizophrenia because on one hand I thought hallelujah and in the other hand will we make as mak , bigger mess of this as they did in multi=sensory teaching methods in a coordinative approach to learning? What are the experts view on this? How are they going to manage to implement this without making the situation any worse! You'll blind us with science if we go into that right now! Yes? Erm, I think one of the important bits is th , the issue of why is is part of it, why people get depressed? And I think it's, a great deal of it is to do with failed expectations. Whose? And people get depressed, like when they're dealing with bereavement, that's an event in a person's life and causes short term dis , short term, very intense distress, but that's different from the way we're constructed through the media and all sorts of ways to be super mothers, super wives, super kiddie and a super this that and the next thing which none of use can meet all these demands at one go! But because, the media hold out these expectations as the norm and people can't meet them all, they then feel failures Aha. and that is also why, going back to a point earlier on, why I think erm counselling and alternative medicine, and so on, is marginalized it would be such a rock to the social order to actually acknowledge that people are in distress because it's the social order that's causing that distress. It's the media again! But it's tru And the patriarchal society. But I just wanted to bring up some of the underlying reasons for depression, and one of the large things that society is having to address just now is child sexual abuse Mhm. which er er in my profession as well I come up against all the time and I I think that we're not really acknowledging that that is very often a cause, for men and women Mhm. er of future mental health problems. Beside you. Yes. I I wonder really, the only rational appro , response to the world at the moment isn't to be depressed, I mean, everyone looks around famines in Africa, and war and jus and depredation Mm Mhm. all around us Mhm. as well as more domestic problems within Scotland of unemployment and so on, I mean, really depression should be regarded as a normal response Mm. and what women are experiencing half the time is perfectly rational. Yes. I don't actually believe that that depression is normal, I believe that we can overcome depression, and I think there is some creative things that we can do out of a depression people can become stronger, they can tap into their resources inside with support and help, so I can believe it's a positive experience. Mhm. I think that it's important to recognize that to have a depressed mood is not to have a depressed illness Mhm. we all can get depressed if we're talking about a mood state, that's not an illness. Depression, as an illness is not normal any more than having an ulcer Mm. or a coronary is normal, and I think again, that stops people for asking for help because the they're not sure whether it's a depressed mood or an illness. If it's an illness it's a stigma. I think it's also part that you know, you're walking along the street and you bump into somebody and they'll say, well how you doing today? Say, oh I'm fine! You never say, I'm depressed, and they're never really listening for you to actually say how you really are. Our society goes round all the time expecting everybody to be fine, to be happy, to be cheerful, you know! You're not allowed just in your day to day life to say to somebody, unless you know them really well, it's the shits today! Well I'm afraid we're out of time there ! There is help if you need it, out there and I hope, you may have heard something helpful tonight and er if you feel inclined to change things, I think everybody here would encourage you. Goodnight. Erm somebody I know has asked me to er You know I don't know if you know how they compile dictionaries? No. Well they they read stuff and they get tape recordings of people talking and they go through and Mhm. analyze it and they see Mm. how words are used. Yeah. Because the language changes all the time, Right. and they have to keep them up to date. Right. And that's about What what what it is is they've just someone's asked me if I'll just do some recordings of some of the lessons. Also it'll help me to see er if I'm doing the lesson properly. Oh right, yeah. Er it's totally anonymous. It's typed up, they don't use the tape itself, they type No. it up from it with all sorts of weird accents and things put in, Alright. and anything that could identify anyone is taken out. So that's that's a bit what it's about. Erm it's tied up with Dictionary, it's and and that kind of D do you know of the project? No don't know that. Okay it's University and do that one. But they all work more or less the same. Could I turn that off? Oh sure yeah. The little red button on the top. The little red button on the top? Oh green o it's the green one . . So that should be recording now . Spinning away there. Yeah. And then it won't it won't bother us at all will it? Erm Yeah there's that maths paper. Okay. Now then part of it is they ask me You don't have to, but they ask me to ask people to sign erm to say It's just to say that you don't mind your conversation being used. But they won't There'll be nothing in it to identify you. Oh sure yeah. They take out everything. I believe you. It's it's very it's all done very professionally in that it's very well controlled. Have you got the paper? Right. Have you had a look through? Yeah I had a look er through it just before when I got it. Okay. It's been stuck in my bag all day. Now when you looked through it and it wasn't an exam, twenty sixth or something was it ? Yeah. Did you think, Oh, of course, oh I could have done that, but Yeah. any like that? Erm there's a couple yeah. So we'll have a look at those and see if we can see why in the exam Yeah. it didn't That was obvious. . Okay. So what have we got? And this one yeah. Okay. Erm . Erm what did you think when you saw it in the exam? Erm I just erm read the question like and I just I I I thought it'd be like a triangle, you work it out on the triangle and then I thought no that Okay. can't be right. Cos it's so much longer, the actual distance it swings through, dunno if it'd be flat. Right. So when you looked at in the in the exam, did you think, Oh, they're not giving me enough information here, or There's some trick I don't know, or what did you think about it? I just thought it was erm I dunno, I ju I j just figured they were trying to get us to draw it draw it into a triangle.. Well did did you answer the question? Er no cos I realized that I was that it was totally wrong so I just gave it a miss and went on to something else . So you th so you thought, Ah, draw a triangle, and then when you sort of Did you start it start the question at all? Yeah, I drew the triangle on the paper and I realized And then you thought, Oh that's wrong . No that's I mean you didn't go back? So you realized it was wrong? Yeah. You thought, Oh, it's not a triangle. So, what is it? It's like an arc like. It's an arc. Right so you can see now how to do it? Yeah. And how d how do you it? Er you measure get the erm well measure the whole circumference first, That's it. and then take that as a proportion of the Mhm. circumference. Good. So you you're looking at It's not a question of erm doing much calculating or anything else, it's just seeing what the problem is, isn't it? Yeah. If someone got the pendulum, gave it a flick Yeah. and it went all the way round, no problem there. Two pi R. But it doesn't, it just does Is it forty thirty degrees? Mm. It's thirty over three sixty. So what was that? Three marks. So it wasn't a lot on that anyway, but it it it's don't forget that's a good indication. I mean if they're only giving three marks for it you're not going to do a lot of geometry and all sorts of constructions and complicated things. No. It's going to be fairly straightforward. So without knowing any more than you knew when you sat the exam,you could pick up an extra three marks there. Yeah. Yeah. Just by not being thrown by the question. Mhm. Or Er don't forget, part of it especially in an exam,erm part of solving er any problem is, Oh, I know how to do this. Ah, that doesn't work. . And then you go back. You find out what's wrong with what you've done and sort of go off in another direction, or maybe follow the same direction slightly and veer off. So don't be put off when your first attempt doesn't work. Yeah. There's still time in an exam, if you realize soon enough as you did, to have another go. Now what about this one? That one. I I figured erm C er s complete accurately below accurately below the part of the wind that shows wind directions . So I measured that, it was about five centimetres. Right. And so I figured that Complete must mean continue on. Er but I did it at a scale like erm one centimetre for o for every hour it's blowing in that direction. So I wrote it along the top of the er paper I was using. Mm. And I thi and erm I think west was seven, and that's only five centimetres, so I extended it another two centimetres . Oh. And I thought it was complete like. And then and then completed the rest of it. But what I should have done was measured that,that would have been about forty nine centimetres, this'd be out maybe Right. seven millimetres . Right. So that was sort of completely misunderstanding the question, Yeah. really. You're maki making a an assumption that they're obviously going to use a scale of Yeah. one centimetre to whatever it is,one. I mean thi this wind force here, er what are they? They go up to Did you do the first part of it? Yeah. Yeah I did that. Mm. the the eight angles divided by three hundred and sixty so three si three hundred and sixty divided by eight. Erm well let's have a look, again. The wind blows from the north, okay. Calculate the size of the interior angle of the regular octagon. Let's have a little bit of paper and have a look at that. You've Have you had your paper back? Erm y it back today. Yeah. And er then he took it back of us for some reason. . That's teachers. . Not very helpful was it? Okay. A regular octagon. Erm how about if I leave you to do that one? I'll make mine a regular hexagon. Oh yeah. Okay. So if you want to draw a hexagon erm how many points equally spaced around the circle? We're going to draw a hexagon inside the circle . Yes there's six. Six, okay. And where will they come? Zero degrees,Where's the next one? Erm I see, that erm This one is That's sixty degrees it yeah . Right. So you're going to divide three sixty into six equal arcs I see yeah. of sixty. And the next one? That's a hundred and twenty. Okay. And then? A hundred and eighty and erm then two hundred and forty. Okay. And er three hundred. Okay. And then you're back to the three sixty or nought again. Oh I see yeah. Okay. So we've got got a a rule somewhere. my ruler . I keep losing my set squares and rules and things. There's one though. Okay where was the centre of that? Right. Now this is a hexagon. Erm join that up, okay. and we should finish up with about six sides roughly. Now while I finish it off, if you'd like to just measure one of the interior angles that I've already done. And what's it come to? A hundred and twenty degrees. A hundred and twenty. Okay. Now according to your theory that you were applying to that Yeah. one, you just divide You say it's a six-sided figure, divide three sixty by six Oh right yeah. Oops. What angle does that give, that that sixty degrees? Where could you find that angle? Erm Could be oppo other side there if that was extended. Okay. I think so, if this was this this was extended . Oh, right. So if you extended that That bit there. That would be That is sixty. Now we've got a very special case here haven't we? Yeah. Because we've got sixties all over the place so maybe it wasn't a brilliant one to try but it gives us some indication of what's going on. Where's another? Another sixty? Erm between these, connected. Okay. Any other ones? No. Right. Now that one is bound to be sixty, the the angle at the centre, because that was how we made it. Yeah. Put that down and we thought right draw the circle,space it out equally,six equal angles is what we were doing at the same time as six equal arcs, all at sixty degrees, or all at one sixth of three sixty. Right yeah. Okay. Now the octagon. Could you do that one? Okay. So we'll make a little centre somewhere. Right. Okay. Right. Okay. Erm So what's the angle going to be? How are you working it out? Erm be three sixty divided by eight. Okay. What does that come to? Erm about About . Erm yeah . Use your calculator . So that's three sixty er Could you do three sixty divided by four? It's nine yeah so four and a half. Okay, so forty five. Okay. You start from wherever you like. start that way up. Bit easier. Good. So you'll get all your right angles marked, each ninety, and then the halfway points between Yeah. each ninety. This is I mean you wouldn't do this in an exam, you wouldn't draw one and work how you draw it, but by doing it now erm you get to know a regular figure. You get to know sort of how to construct one. I mean now if i said, Make me a a figure that's got ten equal sides, you could do it couldn't you? Yeah. Or twenty. So you could construct those. And then join the join these points up to the centre. Get that out of your way. So you'll be able to see. Well you know what the angle's going to be at the centre already don't you without Yeah. without measuring, cos it because of the way you constructed it. It's got to be forty five. So we can then when we've drawn that,find out what the other angles are,and try and work out what will always be true and what will depend on which angle you choose. If we draw a join a few of those up through the centre, just so we can mark the angle. So you can join any two opposite corners and it'll go through the centre . Yeah. Erm In fact you might as well do the last one as well. So what angle do you know absolutely definitely without thinking about it ? . And that is what? Forty five. That's forty five. That's your three sixty divided by eight. Okay. . And you've got lots of lots of triangles that are the same. That's forty five right? That's forty five. It looks forty five. Definitely. Yeah. Erm how can you tell it's forty five? Well I mean is there any way you could It's erm prove it? I mean you could measure it maybe and say Yeah. Okay it comes to forty five. You could draw lots of these figures. You did another one sixty, and it came to sixty. Yeah. Well it'd be for the this angle if you extended it so it'd be eight divided by the three sixty isn't it? Erm Three sixty divided by eight. It looks it looks as if it is. I'm not Yeah. disputing if it whether it is or it isn't, but how can we show that it is? How can we say , Erm Well it always will be? Oh right erm Think about what sort of things add up to one eighty. Yeah it'll be all all the angles on this line. Okay. Erm Let's say if we marked This is forty five degrees. Yeah. Okay. What about these two angles, what do we know about them? Oh right they've got to add up to a hundred and eighty Right. right. They're both the same angle for a start, because we've got an isosceles triangle, and forty five plus two X must add up to a hundred and eighty. Yeah. That one there is also X. So here we've got this angle plus two X . Yeah so the two X minus one eighty is Okay. the outer one. It'll always be that one. So this'll work for anything. Now,what was the question? What did they ask? A size of the interior angle of the regular octagon. What do they mean by the interior angle? The angle between these two points. Right. And what should it be? Erm A hundred and a hundred and thirty five. Okay. Right I see . So you've got the right idea of dividing it by eight, but you needed to take it on a stage and see what the was. Erm like I divided Yeah. divi divided divided by eight then minus one eighty. Mm. That'd get that angle all the time. Right. Yeah. It'll always work. Now the other question they've got is,What is the angle between the two rectangles? Well there's one rectangle and there's the other one at right angles to this one. What's that angle going to be? It looks like forty five. Erm It looks like forty five, and it's almost certainly going to be forty five, and we could probably work out some reason why it please to read yours about monster, so I'll have the two monster ones first and then the two home ones. Right, just sit down for a minute and let's, Michael read his first. The monster from the marsh. I saw the monster arrive from the marsh he looked at the when I saw him I ran The monster from the marsh. When I was walking past the marsh one, one night, when I was on my way back from school I heard a rus rustling noise behind a bu bush, when I went up the, went up first to the bush a big dragon-like thing jumped out from behind the bush, it gave me such a fright I nearly fainted. I started to run up, straight up the hill, erm lucky the monster was running straight at me and sticking out of the crowd and he tripped over and after the end My home. My home is near the trees and I live there in, in my house there is I have lots of places in my and I have one one pigeon and a dog. My home is made of wood, and the roof is made of tin and the colour of it is grey. It has two doors, one, four windows, I, I don't have the garden or, oh, in my house there are six rooms and one of them is er, one, one of them is my, is my room and a picture and a my my, and room and er My home. I live in a tree so does my mum tree house, my mum and my dad and my brother and my dog and dad live there. Our house is made of wood and is dark green. We have four windows and four doors, we have got a there is a big hill in front of it and it is good, but if it, if the tree house because we find the, the trees and then and then we were, we play in the tree house sometimes with the dog. Inside our home we have a lot of furniture, we have four rooms, one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in the lounge and one in the kitchen Right then. I like erm, Christopher and Simon yes I know, take your books and show right, erm, Jonathan here right John has written a story about his home right it's a good descriptive story on how people live until one day they couldn't think of any way that you could may improve it. My home. I live in a tree house, my mum and my dad and my brother and my dog and my sister. Our house is made of wood and is dark green, we have a four windows and four doors. It has got wooden roof. There is a big hill in front of it and it is good but erm because we climb the, the tree and climb it and we play in the tree house today with the dog. Inside our home we have a lot of furniture we have four rooms and one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in and one in the lounge and one in the kitchen here Okay, right So if we cut out the one they might it might flow a bit more easily might it. That's good, it was alright apart from that you describe where John and are living well Yeah, I didn't see which sort of No, did he describe the house though? Yeah Yeah, I think his description of where he was living in the tree house was very clear I think he could improve it just a bit Jonathan and then it might flow a bit more evenly, might it then, right Michael bring yours out now please. Just a minute John, right Michael I want you to read yours through once more for me please. Do it about the monster Monster from the marsh. When I saw the monster from the marsh, one night, I was, I was, I was frightened, I, I, I, I was he looked liked a when I saw him I ran back to camp and I felt frightened, I hid under my sleeping bag the end Right, see Michael was describing that how he felt Yeah How did feel then? Frightened You think that he came out quite What Christine has said then do you think? Well you said he went under a sleeping bag Aha and just, I hid under my sleeping bag, er, then, I thought er the mon what would happen to the monster and so he might of stayed there on, you know, all, all night John Well he did say that the monster was rather large, he looked like a bird with some feathers plucked out What else could you bring in his bag? Anything else he could of put in the hat Liam? He vaguely saw the monster and then he ran back to the camp where he was camping, but he didn't describe Where, where Yeah, where So he could of put a little bit in about how he ran back Yeah and what he went through in, in that couldn't he? Yeah Right, the people who have not read an essay out yet, I want you to sit, just a minute Michael, next to somebody and I want you to read your essay to them and see what they think about it and how you could maybe improve it and I want Michael and John to go and show Steve your books as well now please, right boys do that now then, yes, could you take yours to show please Do we have to show both? Not sure it's still working. It's still working The thingy Is it recording us? Is it recording? Yeah My dad's got all this Sorry Steve, erm, that you're not going to read your essay and and that isn't essay, either work your book or, and get it er, yes, well it has to be up and when you've finished it you can then do a picture about your at the meeting of the accounts and the reports o an of the directors and auditors for the year ended thirty first December eighty nine and the final dividend for nineteen eighty nine. Secondly, the re-election of directors retiring er, and thirdly the appointment of the audit auditors and their remuneration. The A G M will be followed, er, directly after this meeting, er, by an extraordinary general meeting erm to propose, er, an increase in the authorized share capital to seek authority to create new preference share capital to renew the board's power to allot shares to seek authority to purchase our own shares to reduce share capital by repaying existing preference shares to make some amendments to the employee share schemes to increase the aggregate amount available for directors' fees and to enable the company to issue summary financial statements. I'll now call upon David of Coopers and Lybrand to read the report of the auditors to the members. Thank you David. Erm next, er I shall be proposing a resolution to receive the report and accounts and to declare a dividend. Then before putting the resolution to the vote I shall say a few words and ask whether, ah, there are any questions. The report and accounts have been in your hands for the statutory period er, and you've had the chance to read my statement. I therefore propose that the report of the directors and the audited accounts for the year ended thirty first December nineteen eighty nine now submitted to this meeting be and are hereby er, received and that the final dividend of twelve point five pence, er, net per share, recommended by the directors be and is hereby declared payable on first June nineteen ninety, to holders of ordinary shares of the company on the register, three P M on fourth of May nineteen ninety. We are entering the nineteen nineties as a well-defined well-balanced company both in the spread of our businesses and the geographical spread of our markets. We now generate sixty five percent of our sales outside the United Kingdom. We had another excellent year in nineteen eighty nine with a twenty percent increase in earnings per share and a nineteen percent increase in dividends per share. Since eighty two er, when we merged the two Pearson public companies we have increased Pearson's earnings per share and dividends four-fold. We have achieved this by selling top quality products and services expertly and aggressively in the international marketplace by acquiring businesses which complement and support our four chosen areas of operation and by disposing of businesses which had no obvious place in those areas. I explained in my statement in the annual report about the management reorganisation which occurred at the end of nineteen eighty nine. Although Frank has been a director of Pearson since nineteen eighty six and those of you been to this meeting in the last few years will have seen him before I'd like to introduce, ah, Frank to you in his new capacity Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer at Pearson. Frank, will you take a bow. Erm, many of you will also have seen Jean-Claude at previous meetings which he attended in the capacity as to Michel . I'd like to welcome Jean-Claude to this his first A G M as a full member of the board. Er, now to move on to events that have happened since the, er, annual report was printed many of you will no doubt have seen in the press that the same time as we announced our results at the end of March that we agreed to buy, er, the Alton Towers theme park er, in Staffordshire, from John , for sixty million pounds er, the purchase has now been completed. Erm, Alton Towers is a really marvellous addition to the Group er, which intends to develop the business further both by attracting more visitors er, with new and exciting rides and also, er, by, through their unique knack of increasing visitor spending levels. Er, we also announced at the same time as the Alton, er, Towers acquisition that Longman had acquired Rank Training for eleven and a half million pounds. Er, this company has a leading position, er, in the fast expanding field of video training products for the corporate market and that's an area which Longman has identified, er, as a new area for expansion. Longman is already one of the U K's leading providers of business education materials and will use this base to develop and expand the Rank Training business. If the early nineteen nineties are as testing a time for U S and U K markets as many people predict I'm nonetheless confident that Pearson is better placed than most companies to withstand this. In the first quarter of this year we've seen more moderate growth in those geographical areas but in nineteen eighty nine nearly forty percent of Pearson's trading ca profit came from economies outside the U K and North America and we expect our activities in these other areas to continue to grow at a satisfactory rate. Well, I think that concludes, er, the, er er, remarks that I'd like to, er, make. I've already put the, er, resolution to the shareholders but, erm er, before voting on it I'd be pleased to answer any questions. And could you, could you say your name and My name is Mr , I am an ordinary shareholder of some years' standing. I welcome your speech because you have a quite a good habit of optimistic outlook future which is contrary to what a lot of other chairmen are saying. it does, it does the company very very no chance in the following year share prices have dropped enormously. I noted you that the company bought Alton Towers. Now I'm not I'm asking is whether its shareholders could write in to apply for a concessionary ticket to Alton Towers and get a reduced price if they so wish. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr . Er er, I've, er I just I'm just saying that, er, that, that last year er, when I made a few remarks that they were misquoted by Reuters and we did leave the meeting and the share price dropped by er, several P and we had to send out a correcting statement so this year we've taken the precaution of issuing a press release er, at the same time as er, er, I'm making these remarks so I hope at least they won't be misinterpreted. Erm as to I think I heard you say er, ask about concessionary prices to Alton Towers, was that correct? Ya. Well er we, we've taken a, a, a policy view over the years because the group has a number of er very attractive er products and, and, and, and shareholders have frequently asked if was possible erm, to have concessions in all sorts of areas and the view we've taken is that it involves a, a, a, a, a great deal of administration and that our real job is to er increase the profits of the business er,a as well as we can and then to pay dividends to the shareholders erm who will er, er, then use that money er, hopefully to buy a good number of our products. Yes sir. Good morning. My name is and, er it appears to me, sir that you like to make life difficult for the managers to negotiate wage settlements with the employees of the company I note that your salary has increased by more than fifty percent in one year. That I don't think will please John Major or Mrs Thatcher for being, er seeing you fuelling and other directors and all the directors of our public companies fuelling inflation with their inflationary wage rises doesn't seem reasonable whatsoever and I think that er one should consider this in a different light. Thank you for er, question. There's been quite a lot of comment in the press erm, on high levels of, of salary of, of remu remuneration for directors and I think it might be helpful er, if I was were t were, were to make some general remarks on the background er, of how we er, approach directors' remuneration. On the question of my own er er, er, position I think I would ask, er, in a minute to have Sir Simon to say something because er, er, er, I don't, I I, you know, I don't set my own remuneration. Er, and in general we have a, er, panel of the non-executive directors who set the directors' salary in relation to the other directors I am also on that panel er, but obviously not in relation to my own salary. Erm we have, er, access to the advice of professional advisers, namely and Co our policy is to keep base salaries at the mid-point of market competitive range erm, and provide bonus opportunities that can lift total take home pay into the upper quartile. Erm the bonus element of the Pearson scheme is highly leveraged we are very keen to achieve above-average performance for our shareholders and let me give you an example, if in nineteen ninety erm Pearsons as a company achieved say five percent growth in earnings per share erm the directors' remuneration, and by the way that's not a forecast so I want to make that absolutely clear, it's just an illustration if earnings per share increase by five percent and you could say, er, therefore we would expect directors' remuneration to be perhaps increased by five percent that wouldn't be the case at all our directors' salaries would actually halve erm, Ill say that again, directors' total take home pay would halve because the salary element wouldn't, wouldn't alter. Erm so er i i i er, I think that erm, er er er y you'll see that erm th th the the situation isn't, erm, er, perhaps quite as simple a a as you might, erm as you might think erm and, er, next year if that happened er, perhaps there'd be headlines saying Pearson directors er, half their remuneration. Erm and the reason we set this is that we are erm er the er, er we believe that this above average er growth in the in the, erm, er, earnings per share of the company is what shareh increases in shareholder value really depend on and er again to give an example erm, if you take the, the, the, the, the, the F T S E a hundred companies erm, and you do analyses of their er, growth rates and earnings per share you will find that the average growth rate was eleven and a half percent and ours er, was er, twenty, twenty percent so it's above average remuneration erm, er, er, for above av for above average performance. And I don't think I can say much more than that but perhaps Simon I hardly feel, sir, that erm erm you don't have some influence on your salaries and the other directors' salaries, I've heard a lot of directors and chairmen say that they have no influence on their own salaries. This doesn't cut any ice with me because I believe that none of these directors would be in on the board if they weren't invited there by yourself. So erm Erm well, I, I, I beg to correct you. Er these directors are the bosses of international, erm, companies themselves. They have no, they have no personal, erm, relationship with me er, I'll give you the example of one of our, erm er, er er erm, er most recent directors who's, who's just joined the board, Mr Ruben , who's the head of Colgate Palmo Palmolive, and I just described to him to you how we, erm how we, er er er er er selected him. We went to, er, we felt that we needed, er, a U S director because much of our business is in the U S with wide marketing experience we went to, erm, headhunters er, in America who drew up er, a list of sixty people, culled from their own research erm we narrowed that down as an executive to twelve. We presented these twelve names, er, to the board of Pearsons erm, the board selected three er, we kept one in reserve and I was sent out to America by the board to see, er, the two, er, leading candidates. Erm, I met Mr for the first time in the airport lounge at, erm er, er, Kennedy Airport erm, we discussed at great length and had a very interesting discussion erm, er, Pearsons erm, he accepted er, the job and h I, he has no obligation to me whatsoever and he is one of the er, members of the er, remuneration committee, and I actually take offence at what you're saying. Simon I'm very sorry you take offence, sir. no offence meant and I I really hope that you do not take offence in that way. Erm This may be out of order but, er, personal experience is that the, er, non-executive directors who were involved in the compensation made a recommendation that, er Michael 's salary be higher erm, than he in fact a agreed with, he requested that we lower it and in fact that was what was done. Well, I do hope that our public companies take into consideration inflation in the future. Er, thank you very much. I'm very Ladies sorry, sir, that if you took offence at anything I said. There was no offence meant. Thank you. La ladies and gentlemen Lord has asked me to say a few words about erm er, directors' salaries and particularly about his own. Now I don't stand here in any sense of defending these salaries, in fact I think our policy is entirely right and it is not inflationary. Ergo, we have to look, I think, at the record of this company over the last few years and as the chairman said in his introductory remarks the growth in the company, the growth in the earnings per share, has been very remarkable. The, er, credit to that goes to the chairman and chief executive and the executive directors and they are responsible for the business and it is right, in my view, that they should be rewarded for it and encouraged to take risks to work very hard on our behalf to ensure that that growth continues er, er, that benefits the, er, company, it benefits the country it benefits the er ergo, people who are working for it, it is not inflationary because we are looking at productivity and the productivity in the company has increased significantly. Now, as the chairman said we base the salaries of directors on two elements an element of base salary which looks at market levels and we ergo, have a fair base which reflects a sort of medium to upper level of companies of this size we then leverage, very carefully, a bonus scheme related to performance and I believe that is the right thing to do and I believe and so do my fellow directors who sit on that committee believe that it is one of the reasons that we've seen the great growth in this company over the last five years which you've achieved and which actually the Chancellor of the Exchequer would very glad about because it is increasing the wealth and the benefit of this country, particularly as a lot of those earnings are coming from overseas and will in, in time be repatriated in Britain. So I believe we're doing the right thing, I think it's for the good of the country I think it's for the good of the company and the shareholders. I'd just like to add er, that I didn't take offence at the question, I think it was a perfectly qu fair question, it was the, the inference of, of rigging salaries. Er right, could we go on to perhaps a less emotive issue. Er, my name's John . Could I make a constructive suggestion in this context of board salaries or remunerations or compensation packages or bonuses I'm saying that in a slightly tongue in cheek way because I believe that the majority of shareholders don't understand the differences between these concepts, as you gentlemen evidently do. Most ordinary shareholders have never had a total remuneration package and have never been part of a performance-related bonus scheme. Would you be prepared, er chairman and gentlemen to consider Pearson giving a lead in spelling out, in the next annual report the precise relationship between the bonus element and some parameter which I gather from your earlier remarks is probably earnings per share. I think this might help to defuse the whole situation which is getting a little bit hot, I've been to a lot of A G Ms recently and this topic is coming up at most and one feels that it almost may become an issue at the next general election. W would you be prepared to consider this at another, at, at a future board meeting? I think that's a very constructive suggestion and we'll certainly er, consider it er, in drawing up the er, annual report and accounts next year. Yes, lady at the back. Erm er, my name's , an ordinary shareholder for long-standing erm, it would be very interesting, I don't know whether this is possible now or maybe following on from what the speaker has said, if we had some idea of the American system which is er, I only know very little about it er I, just how that works because we have presidents and vice presidents and, er I think it work rather differently. So it would be rather interesting if we could have some sort of comparison. Would one of our American directors like to I would have to confess that by American standards the er er the, er, directors of Pearson, the executive directors of Pearson and er, the chairman of Pearson and I think that the directors of most English companies are significantly underpaid by U S standards that's not to say it's right but, er, that seems to be the, er ha the current trend. Actually, I, I didn't mean that, er regarding the actual amounts because I'm fully aware of the fact that the American ones are very much higher, it's merely the method by which they are erm My own feeling is that there is a great similarity and that there is a a base salary normally which is set on a competitive level with a target as in this case perhaps at the mid-point, perhaps at the sixty percent level or whatever it would be and that a significant uplift in compensation can be obtained by a bonus scheme, if the performance of the company as measured in earnings per share, return on capital, return on equity or any m other measure if those objectives are met. So I think that th the scheme that erm Pearson uses is er, not at all dissimilar to what would be a fairly standard practice in the United States. and people like that, but er, I believe that the, the way it's actually organized is different. It, again I have to, I have to say that talk about the company of which I'm chairman is that there is a personnel and compensation committee which in the absence of a chief executive sets the chief executive's remuneration and with the presence of the chief executive, although he's not, I'm not a member of that committee we work on the other senior executives of the company, it's quite similar to the process used here in your company. Yes sir. My name is I have been a shareholder and other members of my family for many years much has already been said about directors' and your particular erm, fees in particular. But er it, it, it er it appears to have been overlooked that, erm some of the directors who were in the bracket in nineteen eighty eight of two hundred and thirty thousand to two ninety five thousand have been increased from three hundred and fifty five thousand this year to a top of four hundred thousand. Er, you have also erm mentioned about the bonus er, can I take it from what you have said that this is profit-related? If not I suggest it should be and, er, therefore if unfortunately the profits of the company did go down in the foreseeable future the salaries of yourself and your directors would be reduced. As regards the salaries of the U S A we've read and seen about so many companies that pay sky-high for v various salaries and other schemes, we don't want that in this country but we do want a degree of evenness and I would repeat as somebody has already said, that your salary has gone up fifty six percent which is very, very high. Now there was one other thing if you would care to take it is that you said that it would involve a great deal of organization for concessionary tickets for Alton Towers or Tussauds or any others. Erm Ready Mix have a theme park in Th Thorpe Park and there's no problem there of issuing tickets to shareholders for erm, entertainment of their, their families. They d don't make so much fuss about it they distribute it and it gets on very satisfactory and people er, are very happy to receive these tickets. I think the question of turning it down, that a lot of work is er, forgive my bluntness nonsense. Er one other thing is the the share capital is sixty five billion pounds. It's true that we had a issue erm nineteen eighty five but the reserves are now six hundred and fifty million. Whether you have given this the same consideration of the increase in, er, directors' salaries I don't know, but I think y it's worthy of, er, a further consideration. Er one last thing er, do we need so many as eight non-executive directors which also to be paid? You've got five executive directors I should think that's adequate with one or two outside directors to bring outside knowledge or experience but, er thirteen is too many I suggest. Er well there are a number of, of points there and I'll, I'll try and cover them all. The first you asked again about, er, directors' salaries er, or directors' er er remuneration erm, and I would only say that all the directors are er bonuses are linked to earnings per share. Er, I hoped I'd made clear that if the profits of Pearsons erm er not only if they went down but even if er, there was only a small erm, increase in earnings per share er next year that the the directors' salaries would be very considerably reduced and I thought I'd already made that erm, er, directors' erm remuneration total take home pay would be considerably reduced thought I'd already made that point. Erm on er, Alton Towers which you brought up again er the question is where do you stop? Er, it isn't just Alton Towers, it's whether you should get discounts on Penguin Books it was whether you got, er, bottles of Chateau le Tour erm it, it requests for many different things and, er,you know, alright er, it we could, we could, if Alton Towers seemed to be what, er, all shareholders wanted er, perhaps we, we could consider that but, but, but we do have a number of a attractive products. Erm er your third point was about the balance sheet and I think I'd ask the finance director Yes we, we will give consideration to that of course erm Sorry, can I Apologies. Erm we will, course we will give consideration to erm a further issue which I think is what you were asking us to do. All that does, in effect, as you know is i i is reduce the unit price share price, it has no other effect erm a and I think it's purely cosmetic myself and nowadays I think a share price of around seven hundred P which is, er where the shares are currently hovering, is not e enormously disproportionate but of course we'll keep it under consideration. Erm and your last point was about, erm, er the number of directors and particularly er, outside directors, non-executive directors. Well all I can say is that, erm Sir Simon was being extremely modest when he said that the development of this company er, has been due er, entirely to the executive directors. That that isn't actually the case erm the non-executive directors have been enormously helpful in, er, the field of strategy in giving the executive advice er they play a very full er, role in the develop er m development of the company and erm they also er, keep the er executives, er, in order. Who would sack me? Ch chairman, I wonder if I may just add to that I'm sure you know that the Bank of England the Bank of England have made a very strong point that on balance there should be more non-executive directors than executive directors in the company and, er it is felt very strongly that to get a good mix of non-executive directors really does protect the shareholders' interests and, er I think we're very much following the lead, er, of the Bank of, of England, erm, in this particular respect. And I think that we are very lucky in the very high calibre of non-executive directors we've been able to attract. Name, sir. On Saturday afternoon last What? Your name! Oh sorry. , same as jam! Er, it's very difficult, yes you all laughed when I asked a question last year from over there to get a capital P in Pearson because you all laughed it took twenty weeks to get it in The Times, do you remember? Right. Now we've got a company secretary he is er, an F C I S Chartered Institute Secretaries that's much better than a chartered accountant, they're no damn good as secretaries, right! And the L L B people really they're not up to much, are they? Now this chap is supposed to have constructive commonsense forensic ability, what do we mean,the police? Affability to laugh off his twenty week delay in getting my capital P! Right. Now can we look at his pay cos you all been busy on the directors' pay and this chartered secretary is really important and so that he could be available on a Saturday afternoon if he was wanted. Well now, the problem you say it's emotional shall I say it was blasphemous, it was Rushdie. Now, erm, the situation there was that my vicar came to see me and, erm, what happened was that we've got three churches well luckily, one of them only has about twelve in it another has eighty and another sixty and he said well what did he do about Rushdie? And so well I didn't like what he was doing but at any rate it happened on Sunday morning er, somebody read the lesson and it was Saint, Saint John and there were chapters and of course it was skipping about the verses all over the place, you just got fed up with verses. Right he then went to the pulpit and he said that he was gonna preach about Lazarus actually but he's a quiet fellow and he shouted at the top of his voice I'm speaking about satanic bondage! Er, Mr Yes, is er that blasphemous? er,n what, what, er, er, I think you need to do is ask your question because er Oh right to have a narratable speech is not in order I'm so sorry. yes, yes right. Is erm do we know anything about Rushdie or anything? Another point is, up in Hull in October er, somebody wrote a book about Mahatma Ghandi and he got death threats so the vice chancellor of Hull University he's in Fenners he's a director of J H Fenners in industrial. So I suggest the secretary rings up the secretary of Fenners don't say you're listed in newspapers cos industrial people don't like that but have a word with Fenners and they'll tell you what's gone on. So, what is your question? The question is can a small shareholder do anything for Rushdie, am I doing damage for Pearson? I'm trying Mm. to help Pearson Mm. not pick it to bits over its directors' salaries. Er, well thank you for your offer of help it is, er i i i i it's er er clearly a very difficult issue, there are erm, there are important issues of principle er, in, er conflicting directions it is not an easy one and erm er er er I don't er, really know that there is anything er that, er any shareholder of Pearsons is able to do about it. Thank you. Are there any further questions? Thank you. Well I will now put the resolution to the meeting those in favour would they raise their hands thank you those against there is nobody so I can declare it carried unanimously. Thank you very much. Erm the next matter is the re-election of the retiring directors and a separate resolution is required for each one er I've asked Mr to propose the first resolution. I propose that Mr J H , a director, retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. Right. Thank you Mr . I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against? Thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Mr to propose Sir Simon . I propose that Sir Simon , a director retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. Put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Er Mr I propose that Mr , a director retiring by rotation be and if hereby re-elected a director of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried. Mr . Er, I'd like to propose that Mr J C , a director retiring in accordance with article eighty of the company's Articles of Association be and is hereby re-elected a director of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Erm we now come to the appointment of the auditors and the question of their remuneration. Under the provisions of the Companies Act Nineteen Eighty Five their appointment er, requires the annual approval of the shareholders. I therefore propose that Coopers and Lybrand be and are hereby appointed auditors to the company, to hold office from the conclusion of this meeting until the conclusion of the next meeting er, of the company at which accounts are laid for the company in accordance with section two four one Companies Act Nineteen Eighty Five and that their remuneration for this period be fixed by the directors. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour any against? Thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Well, that concludes the business of the A G M and, er it's now twelve forty and er we can move straight on to deal with the business of the extraordinary general meeting. Erm you already had, er, the opportunity to read my letter of the eighteenth of April er, circulated with the report and accounts, which fully explains the proposals being put forward and which are for firstly increasing the authorized share capital of the company creating two new classes of preference share er, renewing the board's authority to allot shares renewing the board's power to modify preemption rights authorizing the company to purchase its own er, ordinary shares reducing the company's share capital by repaying the existing preference shares er, making certain amendments to the company's employee share schemes increasing the aggregate sum available for directors' fees and authorizing the company to issue summary financial statements. Erm I hope that the, er, circular er pretty fully explains er, these proposals but, er if there are er, questions er, I would be very pleased to answer them. Well, if there aren't any questions er, I would return to the resolutions, er, separately and I would propose the first one which is an ordinary resolution namely it's resolution one, set out in the notice of meeting to increase the authorized share capital of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against? I declare the resolution carried, it's an ordinary resolution. Erm secondly I propose a special resolution, resolution two, set out in the notice of the meeting to create and allot fifty thousand preference shares of U S dollars, a hundred er, each and a hundred billion er, preference shares of one pound each er, I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against? I declare the er, er special resolution er, carried. Erm I propose that ordinary resolution, resolution three set out in the notice of the meeting to grant authority to the board to exercise the powers of the company to allot ordinary shares er, this is an annual er, event I put the resolution to the meeting, those in favour any against? I declare the, er, resolution carried as an ordinary resolution. Erm next I propose as a, er, resolution four which is a special resolution and s set out in the notice of the meeting and is to modify to a limited extent, the obligations relating to the allotment of shares for cash contained in section eighty nine of the Companies Act. Er I put the resolution to the meeting, those in favour any against? I declare the resolution carried as a special resolution. Next resolution five which is an ordinary resolution er, set ou set out in the notice of the meeting which is to authorize the company to make market purchases of the ordinary shares of the company. This again is an annual. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution, er, carried er,as an ordinary resolution. Er resolution six is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting and is to reduce the company's share capital by repaying the five erm hundred and one thousand, three and a half percent cumulative preference shares of one pound, er, each at par. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour S I well I asked for questions before, Mr , but erm what is your question? Why is there a need, sir, to repay the five hundred and one thousand pounds of the three and a half percent cumulative pref shares it's quite a low interest involved. What a low interest share? Well this gives us the ability er, for a tidying up operation but the finance director will give more details. Thank you very much. It's helpful in the context of the dollar preference shares we want to issue because one of the factors of this very small, and as you say cheap er, historic issue of preference shares is that, er no preference shares other than those can be repaid prior to that and the dollar shares we wish to issue which are permanent shares, can be er, can be erm repaid at our option and we do want to keep that flexibility in the context of either if interest rates get very high or if the tax treaty between the U S and the U K changes to make them more onerous on the company and in those circumstances we would be inhibited by the existence of this small historic issue of preference shares and therefore it is on balance, although you're quite right there, a cheap er, source of capital in themselves it is helpful to the company in the wider sense I believe if they are repaid. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against declare the resolution er, carried as a special resolution. Er, next is resolution seven which is an ordinary resolution set out in the notice of the meeting, and it is to authorize the directors to amend the company's employee share schemes in the manner set out in the circular dated eighteenth of April nineteen ninety to members of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried as an ordinary resolution. Erm resolution eight er, set out in the notice of the meeting to increase the aggregate annual sum available for directors' fees to two hundred and fifty thousand pounds I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against I declare the resolution carried as an ordinary re resolution. Erm finally, resolution nine which is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting er, and it's to alter the company's articles to enable the company to issue summary financial statements. I put the resolution to the meeting those in favour any against thank you very much, I declare the resolution carried as a special reso resolution. Erm, that concludes the business of the extraordinary general meeting erm, thank you very much for attending and making it a lively meeting and, erm, my colleagues and I will be pleased to, erm meet you in the foyer er, where refreshments are being served. Thank you very much. long summer break. I just want you to remember the video, someone you don't know is a? Stranger. Right. You don't take sweets you to don't don't take drinks, presents money or Don't take anything. That's right, don't take anything. You don't get in someone's car cos someone you don't know is a? Stranger. What can one say? They know it already Miss. You've been here lots of times too haven't you. You told us before. I know I have, yes I know I have. been here loads of times. And we've watched, and we've watched the video before. Shh shh shh. And we've watched the video before, yes, and we keep learning and we keep coming to tell you don't we? Because it keeps happening, boys and girls in their summer holiday keep get getting taken away by people they don't know and nasty things done to them. So all we want you to do is remember the video remember Pippin yeah? And play safely till you come back to school next term. Play safe and never go with strangers. Strangers. Like James did. never. Like that James did, yes that little boy of three, James did didn't he? Two. Two or three whatever, I've just been Two corrected. Alright. Two. Who's James? Thank you Miss. Thank you. Will you do one thing before you go though class? Will you promise me when you go home tonight you be the teachers and your mum and dad be the children and you tell them all about Stranger Danger and you tell them you're never gonna go with strangers and see what your mum and dad says to you. Yeah, will you do that for me? Yeah. Well done. They don't live with me. Oh I always tell him that. Good man. Thank you very much indeed, thanks for your time. See you later class. Okay,le let's get started! We're, we're going to conclude now the discussion of the various ways in which, bacteria, in particular er lead to the production of infective disease and really to centre round, centres round the discussion of the pathogenesis, that is the mechanism by which the disease is produced and lunanspach. And I hope to run through today, basically, a set of examples of specific infective positions which show particular virulence factors er manifest themselves in terms of clinical disease. We start with er er a fine and exciting topic for Monday morning the topic of boils and in their finalist form they're shown here as starike. But, the sa the very same organisms responsible for that relatively moderate appearance can also produce blocked er region of Prince Charles, the carbuncle with which in it's most er florid form can break down and produce the series, but really effectively interconnecting . If we sample one of these cavities in which the process is er which produce boils er are going on, almost inevitably we find this organism staphylococcusorius and offspotulates have been clearly fulfilled with organism and this disease most notably by a bunch of of medical students who are subjected to all sorts of tortures by their professor of microbiology back in the nineteen fifties. And over the years it's been possible to identify a number of factors produced by these bacteria that seem to make sense in terms of the pathology and the conditions. Now the pathology is by a chief information and i in fact, the chief information could be provoked merely by the presence of organisms. You will, you will recognise from your immunology that the presence is certainly foreign antigenic materials can lead immediately to, to the acute alternatives. But, notable inside er the material that characterises the boils and abscesses, there is a cell death, both of bacteria and of the both the defending cells and the structural cells. And, to a very large extent tri cell death can be related to the ability of staph orius to produce elicit toxins, toxins which actually leave the cell death and . But the characteristic of this puss forming organism is that the legions it produces are wooled off, that is they're relatively localized. And although the er, the causal relationship is not completely established, it is a very helpful way of remembering that one of the principle distinguishing features of this organism which separates it from other members of the genus staphylococcus it pr it produces this enzyme to coagulate things on and the effects of this enzyme are illustrated here as against the control preparation, you see a clot form due to the action of this enzyme on clotting practice which has been put into this test tube serum. So this is almost certain a virulence factor but is also very useful in differentiating pathogenic species of staphylococci from non-pathogenic species. And, as as you'll be hearing in later er stages of the course there are many non-pathogenic species of staphylococci. It's worth also mentioning, since you saw it in the practical class, that staphylococci in general produce this enzyme catalase all of these er lo thi this is the enzyme which breaks down hydrogen peroxide and detoxifies it. All of these factors together lead us an to recognise as it a puss forming organism which is often recognised by the term hyogenic organism, ability to produce puss in er the form of reactions it initiates. Now I want at least, to intro introduce the possibility in the series of diagrams I'm going to show you in this lecture that we can relate it to the four stages of pathogenesis that we, we outline briefly er, in the last lecture. The first stage being the establishment, the next stage being penetration, the third stage being damage, what actually produces the damage in the disease, and the fourth stage is, if the disease is going to last for any period of time the ability of the organism to persist. I'm going to introduce this abbreviated momentictiture here in the hope that during the course of the lecture I'll be able to add comments about which of these factors lead to which of these results. Er, but if we run out of time and I find we haven't we we we can't fit it all in I'd like you all to attempt to do this for yourselves after er, the lecture is over. Okay? So, establishment for staphylococcusorius is often not an important feature because in the majority of infections we're talking about an endogenous infection, the organism was there in the first place. Penetration in many instances is not related to a property of the organism itself, in most instances it's re related to some form of injury in which the organism is moved from it's normal skin location to a deep tissue location. So we won't mention these factors here, although in in some instances er, these properties are important to talk about for staph orius. The damage, is fairly obvious to see is produced by these two and it's worth pointing out that persistence can be related to this catalase enzyme. Staphylococci have some degree of resistance to killing by phagocytes and yo you should recall that phagocytes er, one of the mechanisms by which phagocytes kill intercellular organisms is the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and catalase is one of the ways that these can detoxified and th there's fairly good evidence that the catalase enzyme enables er,staph orius to persist. Okay. So, that's, that's the first example of a very common condition. Let's move on now to consider a very important type of infection such as meningitis. You recognise by particularly common in children not recognised by the particular posture that they adopt and extended neck, rigid neck due to the inflammation of le , lymphees which I will resist being a reflection of the neck, completely rigidly. It's a disease which, if it a , they're fortunate enough to re , recover from the disease, if it's been severe enough the inflammation may have involved er, some of the cranial nerves, and here we can see a third nerve palsy er as a result of er, the process. If you take a sample er, of ce the cera cereblis fluid during the course of acute bacteria meningitis you will find it's drowning, drowning, not due the fact that it's an organism, but present, being due to the presence of puss cells. This is another biogenical fluid and, in about a third of the cases you will find this, very faintly with them Mm mm. which you can just about see here a in conjunction with the puss cells with which it is busily the life and death, life and death tackle. This organism is the fastidious grand negative rod you saw in the erm practical class innocuous influenzi. And it is a a very important pathogen responsible for about a third of the cases of meningitis in in this country almost exclusively in children. Now, the process we recognise in the pa pathogenesis of meningitis due to this organism is as follows, first of all and then it is able, by, mechanisms not completely described but we could probably involve this transpschycosis er phenomenon that er, I I briefly mentioned last time. First of all, penetrates from the into the bloodstream and then into the cerebral spinal fluid. Now the basis for the pathogenesis is not well enough established for us to expect you to understand the details of how it achieves these processes, but one thing which is remarkably clear is that the organism is a capsule producing organism and that once it gets into the er cerebral spinal fluid that predominately is an acute inflammatory . We do recognise establishment factors, that is adhesions in this part of the process and it is very clear that the capsule is one of the factors which allows the organism to pe , persist because it helps the organism to resist phagocytosis. You'll notice that the damage in this instance is actually the result of the acute inflammatory response, not particularly some form of direct noxious effect of the organism, so the contribution of the host is absolutely critical. Now, the reason we we focus on the capsule as illustrated on the right here is that hymophylus have many different capsular types, but but only one type appears to be associated with meningitis. This type B capsule refers to a particular pulse and has it's so important in the pathogenesis of the capsule that antibodies to it can be used er,ca , er can actually completely prevent the disease and we end up with a capsule vaccine based on the type B pulse . Plus, referencing with the other two organisms which produce meningitis in, in humans it is very prominent that both of these, licea meninigitipitus and staphylococcus are also very prominent capsule mechanisms. Hello! That's like the type. H I for hymopholus influenzi. And that's, that H I is actually the th th H, H I B is the acronym for the vaccine. There's a new vaccine introduced last October which is being er, used for the first time in this country to prevent meningitis in children. Is that just the name of the vaccine? H, well H I B is a, an abbreviation for the strain of hymopholus that produces the infection, but the name of the vaccine the H I B vaccine, yeah. Okay? I should say that a, a lot of this information will be covered again during this course, what I'm trying to do now is to bring together the the themes in a pathogenesis of infection that I introduced last week into the practical context of clinical infections. And to to, to try and illustrate to you why we focus on particular virulence factors for particular organisms. Move on now to to look at an area that's er not frequently er doesn't impinge a great deal on life in this country but it certainly does for travellers and for many people in the developing world. This is the topic of secretory diarrhoea produced by infective agents. This is a dramatic disorder of the small intestine which produces a massive outflow of water electrolytes that can be fatal within a matter of hours after the onset of disease! We recognise two agents which are er, responsible in bacterial causes of this process,th there are many others but these are certainly the most important. choleri, the cholera vacilus and er, an acronym here, ETEC, I wouldn't worry about taking down the full er, er , it actually stands for e entrotoxigenic ecolytes, it's a strain or a group of ecolars that are able to produce this effect. These diseases are common in areas er where an out pouring of water from the individual is squared up with a ou , out pouring of people into the water, then you can appreciate that that transmission is very er, readily promoted under those circumstances. The effects on the, the individual are very dramatic! Dehydration, er can produce death within a matter of fe , er a few hours and and an understanding of the mechanism by which this dehydration leads us into one of the most effective forms of heat treatment er, ever produced. A prominent feature of secretory diarrhoea is that effective and normal bowel in,yo you ca , you can ignore this sign are almost indistinguishable, so despite this dramatic change in the physiology of the small bowel, borthalogically it actually looks quite normal. And you have a normal meconium. Now, the organisms that produce this effect haven't, have this target which is around zero for the choleri , the villi of a small intestine and the both of these organisms have pro prominent adhesion mechanisms. Let's just show you something with that. In an affected small bowel you will see the grey background with these tiny little curved rods present the whole area of the er, the villi is covered by the organisms which are er stuck down effectively by the processes which you ca , you can't really see them in the transmission micrograph, but they are attached to specific receptors on the surface of the entrocite membrane. Once they've got there, the organism really goes no further. Both the cholera organism and the ETEC organism secrete toxins referred to here as C T for cholera toxin and LT for the le Lethane toxin. It is very striking that these toxins are actually almost exactly the same molecule! So that although these are er fairly different relatives in terms of bacteria it's striking that the ETEC organism has been able to acquire in some way almost exactly the same gene that's present in choleri. And, this toxin when released from these tightly organisms disorders the er the physiological activity of the lining cells, the empha cells. The molecular oh we've lost a slide! The molecular basis for this is very well understood and forms one of the important themes in er the effects of e , exotoxin in human cells. This toxin is composed of two components er, of binding components and active component. Binding component binds to specific receptors on the emphacyte and the active component penetrates into the cell and inactivates the controlling mechanism on the production of . And this is the cell that er, is possessed by several other toxins that affect, not just the gut but other parts of the body as well. I should point out that in one of the features of adhesions is that it takes two to tango, so to speak! Where specific adhesions are involved the the , the structures that are, are most commonly associated with a , require a specific receptor for the adhesion reaction to take perfect. Did she make it herself? She did. Goodness. It was our Christmas present wasn't it? I forget what it was, was it her present? Mm. Well has it been nice not having to go to France? Mm. Except of having to go to London instead. Mm I couldn't tell how many people would agree with you about that one that London could be at least a bit preferable to Paris. Well Helen's a bit like you she, she sort of perks up when she starts to smell the petrol fumes Mm! Ya. And she said she had a lovely time. She went to an exhibition, she went for a browsing sort of shop. She said the shops were empty. Mm. Shopping is much more comfortable now. Mm. I'd better go and try and do some some time. Mm. There's a lovely suit in at the moment in the sale in what's that place called? ? Near Mhm. it's really lovely. Smart, one could go to town or anywhere in it. Mm. Why is it you don't buy it then? Well because it's darkish in colour and I'd rather promised myself that if I have anything new now it'll be of a brighter colour. Oh well go and buy the thing before somebody else does, go up this afternoon. Dearest I'm saying it's a dark colour. Yes. Yeah but you could wear it with, you could wear bright things with it. Mm. Shush, don't push me, I don't need pushing. No no really I, I, I've resolved, it's charcoal grey you see It sounds very smart Enid. Very smart. We're going to have Princess Diana. My size too. Is it? Mm. It's got your name written on it. Mm. Why don't you go up and buy the thing? No. I'll phone her and ask her if she's got it in red. You can pinch a bit more of my er Like the telephone woman. Mm? Like the telephone woman. Oh er isn't she oh isn't she super? I don't like the advertisements they're doing for the telephone now though. Which are they? Oh they have this silly man who picks up the telephone in a he's er got a chef's hat on and he says Giovanni's and then it was, it turns out to be one of his old friends so he lapses into sort of Glaswegian. Oh no! I haven't heard that one. Oh but Maureen erm er what's she called? Maureen Lipman, yes Lipman, Lipman. is very good on those isn't she? Mm. She's the right sort. Erm the thing that I feel I couldn't go to see her in is erm Hello Joyce. Yes, that Joyce Grenfell thing? Mm. A bit of it was on the television. Yes, I saw that bit and it wasn't good No. because sh Joyce Grenfell was such a lady, it came through. And and wh and er Maureen Lipman is much more earthy Mm. and that came through and it was no good. If you've seen Joyce Grenfell you, you couldn't Funny thing to put No. a Jewess to to try to represent Joyce Grenfell anyhow isn't it? Yes. Yes in a way, except she well you could do, it could be done. Did you feel that about her on television? Well I felt, I just didn't know what it was but it lacked the sort of charm that it had before. Mm. Completely. Almost thought when she, when it was when it was erm er mentioned in the first place that she was going to do it Mhm. I almost thought ooh you know I'd love to write and say oh don't, don't. Joyce Grenfell was such a lady. You couldn't say that to her cos she didn't it would be insulting but in fact, that's the big difference. Mm. Talking of things like this, you know er some people have postcards with their name on in black, across the top Oh yes they do. Yes that's right, they do. Mm. Well er all sorts of funny people like have them like erm Iris has, has them. Oh does she? And does Jane . Yes. Yes she has them Mm. my aunt has them, my father used to have them. Mm. and so I've always associated them with sort of erm, you know, what people had before all those sticky labels came Mm yes. People who did things properly? Mm. Mm. Well when I was in the London office one chap who is an east end Jew made good, his name is Ralph , erm suddenly gasped and said gosh isn't this wonderful? So I sort of was called to look at it, and I said oh yes, all the people I know who have got those are over seventy. And was it one of his own? No no, someone had sent it to him. Somebody had sent to him. And he, he thought that it was such a touch of class about it. Mm. Mm. And I expect he's gone away to get them printed now Oh probably. because I s I said, I said How funny . I said well they're just what people had before the sticky labels. Yes. And he dragged out his sticky labels which, which had got blue stripes on them No? Yes, I thought No that wasn't terribly elegant but anyway his blue labels had got, these little sticky labels had got blue stripes on them top and bottom. Oh how funny. Erm and so I guess he's gone away to get some made. Mm And I said and of course to do it really properly, you also have envelopes so that if you want to you can stick, stick the card in an envelope that will Yes. fit it. Cos that's what we used to have. Mm. Oh yes it wouldn't go naked through the post would it? Well you can yes you can't Mm you know, you could use it for quick notes Mm. to drop on people's doorsteps Yes. or, or Which is useful. Yes. Or if you just want to sort of signify a, a quick thank you to someone. Mm yes. Or a quick come Yes I hadn't thought about that. Mm mm they're they are very useful, I've often thought of having some made Mm. because, in fact every time I get one from someone else I always think why haven't I gone and got some of those yet? I know why, because you're not seventy. That's right, give me another twenty years. We had those envelopes er and the cards for our concerts. Well they were probably erm invitation to a concert. Yeah but they were all fixed up to go into the same envelope sort of thing. Mm. Yes Oh yes you can't , can't use them though. No. Got too much detail of where we lived and erm you know that it was a concert. But but these you know, you had your telephone number and you know, just had a whole statement of everything about you. Mm mm. And And all you needed was the brief message that you had to send. Yes. And it saved you hav it saved you having to do the preliminary thing of saying dear whoever you are Of course, that's right. That's right. which was sometimes quite a difficult thing to do. Well on a personal card you're not supposed to put dear anybody are you so I know but that does make it difficult. No it made it very easy. You know, especially when perhaps you were having a mixed sort of meeting Mm. wh I remember that when I was at home it was a mixed sort of meeting in which some of the people from the village were coming who you didn't really know but they had to be asked Mm. Mm. Yes. well you I mean you, you could cover er cover the whole thing couldn't you? Mm mm. Without saying dear so and so. Yes. Mm. And without really having to sign it. You could just put your initial in the corner. Of course. Mm that's right it Are they called gentle Yes cards? Something like that, yes . safe distance cards. I must go and get some made. indeed. Oh gosh. Have you used any of these erm things called Post It? Oh yes they, they use them a lot at work. Th but they're useful? What are they? Well er they're er like your autumn leaves that you used to leave on everybody's benches Oh did I? erm but they've got a sticky bit on them Oh I know, yes. and so you, you'd have stuck it on the bench you see erm and it comes off anything without making a mark on Oh yes we've got a little pack of them in London I think on the, by the telephone. Yes. That's right, some teeny weeny ones? Yes. Mm Folly gave them to you? They they they used to call them my autumn leaves er erm Patsy and more Oh have some more an another piece of ham, do have some more ham or you're getting some nice cheese in a minute. Oh cheese. are we having some cheese? Mm. Well I think I'll wait for some cheese Mm. Ye yes I used to leave notes I'm I'm tr I'm tr I'm trying not to overeat you see? Yes. Right. Please yourself. I'm trying to avoid being noticed if I overeat. You're trying to, you're trying to avoid being starved all the time aren't you darling? You're allowed to have some water aren't you ? No no no no no It's difficult for you but he's trying to avoid being starved. Will that plate do? It'll be fine. dish you out a larger one. No no it will be absolutely fine, thank you. Okay. Well help yourself, I can recommend cheese. Well autumn leave is the best way out of, of of er communicating. If I were to turn to a man on a bench Mm. and say to him so and so and so and so he'd always answer back and say I want to do it this way Mhm. and er the time was wasted, but you give an autumn leaf a little note saying what it, what you, what you wanted done there wasn't much chance he could argue. Yes I heard a very interesting conversation on the way down here in that programme Just a Minute Oh you know the one I mean? I hate it but I'll tell you why in a minute. Mm mm. Go on. Well I don't like it very much but it has this very interesting discussion as to whether a fax was cheaper or more expensive than the telephone Mm? and the biggest pro for a fax that I can think of is that you can send the message and that's that, there's no risk of it dribbling on into, into doubt Mm As it would on the telephone, yes. Yes. How right. Mm. So I thought that was quite interesting to think Mm and they can't argue with a fax. think about. I hate that programme because I like I tend to come and listen to the content of what they're saying Mm. and they're only saying it for the sake of keeping going. Yes And then er so it's never, it's never worth serious attention is it? Well just occasionally it is. Sometimes you do get something interesting. And and and and then and then they get interrupted and you wish, you know, you wish they hadn't. That's it, you see that's full of frustration Yes it's for me I don't like it, I, I prefer things like the news quiz Mm. or even that one about that game with Mornington Crescent in it. Mornington Crescent? Yes. I've heard that phrase used but I don't know what it's for. Oh well it's, it's where they say say a sequence of underground station names or or locations Oh in London in, in a sort of clever way that makes it sound as though there's some terrific good reasoning for it Oh. and they just say it totally randomly and the last one just the first pers person who says Mornington Crescent is the winner but they've made a great big sort of fiction as to how why, when it is suitable to say Mornington Crescent You have to come to it Yes. I, yes I see. Th there's no logic to it at all but they play it on. How extraordinary, I've not heard that one. Mhm. It's a programme where they also sing the songs of one tune wh to another tune. Oh you mean the programme where they do that? Mm. Erm well that's not that's not My Music is it? No. No. Erm That's erm can't remember what it's called. Mm it's Jazz With Humphrey Littleton. Oh. I, I'm, I'm not with you on that one because erm I'm sure I'm vaguely at the back of my mind I think I know what it is, I have heard of it I mean Mm. or heard it Mm. but I can't bring it to mind, it won't come to the front as it were. Well I can't remember what it's called. Erm yes apart from My Music I can't think of one. I heard a very amusing thing on the radio this morning Mm? came in half way through it, at least half way erm but it was so obviously the voice of erm Freud, Clement Freud Mm. talking and he was telling about a visit he had paid to China for a whole week Mm. and how he'd seen prison and er they'd said they hadn't any prisons but he found one and erm hospitals and all that sort of thing and at the end of the week's visit erm one of the very high ups, whom he named and I've forgotten the name of him, I think I'll just use that, thank you erm sent for h he, he was brought before him as it were and the man said to him are there any questions er at the end of your week that you want to ask and he said well perhaps there is one he said erm Winston Churchill was here erm a month or two, a few months ago Mm. and he also, he like me stayed in the and he named the hotel in Mm. Peking he said can you tell me why his room was larger than mine Mm. and his room had three windows erm and I, mine only had two Mm. he said in spite of the fact that I've been in parliament for longer than he has, which surprised me cos I wouldn't have thought so this is the young Winston Churchill of course so the Chinese man said to him erm oh well the reason for that was that he had a famous grandfather and so Clement Freud said, not to him but now on this programme this morning, that's the first time I've ever been de-grandfathered That was rather nice wasn't it? Presumably his grandfather was Sigmund Freud was it? Yes. Mm. The Chinese didn't know. No I shouldn't think the Chinese have got much time for that sort of approach to life. I don't think they have either. I don't think they'd have been impressed even if he'd told them No. Erm did you see that th they're, they're going to look for some sort of gene called the Churchill factor? No. Well they want to find out why it is that someone who smoked so much and drank so much Mm! had to live so long. Yes. Well it's obvious. It's the same sort of factor that allows anybody who smokes a lot to not get cancer and not get bronchitis and live, also live a long time. There are plenty of them. Well that's true. I it's just a question of, you know, something in your make-up that is inoculating you and other people have a weakness. Well that's right. Other people go down with it. You can't really I should think find a gene surely that's There must be something though Enid. Mm there must be. His father was a very weak man wasn't he? Yes. His mother was a character but She was not nice. Not nice but she had a strong character. Mm. But his This reminds me Mm? might I just say this darling cos I've just remembered, I'll forget senile you see? Erm we have a video of the last programme of the Churchill series Mm? erm which a friend in London very kindly made for us because we were out with her, her mother Mm. and couldn't see it Mm. and erm Joan's video has gone wrong in some way Really? Yes, she doesn't know how to work it to begin with but she was working she was working on that, of course we don't know a thing about it, erm and the make, the erm the handyman chap came along and took a part away, it was faulty Mm. so we can't see it. Do you want to come and see it on mine? I was going, I'm getting round to that you see aren't I? Mhm. Erm we feel rather badly about not returning it to this person who made it for us Mm? because it's now a fortnight since we had it I think Mm. Well come and see it on mine. May we do that? Mm, sure. But when, that's not going to disturb you? Don't know. Erm let's think. Tomorrow morning? No. I'm taking, I'm going to London tomorrow afternoon, I Afternoon. I, no I've only just thought of it, I'd take it with me if, if we'd seen it. Mm. I've got to go out this evening. Yes. Well tomorrow, what happens to you tomorrow? Is it your lazy day when you Yes. Mm well we won't see it tom we'll keep it another week keep it another week I'll get my diary. I'll get my diary, can't talk without a diary. Okay. We can't do it next Saturday because erm we've got two people, a Scotsman married to a Chinese Yes. coming to spend Saturday. Mm. So that's a dead day for next week. And might be able to do it before the weekend perhaps Yeah think so, I'm just when does Noel get back from London? Erm hoping Monday evening. He's going to see Mr . He has a little bit of a scratchiness in one of his eyes Mm? erm and phoned up and sort of semi made an appointment, not exactly Mhm. erm because Mr was abroad and the girl said well I mean come in on Monday, when he'll be back Mm. and he may be able to see you then. Yeah. So come Monday morning, Sunday night in fact, Noel said gosh I can this is, this seems to have gone light. We've got some ointment from the doctor which didn't work last time he put it out Mm. and seems to have worked this time. So he said I can't go along and bother a busy man when it's feeling much better. Mm. So erm he didn't go Mm. but he got a phone call on the Tuesday from Mr 's secretary to say oh Mr would like to see you anyway because er he feels it may have erm it was a letter, I'm sorry, which came Mm. in case it has any bearing on any difficulty you might have in the future so he's to go down So he's got an appointment? Mm Monday morning. And then he's going to call at Sotherby's. Do you know Sotherby's are the most dilettante people you've ever come across, they really are. Mm. With the exception of the one erm section leader that he deals with normally. At the beginning of this week a girl phoned up and said that erm the chap he normally deals with is away Mm. but there's an organ is Sussex they want him to look at and erm so he said well send me a photograph er they've got a photograph of it you see Mm. send the photograph and that gives me an idea whether it's worth going to look at it at all. That I think was about Tuesday. Mhm. It never came. This is what they do, they phone up asking They could have they could have even faxed it. Mm well we haven't got a fax. Oh no. But the thing is, what they do tend to do is, they suddenly find themselves in a panic because they've behaved like this about it and the person at the other end is shouting when are you coming to see this organ Mm. I was talking about how dilatory S er Sotherby's are. Oh. Yes but I know the thing dear no Well of course they're not, they're not in a businesslike business are they? No not really, no. And I wonder if it seems to be that they prefer you come out of the upper drawer than come up with your brilliant A levels or whatever. They do, yes. Mm. Exactly that. Mm. They are erm a very, you know one, one of the last bastions where those sort of people can find a refuge. Yes. I suppose so. I find them You know,l like, like the Duke of Kent's daughter. Mm. Does she work there? She works in art galleries or, or some art gallery Or some art gallery. Yeah. Mm. And the man she's marrying is an art gallery. So he is. That's right. So he is. there has to be space for these people though somehow I always feel that they cream it all the same. Mm I think they do cream it, yes. Oh that's Well du during next week is what we think Noel. Pardon? During next week erm I'm just trying to think, I've got very heavy days on Monday and Tuesday so Wednesday's a possibility then in that case. Er let's shall, can we leave it open? Mhm, certainly. And then we'll arrange it with you, mm? Yes. Erm I don't know whether I think post rather erm er I see I'm not going to London after erm after this week Ooh. Oh you're going to be making some of your special coffee are you love? I am indeed. Ooh er How's your barn proceeding? Don't know, it doesn't seem to be doing anything and what the was that during the week when was in residence one night the dogs barked and he went out to see what was happening and there was a young man who worked in it this was in the pitch dark, was up there taking some of his stuff away. Oh. Oh. So I wonder. Has he run out of cash? Well, I wouldn't be surprised. Why would he need to do it in the dark? Well if for instance it's approaching receivership Oh oh oh you'd want to sort of, you know Mm. Oh yes. get your stuff and you'd want it not to be obvious that you'd got your stuff. Oh I see, yes. But that's, that's only a guess though I don't know. you mean the young man who actually owns it or the man who's employed working on it? Well I don't know who exactly owns it Yes. but the man who has been doing the work there who said he owned it Oh I know, oh. But the, the lady who was erm what's her name daughter, she used to live in the erm erm live in the terraced house erm What Jo ? Mrs what? you mean? No er the people before them. The ? What? The ? yes, Ann 's daughter Mhm. who's got the farm up at Mhm. and there's a there's a farm for sale opposite there, you never saw such a wreck in all your life. Oh it is a wreck. Yes. Yes it really is. Yes. I think the vogue is dying isn't it? Yes. Erm they're being much stricter about what you can do to them. Erm. And how you do it perhaps. And how you do it and everything, yes. I think that erm across the road from me he's just mucked around. Yes. He hasn't done things in the sort of, you know, the preferred way. That was the sign from the beginning wasn't it? Yes. And he hasn't had building inspections at the right sorts of times. Ah. So I think he's going to find himself in a lot of trouble. That's good. Mm. Well he didn't, he did deserve it didn't he, really? Yep. But he paid dearly for it in the first place didn't he? I think it's such a shame that he's gone and put that wretched wirenetting fence so close to the road I agree. across the road from me. That what? Wirenetting fence across the road. Yes it is wretched. Cos it's so close to the road, it doesn't give me any swinging round room Well actually if he's on my side of the road. If he's having problems Mm? you may be able to get that rectified mayn't you? Ya. And say yes Better arrange for the coal lorr lorry to back in to it one day. Ya I was I've been thinking of trying to have a big delivery of something. I mean I would do you er have ? I don't have any coal delivered unfortunately. Oh. I've go I've got some coal in the coal shed and it, you know,i it sort of lasts me. Oh. I never seem to run out. Because if you had old er what's his name? Don . Don , 's man er if you explained the bother Mhm. er he would back his with a little encouragement from me he'd back his lorry right into it and flatten it for you. Darling he's a very nice man. I know he is, that's why he'd do it. Well unfortunately if, if I did have a delivery of coal it would come in through the other entrance. Oh that needn't prevent you from backing in er backing into it when he turns round. No it's been, it's been a tough week this last week. Oh dear. I'm sorry. I feel very sorry for people who have to work for their living now, I really do. Mm. Yes. Oh we've got something else have we? I thought Yes we've got a little bit of Israel haven't you? A bit of Israel? Yes. We had a box of oranges sent to us from Israel Oh I see direct to me Mm. friends of ours there. Actually it's George 's son. Mhm. My wife's Hello Ian, oh I was hoping that you'd come and see us. Yes. That's wonderful. to see you. I'm just getting, will you tea? Yes, I'd love one. Thank you. Right I'll just get that. Well how are things going? Yes business okay Mm no No? Oh dear dear dear not at all, no. Is old alright? Just about yes yes. That must be worrying, a lot of people feel like that don't they? Yes. No it's, it's been a very bad eighteen months er Oh dear. cos the, the business that I was What? the business I was a director of Yes? er last year went into receivership Oh lord. in January Ooh. Now does that have a er I, I know you lose the income but does it, does it penalize you at all? Yes it does. Oh dear. Yes. Yeah we've had er the D T I investigating Oh lord. cos it was quite a big company. Oh. But erm it just er hopefully because yeah but really they're just trying to investigate to make sure that we didn't act fraudulently in any way. Oh yes. Oh good. I mean I don't suppose Which, which we didn't. You know it was the it was the downturn that erm Yes, ooh you know that started nineteen nineteen ninety one. What was the business what er did you do? In, in advertising. Advertising oh yes. An advertising agency. Oh. Yeah. But about a third of the top agencies in our sector all went bust in Good god. in the last eighteen months. Cos living up here privately in retirement one doesn't realize these things. I mean er unemployment in er white collar management area is, is, is very marked now. Is it? Yeah it's yes. Yes it's really affect affected our, our businesses. There's so many areas that have contracted so much. Yes and i it's a, it's long erm It is, yes. process Yes. Affects everything. But, you know, things are going okay. But you, you managing just, just to hold on Just about yes. Yeah. Cos as you know Ben's in Hong Kong Yes?yes. He's suddenly swapping from the police to er security in a big bank. Oh fascinating. Oh. Erm I, I suppose it'll be a couple of years before he does that but Well, yes. yes. Cos he signed up for five, five years didn't he? He signed up for three years with an option Mm to do another two. Oh I see, yes. And I think he's going to work out the other two and then go on to this forget the name of it at the moment, this bank Mm. and er but he doesn't want to come back to England. No I was sorry I missed him when he came over last year. Last year, yes. I just had a quick phonecall with him. Oh he did speak to you? Yes. Yes that's right mm Yes. Yes see that time went like lightning. Yes. Such a shame. Edmund is still in his job. Aha. He still hasn't got naturalization but he seems to be fairly erm fairly secure. He's a journalist of course. Yes. Is he confident that he'll get the naturalization? Oh yes, eventually he will. Right. Yes. W will that be this year or does it take much longer? You can never tell Really? never tell, a girl we know went over at the same time as he did got it this year. Really? But er it's just the luck of the draw, it all depends upon the temper of the particular official that's handling it I think. Yes. I'll give you a funny article he wrote before you go. Oh I'd like to see that. But er I'm just trying to think now er Ben er the trouble with it is, Edmund can't leave the country whilst he's in a job until he gets naturalization because he's got to get a work permit and an entry permit and everything all the way through Right. and again er with the present state of unemployment in America it's unlikely he would get it. It's very difficult. Yes. But he, he managed to get his extension to his permit because he had these English connections and the paper he was on reckoned that he was very valuable to them and so they Good. they held him. Good. Well I'm sure he's Are your wife and family well? Yes. They're happy with you are they? Yes they are, yes. I wouldn't er bestow them er on you even for a short visit though. Oh don't be silly. The er the s the small one is er Oh you've got two have you? Yes he's a real handful. Is he? Oh dear dear Yes. dear dear. Yeah he's er he's nearly two and it's a er they're trying times. I've had it five times. Yes. We're expecting another one in June. Are you really? You That'll be that'll be the third. But I had five. Every Yes. one I said was the last but it . Oh I see certainly feel that er we must be mad. We must be mad. And you're living in Chiswick? Yes, yes. Although we'll have to sell that house. Would you? What because of the financial position? Yes. Oh dear oh dear So er we'll have to wait we're, we're er we've put an offer in, in on a house in Weybridge Oh yes? in Surrey. Erm not particularly because we, we wanted to go to Weybridge but er Cos travelling's expensive isn't it? It is actually. Fifteen hundred pounds for twenty five minutes' journey to Waterloo. But it's got a huge garden which with the two boys I think will be marvellous. Oh yes. It's very unusual for a even in a, a suburban er Yes. area. Huge garden. I know Weybridge slightly. Do you? Oh. Mm. Erm but will you make, be able to make much profit on the on your old Chiswick house to be able to buy the Weybridge one, will that be an economic move? Erm we save quite a lot er which is what we're trying to do, yes. Oh good, yes. Erm and it's er it's a good area for schools It is a good area for schools, mm. a a and er it's you know a reasonable community As a matter of fact I knew an old couple that ran a, had a nursery school there, a big one and a very successful one. Yes I imagine it, it would be. For a number of years they did have but er It's a shame about le leaving Hounslow where Chiswick is Yes. because they provide nursery places. And Yes. so Thomas who's three is at school. Oh yes. Whereas Surrey doesn't until they're five. Oh dear. So we'll have to put them Even if they don't you can sometimes find that if you get behind the scenes that there is a way of doing it. Yes. Yes. Got to spin a hard luck story, something of that sort. Yeah. Yes. But erm we're very lucky where we are. The state schools are very good. Are they, in Chiswick? They do seem very good. Very pleased with them. But erm it's difficult living in London now. The erm you really are aware, I don't know if you get up to London much? Do occasionally, yes. Yes but the erm the atmosphere Oh I hate London, it's awful. Chris Christmas day I had a real chest erm and mouth and everything. I can quite believe it. And it's erm it's so oppressive and we really worry about it with the children. Yes well I can see that, mm. I er I very much dislike London. We've got, still got a little house there Yes. and er so it gets sort of At the organ works? Yes. Yeah. It's a bolt hole Mhm. but I very seldom use it. Yes. How, how's the er organ business going? They're up to their eyes in work. Plenty of Really? of work. Mm. Good. Lot of it export. Good. Ian do you have milk in your tea? Just milk, that'll be Just lovely. yes right. Yes. No sugar? No thank you. Oh good lad. Oh yes John s came back from Japan Really? They, he built a large organ university of or Yes, yes. And er he was back there ten days ago for some or other to see another customer and when he came, only got back into the country on Monday or Tuesday Aha. beginning of this week and then today I've had a letter from an architect friend in America suggesting he gets in touch with an architect in for another job Yes, yes. I'm taking it down to him tomorrow. But he's he's got work in there to come. He's going to build a new organ for Chelmsford cathedral. Oh that's good A new one for St John's College Cambridge, he's really quite busy. Good. Good well I'm pleased that er business is strong. Oh yes he's alright. Yes. Well Ian and how are you doing? Oh not too bad. Keeping fit Really? anyway. Yes. You're keeping fit? That's good. He said he didn't bring the children because he thought that we were too old for them. I think we're, I'm too old for my children, well the smallest one. How lovely. Harry is a a nightmare. He's a real Is he? handful. Yes. He's a handful is he? Oh dear. I'm just going to pour you a Right. I w I was letting it Thank you. er brew a little bit just to Yes that's fine for you. You're looking very fit anyway. Oh that's kind of you. Well we keep busy don't we darling? Ya. And erm we just love it here of course Mm. so we've got nothing to grumble about at all really. Ian was saying how Good. he's moving out of London t to Weybridge or hoping to. Hoping to. You are? Yes. Oh are you? Yeah. That'll be nice. I, I think so. Yes. It's not it's not out of choice entirely because er the business that I was has, has gone very very badly over the last eighteen months Do you mean that type of business or that particular firm? Both. Oh. Yeah. But the particular firm I was a director of went into receivership Oh dear. beginning of last year, it was about Oh that's a year ago now and erm so er I mean fortunately it was bought er as a going concern Good. erm but everyone's financial position er suffered as a result. Yes. Mm. So I'm not as, on as good a contract. You're not? No. No. But them I'm lucky to have have a job really. Well I mean these were the kind of jobs that weren't replaceable weren't they really? Well In a slump. yes that's it. I mean there's so little business around that erm That's right. so It was, it was somewhat a good thing that somebody was prepared to buy it. Yeah. Now I'll pull this forward a bit erm Ian Sorry is this your seat? and no it isn't, no no no, not at all. Now I'm going to leave those there Yes. Alright and you'll just dive in to those won't you? Oh lovely thank you. That's the thing. I'm going to sit quite near to you because I can hear better when I do. Right. So. Erm so this means that the house that you were so er happy with and have you continued to be happy with it? Yes. Erm in er forgotten In Chiswick. In Chiswick Yes. that's right. Aha. So you've got to leave that now? Yes. Yes. Mm But Well this is life when you're young. i i it is really. Yeah I mean we we're fatalistic about it, it's I, I think it is only a, a phase. Yes. Things will change. Yes. I'm sure we've learnt er I've learnt er business er er secures as a result of it Yes. erm so positive about it. Yes. It's the only way to be really isn't it? Well yeah yes. Have you got a house ready for you in erm Weybridge? Well we're buying it from an ol elderly chap Mm. erm he's been in it twenty years and er he's had it on the market for some time. It m probably not as long as a year but it's quite a while Mm. er and he's accepted our offer Good. but he doesn't seem actually willing to move out Oh er which I can understand really. You, one gets very fond of a house really. I think he's he's split up with his wife Oh. although he must be sixty odd erm and it's obviously a very difficult time for him. Yes. Erm so he's keeping us in limbo really Yes. which is a bit infuriating cos er Alison's due our third in My! at the end of June Oh. so er we have to be decided either way yes. by then. Yes. Oh we're quite happy to rent for a while. I was going to say that's the alternative I suppose Yes, yes to, yes. yes And you might even have to do this er for an interim period or something Yes until he decides Can you get yes. places to rent alright? Yes you can actually, yes. Yes. Mm yes, do help yourself Ian. Erm so where would he be meaning to go if he does let you He wants to move down to a smaller house in Weybridge. Yes. Er which we're told shouldn't be difficult to find. Er no no. So erm, you know, hopefully that will be the case. Mm. But erm I don't think he er realizes how difficult it is No. to set up No. a move and that really he's quite fortunate to have a buyer somewhere within the price he wanted. Indeed. Cos we've all you know, we've all not got as much for our houses as we want No that's very true. That's true. Mm. Oh well let's hope that he will. I mean the thing is at the age of sixty he has no conception of what it's like to be your age at this period. Mm. Well, you know, he hasn't bought a hou sold a house within the last ten years Mhm mm which we've done a number of times Yes. and it's not a pleasant it's a very stressful business. I'm sure I'm sure it is. I don't know how we escaped it so much but we have you see. Because we lived on the business, that was Mm. er a foregone conclusion and we never sought to move from there until he retired did we? Mm. No. So one doesn't know er exactly what it's like to do it. No. No. Mm. Gosh. And tell us about the children, how old are they? Harry is erm he'll be two in June Mhm. then Thomas will be four in August. Oh I see, so they're nice spaces. Yes there'll be two years between all of them. Yes. Yes. So which Alison feels is erm er you know the right sort of time Ideal really. for her Yes. which is obviously important. Yes. And erm they haven't had Thomas doesn't remember not having Harry around That's nice. whereas we've got friends who've got older children well a little bit there's, yeah, three or four years between Mm. and they get er old enough to be er quite er happy that they're on you know,c centre of attention Exactly. which er Thomas hasn't. It sours the relationship a bit. Yeah it does a bit. Yes aha. Mm. Ah well I I is this going to be, if it's a boy is this going to be a Benjamin? I don't know actually. could be. you've got two boys Mhm. and so the last of the tribe. Oh the last of the tribe. Yes. Well I think I think you know what I mean. Mm. Erm that's what we did finally in desperation with Ben wasn't it? You decided to He was five, number five . Erm it would be nice to have a little girl then now wouldn't it Mm really? I'd, it's funny because I always wanted a girl Mm. but now I, I wouldn't know, I don't feel I'd know what to do Mm well this is just how Ruth was. Yes got no choice. Mm. No that's right. This is what Ruth er felt cos she had two boys Mm. but erm and she thought I shan't know how to deal with a girl at all Mhm. which is a funny thing for a woman to think isn't it? Well Alison feels the same, yes Does she? Yes, yes she does. Yeah. It is odd isn't it? But And then she had Oh, oh she adores her, and of course she said it's wonderful, I don't have to keep struggling to get boys out of their trousers. Yes. This of course is passing now because the girl's Yes. four isn't she Noel? Four and Really? Gosh she'll be five in April and that's the youngest one. Oh. And er, oh here they are Mm. and er she said it was lovely to be able to put her in dresses. Mm. That's the first day at school Oh lovely. for Catherine. Mhm. She, they all go to the same school. Oh lovely. That's nice isn't it? children, yes it's great. Mm. So Ruth I think as far as, barring accidents, will regard that as being her final Right. They live in Wells Oh do they? in Somerset. Mm. Yes. Oh lovely. I don't know that area but And they no they're very happy there . So that's them. And I gather John's doing well. Yes John is doing well, he's got three children too. He's ooh Yes and his are lots the other way round Aha. erm a boy first and then two girls. Well he's got three too. Nice kids. Yes. Mm yes nice kids. Mm. And of course Margaret's not erm inclined for marriage, she loves her job. No, yeah. And erm I think she'll be she'll, she'll probably stay single unless Mhm she meets some nice old man. Yeah. Wh and where's Margaret working? She's now at erm one of the girls public day school trust schools in Sydenham. Oh. Sydenham High School. Mm. Sydenham High School For Girls. Her dream really is to be teaching at City of London School Mm. And erm I'm ho we're hoping that she might Mm. get a job there. But she loves her work doesn't she Noel? Very secure. And she And your mother seems keeping quite well. Yes, yes she is. She had a bad er flu over Christmas when she was due to come and she's still got a very bad chest Mm. Oh I'm sorry to hear that, oh. but er That's the bit that hangs on always Yes. isn't it? Mm. Yes I saw her, I went up to I went to keep fit with her Oh you did? Good. and er Good. although I didn't last Tuesday, I did the Tuesday before and she seemed Mhm to be getting back on her feet alright. Mm. Ah She says she's much better Mm. And what about Hamish? Mhm. Doing fine? Mm. Finding it quite difficult to get work but erm he was over at Christmas for a short time. Oh yes. I don't think And I saw him we saw him did we? No. Well he wasn't here very long No. but er they've got, they've se set up their own teaching business Oh, have they? and again because of the recession over there le learning English is, is one of the things that, you know, gets put, put back on the It's not a priority. priority yes. Mm. Mm. So erm but they se they seem to be working out okay. Mm. They've taken somebody else on so things can't be that bad Have they? Yeah. Oh good. Mhm. er Alec is a re another real handful. Is he? He's a year younger than Thomas but he was the same height Mm. and er sort of wild curly hair and Oh really? Yes. real wild Isn't that funny? but lovely, lovely boy yeah. Yes, yes but, but lively. Yes. Mm. Very much so. Is that the only child they have at the present time? Yes. Yes. Mhm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. All they can cope with I think. And of course he'll be bilingual. Well he is. Mm. He's quite slow as a result, which is quite common apparently Is it? with er children who are brought up with both languages. Mm. Mm. Erm bec they don't speak either very well to start off with. And how old is he did you say? He's two and a half Oh well it's early. It's such an advantage to them later on I think. Oh well a absolutely yes. Mm. Er he because Toni, Hamish's wife Mm is half French so Is she? I'm, I'm sure he'll her pick up Get three. Trilingual. Yes. Cos they spend quite a lot of time, they spend their holidays in France. Yes. So I'm sure that confuses him even more at this stage. Mm. Course it does. Yeah. Yes but in the end it does seem to work. I was always a bit doubtful about it Mm. erm er you know, whether it could vu confuse children or not but in fact it doesn't seem to with John's children does it? No no. His They use his wife is German. Yes. Yes. Mhm. And they use both languages quite freely. Mm. In fact she gets rather uptight because erm during the year at school when they're speaking English most of the time Yes. which is very natural, and so she ships them off to Germany to the relatives To put them straight. Aye That's quite right I think because it is a good, good thing. That's right. Well it is. I wo I won't thanks. Will you have another one? No thank you. Well help yourself then if you want one. Mm. But Yes. of course the, the, the slump is also, not the slump, the recession is also er operative in Italy is it? Yes. It's everywhere. Ian why do people It's worldwide. Well make such a fuss about it erm I mean politically? Well, yes well I suppose it's Everybody's having to cope with it. coming up to an election time and Of course. everyone er They're bound to use it. bound to use anything they can Mm. er any angle they can get, get a grip of. Yes. But er yes, no it is th I mean they had a lot of business from banks and areas like that Yes. which of course have lost a lot of money in the last year or two. That's right of course. They have, they will be drawing back on most things. Yeah. But in fact they're the people aren't they who need bilingual people on the staff? Yes they are. They're much, much better. I mean y er you know, although they're in recession I, I think there's you know in this country Mm. we we're owned now, our company, by a French agency group and erm none of our directors are, are learning French. Isn't it extraordinary. And yet you've got people who run restaurants, small businesses of that sort erm just general businessmen who want, you know, know they have to speak English. Mm. And they're just doing it as a matter of course over there. Yes. They all seem to have more drive than our people, what's the matter with us? It's certainly in the, in that area, it's the cosmopolitan business Mm. attitude er and also it's complacency because we can Yes. you can get away with it. You know all the meetings That's right. are held in English. Mm. Mm. And er the French speak very good English Mm. erm so there's, there's not enough incentive there. No. And I have to say that er I don't. But I, I, I I ou really I, I know I'll have to be thrown into the situation of having to do it You'd better get on with it and do it now. Yes. But of course the beauty of it is you've done it at school haven't you? Yes. And once you've done it at school, it comes back with a bit of an effort quite quickly. Yeah I've got a reasonable vocabulary Yes. Yes. but never really spoken it at all. I mean we never did any French trips. Didn't you? was useless for languages when I was there. Was it? Yes absolutely hopeless. We never did any trips of that nature at all actually. And what was the teaching system? Er had they by the time you were still at school come on to that new erm er system where you speak a lot more? No. No. You've done it out of grammar books? Yes. Mm. Yes. I remember Mm. it was, yeah vocabulary tests and that sort of thing which Mm. Mm. you know er well it's er it's a middle ages approach to Well actually the one thing you can say about it is, it is a good grounding for what you now go on and do Mm. because erm wherever you go now for refresher lessons, they will use the modern method. Yeah. And that's, that will build on that foundation. Yes. You'll be astonished how quickly it'll come back. Mm mm. You really will. Hopefully. Mm. Yes all we had when I was at school were l l yards of verbs and yards of nouns, we never knew how to put the two lots together. No. That's true. Yeah. Mm. The people who had the imagination or ability to do it where the ones that could speak the languages, the ones that didn't Yes it was made no connection at all. Mm. Because I knew a lot of nouns and a lot of verbs, I could get by when I went to Algeria in Mm. nineteen forty but it was I envied those who could really speak. Yeah. Mm. But erm if you see some officer floundering for the word for a cabbage or something of that sort I could provide the word and he provided the conversation. Yes. Mm. Yes. Well actually you're going to a centre aren't you er in where there will be evening classes and that sort of opportunity? Yes. I think probably It's, it's it's well erm served for for Mm I would imagine it's quite well led. Mm. Ya. And you'll have no problem, yes. Mm. Aha. I'll have to give up my art classes then which is Art? haven't been doing them recently but when I've been able to get a, er an evening away that's what I Mm mm. spend my time doing over the past few years. Yes but will it rule it out altogether do you think if you've got to do the French? Well A Alison goes out for one evening so that means I have to get back early for that evening Mm. and then if I, I go out for another one, that means two evening evenings back Yes. leaving the office at five thirty on the dot and of course Yes. I, I can't do that more than twice a week. No. No I see. Your work itself is going to take more time than that. Well yes. Is that just at first or is it regularly? No I mean it's, it's always been the case. Mm. Mm. Ya. Mm. It's tough really. It is tough. It's very erratic the work as well, it's it's Yes, is it? very, you know, stop start Yes. Is it still advertising? Yes. Yes. Yeah. You must be pretty good at that by now. Well I've got quite a lot of experience I mean I've Yes you have. I've done it since I was, well it's getting on for fifteen years now. It isn't? Yeah, thirteen years in, in Mm. the same area Mm. I've not really moved around a lot No. No. in the actual function. No. Just sort of progressed up the ladder I suppose Yes. Mhm. so, yes Yes. Oh well, you can only make the best of the thing you've got and that's the best thing to do rather than Mm. unless you're forced to switch er horses, you know in, in mid stream. Yeah. Well i i I always say that er it always comes a surprise that I was good at anything. And I always think back to the er the time I think Edmund and I were sitting in the back garden here and deciding that we'd go off and join the paratroopers Really? because we weren't going to get any O levels. Oh! And that was about all we were good for . I'm sorry. How funny. But in fact you did get your O levels didn't you? So I remember well I got a handful Yes I remember Mm. And Edmund got a B A. Yeah. Ah but wait a minute, not until after that was it? yes. He got his O levels but that was it. Yes. Decided he'd had enough and I suppose you had too. Mm well Did you stay on for As? Yes I did. Mm. But again I you know I always had the ability to er to know, to scrape by Yes. or knowing what the minimum required was and er pitching myself at just over that point I think. Yes. Which I suppose is some sort of ability Well it's a it's a, in a way that's quite true. Mm. Yes it saves the er er the use of excess energy when you don't need to doesn't it? Yes. That's right. Ah. Edmund was lucky because he got this chance to do a university you see in Mm. in er New Hampshire wasn't it? Yes. Erm Well that's when er Ben and I saw him, when he was doing it That's right, you did. doing that, yes. You did. Yeah. But I'd love to see him again. Oh yes. I'd love to get a trip out there. It would be wonderful wouldn't it? Yes. He'd so love to see people and of course at the moment Mm. he daren't make trips, or at least it wouldn't be wise to make trips yet I know, yes I know because he's waiting for his Yes, naturalization. Shame really. Yes. That's right. Can I pour you another cup of tea Ian? I'm fine actually, thank you. We've got photographs, recent ones, to show you anyway. Oh good. And we saw him in September October didn't we? Yes yes End of September beginning of October Good. and stayed they had a barn just a little way from the house, you could see it but it Right. wasn't very striking It was No it was, it was just grey and, and, and Yes. quite unobtrusive. Well they've had a marvellous sort of conversion of that done Mm. for guests and erm Because they had a beautiful house anyway didn't they? Oh a beautiful house Mm. yes and they're still in the same house. They they're Yes. very fond of it. And erm so now when we go they're awfully sweet and they bring Edmund at the same time Oh right. and we all three, Noel and Edmund and I, live in this barn. Oh that's lovely. ideal. Which is marvellous. for breakfast. George did that, really, so that when his grandchildren came he hadn't got them under his feet. No, it's a good idea. And he, well he's, he was wealthy enough to do exactly as he wanted. Yes. Yeah. It sounds ideal. It's lovely. Yeah. It's very lovely. They're such nice people. Yeah. And of course they I didn't meet him. Oh didn't you? No I only met erm Ellie Ellie. very briefly as well. Well it was summer, wasn't it? Yes er no it was April. Oh. April and the son And had they gone away then? the son was there. Dan. Dan was around and the other, the, the younger one. Oh John. I c I don't remember his name. Er John was the youngest. Yes I think it was him. Mike wouldn't be, I think he was w er getting on a bit, oh mess room and the cook was always a youngster who started in the quarry. That's the way you started, up a ladder to the to be a managing director . A cook. You know like like the this thing about every soldier having a a a field marshall's baton in his knapsack . anyway erm they started at Well you know quite an easy job but the the er s their wage was about sev I I I I forget. I d I wouldn't know. I think my my starting salary at fifteen was seven and six. Out of that I had to find, threepence a day erm bus fare. Excuse me. And we worked six w six I mean we worked Saturday mornings you know, six o'clock. Plus er going up going to you know, all that. Sos there wasn't much left of the seven and six to kee feed me and all that . And er I think after and when I became sixteen that er had to start paying your your m paying the union I had to join the union as a junior member you know. And er hospital fund and all this business. Anyway erm so you . our standard of living Well our standard of living was alright. I mean er didn't bring much home. And er the cook I think the boys e had about er started on ten shillings you know, ten shillings a week. Erm but er that was this boy's job and then he used to er you know, scrub the tables in the rest room and of course boil the water first thing in the morning. And er wash the cups and And he used to have to go running er down with messages down to or down to the head office rather that we had an office in where where our fitting shop was where there was a draughtsman's office. And a store, a store a sort of store clerk. Cos we had other people concerned with the stores down in the head office as well, the buyers and . And a couple of young clerks, that's where they bred their clerks for the future use sort of thing you know. I see. And this cook had to go down and carry messages back and forth and all that was his job as cook. Not he he couldn't handle a a roast duck or er couldn't roast a duck or anything like that you know. Or make orange sauce or er anything of that sort . Er and I don't think any other most of them started and they're still here some of them. Er still roast a duck any more than I can. Well er not without a a book of instructions anyhow beside me anyway. Er anyway the that was the cook's job and that was my job, I used to sort of go across and fetch this tea and have it ready by the time the men gave up work at nine o'clock. But er I used to go I didn't eat with the men you weren't allowed to eat with the men you see, it was only the full men that sat round this table well That was Half about eight of them you see. Well it was the same no distinction at all in that sense, but er you know we were sort of they had more serious things to talk about than I wan er you know I knew the cook, er couple of o other apprentices from the carpenters shop we used to go into the main th there was no-one to keep an eye on us in the in the mess-room you see, no-one to tell us. So we could play. And erm at the same time there was an old mill there as well, with an old er engine room. Which had apparently been a a steam There had been a steam engine turning this er mill crushing mill and er er I remember there was a name in in this engine it was Queen of the Valley. And erm we used to go and play in that sort of you know do the things that boys usually do. Sort of Oh we used to risk our necks walking across the ruddy this mill was a bit of a wreck actually and we used to go playing in places where we shouldn't have really. Anyway, that's beside the point. But erm and then at during er before lunch and all that I used to have to go take a bucket and go to the smithy and erm as you may know, there's a a cooling er tank beside in the in er beside every every every erm blacksmith's fire and er you know to bo keep the er no t no to keep the nozzle of the Of the blower? blower going you see. Oh. How do you do? How do you do? Hi. And this co er and used to get w hot water from this tank you see, lift it out with a ooh with some sort with a ladle actually. Er and er put it in the bucket and get the right temperature. Up my elbow and er anyway put it used to take it back to the shop and er well I was still inside the shop, down to a certain place in the shop and put it on a on a stand and then there'd be a on that stand, beside the bucket, was a a box of not Lux not Lux soap but er yellow soap. Oh yes. in Welsh. And erm slabs of it it had been cut like er it looked you know if you sort of cut lard or something like that. No you don't belong to that age either do you. Erm you know you get it in packets now anyway. But er you know used to sli cut it out of er big chunks. But er there's be lump of this y yellow er stuff you know. And beside that again, another box full of erm well partly full depended on what time of the week it was. Erm dust quarry dust and er very very fine chippings you know. So you got a handful of this yellow soap. And er rubbed it and it was quite very hard you know. And er put a dollop er dipped your hand into this the grit as well started rubbing using the water we'd got. Some hot water. And see my hands they they they're quite they're they're exactly like a er well shall we say an educated person's hand A person who's spent his life working behind a desk. But you know it's funny how why it was so I mean the grit and those were quite sharp you know You you'd have thought that it would have taken your skin but then it was ideal stuff for getting the grease the you know the dirt and I mean the the greasy dirt away. It's easy enough to dirt . That was the method that we used and I didn't I never heard I didn't hear of dermatitis or anything until well twenty five years afterwards. Erm I mean the one could very easily have have got er some form of dermatitis with all the you know various oils and stuff that we had to put our hands in. But erm and all the old mill for milling that we used to used I mean kept our hands clean anyway. So that was one job a and then we had a big used to beg for a an old sack from the stores and open that out and er I used to wash them wash it and get it very soft and clean and hang that up and that's the way used to clean and keep ourselves cl hands clean . And er but for all this, erm funny enough we we had er a fair in twice a year. we haven't had one for oh many what fifteen, twenty years a co er there used to be a couple of women used to come to sell rock. Up to about twen they kept the thing going their pitch going I suppose twen to about twenty years ago. But we had a a spring fair in April and the other in October. I think so. And the fair was on the first of October. somewhere round that time. I I'd er you know the older men would tell you. Cos I I didn't sort of go by fairs and things like that, I belonged to a different generation. Erm but erm come the time had come for for the fair let's say the the the Spring fair. I'd get quite a surprise because very s small number of men in the shop. I get about shillings eight and six, nine bob pocket money. Fair money they used to call it you see. Mhm. Er I know er perhaps I was er civil or obedient or whatever, I don't know but er I I they u they used to have this this collection for the for supposedly for carrying the water, I don't know. But erm er it was a a nice sum to be to take with you to the fair . You know. Er because it was more than a weeks wages . To spend evening. And used to happen twice a year and erm sometimes somebody'd remember my birthday or find that I had my birthday or and at Christmas time we used to get some money. And this was out of a you know er I mean they were only what Oh couldn't be more than about six eight people working in the Well not actually fitters but er you know, they were involved within the shop sort of thing. I don't know how many t other people were approached in this collection, I don't know. But erm they were you know they were exceedingly kind really. Yeah they were very kind too. Cos their salary we we well their wages weren't much. They I believe that er a craftsman's wage was somewhere they'd a take home pay at the end of the fortnight. You'll notice that I say end of the fortnight, that was the settling time . Er was three guineas. Was it? It was one and three an hour. the craftsman and fitter's rate in those days. And a labourer's rate was eleven pence an hour. Mm. Wh what erm what ye what year would this be that you sort of s I don't k nineteen thirty seven maybe? Thirty seven? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. And erm you know it was a a bad time really b you know it was the thirties I mean people say it's bad now but er I don't think it's it's as bad now as it was then. I know the unemployment figures may be higher and all this business, but erm I mean er a single person during those days, er say a young man in his teens, working would been s stopped in the quarry. They were bad times, they used to stop. Er they were very fair er if I may bring in er this has nothing to do with my er well no it has as well. You know friends of mine, I knew them. Erm they were quite fair the the in this quarry then. Cos if it was slack or anything they they used to stop the bachelors first you know. I see. Er you know I I I af I mean after I didn't think anything of it, and in those days I was too young of course to think of th things like that. But thinking back I mean they they were it was very good of them really you know,the they were very fair. Er in the way that they and they sort of well I suppose it was the situation in which the quarries you know sort of or and . And er the foreman and bosses that knew people and they knew the circumstances and I suppose they put a word in and erm you know men were sort of stopped because er I mean, if a man had a house full of children or something, he'd probably be the very last you know before he was sort of forced to g you know sacked or wh And I mean they weren't sacked in a sense, they was always ready there was a place ready for them to come back to there. But erm So laid off I suppose would be a more appropriate way of s of putting it. So that it was it was generally thought of as being a fair system ? Yes. In the main I I should think yes. You know you know erm a young man I mean it was er er reasonable wasn't it for a a single man to be laid off before a married man with family family responsibilities. And er generally er with families being larger er in those days, erm there'd be perhaps another couple of sons working or or something like to help. make a family income you know or or increase the family income. Or So they could all eat at least. And erm no well as I say, erm I think they were pretty fair. I mean f I d I doubt whether firms would do it these days eh? It wouldn't be considered fair today anyway. No the union would step in probably and er say that er last in er first out or some ruddy Mm. nonsense like that eh? But that's the memory I have of it eh? Wh when you went in as an apprentice, did you have any i i idea of what the job was. What it entailed? Oh yes, erm you know, having been brought up w in a you could almost say a quarrying atmosphere that's the right er expression but erm I mean one knew what w went on in the quarry you know. Erm mind you it was really a step onto something else that as far as I was concerned in those days I meant o go to sea of course and er that was the best place you could have er to serve an apprenticeship because everything er I mean it was one of the As everything was starting to get specialized in in other works nowadays it's gone completely now. But erm we had a sort of a spectrum you know it covered such a wide well area if you like of er of engineering that one wouldn't have had a chance to to have a any contact with in in any other works, you'd be doing as one certain sphere you know a certain type of work, and there you are you that's your lot eh? But we covered everything you know, steam engines and diesel engines and oh crushers and construction work and development and pneumatic gear, compressors and oh any damn thing that went going. We made everything ourselves more or less. And had a hand in oh designing really there. We were always taught This er comes back again. I think er you know this our our boss, er who Mr as he was called he was given his full title of er Mr William Owen , then. I mean er much more should have been something should have been Aye he's well worth er within the engineering world at least, well worth looking into his life really. Because he he he's done a a you know he he he's been a a a a what shall I say, a Well he's done a lot really to to to to to promote erm interest in engineering and all that and and he's done a lot in helping er to young men to become engineers and that you know. He he he's erm really er the results of his his interest in teaching. Er North Wales you know have have benefited. Firms in North Wales here along the coast which came after the war of course. Can you sort of amplify that if you can? Well As I told you to begin with, he he he he must he was a man was er years ahead of his tim really. I mean and he he although he er he wasn't a graduate or anything like that I mean he he was a brilliant engineer. His ideas are as I they they say that he was er I don't know how much truth I that he was the first that he patented and devised the first rotating drilling machine. Rock drilling machine you see. Cos the f the the the they did have pneumatic drilling machines quarries. For ooh from beginning of the century I suppose. But they were only hammers in a sense. They only hammered the they the the they didn't rotate. I see. They just r r rammed their way and you had an man the they had a man they tell me I I've never seen one But erm this was as far as I can make out er by the They had a man standing by you see with a a spanner and er gave it a quarter turn every time it hammered the the drill sort of hit the rock, went into the and hammered. They had to give it a quarter turn you see with a spanner. But erm that old the A and B we used to call them actually. A and B. Erm there was no dis disrespect but A and B and er he'd erm he devised a method he what he did he rifled the inside of the the piston. He rifled the inside of the the the the cylinder and the piston was rifled as well, you know slightly ribbed, so as it went forward it turned you see. Came back and there was a er it couldn't turn cos there was erm Oh dear I'm forgetting my engineering terms but er you know it's a that's the . And that's this is er I think I've already told you that he was offered a job with Ingersoll Rand which were the main er people that dealt with air and air products in the old days. The American firm. They tried to get him to America you see. But he wouldn't go there. William didn't want to take his overalls off. Because he he liked to work with his hands. Yes he was a heck of a man. He could he was a brilliant machinist and er oh crikey I've seen him turn out a a three throw er crankshaft within a couple of days er you know without any precise measuring and and and in fact he just sort of put his roll on on on a on the shaft he was turning and just sort of gave him an idea as to I mean his eye was almost as good as many a bloke's measur measurement with a rule. But er a three throw crankshaft for a bump you know couple of days to erm he was a heck of a man. And he dis We had I haven't told you er didn't tell you or h I er don't think I've told you have I, that we did have a a chemist in the quarry you know. Full time chemist. Would he be analyzing samples? Yeah analyzing yes. Mr his name was. And he apparently was a very very nice man too er I mean he was I mean er er er er a nice disposition I mean yeah. they stand out . And er oh he he was he erm during the war now come nineteen thirty nine and that stale period when er there was nothing doing really in France, between the time that er our expedition to the to the Maginot line and all that. Er he went over s there was a plane laid on for him and he was ve went over very often to advise them on fortifications on all their concrete fortifications in France. Did he? Yes yeah. Very well thought off actually. And he designed some er I remember them being built. Erm air raid shelters. Built to his design under the rock face up at the top here in . And er concrete and all stuff. And er rock er dropped use that expression, they used they were both right at the at the foot of the quarry face or precipice or whatever somewhere around a hundred foot high and then th they blasted the top see and dropped a whole fall. A fall is what we call you know a bundle of Rock. rock there. Ah excuse me. And erm on this er structure and obviously there wasn't a everything was fine inside it. Mind you, no-one volunteered to stay inside when it was . But erm all the intact Now, a slight apology to make. This, things aren't going very well for me today. Er, I missed the train, the video thing wouldn't work when I showed my film lunchtime and er, the book that had to read, er, unfortunately, is not in the library, so er, the le let me explain the background to this. In previous years I haven't had a class on the and I thought I had one this year as an experiment and er, pardon me just a second hello yes, that was a little annoying to say the least, cos those students have come in specially for that, yeah,yeah yeah yeah yeah right Oh dear right certainly not well, would it be easier to show them in my office, that's seven, seven, seven? Well, I could fit most of them in, I'm currently getting in about twelve, ten or twelve, I could fit them in. Alright, let's do that. Could we, could we have it from next Tuesday in my room? That's seven, seven, seven. Yeah, and you could perhaps let me, let me have erm, let me have one of those little ones. Perhaps I could keep it, could I? Right, okay yes, sure, sure, sure. Well, shall we have it in my room for next week? Thanks a lot. Bye . This audio visual, ah I apologize for that. Sorry, this will be printing for a while. It's just my new book. I'm sorry. You'll just have to put up with the printer chugging away. As I was saying, yes, er erm, I put it down, erm are you gonna tell us the history of the book, or? Yeah. There is a bit of Right, okay. Well, let's wait and hear wh what says, he'll probably explain to you the history of why it is like this. But as I said, I do apologize. There was a copy in the library at one stage, although not listed under it was under , but I now see that when the other day I looked erm, according to er, there isn't even anything under . Did you look under too? Yeah Right, right so I'm very sorry. I won't do it again next year. We won't have a class on that's just somebody that republishes the book. But erm, anyway er, tell us what you made of it and we'll take it from there, I think. Well, the book was er published in the early nineteen, well, it was written in the early nineteen thirties but er, it wasn't actually published until nineteen sixty seven. Erm, for instance idealistic man primarily, Wilson, President of the United States. So basically, subject given account of er Wilson's life and his personality. In context the psychoanalysis in order to explain erm Wilson's actions and er, attitudes in the pres presidency of the United States during the First World War, basically con concentrates on erm . Despite highlighting er Wilson's intellectual and physical achievements, for instance, he er wrote a very er, well respected book called Con Congressional Government in his earlier cabinet career, and also he initiated domestic reforms , the book is er generally quite scornful, reporting character. Especially the neurosis he suffered from erm, throughout his life on which the his presidential and political career. The main argument put forward by er, er, was that er was that Wilson suffered as an adult, because of the over oppressed rage he, oppressed rage he possessed, which was directed towards his father. As a child, Wilson was er, regularly subjected to the darkness father and criticized and lectured the young Wilson. However, instead of er releasing and dealing with his rage, Wilson er instead chose to strongly identify with his father, erm argued er Wilson never grew beyond his father identification, because the situation whereby er Wilson was full of, of the conviction that his er mission in life was somehow divided. In identifying with what he regarded as his father, Wilson thought that he would er emerge from the war as a saviour to the world, so to speak. two went further in an effort to oppress his rage against his father, and to avoid a highly threatening career situation. Wilson identified with his father, to the extent of wanting to have genital, genital contact with him, since Wilson saw his father as the author of all his skills, his strength and all that he'd been grateful for . This was based on apparently wrote to obtain er, or basically to obtain. This is arguably supported by the close contact of the relationship Wilson had with his father, and Wilson's deeply held religious conviction, which he espoused in his presidency. However, this subconsciously held conflict with his father in subsequent over identification with er led Wilson to be somewhat stubborn,perhaps even complicational as a, as you know, as presidency of the United States, which were, were often directed towards or often only minor details of his work, but he wouldn't he wouldn't actually range them towards say, any major . Er, accompanying this accompanying this frequently not himself, which it occurred throughout his life, through his childhood as well, and his general er sustained willpower which was highlighted by frequent illnesses, especially in his er president of the university, where Wilson suffered defeats and conflicts and transfer of reform of rebuilding the university, and also we see there er back part of his life a Wilson of his own er, seem to direct some of his rage against er, a coloured colleague of his, a . Graham argued that all this is indicative of a person who hasn't grown, fully grown out of his childhood worries, problems, especially the er, he hasn't actually dealt with the true feelings that he had towards his father, and who instead chose to vent his rage on others and political career, which resulted in Wilson being, er well, losing some of his rationality, which led to his poor performance in er negotiating and gaining acceptance of the Treaty of after World War One. Erm, apparently that's what the trouble with the ratifying in Congress that led him erm,some degree to another centre in Massachusetts. Erm, and this also explains in part, why he er complains made by-rules and all concerned what was into Europe, did not materialize. Er, I think if you're gonna try and erm, explain you know, try and assess the validity of the book. Agree or ask yourselves why you agree. Tell us about various reasons, not just study of value of the great of the greatest value there. It seems Freud and perhaps even wanted to er, vent their anger on Wilson, because of his failures concerning the war and its aftermath. Immediately after the war, when Bullett first approached Freud er, with the idea of writing the book, Freud was apparently feeling very depressed, and er, he was savagely critical of his own work, and er, because he had little access to patients during the war, he generally felt quite down and also by presenting written for him, all he would need to wr all he would need to write, and according to er,other people, perhaps he was eating, he was receiving just sort of waiting to die. Whether that's er,I'm not too sure. Erm, anyway, this was when Bullett actually first approached Freud ninetee nineteen hundred and twenty. The disappointment with Wilson felt like Freud must have sort of lingered for quite a long time, cos it was not for eight years that he actually ventured on . This was highlighting the fact, that although, er, Freud thought psychoanalytic should be used in a neutral nerve and not used for any active aggression, an exception seemed to be made with Woodrow Wilson. Although some may be quick to say that the vast majority of the book was actually written by Bullett, and not by Freud, no less than the actual intellectual framework of the book apparently seems to have been due to Freud's input, er, Freud certainly was psychoanalytically trained, in any, in any sense of the word. Er, perhaps the whole project could also be attributed, mainly I think, to Freud's desire to try and keep open the er, the er, analytic publishing house, which he founded in and which er, basically was kept together financially from the er, forwarded, forwarded er, royalties which Bullett sent from America. er, the book has been very heavily attacked by contemporary writers even mentioned passing for the . Complaints have been made, for instance, by erm, er,. The er, book is based on an inaccurate and sometimes even fabricated evidence, due probably to the er, rather idealistic er, excitable ambitious er Bullett, rather than the peaceful like of Freud. Nevertheless, evidence er, was dealt with by our assorted version parent. Much due to the influence of Freud, cos of course, Bullett wasn't a . Contemporary studies of Wilson by, for example, or perhaps even are apparently based much more on fragmented material than Bullett and Freud, Freud would allow. I can't really clarify that . Erm, for example, it appears that Freud and Bullett er, misinterpreted Wilson, especially as regards to the nature of his father. For example, argues that Wilson did not have any sort of homosexual likeness for his father. But that Wilson longed for a psychic union with fantasy, fantasy father. So that er, Woodrow could experience a full sense of self, to actually relate back to his himself, which er, Wilson er, experienced only as a child. His childhood. Er, you have a sexualization of such a long period, Wilson, er, didn't seem to have, sort of, being recorded to his sexual fantasies of that nature. Although there is er a general agreement that Wo situations were, were re really more complicated,in the Wilson family, er,Wil erm, Wilson actually certainly loved his father, his er his mother an and his er father. Er,Wi Wilson, er, did not seem to allow his father's wit and criticism to get him as much as Freud had er, suggested. Er, certainly evidence seems to suggest that a very genuine and close relationship developed with his father. For ex for instance, they er, often confided in one another , usually when they to see what they actually er share each other 's deepest thoughts, and this continued throughout later life, it could be argued bu but it continued throughout later life and what they, they often communicated by er, by letter. It could be argued from this, that er, Wilson's father began to identify more of his son rather than the other way round. Especially as Wilson's academic career flourished, and he er, and he wrote to his father less and less. So of er, resulted in a rather er, sad feeling in his father, the thought that actually his son was starting you started to by his son. argues that er, Wilson suffered from strokes throughout his life,not even emotionally recorded due his psychological condition. The reason why this occurred er erm, the reason why this occurred was not due to some sort of er, due to emotional problems that he suffered within these repressed relations with his son. Erm, and also the reason why Wilson could not actually read until the age of eleven was not due to the emotional er, problems of his father, it was due to a sort of a form of dyslexic er,th there's a hell of a lot of debate about this, er, all these things just what er, Einstein is er, criticizing. But er,sad sadly there's er, evidence that sh show that if there is a dyslexic. Erm, however, it maintains that er, Freud could not have er, known about this, although it seems to invalidate if they are correct . Erm, if the move on the was psychoanalytic issue, er despite the book being generally regarded as an embarrassment to psychoanalytic, is somewhat non . It er, has initiated others to demonstrate how the use of a psychoanalytic science for the actions of upstanding, public, historical figures. Biographical studies can be found on a variety of historical people, including various artists or politicians. But this simply underlines a point that psychoanalysis is, by the very nature biographical, thus historical point, er, historical methods to trace one's actions and reports in the presents, present er, relation to those who they've experienced in the past. If your psychoanalysis is reports, and not just the actions, of it can be a, used as arguments to er, allow this story to emphasise what the human ages evolved at specific suicide of men, erm, goes on to show examples of his erm, he actually claimed to have used this as a sort of process of identification of even fantasizing, in order to try and er demonstrate how er, I think it was Hadrian's Wall was built, try to identify with engineers and architects who built Hadrian's Wall, in order to try and work out what the actual function of the wall was. It wasn't, it wasn't regarded, it was regarded by a positivistic er,as just being er a big wall to stop barbarians er, attacking . People have said he er, they seem to think, that he was more, he was more the sort of territorially divide sheriff sort of er, league of division between er, the two lands, and he was also a sort of lookout post. Erm, this er, again, try to be right be er try to understand the mind,instead of just, just looking at the harsh facts, the hard cold facts and trying from there. So, in effect, there's a subjective animal which can be very useful when trying to explain a glimpse, for example, employed for example the total I E prime and er, also in the psychological . These books also extend beyond a biographical compass of the history, by examining the development of insecurities in society, like as in the future of civilian. And also the relationship between the leaders and the masses in history, er, between the different groups er and then comparing the relations between these masses and different groups and different parts of history. Er, and it can be also er, also er, course in civilizations in history and trace in theory selection in society. Er, psychoanalysis is important, because it acts as a realis as a realistic er, dimension to historical analysis. There is a tendency to try and lo er, continually adjust the plain hard facts, without recognizing that they are, they are in fact socially constructed. That's the objective. It must be supplemented with the subject. For allowing ourselves to look at the report and find the actions, and not just the actions themselves. Erm, so in this, so in times of the Woodrow Wilson or perhaps Freud er, took the subject too, too far. Allow his own feelings and thoughts just to run away with him, which later er, in rather er, a nasty very er, made some very disparaging remarks of the family. But despite the er, rather individualistic nature of the context used there's enough flexibility and openness within the subject content, to say . The psychoanalysis can be used to a limited extent, despite more collective, historical roles er, within disagreed over conflicts in people, or perhaps you say that all the time. Erm, going back to the subjective erm, psychoanalysis introduces erm, no, that's the subject erm, psychoanalysis introduces. Also historians themselves, historians themselves can't actually completely stand outside the events they are actually studying. I mean,th th they're just moving away from the issue, because it it's using a psychoanalytic stories. Try to give a psychoanaly psychoanalytic study issue. Erm, can you keep with me? The er, the very important experiences of this story were never to be received into his work. Or our work. And would be useless the er, content and electrons. I suppose er, suppose that, suppose that er, main department store other contents from other dimensions. Psychological content, but again, in that content, in that er, particular content, psychoanalytical context can be useful. Well done,w well done , excellent, I mean. Although as I said, it was perhaps a mistake, erm, both classes produced excellent papers, that th it was a first class paper, in the other class and so was yours. didn't read the book. Where did you get all that material from then? Erm, books on psycho history publish yours. Right,. Oh, you went through all the psycho history books? Yeah, well done. Erm, well it's a great achievement. I think that given that you were er, you couldn't find the basic book that you were expected to read, I thought you, you gave an excellent account of it, I mean, if you hadn't told us that you hadn't got the book, I don't think we would have guessed, would we? You would've got away with that one. But erm, no, absolutely first rate. Well done. I think you can, you can really erm, you can really be proud of yourself on that. And erm well, what do other people think, I mean what, I suppose no one else began to look at it either. I will be giving a lecture on it, so I'll have my say about it. Erm, has anybody looked at any of the other books, like for example, the one on ? Did you? I didn't have time. Has anybody got the time? I'll tell you the reason why I did this. Erm, in a way this was a bit provocative. What I what I thought was, well let's have erm, Woodrow Wilson, okay, as you said at the beginning of the book, Freud admits that he didn't like Wilson, and that he felt betrayed by Wilson, like a lot of people in Central Europe did I suppose, because you know, Wilson came over erm, with fourteen points as the saviour of the world, and went away leaving with a piece of . And Freud and a lot of other German speaking people, thought that he had let them down, because he didn't have the political goodness. Erm, and so Freud at the beginning says that he er, he, he had a personal dislike of er Wilson, and resented him for what he had done and held him responsible for the subsequent disasters. So, so Freud makes no bones about it. Erm, the book by Leo who's er Labour, was a Labour M P, no longer er keen collection reports. Erm, on , I put in because it was the worst example I could find of the abuse of psychoanalysis for destroying somebody's personality, personality assassination by, by er a psychoanalysis. You could imagine what it's like. I mean, erm, if you didn't know it was meant to be serious, you might think it was a great send off of psychoanalysis, you know. Kind of make you hoot with laughter half the time, erm, and the contrast with that is the point, which I don't know whether any of you has looked at, of course, called Gandhi's Truth. Well, as you might tell from the title, Gandhi's Truth is the exact opposite to book, because it idealizes Gandhi, it makes a, a kind of psychoanalytic behaviourography, you know as if Gandhi was some er, great great kind of saint. Despite the fact that Gandhi one would have thought provided rich material for psychoanalysts, like going to bed with his erm, nieces and his lady doctor erm, and naked and claiming that this was a specific exercise, erm. Nice work if you can get it. Erm, and so on, so, so, so this was the, this was the, er this is what I was trying to do, try and contrast the use of psychoanalysis in, in biography, from character assassination on one hand, to hagiography at the other, and with Freud's Woodrow Wilson somewhere in, in between , but perhaps nearer the character assassination end, because erm, neither of them, er neither of the authors were, really had, had much of a brief of Woodrow Wilson. And, and really it was just as experiment, and erm, the reason I put it in was, I thought, well, you know, this is, this is an ignored book, and as you, as you found to your cost, it's actually hard to come by, harder to come by than I expected. It's out of print. Yeah, it's out of print, and erm, but I though it raised interesting issues, anyway. I mean did other people think that? And what kind of issues did you think it does raise? It's not worth psychoanalysis Right, now as mentioned, there's a whole literature on this course,ps psycho-history, isn't there? They've even got their own journal. Have you, have you read any of this stuff,? Erm, this is, this is what this school of thought tries to do. In the past I used to have a, a class on psycho- history, and I dropped it, and one of the reasons why I dropped it was, the lit a lot of the literary was very poor quality, for a start, and erm, people, er, students, er got that too, and I couldn't really blame them. And, er, the other problem with it is, you really have to know quite a lot about history, or biography to really to really get into. I think you found that with Wilson There was one chapter in the book, I read it in the . All the pages in biography . Five or six pages instant analysis and it hardly No. Absolutely, so Two novels If yo I hope you, I suppose you could have a whole course in psycho-history, if you really put into it enough, but for just one class, I thought it was too much to ask students to attend, to try and have to get into psycho-history, so I haven't erm, done very much of it, and this, my excuse here really was, well Freud did write a book called Woodrow Wilson. It is touching on the social sciences in the sense that Woodrow Wilson was an important political figure, and there is an historical dimension. So that was my excuse, for, for, for bringing it in. But as says, I mean it raises er, a fundamental issue, which is, is psychoanalysis or, psycho, are psycho insights applicable to for example history or biology, and this is the issue, isn't it? What do people think that? Is it just, is it, is it, is it just trivializing, to think, to talk about, for example, Woodrow Wilson's childhood? I mean, does anybody think that's a trivial approach to history? I mean Do you think so? Yeah. Do everybody agree with that? you tell it Yes, of course, erm the point has to be made, that Bullett, unlike contemporary erm, biographers of er Wilson, those people you mentioned, actually knew Wilson, and an you know, being his administration on that man as it were , and apparently Bullett had a lot a first-hand erm, biographical data, didn't he, according to the book? Also tended towards to make a judgment of him, Mm. I think Right. Right, and the background to that of course is, for those of you who may not know, Bullett was I suppose a more junior person in the State Department, when he went to Europe with Woodrow Wilson in nineteen eighteen, and nineteen whenever it was for a peace conference, and Bullett was the only one of the American delegation who resigned and confronted Wilson and said, look, you've gone back on the fourteen points, you're not doing what you said you would do. How can you go on with this, and Bullett was the only one of them who resigned and went home. And er, later of course, he became the American Ambassador of Vienna, so Freud met him, but so, so, Bullett had a personal stake in this, but I must admit, er my own view was, was rather to admire Bullett for his stand, because it's a rare politician who stands up and says look, you know, we've been there, having made promises, we've broken all of them, and we ought to resign, or you ought to resign. He told Wilson. And, and he said, you know, if you aren't going to resign, I certainly am. And he did. So erm, it's quite true that Bullett had a personal axe to grind, I think it was a rather justified axe. But erm, it er, that fact remains, he did nail Wilson. He was at the conference, and a lot of the book, if you read the book, is concerned with what actually happened at the conference, and basically, the basic problem with the, the book tries to look at, and this is where we, we get back to question of the childhood days. Why couldn't Wilson stand up to the allies, why couldn't had stand up to Clements or Lloyd George, in particular? They seem to have bullied him and made him er, make concessions, and the question that Freud and Bullett constantly ask is, why did Wilson make these concessions, especially since his position was already defined before he came to Europe, you know he already laid down the fourteen points, and sold it to the American people. And then he came to Europe and, and really, let it all go. And their answer of course is, look, here was erm, there's no political or historical reason, because Wilson had all the cards in his hand. The, admittedly the French and the British were on the right side, they won the war, but France er was er battered in the war, lost an awful lot of people, it's a common and although this country, although, you know, fighting in Britain, the er, British economy was also badly damaged. We were borrowing money from the Americans to keep going, and er, we certainly weren't in any shape to dictate the terms of the peace to the Americans. And er, so Freud and Bullett say, look if Wilson had all the power at the time, and some ways the world in nineteen eighty to twenty was a bit like what it is today, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, really, you really only got one superpower. If, if the Americans had all the power, why did Woodrow Wilson just sell out to the Allies? So, Bullett and Freud conclude, well, it has to be something to do with him personally. And their conclusion is, he couldn't stand up to, to Lloyd George in and the reason was these were strong, erm, male leaders, and Wilson, when it came to being with men, er, was weak, and the question asked is, why was he weak in dealing with men? And the answer is, well, if you look at his relationship with his father, er, he was very overawed by his father, he was very passive and submissive towards his father. And so there they, they claim that his childhood was relevant, because of this character defect in, in Wilson, his inability to stand up to strong men. Even though objectively, he had all the strength on his side, and if he'd only stubbornly insisted, the allies would have had to accept the fourteen points, because there was no way that they just didn't have any erm, any clout really when when finally settled in peace. Wilson could almost have dictated it to them, and perhaps another man would have. So this is their justification for bringing in the childhood. What do you think of that remark? Is that legitimate, do you think, or not? Yeah, I think it is. erm you have, when you see the statesmen Well, what about the view, let me kind of play devil's advocate here against Freud and Bullett. What about the view? That in history, the important things of economic, er historical, social forces which transcend any individual. What about that view, that the individual person, even a powerful one, like the President of the United States, doesn't really count, compared with economic social geo-political forces, what about that argument?, how does that . Is that the kind of argument that carries any weight with you? Erm, I can tell you what the other to look at the personality things like that Right, right. It seems, you know, because Freud didn't actually analyze just to make a generalization about things he knew about some of the people. Yes. And that sort of thing counts for what Yes, that's that's, let me see who that is? Hi. Well, that's his office there. He's not there now. I don't know. Have a word with his secretary. Erm, the, yes, I mean, this is a big problem, isn't it? The question is, as you rightly say, in psychoanalysis, the analyst usually has a vast amount much more than people normally realize, I mean, I recall from my own analysis, and mean I was going between two and four times a week erm, for an hour each time and it was a good six months before she would make any interpretations, and I used to get very frustrated, you know, I used to say things like, well, what do you think of this, Miss , you know. What do you think of that, and she would say, well, it's too early, or we don't know yet. You know, and she would constantly say that, and before six months, there weren't any interpretations at all. Then when interpretations did come, particularly if I disputed them, then it would be, she would be ready with the information. She would say, there, there's the of that dream, or those associations, with this you did. There was all that, and so on, and she would be ready with it, and there was a lot of material there. The problem, as you rightly say, with this kind of secondhand announcers, that how do you know if you've got enough material, and that it's right? Also, if you actually read the book, there is quite a lot of material in the book, it's quite a big book in some ways, and er, the material on Wilson's childhood and so on, erm, is pretty detailed. I mean there is quite a lot seems to be known about Wilson, and he himself, erm, wrote a lot in enormous correspondence and so on, and many of the points they make, are erm, are fairly well validated. Why, for example, one of the, the points that Freud's book makes, is er when Wilson was confronted with a conflict, particularly with a stronger male, like an elder brother, or his father, he would retreat into speech making, and apparently he used to have a barn where he did it, and he used to go and give speeches in the barn. He used to speak to the hay, as it were, and he would do this, er, rather compulsively. This kind of speech making. And of course, when he was a man, he was famous for his speeches, apparently, he was a great, was a great waffler, you know, it was the age of wafflers, I suppose. Erm, we heard a great, he was a great erm,refratition So when Freud and Bullett say, look, Woodrow Wilson was a great refratition and you can see him doing this in his childhood. There is actual evidence that he did do it in his childhood, and th so they're not erm, they're kind of building everything on a single sentence like Leo does, you know, amazingly enough, Leo 's book starts with entry of Who's Who in a single phrase, where she calls herself daughter of, her father. Doesn't mention her mother, and Leo 's whole thesis about was built on this single phrase in Who's Who. words, some future researched, that the printer here, missed that bit, you know, she should have said, and her mother's name, but her mother's got missed out on the proofs or something, I don't, this is the kind of thing that happens, of course. Leo 's entire book will collapse, er, as, as, as perhaps it should. Being a writer of course, being the data problem, er, this is a big problem in psychoanalysis, because whereas erm, in an analysis, the analyst has er hundreds or probably thousands of hours' data from the pre-associations of the patient, at the end. The er, that kind of thing is never published, and or even, of course, it can't be published normally, and the result is that when analysts draw conclusions based on this very confidential data, or who were talking vastly extent. It, it's very very difficult to, to validate perhaps erm, publicly. Yeah. making explanations the other way round. They are theory that you made a mistake, and you've got to somehow explain that They are They are, they're starting with the end result, and of course in this particular book, they're, what they're starting with really, wasn't a general psychological biography of Wilson, so much has, the problem, why did Wilson give everything away in the conference? That . They work backwards as, as, as you rightly say. The, the, the best defence you could make of that, if you wanted to make a defence of it, would be that in the nineteen twenties and thirties as we've been seeing in the lectures, I'll be saying a bit more about that some psychoanalyse was, was developing. It's analysis of the egos as, as we've been seeing, in analysis was really all, all it could do at the beginning, after the First World War, shall we say. breaking point. After the First World War, ego analysis was developing. Now one of the consequences that ego analysis was, analysts began to feel confident that they could analyze the defences of the ego, as well as what the ego repressed as a result of its defences. As a result of that, you could examine a defensive structure, and work out why it existed. For example, supposing you erm, this, this, this was used principally in child analysis, which didn't exist before the First World War, it was developed afterwards. The problem with child analysis is, children won't be associated, that can be made to free associate. I mean, don't ask me to explain it's technical and so it's a very technical matter of ego psychology that you must accept . They can't be induced to do it. And anyway, they don't have the motives. Children are always for analysis, usually by their parents, they don't usually come of their . So the analysts found they couldn't use free association with children. What they could use, was defence analysis. So for example, if you saw a child, who was pathologically independent, wouldn't form emotional attachments or dependencies on other people of the way the child wanted it. The analyst might conclude, well why is this defence structure excessive independence present in this child? A good suggestion might be, in the past this child has suffered a loss of some figure it was dependent on, and has compensated by becoming highly independent. This was a common finding, and Freud often found this in all children during the war. Some of them compensated by becoming highly independent in the end. So what you could do, you could see the defence, and then from that you could work backwards, to the motive of the defence. So, perhaps the reason is the loss of a love object, and then of course if you found there was a in fact a loss of a love, love object, then you might to see in greater detail, how this whole thing came about. Particularly if you discover that that child didn't have a bad characteristic in their in their ego before this event occurred, and so on. So that kind of thing made analysts think that they could go on more than just free associations, they could look at a person's character, as it were. The structure of ego defences, and then draw conclusions. And really, you see, that's what Freud and Bullett are doing in this book. They're looking at Wilson's character, which was quite a, a peculiar one, in both senses of the word, and not just peculiar in the sense of, of, you obviously need to him a peculiar sense of kind of funny, funny peculiar. And they try to work backwards, as you rightly say, to his childhood, to explain why, and, and of course they felt that their explanation, explained the favour of conflicts, because the whole thing was here was a man with an almighty father. Who saw himself as Jesus, really, and although Jesus came to save the world, he saved the world in a rather masochistic manner, by getting crucified. Well, that's exactly what happened to Woodrow Wilson. He came to save the world in nineteen eighteen, but he got crucified by Clements or Lloyd George. They made mincemeat of fourteen points. And er, so it's, it's an attempt to work backwards, but it has a certain justification in analytic technique. But of course, as you and er, er er, rightly said, in an analysis you would always be able to confirm these interpretations from the patient, because in the end, of course , psychoanalysis is done by the patient, the analyst doesn't do it. The analyst normally just helps. In the end, the analysis is gonna occur, it's the patient who, who really doesn't analyze their ego comes to grips with the unconscious. Of course, in a book you can't handle them, and you can't handle them when the subject is dead. So that will, corroborating dimension of psychoanalysis, what the patient does for himself and cannot possibly count, and as you rightly say, this leaves analytic biography erm, in a, in a kind of limbo. Which is, I really do unsatisfactory. And er, one has to admit, when you look at the literature of like, you know Gandhi, and and this kind of thing, and a lot of it's psycho-history stuff. Erm, you can't help feeling that there has been a mistake. Is that your impression of this? No one does that, yes, that's erm Well, what, why do you think Why? Erm,just having different it's different than what Yeah. it's different than what people normally think Yes, it's interesting you see, if you, if you can compare Freud with other writers who are in the same kind Goodness! in favour of him! Oh well that's awful Stanley! That's a Mason! Yes, oh that's awful! Mm. When Ivy went he took clerk with them down at as a witness. When Ivy went to see her she said oh Mrs Mr came to see me yesterday afternoon he brought another gentleman with him, a nice gentleman so I she said I think they were taking the census, they got me to sign a paper. Oh dear! Oh! And she'd signed her own will! Oh! Dear oh dear! And so when she died, he swept the deck! Oh, that is dreadful! That's a Mason! Mm. Mm. That's dreadful! Yeah, that's a Mason! Mm. Now, there's another one. Old Mrs old lady who was in Framlingham, the dentist? No, I don't reme , no, I don't remember Well in any case that name. She, she come from Walthamstow. And then when her Ah yeah. her husband died she'd picked out a bit of land all this and I borrowed this and one thing and another, so well they never found a penny! Mhm. If we hadn't got the money to pay for cash on delivery I never want it! No. I done without! Mhm. Well we kept on like that and er er people like that we were packing up wholesale so erm I've lost myself a little bit now. No, you were talking about er about your cousin Mr . Oh yes, that's Yes. right! Yes, I was talking about he used to come over here a lot. Mm. Come over here and spent his silver wedding just to come here and his golden wedding! Mhm. He loved to come here take a slog and go down the meadows. Oh yes! That was his type. Aha. He he he er loved that! Mhm. And he loved a horse better than he would a Rolls Royce! Really? Yes Mm mm. he was that type of person. Yes. Well I knew someone in and I thought to myself I, perhaps he might lend me a hand? I did touch them one time you see but of course there was nothing doing he wan me! Some years afterwards walking down here after he'd been his for his silver wedding, golden wedding and so on er, coming down that dri drift down from the back he looked at me he said I don't know boy! I got a nice bit of money and such like I don't know who to leave it to. I said, well I don't want it . I'd got on my feet you see Yes, that's right. Yes. Mhm. That was good. He never forgot that! Is that so? On two occasions he , repeated me that like that. Mm mm. He used to come over here. He went off and told his gardener, Wilfred he said Stanley won't have any. That was a surprise to him! Mm. Good on you! But I hadn't got much but I'd got on my feet. That's right, and you didn't need anybody else's! And I thought to myself, keep it boy! Yes. Yes. I told him . Yes. Yes. But otherwise said I could have it, he would of left that to me. Mhm. Mhm. Cos he always over here! Yes. Always over here. Yes. But that was the biggest shock he ever had! That you didn't want it. That was. And Mhm. thought to myself, yes in a sense I could of done with that so far but I thought, no, I'll stick up and Yes your independence stand on my own legs! So I told means a lot. him. Ha. I told him. Yes. And he Yes. and Wilfred told me himself when I went up there! Really? Aha. Yes , he told me what said to him. Yes. It all comes round. Oh yes! And it's done you no harm It always comes round! has it Stanley? Pardon? It's done you no harm to stand on your own feet has it? No, it hasn't! No. No, it No. hasn't. No. That's the way. If only people would be a bit more like that sometimes today. What I wa , what I want to get I've saved up an ,an an an an earned it and Yes. Lily and I like that and we bought the self and we felt independent. That's right. And I've always was a little bit independent. Yes. Oh it's the best way to be Stanley. Yes! It's the best way to be. Aha. And a fellow said to me about two ye , two to three years ago I expect it was two telegraph people up that pole out an just outside of my gate and he's still there and I walk along the gate and he turned round to me he say you're a lucky man! I said what do you mean,yo , me a lucky man? Well he said, living in a nice place like this. You call it luck? I said, when I earned a pound I spent nineteen and sixpence, not a guinea like some of you! Right . And he never said no more. That's right. No. Ah, they caught them. That's right. Two people come now doing the water, the the stop cap and one fellow looked across coo he said a big , I said I'll have a run a over the left I said, now you wouldn't would you? Cos I don't mind, I lo I thi , I'm not afraid of work. No. No. Jolly good! They're the sort of people you get. That's right! Absolutely! Yes. I I don't know, by the way, there ar , your gate is open and there is a er, red van out there. I opened it. They do, oh! Th , oh for me did you? Yes. Ah, that's sweet of you! So when I go you'd like me to shut it probably would you? Well i i if you don't mind? If not I can shut it. Oh no! Well it doesn't take me a minute. I just wondered whether it was because the erm men with the red van at the gate there Oh no no the are doing something here. No,no! Cos I They're working are they? I knew you were coming and so I went and opened the gate. Ah, so you did. That's sweet of you! I thought That's kind! Stanley I do not You know erm yeah? Pardon? That take all sorts to make a world you know. Oh yes , indeed it does! Oh it Yep. does! And we've got them too, Stanley! We've got them! A lot of people I think we've got all sorts! now like this. Well George come the other day, now he's a working fellow! Mm. He's got a little sense! Mm. He earned a lot of money and he save it, he then bought a British car. Mm, yes. He paid for it! Mm. That's the sor he say, nobody need go short today! That's true. Mm. Other people what do they do? They take the money they go and buy videos, they buy records, they go and bu ba for fo football and all si Mhm. they spend the money in the wrong direction! There's no return! No. That's right Stanley. And then they It's say they're short! Yes. That's what you've been saying all the time this sort of bank lending's been going on haven't you? Yes! Mm. Yes! It's madness really! Ooh yes! And then Mhm. th a th th I mean th , all these repossessed houses they're lived far beyond their end zone! Yes , they do. They're ordinary working people, they wanna be independent gentlemen! That's right. And the banks and building societies have encouraged them! They have, I'm afraid, they have! Pushed the money onto them! And now of course they're paying the price too because Course! they're in a mess! It's their own fault! Absolutely! As you make your bed you lie on it! That's right. That's as simple as that! After all said and done, people live It is really. far beyond their income and when they get the money they spend it in the wrong direction That's right, because they haven't haven't they? had to work so hard for it perhaps, you see. No! They've borrowed You see it instead. you see go to a football match, or buying some er electrical appliance appeal to them far more than paying the rent! Yes, that's right. But a lot of people They don't pay the rent, no, ah ra , the tax payers have to make that up! That's true in many cases that's true. They've got swelled heads, people have! Yes , they have Stanley. It's very foolish! I wonder if anybody would know that what happened here ah er er two or three year ago was a up till re recently they know very well that couldn't last! Couldn't last, could it? Couldn't last! I know, It wasn't reality. went and borrowed an eighty thousand pound and bought a house That's right. Mhm. well, he had to scrape to pay the rent at all! Then, on the other hand he had to go short indoors, well then when the I er th th ,th er the interest went up, cos he ! They don't work out how much they're paying for their money No, they don't! do they? No. They go to silly people like It is really! that! Is really. And the first thing they do th they go to the wo er er bo the boss of the firm where they work for and want more money! That's right. They can't manage. We couldn't do that! What do you Mhm. think we are! Yes . They, and and they they've they've on the ba ba had their unions run the blessed country! Well they did. Certainly, they did. I sa And they will again, Stanley! I said If we get the wrong people in. that Jackie will tell you the same, I told her mother anything from thirty to forty years ago I said, that don't matter some toss what political power they get in power you'll find the unions will run the country Yes. the way they're going on! Yes. They demand things! Yes. If, for argument's sake, they want fifty pound, they demand sixty! That's right. That's right. And they know they'll get something. That's right. Well Mhm. all that money that they keep demanding from the er th wa th wa the firms and such like that ought to have been ploughed back into the firm! That's right. That's right Stanley. If they robbed the firm, they're robbing themselves! Yes, and then they are. Anthony said years ago, when the rail ma men went on strike why do it? You'll only bring misery and distress on your own country! Absolutely! And that's as true today! Yes. It is! But they can't see it! All of them around they kill the goose that laid the golden egg. Well that's the trouble, they do! Yes. Yes, but then They do. these firms are gonna pack up! Exactly! Exactly, and then they lose the lot then don't they? there's only one thought for th sa for them and that's for theirse I got erm Patsy coming in for a bite of lunch Oh yes. erm because we didn't see her last week. Yes. Well we And we better get the sweeper sometimes then. Oh you need to Stanley won't you? Because er I can't bear to think of you without this room with that lovely fire in. Well, there you are. There's always some, look at my birds! Oh yes, the birds are there still aren't they? Here's some fat for them. That's your medicine Stanley. Just a minute. Come on sweetheart. Aren't they marvellous! They come straight away don't they? Yeah. They're wonderful! That's your medicine there your eggs there. The instructions on them I suppose? Sorry? The instructions on it are Oh they? Oh, it says, Stanley well you can read it I'm sure. Please repeat the water test when you've finished the tablets. Please what? Repeat the water test Oh yeah. when you've finished the tablets. Repeat? Yes. Ah! That's Yes. the word I wanted. After you've taken those. Righto! I expect they'll tell you how many to take. I sho , I suppose so. Can I just check? I'm sure they will. Yes, you look , you look at them. I'm sure they will Stanley. You look at them. Whoops! Yes, that one's two tablets twice a day and that's for the water test. I see. Alright? So I gotta take them both? What Er are they for? bu , you take that to , er two tablets twice a day that's it. Two tablets twice a day. So that's probably Yes, well what are these? morning and evening. They are perhaps new ones, I don't know. Are they? I dunno, I'll take them but Yes. Two twice a day. Yes. And then this is for your water test. Right. And er, what When those are finished. When those are finished? Yes. That's just to put the water in to put your urine in you see. Let me see it before, ooh I mustn't open it because it'll be ste Oh no! it'll be sterile, you see. It is, it's Ooh he want, he want that for a test? He wants that,yo , he wants you to put some water in that for a test, some of your water in that That's right. Fine. for a test after I've used them? After you've used those. That's alright. And Stanley, we don't open that in the meantime because No, no! it's sterile. Yes. And so it must be for your test, you see? Yes , quite. Okay? So after I've finished those lot twice a day Yes. Well they're the Two twice a day. Two twice a day. Yes. Well that's four a day. It is. Then er, put some urine in there Yes. and let him have it. That's right! That's it. Well I can send it down with anybody. That's right. Oh yes, well er er, yes you can because you need to send it down when it's fresh. Oh yes! Er, so if nobody's going down give me a ring and I'll come and get it. Thank you. Alright? Thank you. So erm Yes. your fat, what I might get the old lady to go down for me. Well er, only if she's going. If she's going. Yes. That's right. If she's going. There's the fat Stanley. How much do you want? It's one twenty nine please. One twenty did you say? Er, one twenty nine Stanley. Please. Twenty If you've got a ten, I've got a one. I got, I've got one . Twenty five Ah. six, seven eight, nine. Good! That's clever. That's right. You almost always have change don't you? Pardon? Almost always have the right change. Yes. Yes. Try to. Yes. Try to. Try to. There. Thank you very much. You're very welcome Stanley. And I'll see you again next week, but if you need anything in the meantime give me a ring will you? I will, thank you very much. Do that dear. Thank you. And, try to keep warm and keep out of this wind. Yes, that's right. Bye bye dear! That's right. And I'll shut the gate. Alright. Okay, so you tha , you don't need to come out at all. There we are. Oh the wind is still cold! It's keen! It's keen, indeed! Yes it is. Yes. Right. Bye bye then Stanley! Bye bye! Bye bye! erm I think it can't be bad for you because you do quite a lot of the same exercise as you'd do in proper aerobics Yes. but you're in the water the whole time. I don't even know what proper aerobics are anyhow. Oh you just keep moving the whole time. Running on the spot and waving your arms about Just seem to keep moving all the time without even running on the spot. Yeah well this is, this is you know it's very difficult to run in the water I know it is. cos it keeps getting round your feet and sort of making you drop over. Yeah. And I suppose developing the muscles that keep you from dropping over it's pro can't be, can't be a bad thing. I suppose it can't, no. I And then you do other exercises like lying on your back, putting your feet your from the knees downwards over the edge of the pool and then trying to do sit ups. Good heavens! I'm too old for any of that. But Noel, isn't exercise against resistance is supposed to have some special benefit isn't it? Well I'm doing that all the time, I'm doing it with you my love. Oh come off it. Erm I don't know, I, I, I, I I just feel that this is that sort of exercise where er Ooh sorry. it only lasts an hour, it's not going to do any harm No I'm sure it isn't. it's erm a good thing to be doing. Because swimming's I think something that does do harm is jogging. Yeah well Well yes that's a beast. I, I did a little jog this morning with the dogs cos it was too cold to walk. Oh Ah yes. And I've got another one this afternoon I think. Have you ever been in the sauna at er Woodbridge? No I haven't. Er er no I haven't either. Er I one, went into one at Iceland that was it was lovely. I've been in a sauna in London I belong to a health club there. Mm. I used to play squash. Mm. That's a violent one isn't it, squash? Yes. I, I can't think that really violent exercise is a good thing generally is it? Something that's more measured Oh I don't think I don't think it hurts when you're young, I think when you're older you should only do it if you've done warming up first. I think so too probably, and you've been used to it. That let's us off, isn't it nice? I think the warming up exercises in themselves are a good thing though Mm. even if you don't do anything after Mm. after warming up. The class I go to on Monday evenings erm we do warming up exercises and I'd be quite happy if they just stayed warming up exercises for the whole hour. Yes. Have you got someone properly qualified taking them? Yes, she's very good. Mm. I went to a sauna in Iceland Mm? and then was able to straight, in, in the hotel it was Yes. straight up in the lift to my bedroom and it was lovely you know, yeah in the hot, in the swimming pa pool Mm. or through the shower then in the swimming pool then back again and when I'd finished with it I went straight upstairs to my room and I went to sleep straight away, it was lovely. I was waiting for him to say he went out and rolled in the snow because that's the proper end isn't it? Mm and you should beat yourself with twigs as well. I'm not I don't know really about that. Oh you should definitely do that, I mean That borders on the nasty I think. They had a there was a sort of electric burner in the place as a whole Mm. where they kept on throwing on Water to water with some erm sort of fir smelling in it. Oh yes, it made steam. Mm. Fine mm. That's it. I should apologize for canned soup, but I spent so long talking to Stanley this morning Mm? you know sometimes you can just tell he wants you to talk to him, and erm so I er couldn't make a proper soup, sorry, but this is I think good actually I think. Yes, which is it? Is it Heinz? Heinz tomato I I made some stock the other day Mhm. and I put some of it in the freezer Yes, ideal. in erm sort of bowls. What did you use for your stock? Some bones. And? Oh some onions and Carrot? carrot, yes. Celery? That gives a lovely flavour. I don't think I had any celery, I had, I had put in whatever I had in the house and sort of various herbs and spices and things. Did you put the bones in the stock before or after the dogs had had them? During? During The dogs went into it instead. Think what a luscious stock the dogs would make. No they wouldn't. Mhm. Erm All that hair. Yuk. erm no what happened was that he gave me some bones that were far too big for the dogs. So I made stock out of those. Where they gorgeous marrow bones? That Yes. Oh yes, they make wonderful stock don't they? Mm. Well normally when he gives marrow bones I ask him to chop them up a bit smaller Mm. but he gave them to me practically Mm. He's an obliging chap isn't he? Mm. I always feel that when he's giving,, because he gives them to one, doesn't charge for any Mm? er anything for the bones, one can hardly say erm give that another whack across the knuckle because He wouldn't the big knuckle has so much locked inside He wouldn't mind. it doesn't it? I do. Do you? Yes. I should really. He wouldn't mind. I ought to have courage. He charges high enough prices for his other things. Yes he, you're right, mhm. Erm when you do your stock do you first of all roast the bone? No but that is erm er a counsel of perfection or something isn't it? It it's a method anyway. Mm. Erm do you? No. Well I didn't because I just couldn't be bothered to put the oven on to get as hot as that for such short period of time. What in fact does it do? Oh I should think it erm melts out the marrow and does all sorts of quite good things for it. It probably gives it a good colour too. It gives it colour erm I'm sure because of the, of the fact that they're roasted. There's one thing that erm I sometimes do to give it colour, is once I've taken off the outside skin of the onion, the very outside Mm? I put the next one in. Mm? Does that, that gives it colour does it? I read that somewhere, mm. Mm. But roasting them, I wouldn't like to get them with any sort of burnt taste. Well I don't think it would give a burnt taste but I think, I think it probably could do quite a lot of good for it. Mm. Er I just read it in er I was reading Delia. Mm, yes. Oh yes she's good. And she tells you to do that does she? Yes. It's the matter of the moment really, you just fling them into a roasting tin don't you and put it in the oven? And that's alright if you've got a Rayburn but otherwise you have to start Yes, start from scratch. heating it up, mm. Now when I was away staying with my cousins Mm. he is a G P in High Wycombe and he's a fundholder. Oh good, tell me about it. Well he's also been on hundreds of committees because they were sort of one of the early ones to be done Mm. and they have a battery of sort of board members drawn from here there and everywhere, including a fair quantity of redundanted service people. Oh. They had an S A S officer running, running them Is that to get you ri to get rid of the patients he didn't want ? No, it was to get rid of the Health Service. He, he, he said that at one point this chap had used the phrase that well that they were going for controlled destabilization from the Health Service. Controlled what? Destabilization. Oh. The S A S man was? Mm. Why? That's what the aim of the people doing it was. You mean the official government line? Mm or that's what they er or maybe that was his interpretation of it anyway this was a phrase that came out in, in the actual meetings. And then he told me a hilarious story about the way in which the chairman of the committee, I'm not sure quite what particular branch in the world he'd come from but he was looking at the figures, I suppose it was an accountant looking at the, the figures saying now why is it that the amount spent on district nurses has gone up? So he was told petrol has gone up. He said yes but you now have your health centre and the district nurses work from there. So erm they all looked at him, you know, the district nurses so John said to this man what there are some of our patients who are housebound Yes. and some of them as well as being housebound, maybe aren't very well and are bedbound Mm and the district nurses visit them in their homes. He had to explain it to this man. Good god. Where did he fund this committee from one has to ask immediately. he's not given his committee it's wished on him. The local authority the local authority creates the committee. But I, I had no idea that he then had to be that, being given his own funding, he then had to be organized by a committee. Oh that's outrageous. Local council I think it must have been some sort of Yeah. thing like that, I don't know. Well it doesn't seem sensible, I thought it was the G Ps getting control. I mean this is what's going to happen to the detriment of the health service right through Yes. administration by people who don't know what it's all about. That's right. what has happened to a lot of these hospitals hasn't it? Well it seems to be still going on. What do you make of this idea of building a new hospital at Norwich with fewer beds? I can't understand it because if they've got fewer beds why don't they, they just hide a few of the beds they've got already? Absolutely. Mm why do they have to have a green field site and start again? Is it because they're going to incorporate a lot of high tech treatments? I think so, yes. Mm and, you see erm it is a fact that they need fewer hospital beds nowadays because Mm. the, the hospital stays are dramatically shorter than they were. Mm yes but we're coming up to a time when er the quantity of old people is going to be rather high than before because we're all healthier. Mm. Mm. They'll have something special for them like concentration camps. I know. Th they've got those in Ipswich already haven't they? That's what they've made the old Anglesey Road hospital into. Is that so? Mm something like that. I wonder how it really goes. I wonder I don't know. Erm well it's Oh this is disappointing because I thought that with G P who'll knows what he requires and what his patients require was going to have erm a pretty er erm Well you can't leave a G P to spend the money like he likes, you've got to have a committee for it. You think about it. You, you know? Ah! Ah. Yes anyway have you heard about how they do the costing? Will was telling me about it, how how how they Oh do tell me because I how they cost erm something like a tonsillectomy. Mm. And how do they? Well apparently they count the procedures that are involved in doing it Mm? erm they have a price per procedure Yes? and they tot it up. Mm. But they haven't got it quantified to such a point where they can actually distinguish a tonsillectomy which might have a lot of procedures but actually takes about half a minute with er other things that are, you know, much much more complicated and the cost of tonsillectomies is unreasonably high compared with erm, you know, with Yes. Really? Mm. They haven't, they haven't got the pricing right. And I can understand them not having the pricing right, I don't think they've spent long enough working out what the prices of things are. They've dearly gone on for years not knowing, let alone tonsillectomies, what Yes, they didn't these wretched erm they didn't know transplants costs. they didn't know what they cost but equally being asked to budget against not knowing what things cost Mm mm is er equally stupid. Yes it is. Because er er ya absol But then, but then the er the whole thing gets knocked for six anyway because of general unpredictableness of, of, of illness. Well it does I suppose. It does. You can you can apply statistics to it a bit but it's very unlikely the statis st statistics and what really happens will always add up in fact. They, they've suddenly had a few outbreaks of polio haven't they? Oh have they? Mm. I didn't hear that. I say. Mhm. Yep. They've had the odd child who hasn't been erm whatnotted and some various Ah! various men seem to have caught it from changing their nappies. Yes! I did hear of that. I'm sorry I wasn't relating it to erm to polio. Mm. Erm Well you know, you've only got to get maybe smallpox back again and that will knock all their predictions for six. Erm They say they've wiped smallpox off the face of the earth. Yes they do you see. That's the doubtful one isn't it, because it's gone. It's supposed to be completely gone. Yeah but do they, do they inoculate children against it at all? No I don't think no I don't think we have smallpox inoculation er of, of children do we? Don't know we I mean we used to Because they say it's it's, it's gone completely. Erm sorry love we need a fork for that. Perhaps the meat fork from the shop would do nicely. No er er erm it's all in the cutting, of course it is very no that's pork and Noel daren't touch it so I've got two slices so that you and I could have one. That's very nice, thank you. And Noel will have the other. Erm I haven't had any pork for ages. it's so new to them that they're bothering to cost it, but how did we go on in the older days? I'm trying to think. Did we know anything about what our operations were costing? I can't remember. Well if y you if if you go to a BUPA hospital you go pa you pay a sort of erm, you know, related type of Yes a figure that's been around that anyway, yes. Mm? Ya. But I don't know I'm just having that to start with I think . erm I do I don't, I mean I don't know how accurate it is or whether it's sort of, you know, a set of figures they decided to put on. It wouldn't relate to what it costs to keep to keep to keep their profits going. Yes, that's right. Well it probably does relate That's what it that'll be it. it probably does relate pretty well. I bet it doesn't relate to an actual operation in a general hospital because you've got so many people wanting their rake off in a private one surely? I mean haven't you? Yes. Yes. That erm Yes their profit Ya that's right. rather tired bit fed up with private medicine at the moment. Oh because of Richard? I'm convinced that Richard you know Richard er er ? Mm? Had he gone to a National Health hospital Mm. with the request to have that back thing done for him Mhm. I'm convinced that at the age of seventy eight people do they would have said don't bother. Yes I'm sure they would have done. Ya. And er would have erm perceived that he wasn't greatly hampered by it, but once you've got a surgeon who is going to get a fat fee he did say to him are you sure you want this done Mm. but Richard was sure he wanted it done and nothing came between him and that intention. And you see he's, it's going to finish him. He's not going to get better. No. Erm but did he tol tell you that the surgeon asked him if he really wanted it done? Oh yes it's known that he did. Mm? He said er you're sure because it was quite a thought, for a man his age. Mm. But I think a surgeon in a National Health would have said look here I do not recommend this. Yeah but then the first thing he would have done would have been got up and gone off and got it done privately. That is the danger. He would. So er the end was I suppose always connectable. Ya. If that's, if that's what private will do for you Mm. Mm. I mean, I think, I hadn't realized that they would make different decisions on medical grounds. Mm they will, it's more permissive if you're in the private sector. I'm sure of that. It doesn't come so hea heavily loaded with advice against things. What, because it's all too good for the moneybags? Yes it's, it's I suppose human nature to want to pursue your craft wherever you can. Mm. But erm but it's been a very bad thing for him. Yes. But you see they've had computers in hospitals now for years Mm? and are, are employing and paying people to work them but they don't ever seem to come to any let's say reportable conclusion about the cost of operations. I think if we knew what those heart and lung transplants cost, people would be up in arms that the National Health Service is being expected to fund that. Mm. Well y they're a little bit like nuclear electricity in terms of erm the expensive end aren't they? Mm. Mm. Yes I suppose that's so. I wish the government could really tellingly er do down these dreadful lies and scandal erm scaremongering things that the Labour opposition is putting forward. I mean they don't honestly care two hoots about people, if they can talk about the dreadful state the, the care of old people is in and all the rest of it and that it's going to get worse, frightening old people. That's not caring for the community at all. That's just erm politicking isn't it? Yes. I can think of nothing worse than Kinnock coming into power. Oh! Imagine how people like erm erm Helmut Kohl and Cook? Not Cook Oh. because he's in his own party, I mean Cook yes well he's a snidey little thing, I'm talking about the erm ambassadors and the politicians, the ministers who would be Oh yes, oh lord yes. you know, opposing him. Yes. They'd just, they'd just run over him absolutely, whilst he was grinning. One can't see him in an ambassadorial role at all can one? No. It may not come to it. But this recession is quite a problem. Oh it must be. It's a worldwide thing though. Mm. Yes but the trouble about it is that the English are so insular that lots of them don't, don't realize it or won't believe it. No. That's true. They, they regard that as an excuse. Mm. Have some more chutney, it was given to us by our German daughter-in-law. Oh So it will be perfect. Did she make it herself? She did. Goodness. It was our Christmas present wasn't it? I forget what it was, was it her present? Mm. Well has it been nice not having to go to France? Mm. Except of having to go to London instead. Mm I couldn't tell how many people would agree with you about that one that London could be at least a bit preferable to Paris. Well Helen's a bit like you she, she sort of perks up when she starts to smell the petrol fumes Mm! Ya. And she said she had a lovely time. She went to an exhibition, she went for a browsing sort of shop. She said the shops were empty. Mm. Shopping is much more comfortable now. Mm. I'd better go and try and do some some time. Mm. There's a lovely suit in at the moment in the sale in what's that place called? ? Near Mhm. it's really lovely. Smart, one could go to town or anywhere in it. Mm. Why is it you don't buy it then? Well because it's darkish in colour and I'd rather promised myself that if I have anything new now it'll be of a brighter colour. Oh well go and buy the thing before somebody else does, go up this afternoon. Dearest I'm saying it's a dark colour. Yes. Yeah but you could wear it with, you could wear bright things with it. Mm. Shush, don't push me, I don't need pushing. No no really I, I, I've resolved, it's charcoal grey you see It sounds very smart Enid. Very smart. We're going to have Princess Diana. My size too. Is it? Mm. It's got your name written on it. Mm. Why don't you go up and buy the thing? No. I'll phone her and ask her if she's got it in red. You can pinch a bit more of my er Like the telephone woman. Mm? Like the telephone woman. Oh er isn't she oh isn't she super? I don't like the advertisements they're doing for the telephone now though. Which are they? Oh they have this silly man who picks up the telephone in a he's er got a chef's hat on and he says Giovanni's and then it was, it turns out to be one of his old friends so he lapses into sort of Glaswegian. Oh no! I haven't heard that one. Oh but Maureen erm er what's she called? Maureen Lipman, yes Lipman, Lipman. is very good on those isn't she? Mm. She's the right sort. Erm the thing that I feel I couldn't go to see her in is erm Hello Joyce. Yes, that Joyce Grenfell thing? Mm. A bit of it was on the television. Yes, I saw that bit and it wasn't good No. because sh Joyce Grenfell was such a lady, it came through. And and wh and er Maureen Lipman is much more earthy Mm. and that came through and it was no good. If you've seen Joyce Grenfell you, you couldn't Funny thing to put No. a Jewess to to try to represent Joyce Grenfell anyhow isn't it? Yes. Yes in a way, except she well you could do, it could be done. Did you feel that about her on television? Well I felt, I just didn't know what it was but it lacked the sort of charm that it had before. Mm. Completely. Almost thought when she, when it was when it was erm er mentioned in the first place that she was going to do it Mhm. I almost thought ooh you know I'd love to write and say oh don't, don't. Joyce Grenfell was such a lady. You couldn't say that to her cos she didn't it would be insulting but in fact, that's the big difference. Mm. Talking of things like this, you know er some people have postcards with their name on in black, across the top Oh yes they do. Yes that's right, they do. Mm. Well er all sorts of funny people like have them like erm Iris has, has them. Oh does she? And does Jane . Yes. Yes she has them Mm. my aunt has them, my father used to have them. Mm. and so I've always associated them with sort of erm, you know, what people had before all those sticky labels came Mm yes. People who did things properly? Mm. Mm. Well when I was in the London office one chap who is an east end Jew made good, his name is Ralph , erm suddenly gasped and said gosh isn't this wonderful? So I sort of was called to look at it, and I said oh yes, all the people I know who have got those are over seventy. And was it one of his own? No no, someone had sent it to him. Somebody had sent to him. And he, he thought that it was such a touch of class about it. Mm. Mm. And I expect he's gone away to get them printed now Oh probably. because I s I said, I said How funny . I said well they're just what people had before the sticky labels. Yes. And he dragged out his sticky labels which, which had got blue stripes on them No? Yes, I thought No that wasn't terribly elegant but anyway his blue labels had got, these little sticky labels had got blue stripes on them top and bottom. Oh how funny. Erm and so I guess he's gone away to get some made. Mm And I said and of course to do it really properly, you also have envelopes so that if you want to you can stick, stick the card in an envelope that will Yes. fit it. Cos that's what we used to have. Mm. Oh yes it wouldn't go naked through the post would it? Well you can yes you can't Mm you know, you could use it for quick notes Mm. to drop on people's doorsteps Yes. or, or Which is useful. Yes. Or if you just want to sort of signify a, a quick thank you to someone. Mm yes. Or a quick come Yes I hadn't thought about that. Mm mm they're they are very useful, I've often thought of having some made Mm. because, in fact every time I get one from someone else I always think why haven't I gone and got some of those yet? I know why, because you're not seventy. That's right, give me another twenty years. We had those envelopes er and the cards for our concerts. Well they were probably erm invitation to a concert. Yeah but they were all fixed up to go into the same envelope sort of thing. Mm. Yes Oh yes you can't , can't use them though. No. Got too much detail of where we lived and erm you know that it was a concert. But but these you know, you had your telephone number and you know, just had a whole statement of everything about you. Mm mm. And And all you needed was the brief message that you had to send. Yes. And it saved you hav it saved you having to do the preliminary thing of saying dear whoever you are Of course, that's right. That's right. which was sometimes quite a difficult thing to do. Well on a personal card you're not supposed to put dear anybody are you so I know but that does make it difficult. No it made it very easy. You know, especially when perhaps you were having a mixed sort of meeting Mm. wh I remember that when I was at home it was a mixed sort of meeting in which some of the people from the village were coming who you didn't really know but they had to be asked Mm. Mm. Yes. well you I mean you, you could cover er cover the whole thing couldn't you? Mm mm. Without saying dear so and so. Yes. Mm. And without really having to sign it. You could just put your initial in the corner. Of course. Mm that's right it Are they called gentle Yes cards? Something like that, yes . safe distance cards. I must go and get some made. indeed. Oh gosh. Have you used any of these erm things called Post It? Oh yes they, they use them a lot at work. Th but they're useful? What are they? Well er they're er like your autumn leaves that you used to leave on everybody's benches Oh did I? erm but they've got a sticky bit on them Oh I know, yes. and so you, you'd have stuck it on the bench you see erm and it comes off anything without making a mark on Oh yes we've got a little pack of them in London I think on the, by the telephone. Yes. That's right, some teeny weeny ones? Yes. Mm Folly gave them to you? They they they used to call them my autumn leaves er erm Patsy and more Oh have some more an another piece of ham, do have some more ham or you're getting some nice cheese in a minute. Oh cheese. are we having some cheese? Mm. Well I think I'll wait for some cheese Mm. Ye yes I used to leave notes I'm I'm tr I'm tr I'm trying not to overeat you see? Yes. Right. Please yourself. I'm trying to avoid being noticed if I overeat. You're trying to, you're trying to avoid being starved all the time aren't you darling? You're allowed to have some water aren't you ? No no no no no It's difficult for you but he's trying to avoid being starved. Will that plate do? It'll be fine. dish you out a larger one. No no it will be absolutely fine, thank you. Okay. Well help yourself, I can recommend cheese. Well autumn leave is the best way out of, of of er communicating. If I were to turn to a man on a bench Mm. and say to him so and so and so and so he'd always answer back and say I want to do it this way Mhm. and er the time was wasted, but you give an autumn leaf a little note saying what it, what you, what you wanted done there wasn't much chance he could argue. Yes I heard a very interesting conversation on the way down here in that programme Just a Minute Oh you know the one I mean? I hate it but I'll tell you why in a minute. Mm mm. Go on. Well I don't like it very much but it has this very interesting discussion as to whether a fax was cheaper or more expensive than the telephone Mm? and the biggest pro for a fax that I can think of is that you can send the message and that's that, there's no risk of it dribbling on into, into doubt Mm As it would on the telephone, yes. Yes. How right. Mm. So I thought that was quite interesting to think Mm and they can't argue with a fax. think about. I hate that programme because I like I tend to come and listen to the content of what they're saying Mm. and they're only saying it for the sake of keeping going. Yes And then er so it's never, it's never worth serious attention is it? Well just occasionally it is. Sometimes you do get something interesting. And and and and then and then they get interrupted and you wish, you know, you wish they hadn't. That's it, you see that's full of frustration Yes it's for me I don't like it, I, I prefer things like the news quiz Mm. or even that one about that game with Mornington Crescent in it. Mornington Crescent? Yes. I've heard that phrase used but I don't know what it's for. Oh well it's, it's where they say say a sequence of underground station names or or locations Oh in London in, in a sort of clever way that makes it sound as though there's some terrific good reasoning for it Oh. and they just say it totally randomly and the last one just the first pers person who says Mornington Crescent is the winner but they've made a great big sort of fiction as to how why, when it is suitable to say Mornington Crescent You have to come to it Yes. I, yes I see. Th there's no logic to it at all but they play it on. How extraordinary, I've not heard that one. Mhm. It's a programme where they also sing the songs of one tune wh to another tune. Oh you mean the programme where they do that? Mm. Erm well that's not that's not My Music is it? No. No. Erm That's erm can't remember what it's called. Mm it's Jazz With Humphrey Littleton. Oh. I, I'm, I'm not with you on that one because erm I'm sure I'm vaguely at the back of my mind I think I know what it is, I have heard of it I mean Mm. or heard it Mm. but I can't bring it to mind, it won't come to the front as it were. Well I can't remember what it's called. Erm yes apart from My Music I can't think of one. I heard a very amusing thing on the radio this morning Mm? came in half way through it, at least half way erm but it was so obviously the voice of erm Freud, Clement Freud Mm. talking and he was telling about a visit he had paid to China for a whole week Mm. and how he'd seen prison and er they'd said they hadn't any prisons but he found one and erm hospitals and all that sort of thing and at the end of the week's visit erm one of the very high ups, whom he named and I've forgotten the name of him, I think I'll just use that, thank you erm sent for h he, he was brought before him as it were and the man said to him are there any questions er at the end of your week that you want to ask and he said well perhaps there is one he said erm Winston Churchill was here erm a month or two, a few months ago Mm. and he also, he like me stayed in the and he named the hotel in Mm. Peking he said can you tell me why his room was larger than mine Mm. and his room had three windows erm and I, mine only had two Mm. he said in spite of the fact that I've been in parliament for longer than he has, which surprised me cos I wouldn't have thought so this is the young Winston Churchill of course so the Chinese man said to him erm oh well the reason for that was that he had a famous grandfather and so Clement Freud said, not to him but now on this programme this morning, that's the first time I've ever been de-grandfathered That was rather nice wasn't it? Presumably his grandfather was Sigmund Freud was it? Yes. Mm. The Chinese didn't know. No I shouldn't think the Chinese have got much time for that sort of approach to life. I don't think they have either. I don't think they'd have been impressed even if he'd told them No. Erm did you see that th they're, they're going to look for some sort of gene called the Churchill factor? No. Well they want to find out why it is that someone who smoked so much and drank so much Mm! had to live so long. Yes. Well it's obvious. It's the same sort of factor that allows anybody who smokes a lot to not get cancer and not get bronchitis and live, also live a long time. There are plenty of them. Well that's true. I it's just a question of, you know, something in your make-up that is inoculating you and other people have a weakness. Well that's right. Other people go down with it. You can't really I should think find a gene surely that's There must be something though Enid. Mm there must be. His father was a very weak man wasn't he? Yes. His mother was a character but She was not nice. Not nice but she had a strong character. Mm. But his This reminds me Mm? might I just say this darling cos I've just remembered, I'll forget senile you see? Erm we have a video of the last programme of the Churchill series Mm? erm which a friend in London very kindly made for us because we were out with her, her mother Mm. and couldn't see it Mm. and erm Joan's video has gone wrong in some way Really? Yes, she doesn't know how to work it to begin with but she was working she was working on that, of course we don't know a thing about it, erm and the make, the erm the handyman chap came along and took a part away, it was faulty Mm. so we can't see it. Do you want to come and see it on mine? I was going, I'm getting round to that you see aren't I? Mhm. Erm we feel rather badly about not returning it to this person who made it for us Mm? because it's now a fortnight since we had it I think Mm. Well come and see it on mine. May we do that? Mm, sure. But when, that's not going to disturb you? Don't know. Erm let's think. Tomorrow morning? No. I'm taking, I'm going to London tomorrow afternoon, I Afternoon. I, no I've only just thought of it, I'd take it with me if, if we'd seen it. Mm. I've got to go out this evening. Yes. Well tomorrow, what happens to you tomorrow? Is it your lazy day when you Yes. Mm well we won't see it tom we'll keep it another week keep it another week I'll get my diary. I'll get my diary, can't talk without a diary. Okay. We can't do it next Saturday because erm we've got two people, a Scotsman married to a Chinese Yes. coming to spend Saturday. Mm. So that's a dead day for next week. And might be able to do it before the weekend perhaps Yeah think so, I'm just when does Noel get back from London? Erm hoping Monday evening. He's going to see Mr . He has a little bit of a scratchiness in one of his eyes Mm? erm and phoned up and sort of semi made an appointment, not exactly Mhm. erm because Mr was abroad and the girl said well I mean come in on Monday, when he'll be back Mm. and he may be able to see you then. Yeah. So come Monday morning, Sunday night in fact, Noel said gosh I can this is, this seems to have gone light. We've got some ointment from the doctor which didn't work last time he put it out Mm. and seems to have worked this time. So he said I can't go along and bother a busy man when it's feeling much better. Mm. So erm he didn't go Mm. but he got a phone call on the Tuesday from Mr 's secretary to say oh Mr would like to see you anyway because er he feels it may have erm it was a letter, I'm sorry, which came Mm. in case it has any bearing on any difficulty you might have in the future so he's to go down So he's got an appointment? Mm Monday morning. And then he's going to call at Sotherby's. Do you know Sotherby's are the most dilettante people you've ever come across, they really are. Mm. With the exception of the one erm section leader that he deals with normally. At the beginning of this week a girl phoned up and said that erm the chap he normally deals with is away Mm. but there's an organ is Sussex they want him to look at and erm so he said well send me a photograph er they've got a photograph of it you see Mm. send the photograph and that gives me an idea whether it's worth going to look at it at all. That I think was about Tuesday. Mhm. It never came. This is what they do, they phone up asking They could have they could have even faxed it. Mm well we haven't got a fax. Oh no. But the thing is, what they do tend to do is, they suddenly find themselves in a panic because they've behaved like this about it and the person at the other end is shouting when are you coming to see this organ Mm. I was talking about how dilatory S er Sotherby's are. Oh. Yes but I know the thing dear no Well of course they're not, they're not in a businesslike business are they? No not really, no. And I wonder if it seems to be that they prefer you come out of the upper drawer than come up with your brilliant A levels or whatever. They do, yes. Mm. Exactly that. Mm. They are erm a very, you know one, one of the last bastions where those sort of people can find a refuge. Yes. I suppose so. I find them You know,l like, like the Duke of Kent's daughter. Mm. Does she work there? She works in art galleries or, or some art gallery Or some art gallery. Yeah. Mm. And the man she's marrying is an art gallery. So he is. That's right. So he is. there has to be space for these people though somehow I always feel that they cream it all the same. Mm I think they do cream it, yes. Oh that's Well du during next week is what we think Noel. Pardon? During next week erm I'm just trying to think, I've got very heavy days on Monday and Tuesday so Wednesday's a possibility then in that case. Er let's shall, can we leave it open? Mhm, certainly. And then we'll arrange it with you, mm? Yes. Erm I don't know whether I think post rather erm er I see I'm not going to London after erm after this week Ooh. Oh you're going to be making some of your special coffee are you love? I am indeed. Ooh er How's your barn proceeding? Don't know, it doesn't seem to be doing anything and what the was that during the week when was in residence one night the dogs barked and he went out to see what was happening and there was a young man who worked in it this was in the pitch dark, was up there taking some of his stuff away. Oh. Oh. So I wonder. Has he run out of cash? Well, I wouldn't be surprised. Why would he need to do it in the dark? Well if for instance it's approaching receivership Oh oh oh you'd want to sort of, you know Mm. Oh yes. get your stuff and you'd want it not to be obvious that you'd got your stuff. Oh I see, yes. But that's, that's only a guess though I don't know. you mean the young man who actually owns it or the man who's employed working on it? Well I don't know who exactly owns it Yes. but the we came out isn't it lucky girl. She likes Polo? I like Polo. She's adores them I don't ha , I don't know if this is normal for a child this age to eat Polos, but Actually I like Polo I don't like other so erm I'm not really sure what does it like Polo mint. I want Polos now. You want, oh alright you can have one, just one. I don't know why I mean why I like Polo. They are nice, they're not too strong are they? There we are right you have those.

Alright little one. Oh this is mummy's hat. Who? So what was the problem on the journey then? Mummy Well we got to and there's three weeks well when we came up at the beginning of May there was a notice on the main main twenty one which said No they're done yet love. Okay. The tatties. long delays expected from May thirteenth for three weeks due to major resurfacing Hello. etcetera etcetera Hello. so You sleepy girl? we avoided the area Until today? and as we're right up towards the end and now after the bank holiday we've had lovely fine weather anyway, we got off to the main road and turned at Fibwell traffic lights onto the A twenty one and we got the to end of the dual carriageway onto the tail end of the queue as it started into the road works so I just went over the central reservation and went back down the dual carriageway to the traffic lights at Fibwell and turned right went through Tyse Tysehurst to Wothurst round the north side of Bule reservoir to come out at Lamberhurst in the village so I sort of circled it Oh right. which added another half an hour to the journey Oh well you got here but in the middle of all that of course there were numerous little bits of temporary traffic lights at roadworks which conspired to change when we approached them and generally it was a bitch of a journey Hee hee hee hee hee. I see your fork tha I see your fork. You've seen that before. Mm. You've seen that before. Oh was it upstairs? Yes.

Now, you see you're lucky that that he's, he's sort of over there And the other side's detached so and the other side detached, and how many kids have they got? Three three girls. Three girls, see you're lucky really cos if they'd had three boys an i , in a few times, you know, ten years time like, they'd have all, the boys would of been growing up and they'd have had cars stuck everywhere, you know what I mean? Yeah. Though with the girls, that's a bit more unlikely. Mm. I mean, I know it s sounds stupid but that's what you've gotta look for today. You look at your neighbours, see how many kids they got, see what age they are and work out what's it gonna be like in ten years time. Yeah. Like Billy were he lives, he lives on by the courts, you know by the Law Centre? Is that the one who you went to, his house? He gives me a lift to work. Yeah Yeah. Yeah.

One of the woman at work the other day. yeah, one of the woman at work she's a right stuck up old silly old bugger she is! She don't speak to nobody, she really does think she's above everybody ever such a funny woman! And where Carole lives out in Earlswood , down the lanes she lives round there as well. Well Carole's next door neighbour he owns a bit of land and he's got some sheep in his fields, and he's got some pigs and you know? Well, this woman her dog was scaring the sheep, so he shot it! Killed it! Which he's quite within his right to do, if it's scaring the sheep yeah. so, ooh there's been uproar about this bloody dog! And, I mean, we, we was on about it one day, and she was only sat on the table next to us, ooh she was giving us daggers! But I mean the chap was quite within his rights to shoot it cos it's been scaring his sheep. Well apparently her husband, he's been round smashing his windows and putting Oh! shit through the door and all sorts! There's really been a lot of trouble over it! I'd have shot him and all! Well, the police have been involved, and I suppose he's been cautioned now because they've investigated and found that thi that it was scaring the sheep and that, yes i , he was right to do what he did he quite within his rights and whatever. So they're not taking any action against the chap for shooting the dog but now they're, they're watching the other chap for causing disturbances!

Absolutely! That's right ! That's nice of them! Yes, absolutely ! Well that's right innit? Yes. Oh dear oh dear! Oh heck! Well, so there you are and I told them, he he said that he wanted erm a urine sample you see and so of course when the nurse come after he'd gone, later and I kept waiting and I thought to myself well I want to know the result! Yes. Jackie said, well ring them,sh he should know something about it! Yes. And that don't take a week, week to test anything like that! It shouldn't do, no. When it's gone to hospital.

Well why didn't he get on with it? People complain that these tests seem to take longer than they need to. Well I think so, yeah! Whether the hold up is at the hospital or in the erm surgery I Yes! honestly don't know! But it does seem to take a while. Oh dear oh dear! Oh what have I done? What? Oh! Oh it's just a You can't be Yes I can Stanley it's just a it's just an outdated bill. Is it? That's all, came out of my Well pocket. the thing is, after all's said and done if er,i i if there's a little pain I get it, not him! Absolutely! So he can hang on can't he? That's right! There's a no, I don't think he's too obliged as he should be! No, he's not a, I don't think he's as a as some They tell me that is a, is a, a lot better value. He is wonderful! They He say he's a nice little fellow! My gosh, he's wonderful! Everybody wants him you know. Yes. I should think his list is absolutely full by now. Yes, of course. Erm, the first time I met him was when he was doing a very tricky stitching job, I took Mollie up Yes. because she'd cut her leg Yes. and er I took her up there and her si , skin is like tissue paper Yes. I don't know how that man managed to get the two edges to meet but he did a wonderful job on it! And he was so nice to her when he was doing it. Yes, he's a nice person of You're very nice! then Mrs erm er,, you know, who had the mu Oh yes! she think a lot of him! Lucky girl! Yeah. Those people who live there in, up in Framlingham are very lucky! Ha? Yes. And those people who live near enough Yes. you see, to the main surgery. Well of course when is out, they they give you the the 's number That's right. in fact, one time when they was out they give me a number, I go , and I got ! Oh yes! Yes. Well and I had er er erm erm what's the name? Ha! What do you call them,? A tummy upset? No! Skin! Oh, not erm shingles? Shingles, I had a touch Oh! of shingles. Gosh! Mm. And I said to him, he said what's the matter? And I told him, I said I've got shingles so I said well I got them he said and red round the stomach. Ha, ha, ha, he said! I thought to myself, not so much of the ha, ha, ha! That's what he's li , er, wasn't a way to tell nobody was it? No, it wasn't. You see, that's another one. He didn't feel it did he? No, he didn't feel, absolutely No! Stanley! No, that's not I thought to myself, who's this then? That's something I don't sa , not so matter that I could have told him! Yes. That isn't a way to get through to people! No it isn't! No it's not. Cos after all, we don't go private but we're paying! Tha abs And I've payed for years and years for myself and four other people besides! Mm. Mm. No, some Yes. of them get too snooty in a way. Yes , they get, they're a bit less committed. I think the And, as you say with , well if he can go fishing and shooting, I don't know about that, they take priority! Yes. Yes, that's true. Mhm. There's another very nice one there, he's the latest to have come erm . What in oh and he's just at Framlingham? Yes. And he's very young, he's i , I met him twice, when I was with people who were dying Yes. and erm in fact, yes, but both of just had died and we sent for the doctor and it's Aha. it was he who came and erm he was absolutely marvellous! I thought his manner was just right. Makes all the difference doesn't it? Oh yes! It does make a lot of I mean difference, yes a person like that can help another person to get well can't they? They can! They can. I mean,th there is something to be said for the manner towards you isn't there? Ooh yes! Yes. Yes! That's true. I mean, when you look forward to seeing the doctor and one thing and another, and saying, have a conversation with them, that's a different story innit? That's true. And buck you up a bit. Oh absolutely! That's something you Absolutely! Yes! if you think to yourself well if I can have a a quarter of an hour's chat with him, that'd be worth something. That's right. That's true. Yes. I don't know why some of them get like that, well of course they shouldn't be doctors any how. And tha tha th th a doctor should have a nice personality! He should. I think in some cases, Stanley, not only in the me , medical profession the more people are paid the less committed they seem to be to the job! Yes, they do, they get independent! Yes. They begin to feel that the job is there so that they can earn a living, rather than that they are doing the job itself! That's right , yes. Yes. Mm. Th th er theirselves, they take priority not the patient! That's what I feel. Yes. Yes. I'm sorry about it because you know, how I feel about the medical profession and the nursing Yes. profession. Yes. Ye , I mean I'm passionately keen! But erm I I think some of them let us down a bit. Mm. Yes. Well there you are, I don't know whether it's wrong. Course, they drop onto you any old time if they come but if they can't Oh yes, if they want to come it doesn't matter if it's convenient to you or not does it ! Not a bit of it! Not a bit of it! Oh no That's true. not a bit of it. That's true. Well I mean after all they want er an appointment! Yes. But you don't get no appointment! That's right, you don't. Oh no! You see That's true. you take second place, definitely! Yes. I'm sorry Well it is true with some I mean, after all of them. you're, we're their customers! Ah, that's right! That's their living innit? That's right. Withou , they need er er anyone like ourselves, well, er er they'd have nothing to do! That's right. Absolutely! And of course they're not so hard pressed as people are in these big cities! Oh no! You know, they have a nicer time of it here altogether don't they? Oh undoubtedly! Undoubtedly! Yes. They do. Because, I mean, there you are, look, I mean for argument's sake, now , well they have e e every Tuesday off or some Monday or Tuesday off don't he? Mhm. He does. The same as that Doctor used to come down and er Oh yes! for him. Mm. He was quite a nice fellow! Mm. So far. Yes, he's in Debenham now. Debenham, yes. Mm. He lived on the green didn't he,? He did. Yes. Yes. Do he live at Debenham now? Er, I think he does live at Debenham. Yes. He , yeah. I know he operates from there anyway. Yeah. Right. Mm. Yes. But then I mean come and saw me once, you see, when I wasn't there like that and he he tested from top to bottom, he said well ar ar after we sit and talked, and like he said well I better give you the once over, I said th er, certainly. And so he he tested and such like and he shook his head and he said well I don't know, I can't find anything wrong with you. No. And he said you're a better man than I am! Really? Yeah. Aha. Yes. And that's what said, and that's what That's what the hospital said! Yes! Remember? Yes! And that is what er Doctor said! Yes. And ! Yes. I've had four doctors tell me I'm a better man than them! Well you wouldn't be ninety five if you were weakling would you Stanley? No I don't suppose so. I don't suppose so. Poor old Doctor , he said you'll never wear your heart out. Really? He said, whereas an ordinary man live till they're seventy you'll live till you're ninety! Fancy! He knew, you see. See an Yes. and and when er erm come over here the last time er, I I told him a a that he say, Doctor , you see, told what he said, he is a clever old boy weren't he? Yes. Well he was. said that! said that, yes, yes. Yes. Aha. And they don't often speak like that of one another. No, they don't often refer to one another do they? No they don't, that's right. You see it's not thought to be the thing That's right. to do. That's right. Ah! Yes. Oh he was a, he was a lovely man, wasn't he, Doctor ? Oh aye, I liked him, yeah. George liked him. Did he? Yes, yes, quite good. Yes. Yes, well of course they Yes, he ought used to be, he was in Scotland he wasn't bro , brought George . Did he? Oh yes, yes Yes. yes. Oh he was a real gentleman. Yes , no problem like that. Wonderful! Well George got on with a lot of people like that but of course, he was a Mason you see. Oh, was he? He is that, but that's why he kept them he used to go down there with him, he got a big photograph of Captain like that er, in his room here and so on. Aha. Well a man of nearly seventy years! Is that so? Yeah. My God! They had they had a few minutes silence for him when he died down Framlingham. Did they? Yes, they Did they? Because er er er Len a Mason you see. Is he? Yes. And he drives in London er er er for meeting! Does he really? They're very keen aren't they? Yes! Aha. Yes, David Some what's-a-name, er er said to me, have you ever thought about? I said I'm past that my dear! I'm past that . Noel's not keen on them, he's been asked to become a Mason sometimes Yes, right. but he just, it's not, somehow it's hi , not his sort of thing. No well erm, I did ask, old Chris spoke to me once in the park and then there's and things like that, cos a certain amount of secrecy in the , things like that and erm I I sort of turned it down and he even er er er well while and and Len that said Stanley did you ever think about joining the Masons? Well I said I'm too old for that now. Mhm. Mm. Well you've So they had plenty to do to fill your time without belonging to Well yes, after all's that sort of thing. said and done, mm, after all's said and done course I well I said there's good, bad, and indifferent everything cos I know some Masons who are blinking great rogues, you know! Mm. Mm. Yes! Mm. Old George used to be an old he was always keen to be executor for anybody you know. Really? Oh yes, and he could get executor, he was executor for one poor old lady old Mrs used to live on the causeway er er er, the first little house you know where the th th , er you're coming this way on the causeway there's The Elms, ain't they? That's right. And then on, at the back, there's a little cottage near the start there she used to live in that little cottage. Oh yes! Well old Jack er, he di used to do the post round and he lived in the next cottage Mm. they were two thick people. And the old lady when he was out like that, before and he used to go to Framlingham carrying the bags and such like, and then deliver, come back poor old boy! From the He had a little shop not much, you know just a few things and such like, in those days. Mhm. Well, she used to sort of keep shop for him, she was deaf as a post! Really? Yeah, she was deaf as a po ! But however, she us , poor old soul, she did her best well Jackie's mother used to go see her Mhm. and of course when old Jack died er, Jack he left things to her you see Oh yes. and that, which is natural. That was the time when there was a first portable radios come out Oh! Yes. er a Phillips I think, one, one of those portable ones, that was rather unique. And there was a draw tickets for it and old Jack won it!. Old Jack had won it! Well, old was doing the the executorship for them because he poked his nose into everything! Mhm. He used to live up at The Dial. And poor old Sarah said, well how much did she owe him you see? Well he said he'd take the radio. Oh good gracious! So he took the radio instead of, part payment you see, that was the first time. Well then, cos he was doing executor for poor old soul poor old and er Ivy used to go and see her pretty frequently, she said do come and see me Mrs ? Cos she got a little bit lonely. Mm. But of course,th , I'd been living at The Haven then, next to the butcher's shop. Go and see her. So one day she said to her Mrs , you haven't got a car have you? Ivy said no we haven't, she said you will have one day. Really? Mhm. If anything happened to me. Really? Aha. Judge, old was executor he went there one day and he got her to sign her will Goodness! Goodness! in favour of him! Oh well that's awful Stanley! That's a Mason! Yes, oh that's awful! Mm. When Ivy went he took clerk with them down at as a witness. When Ivy went to see her she said oh Mrs Mr came to see me yesterday afternoon he brought another gentleman with him, a nice gentleman so I she said I think they were taking the census, they got me to sign a paper. Oh dear! Oh! And she'd signed her own will! Oh! Dear oh dear! And so when she died, he swept the deck! Oh, that is dreadful! That's a Mason! Mm. Mm. That's dreadful! Yeah, that's a Mason! Mm. Now, there's another one. Old Mrs old lady who was in Framlingham, the dentist? No, I don't reme , no, I don't remember Well in any case that name. She, she come from Walthamstow. And then when her Ah yeah. her husband died she'd picked out a bit of land all this and I borrowed this and one thing and another, so well they never found a penny! Mhm. If we hadn't got the money to pay for cash on delivery I never want it! No. I done without! Mhm. Well we kept on like that and er er people like that we were packing up wholesale so erm I've lost myself a little bit now. No, you were talking about er about your cousin Mr . Oh yes, that's Yes. right! Yes, I was talking about he used to come over here a lot. Mm. Come over here and spent his silver wedding just to come here and his golden wedding! Mhm. He loved to come here take a slog and go down the meadows. Oh yes! That was his type. Aha. He he he er loved that! Mhm. And he loved a horse better than he would a Rolls Royce! Really? Yes Mm mm. he was that type of person. Yes. Well I knew someone in and I thought to myself I, perhaps he might lend me a hand? I did touch them one time you see but of course there was nothing doing he wan me! Some years afterwards walking down here after he'd been his for his silver wedding, golden wedding and so on er, coming down that dri drift down from the back he looked at me he said I don't know boy! I got a nice bit of money and such like I don't know who to leave it to. I said, well I don't want it . I'd got on my feet you see Yes, that's right. Yes. Mhm. That was good. He never forgot that! Is that so? On two occasions he , repeated me that like that. Mm mm. He used to come over here. He went off and told his gardener, Wilfred he said Stanley won't have any. That was a surprise to him! Mm. Good on you! But I hadn't got much but I'd got on my feet. That's right, and you didn't need anybody else's! And I thought to myself, keep it boy! Yes. Yes. I told him . Yes. Yes. But otherwise said I could have it, he would of left that to me. Mhm. Mhm. Cos he always over here! Yes. Always over here. Yes. But that was the biggest shock he ever had! That you didn't want it. That was. And Mhm. thought to myself, yes in a sense I could of done with that so far but I thought, no, I'll stick up and Yes your independence stand on my own legs! So I told means a lot. him. Ha. I told him. Yes. And he Yes. and Wilfred told me himself when I went up there! Really? Aha. Yes , he told me what said to him. Yes. It all comes round. Oh yes! And it's done you no harm It always comes round! has it Stanley? Pardon? It's done you no harm to stand on your own feet has it? No, it hasn't! No. No, it No. hasn't. No. That's the way. If only people would be a bit more like that sometimes today. What I wa , what I want to get I've saved up an ,an an an an earned it and Yes. Lily and I like that and we bought the self and we felt independent. That's right. And I've always was a little bit independent. Yes. Oh it's the best way to be Stanley. Yes! It's the best way to be. Aha. And a fellow said to me about two ye , two to three years ago I expect it was two telegraph people up that pole out an just outside of my gate and he's still there and I walk along the gate and he turned round to me he say you're a lucky man! I said what do you mean,yo , me a lucky man? Well he said, living in a nice place like this. You call it luck? I said, when I earned a pound I spent nineteen and sixpence, not a guinea like some of you! Right . And he never said no more. That's right. No. Ah, they caught them. That's right. Two people come now doing the water, the the stop cap and one fellow looked across coo he said a big , I said I'll have a run a over the left I said, now you wouldn't would you? Cos I don't mind, I lo I thi , I'm not afraid of work. No. No. Jolly good! They're the sort of people you get. That's right! Absolutely! Yes. I I don't know, by the way, there ar , your gate is open and there is a er, red van out there. I opened it. They do, oh! Th , oh for me did you? Yes. Ah, that's sweet of you! So when I go you'd like me to shut it probably would you? Well i i if you don't mind? If not I can shut it. Oh no! Well it doesn't take me a minute. I just wondered whether it was because the erm men with the red van at the gate there Oh no no the are doing something here. No,no! Cos I They're working are they? I knew you were coming and so I went and opened the gate. Ah, so you did. That's sweet of you! I thought That's kind! Stanley I do not You know erm yeah? Pardon? That take all sorts to make a world you know. Oh yes , indeed it does! Oh it Yep. does! And we've got them too, Stanley! We've got them! A lot of people I think we've got all sorts! now like this. Well George come the other day, now he's a working fellow! Mm. He's got a little sense! Mm. He earned a lot of money and he save it, he then bought a British car. Mm, yes. He paid for it! Mm. That's the sor he say, nobody need go short today! That's true. Mm. Other people what do they do? They take the money they go and buy videos, they buy records, they go and bu ba for fo football and all si Mhm. they spend the money in the wrong direction! There's no return! No. That's right Stanley. And then they It's say they're short! Yes. That's what you've been saying all the time this sort of bank lending's been going on haven't you? Yes! Mm. Yes! It's madness really! Ooh yes! And then Mhm. th a th th I mean th , all these repossessed houses they're lived far beyond their end zone! Yes , they do. They're ordinary working people, they wanna be independent gentlemen! That's right. And the banks and building societies have encouraged them! They have, I'm afraid, they have! Pushed the money onto them! And now of course they're paying the price too because Course! they're in a mess! It's their own fault! Absolutely! As you make your bed you lie on it! That's right. That's as simple as that! After all said and done, people live It is really. far beyond their income and when they get the money they spend it in the wrong direction That's right, because they haven't haven't they? had to work so hard for it perhaps, you see. No! They've borrowed You see it instead. you see go to a football match, or buying some er electrical appliance appeal to them far more than paying the rent! Yes, that's right. But a lot of people They don't pay the rent, no, ah ra , the tax payers have to make that up! That's true in many cases that's true. They've got swelled heads, people have! Yes , they have Stanley. It's very foolish! I wonder if anybody would know that what happened here ah er er two or three year ago was a up till re recently they know very well that couldn't last! Couldn't last, could it? Couldn't last! I know, It wasn't reality. went and borrowed an eighty thousand pound and bought a house That's right. Mhm. well, he had to scrape to pay the rent at all! Then, on the other hand he had to go short indoors, well then when the I er th th ,th er the interest went up, cos he ! They don't work out how much they're paying for their money No, they don't! do they? No. They go to silly people like It is really! that! Is really. And the first thing they do th they go to the wo er er bo the boss of the firm where they work for and want more money! That's right. They can't manage. We couldn't do that! What do you Mhm. think we are! Yes . They, and and they they've they've on the ba ba had their unions run the blessed country! Well they did. Certainly, they did. I sa And they will again, Stanley! I said If we get the wrong people in. that Jackie will tell you the same, I told her mother anything from thirty to forty years ago I said, that don't matter some toss what political power they get in power you'll find the unions will run the country Yes. the way they're going on! Yes. They demand things! Yes. If, for argument's sake, they want fifty pound, they demand sixty! That's right. That's right. And they know they'll get something. That's right. Well Mhm. all that money that they keep demanding from the er th wa th wa the firms and such like that ought to have been ploughed back into the firm! That's right. That's right Stanley. If they robbed the firm, they're robbing themselves! Yes, and then they are. Anthony said years ago, when the rail ma men went on strike why do it? You'll only bring misery and distress on your own country! Absolutely! And that's as true today! Yes. It is! But they can't see it! All of them around they kill the goose that laid the golden egg. Well that's the trouble, they do! Yes. Yes, but then They do. these firms are gonna pack up! Exactly! Exactly, and then they lose the lot then don't they? there's only one thought for th sa for them and that's for theirse I got erm Patsy coming in for a bite of lunch Oh yes. erm because we didn't see her last week. Yes. Well we And we better get the sweeper sometimes then. Oh you need to Stanley won't you? Because er I can't bear to think of you without this room with that lovely fire in. Well, there you are. There's always some, look at my birds! Oh yes, the birds are there still aren't they? Here's some fat for them. That's your medicine Stanley. Just a minute. Come on sweetheart. Aren't they marvellous! They come straight away don't they? Yeah. They're wonderful! That's your medicine there your eggs there. The instructions on them I suppose? Sorry? The instructions on it are Oh they? Oh, it says, Stanley well you can read it I'm sure. Please repeat the water test when you've finished the tablets. Please what? Repeat the water test Oh yeah. when you've finished the tablets. Repeat? Yes. Ah! That's Yes. the word I wanted. After you've taken those. Righto! I expect they'll tell you how many to take. I sho , I suppose so. Can I just check? I'm sure they will. Yes, you look , you look at them. I'm sure they will Stanley. You look at them. Whoops! Yes, that one's two tablets twice a day and that's for the water test. I see. Alright? So I gotta take them both? What Er are they for? bu , you take that to , er two tablets twice a day that's it. Two tablets twice a day. So that's probably Yes, well what are these? morning and evening. They are perhaps new ones, I don't know. Are they? I dunno, I'll take them but Yes. Two twice a day. Yes. And then this is for your water test. Right. And er, what When those are finished. When those are finished? Yes. That's just to put the water in to put your urine in you see. Let me see it before, ooh I mustn't open it because it'll be ste Oh no! it'll be sterile, you see. It is, it's Ooh he want, he want that for a test? He wants that,yo , he wants you to put some water in that for a test, some of your water in that That's right. Fine. for a test after I've used them? After you've used those. That's alright. And Stanley, we don't open that in the meantime because No, no! it's sterile. Yes. And so it must be for your test, you see? Yes , quite. Okay? So after I've finished those lot twice a day Yes. Well they're the Two twice a day. Two twice a day. Yes. Well that's four a day. It is. Then er, put some urine in there Yes. and let him have it. That's right! That's it. Well I can send it down with anybody. That's right. Oh yes, well er er, yes you can because you need to send it down when it's fresh. Oh yes! Er, so if nobody's going down give me a ring and I'll come and get it. Thank you. Alright? Thank you. So erm Yes. your fat, what I might get the old lady to go down for me. Well er, only if she's going. If she's going. Yes. That's right. If she's going. There's the fat Stanley. How much do you want? It's one twenty nine please. One twenty did you say? Er, one twenty nine Stanley. Please. Twenty If you've got a ten, I've got a one. I got, I've got one . Twenty five Ah. six, seven eight, nine. Good! That's clever. That's right. You almost always have change don't you? Pardon? Almost always have the right change. Yes. Yes. Try to. Yes. Try to. Try to. There. Thank you very much. You're very welcome Stanley. And I'll see you again next week, but if you need anything in the meantime give me a ring will you? I will, thank you very much. Do that dear. Thank you. And, try to keep warm and keep out of this wind. Yes, that's right. Bye bye dear! That's right. And I'll shut the gate. Alright. Okay, so you tha , you don't need to come out at all. There we are. Oh the wind is still cold! It's keen! It's keen, indeed! Yes it is. Yes. Right. Bye bye then Stanley! Bye bye! Bye bye! erm I think it can't be bad for you because you do quite a lot of the same exercise as you'd do in proper aerobics Yes. but you're in the water the whole time. I don't even know what proper aerobics are anyhow. Oh you just keep moving the whole time. Running on the spot and waving your arms about Just seem to keep moving all the time without even running on the spot. Yeah well this is, this is you know it's very difficult to run in the water I know it is. cos it keeps getting round your feet and sort of making you drop over. Yeah. And I suppose developing the muscles that keep you from dropping over it's pro can't be, can't be a bad thing. I suppose it can't, no. I And then you do other exercises like lying on your back, putting your feet your from the knees downwards over the edge of the pool and then trying to do sit ups. Good heavens! I'm too old for any of that. But Noel, isn't exercise against resistance is supposed to have some special benefit isn't it? Well I'm doing that all the time, I'm doing it with you my love. Oh come off it. Erm I don't know, I, I, I, I I just feel that this is that sort of exercise where er Ooh sorry. it only lasts an hour, it's not going to do any harm No I'm sure it isn't. it's erm a good thing to be doing. Because swimming's I think something that does do harm is jogging. Yeah well Well yes that's a beast. I, I did a little jog this morning with the dogs cos it was too cold to walk. Oh Ah yes. And I've got another one this afternoon I think. Have you ever been in the sauna at er Woodbridge? No I haven't. Er er no I haven't either. Er I one, went into one at Iceland that was it was lovely. I've been in a sauna in London I belong to a health club there. Mm. I used to play squash. Mm. That's a violent one isn't it, squash? Yes. I, I can't think that really violent exercise is a good thing generally is it? Something that's more measured Oh I don't think I don't think it hurts when you're young, I think when you're older you should only do it if you've done warming up first. I think so too probably, and you've been used to it. That let's us off, isn't it nice? I think the warming up exercises in themselves are a good thing though Mm. even if you don't do anything after Mm. after warming up. The class I go to on Monday evenings erm we do warming up exercises and I'd be quite happy if they just stayed warming up exercises for the whole hour. Yes. Have you got someone properly qualified taking them? Yes, she's very good. Mm. I went to a sauna in Iceland Mm? and then was able to straight, in, in the hotel it was Yes. straight up in the lift to my bedroom and it was lovely you know, yeah in the hot, in the swimming pa pool Mm. or through the shower then in the swimming pool then back again and when I'd finished with it I went straight upstairs to my room and I went to sleep straight away, it was lovely. I was waiting for him to say he went out and rolled in the snow because that's the proper end isn't it? Mm and you should beat yourself with twigs as well. I'm not I don't know really about that. Oh you should definitely do that, I mean That borders on the nasty I think. They had a there was a sort of electric burner in the place as a whole Mm. where they kept on throwing on Water to water with some erm sort of fir smelling in it. Oh yes, it made steam. Mm. Fine mm. That's it. I should apologize for canned soup, but I spent so long talking to Stanley this morning Mm? you know sometimes you can just tell he wants you to talk to him, and erm so I er couldn't make a proper soup, sorry, but this is I think good actually I think. Yes, which is it? Is it Heinz? Heinz tomato I I made some stock the other day Mhm. and I put some of it in the freezer Yes, ideal. in erm sort of bowls. What did you use for your stock? Some bones. And? Oh some onions and Carrot? carrot, yes. Celery? That gives a lovely flavour. I don't think I had any celery, I had, I had put in whatever I had in the house and sort of various herbs and spices and things. Did you put the bones in the stock before or after the dogs had had them? During? During The dogs went into it instead. Think what a luscious stock the dogs would make. No they wouldn't. Mhm. Erm All that hair. Yuk. erm no what happened was that he gave me some bones that were far too big for the dogs. So I made stock out of those. Where they gorgeous marrow bones? That Yes. Oh yes, they make wonderful stock don't they? Mm. Well normally when he gives marrow bones I ask him to chop them up a bit smaller Mm. but he gave them to me practically Mm. He's an obliging chap isn't he? Mm. I always feel that when he's giving,, because he gives them to one, doesn't charge for any Mm? er anything for the bones, one can hardly say erm give that another whack across the knuckle because He wouldn't the big knuckle has so much locked inside He wouldn't mind. it doesn't it? I do. Do you? Yes. I should really. He wouldn't mind. I ought to have courage. He charges high enough prices for his other things. Yes he, you're right, mhm. Erm when you do your stock do you first of all roast the bone? No but that is erm er a counsel of perfection or something isn't it? It it's a method anyway. Mm. Erm do you? No. Well I didn't because I just couldn't be bothered to put the oven on to get as hot as that for such short period of time. What in fact does it do? Oh I should think it erm melts out the marrow and does all sorts of quite good things for it. It probably gives it a good colour too. It gives it colour erm I'm sure because of the, of the fact that they're roasted. There's one thing that erm I sometimes do to give it colour, is once I've taken off the outside skin of the onion, the very outside Mm? I put the next one in. Mm? Does that, that gives it colour does it? I read that somewhere, mm. Mm. But roasting them, I wouldn't like to get them with any sort of burnt taste. Well I don't think it would give a burnt man may man might be getting maybe about twenty pound in the half a year and the boys maybe only getting twelve or something like that. You How long did it take you to work up to getting a full man's wage? Well it'd be about two pound every half a year. So you had to wait Aye. Mhm mhm. Where did you go after Holland? Well I was er twice in Birsay at 's well after he left Holland. And then I was at Crantit. And then I was back at Holland for another four and a half year. And then I was four and a half year in Sanday. And then I was back here then and I worked er at Antabruk for a year and then I work at Cruisbruk and Sydney was at Antabruk then . What was it like at Holland when you came things changed a lot? Well er it was only I'd been a wee while at er Birsay and a wee while at Crantit till I were back at Holland but it was a different farm I was in then it was a bit different. . I was in er Holland. No no. No no. Same name but no connection but the same name. Originally aye. Mhm. And had changed a lot in that time then? It changed a lot basically the with the food and everything. different? Well the the idea of farming was much the same but he certainly was not very much of a farmer. Mm and was his treatment any different. Slightly but then him and me didn't get on. He never wanted me there in the first place. Oh. Well that's . Aye. Mhm. That must have gone on a lot Oh aye. Aye and then he'd leave. In fact he and then Craigie from Rowsay was in it for a while. And he away to Dale in and then the the s took it on and they've been in it since. And it's changed they out-winter the beasts there now, it used to be that the beasts was in all the time in Winter. when I was a boy of fifteen you were expected to to half acre of neeps in the day. Did what to do expect you to get on with and They expect you to get on They tell you what to do and you had to make the best. It must have been a long day for a boy of that age. It was long day you know. Oh maybe Aye. And what what was school like when you you were going to school ? It wasn't so bad er Greenspot was not very far from the school. . And it wasn't so bad. Firstly we had Robbie for a teacher and he certainly was awkward. Was he ? Aye. Did he . Aye. Who was the first teacher ? When I started it was with Ivy , and she were married in North Ronaldsay with the brother of Sydney, Roy . And she was the first teacher and there was Mi Mr who was the head teacher. And er Ivy got married and she stopped the teaching and died just that same year and then there was the a change for the both teachers. Robbie come as the head teacher and er there was a Miss that was er the pupil teacher. Aye. I never had , he was never my teacher for I was I was with a pupil teacher. Until he died and then I was just . And was it two teachers in the school. Aye, mhm. . There were thirty. so maybe but usually thirty. And what sort of things did you do in the in the . What do you remember. Oh I couldn't tell you very much about it. I can't mind . playing. Mhm. Played and and things of that kind. Tell me what is? Well they were usually a line of kids standing along the wall or something and one set out in the middle of the field and then you had to touch them and then you'd be back to the wall and they had to do it. You changed places one of them catch them . Aye. Mhm. Mhm. Aye and mind the lasses they used to play a lot with instead of marbles they were working with . The boys didn't play with No That's funny isn't it The boys was trying to play football or something of that kind. Or if the ground was kind of wet we used to er make slide then and skate along on it and if the ground got dry we would get a old bucket or something and run round to the tap at the tank at the back of the school and get a a lot of water wet till you could slip on it. And that Tell me about Rob Robbie this this teacher Was it Robbie ? It was Robbie Aye. What sort of teaching did he give then? Well he just well he gave us er algebra and geome geometry and maths and that we were no use. and he certainly had not much patience and we had never seen this afore. If you made mistakes you got the strap you didn't even get the strap just for mischief, you got it for for mistakes and that. Aye. Oh every day nearly. Depending on the mood he was in. Ah he was here for what twenty two from thirty two to thirty nine. Mhm. He'd away just at the start of the war. I was left school afore he left. I was when he left. I to the school after I was fourteen just for a wee while. Aye. And I wouldn't let him give me the strap then. What were you Eh? I wou I wouldn't hold out my hand I was fourteen. Really? Mm. If he gave me a shagging I tried my best to get me heel of my boot down on the stair, something of that kind . When you when you were a young boy I was gonna ask get off the island manage to get I was never away off the island until er I started to work at Holland. The first the first half a year that I was Holland I I don't think I was away for a holiday, but then the the next Summer then I was away . Just for er a few days. For the plane was started here then you see. What did you think to it? It was alright we were got a flip on the when the plane first was just started here, well all the schoolboys and that was er called out on Saturdays to gather the loose stones . Gather them in buckets or baskets and cup then in . And we all got a flip on Ronaldsay for our trouble. Was that Mhm. What was it like? Oh it was fine yeah. What was the plane like? Oh we enjoyed it. Was it were there many seats? Aye just was five or six I think. It was the we used er to go into Kirkwall with mainly. The old repeat planes. Oh but he was alright as a pilot. he did some of the flying himself but he had other pilots. I forget, was one of them and I forget the names now.. And what did you think plane someone who'd never been away from Aye. You weren't frightened? Oh no. No. Well was there mus much going back and fore in the boat . Not really that many there were maybe the the holiday trip to Kirkwall maybe just for the day into Kirkwall. My father was maybe in once or twice when I was a boy and he was maybe buying a horse and that but he was very seldom out of the island that I mind. And I don't think I can't mind my mother away at all. i don't think she was ever away for a holiday. Never away . Well she was in her younger days but after she married Aye after I was born I can't mind her being away. You know. My father was not often, maybe once or twice would for buying a horse or change a horse or something of that kind. He went into Kirkwall. Mhm. Mhm. What happened when you were . Did did you Sometimes aye, some of the drovers come out you see and . Mhm. Aye. Steamers were only used once a fortnight, if there was weather. Sometimes you'd maybe not get a steamer for maybe maybe six weeks if the wind was to the South East. getting er low on sugar and stuff er landed here with a plane.. It must have been a big difference when the plane was . Mhm. Do you remember that as being a Oh aye, aye well you see they had they had the mail service here before the war. To North Ronaldsay. And then er it was stop Well, what worked well? Er, giving people specific jobs, like, combining one . Right, how did you do yours? Your group? Well we decided, decided what we w , what the object was, and then, we got into a position that certain cards so, the cards were split between u , the two of us, so we aimed it in different directions. So you divided into two teams? Yes, and then we decided to pick them up, played back . Right, okay, anybody else can add anything that they felt worked well? We decided to dip into , and pick one each. yes, the same, the same thing there. What went badly? I got one from Mars I think. Then I went back in and did it again. What you made, made a mistake. In er,, you know, we only reversed when we got to the bottom of that last machine, and why had the guy back, erm, went over it, and go through it again, luckily it was only three high. So you had , would anybody of, if they were going to do it again, do it differently? No, oh yes, nick all the cards and played myself on the tune Yes, When we did all work together, all the different pieces worked together, and you could just have a card each and you could have just done it that way. But when you've got forty three , they'll just taking ground anywhere. Could you be fighting basically to see what was what. If you can relate back to branches, everybody was just running around, everybody's had a specific task to do, you were just running round like a , We could have just collected all the cards up, put them in the middle of the car park and all just stood over them . It worked quite well, Speak for yourself, I know I have to look at it, I I noticed, er, I felt three of the groups had somebody centrally who, who was being fed information all the time. I mean, er, in terms of planning what, what did you say at the beginning? What did you, what did your group talk about at the very beginning? Whether all the cards were running off. The changes, we split up so Yes we did, we sort of divided the team up Good idea So what, what did he ? , three cards each, right so we chose three to look at. Yes, so you divided it up like that And what, what was your idea Jane for your team? Because the, there's two different ones to do, so we split it and two did one, and the other two did the other. So you wasn't like four, five year old in a bed, trying to work it out. It just seemed pointless to do, do what all the, the way down the morning and then after do all the way down the other end . Mm, did anybody do one and then do the next one? We did Yes, did you find that hindered you at all? No I can't say we was hindered through the , We came, we came first, excuse me That why our team did the same as you. Ou , Ou, Our system worked okay for us. We were finished about five minutes before We didn't bother about it much, we've had one member as being two or three of the latest. Right. To share our information. So it was kind of energy conservation, yes It's space more than anything. Alright, well thank you very much for doing that. I hope that got us through the little post-lunch siesta period, erm, we're going to do another er, time management game now which will take about half an hour, and I need to split you up once again into groups, erm, okay. Into three groups of six, so if we have, one, two three, one, two, three, one, two three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three. So we're going to do this exercise within this room and we'll need to rearrange the tables, so I suggest that each group as having one table or two tables, put it in a square to work around. So if you could now get together with your people, all the ones together, all the twos together and all the threes together and rearrange the tables in an area of the room where you'd like to work. , Ones? Twos? Twos? Twos? Threes? Any more threes? Threes? What are you? Three. Right, What you're in your group, if within each group you could elect between you one, a manager and two, an observer. Thank you class, have you all decided on your managers and observers. Yes If I could have all the managers and all the observers, please. If you could come out, and out of the room with me. , The erm, shapes, did you ever have to do that with the thingy in the middle? Erm. You've got er, a sh , a T, we knew it was a T, but it could turn to different shapes, No I didn't do that one And then you have to explain it to the person opposite you, or a long distance phone call, and say how you,, and this, because there was a colour done what I've said, he said my colour's completely different, and you've propose all those colour bits, but They're all different. The object of that was don't assume that people have got a sign for , you know. The beauty of having to describe a shape. , And as they're describing it, you had to draw it. So you had to draw it as they describe it. You're not supposed to be reading the news. ,, Do you know if the answers are in there. Did anybody meet that famous , last night about the, how you find out about people ? I think I told Lisa again. It's one of these assertion things Aye, which thing's that? What, what is the name of that? Which one then? It was body language wasn't it? Aye, it wasn't particular clear though. No What's that? , What did Pete say? It's supposed to be a session. So what, what's that supposed to do, if you brush hair it'll indicate to the, the male kind er, that you're interested and that you wouldn't mind getting in touch with them. It's not that you haven't got , or a black skirt or something. , it's a love story , or something. If all he wants is to hitchhikers doesn't he? I know he does. In fact, this Because apparently we've all got to avoid eye contact either that right, or facial expression. I'm going to use it the night before, if you've a minute And all , don't believe it. Yes That's two there isn't it? Yes I've got, they're reading about I. The manager, what's the manager going to do, do you think? Give directions. And the observer's just going to watch the group as a whole because she's not anybody to, to . How much longer do you think? . How about sitting here Deena? Unsure, don't know. Do you think we're going somewhere this week? Nip up then because she probably . Perhaps they're doing pass the parcel like . You know that Piper Alpha thing? No , late at night,, they've got the boat, and the tape, they're both out on tape and video, and basically you have to go back, as soon as the boat comes through docks the next person picks it up and goes, so you've got very little time to pick up information , and all the time you can't go in, and the clock's going , and the clock's going and you switch , and they said it was , next to you, they said it such a Can you buy that then? Yes, it's about twenty pounds but it's X rated. Are we going to prepared to start that then, I'll say we started, I make it, I make it dead on twenty five to now, but if we go by that clock, and if everybody goes by that one it's probably easier, because that's between twenty five to, so if we make it about eighteen minutes past. No but if it's like, not been part of Alright, so do you want to start now. Right as you know I'm the head of a major advertising company. We've been approached by er, the local county who wish to er, make up some radio from the er agency. , surprise, surprise. Okay. What, in order to decide whether they're going to give us the contract what they have asked us to do is prepare a thirty minute radio, sorry thirty second radio presentation and we will re , record for them and they will hear, which we want to emphasise based on how good that was whether they want to take the contract out with us. Okay, is everybody clear on that? Here's the , to go on. It can be anything real or imaginary. The only precondition we've got on that , is that it's got to be thirty seconds long, we can use whatever sound effects we like, we really, to begin with, we have got to have scripts, everybody here takes part in it has got to have a script first, Yes, now what I'm saying is I mean there's going to be, there's four of us, they're five of us here, taking part in the exercise, yes? So if four of us were to work on it as a group , Two of yous do the script together Right so are we, are we going to, do the script, is one person going to read it all out, or are we going to go round and? Let the manager decide. Fair enough, I shall read out the script . Yes, yes, maybe. So if we three start into that . National Children's Homes,, yes, founded in eighteen sixty nine, C H, children's health, and associated with children's charities, we work with, among others children with disabilities, sexually abused children, homeless young people,. Throughout England there are projects nationwide, they need practical support, counselling, and specialist treatment, but above all there are sixteen thousand children a year that hope for a better future. That's a better right, what I would suggest, is somebody take , what I was going to say is if you time me reading this, okay we get an idea of how long exactly we need to make . Founded in eighteen sixty nine, N C H , is Britain's second largest children's charity. We work with among others, children with disabilities, sexually abused children, homeless young people, and . Through our two hundred projects nationwide we give practical support, counselling, and specialist treatment, but above all we give sixteen thousand children a year the hope for a better future. Please support us in our year, N C H, a charity for children . What, what ideas are need getting across, how, what, what the charity does, how the er, how the charity does it, and how we can help. That's three priorities in that order. So I think first of all we need to, need to introduce what the charity is and who, who they're going to be benefitting. I think we'll along with a . Well we don't have an idea on this. No. What does it say in the advert? You said it Who we worked for, so that you introduce the charity, who we work for erm, Right, well what did that, question one what charity d , what the charity does right. Yes, okay, anything like that, caring, caring for children, helping children Not really no,so what we're doing now, we don't want to get too carried away with one, one title, we've got to try and find things to say how we're going to achieve it. We, we've got the how you can help section here, but we've got nothing at all about what the charity does and how it does it, yes we need some appropriate words for getting the idea that they're helping children. yes, then there's the , yes, what that says, at the top, so you can announce what the aim of the campaign is. Can we get help , for the best possible start, we want , something like that, so we're saying, help us to do this, that's how we're getting across the idea they're erm, how they're going about it. Erm, you could say worse, I suppose you could cheat, but erm, Okay I want,, research, help us, erm, help erm, help us give something like that, help us give a best possible start to them, help us give them, to help us, to them, Okay time is up. You can stop now please. Okay then, , , and all the jokes and chuck all your scraps away first. Where's the bin? Are you alright there? Right so what we'll do first of all is get you to your results, and then as each end , we'll get the observers to make their comments. So who wants to go first? I think we'll go first if you like. Yes,, you may as well stay there if you like or you can come down or , Set time. I am I am Julias Denton for homes for the children's charity. Our aim is to build one hundred new homes for our homeless children. Children are all our responsibilities, please support the children's, The kids, , home,. Right, very good, thank you. Phil, you're next. Okay. Go on then. End of Side One. , Shall I bring it down here then, bring it over to there and Yesterday, ten thousand children were killed. Richard Branson saved us over the boredom. Just to survive we need your cash today. Our trip is vital for charity. Please support us on the hot-line , in hope. Mm, thank you, it's very nice. Oh, I'm not too sure, We're the National Children's Home, Action for Children. There is way you can help improve research, we need to give the best possible start to kids. If you care to help rescue children with disabilities and teenagers who suffer abuse we want you to say yes, and to help get eight hundred million pounds Phone now on , with your credit card or visa, or contact your nearest National Westminster Bank. Very good. yes, thank you very much. , They were all very good. Okay then, which observer wants to observe or come out with I don't mind. Okay then, Hannah, what, what happened in your group? Right, do you want me to go through every point? Well erm, Erm, we had a , A couple of tears and so on Yes, go through the first five minutes, there were all different tasks, erm, at first, the girls were making up a basic jingle that would be about thirty seconds, and everyone else was looking through to see what words they should use. And Tracy had already, no, they'd all decided what charity it'd be, Tracy asked what they suggested, so she's democratic. Erm, they all suggested that it should be something like famine. And then they started looking for words that might be relevant so that's quite good. Erm,they put the bit of paper in the middle with the suggestion type of thing that they were , and then they all looked for words, erm,then Ian and Deborah arranged the words on the paper to start ar , rearranging the jingle so that the words that they had, they used their resources like that, and anything else. Tracy was keeping an eye on the time all the time, they didn't rehearse it , none at all. Was that because of lack of time? Yes. At first they were very calm and at the end, at the end there was a big panic that they was, they were all talking over each other, there was no control, you know, it was a bit rushed at the end, but, that wasn't because it was bad planning, it was just they were panicked at the end. It was more difficult than we thought. They should have had more definite targets, because it was a bit, everyone, at one point everyone was doing the same thing,, through the words which Why was that? Pardon? Why was that, was that because it ? Because it, it's terrifying looking at a blank piece of paper when we needed ways to start the comment. yes So we had to get some ways to try and get something down. They all had an input, and Tracy kept them a lot. Erm, as I say, she's like, she's very democratic, and she's always asking them what they felt how, how they felt they should tackle it, I mean They hadn't decided what the message should be Overall, if you had to comment, how do you think it went? It was good, apart from the end. And then there was panic because there was no time in the end. Thank you very much that group. Next group,, okay, Erm, I came down and explained what the nature was, what you wanted to be done, you didn't really explain why and how important that our was, which I felt , that he said what he needing doing, he said what resources he had, and he said that, he didn't really set tasks erm, but he did ask them what they thought they should do you know. Erm, That's good. Sorry? That's what I was going to say. Yes, you set tasks, but by erm, Dave, not by Ian. Erm, at the start it was a bit higgledy-piggly, they didn't really know what they was doing, I felt anyway. And they didn't really decide on what the message was going to be, erm, they just decided to start checking lines, getting words out on what the charity was going to be, they split that up quite well. Erm, I felt that that Tony was getting a bit frustrated It was There was no Yes, I stopped, like. There was no teamwork really to start with. He was getting a bit frustrated, they didn't really know what they were supposed to be doing. Towards the end it got better though, and they got the time right, we timed it towards the end and the wording was right, so it got better towards the end. Okay Erm,yes, and that was it really, at first the , and then it went through, and it was alright at the end. So it was Yes, it was quite bad to start with, quite poor teamwork, and there was no That's what, that's how I felt was happening. We were given tasks, but then the tasks had been given to certain people like yourself, starting to want to do the other things, that other people were doing, and then everybody wanted to do instead of doing the tasks that they were set. Yes, that's what I mean. There was quite a lot pressure and half the team weren't listening to what Ian was saying at that so Alright so, there was a bit of competition between Nobody , at the end When we asked for a script from that side from the beginning, it didn't come. Well no because we hadn't , us, given us any ideas, towards the end it got better, and they were. Towards the end it got better and they worked, it was a bad start, but it got better towards the end. And we actually got all the words out. We got the words up there and timed it right and everything and then a rehearsal was done. Okay, okay, thank you very much. It was very confusing,key words, when we started using key words and when we asked because something wasn't there, and we consulted the script, we were still cutting words out, but, at, the script was definite, but sort of like, two of them well they had doubts, and like we started cutting words out, and then like, the words that were out . Ian started on the script , there were some use of that to begin with, the key words a lot, maybe got stuck on the piece of paper because Maybe not according to, We're all pulling together. What about your team Terry? I think you, you're Er, right, everybody seemed , and getting it follow it by, erm, the first stage of the planning, erm, did the manager clearly understand the nature of the situation? Erm, I feel that she'd read the brief but hadn't studied it, because she, she went back to half way through, and er, looked at the objectives. Erm, she established the objective, not autocratically, but democratically, erm, there were all sorts, the resources available,what we have, yes, that's not a problem, but the, at the same time, the rest of the group went to establishing the objective, and there was a lot of over-talking by people, and I feel that she didn't control it and say, look this is what we're going to do now. Then we didn't achieve, we're didn't produce a work plan or organiser, we went straight in, people were hacking out bits of papers, you know, it ended up as a big pile of words you know. So,, he took on the task of er, writing the script off his own bat, he wasn't appointed to it, er, but he stuck with that throughout, and erm, he stuck to his objective. Erm, he organised the coordinating, after a while she did actually stop them after five minutes and explain the time situation, er, the final objective were the constraints. There was no really interaction on that on anybody's part. Er, nobody looked at the time which, which did cause a problem. yes, we did You were looking at the time, but it didn't come up, I mean. We did yes, we mentioned it, I mentioned. Yes, you mentioned it a couple of times, put there was no-one really keeping a watch on the clock. Not, not that I saw. Can I? , , there's eleven minutes to go, and literally everyone starts panicking. You know everyone's like , , It says it really doesn't it? , Alright then, moving on, moving totally on. Yes, er. Alternate feedback. Yes, but not on an on-going basis. It happened a couple of times,, the exercise. If puzzled. Okay, well I did try to motivate them, motivate them to make the most of each person's individual skills. Er, people chose what they wanted to do. Erm, I cheated. Shit, look Joe, you speak to her, you sit and talking across her,, she's talking to Sharon, you know that, that's all the way through it Come on,, alright, alright. I love you too. Erm, Come on Gary. Erm, good point, she did er, give them letters and she told other people to contribute, she erm, she at one stage ask everybody what they, what the record was. Er, the main problem was the time constraint. There was five minutes to go, Right. And we're still, you know, fighting about changing the script and what have you. But they, they did come up with the work on the results, and then they, they did get time to plan it. Right. And they rehearsed it as well. Er, although Shirley, she took over the ro , erm, she took the role half way through of down on the floor splitting things up things over, er, the rest of them were cutting out words and what have you, and writing out the script the way they wanted it, and she just stuck them on the floor,, and they changed the script, so in that respect she was They changed the script once Yes, no, I mean It depends how you , , ah no, but you, but you weren't aware of that because you were on the floor, as I was saying five minutes ago. , I don't want all that over here. Erm, I mean, all in all they did, they did get the final result, the scene came together right from the last eleven minutes to achieve the result, but it was just there was a lot of confusion at the beginning of the start. Right, okay, well thanks very much, if you'd like to get tables back , Is there a pair of scissors anywhere? A pair of scissors? yes. Well quite an interesting exercise I think? , I hope you're not , well several interesting things have come out of there, it just shows the sort of thing about working under pressure, and the limited amount of time, erm, the limited amount of planning time for the managers certainly. Erm, if the man , who were the managers? Ian, you were one,, and Tracy, if you could just say a few words. What did you find were the difficulties and how did it go really? Erm, I thought mine, when I came back and I briefed everybody so that they all knew what was going on Yes Erm, then I think it probably had us confused for a while, whilst we were just trying to decide who should do writing and who should do what, but then I decided I'd chose two people, and then we started cutting things out so then that, that went okay then. Erm, then we all just worked at getting pieces out on paper, all that was going fine, and then I assigned two more people to stick all the pieces together and trying to create sentences from it, and I think the only time that I, we lost it was like, right at the end we were like looking for a few words to make our sentences make sense. And so we were panicking a bit, because we were just trying to get there, but apart from that, I think it went okay. Like we, we didn't have any arguments amongst the group, I mean I was, everybody was quite willing to do everything, everybody was helpful, came up with suggestions. So it was okay. Okay, what about you Ian? No, no go on. What did you think, we actually got on very well, I mean I thought we worked quite well together as a team. We did, yes. yes We erm, given that you have to do, okay, I didn't brief them as fully as I could of, and half way through I looked at it again just to make sure I hadn't missed the bottom line that said, you know stand on your head instead in the park, so I just had a little read. And we made within two minutes to sort out what we were going to, or we decided what charity first, then we decided two would decide on the script while the others cut out relevant pieces that we thought might be useful words. And then when the sc , we had a look at the script and we changed it a little bit, and then we all went, they were cutting out words, so we were doing, the first few all three ways, and we'd look and say, okay, so it was a scrambled mess as we all looked through for three words and ended up with , and I got down on the floor, so we knew where we were. And then we changed things like the name because we found somebody's name in all these words, somebody , and we just sellotaped it down, and at the end when we were running out of time, and we did about three times have a look at the time, we did change the script slightly to fit the words that we'd found so we had responsibilities instead of, I don't know what it was, but instead of another words, just because we'd found it. And we just changed it again. But once I think we were, we were going in a mad rush er, each saw his responsibilities for that word, and that'll do, and then we'd say yes, and stuck it here. In terms of managing the time, did you feel it worked quite well? yes, I mean we got the end result, Yes Okay we changed a few words just to fit the words we could find, but yes, we, we had about a minute at the end, we read it through, and yes, it was fine. I thought we worked alright together. Okay. Sorry, can I just make one small comment on that? Pardon? Can I just , You, you did actually, again it's the time thing, yes. Originally you weren't really looking at it, five of you all fell into the same trap, you know, they, they get half way through, and they did have something to do and they did sort of start rushing. , Okay then, let's leave that there, and then talked about that at tea, and you can have a talk about it then. Come on Ian. Well I have to admit, with our group, the first ten minutes or was a little bit disorganised because I felt we, I came in, we set down the objects, I felt we did that well, and we were clear of the timescale from the very beginning. We decided quite soon which charity we were going to go for, and we divided up. I mean, I had Tony to go through and find key words that we knew we were going to need, you know, simple words like the, of, with, a, that sort of thing, that we knew that okay, we wouldn't use immediately, but we'd look, ah there that goes there, and use it straight away. Erm, we set tasks that erm, two people were supposed to be working on the script while two people looked through the paper. Now I think what te , what happened there was we er, we drifted away from setting down sc , er, er, scripts to finding good useful key words and phrases out of the paper that we could then fit into the script, and as it had gone that way, I realised it was working, and didn't see any point in trying to get it back to the way it was originally going, because it was going fine. Erm, we had an example advert early on that we actually read through, for the simple reason of finding how long it was going to take, so we had a target as to how long we needed the advert to be very early on and we could work to that. Erm, we carried on, er, it got better as it went on. Tony wasn't impressed a little bit, but a little, a little gee up and we were away again. Erm, I felt that er, we had plenty of time at the end, I mean we, we tried only three times to get it right, and it was okay, and I felt we worked well as a team in that amount of time. Alright well, generally then I think from hearing what you're saying, erm, some good points, some perhaps things that you'd do differently next time, and then what it obviously says about you is that, you're all managers and you all have different styles, and you possibly do things in different ways. And you've been in a scenario where there's one manager and there's a few people who aren't in a managing role, but you are actually managers , maybe they'd like a little reversal, I mean, I think some good things have come out of that, and possibly things that you'd do better next time. We all achieved the target Yes, you all did really well . Yes, thank you Stephen. Yes, perhaps you'd We all achieved the end result. Everyone's just trying the same situation. And they thought Yes, patches of chaos, possibly in the disorganisation, but you got there in the end. Erm, I think what we'll do now is have a quick cup of tea, a nice friendly, smiley , cup of tea, And then I want you to meet, I want you to be back here by quarter to four. It's called time , it gives you a little space at the top so you can fill in what you feel to be your role, and if you can fill below, all the tasks in respective order that you do in a typical day. Right, so a complete brainstorm, and we'll start again, and we'll come back to those in a little while. We're going to spend the rest of the session on time management. We're going to talk about three methods of managing your time. The first of those is delegation, a much talked about subject. Erm, how many of you delegate? Yes Yes, the vast majority? How do you go about that, and what sort of things do you delegate? I look at all the jobs that's got, that have to be done in the day, right, and look at which ones I should do, and then all the other jobs I just share out between the relevant people. Right, is there any kind of pattern to that, or is it on a daily basis that you do that? No, certain things, certain specific jobs are set to certain people. Such as? That are on-going. One of my, my senior section manager does till results, anything to do with till results, my section manager does scheduling. Another section manager does something else, and they do that every week. Okay, does that, and you find that that works well? Mm, very well. Er, what kind of checks to do have, do you have to keep on that? About once every week I'll check that everything's been done. Well, with the scheduling obviously it's checked every day, but erm, things like till results, I check every week to make sure it's been, if she's been, but she's really good so, so I just have to check up. What they did at a branch on our district erm, again it was just like set up, people were given specific tasks, but at the end of the three month cycle, they'd change some people, er, those people's tasks so that they, so they wouldn't get stagnant, and plus, if one person was off, if you happened to be on holiday, you've got somebody else that can do the job at the standard and not let the standard fall. So you're not just reliant on one person, and if that person's away you're stuck. Anybody else delegate? Delegates? I think everybody does throughout the course of the day without even realising anyway, do they? Certainly, the only go , the only way I run a shift , the way she runs checkouts, is erm, by going, you, it's the same thing every day, you've got to run through everything on the same point order, because you know, you've been doing it, it's got to be done at the same time, like bread the last lot's got to be on by four. Erm, so you, it's one of the second, third things to look at when I, I start at three fifteen, it's the third thing I do. The first thing I do is check the stocks, followed by date returns and er, you know, erm, get that done,out of the way, and start looking at the , of the night , and what have you, setting that up, and maybe the late night process, hand over from the branch manager, walk round doing any detail he wants me to do, and hand over from late nights. Department managers, new checkouts, do all the bits and pieces on , and wanted me to do, while I wait for the shift to come in, and they start at seven. Er, keep an eye on them, I'll have a bit of replenishment here and then, erm, so he's, until eight o'clock, and then you get everything pulled out. Erm, replenishment until ten o'clock, er, get the warehouse , get the clear-out underway. So where do you actually delegate within that? To the er, because there's no other management in the place, you just delegate to another member of staff. And is that er, do you have one person that you allocate specific tasks or do you go on a daily basis. Er, it's like, it's like the foreman on the shopfloor for some reason, there's a er, in the systems or whatever, er, the warehouseman er, the night porter er, when he takes over, he knows what he's doing, he knows what I want, because I've spoken to him about it, erm, he knows what items I want to leave for stock people, erm, and Sue, the checkout manager, she'll know if I want extra people on the shopfloor because we're quiet, or I expect it to be quiet, erm, she knows where they've got to be, and I'll come back and review it with her. Okay, anybody else delegate? Yes, well how do you do it Teddy? Well it's, you go in in the morning, and it's the same jobs every day really basically. Erm, the , I first tell people what to do because they all know their roles, and when you go in in the morning, and you're just basically going round checking that they've already done it all. Okay Erm, if there's something needs doing extra you just ask the person who's best for the job to sort it out and to do it for you. So your role is more a checking and writing one, similar to what Helen. Yes, well with the staff I've got, yes, they're all there. At night-times I've got my jobs to get stuck into on the shopfloor as well, just hope that everybody works as a strong team basically. Yes, does anybody here not delegate? I did delegate, but I won't do it now, I do literally Say that again, I missed that. Er, I sorry,, just clearing my throat, er, I did, I did delegate if somebody put it on the end of somebody's assignment, then I to it, but I tend to find I underestimate what people can do for me all the time, and don't identify just how much those people can give me back, and I did, or I do have a tendency at times to give people like before, to hold on too much, try and do too much myself, and er, you can't do it that way in case. But once you've, you've got to know your people better, develop your people better. Right. It's something I've got to work on. To decide for yourself what they're capable of. Why, does anybody else find difficulty with delegating. No, I was just going to say that if, if you try it once, you know, you know if they can do it, they'll be . Oh, yes. I was going to say, I like to set somebody task as they're down for, and I look for it, and nine times out of ten you'll find out if they can achieve that very shortly, very fast. And if they cannae cope with it, they'll come to, or the majority will come and say look I cannae do it. If it's something silly, that they haven't been trained for, but most jobs you can delegate and they'll do it just as well as you. It's just a matter of having confidence in them to do that. Since, since Norwich, you just can't delegate like erm, you just ha , you don't have any other management there, only section managers, and you delegate that job to er, supervisors, erm, it's a very on-hands management situation. You can delegate to anybody can't you. You can delegate your staff as well. Yes, yes, fair enough, but erm, Depending on the task, it depends what the job is. Yes, I mean, like I mean making late payments, I'm delegating people to fill up those late payment. Okay, it's delegation, but it's not erm, the sort of like, a responsible job if you see what I mean, it's a job that they're employed to do anyway, but it's not a separate sort of task. Yes, okay. What's the difference between delegating and abdicating? Delegate erm, you can delegate the job, but you can't delegate the responsibility. Right, so when you delegate, what are you delegating? Specific tasks, the physical But when you delegate that task is there anything that you retain? The responsibility that it's being done right. Right, and who is ultimately accountable? Yourself. Yes, right, okay. When we're talking about delegating tasks, I think tasks can be almost categorised into two clear sections. Has anybody heard about how tasks can be categoried? I think they mentioned it on the video. Urgent and important. Right, then there's that which we're going to come onto in a minute It's active, isn't it, instead of reactive Reactive, yes. Can you erm, explain what a reactive task is, Tracy? It's something you haven't got planned into your day, isn't it, it's something that comes up, and you, you have to respond to it, so you have to have time between the day, to be able to do those things. Okay, can you give an example? Erm, it's like to keep my day planned out but, like the district manager might walk in or people might go off sick, and then you have to fill somebody in to that position. Things that you just don't think are going to happen So you act Especially management goes down ill or something. Okay, so they're unexpected can you thing of any, er, another kind of way of erm, other tasks that possibly could be described as reactive tasks? I've got customer experience. Pardon? Customer experience. So you've got customer query, or something like that. yes The bakery , and you're expecting a delivery, especially like on produce, and then you have to go off , or something like that, get people stacking right up. Okay, what about erm, if the opposite, I mean if we've got reactive tasks, what's the opposite of that? Proactive Proactive, or possibly just active. And how would you describe an active task? Something you do every day anyway. Right so they're regular, Regular, yes. What do they do for your department? I mean that, can you think of examples of active tasks? cleaning, checks Till checks, right, interesting that you should say that. Erm, just filling up shelves. yes, interesting you should say that, because the definition I had was something quite the reverse. Many of these are planned for, isn't it, you might do it every day, but you've planned for it, Right, So you, you'll be able to do it every Monday, but you've planned for it on Monday, you know who's going to do it, and they, you know, it's set up. Okay, so it's something right. The way I would possibly define active and reactive, I would see active as things that actually take your department forward a step. They are things that you do which actually improve your department both in the short and in the long-term. The long-term specifically. Things like okay, ordering possibly could be reactive and active, because yes, it's something that has to be done every day, but if your order in spot on, that is an active task, it would improve and benefit to your, you would say that that,. Whereas reactive, I think one typical task that's a reactive task which is yes, it's unexpected or whatever, is cardboard collecting, because it's the type of thing that happens regularly, but it doesn't actually get your department, it doesn't It doesn't achieve anything. No, in a day you do now, then later you've got to do it again. It's one of those mundane tasks. yes I mean, can you think of any, I mean, putting that kind of interpretation on it, can you think of anything else other than cardboard collecting. Tidying the cabinets, dressing them down . solids. Do you often find yourself doing these tasks? All day long. All day long, right. And most of the night. One, I think one of the tasks that you find branch managers doing on a fairly regular basis is collecting cardboard. What? Some of them do. My branch manager does it all the time. Yes, my branch manager does it all the time, yes, it's his regular way out. It's escapism. Escapism, exactly, you've hit the nail on the head there Dee, escapism. It's a comfort blanket, that's what it is, when you see your branch manager collecting cardboard, it's usually because he's feeling a bit stressed out. No, it's just because he's lazy. It could be just because he's lazy. Alright, what about, when you mentioned as well, we've got reactive and we've got active tasks. What about, you said something about, somebody mentioned important and urgent tasks? Who said that? I did. Yes, what do you see as those being? Well urgent tasks would be tasks that are done at that time, to complete them. So urgent equals time Equals time limit. limit and I mean, urgent is now isn't it, Yes It's to be done A S A P. What about important? Important, it has to be done, but it's not as, it's not as important as the urgent. Is that, is that right, what do the rest of think? No, it needs to be done but it's something that It needs to be done but do you know what I mean, if you don't your important things on time they become urgent yes, yes. No, because things come up unexpectedly, so things will become urgent that maybe you didn't think were important, but have just suddenly emerged. Do you know what I mean? Unexpected things that emerging you have to do there and then, like The whole day's important isn't it? The whole day's important. Yes, everything, a lot of things are important, and what you're saying is true Alex, that if you do the important things when you should do them, they won't become urgent, but equally what Tracy says is that, is true is that you will get unexpected things cropping up where you have to drop everything. I tell what is urgent is a message coming down to you, you've had a delivery team, they're going to destroy cases of whatever, so that's urgent, that has to be done there and then because it's a danger to the public or whatever. So that's important. And then you've got emergencies. How long, I mean, how, in terms of, in terms of time that you spend on urgent or important tasks, how long do you think an urgent task may take? Not long, not very long. So it's relatively short? And what about important? You might take your time on that, more time. So it could be something that's rather time consuming? Can things be both urgent and important. What can you think of that possibly is? Well your could be important first thing in the morning today, as you're sidetracked into doing other things, then it becomes urgent doesn't it, if you've had to reposition your , and whatever. Right. What I'd like you to do, is to have a look at your time , one, and first of all see notes down on it, make a note beside each task that you've got on there, whether it's active or reactive. Bearing in mind that active are things that take your time forward, in the long-term, reactive are things like scale checks, you know you're daily, fairly monotonous tasks like that. Aren't some, some of them both? Sorry? Aren't some of them both? Er, that's a possibility yes? You know you could say these scale checks, they're , but they're still urgent to be done. The, they're still, they're, they're not active in that they don't actually progress your department do they? If your scales are wrong you're not progressing are you? No, but we're not, we're not arguing that they're not working. Just classify them as being reactive and active, by them. Totally monotonous It tends to be the case that when a task is identified as being reactive you can usually delegate it down, because it's very, it's a monotonous, everyday task, it doesn't actually move the department forward. It's not strictly a managerial task. Has anybody got any reactive tasks on their lists? Yes Yes Well shout out a few. Not, not as many as active though, because you could say that stock checks and checks are reactive because you're doing it every day but, stock checks move the department forward on your stock reports. Right. But you could delegate it down couldn't you. I mean, I would say the overseeing of that, and trying to improve your stock results erm, as a key result area, is the active part of it, but the actual everyday doing those checks, you can delegate that down. So reactive, you delegate down I would have said in the, in the large part. Why have you got any down there? Butchering's a tasty part of , if I wanted to do anything I'd take a leaf out of, I would say is that, but I delegate down through the butchers. Cutting meat? Do you like it? Yes. Would you say that cutting meat and getting it on the shelf every day, takes your department forward? Yes, yes. It's just an everyday task. I would agree with you yes, An everyday task is something that you have to do every day, so No, no I'd agree with you, because to me pricing is, is active or whatever it is You couldn't wait, That's priority, that's got to be. No it isn't because it's a day to day activity. Yes but it's all based down on cutting more. What you've done is there, you've, you've, you've done your cutting programme, and then you delegate, yes, but the actual cutting, give that to the butchers. Yes. So the programme's the bit that you do, and then to them basically well, we need a carrier bag. Ooh I like them jumpers dad. I like that. Yeah,that is. That's really nice that is! I'm not sure about the white one though. Let's go and watch that. And, I like that you know. That's nice innit? Yeah.

Bumbling John Major dropped one clanger after another yesterday as Britain's economy took yet another hammering and last night he was reeling as two new opinion polls showed Labour verging ahead to a five point lead, enough to put them into Westminster with an overall majority . Oh! Everybody's saying now, that it looks as if the Labour are now good, but what can they do to us Ded? It doesn't matter who gets in power dad! We , we're gonna be just as bad off I think! You see the thing is that we want the economy to pick up. Yeah. We want our houses to go up in in value and this sort of is not important to us! We want things moving! That's it, yeah. Nothing's happening at the moment! No,i ,i , the country has laid dormant, hasn't it, for the last Yeah, yeah. three four years, it's gone down?

We don't want you on tape. So the thing, the thing to do is to sort of dot around in the conversation things like pre antidisestablishmentarianism. And hopefully This will get modern usage of words. Of, one of the words that she was talking about, people have started using wicked for a normal phrase. I mean, it doesn't mean what it says in the dictionary any more. That's a really wicked thing to say, he went, no it's not it's bad, it's not wicked. He thinks of wicked as being good, he doesn't, cause Mandy says wicked. Yeah. Well that's the idea anyway. He goes round saying wicked, it's his favourite word. Are you going to go to sleep, eh? Please That doesn't mean much, does it? She's just looking over there to see which one she wants to throw up on. Who do you want to go and gurgle at? Eh? Oh not Uncle Brian, no no no. No? Have you had enough grub for a little while?

Don't know what she was looking at. What were you looking at? Well she definitely looks at her mobile. Yeah?

Well, yes. Well I mean that's what's nice for them, isn't it? Yeah. You see they've got a short concentration. Do you think music in the background sort of, do all the lyrics as well .

So she said, mm. So I said, you can go in there when we are, when we done the shopping. So I said, if you are a good girl you can choose a cake. So went to Tesco, and we walk around, the cake, erm, cake thing Aisle? and er, I said Oh Charlotte, don't talk with your mouth full. We went to Tesco to buy some milk. To buy some milk? Because Sainsbury didn't have any yesterday. Did they have any today? I don't know, I didn't go today . What did I do today? I made beans, when I'd finished sorting out this one I .

Keep your mouth closed when you've got something in it or we'll take something away. It's not, it's not very nice darling, to do that. It's not good manners. We want to bring up a nice girl, not a little pig. Alright? pig. No, nice girl, not a little pig. pig. Yes, nice girl. Are you a nice girl? What? Not the way you stuff your cake in your mouth like that. Dear oh dear. I wouldn't bounce at the same time Don't bounce when you're eating please. And shut your mouth. Good girl. trampoline now. You're going on the trampoline. Well finish your mouthful first, please. Or Ah that wasn't her fault. Have you finished? Have you finished eating? No. No? No calls for you. Swansea. Right hand side. Oh right. I couldn't work out what you were talking about. It only takes one at a time. No it's not now. It's bath time really. Be bath time in about fifteen minutes. I thought you'd finished your cake, haven't you finished? Catch it, one two three catch it, one two three. I said catch it, you didn't catch it,. What? It's Top Of The Pops. Top Of The Pops, oh I haven't watched Top of the Pops. will sit there cringing, said I can't believe they put this rubbish on terrible. Who was on it? Don't know who was on it actually. Well she doesn't like M C Hammer, he was on, and then there was one week with Germans on it and it was, erm, it's a German group that used to be popular and haven't done a song for ages. It wasn't the Robots was it? Yeah, the Robots. I mean, it was just the words they were using, I mean oh It makes you cringe, oh and then that er girl oh she's done quite a few things recently. She sings much better than she talks. back to my diet today. Thank you very much, yes I will actually. No, it's not my day to diet, been, been naughty today. Oh dear. Pop him on the shoulder. . So did you enjoy Paul Simon? Yeah. She was about to but she found a sticker on book She comes out well on tape doesn't she? Who Charlotte? Mm. I didn't realise how clear her speech was until I heard it on the tape. It's really quite good actually. Not bad. Oh we'll do this one again. drop off Cos it's lights and things isn't it? She was looking at er lights in Sainsbury's the other day. It looked like that, didn't it? Carol was swaying at her. You missed that. I just swayed at her, and she It's Conway Twitty isn't it? Is it? Oh no. How far back does this go, I suppose early fifties? Er nineteen fifty six. I remember Conway Twitty. Oh yes. You were in your cradle. Elvis, didn't he? I don't think he ever recorded it, I think he just used to sing it at his, er sort of cabaret. Well so many of these songs have been done by so many people that you would be forgiven for thinking that, that. Because there's one there, one on one of these that er either Paul Simon or Art Garfunkel or someone, can't remember which one, probably Art Garfunkel as Paul Simon does all his own doesn't he? Well he has done other people's. Well there's one on there, I can't remember Like for instance the, er, what do they call those two? Oh the two brothers. In the Everley Brothers? The Everley Brothers, that's it. You know, Wake up Little Suzie? Oh yeah. Well Simon and Garfunkel did that Wicked far out. it's a groovy record this. Shut up. Can't remember which one it is but I'll recognise it when I hear it. He's doing very well, isn't he. He is. Have to employ him full time. He's always quite good. I just can't believe how daft he is. I suppose you like that film. Yes. Forget it. You're not having cake. Does she like cake? Well she's looking at it. So how's things down at the ? Not too bad. Quite good actually. Yeah? Keeping him busy out on estimates and Yeah he's out all this week. Well, my dad won't pass them on to Terry. Me dad said he's had enough Well, we were debating whether to give it to you or not. But I thought, well if Terry notices he might . Well in fact two really big estimates Who, Terry? Yeah. And one wanted re-estimating, the other one wanted a few more prices cos everything like marble tops which are going to cost a fortune to get done. We give them a provisional kind of price and not really gone into it in detail. So she had a list of about five things she wanted sorted out and she said so far we were the cheapest. But she's got about six different firms on the computer and was comparing notes. So I worked out and the other two were really fitting and electrics and it was all down to Terry to sort those out. And they're both, about two to three thousand pounds worth of sanitary ware or more but two to three thousand pounds worth of work. Well you can't afford to lose them, can you? No. So what's going to happen then? God knows. He said, I asked, asked, well I left a message on Saturday for him to sort them out didn't I? He already knew about that. And then I asked my father on Tuesday to remind him and he said, he'd already said he'd fetch them in on Tuesday. And he, my father reminded him last night and he said yeah he would have them by tomorrow morning. But he's , he just really has to get in touch with one of them and tell them the prices. So I don't know. Well, I mean he'd done, he's done this first estimate, these are all just polishing touches cos people are obviously interested in, you know they're well keen on our prices. they can't pursue it till we come back to them. They're not pursuing it until we put these things out. My father just turned round I've had enough of it if Terry's not going to do the estimate he passes them on to Brian. I said yeah then I get into trouble with them for not passing estimates to Terry and then there's an argument. If he, if he says anything to me I'll just have to tell him. But he's not doing the estimates he's been given and he can't afford to throw money away. It's cos he's working for him at the moment money. He always gets like that and then he forgets after like a month or two when he hasn't worked for him. He forgets how annoying he can be and you know he swings the other way. I mean Brian's pulled in a lot of work. lot of people kind of saying come back again on Thursday So he's, he's . If we got Terry to do that we'd be well away. They, they would love him I mean one of them it was annoying really cos Terry's just not pulling his weight. I don't understand it, if I live to be a hundred I won't understand it. And also, it's cos that, you know after we had that row about Terry, after Bank Holiday expecting not to have to do a day in the shop, and er he's already owing Brian a day? Guess who's doing the extra day?got my dad to cover a day. And then he takes a day off Bank Holidays. and he can't do it because my dad . But then tomorrow he's actually doing his own work. So he could easily have . And on Monday So who's covering tomorrow? Well my brother's covered practically all week and Brian's doing tomorrow. Terry phoned up asking what, Tuesday morning about quarter past eight said who was covering. And he said well my father is doing today I can't do today I'll do it Friday and I shouted down the stairs but he owes you a day you shouldn't be going in. I mean he hasn't been in the shop once this week. Somebody's got to tell him to So do Dave and Terry in the shop . They have the records. And it hasn't been sorted yet? Oh no. He's got the gall to phone up on Tuesday and say Eileen can't do a day, we're going to be short of Eileen. So the answer is to just phone them. I can't do it. I'm not doing it. What's the point of carrying on like that? Well he's going to carry on like that isn't he? Not unless someone puts their foot down. And if your father is currently taking your side of things worth sounding him out as to how far he'll take Ah whilst he's in the mood? Yeah. He's not being that much You sure? Mmm. He's probably only in the mood cos he's probably upsetting them on his night out cos they go out in the evenings. On a Wednesday evening, don't they. Cos Terry I mean , wouldn't he rather have Terry as a sort of permanent worker anyway? It's not being fair do any work. Oh what, your dad? Pauline's dad er too expensive I think. Terry uses the shop to get extra money every so often, uses my dad ticking over running when he Why . He does get the offer, I mean two months and she phoned up and I kind of made out it got lost in the post. I erm got, check you've got two days, you've got give me the estimate, it's got to be on because she's expecting it to be done straight away on the computer and sent. And he actually got that one done. Do you know it was only five lines. I mean I could have made it up it was that easy. So I sent that off. She was in first thing, I mean I sent it off that evening she was in first thing the next morning yes that's fine . So he's got that job and another one . She's trying isn't she? I don't understand why it surprises you, that's what gets me. I mean It's normal behaviour . Charlotte's done it too. Can you pass me that er, sheet? This? Is that your reading? That's not your regulations you have to read is it? Oh no, that's a I was going to say that doesn't seem very thick No, that's to do with this tape. Oh I tell you what is quite funny these, the act. Mmm. Oh. hereby enacted her gracious majesty, you know, etcetera etcetera. What was it, the Lords temporal and spiritual, that's what they call themselves. Now that is, that's Yes. Yeah I realise and I hope I don't come into contact with too many acts of parliament. Oh, we had someone round to see the house yesterday. Oh yeah? They came twenty minutes early, there's Brian up in the shower, there's me stuffing things in the cupboard under the stairs. That's an old trick. I said to Danny, don't open the door. Don't open the door! So as I'm still trying to stuff things away, she opened the door and everything fell out. look round the front room, then they looked round the, the garden. While they were looking round the garden I you've got to get out the shower quick. I don't know. They'd come down from, they'd come down from,erm, somewhere or other. They're just doing a kind of tour of loads and loads of houses cos they keep moving with his job. Oh, right. She quite, I think she liked the area, she was saying about the schools and that. Mind you, she likes erm and they're all separate, all the best ones round here are . She said don't they have any details? So I said well, no it's not now is it, it's erm, oh it's that school that the . Something and School of Arts now it's called well technical School of Arts round here? No it's another, well technical, performing arts here. performing arts and that's the technical It's a monstrosity. Oh you rotten old pig, you've been sick. Oh she hasn't? Oh. Yeah, it's alright. is it washable? Yeah, I think so. You'll soon find out. Yes. Do you feel better now? Obviously. I think she thinks she's got some milk now. I thought you said, one, you had to have somebody involved who is?. No no no one person that's not right. Oh, right . There is no, statutory obligation for the person organizing it Oh, I know. Well not the organizer surely oh I know I would have thought you'd have to,shoot it I'm sure that the social services require psychiatric or Mm, I would of thought so obviously medical what you're doing. Mhm but they're to be qualified people involved. But I would have expected that the whole thing would have to be operated by, somebody who was qualified. I don't know, because like, you know like the doctors I think it sort of depends how big that you want to get involved in. If you're just somebody who's on the outside providing services, to keep the smooth running of it then you don't really have to know anything about it. Mm. But if you're actually involved in it, and you want to be involved in the people, then I think you have to know something about it. Well the other evening they were showing something on T V, one of these doctors', doctors' practices that are opting out or whatever. And they got a stockbroker, someone who used to be a stockbroker, actually managing the whole practice. Yeah. I mean he's obviously not qualified as a doctor. Mhm. So I mean I suppose they'll look at it in the same kind of way, somebody who's got managerial, management qualities rather than I suppose people who are interested in the other side of it, the medical side of it, probably, really be geared up to organizing the money side of it wouldn't they, usually one or the other. So have you done any more calculations on it? There's nothing really more I mean the whole thing is a budget guesstimate. I've no idea yet, really what, I mean, you know, for instance I don't know how much ratio staff to patients they need, therefore you can't really, you know, follow that up because you've no idea what the costs themselves could be. Well you don't know, have you, have you found the statutory requirement for space yet? Per person. I think the thing is going to come unstuck in the, I think the biggest thing is, I was thinking, is the fact that you've got to get I wouldn't get a commitment from Social Services until they see a property actually ready for occupation. Now I'm not gonna be prepared to go through the whole business and then find them say oh sorry you're wrong. Property is the biggest bugbear. Yeah. Because I don't think If you're actually sitting on I don't think the banks are gonna want to invest. To be perfectly frank. You see the only way we can get equity out and put money in ourselves is by selling this place. Yes. Therefore if we don't actually want to live in the same place as the residents, which I certainly wouldn't want to do, right. We'd have to buy two adjoining. Yeah. So that either means providing it, or something further down the scale . I mean that's, huge. That to be honest is, is somebody who's like, been doing this for ten years and has already got themselves like half a million pounds of worth of equity. You know it's a huge property. But you would need a large property to do what you want? I don't think so. It would be eleven bedrooms and five receptions . The point is, that you've got to count, if , you've got to count one bedroom Yes, I've got you count one bedroom for all the . You may even have to count two. You certainly got to count one. So two bedrooms out of twelve are no longer available. Sorry? Say that again in English. They're coming to collect the stuff next Thursday. But I don't have to do it every day all day. It's twenty tapes. So that's twenty times ninety minutes. talking about his estimates. Very exciting stuff and I've been telling her not to speak so loudly. Have you had enough now? and then I'm talking about right? It's gonna cost five and a half thousand mortgage. At this point would cost about just, just about half. Six bedrooms would pro , six bedrooms would probably cost you two to buy. five and six bedroom houses and you won't get anything under two hundred thousand pounds. How much do you wanna to bet on that? Mm? Where? I've been waiting for on one. Where? You've got to spend as much or twice as much there as you would there as you would anywhere else. Those other properties, there isn't half the amount of work need doing there as . needs a lot of work. If we moved in then we'd have to spend fifty thousand pound to get it up to scratch. That's just to live in. Alright, O K, let's say two hundred grand, O K? It's still fifty per cent less than one of those properties at Harrow Road, right? Fifty per cent less on the mortgage means erm about three and a half thousand . It's effectively eighteen thousand per annum saved, right? The cost of and gain four bedrooms the cheaper it should become. Oh yes it is, I don't doubt it but the problem is right? And you've got to be realistic. Because no bank is going to give you the money against the costs of the value of the property right? They're gonna give you the against equity equity of some sort. But the only way you can get the equity, right? The only way we could get the equity. We could do it. The only thing I could do I mean at the same time I'm saying O K I'll go in to do it this way, would be to actually say, sod this for a lark, instead of doing erm totally private thing, gonna set up a private limited company to issue cheques. I really couldn't I would never get the price I'd want for the alphabet. Shall we go for a stroll? No . Fetch the No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean, no? You've got to take the with you. Why? Why are you . Why are you going for a walk? To go and see What have you bought? Oh you're not starting again, are you? Yeah, you're not to smoke any more. I haven't got any. You are not to smoke You're looking so guilty. The pair of them. Really. Excuse me, excuse me ladies. Since when do you ask Brian if he wants to go for a walk? This is nothing to do Empty your pockets. Come on. This is going down on the table. Come on, you're not going to have them in there, are you? I'm not daft. Alright? I wasn't born yesterday. You might forget them one day and they'll get washed. That is not for me to contribute to. I haven't said anything about it. Amy . Let go of my neck. She's a major contributor to these tapes, aren't you? Shall we take her for a walk? You really must think we're daft. He's sleeping down here tonight. It's bad enough being woken up by the baby without going back to bed and then being woken up by . I've been going to bed at half past one and I was doing the T M A for two nights, then I've been doing his V A T for two nights so I've got to bed really really late and I just and, the thing is, the T M A were all on about my then I just start to relax I had to resort to herbal knockout drops. Oh that's very naughty. Right. Definitely smoking . Well, we were sitting there doing the V A T and I thought, I don't know that's just not but How much is it when you want to go cinema? Oh,about two seventy five I think but I'm not sure Is it as little as that? it might be more but . Well I'd either do it that way or pay, erm, credit cards. I don't really take any notice. Terrible Naughty, isn't it? I don't think it's terrible White Fang. Oh what on earth's that? It's the latest Disney extravaganza, and a wolf cub in it, oh Kirsty loves . Oh isn't it? No, it says here, the story of a young wolf. Oh, she'll probably like that tomorrow we'll go somewhere and spend my money. Yes I suppose by the time she's here look different. Gonna have your hair done?a perm. She hasn't got enough to have a perm, has she now? I think she's gonna grow it out. She's gonna, perm the top so she can grow it out. I told you, didn't I say, as soon as she gets it cut she'll be growing it out. Where are you going to get it done? Er in they normally cut it well. Bit expensive though. Twenty one pounds forty five. Just to have it cut and blow dried? Regardless of whether it's a restyle or trim. Bit expensive. That is. Mind you, my hair was a lot better when I was having it done . I must admit though it looked lovely, I'll say that. I only had a trim, but the blow dry made it sort of Do you remember when I got that, my hair cut really short? They did that, and that was, that was really nice. When I look back at the photographs I think And even when it was long I had, there was one hairdresser there called Paul, whom I'd go and see regularly . I'd go and see him regularly because he did it really well, once he left Well I had one like that, you know when we used to go to that gym up in Chelsea? Mind you my regular's back and she charges three pounds. six weeks. I haven't been since, what isn't it? Trouble is now, cos I know a hairdresser the shop, if I go somewhere else, it looks a bit you know and yet I'm not very satisfied with the way he cuts it, he's done it cheap. Mind you, he did Mandy's at Mandy's, I thought that was quite nice. Have you got a hiccup? Caught it off Amy. She's gone to sleep now? They are aren't they? But he phoned up to order it and said oh my wife likes these soppy things, he bought it, I didn't. It had nothing to do with me. Then he wants me to tape it so he can have it in the car cos it's on C D. Hold your breath. drink some water, concentrate Well, if you want to get rid of hiccups, drink Hold your breath and push seems to work on me. stand on your head. Run round the block or something. Why can I, er I can't have hiccup? Because you don't like them. You keep complaining every time you get hiccups, you say oh I don't like them. I'm trying to help get rid of them, sorry. Supposed to work isn't it? Once she's gone, once she's gone she's gone. Oh dear, oh we've come to the end. Oy, psst, you are a little fidget. Where is Adam and Brian? Mm? Where is Adam and Brian? They're not having a cigar, they're walking round the block. They're not having a cigar. So they keep telling me. They've gone out for a walk to have a cigar but as far we're concerned they're not having a cigar. They think we're stupid and we don't realize Well, I'm not supposed to tell you but he was smoking on the station when we just caught sight of him. Well I'm sure he was. I said how am I not supposed to say anything, I said I don't approve why should I keep this quiet? Cos it's not good for you. It's not on. Brian is, because we've been out a couple of times and he does, I mean if we go out he'll smoke then and then he just normally stops. Yes, he had one to celebrate, but he didn't just buy one he bought a box. So of course he had to keep smoking them until he'd finished Until they'd gone, yes. And he told me, well quite soon quite soon after she came along. I think he actually went for a walk with Brian. Oh, I assume he brought No, no, this was the last one. I said, you had the last one two days ago. So the last one of packet number I don't know what. Well Brian can stop terrible now, he's really snoring, god . I've got to the point now, I kick him and tell him to turn over, he turns it over and it's just as bad as before. Yeah, yeah. I don't want to be married. No, don't bother Well at least have separate rooms. I wouldn't mind, but it's normally me that goes and sleeps on the settee and I don't see why I should. Well, no the other day he said if I'm really that bad you just tell me and I'll go down and sleep on the sofa. And I went berserk about two nights later and said for god's sake you're driving me bonkers, go away and sleep on the sofa. He's turned over and started snoring. Well he can be lying there sometimes and I'll say, will you roll over please. Mm. Go on then. Mm. Will you please roll over! Or some of the time I've been sitting there in the bed feeding the baby, you know Mm. and go shut up! Shut up! It's awful. Well, I've found now I do a combination of what's that stuff, erm,orbathol that seems to help a bit. I don't think it helps him, it helps me calm down and go to sleep. Knock out drops. put that all over, I keep forgetting to take those herbal tablets, they seem to help with colds or whatever but I haven't got those upstairs at the moment which doesn't help. And then last night I just took my stuff and knocked myself out instead. I don't see why I should have to knock myself out have to be a man unfortunately. Trouble is I go into such a deep sleep I can't wake up in the morning if I do, you know, take the herbal stuff, I , I'm flat out in the morning, can't wake up. I think I got up about half past eight this morning. Goodness me. I had to go to work about nine. Oh what are you doing? Oh shut up. Go away. And he gets hiccups. He eats too much too quickly. He gets really violent hiccups though, you know, really th , they sound very, very painful. My baby's ones do. Mm. You know when it, you can just hear everything going ckkk ooh. Is she awake? No. I'll have to put you down some time. I felt so sorry for Christine. Do you know she's now, she was quite cuddly, she was fat in the pregnancy when I saw her last time. And in the space of three weeks I think the baby's used up all her fat because she's now just really, really pregnant. But, not so much her face, but all the top part of her looks slim, almost, you know I mean, she's got no fat left there, on her arms it's all gone. Just a bit left on her legs so the baby must have used up all if the baby carries on like this she'll be anaemic I think. When's she due? Did you say? Eleventh, so she's got another, almost two, well two weeks, ten days. Mm. She said she can't sit down, can't stand up. I was just sitting there for about five minutes then she got up, then she, ooh, sat down, then she got up. I don't think it can be too long. Now what about that then? I can't believe how quickly the time's gone. Mm. Do you want to sit down ? broke today. Ooh broke? I mean I was, one minute I was walking round, I hadn't touched anything another minute it was catching my finger. I looked down to see what was kind of stinging my finger and the ring had snapped and was pinching where it caught my finger. I can't get mine off. Well I can't wear a wedding ring now, it, just cos it's so wide, it's a really wide one. And if I wear where I had the eternity ring on and the engagement ring and the wedding ring it just felt like arthritis, it used to get really painful. So I said oh blow this that's coming off. I suppose I'll have to get another wedding ring. It's fashionable to have a kind of reason I don't think so. So I'm feeling less and less married the more rings I keep breaking. I can't get my wedding ring off. No. Well, my fingers get swelling as well, so I thought it wouldn't do any harm. Well I have finished Well they're all up there. O K. Well I could not ask you before. Well, yeah, if you look, ooh, I can't think where. I think there's a book-rack up there and I think some of them, the patterns are out of the magazine and they're just, in a rack, I think. If you go up there just leave them as they are don't leave them all over the place. put them back. Are you making something? Depends how much time I've got. Yeah. What are you going to make? Some Yeah? What the ski , lycra type one? Little? Lycra. Oh that one, no. fabric . Do you want the fitted or loose? You want like, like that, floaty? Like, like these, or, more like jogging pants? No, like these. Well if you want them to stay pretty as opposed to going baggy then you'll need to have a bit of lycra in the fabric. Keeps the shape better. Mandy loves her top. Oh, the body? The body? Yeah, she was wearing it flat out when she was So you didn't get a look in then? Oh no, I was wrestling it off to wash it in the end. She kind of wore it with everything she could think of I think that would go. Mind you, I don't think it's come out of the washing at the moment, I think it's getting water . I haven't seen it recently. Quite versatile really. Yeah, yes she wore it with a lot of you know trousers and skirts and The big thing at the moment is a new polo neck that we got from . It's actually ever such a good one. An X Together one, you know Together the label ? So Yeah. But you also buy it in, er, Alders, they've got them. . So it's normally quite expensive and it's, it's lovely material and it comes down to about here. We got it for four pound fifty. Ever so cheap. That's Oh, right, yes I've seen it, I've seen it. Well ever so often what they do they get the ex catalogue stuff. You know you can get some quite good buys like end of the season. Who are they? You get the end of season and it's if you look at the labels and go for the decent labels then you don't get sort of, quite reasonable quality. Mm. I got quite a few things in there. I'll probably have a stroll round there just to get a tracksuit for, when Michael was childrens' tracksuit. I used to, I bought loads and loads in there. Joelle? Could you just take the carrycot up and put it on the floor? Just so that it's upstairs, for me. On the floor?bedroom floor? Well I haven't cleared the cot out, so O K. it's funny cos I just I thought ooh, I'll buy it for her cos you know she doesn't four pound fifty I didn't mind. . But it actually really suits her, it's a kind of sl almost maroony red, burgundy type red, not quite and er it's a really good colour. Christine got a load of her pregnancy stuff there. Cos she said I'm not paying a fortune for stuff that I won't wear afterwards. So she bought Is there maternity clothes then? Well, if you look, yeah. Well she got a kind of raincoat, that, I don't think it's supposed to be maternity I think it's just supposed to be Oh yes, cos that was the fashion wasn't it? Yeah, yeah. So she's, she's got one there. I think she paid eight pound for it, and it, it looks raincoat . And it still fits, it still fits over the hump. But she's huge. I really got away with it, you know. I, didn't have a coat right the way through. Mm. when it rains, that's all. Really lucky. she hasn't got a car, or anything. She's Oh, dear. So she has to walk round well, Chris sold his car didn't he cos they want to save up and get a house. Even through the snow I survived. Very lucky. Cos I refused to go out and buy a coat. I used to wear one I had a jumper that my mum knitted that went wrong and ended up twice the size it should have been. But that came in useful. Yeah. Well, when Mandy was when I was pregnant with Mandy I used to wear this old, you know those rabbit skin coats coney coat what they're called? Fur coat thing. Mm. Well it was a kind of fur coat but it was rabbit I think, it was. I got one, ooh, well it was really fashionable then so it was quite beautiful sixteen years ago. was that the development strategy for Greater York from ninety six to two thousand and six should be based on agreed sites within and on the periphery of the built up area, and that the residual requirement be met for the development of a new settlement or settlements located beyond the outer boundary erm of the greenbelt, a quite clearly there's a major policy implication there that a new settlement was not acceptable within the greenbelt but would have to be er outside the outer boundary of the greenbelt, and the public consultation on that er study er attracted widespread support for a new settlement strategy in Greater York, all six authorities agreed that that was the direction er that had to be taken, it also had another benefit in that it enabled work on the York greenbelt local plan erm to proceed and that has now been taken forward to the stage where the enquiry terminated in May, it's a joint enquiry in the greenbelt local plan enquiry, with a Southern Ryedale local plan enquiry in April ninety three, and we would hope that the inspectors report on that six month enquiry, when he considered all the objections to the er greenbelt proposals of the County Council, largely supported by the er District Council will be available er in the near future. The County Council also accepted as part of this oral approach that there was a need for an alteration to the structure plan, because the approved structure plan did not make provision for a new settlement as an element of approved North Yorkshire strategic policy, and we've progressed that erm alteration through to the examination er in public er today. So the current position is that there's been substantial progress er in Greater York, and I think its testimony to the willingness of the Greater York authorities to work together there that there's been such a level of agreement I think probably er never before achieved in the Greater York area as to the direction that Greater York erm er should take. We think that on balance we have er the majority of the support of the public at large within Greater York, that this is the strategic er approach that is necessary for Greater York, it's necessary to protect the greenbelt and it's necessary to protect communities and villages er in and around erm Greater York. Could I also say one thing finally, and that is the fact that we've tried to run together the alteration and the greenbelt local plan as concurrently er as possible, er it would appear that the timing erm is coming together reasonably satisfactorily erm in that we hope that the report from the greenbelt local plan enquiry, is not to er far distant, erm and we would expect, sir, that you will be reporting on the proceedings at this examination in public er in the not to distant future, well I think I did give an undertaking at the greenbelt local plan enquiry that the County Council, because the two are er interrelated to a degree, that I would expect the County Council would not wish to pursue either report er until er the other er is available, and that seems to the County Council to be entirely sensible, that the two reports, the structure plan alteration and the greenbelt local plan enquiry, erm should be looked at together. There we are, sir, that's erm er er a very brief history erm of erm er of the new settlement strategy, erm it's one clear that the County Council thinks is the appropriate way erm er for the Greater York area er to proceed. Thank you. Thank you. I noted, and we've already had the flavour of it, in to some respect today, that initially you had almost unanimity of support from the District Councils er York City have changed their view erm and equally Hambledon are very luke warm, if I put it no more than that, er on the idea of a new settlement in the sense that they probably support the principle of the new settlement, but not in Hambledon. But could you comment, and no doubt Mr Curtis will also want to amplify why York er seem to have cooled on the idea. There is a there is reference in your paper to that. Yes. Peter Davis, North Yorkshire County Council. I mean York City Council will obviously er Mr Curtis will obviously give his views on the situation, erm the particular issue that seems to have changed the mind of York City Council is the reference in P P G thirteen, transport to sizes of new settlement not being erm er desirable in in in transport terms, small scale resettlements. Now there is no definition of what's small erm erm is erm in er P P G er thirteen and perhaps Mr Curtis could help us in due course erm on an assumption that the new settlement was somewhat larger that th what the County Council is proposing, whether that would erm change the view of York City Council, I I think there is another factor again I could be corrected on this by Mr Curtis and this tended to come out in the greenbelt local plan enquiry, er and that York City Council seem progressively to place more importance on peripheral development than on the new settlement strategy Mhm. erm that is my general feeling for erm erm erm the position, York's emerging views erm at the greenbelt local plan enquiry erm weren't shared by the districts er which surround the city, or by the County Council. Strictly on P P G two terms er because of the effect er on the greenbelt, but I wouldn't want to go any further than that, that's my impression, Mr Curtis will undoubtably correct me if I'm wrong. Yes, I mean I noticed from the draft P P G thirteen that they do not define small. How small is small? Mr Curtis, do you want to Yes, thank you, Chair. come back on that? David Curtis, York City Council. Erm, clearly their is a a long history of cooperation between the authorities on Greater York, and er I think it is important to explain the development of thinking on that, and the reasons why the City Council has, I would say progressively, er reduced its er the warmth of its enthusiasm to such a state that it's actually become extremely cold now. The original dispersed development strategy ended up with a shortfall, something like two thousand dwellings, compared to the sites which had been agreed between the various authorities at the time, it's also worth noting that that was based on a dwelling target of nine thousand one hundred for Greater York, I think that's correct, over the period since actual sites which have been agreed between the authorities since then have clearly increased, so as you've seen in my appendix eight the residual requirement has now been reduced to a a level of nine hundred and forty seven. The eighty nine strategy was actually supported by four of the authorities including the County Council, but clearly, and I fully appreciate why that decision was made two districts particularly, Ryedale and Selby, felt unable to support the strategy. The City Council, faced with the view that er there was two thousand shortfall in dwellings, that clearly two of our most important neighbours in terms of their land area were unhappy with that proposal, agreed to er proceed to pursue the issue of the new settlement. In that interim period of that work the draft P P G three came out, and made it quite clear that the new settlement would have to lie without beyond the outer edge of the greenbelt, and that was a fur a further consideration. Since that time clearly we've also had a series of further er indications development government guidance on the issue, new P P G one, three, and twelve all produced in March ninety two, which made it quite clear the environmental considerations were to be given greater attention in development plans. P P G three, the revised P P G three when it came out clearly, in my opinion changes the emphasis from the draft P P G three from the draft P P G three, paragraphs thirty two and thirty three which I would emphasize should to be read together, clearly indicates that new settlements are as someone said this morning, sorry, earlier in the discussion today, an issue of last resort. This has further emphasized to ourselves with, I accept our reading of the draft of P P G thirteen, and also more work we've been doing on land in the city, and on the potential traffic implications in particular of further growth outside the ring road. All of those factors lead the City Council to the view that the current level of residual given emerging government advice, the City Council could no longer support the idea of a new settlement of something like fourteen hundred dwellings set in the countryside beyond the outer edge of the York greenbelt. It's interesting to note that actually now we've since made that decision the residual has as I've said come down to nine four seven, so if we do have a new settlement of fourteen hundred we're already ending up with a a higher level of proposed development for Greater York now, the nine seven would obviously be exceeded if we had a fourteen hundred new settlement within Greater York. The further out from York the new settlement goes the less self contained it will be, the more the tendency will be for travel into the city, which is the main service centre to be car based. The belief of the City Council is that, notwithstanding there are clearly difficult traffic problems in the city, there is more opportunity to encourage people to use other more environmentally friendly modes of travel by locating development in and on the edge of the main urban area, a view that's supported by P P G thirteen and the research document onto planning, transport and planning emis planning and transport emissions on which it was based. It's for those reasons, sir, that the City Council feels that it can no longer support the proposed proposals for new settlement, just to come to your question about the issue of scale, I am not able to define what er small is in P P G three, it's obviously been left deliberately vague, but I would draw your attention to the Ucwetec T P A study I've just referred to which makes it quite clear in their terms that to be self contained in transport terms the nearest any settlement ne really needs to be in excess of twenty thousand people. Now I could not countenance, and I'm sure none of the authorities around us could countenance a new settlement that scale in Greater York. If you compare a fourteen hundred new settlement, three thousand people with the new settlements around York, as you've seen in our papers, and some of the papers circulating, it's very similar in size to many of the expanded villages around York, which are all, virtually without exception, commuter settlements for the urban area, so the inevitable consequence of that size of new settlement, in my opinion, be it fourteen hundred, be it two thousand five hundred dwellings, it will be primarily a large housing estate set in the open countryside. On that basis the City Council is doesn't feel able to support to support that proposal. Thank you. Can we have the County Council's response to that? Mr Davis, do you want to make any comment on that? Er yes I do, erm Before I return to other people. I really don't want to hog the debate because I know there are other No it's alright, alright . But certainly one, three things I'd like to respond to erm erm mm Mr Curtis. First of all erm he justified his view on environmental considerations as as considered by the City Council, I think we would say, the County Council, that one of the main considerations that has brought us to the conclusion that we have are environmental considerations, the environment of York and its immeding immediate surroundings, the protection er of the York greenbelt, environmental considerations have been er at the most er in our minds. But if I may interrupt, how do you cope with the argument that Mr Curtis was making that if your settlement is, say, less than two and a half thousand it is no more than a large housing estate which relies on the centre of York for its functions, of service, shopping, entertainment, and therefore that the difference between that the difference between a new settlement beyond the greenbelt and peripheral development, in those terms, is no different. Well Mr Curtis of course is erm is what I would describe as using inflammatory descriptions to try and do down what's going to happen with a a new settlement, erm he seems to be convinced that what we're going to end up with er in Greater York is a development of the sort of er er character that he has described, it would be the clear intention of the local authorities to ensure that an appropriate self contained community erm er is developed, now erm there is no re Is that really feasible at that level? Can, sorry, can I I don't want to stray into item matter B . Mm, mm. if we can at this stage I just want to get the concept of Yes, yes. of the thing clear. Is it really feasible that at the sort of level that's being talked about, be it your level or the level being put forward by some of the objectors to the structure plan, the new settlement could actually hope to provide a good level of comparison shopping, for example? Well can we make it absolutely clear that no settlement, anywhere, er in North Yorkshire, or in York and Humberside probably is self contained. If you want to en try and ensure that you're going to have a self sustained community, one hundred percent, you make sure that presumably you've got a show case cinema with fifteen screens there, er a B and Q, erm a whole range of of facilities that nobody ever needs leave, erm erm erm er that new settlement, the reality of the real world of course is that all settlements to a greater or lesser degree, er have a relationship with other er larger scale settlements, now then let's look at the new settlement, fourteen hundred dwellings, we estimate that that is going to be of the order of around three thousand three hundred people, now that is sizeable, it is not small, it is larger than a number of the small market towns er in North Yorkshire, like Boroughbridge, Settle, it is a significant development erm erm and within it erm there will be a requirement er be a requirement for a a a primary school, it justifies that. Certainly we cannot provide a fully one hundred percent sustainable community, you'd be talking about some vast city to move towards that, erm the re the real world is that the the hierarchy of settlements, erm all settlements, have greater or lesser degree of facilities depending on their size, and there'll be no difference er to the new settlement, and I think to to run an argument on the basis of Mr Curtis er has run it is unfair to the concept of the new settlement. Thank you Mr Davis, I, I Well there were two other points Chairman. Yes go on. Erm, the the reference of last resort was Mr Thomas's reference erm it it is not a reference which I think you find anywhere er in government guidance, and I think what P P G thre three says is the opportunity to to pursue them will be relatively rare, we think this is a relatively rare circumstance, er in North Yorkshire, it's unique, er and it's entirely driven er by justifiable er reasons to protect the the wider environment of Greater York. The third thing, and I gu would have to say it's a bit of a red herring thrown out by Mr Curtis is the issue of traffic growth con concern on traffic growth. Could I say to you that in terms of Greater York the County Council is the highway authority, the County Surveyor advises the County Council on traffic implications as a concept, the County Councillors highway authority is satisfied with the merits er of a new settlement. I won't go any further, because I know there are other flags up rou round the room, Chairman. Ca can I say, I'm attempting to stick with two A er, I think I'll take Mr Grantham, and then we'll adjourn for lunch. But would you gentlemen who have flagged that you want to speak leave those flags up? Alright? Mr Grantham. Er, er, John Grantham, C P R E. Er, sir, at the risk of straying slightly into into two B, you, do forgive me in advance, but you raised the specific point about size, and and erm there was er one or two statements that there isn't a a clear view on size in P P G three, I think it's important to to bear in mind the interrelationship between all P P G s and as Mr Curtis said, the research that that backs them up, and I I I point you to three quotes in the statement that C P R E have put in, erm i i i paragraph four point one seven,an and s the quote that attaches to that is taken from the research that erm er backs up draft revised P P G thirteen, transport, and erm I shall quote from that on this question of size,i it is also evident that smaller settlements, those with populations of less than fifty thousand, but particularly very small settlements are characteristically less transport emissions efficient than larger settlements, I think the the erm essence of of that particular piece of research is not as Mr Davis was implying to achieve totally self contained settlements, I don't believe such a concept exists, it's actually erm a planning land use in the long term to reduce C O two emi emissions something that is essential now to government policy, I think perhaps more instructive though is is the quote that I've in included in paragraph four point one nine and that's taken from er er this book here which I perhaps should submit the whole chapter in evidence to to the panel, I've only just included one quote, it's it's I suggest one of the more interesting reads that you may have as a result of this panel, it's by Colin Ward, and it's called New Town, Home Town, it's undertaken by er, sorry includes some of the work that's been undertaken by the University of Reading, erm and er David Lock Associates, on erm er new town research, and this this is due to be published by H M S O shortly, it's unfortunate that it wasn't available in time for this E I P, but I think erm, if you'll bear with me, I will read out the quote that I put in four point one nine, because I feel that it is useful on this question of of size, we concluded that if you are interested in environmental impact, energy conser consumption, and sustainability, new settlements have to reach a certain size to be worthwhile, it's parallel to the old arguments that used to take place around self containment in new towns, we found that new settlements of much less than five thousand houses, that's about fourteen thousand people are not really worthwhile because if they are smaller than that you are simply putting a housing estate in the countryside, a phrase that that has already been put round this morning, it appears that the best minimum for a new settlement, the best minimum, is about ten thousand houses, that's that's twenty five thousand people, which as it happens is about the size of the original garden cities. Starting from the logic of sustainability, we end up with a very similar size for a new community to the one that Howard was writing about a hundred years ago. I erm think that that is quite useful research that has been undertaken for government, and it it has been carried through, er as I'm sure everybody is aware, into the U K strategy for sustainable development, the consultation period of which is just concluding, erm I won't take you any more of the panel's time to read that quote as it's written in my in my statement. Yes, I I we have read it, we have read it. Er obviously, I mean the new towns movement as conceived immediately after the war was geared to meeting London housing needs, you know, we're not comparing like with like, but I think, I take the point that you are making in terms of er sustainability. Mr Spittle Mr Spittle. to say something. Malcolm Spittle, County Councillor. I was very interested to read this quote from David Lock, erm of David Lock associates, and I just wonder how it squares from the fact that er Mr Lock associates submitted an objection to H two on the grounds they wanted a settlement of eighteen hundred dwellings to the North of York. Erm, it does seem to be something of a contradiction in terms there, and in fact Mr Lock isn't here today because his clients have subsequently withdrawn from the er E I P but er it would have been interesting to have asked him the question. On that note, I think you should you should go and refresh yourselves. Can we, can we reconvene at two o'clock, please. Ah there we are,. Right abdominal wound, she's a wee bit confused. She didn't bother to tell me that she'd only got to call you, right? Erm she wasn't in her nightdress but she only dressed herself, she said And you She said she went to buy something herself, she phoned the clinic and the clinic . She's here and says she should be fortnightly . So I don't know whether you want to go and see her rather than, I could get a doctor to go and see her and phone,. it's just that I'm never gonna get to up to. ? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. erm, first twelve weeks pregnant so should I mark at the bottom when she types . Erm this one. Right Mr Gordon I think the room is now as full as it can get so we'll kick off today's proceedings er could you start by introducing your team for the record. Yes of course it will be a pleasure. I'm Jack Gordon, I'm Director General of aircraft one with the Ministry of Defence. I'm the Project Manager for the United Kingdom er for the Eurofighter two thousand project at the international level I also chair the N E F M O board of directors. On my left is Mr William Perry who's the Director of Finance and Secretariat, air one in the procurement executive. On my right is Mr er Nick Evans who's the Head of Resources and Programmes Air and on my extreme right Group Captain Granville White who's Deputy Director, Operational Requirements air four. Right thank you very much Mr Gordon. Er can I just say at the outset that some of the material we'll be covering this morning may well be classified. Yes. Er when you feel that you can't answer our questions in open session, if you could indicate that then we will go into closed session at the end of the morning and cover that ground in that way. Understood. Looking first of all then at the operational performance of the aircraft, you have told us already in written answers that in the light of the changed security situation you have relaxed the Eurofighter requirement. Can you tell us an indication of how much the changes reduce operational capability in percentage terms? Erm well perhaps before I answer that question Mr Chairman, I could just briefly skim across the programme and bring you up to date as to where we are and then we'll go directly on to that point. Very briefly would . Yes, very brief . Er well the committee will recall that shortly after it published its report in Spring ninety two, the new German Minister of Defence questioned whether the project was still required at that degree of sophistication. For our part we had no doubt about the continuing need for an aircraft of Eurofighter two thousand's broad capabilities. This view was subsequently confirmed by a thorough review of the operation requirement which was carried out under the direction of the four chiefs of defence staff. The review of the requirement and the options for meeting it er culminated in an agreement between the four ministers of defence in December ninety two to re-orientate er the project. We provided a note to the committee in January ninety three about this. Well, re-orientation of the project has involved a line by line review of the European staff requirement, the E S R D to see whether it might be relaxed in the light of the changed international security situation. It also involves rescheduling the whole programme so that decisions on commitments to production can be deferred until nineteen ninety five, with first deliveries to United Kingdom and Italy occurring in the year two thousand and to er Spain and Germany in two thousand and two. Work by the staffs in the four ministries of defence and by the NATO agency N A F M A to re-orientate the project in line with the minister's directions is now at an advance stage. The revised European staff requirement document has been signed now by the four chiefs of air staff, this was done last month. A revised schedule for the development programme has now been agreed with industry and this will be taken into the contract. The four governments are also resolved to cap their financial liabilities for this programme. So negotiations are in progress on revised prices for the development phase. These have taken somewhat longer than we anticipated but we are at last making good progress towards agreeing prices for the Eurojet contract and we are expecting to receive more acceptable price quotations from Eurofighter very shortly for their part of the work. The changes to the programme also require a new memorandum understanding with our partners. The draft for this is almost complete but it can't be finalised until the costs of the revised programme have been agreed for each of the participating nations. All being well this new M O U will be ready for submission to ministers by the middle of this year. Turning now to the development work itself in general, the development work is going well. There have been no fundamental technical problems. There has been a very considerable delay to the first flight but this is now scheduled for April this year. The delay has been due mainly to the need to be absolutely certain about the integrity of the flight control system software before the aircraft takes to the air. While the delay to the start of the flying programme has been much longer than anyone would wish, much more progress has been made in the ground and rig testing than at the comparable stage of any previous project I have been associated with and we are very satisfied indeed with the results that have been obtained so far. There is assessment in the wind tunnels, for example, is complete and the results are good. The structural test programme is also making extremely good progress and the results from the engine test programme are ex very encouraging indeed. The performance of the engine, on the bench, already meets its full specification for thrust and fuel efficiency and even it exceeds it slightly in some respects. So overall we remain very confident that the Eurofighter two thousand will meet the full operational requirement. So now turning to the point which er I think you asked us to address. Can we quantify, or explain, the areas in which we have made some relaxation and I'll ask Group Captain Granville White to answer that. Well the specific question I asked is whether you've quantified in percentage terms erm perhaps Group Captain you could give us an indication of how it has affected it? Yes certainly, yes. The point about er relaxations and what impact it would have on its combat capability. I think the important point I'd like to make at the outset is that when the review of the requirement was carried out it was carried out both nationally and on a four nation basis, the ministers, once that was complete, the ministers decided that and stated publicly in December ninety two, that we will continue with the existing airframe and engine combination and that each nation er based on a family of aircraft concept could decide from a menu which equipments it would fit according to their individual requirements and their budget and we looked individually at each of the items to see what impact it would have on the operational capability if we were to remove them and what erm was decided in the end and the requirement reflects this, was signed last month by the Chief Surveyor's staff, is that some nations have decided to remove certain items of equipment but for the U K we felt that it was necessary to keep all the major items and therefore as far as the U K is erm impact on the operational requirement is concerned, there is no significant alteration in its operational capability and therefore in overall percentage terms there is no decrease in the capability at all. Now individual nations who've decided to do without a particular item of equipment, clearly that will be developed into the aircraft and therefore they have the option to if they wish to d decide later on to fit it in. Thank you. I'll I think at least four particular areas where the United Kingdom has decided not to, as it were, take the full specification. Er, can we have a look at those or or at least, has accepted specific changes to those specifications. Can we have a look at those four and if you could, I'd be grateful if you can tell me what change in the security situation, as envisaged by the government, has led to our acceptance of those changes. Now the first one, which was mentioned by the minister in the R A F debate, er is the reduced requirement to operate on damaged runways. What change of perception in the security situation has led to our accepting that diminution of capability. Yes the there are two aspects really to that, one is the length of runway operating er and the other is the surface, erm, if I could take the first one. When the requirement was originally written erm and agreed in nineteen eighty seven all of the nations decided that erm we required a short take off and landing capability and that was based on the sort of the then cold war situation where the prospects of runways and airfields being very severely damaged in a sort of central European type of scenario, and therefore the possibility that there might be only very small operating strips available from those runways and that was the basis for the particular length that was decided at the time. Because of the changed security situation and that type of er conflict not being envisaged in the same way now, what we felt was important was to be able to operate er apart from main operating bases, but also from sort of general purpose erm strips, flying clubs and those type of smaller airfields and therefore rather than looking at the damaged runway situation, we looked at the smaller strips and took a length that we could sensibly operate from erm and took that as the yardstick but clearly notwithstanding that, there is the prospect of damaged runways and therefore the slight relaxation would also apply to damaged runways but perhaps damaged to a lesser extent. I think perhaps if I just add a point to that er although we have as four nations agreed on the revised requirement there, I believe it's true to say that development has progressed to such an extent that probably we will have the original requirement in practice, even though we've no longer specified it. That's very encouraging. For no extra charge. Can we then look at the reduced engine thrust erm this presumably would have a significant impact on combat performance, er why is there any change in the security situation that would warrant such a a relaxation? Yes the particular item that was deleted was known as the combat override facility which erm was really a trade off erm to provide extra thrust against the reduced life of the engine and clearly if one operates at the top end of the engine spectrum in er hotter conditions and higher er R P M then clearly the life of the engine will be reduced. Now we had originally had this extra facility available er so that we could trade off life against the extra thrust in an emergency but there was clearly the possibility erm that that might be used er when it really wasn't necessary and we would end up with extra costs, extra life cycle costs, shorter engine life and it was felt on balance that with a reduced threat overall that it was sensible to take out that facility and to accept a longer engine life, but not, there's no reduction in the total normal thrust but its merely its override combat facility. I it doesn't speak very highly if I may say so Group Captain, for R A F discipline if what you're telling me and telling the committee that you think that pilots should be using this facility, would be using this facility when they're ordered not to. No I wasn't suggesting that Mr Chairman. Well why would it be used in circumstances when it was not needed otherwise? I was only thinking really of erm particularly extreme situations erm and I would expect it to be used for example in normal training or anything like that and er certainly all the studies show that the normal thrust, full thrust that was available was sufficient to meet the threat and this extra capability really was a a sort of an extra that was added in early on and really wasn't felt on any of the combat modelling to be necessary. I think I would actually like to pursue that point Group Captain but I I think I'd rather pursue it in in the closed session than an open session. Now can we move on to the reduced quantities of role equipment. Can you tell us what role equipment items have been deleted. Yes, it was not so much a deletion as er a reduction in the numbers because we were very mindful erm in going through the requirement erm and not making significant changes as far as the U K was concerned and we needed to make some savings in cost if at all possible and therefore we carried out a very comprehensive review of all the items of role equipment such as drop tanks er pylons, explosive release units and those type of things which had been provisionally earmarked for a very high intensive and fairly long running conflict and it was felt that if we were to make some savings then it was a sensible balance to reduce those numbers on the basis that we could save some money in the programme but at the same time many of these items could be bought later on at relatively short notice, clearly not within a conflict but in the years to come. on that point. Erm as far as the drop tanks are concerned, does that have any impact on the range or are you just talking about the numbers that you will have spare? They're purely on on the numbers, the same er stand, the different sizes would still be available, there would merely be fewer of them in total stocks. But would you envisage that the numbers er of aircraft actually kitted out with these things have been reduced or are you talking about having spares in case they get lost or damaged? No the the very name, as the name implies, in many cases we would er jettison the drop tanks before entering combat and er therefore there is an agreed rate at which we would expect to use them so that they are a a usable stock in operations . and in training presumably do you drop them in training or do you not? No, not normally, no. So it's only operational. Yes. And can you give an indication of how quickly these things could be ordered in an emergency? Perhaps I can take that one er Group Captain. Once the erm drop tanks have been developed and have entered production in most of the lead time one associates with providing a capability has er has actually been avoided so we could re-order probably within a year. Very reassuring Mr Gordon, I, we're not necessarily gonna have a year's warning that that we're going to need these aircraft in the event of war. Well, that of course er may be true but er as the Group Captain has has said here in the reduced er spec position which we now face and judgement was taken as to how much we should invest in stocks of reserve drop tanks at this point and the option exists to order more. Can I ask it's absolutely meaningless to me, do you mean a month, three months, nine months, eleven months, eleven and a half months, what do you mean? No what I mean is that er once the item is in production if you wish to order another hundred drop tanks or another thousand drop tanks if you make that order then approximately one year later you would receive deliveries of those tanks against that order. Now that would be the normal peacetime lead time if we could accelerate that in industry and find some way of doing it then it may well be possible to do in quicker time than that. So in approximately one year you might be fourteen months or fifteen months? I I'm er quoting a hypothetical situation here that we have entered production with er production line for drop tanks maybe producing two, three thousand tanks against a projected usage for the next ten years and sometime during that period we decide you want to order an additional thousand tanks two thousand tanks then you could adjust the rate at which the deliveries occur, you could adjust the the the total quantity and with about a years notice industry can get in the materials and produce the goods for you. Does that answer your question? If er there was a crisis and there was a need for a rush order er one would be talking of weeks for something that is predesigned to start coming off the production line. experience during the Falklands war and during Gulf war indicated that once an item was in production tremendous acceleration is possible in the real war situation. Yes. I was discussing a year for a normal peacetime lead time. Presumably drop tanks aren't lost very often in peace time, it's operations that you've actually jettisoned, is that right? That is absolutely right, correct. Bruce George. Thank you,i do you feel a little uneasy at changing operational requirements based on er an assessment of a threat in nineteen ninety two, ninety three, which I presume would have to remain valid until two thousand and twenty. So how confident are you that potential adversaries will not have the capability in two thousand and twenty to make a mess of our runways as the Soviets would have done during the er the cold war? Erm I'm asking this question to e satisfy myself that these changes and reduction in costs are not the result of political expediency as opposed to er a genuine assessment of what the risk in the change environment is likely to be. fine. That is precisely the background to the study which was conducted by the four chiefs of defence staff, they were asking that kind of question and I'll now ask the Group Captain to respond. Yes er I think perhaps the point I'd like to emphasis is that the increase er in runway length is really quite a modest one er and therefore it hasn't had an enormous impact. Well the answer is yes but of course landing and taking off on a road is one thing, being able to operate is another one because clearly one needs er fuel, weapons, ground crew and the like but landing on a road in itself is is not difficult. Peter My I move to er questions about the er comparison between the erm Eurofighter and other fighters it might find itself in combat with. Well Peter I'm sorry but the notice only said once,Winston is meant to lead us into that I'm sorry. Right I'm sorry . Winston Churchill. When you updated er the combat analysis using the latest data on Eurofighter did you again compare er Eurofighter with alternatives such as an updated F sixteen or F fifteen er previous combat modelling showed that an alternative aircraft er apart from the F twenty two, did not approach the capability of Eurofighter. Did the latest modelling confirm this and what is the next best alternative in terms of capability. Right, Group Captain Granville White. Yes wh when they reported to the committee two years ago erm I explained that there was combat modelling going on at at the time and indeed that was completed by the end of nineteen ninety two and it showed that er of all the alternatives available then Eurofighter two thousand was the most cost effective solution to the R A F's requirements and yet it would it would not be able to meet up er to the F twenty two but other than that it was superior to all other aircraft. At the moment erm because of the extra time we've got available because production investment has been delayed because of ministerial decisions, we've set in train three further studies and they will look collectively at alternatives, comparison in combat modelling and also in the numbers and if I could describe those three very briefly because I think they're the they're relevant to what we're talking about. The the two, initially there are two studies which will look into numbers, one of those is a top downs study which is based on scenarios and will look at erm a variety of different situations around the world from an analytical point of view. The second one is erm a bottom up study which is based on today's commitments but projecting them forward into the timescale in which we will have the aircraft and looking in that way to see how many and and in what way we would need them. The third one focusing in specifically on the combat modelling is what is known as a C O E I A which is a combined operational effectiveness and investment appraisal and this work is being carried out at Farnborough and we're comparing in single roles and multi-role Eurofighter two thousand against different aircraft. So for example, in the specialist air defence er side we're looking at alternatives would be the F twenty two erm the current tornado F three and also an upgraded variant of the F three. In the ground attack side we're comparing it to the jaguar that it'll replace, the harrier G R seven and also the tornado G R four and then in the multi-role arena for air defence, air superiority and attack we're comparing our aircraft against the French Raphall the American F eighteen E which is the the future variant of the F eighteen, the F fifteen E, the multi-role but primarily air to surface machine and also the F sixteen C. Those are the ones we're currently looking at. As the cost of Eurofighter increases does there come a point where like the F twenty two i it becomes unaffordable and by how much would the performance of Eurofighter have to be degraded before it becomes equivalent to the nearest alternative? I wonder if I could answer that in a in a different way because clearly rather there's the option, rather than reduction the operational capability which was really the er initiative that had begun in nineteen ninety two, there is the option of course of er adjusting the total numbers and that would er have an overall bearing on the total programme cost but cert because certainly the judgement of the er the chiefs of staff was that er as far as the U K was concerned then we we should retain the operational capability as I explained earlier an n and not decrease it in any significant extent because if we did that then we could end up er with an inferior capability against a potential threat. During the last year erm when we were working on the requirement, we carried out a number of erm comparisons descoping or aircraft in various respects. For example taking out the forward looking infra-red, infra-red search and track, taking out the the M I D S, the multiple information distribution system and certain aspects of the er defensive aids, to see what impact that would have and we found that if we removed any one of those erm then we would either come down to parity against potential threat or possibly er inferiority and that was really the supporting evidence to retain the full capability. But Group Captain are you saying that as er a platform it has not been degraded at all, there's basically no change in thrust, in turn rate or in airframe G loading? Yes, that's correct. Thank you. Peter was your question answered or not? No in the air superiority role I didn't hear a comparison with the S U thirty five or the Fulcrum M E twenty nine S er are there any other aircraft of er perhaps comparable capacity with which you did not compare Eurofighter? What we've done,won one of the points I think that is worth er making perhaps is that on er over the last few years we've seen a complete change in world export philosophy where not only are the Russians exporting all over the place but clearly er there are a number of western aircraft in different parts of the world and therefore what we have also done is to, in comparing er our aircraft against other western ones, we've also looked at them as potential threats because it's possible that er erm western aircraft in certain hands could end up being used against us so we have also compared those. But the question that young pilots would want to know the answer to is this, erm are there aircraft anywhere in the world with which you have not made a comparison in terms of air superiority? No, there are none. So you have compared with the And the S U? Yes we've compared with everything and specifically the ones you've mentioned, the S U thirty five and the which is an upgraded S U twenty seven and the M I G twenty nine S, yes we've specifically compared against those two. And you've been reassured by the responses? Yes. Thank you Chairman. Thank you, Michael Colgan Yes Mr Chairman I'm not clear erm about something that Mr Gordon said in his opening remarks that I'd like clarified and that is that he gave the committee the impression that there were er certain of the of the partners that were accepting erm a lower specification in other words, omitting from the what is the British best if you like, erm certain items of of equipment in order to reduce cost of the aircraft, both in development stage and at the production stage, final cost of the aircraft, unit cost. Erm we asked the question about the aircraft's reduced operational capabilities as far as Britain is concerned, we were told that there was no reduction, erm there was no percentage figure that could be produced but w now what about the other countries, I mean, which countries are asking for what to be omitted and by how much is the percentage, in percentage terms er is the performance of the aircraft reduced in those cases and further on from that, picking up something that that Wing Com er Group Captain Granville White has just mentioned which i is the question of sales. Yes. Erm it does obviously have a bearing on sales to the third countries when the er aircraft is in production. Do I get the impression that we're basically building a a basic aircraft with optional extras, or are we building an aircraft which can be, to some degree, sanitised because obviously there are some parts of the specification of the aircraft we may not wish third cra countries to have. It's a well known fact that aircraft are sold all around the world, this can have a bearing on the capability and also a bearing on their cost and therefore saleability. Perhaps, from those remarks, it's hardly a question but perhaps you could just clarify Yes. my er thinking on on the on what you said in opening remarks which don't make it clear to me whether we've got a basic aircraft with optional extras or a fully specified aircraft from which we can dat deleted certain items of equipment. Erm, well I think I can reassure that it is the latter. The development programme for the aircraft will provide the broad range of capabilities which was asked for by all four nations originally and er the fact that one or more nations may have deleted its requirement for a particular facility doesn't remove the need for us to complete the development work er because we still have at least one or two customers for that facility. So it's definitely the latter, we are developing a fully capable Eurofighter two thousand aircraft and if erm any of our four participating nations do not want a particular facility then we will make provision for them to leave that out in production and if an export customer does not require the full range of capabilities we can also remove them for that export customer. But by how much could we degrade the aircraft and still be capable of erm competing with erm other aircraft in in the market? Well I I I would prefer to perhaps follow this one up in the closed session later but erm. we we'll pursue that er in private. Neville Trotter. going to go into service in the next century, it's going to be around till well into the next century. Very briefly what would it do that the present generation of aircraft won't, how is it a quantum leap ahead? Fine, I will again invite the the Group Captain to answer that. Perhaps I could er answer that in er I think there are probably four points that er come out to my mind erm the first one in the airframe engine combination, a very high degree of agility. The ability to be able to pull nine G which is er generally accepted to be the physiological limit for pilots, which is more than any of our aircraft can . What can we do now by contrast? Er, none of our aircraft can pull more than seven G, normal aircraft. There's also a close correlation by not just the erm the size of the number for G, but how long can it go on pulling that G given the thrust and the aerodynamic capabilities of the machine and we are essentially building this aircraft so that it can sustain nine G and we are providing the pilot with the sort of equipment he requires to be able to survive in that kind of environment. Is this for a dog fight? Yes, yes. . Th it has er a considerable negative G capability as well. Would it be able, er pulling that erm G to compete with the with the harrier using the technique? Erm Group Captain Granville White. The simple answer is yes. Er so I think the first of my four points is the is the airframe agility, clearly the the ability to m manoeuvre. The second erm is is and perhaps is related in a way er in the air to air weapons where erm in older missiles have had what is known as sort of bore sight capability where they go in the direction of the aircraft. Clearly to have the combination of an off bore sight capability for a a missile such as A S R A A M, the er advance short range air to air missile, the combination of the agility of the weapon and the flat platform together has been shown to be really needed, you can't have one without the other and that somebody who has only agility in the aircraft or agility in the in the weapon, will lose against somebody who has it in both. So I think that's the probably the sort of related point. Moving on into the sort of sensors and the electronics side, erm for survivability erm the defensive aid sub- system will be er very complex, very sophisticated but also integrated so that it has a complete system of protection for the aircraft, erm an and finally moving on on the sort of electronics side then clearly with different sensors such as the radar, the forward looking infra-red, infra-red search and track the er multiple information distribution system and also certain aspects of the er electronic warfare suite then by having sensor fusion which enables the best information at any one time to be correlated into the system as a whole then that will provide a very good capability and far in excess of anything that we have at the moment. Thank you very much. I'll ask Campbell to take us on into the question of the role of this aircraft. We understand that some new weapons, not previously in the specification, are to be included. Are you able to tell us in open session what sort of weapons are envisaged? Erm perhaps I can invite my colleague from the office of management and budgets to speak to that one. Erm chairman yes we hope to to erm, excuse me, to erm that E four will be capable of er sorry E F two thousand will be capable of handling all our erm planned weapons er which are already in our programme the er conventional er, the C A S O M, the conventionally armed, stand-off missile, the er anti- armour missile er twelve thirty eight and the future medium range air-to-air missile er whatever that happens to be er as a result of er competition. What about the low level laser guided bomb, is that also included in this? Yes it is. Erm does the fact of erm using the aircraft to er provide a platform for these systems, er tell us something about a change in view about the role or operating concept of the aircraft? Erm Group Captain Granville White . thank you Erm not not change erm with envisagement . Widen Wi certainly broaden, we've we've envisaged from the outset that the aircraft would be both will be multi- role capable and that erm all that the primary design driver will be the air-to-air air superiority role but the air-to-surface role would be almost an equal, clearly one has to have a a prioritisation and those particular weapons in the air-to-surface side, the conventional armed stand off missile along the low level er low level laser guided bomb and the future anti armour weapon, they clearly erm really take the weaponeering side into the next century. We will still have the ability to carry today's weapons such as the the L seven five five cluster bomb unit, the thousand pound bomb erm and the C R V seven rocket and things like that but clearly as we move forward into the century it's important that as the platform progresses then so does the aircraft. Are the any weapons er which the aircraft er would not be able to , for example the J P two three three closely associated with the tornado, er is that a system which you would anticipate Eurofighter two thousand to be able to carry? No, it it's too large and too heavy and really that is a different role that's more the role for the tornado G L one, G L four. And I think you mentioned thousand pounds bombs. Yes. Is that the, is that the limit could anything heavier than that It's , no it's not the limit er the limit of weight, it can carry er heavier ones. You may not wish to say in open session . I think probably as you . in closed session. Yes, it's probably more appropriate. Erm I was rather interested by the comparisons which you explained a little earlier in the evidence erm if you've got an aircraft which is er going to replace, as I understand it the Jaguar and the Phantom which has already been retired,er against which you've been comparing the F three er and the G R four of the tornados and the harriers, then er that gives rise in my mind to the possibility that this is an aircraft which might replace all of these, in which case will that have consequences for the still er publicly declared intention to order two hundred and fifty, might we order more for example? Mr Evans. Erm as you say Mr Campbell er the plan at the moment is that the F two thousand will replace jaguar and the tornado A D V F three aircraft and the scope er of replacing other aircraft er remains under consideration, er provisional off take of two fifty er was declared at the d the start of the development phase and of course our work share in development is based on that number. Before we seek authorisation for the production phase, it will be necessary for each nation to restate or modify it's planned off take and that will be done very firmly on the basis of the studies which er Group Captain Granville White has already d described which will factor in er against our military tasks, which is,y you know we define now fairly clearly, er exactly what aircraft are needed to undertake those tasks in what scenarios and in the future er as you say, there may well be scope for er adding additional aircraft types to that. Well I think I understand that answer to be an affirmative, that if this aircraft is capable risk in the change environment is likely to be. fine. That is precisely the background to the study which was conducted by the four chiefs of defence staff, they were asking that kind of question and I'll now ask the Group Captain to respond. Yes er I think perhaps the point I'd like to emphasis is that the increase er in runway length is really quite a modest one er and therefore it hasn't had an enormous impact. Well the answer is yes but of course landing and taking off on a road is one thing, being able to operate is another one because clearly one needs er fuel, weapons, ground crew and the like but landing on a road in itself is is not difficult.

What we've done,won one of the points I think that is worth er making perhaps is that on er over the last few years we've seen a complete change in world export philosophy where not only are the Russians exporting all over the place but clearly er there are a number of western aircraft in different parts of the world and therefore what we have also done is to, in comparing er our aircraft against other western ones, we've also looked at them as potential threats because it's possible that er erm western aircraft in certain hands could end up being used against us so we have also compared those. But the question that young pilots would want to know the answer to is this, erm are there aircraft anywhere in the world with which you have not made a comparison in terms of air superiority? No, there are none. So you have compared with the And the S U? Yes we've compared with everything and specifically the ones you've mentioned, the S U thirty five and the which is an upgraded S U twenty seven and the M I G twenty nine S, yes we've specifically compared against those two. And you've been reassured by the responses? Yes. Thank you Chairman. Thank you, Michael Colgan Yes Mr Chairman I'm not clear erm about something that Mr Gordon said in his opening remarks that I'd like clarified and that is that he gave the committee the impression that there were er certain of the of the partners that were accepting erm a lower specification in other words, omitting from the what is the British best if you like, erm certain items of of equipment in order to reduce cost of the aircraft, both in development stage and at the production stage, final cost of the aircraft, unit cost. Erm we asked the question about the aircraft's reduced operational capabilities as far as Britain is concerned, we were told that there was no reduction, erm there was no percentage figure that could be produced but w now what about the other countries, I mean, which countries are asking for what to be omitted and by how much is the percentage, in percentage terms er is the performance of the aircraft reduced in those cases and further on from that, picking up something that that Wing Com er Group Captain Granville White has just mentioned which i is the question of sales. Yes. Erm it does obviously have a bearing on sales to the third countries when the er aircraft is in production. Do I get the impression that we're basically building a a basic aircraft with optional extras, or are we building an aircraft which can be, to some degree, sanitised because obviously there are some parts of the specification of the aircraft we may not wish third cra countries to have. It's a well known fact that aircraft are sold all around the world, this can have a bearing on the capability and also a bearing on their cost and therefore saleability. Perhaps, from those remarks, it's hardly a question but perhaps you could just clarify Yes. my er thinking on on the on what you said in opening remarks which don't make it clear to me whether we've got a basic aircraft with optional extras or a fully specified aircraft from which we can dat deleted certain items of equipment. Erm, well I think I can reassure that it is the latter. The development programme for the aircraft will provide the broad range of capabilities which was asked for by all four nations originally and er the fact that one or more nations may have deleted its requirement for a particular facility doesn't remove the need for us to complete the development work er because we still have at least one or two customers for that facility. So it's definitely the latter, we are developing a fully capable Eurofighter two thousand aircraft and if erm any of our four participating nations do not want a particular facility then we will make provision for them to leave that out in production and if an export customer does not require the full range of capabilities we can also remove them for that export customer. But by how much could we degrade the aircraft and still be capable of erm competing with erm other aircraft in in the market? Well I I I would prefer to perhaps follow this one up in the closed session later but erm. we we'll pursue that er in private. Neville Trotter. going to go into service in the next century, it's going to be around till well into the next century. Very briefly what would it do that the present generation of aircraft won't, how is it a quantum leap ahead? Fine, I will again invite the the Group Captain to answer that. Perhaps I could er answer that in er I think there are probably four points that er come out to my mind erm the first one in the airframe engine combination, a very high degree of agility. The ability to be able to pull nine G which is er generally accepted to be the physiological limit for pilots, which is more than any of our aircraft can . What can we do now by contrast? Er, none of our aircraft can pull more than seven G, normal aircraft. There's also a close correlation by not just the erm the size of the number for G, but how long can it go on pulling that G given the thrust and the aerodynamic capabilities of the machine and we are essentially building this aircraft so that it can sustain nine G and we are providing the pilot with the sort of equipment he requires to be able to survive in that kind of environment. Is this for a dog fight? Yes, yes. . Th it has er a considerable negative G capability as well. Would it be able, er pulling that erm G to compete with the with the harrier using the technique? Erm Group Captain Granville White. The simple answer is yes. Er so I think the first of my four points is the is the airframe agility, clearly the the ability to m manoeuvre. The second erm is is and perhaps is related in a way er in the air to air weapons where erm in older missiles have had what is known as sort of bore sight capability where they go in the direction of the aircraft. Clearly to have the combination of an off bore sight capability for a a missile such as A S R A A M, the er advance short range air to air missile, the combination of the agility of the weapon and the flat platform together has been shown to be really needed, you can't have one without the other and that somebody who has only agility in the aircraft or agility in the in the weapon, will lose against somebody who has it in both. So I think that's the probably the sort of related point. Moving on into the sort of sensors and the electronics side, erm for survivability erm the defensive aid sub- system will be er very complex, very sophisticated but also integrated so that it has a complete system of protection for the aircraft, erm an and finally moving on on the sort of electronics side then clearly with different sensors such as the radar, the forward looking infra-red, infra-red search and track the er multiple information distribution system and also certain aspects of the er electronic warfare suite then by having sensor fusion which enables the best information at any one time to be correlated into the system as a whole then that will provide a very good capability and far in excess of anything that we have at the moment. Thank you very much. I'll ask Campbell to take us on into the question of the role of this aircraft. We understand that some new weapons, not previously in the specification, are to be included. Are you able to tell us in open session what sort of weapons are envisaged? Erm perhaps I can invite my colleague from the office of management and budgets to speak to that one. Erm chairman yes we hope to to erm, excuse me, to erm that E four will be capable of er sorry E F two thousand will be capable of handling all our erm planned weapons er which are already in our programme the er conventional er, the C A S O M, the conventionally armed, stand-off missile, the er anti- armour missile er twelve thirty eight and the future medium range air-to-air missile er whatever that happens to be er as a result of er competition. What about the low level laser guided bomb, is that also included in this? Yes it is. Erm does the fact of erm using the aircraft to er provide a platform for these systems, er tell us something about a change in view about the role or operating concept of the aircraft? Erm Group Captain Granville White . thank you Erm not not change erm with envisagement . Widen Wi certainly broaden, we've we've envisaged from the outset that the aircraft would be both will be multi- role capable and that erm all that the primary design driver will be the air-to-air air superiority role but the air-to-surface role would be almost an equal, clearly one has to have a a prioritisation and those particular weapons in the air-to-surface side, the conventional armed stand off missile along the low level er low level laser guided bomb and the future anti armour weapon, they clearly erm really take the weaponeering side into the next century. We will still have the ability to carry today's weapons such as the the L seven five five cluster bomb unit, the thousand pound bomb erm and the C R V seven rocket and things like that but clearly as we move forward into the century it's important that as the platform progresses then so does the aircraft. Are the any weapons er which the aircraft er would not be able to , for example the J P two three three closely associated with the tornado, er is that a system which you would anticipate Eurofighter two thousand to be able to carry? No, it it's too large and too heavy and really that is a different role that's more the role for the tornado G L one, G L four. And I think you mentioned thousand pounds bombs. Yes. Is that the, is that the limit could anything heavier than that It's , no it's not the limit er the limit of weight, it can carry er heavier ones. You may not wish to say in open session . I think probably as you . in closed session. Yes, it's probably more appropriate. Erm I was rather interested by the comparisons which you explained a little earlier in the evidence erm if you've got an aircraft which is er going to replace, as I understand it the Jaguar and the Phantom which has already been retired,er against which you've been comparing the F three er and the G R four of the tornados and the harriers, then er that gives rise in my mind to the possibility that this is an aircraft which might replace all of these, in which case will that have consequences for the still er publicly declared intention to order two hundred and fifty, might we order more for example? Mr Evans. Erm as you say Mr Campbell er the plan at the moment is that the F two thousand will replace jaguar and the tornado A D V F three aircraft and the scope er of replacing other aircraft er remains under consideration, er provisional off take of two fifty er was declared at the d the start of the development phase and of course our work share in development is based on that number. Before we seek authorisation for the production phase, it will be necessary for each nation to restate or modify it's planned off take and that will be done very firmly on the basis of the studies which er Group Captain Granville White has already d described which will factor in er against our military tasks, which is,y you know we define now fairly clearly, er exactly what aircraft are needed to undertake those tasks in what scenarios and in the future er as you say, there may well be scope for er adding additional aircraft types to that. Well I think I understand that answer to be an affirmative, that if this aircraft is capable of replacing, if you like, the suite of aircraft we've been discussing, then er that may well result in orders for more than two hundred fifty. It could do because obviously there are a number of other considerations, not least affordability er within the defence programme which erm from my point of view is a very important consideration. But of course if one wants to continue to have the capability into the next century, which the present er range of aircraft provides, er then Eurofighter two thousand may be the only available platform for those purposes. Indeed and I think the er the point about Eurofighter is that it's a very flexible er aircraft, it's a multi-role aircraft, it's a cost effective aircraft and therefore it er, as you say, may well be able to cover quite a large spectrum. Can I ask you about er the medium range surface to air missile because er, you won't be surprised to learn, that er the committee's received a number of submissions on this matter er which suggest that er er t to proceed with Eurofighter two thousand without the medium range surface to air missile er I mean to be put rather bluntly to us, that it makes little sense to proceed with the aircraft without a replacement for blood hound. What's your response to that? Well I think perhaps I can start that and the Group Captain may want to come in. Er I think our position is that we provide as you know, air defence through a layered system er of air defence aircraft and missiles and the simple truth is that in the light of the changes in the strategic er setting, particularly er as it affects U K air defence, we have decided that the provision of a medium defensive layer, that is the M sound system to which you refer, is not a high priority at the moment and the programme is therefore being postponed and I have to emphasise it's not been abandoned. Well erm if I were then to ask you when what was your best estimate to when the programme was likely to be commenced. I fancy you would not be able to give me any more precise an answer than one you've just given, isn't that right? Well programmers tend not to be precise in this, in this kind of er context er Mr Campbell. But certainly we er as I said, the essential point is that we are looking, looking at the capability across the board and taking into account the strategic requirement as we see it in terms of the direct threat to the U K in particular, which is obviously dramatically declined as a result of the collapse of the Warsaw pact. We believe that certainly for the time being, the combination of the fighter aircraft and rapier will provide an acceptable level er of air defence with a much reduced air threat to the U K er which now exists. We will continue to look at er the future programme er we will also as you know, look at ballistic missile defence which is another element to this and that must need to be fact facted in as well but I think clearly we are not talking about in the medium term er and longer term, we are talking about er a fairly late stage of the programme. I mean how do you protect Eurofighter two thousand in the absence of the medium range surface to air missile on the, I think you you told us about er the aircraft themselves as it were providing their own protection but what else? Well as I've said we we have as you say y y yourself, you have the aircraft itself, you have the er the existing er air defence aircraft, you have rapier and in in our view, er in certainly in terms of the U K's threat er that is er an acceptable er er suite of preventative measures in the light of the threat which we now have. I think I have to make the point to you that we are planning to roughly double the size of the er airforce equipment programme er between now and the end of the century, a very substantial chunk of that is E F two thousand and its er associated weapon systems and, you know, one has to frankly, take er a view on priorities er in the light of the strategic requirement and given the er extent of the threat as we see it, the possibility of using er of taking part in out of area operations in coalitions, that kind of thing, that was the judgement we took er the medium term priorities were such that we couldn't afford the first er stage of A M S A M. W was that decision to any extent er influenced by, if I can put it rather er ineptly, the state of blood hound when it was taken out of service. Well as you know I think the committee looked at this erm in nineteen ninety one and er I think it is fairly true to say that by the time it was taken out of service blood hound did not represent a very high level of capability erm and the gap, there is a gap obviously between blood hound it'll it'll now be a rather longer gap between that and any A M S A M replacement, er but blood hound itself was judged to be frankly not worth having. I remember Mr Alan Clarke who was then minister of responsibility saying rather elliptically in the house of commons that the removal of blood hound did nothing to degrade Britain's air defence. I would not wish to disagree with Mr Clarke. Well I wouldn't offer that as a general er proposition. Neither would I actually, in this particular case . perhaps we should confine it to the specifics we're talking. One last matter please erm, so far as I understand that you've not yet drafted the separate staff requirement for reconnaissance, I beg you pardon, reconnaissance equipment for Eurofighter two thousand. Are you able to tell us what the timescale of that is? Perhaps I can ask Group Captain? Yes. of the four nations in the programme, the U K is the only one that has a requirement for reconnaissance. Erm, and at the moment we are carrying out some studies which er are nearing completion, to decided exactly what the R A F's future requirements are for tactical reconnaissance. As that work comes to er fruition, the staff target will be drafted and in fact work is already begun on that, erm but because the reconnaissance capability won't be required until fairly late in the replacement programme then there is no particular hurry to get on with the work. What we hope to be able to do is to complete the requirement the staff target this year and set in train some industrial studies to see what the various options are and then once we enter the production investment phase then that would be the time that we would er look to doing the development work. Are these costs included in the overall estimates which have been given to us f for the reconnaissance. reconnaissance. Er, yes indeed they are. They are many thanks, thank you. Neville Trotter. from what you've told us, it would be possible for this aircraft to be so multi mission it could replace the whole of the front line er R A F fast jet strain, could that be true? Group Captain. I I think the the the point I would I wish to make is that in whilst er its multi role capability would have enabled it to replace a number of roles and possibly a number of er aircraft and er as Mr Evans said earlier, that's still being looked at. The one role that it won't be able to carry out is, as we were talking earlier, about the er J P two three three, runway denial weapon and also er nuclear. So that that,those two roles er clearly cannot be covered by it. I I was also thinking o of Veestol and and er the weapons going on and the mistakes anyway on on the developing a harrier replacement, is the R A F still interested in that as a feature a short take-off vertical take-off? I think the R A F would would clearly be interested in in keeping in touch with what's going on there, of course the states themselves er the picture is not entirely clear er about er what kind of types are going to emerge in the longer term but we would certainly wish to keep a a close view on what was going on and of course there is a Navy dimension to to the harrier replacement as well. Coming back to what you said about the load carrier, we are supposed to no longer be in the nuclear game in the airforce, isn't that right coming out of the nuclear role? So that would no longer be a consideration. I think I think erm it's a question, Mr Trotter, it's the long range penetrator I think which erm is is the distinction, it's the ability to get through low level, longer range and carrying greater level of ordnance than either . Wh what about er runway lengths, obviously depends on what it's carrying but er how how does it compare with existing aircraft for that? Erm, it's very much shorter because as we were saying earlier on the the short take off and landing capability, erm with er I'd prefer to talk about distances perhaps in the closed session but the er the simple answer is very much . Only one crew member with all the technology in the world, some of us still think that it's a comfort to have somebody in the back watching the systems. Well that particular subject of course is er er still a matter which is discussed with great heat er in the crew rooms all over the Royal Air Force. Especially the navigators. Exactly and er we are buying er a two seat version of this aeroplane er our two seat version is aimed primarily at operational training but er we have examined er time and again whether we believe the er the integration of the avionics which is possible in this aeroplane and which is planned for this aeroplane er is going to be able to reduce the pilot work load to such an extent that one man can comfortably do the job and we have arrived at the conclusion that he most certainly can. The er work which has preceded at er British Aerospace in the the cockpit, to bring together all the information, displays and controls erm has been tested on er a team of eighteen pilots from, drawn from the four nations, to see whether they believe they can cope with that sort of pilot work load in in simulated operations and they're content that this kind of cockpit is ideally suited for the task and they can cope. So we are convinced that it is er a cheap one. What about spare aircraft. Do you set out the sum, er you must set out some calculation of how many you are likely to to lose over the life of the aircraft, is there a percentage figure you could give us for that? Erm, Mr Evans er will reply to that, obviously we we do plan for certain levels. Yes I think it's fair to say at the moment that, that, that is being looked at Mr Trotter, together with er the broader range of issues on the er the operating concept er for E F two thousand but it is of course standard practice to buy not just the number you need for the front line but to buy sufficient aircraft to keep that front line in field for about twenty five, thirty years, whatever the life of the aircraft happens to be, taking account of er attrition, taking account of training requirements and engineering needs and support needs and all that kind of thing and all that work er is, has been done, is being done at the moment and er final figures will be put to that in in due course. Thank you, Mr Colgan. Mr erm bearing in mind it its multi role capability and the fact that the U K is likely to be engaged in more and more out of air operations in support of U N er has any consideration been given to a maritime variant. Would that be er a practical thing to do or would you have to start redesigning a new aircraft? Er by maritime variant do you . I mean from air, to fly from aircraft carriers. The short answer is no. Not at this stage. Is that because of technical difficulties, or for some other reason. Erm er it's basically that there is no stated requirement at present from any of the four nations, for this aircraft to operate on ships er back in the early days of the programme when the the French were involved er we looked at the possibility of designing an aircraft er to provide the whole spectrum of capabilities from air defence er ground attack and also maritime operations off ships and er we we certainly experienced some difficulties in reconciling all those things in one design, which was adequately capable in each of the areas. Thank you Campbell. There's an ambiguity I suspect it it's a in my mind rather than yours about the nuclear role, did I understand you to say that Eurofighter two thousand would not have the capability of carrying for instance the W E one seven seven, we know that the is not going to be er taken any further according to recent announcement but will Eurofighter two thousand have the capacity to carry W E one seven seven? No that demonstrated the point I was making, it will not. So it, in the absence of the Tasm and in the absence of the capability then it's not gonna have a nuclear role. No. Thank you very much. Winston Churchill. Would there not be merits er at least putting in the requisite wiring in case at a future date, that a C A S O M for instance, became dual capable? Er, perhaps I could make er one comment, maybe Mr Gordon will ma wish to make a a technical comment on it, but certainly when we began the programme and we discussed with the other nations in the early stages of of the collaboration. erm It was really one of the guidelines, it was the, if we considered doing that then I don't think we would have had a four nation programme or certainly a five nation programme at the start, I don't think we would've er stayed together, it was really one of the basic requirements not to have that capability. But is it not an add on capability er to a large degree if the basic wiring is there? I think we'd find Mr Churchill that it it's rather more complex than that and and the requirements for delivering a nuclear weapon and you refer to the possibility of C A S O M being nuclear capable, one has to be fairly careful quite a, there's a degree of difference between a missile needed to do the two jobs and I think it would be rather more than wiring which would be er at issue here, there's the payload and all the rest of it which I suspect would cause very severe problems with that. Er well we always start from what does the operator of this aircraft want to use it for. This E S R D really is the bible and we have specified the aircraft to meet that E S R D and not anything extra, er obviously if one of the four nations wants to build a nuclear role into the aircraft that becomes a very big political question first and foremost and we have just not considered it at the technical level at all because it's er it's not in the requirement. Is it a big technical problem or is it very straight forward. Er I don't think I'd wish to speculate in in open forum. It doesn't require a great bite of imagination to see that the Germans for example would have been extremely reluctant to have been involved in a four nation project with a nuclear capability available as part of it. Well I I I wouldn't er pin point the German attitude on this one, I mean after all we did collaborate with Germany very successfully on the tornado which has a nuclear role but the the four governments must first of all decide if that is what we want to build into this aeroplane and they decided that they did not at that stage. I stand corrected. Fine. If I just er end this this particular item in two brief questions. From what you said about reconnaissance equipment it rather sounds to me as if the tornado D R one A is likely to be replaced by in this reconnaissance role. Is that right? I think as a Group Captain er explained y'know the the operational staff have really got to complete their study into what kind of tactical reconnaissance capability they want in the next century. The D R one A is currently an excellent er tactical reconnaissance aircraft, all weather, at night etcetera and er it will go on well into the next century so there's no great hurry to to make a decision er one of the first points has gotta be decided is whether we carry the reconnaissance equipment in a pod under the aircraft replacing some of the other weapons or whether we try to build it in and er but taking first things first we have to get the requirement sorted out. Thank you and as far as the jaguar's concerned I noted that the jaguar is not being phased out now until two thousand and four, that being a three year further delay. Is that related to the delay in production dates? Erm, Mr Evans. Er no I don't think it is Mr Chairman. And do we know what the reasoning behind it is . Well we do or we'd, it had already been envisaged that er the jaguars would run out at er roughly that time. I think it was three years earlier though wasn't it? Well er the I mean there has been a slight complexity with the replacement er programme of course because er er E F two thousand was originally envisaged that it would replace the phantoms er as as as as well as the jaguars and now that er has altered with the decision in options to er get rid of er the phantom squadrons, we've er been able to adjust the replacement programme such that er the aircraft E F two thousand will replace er the erm er the jaguar and some of the F threes er and the programme will be adjusted such that we get er the most cost effective er mixture of replacement of those two types and there is no problem with keeping the jaguar going until that stage and it may well be it is, is being judged to be cheaper that we should er do some F three replacement at the same time, again partly for cost reasons because it's gonna be more cost effective to do it that way. like the jaguar really be able to go on that long given er that er there's an awful lot of errors in the Gulf apart from anything else. Well obviously that factor er was considered carefully by the Ministry of Defence before our Secretary of State agreed that we could safely defer the in service date for Eurofighter two thousand and adjust the the er replacement plan er back in December ninety two, so we have looked at what is the current rate of consumption of airframe life on the jaguar er what can be done economically and sensibly to keep it flying safely and effectively into the next century and er we have come to the conclusion that we have a viable plan here which can tie up with the planned rate of delivery to service of Eurofighter two thousand. So are you gonna have to restrict training in er operational flights jaguar at a stretch just to stretch out the hours? We understand that that is not necessary but erm my colleague may wish to. No . But it does sound from what you're telling us now that it is actually directly related and to recall my original question, was it related to programme to which I had the answer no, erm what you said . Well I I apologise we're not trying to mislead you er Mr Chairman in any way. Clearly there is a connection, if Eurofighter two thousand was available earlier then they the plan for replacing er some of the aircraft in the R A F's front line er could be adjusted accordingly erm but it's not a sort of direct one for one er if the part of the programme slips a year the jaguar must go on an extra year because within the R A F's overall plans for its er fleet replacement there is a certain degree of flexibility an and precisely which point the jaguars get replaced is er a judgement between them and their three. I think I know what you mean anyway, thank you. Neville Trotter Two er requirements for the future that er seem to be er er desirable are stealth and what could be stealthier than the present generation of aircraft and secondly to prevent you having to go over your target you're likely to be shot down so that you need a stand up weapon capability, er if the payload is somewhat limited can it still carry stand off weapons that are effective? Er, Group Captain. those yes, yes. Erm perhaps I could would it, I wonder if you could just expand on stealth exactly what the er Have actually already covered them another time and I don't want to get deeper in the stealth now than that, there's a limit on the time now available this morning. Can we deal with the weapon question, the stand off weapons. I can answer that very briefly Mr Chairman er yes, there will be the capability to carry stand off weapons the conventionally armed stand off missile for example will have a good stand off range. That will be carried by . That will be carried and er with a shorter range but the advanced anti armour weapon, that will also have a stand off capability and that will also be carried. go on into the development timescale and costs. Yes it's now going to take two years longer I think than was originally er contended, to what extent is this due to technical difficulties and to what extent is it due to one of our partners and Germany one's thinking of in particular, wishing to slow the programme down for fiscal reasons? Well erm it's a combination of both those factors er as I've mentioned at the outset the development programme has moved ahead a little more slowly than we would wish, the main reasons for this were associated firstly with the delay in selecting equipment er and that took longer than our contractor ha had imagined. Secondly the deliveries of the equipment from the equipment suppliers who had been selected er generally fell behind the promises which they had made, so the main reason for the technical delays has been lack of equipment of the correct standard to proceed with the integration programme erm the erm the problems which beset the programme in nineteen ninety two after the German minister started questioning its future clearly had a direct bearing on that because many of the equipment suppliers, particularly those in Germany, suddenly began to think hey this programme is not going anywhere, why should we invest a lot of effort and and money into it and they slowed down so that has had a knock on effect in in terms of delaying the total programme and erm the result of all of that has been that the current development programme schedule which we have supplied to the committee is probably about as fast as the programme is capable of running. First flight still going to be in April? We are confident it will be in April, yes. And will that aircraft be less capable in its first flight than you'd originally hoped? Erm it has always been planned that the this er release of the flight control system, will be phased through five steps and the capabilities at first flight are more or less what we had been planning er right from the outset. The cost is going to be some three thousand four hundred million I think to er to the U K. That's er gone up by about thirteen percent, four hundred million roughly, er over the original estimates, half of that is due to programme re-orientation because of the extension of the programme by two years as I understand it. Can you spell out what those costs are and are we having to pay more because Germany wants to slow the programme down? Perhaps I can ask Mr Perry to er fill in the details on costs? Yes. Erm Mr Trotter er that er apportionment of the four hundred and fifty million between er the effect of programme re-orientation and other factors. Can I just say that I had figured four hundred million, it is in fact four fifty. Four fifty million sorry. Four fifty million, erm between programme re-orientation and other factors was an apportionment we made back in the er first half of nineteen ninety three and in the light of later information I think we would revise that now erm we are still negotiating with the contractors on the revised contract price and we do not have definitive costs yet but in fact the cost increase as a result of the rescheduling of the programme directly should be quite modest. There are some unavoidable costs er on that count, particularly on the engine programme where delays to the aircraft programme which results in extra costs on the engine side are the customer's liability. Erm, but the main increase in cost is actually in the equipment area and results I think from the fact that the equipment prices turned out to be higher than was originally estimated at the start of the programme and also the fact that U K industry won a higher work share on equipment than we had originally been entitled to and budgeted for and lastly the point you mentioned that Germany has withdrawn from some parts of the requirement and that made certain equipments non common and we have had to take a larger share of the cost of those equipments than originally planned. Okay, can you spell out how our share of the cost has increased because our share of the work has increase. I thought that presumably the bill was still divided proportionately between the countries. No the, the bills are met by er on the territorial funding basis so basically we pay for the work done in the U K. From which we will get the benefit presumably when production starts. In in in in er general terms, whether the production work sharing is. It is carried. those in favour. Aye. Those against. No. The ayes have it. Item six to report social services committee Mr Then you turn your attention away in a minute and the rotten devils do Chairman, I I move that the report of the social services committee regarding the future of the county council's old persons homes be noted. I hope Chairman that er David will listen to the arguments on this because like other members of his group he throws out closure of elderly persons homes, y'know we've gotta do it, we've gotta do it something about which he knows absolutely nothing and about which he's completely wrong. erm I've always believed that consistency is an overrated virtue so I'm not gonna criticise the Conservatives for changing their minds but you have to ask yourself why is this recorded on the agenda today when the sub-committee, planning sub- committee has already met and discussed these matters and things have moved on a little further Well we we really have to look at how the resolution in this paragraph came about in the first place. erm At the beginning of the social services committee meeting Mr moved a resolution which he previously moved at the social services planning sub-committee which listed most of the things which are presently in the the resolution but it started the social services accept the implication of the director of social services report on the future of the department's elderly person's homes erm, after some minutes of debate the er Democrats asked if the Tories would remove that phrase from the resolution and then tha the Democrats, the Liberal Democrats would vote for it the Tories of course er looking gift horses in the mouth as usual, said no and the the that resolution was lost. We then voted on a lengthy Liberal resolution er, it was amended by Labour we voted on all of the separate points in the resolution, all were agreed and then Professor decided that he wanted to move a further amendment which after some consultation, some discussion with the legal people about it's validity, he did which wiped out all of the things that we'd just agreed and we turned to the original Conservative motion minus the beginning phrase and with a couple of things stuck on at the end and we thought well that's it the Conservatives will vote for that, but no although it was their own motion in all but name, the Conservatives wouldn't vote for that unless Mr was allowed to move it. So he did. So he did and it was voted on and it was agreed. We spent Chairman, two and a half hours discussing this matter at that point and we had come full circle back to point 1. To get back to that beginning phrase the social services committee accepts the implications of the director of social services report on the future of the departments E P H's. That report predicted a rise from five hundred to nine hundred er in the vacancies in in homes by nineteen ninety six. Since then at the planning sub-committee Mr has produced a whole load of new made-up figures which pretend that the situation is far worse than that. Figures designed to get headlines not make headway. The figures actually which I got from the director yesterday are that the department is counting four hundred and ten vacancies of those four hundred and ten, two hundred and thirty four are out of commission, they're in homes being refurbished seventy two are in blocked places, that is double rooms being lived in by a widow or widower where er they'd previously shared it with the spouse or er disability reasons, health reasons, behaviour reasons of a resident er in a previously shared room. Purposes like that er which take out seventy two places. In fact as of the first of this month, the number of real vacancies was a hundred and four now today I've received another list of er so called vacancies from the Leicestershire South area. As of the thirteenth of the ninth ninety three I'll just read through one or two of these. Curtis Weston, no vacancies, one short stay vacancy. Demontfort, no vacancies. Endaby, two double rooms being used at single occupancy for Lental House residents, one shared female bed available. So on and so on in Leicestershire South ten vacancies, seven short stay vacancies. So you can see Chairman the facts and figures simply do not support either the report which came to the social services committee originally or Mr inflated figures. The true vacancies are a hundred and four across thirty eight homes, we're talking about two or three real vacancies per home. So Mr talked in the debate about internal reorganisation about continuing to provide services for which there is an over provision and it berated me and the Labour group for that. Well the figures show that assessments of the over provision are incorrect but even had they been correct if circumstances were an over provision comes about not because of an increase in our provision of services, but because of expansion in the private sector. Are we supposed simply to abdicate our responsibility and for every new place that's started in the private sector, we close down a place in our er organisation. Is that what this is about, that places can continue to spring up in the private sector and we must close our homes in order to meet that demand not from elderly people for places but from the private sector for profits. Placements, April to August a hundred and fifty nine in nursing homes, two hundred and eight in residential homes in all sectors. But, we know that April was a low figure, we also know that July and August are low a figure which comes out from this graph and was given to me by the director yesterday, is a genuine average which is turning out to be between a hundred and a hundred and ten placements per month twelve hundred to fourteen hundred placements per year a thr over a three year average residency period three thousand six hundred to four thousand two hundred placements in residential care, where then is the real problem. The problem is with the fact that seventy five to eighty percent of people are being directed towards the private sector and only twenty to twenty five percent towards the public sector, yet still the private sectors squeal. I've got here a copy of a letter by Peter spokesperson for care, a more misnamed organisation you couldn't wish to come across, a combined association of residential establishments. A letter to G P s. Dear doctor,we have noticed that as a result of a press article, copy enclosed, that there's been concern stressed by a number of general practitioners with regards the slowness of the social services controlled community care programme as an association on behalf of our residential and nursing home members we have been stating the same fact to social services who have basically denied the existence of any problem, although we hope that in the long term the social services will be able refine their system to be more efficient, as an interim measure we are offering you a direct line service. If you wish to effect a placement in a residential or nursing home we hope for the time being it will help resolve your problem. This is an attempt to circumvent the assessment process. They cannot of course do that, this letter described by the director of social services as a disgrace. No, people sitting across in the other benches saying of course they can are wrong. Of course they can't. People may put themselves into residential care if they wish they will pay the whole of the bill. If they wish to be assessed as needing residential care and using public money then they have to go through the assessment process and be assessed as needing residential care. So this letter which refers to our processes in this county council, it's talking about people who want to go into residential care and to use public money. All of that being said and Mr will talk a bit more about the figures when he comes to speak. People will no doubt be relieved to hear what has finally been included in the planning sub-committee resolutions. That homes already furbished or in the process of being refurbished or identified for refurbishment shall not be closed and will re-open as county council E P H s. That reassurance is essential to residents, staff and to the community. That's what they desperately want to hear. We have also decided that we will look again at the costs of refurbishment. That we will seek to refurbish the homes which will cost least to refurbish, first. That way we will achieve more in the period and for the money that is available. That will leave us, presumably at the end of this process with some of the worst homes, which we will then have to decide what to do about. So although the Labour group will be moving a reference back of this matter as an amendment. I have to say that our input into what is going on is still very strong. We are still attempting to persuade people that the figures they have been given or have invented are wrong and if we operate on the real figures there is no reason for mass closures of elderly persons homes and we are still attempting to make the refurbishment programme work as best we can to achieve the most we can in the shortest period and for the least money. Chairman I move formally. Seconder. Sec Right we have an amendment to be moved by Mr . I thought you would Chairman, take it later I see a lot of hands up on the other side. erm The reason why we moved the amendment on this is er Jim been and that has, we started to query the figures I didn't get involved in the all this week and th people like Jim , David loads of my attention and the whole er exercise was a fraud they're all bum figures and when I checked, the figures I have checked here are done by a senior officer when I showed 'im what stuff was being wrong. apartments and I couldn't believe how they they there there could work up such a system and I'm serious, I I really mean this Mr Chairman, it is serious. Now what you were doing was, you got the top figure of available beds and you this time, I'm only going for the this paper that is shown to me a an an an and produced some place in in your apartments and it says here, partly vacancies weekend in the first of August. I was surprised when I found out who the officer, a very capable officers what's done the figures. But then I was reminded how I thought of a an accountant who was at work what figure was five and five and he said what figures did you have in mind. So what has happened here I believe, that there was someone told, I don't know who it was was told this is the figure, now you you you're . I will say that because as, we haven't heard the end by a long way for, of this one. Jim pointed out that and when I looked at, in the report here, page fifteen, two of your paper and there it says in little letters B, little little two appendix B a during the year, a three year period from June ninety three to October ninety six, the level of occupancy the department's afford. Vacancies who arise from five seventeen,had a figure of five seventeen, when I looked at this now, how could y , where did they get the figures from this . Didn't that someone to do the the the homework for them. So you did, right at the top one as I said two thousand four three four and then the closure of Coulson House in it. Well I hope there's nobody in Coulson House because it's boarded up and I cannot see how you get a vacant bed in Coulson House and this is this exercise. So we take that away and then you got the refurbishment programme and now taken away from the refurbishment programme something like two hundred, now where is the if you're refurbishing four homes where is the vacancies when you close the home, you have made the staff the redundant, they go up the road or out wherever they're going to redundancy persons. You have made 'em red, you have made 'em redundant and you in, in you have and I the engines er and er I that's about all er. What sort of runway was it? There were, there was, there wasn't any runway it was just a grass airfield as there was a lot of them in those days erm this, this is why they, they couldn't get any aircraft of any size in there you see, this is why some of them used to overshoot if they got twin engines before the war erm About how many people were employed there would you say at this time? Oh hundreds I would think, all of three hundred people. Were men and women involved in this ? Oh yes oh yes working on the aircraft as well. Mm was that all they actually did during those war years there just repairing the aircraft That's right yes yes cos and putting them back into service? motorcycle side-cars were very much a luxury trade you see. It was totally devoted to war work. Erm they er as airfields had to be protected they build some pillboxes, country pillboxes for the Home Guard at strategic points I was going to ask you about security and also the Home Guard or the army were in the house at the far side of the airport which was called Aldridge Lodge they were very much in there the erm Where there ever any breaches of security? Oh no no, it was really a happy-go-lucky time you, you had to be alive in those days to appreciate it, it, people sort of got together and it, it's a different attitude to life today er much more friendly people there and they, we all worked together we all pulled together to defeat Hitler this, this was the thing in those days. Were women involved in the work there as well? Yes, yes, yes and What sort of things would they have done? Well they, they were er helping the electricians and er but they were er they weren't so technically involved as perhaps they would be today. They were very much sort of in an assistance capi capacity if you can understand. Erm how types of craftsmen were employed there to do things? Well there were electricians there were carpenters, the carpenters were into directly involved with building aircraft but they used to create the engines and make engine stands such things and do maintenance work around. There were engine fitters, electricians, riggers and er course there were sheet metal workers as well working in aluminium and pop rivets er there was er also a government inspection department and a works inspection department and er things and da the Air Ministry had to be very up to scratch you know erm Did they work through the night as well, was it shiftwork there? Not as I remember no funnily enough but they used to have people who, who went out to work at different airports after the planes had gone out they used to have gangs that went out to Perton and er we used to draw equipment from er the maintenance un RAF maintenance unit at Stafford things used to come from there. What did these gangs go out to Perton for, what was that all about? Well after the, the aircraft had actually er left the airport to go, be handed back to the RAF they said sometimes had to be serviced or final adjustments made and that's what they used to go out there for but erm Helliwells was ver it was still, all through the war it was Helliwells aircraft they used to have their own lorries and everything and they used to erm, be under the auspices of the Air Ministry but it was very much a private company. You mention test flights er Yes yes was there just one test pilot or Yeah well there was one main test pilot that's right and other people like, who used to be an instrument gang as well, well I do know this fella Cyril he was a dental mechanic in Walsall before the war and he came in there and he was an instrument mechanic and he used, he used to go up with the test pilot to actually test the instruments in the other compartments in the plane or cockpits just to see how they were reacting under operational conditions. He subsequently er went to work at the Berlick in latter years and, and this man was just sweeping-up at the Berlick and I couldn't believe it cos he was so high up in the technology in the war and he'd be a dental mechanic and he'd come down to just being a sweeper-up, and he used to show me the pay packets he'd got in the war and you know it was fantastic money even, even by today's standards this is going back fifteen years What did he used to earn and how did it compare with ? Well he showed me packets thirty five and forty pounds a week which then those days was utterly fantastic money. And what would an ordinary person have been earning at Helliwells? Well in the war five pounds a week was extraordinary money, cos they used to say a fella had got a good job if he was getting five pounds a week in those days, so that when I started work first I, I was getting fifteen shillings a week, so you can understand that seventy five pence today, at fourteen. I went to the Bluecoat School in Walsall and they erm they used to run a A T C wing in there which later to belonged to and they they brought this Hawker Demon in, which was a plane into the playground for the instruction of the A T C fellas and the kids all ripped the canvas off it for souvenirs and it was down to a skeleton in no time You mentioned that you used to have to go to Helliwells down at Beskett Beskett yeah yeah erm what was the set-up there? They, they used to build wings for the, they had er all pop riveters and they used to b build wings for the planes that finally came up to the airport down there and erm it was very much a structural set-up as I say I used to have to take plates down there from the airport to be normalized, it was er a sort of softening treatment for aluminium and made them easier to shape and rivet them onto the main fuselage, but they, they used to make Harvard wings and cowls, engine cowls, for the Bostons and Havocs they weren't the one type of Boston was a fighter bomber and another one it had the front navigator's position cut out and they used to have a search light put in there which they used to call Turbin lights and they were for use of coastal command of the RAF first searchlighting for submarines, looking for submarines, the er the Harvards were very much trained as some of them came in from the Navy they were used for training landing of pilots on aircraft carriers, and they had hooks underneath you know the er they were a very good trainer they were still used today, but when we used to go and see films at the pictures they used to use them a lot as Japanese aircraft because they looked alike, and they used to use them as zeros in the American films these Harvard trainers, er and but like as I said they had a experimental department at Helliwells and they used to try out various things to see if they could improve on the structure or the instrumentation things like that Were there any parts of er of the complex that were out of bounds sort of top secret work going on or anything like that? Well no not really because erm it, it was a private company as you can understand er, I can I can't really explain it everyone seemed to be pulling together you know that was the last thing you thought of, fifth columnists, things like that although it was they used to er, every now and again they used to send government national service officers round to look at the personnel and the structure of the working and if they thought anybody was superfluous to requirements they'd get the papers soon after to go into the army or the services yeah, yeah, that is true and that happened, used to happen in factories all round the area, it was called the Essential Works Order. Was there erm a canteen there or facilities for you? Yes, yes that's where they used to have the shows in the lunchtime they had very good er food arrangements and facilities. We used to go up there for our breaks as well morning and afternoon and they used to have dances sometimes in the evening. What was the food like? Cos it was sort of rationing at that time. That's right yes oh we used to get sausages with bread in it and potatoes mainly you know, greens and things like that were the staple diet but they, they used to get rations apart from people's personal rations being on war work if you can understand. So you were well looked after. Oh yes yes very much so. You mentioned er you had a friend that worked at the, the bomb dump at Lindley. That's right Can you tell me anything about that? It, well nothing really in depth but there was erm something else I was going to tell you. As I had to go to Beskett this young woman had not long been married and she always used to ask me to call at her house in Palfrey, cos I used to go on a bike not in a van, on a carrier bike, she used to ask me to call at her house in Palfrey to see if there were any mail from her husband and he was, there sometimes was sometimes there wasn't nothing you know that he'd written and er one day I'd got back and er she was all in tears and er he, he had been killed in France and I was glad I didn't have to be the harbinger of the times you know she still lives in Palfrey now Mrs yeah. This, this bomb dump it was a RAF place was it? Yes, yes, yeah, but they did have civilians working there but I don't know where they used to ferry the bombs out to but I do believe they used to carry detonators and everything down there you know. They were just stored in the caverns That's right yeah, yeah, yeah but er cos I remember the caverns from before the war when I was in the Cubs. I was in the central Cubs and we used to go up there to lime pits and round Lingley Woods you know on days out tracking and all that sort of thing. Did you ever go down the caverns? No, no I've never been down and er they've always been full of water whenever I've been up around there. Did they have problems with keeping the water out during the time they were storing the Well as I understand they must have had pumps down there or something to or something to keep them dry because er Were you in any sort of A R P unit or anything like that during the war years? Er I, I was a messenger for a time for the er, we lived in Lane and I was a messenger for a time with the erm A R P headquarters in Drive, now when my uncle got married and he had two children and I'd, they were issuing gas masks and I had to go down and fetch a gas mask for his daughter and they were great big ones that used to envelope the whole babies with a bellows on the side that the mothers used to have to pump when they were in them, thank goodness we never had to use them and erm What sort of a set-up was it in Lane the A R P? Oh Drive Drive, sorry. Well it was a large double-fronted house and it was sand-bagged all round and there were tables and to er, administer, you know, wardens in the unevent of air raids which they used to do and they used to patrol the streets looking for lights to see if pe my nan actually got fined once cos she, she event inadvertently went into a room and put the light on and forgot she'd left the curtains open and an air raid warden happened to be around she, she got hauled into court and fined five pounds for that, er she er I, I once I was just thinking the other day just telling a friend of mine, they had an actual practice air raid once and in some old buildings in the Burchells and we as kids had to go and lie in there and wait till we'd got a tag on and what would happen to us a label and they took us to the first aid post in, an ambulance came and picked us up on a stretcher and took us to the first aid post in Road. We used to have dress rehearsal, some, I think I got mustard gas burns as well I was supposed to have on my arm er Did this er, going back to Helliwells again, repairing of the aircraft, did that cease when the war finished or did it continue for a time afterwards? It, it, it just went on for a lit a short time afterwards but er, but when the war ended course things, some things changed pretty rapidly as you can appreciate but, but by this time I, I was working for Ellwells then on long distance transport and we used to have to go and fetch tractors or bulldozers that had got armour plating on from Dagenham docks and bring them up here and start selling them to civic contractors and the, the Americans were selling a lot of equipment as well at end of the war, and I saw money made overnight like, people were buying the lorries and putting them on the road you know for work and transport firms and all that and they were getting some of them for next to nothing So Helliwells were involved in this? Not really no, I was working for another firm by this time. We, I used to move around a lot on those days as you could do really speaking because I wasn't old enough to be under the Essential Works Order you see, and er I was by the time I went into the army it was 1946 so er the war was over. Yeah tell me the sequence of your jobs then, you started off you were a messenger at Helliwells and then what did you do? Helliwells yeah Yes then what did you do after that? Well I went to, erm they wouldn't let me go to work on the aircraft so I left and I went to work and the Walsall Electric Company, it was within Walsall and I was there when V E day happened and er a pal of mine said he knew where I could get this job and oh it was travelling about which I enjoyed and er I, I went then to work for Elwells I was there until I went in the army, but they were very much heavy transport and in those days the opencast mining started happening as well and we were taking diggers about bulldozers and tractors, scrapers for the opencast mining and I remember, in the bad winter of forty-seven, they, they took up a big part of Park, trees and everything and they never found a bit of coal and yet when started levelling off at Darleston, for Bentley Garden Village as it was then called, er they were getting coal out and people were going up with prams, barrows and everything and fetching it all out it was only being levelled for building work, and fetching coal, natural coal off Bentley Common the erm I've wandering off away from the airport a bit haven't I? Tell me about V E day. Yes, I was working at Walsall airport er Walsall electrics, sorry, at the time and er I've been out to the pictures I, with a couple of friends and er I got home this particular evening and I put the late night dance music on on the radio and they, they interrupted the programme to tell us that er Germany had accepted unconditional surrender and the war was over. Well, my gran had told me that she'd gone down to see her friends who'd get the Brown Lion after them by this time and er I decided to go down and tell them as I could see if they hadn't got the radio on they wouldn't have known so as I walked from Burchells down Road I could see doors throwing open lights were coming on, people were coming out in the street and dancing and I got round down to the Brown Lion and it was all in darkness, and I rang the bell on the side door and I heard a few bumps and bangs and Mr who'd kept it then came to the door, and I said do you know the war's over and er he said oh no come on in that's w now his son was a prisoner of war and they had been, he'd continually tried to escape so much that he had his photograph taken in the Sunday paper, the, the Germans had had kept chaining him to the wall and other prisoners, other soldiers had got these photographs of him and smuggled them out and got them back to England, to the nearest papers, and er he he'd said to my nan cos he knew she'd always worked behind the bar, he said will you serve if I open the pub now, which was about eleven o'clock at night and she said yes of course, and the they opened the Brown Lion at about eleven o'clock at night in next to no time the place was full of people drinking, celebrating and of course the next day was really it. I remember going down to the bridge in Walsall and a sailor climbed the old clock and tied his collar around it and a soldier got up and put his hat on and an airman got up and put his tie with a red, white and blue rosette on it, around the arms of the old clock and people were loving and kissing everywhere, and oh it was really you had to be alive to appreciate it. After, after the years of hardship and loss and then ev everything came as a relief, course we were still at war with the Japanese and people were still in Burma, our soldiers were still in Burma fighting the Japanese, but having said that the main issue was over and it wasn't long after the Americans dropped the atomic bomb and of course, I always thought they had to really or else the Japanese would still be fighting now the er they had special dances in the Town Hall for the V E Day and the Americans who did a a jitterbug contest and er I always remember my friend and his sister, who was English, they actually won it against the Yanks he er Did the Americans have a lot to do with Walsall ? Oh yes, yes, they even had like they used to have savings' weeks er salute the soldier week, they used to have promotions for National Savings you see and we used to get so much money or where they had a bid thermometer on the car park in Street which is now the extension of the Gala Baths and they used to show how much savings had been put in they used to have targets for people, to put the National Savings in, they used to have an Anglo-American friendship week. What was that exactly? Well they used to ask you to invite the e actually invite the American soldiers into your homes and my friend in Chuckery a couple of years ago, I was visiting him one Sunday lunch and a knock came to his door and he went and it was a guy who came over to see, his mum is now dead, but he, he come over he remembered him from the war. He was stationed in an old chapel in Chuckery because the Americans once they'd started they were putting them everywhere or anywhere they could just get to be with them before V Day they were even in little chapels, churches, outhouses anywhere they could possibly and there were guns and bits of trucks on every spot of land where they could get them the er, I'm getting out of context I was just thinking about a tank, a First World War tank that they used to have those as well in the field gun in the er arboretum which were disappeared soon after the war they went for scrap and they came and they used, people used to have a lot of wrought iron railings as well they took those as well they came along with burners and went off to the war effort, but er like I say the Americans and of course as kids they were very generous with kids and we absolutely loved them. They used to give us gum and sweets everything and the, they sometimes, the military police they used to come down town and they'd be after deserters from Lichfield and Is that where the Americans were stationed? That's right the tenth replacement depot in Lichfield and they used to come round to Walsall looking for absentees and deserters and they there was actually a shooting match in Street the MPs started firing the guns at these fellas who'd gone absent without leave, and, but as I understand I remember at the time there was a lot of racism in America then and they, they picked these coloured fellas up and apparently the C O at Lichfield was very much a southern colonel and he was a racist and they used to chain these coloured guys up behind the trucks and make them walk all the way back to Lichfield behind the trucks driving the trucks at walking pace and I understand there was a, a salver, a commemorative salver in the Town Hall to be presented to him, and some an MP in the Council he were looking for this colonel, but as I understand he was court-martialled after the war for racism and so I don't think he'd be wanting, wanted to be connected with Walsall any more, so but this was What was his name do you remember it? Colonel with a K the this band, they used to, that they had from the tenth replacement depot used to come down and play at the Town Hall, and they they like I said before they were fellas on the way to join Glen the absolute ultimate musicians of America and it was why I'm still today erm I've got a big collection of jazz records and have always been interested in the big band sound. It must have been quite exciting to hear them. Oh yes it was, very much so. They were brilliant times to live in he then me uncle Ed come on leave, from France, yeah I had a look at his rifle he used to bring all his equipment cos they didn't know if the units had moved when they got back and if they used to be lucky enough to get a leave, they used to have to bring all their equipment with them you see and he used to bring his rifle, everything on leave, and I, I always remember asking him why he hadn't, if he'd killed any Germans, why he hadn't got any notches on his rifle he erm Do you rec turning back to Helliwells again jumping about a bit Yes erm when did they stop doing work on aircraft there, do you recall about what year that would be? I can't, I can't remember precisely even so I think it, it, it's Walsall's loss that they haven't got an airport any more, it, it's purely but erm they, they did have a lot of s divided up into a lot of sports fields at one time didn't they but the people who've, is it the M E B who control those buildings now? I don't know it was TI wasn't it at one time. That that's right yes it was yeah and the airfield was divided up into football pitches and such like but er Did it continue as a sort of civilian airfield after the war? Oh no, no, no, not at all af after the war work it, it just seemed to er no one ever seemed to get any be interested in flying as they were pre-war then, or they probably that they had cars and they could get about more you know to other outlying places like Pentiford in Wolverhampton So that flying club that you mentioned earlier on just finished ? Oh yes when the war started yes, you, you see the people would have been called up into the forces anyway people young enough to fly, who, who had an interest, because er one of the air displays I remember very much a tomboy as she was she they used to give pleasure flights and she had defied this pilot to take her up and make her sick, and he was took her up there looping rolling and everything and er Do you recall the incident when Henry crashed there? No, not precisely I, I was a bit too young then, I, I remember all the songs about her Amy wonderful Amy and all those and oh and when she married Jim I was very much in but I couldn't actually say I remembered her crashing at Walsall The erm you could, yeah, when I came home from work one Monday afternoon my nan said this eighty eight had gone over very low, and we, we heard that they'd dropped this landmine this same aircraft had dropped this landmine that had gone under the gas holder at the gas works, in Road and the, they had some rescue workers from the A R P to get it out they never even bothered calling for the Royal Engineers, but the situation was that landmines used to come down on parachutes, and they used to slide into places which were inaccessible but anyway, they relied on the local Walsall A R P to get them out. The other time I remember was when William the chromium platers in Street ye got bombed, with a high explosive bomb, but there was, there was no one hurt that I remember, and then the Halleys the tent people had an incendiary bombs and got burnt out, at the same night that they dropped some incendiary bombs on the bus depot in Road, they, they were a lot of work for the fire brigade, but comparatively speaking with, with Birmingham I think Walsall got off very lightly as regards the bombing, as there was no heavy industry around here. I do believe there were, there was a high explosive bomb but I think it was just jettisoned to as you wanted to get back home the German pilot he, he landed somewhere up Bluebell Wood but it just exploded and no one was hurt. Where was that Bluebell Wood? At, at the back of the Three Crowns where that is now, I don't know whether if it was a bomb meant for the airport, I can't think that it was though it was a bit far away for that. Did they have any erm raids that were that you'd think were directed towards the airport at all, were there any incidents of this kind? No, no it was very much a green field area, and I think if they'd have wanted to get bomb anywhere they'd have been directed at Castle Bromwich, which were very much they were building Lancasters and Sterlings and they were very much the heart of the British bomber industry. We were only small fry really at Walsall airport. About how many erm planes would they have in during the week to repair, what was the, the turnover? Oh it, it wasn't there seemed to be a long time you know before they turned one out to make, because it was a very long process rebuilding an aircraft,es especially as the situation was at Walsall. I, I think it was only a drop in the ocean really towards the national effort, but, but I remember erm at Darlaston, they used to build tanks over there and they, they used to pay us visits in sometimes they'd send some of their men over in the tanks to give us a pep talk about the war effort and all that but er, they used to do things like that then to gee you up erm How many aircraft were they capable of working on at the same time? Oh they, they used to have several going through the hangers at one time they erm they probably had about six Harvards, and about nine Bostons which were, they were bigger than Blenning Bombers, er were these Bostons and Harvards they er quite a twin engine quite a wide wingspan and quite heavy for what they were, but as they were stripped down in, in the top hanger, and like I say a lot of stuff was salvaged from them, which was still good as they went out reconditioned at the other end. There were sometimes they, they came, if they'd been in action and er, the people had actually found blood and parts of the uniforms in the air gunner's compartment at the back, and the, the fella, the navigator u and bomb aimer used to be in the nose, they hadn't got much of a chance if they came down in there because they were right cut off from the rest of the aircraft so, but it was virtually a suicide position in the nose of the Bostons. They yeah we used to call in Tex and he, he couldn't believe that there were old people living in Walsall at the time in this country the size of England, and people living in Walsall that had never seen the sea in their lives, and this guy coming from America couldn't believe this. He, he was a real friendly guy and like I say he never said cheerio before he went, but one day he just painted his aircraft up with the D-day landing signs which we didn't know at the time and the next day he was gone of course it was very much top secret that was but the town just emptied of all Americans it was like a ghost town after them but it had been previously. It was like walking into Chicago at times in Walsall and the snowdrops as they used to call their military police with the white steel helmets on they used to ride around in jeeps. I first started to go when they were getting promotion to the second division the last few matches in the third division. When was that about, what year would that be? That would be about sixty, sixty one as I see, and er they were the last match of the season virtually was that they gained promotion on was Shrewsbury, which was at the game meadow and Arthur , the player manager who was a prolific goal scorer in his day, was playing at the time and er nobody expected Walsall to win but they ran out two-one winners and all down the A five that night all the pubs were full coming back with everyone celebrating, so erm, after then they had a civic dinner at the Town Hall for the players and they did a big flower display in the arboretum all set out in flowers the club badge and congratulation lads on winning promotion, and this when they kicked off the following season, in the second division, prior to that they played a friendly match against Leicester and Gordon was in goal and I took my boy with me Tim, who was only a toddler at the time, and he, I stood him on the old archway where the players used to run out, but the first league match was against Sunderland and Brian , actually played for Sunderland as centre forward and er Walsall ran out four-three winners in the end Tony , who was Walsall inside left got a hat trick and I believe Tommy , got the other goal and Brian scored for Sunderland, then the er we went on to the, the first away match which was at Derby County, and Walsall won that three-one. I think it was the impetus of them getting promoted and the enthusiasm the er then the next home match was against Newcastle which Walsall played to a packed house. There were twenty five thousand, I, I wouldn't like to see twenty five thousand on that ground again, because I, I used to smoke at the time and we were packed that tight in the ground I couldn't even get my hands down to my pockets to get a cigarette out, so the erm after the first few games they started to draw at home and then they seemed to lose the impetus and that they still held a good position in the league, but the following season Liverpool were in the second division at the time, and I, I went to that match and Walsall scored first through Colin and er, they went on to beat us six-one in the end. Can't tell you how long a journey it was back in the fog from Liverpool that day, and then when we were relegated back again to the third division it was on the last match of the season against Charlton, and the heavens opened and a big thunder storm and it just flooded the pitch and the referee just called the match off and they had to play it again the following Friday and Charlton ran out two-one winners and Walsall finished with nine fit men and still that's the football I suppose. Can you tell me something about the crowd itself, erm did particular age groups tend to stand together around the ground or were the young Oh oh oh not really, but it was when this chanting came in that the young fellas seemed to like gangs in the crowd and this when all the trouble started When would that have been about this were they in the second division then or Oh no no it would be ten fifteen years ago I think. The erm, yes these and it started to be like warfare more than a game you know at that stage but hopefully now we're getting back to some sort of sanity with the membership cards you know, because we, the crowd is segregated from the away supporters now and that's cos if Walsall go into the second division again they'll have to spend so much I believe on the ground to cage the away supporters in which they don't have to do in the third division. I was just discussing this last night, but they used to be more friendly atmospheres, even with the away supporters years ago you know it was but things go full circle in the end and hopefully like I say we're getting back to some sort of sanity now. Have you ever felt personally unsafe in the crowd? O only that night against Newcastle when they were, they were packed tight you know. It was just I, I went down they played Liverpool in the cup about that era, and the, the wall was pushed down at the Street end but erm the people just spilled on the pitch and I don't think anyone was really hurt, this happened when they played er Liverpool in the cup a couple of years ago the wall was pushed down at the other end on that occasion, but er there was just one, one person hurt but there wasn't anybody very seriously injured as I understand Were there any, were there any special chants or songs that the Walsall crowd used to put across Well, well they did try to get a song going once sponsored by the club, it was sung by St Matthews' choir would you believe, but it, it didn't seem to take off, the football supporters seemed to take very much to their own sort of songs, and they, they'd pick up songs and chants from other grounds now like the Liverpool song You'll Never Walk Alone, and they used to sing Away the Lads they used to pick that up from the Newcastle supporters and and Was there anything that was specifically Walsall chants Not that I can recall no the erm Were there any players that the crowds used to pick on especially in any way? No but Urging them on or putting them down. Well Tony , was who manager at the associated now, er he was very a very popular player, he was a goal scorer on one occasion, they played an away match at Swindon and he scored a goal and the goalkeeper got sent off a John so Tony went in goal and he saved a penalty later in the match, but he was a very popular player he was a a good goal scorer then there was Colin he, he had one of the hardest shots in the league you know, I've, I've seen the goalkeeper shrug his shoulders at, at defenders and say well how do you stop those, they used to call him Cannonball at one time, and er there was Tommy he had his collarbone broken and he never played again after, but he was a great centre forward he used to make a lot of space for the other forwards you know. Course when Walsall were promoted, they hadn't got into the European systems then it was very much the old five forwards three halfbacks two fullbacks and a goalkeeper in those days, the, the laundry was there, in those days when they were in the second division. That was laundry? That's right yes and they used to say that the stack was full of footballs been put up there by p opposing defenders. When the, the laundry was knocked down it seemed to be the end of an era that er, it didn't seem to be like park much longer. When did they knock that down? Oh, it was, that would be the late sixties I would think when they were in the erm third division. And how did they use that extra area, what did they do with the ? Well that that is now accommodation for away supporters down at there is no cover over it as yet, there were plans to make a covered stand of it but er they haven't it has been covered over and that's where the away supporters still stand to this day and a little bit around the corner at the bottom end, at the railway end as they call it now, not the laundry end. What about the Hilary Street end is that still open ? That, that's open to the general public but where I stand you have to have a membership card to go in there now, and er you pay two pound before the season started and er local traders give you a discount and things erm it's just one way of er segregating the supporters if you like, but there doesn't seem to be so much trouble since they've done this, but at the same time there doesn't seem to be as much atmosphere How do you mean in there. atmosphere, what's gone? Well all the support comes from one side of the ground, I mean when they score all the shouting comes from one side of the ground now and when Walsall scored all the shouting seems to come from the Street end and the erm So before it was erm all the way around the pitch, the response. That's right, yes, yes. What about away matches? Do they get much following from their supporters? Oh yes quite so and if they're doing well they really, local people really get behind them, but they, they've prom in previous seasons they they've promised so much and then fell away at the end that people have got a bit disillusioned and discontented so that, but like last year when they were doing well in the cup they erm at Watford I mean loads of people went to see them. My son and daughter-in-law went down. They made a four all draw and I think they've still got the video now on television of the match. How do most people go to away matches? Do they make their own way ? Their own transport and they do, do run coaches and er there are rail British Rail run the service as well as a rule. I don't think they've had a lot of trouble really speaking with Walsall supporters over the years because they seem to be er go to support the club not to fight and er What about home erm away teams coming to Walsall I mean is there ever any trouble as they arrive in the town? Well not any more. The last trouble I remember was when they played Birmingham City in the Cup last season. They reckon arrests were made down but they were down at Beskett Station and they made a couple inside the ground, but I think they were just people running on the pitch you know, they were over enthusiastic. Has there ever been any trouble down in the Pleck itself on match days? Well I, I As in pubs I have seen away supporters being chased up the road into Pleck Park and but erm I think basically a lot of the trouble used to be caused by drink and now they don't have any drink in the ground they er they, they seem to have cracked that one. Were there any teams that used to come and play at Walsall that were notorious in any way? Oh oh yes very much so they were Millwall and erm there were notably Millwall. Why, I mean what was the problem with them? Well they were noted even when cos Jim went down there a few, few times he used to have chaps running around the ground with chains and knives and all that sort of thing, but it's in the Dockland area of London Millwall. They used to be a real rough lot as I believe they are still now they've still got a name today they What about Port Vale I've heard people say they used to be a hard team to play. Yes but they never seem to have got a lot down at Walsall. To Tony was telling me that er he was asked that Walsall needed the money so he was asked to be transferred to Port Vale, which he did but er I think he was past his best and he, he'd came down back here and played a couple of times with Port Vale, and er but erm like I say he was past his best. He was a, got a record number of goals for Walsall in the season, it's never been broken to this day erm. Colin broke, I think he equalled a record for a leftwinger as well scoring goals we had er later on we had Bob came from Coventry, Coventry City. He played in goal for several years for Walsall. Where did people park their cars and all that when they go to the matches ? Round in Crescent and er the people make allowances often they make announcements in the ground of they're blocking somebody's entrance and will they go and move the cars out and I recall many years ago a lot of people used to go on bicycles and they used to leave them in the front of those houses that are just in . That, that's right yeah . The, the people used to charge them so much haven't they for parking the cycles yes. I, I used to walk it there when I went there,e even from Lane I never used to get on the bus I, I used to walk it down there cos we used to go down by the side of, of the old Street cemetery you know over by the gas works and up Street the erm What about the directors and managers? Oh oh yes Henry who was the chairman of the day then. When was that? In now I was reading about him pretty recently Never mind. Oh I, I can't put the year Just approximately was this in the nineteen sixties? Yeah, yeah, yeah and then erm the family took over. The ? The took over yes then and they would And what influence did they have on the Walsall Football Club? Well they, they seemed to be putting some finance in, but er it went through a bit of a flat spot and then the sold out I, I'm sorry I'm stuttering and all this but I haven't done my research you know and it, it's, it's tough going. Er . What sort of influence did the directors and managers have with choosing the team? Well the Bill was, who was the manager in those days was very much the manager, and there was one of the directors used to play for the Villa, and he used to more or less look after the playing side which the rest of the directors never seemed to interfere with, they, they left the management up to the manager the selection of the team, Bill and the trainer when they were in the second division was Arthur who's manager of Derby County now, he had the, I believe he had a sad time when he was at Walsall he, he lost his wife in a car accident and What about the ground itself? Was it a good ground to play on? Well they, they had to do the, it hadn't used to have very good drainage and far more of a slope, it, it's far more level today than it used to be, it used to have a great slope towards the long end which was considered an advantage to Walsall and the water used to gather, but I believe the improved the drainage and had pipes put under which it, it doesn't seem to gather water so much now down at the railway end. The since Terry took over the ground everything's been refurbished and new crush rails put up you know, and he seems to have made it a good ground. Quite, quite frankly I, I can't see Walsall moving, because it seems to have been money wasted if they've made Fellas Park good and then they move somewhere else. So I wouldn't like to see any property developers take it, the club on because I think they'd be purely after the ground, I, I'd feel much better if the consortium with Ray at the head took it over because they are genuinely interested in Walsall and the Walsall people. You said earlier that you go to reserve matches as well. I, I did do years gone by yes and they, they did move into the football combination at one time, because it was considered that the Midland Intermediate League was too big a jump for young men into the first team and the difference was so vast in the type of football that Walsall second team they u only playing young fellas, and they used to win seven and eight goal margins every week you know, but then they moved up into combination that was a better standard of football, but latter years economy drives and everything they came back out of the combination reverted to the Midland Intermediate again which I believe there are two phases of that no one for s older players and the other one strictly for youth players I was going to ask you if they'd got a youth team? Yes, yes, they're out of the youth cup now as I understand. I, I can't remember who knocked them out but erm they are out of that competition. Is the ground ever used for anything else apart from? No, no, it, it got oh er erm for other some local teams if have a final it's sometimes played down there. What sort of teams? In, in the days would they be? Of the er regime I saw erm Moscow, Moscow Dynamo came over and played Walsall in a friendly match yes erm Was there a good crowd for that one? Oh yes very good. There was about ten to fifteen thousand, which the limit on the, the ground limit today is about seventeen to eighteen as I can understand. And is it the same size ground as the match when there was twenty five thousand in you say you were a bit bothered about it in fact? Virtually but the laundry was there then there, there wasn't so much room then you see. Because of all those extra people in there? Because there was no one at the bottom end, but they've, they've got all those extra people in it, it was really frightening when I look back, but the, the reason there could have been, there were er nineteen thousand at the Sunderland match but it was an all ticket game so they restricted the crowds somewhat. Have Walsall always played in the same colours as long as you've been supporting them? Yeah they, they've played in red and white, red, white, red shirts white shorts, but they, they used to play in claret and blue I can remember seeing them in claret and blue when I was a small boy but erm What used to go to the matches when you were a lad? Whenever I could afford it you know, but erm, there wasn't so much money in those days I can't remember exactly how much we, we used to get in for coppers you know. Did your wife go to the matches with you? She has been a couple of times but er when we were bringing up the family course she couldn't reasonably go with me every week and er, but she had used to be er a good supporter when she was a girl, she used to go with her father in those days my son's been with me, cos I took him las well he took me last night with his wife I went in their car . Are there a lot of women supporters? Yes, yes, quite a good few I would think. Do they make themselves heard in the crowd as well? Oh yes, yes, if er they don't like the referee they'll let him know it some of the decisions Do you think the town supports the club enough? Well, not really but they have been disillusioned over the years they've promised so much and then they've never seemed seemed to get anywhere but I think, I honestly think they would, people would get behind them, if they could see they were going somewhere I mean like this season they seem to have fallen away yet again. Why do you think the reason for this is? Well they've wanted a mid-field player and a good striker, now people well write letters to local press informing them of this, but they don't seem to be prepared to do this, they, the managers want to do their own thing as far as I can see they think the people on the terraces don't know anything, but Jim and I were saying last night they wanted a mid-field player for ages now all this season, a ball winner, they haven't had one since Willie used to play and Is it lack of funds? Can they afford to buy a good player? Well, well they've just sold a player to Leicester for eighty five thousand and they, they bought a fella from Port Vale on a free transfer, well he's a Richard they've bought him back again, only with a, all due respect but er now he's got he's playing very well with Leicester now, and he's, he's scored two goals and made one the other Saturday, and, and everyone, every match since he's been there every time he's played. So I can't see that it's justified you keep letting your best players go people do get illusioned and people aren't fools, they're gonna stop away aren't they if they thinking they're not doing anything to get going anywhere. Is it a dedicated core of supporters that go ? Oh yes very much so very much so there always has been, yeah they used to call them the faithful four thousand at one time. They erm and, and some of the characters they in days gone by they used to dress up in costume if they were doing well in the Cup and have er a pole with a model of the F A Cup on Walsall's colours and they used to dress up in red and white suits claret and blue suits when they played in those colours yeah. But did they used to walk round the ground like that? Yeah and they used to have a man dressed up as Charlie Chaplin and he used to do his antics on the pitch before the players came out yeah. Who was he, was he local? Erm my nan remembers him, was it somebody called , no no he was another character I think he sold newspapers, but erm I do, I do remember him er They've always erm tried to get some entertainment on the pitch though prior to the matches to try and make it a family thing you know, I, I think Watford are the best club for that you know, because they, the supporters seem to take all the family along, as my son said when they went down there to the Cup replay they are very much a family sort, they don't get a lot of trouble at Watford either. Are there a lot of families that follow Walsall in the same way? Well I, I think after this er people haven't appreciated yet that they've, the grounds have become a bit safer than they were the hooligan element seemed to be taking over, they have er closed circuit television now, at Walsall, so they can get to the hot spot of any trouble and er they erm the ground So a lot of people have been put off have they do you think Y oh yes very much so their families down? Cos when I, I used to take Tim, it used to be very safe then, the only danger we seemed to be in in those days was catching cold. I took Tim to the match one Easter Monday they played Luton in league match, and Ted played, the old Ipswich player, and we go absolutely, it rained, hailed, blew, and we got home soaked to the skin you know, and er it seems to make you feel better if they win you know, but if you sort of put up with those sort of things and they, they lose it's makes you feel right down in the dumps, but when they get promoted like they did last time it's remarkable, it's been remarked about this aspect, that people in local industry seem to work harder, and it seems to be a boost in general local traders make shop window displays and it seems to be a boost to the town in general and give a lift to the town if you like What about other crowd noises are the people who take rattles and No they've been banned from taking them in in case they clobbered anyone with them you see oh they were banned some time ago, as were flags they used to carry flags at one time and rattles, but er they don't let you take anything in. As, as a matter of fact, my son you know those di things you have like you have for the television like a switch box? Oh a remote control Re remote control yes, well my son has one of those he has an electric garage door on his house, and a copper frisked him before he went in last season cos he, he's a younger bloke and er he said what's this and he pulled it out of his pocket, he said it's to open my garage door with he said what do you think it is a death ray or something yeah. Are there any refreshments available at the ground? Yeah well they don't sell er drink any more, not alcoholic drink but there are, there are tea, pies and those sort of things available. Who runs that? Is it part of the supporters club? Yeah it is now, yeah they used to have private caterers at one time but I believe it's, it's part of the club now and the profit making concern. Do they sell scarves and that sort of thing? Oh yes yeah outside yes and old programmes they sell at away matches, badges, season tickets as you might understand,but they, they are going to have a good day in April on the centenary day because they have it getting all the old players Tony says he, he's been invited to attend as well and Gilbert I believe will be going and erm It should be a good day. Yeah yeah a good Da Dave manages Doncaster now he's an ex manager of Walsall as well We lived at the Brown Lion at the time and er, I, I was out the front on the Saturday evening and I er manager's just been to fetch his Sunday joint from the local butchers and he shouted across the road to his pal how have they got on, cos there was no radio in those days, and er he says they've won two nil and the man dropped his meat in front of him and dribbled it all the way down the road, it was such excitement it was of course all people over the moon. That's what the country was it was always to be remembered feat a giant killing match of all time. People still talk about when they beat the Arsenal as though it was only last season almost don't they? Yes, yes. I don't think it will ever be forgotten. No no no well it's always it was then like a team of pygmies beating Liverpool today that's what it ranks with. throwing this out as an idea that we perhaps we offer one half of this amount here Yeah. erm each side to pay its own costs Yeah. and we get the s to pay half of the half. Yeah. Well if worst comes to worst and they don't accept that Aha. speaking on my own for my own personal point of view erm if they if they insist they want this full amount Yeah. would it be possible for me to pay my half of that and the s pay the other half because I'm not i it it's really started to worry me and concern me a lot I'm now I'm sure that's right and includes a lot of interest as well That's right yeah building up every day really. I mean The object as far as I'm concerned is to try and kill it as quickly Yeah. as we can cos of the cost side erm I'm not happy about the way they've drawn up the writ because it doesn't say precisely wh it doesn't say what that invoice says it's only No. because we've done some digging around that we've actually got that information Mm. it doesn't say it it was at Newark erm and I think you've got reasonable prospects of knocking it back because of the problems you had with towards the end. So I think you know erm we've got no proof they were labelled deliveries or customers complaints or Er I mean the interest is one thousand one hundred quid so Yeah. we're talking about three six aren't you at the end of the day that's what they're trying to apply for. Erm I'll start on the basis that we offer one two fifty. Yeah. What I want to do is clear that with Mr and Mrs as well pay half of that Yeah. I think So does that sound okay to you? It sounds very good yeah But you're saying anywhere between those two figures personally you will pay half of the two thousand five hundred and eighty nine Just to finish it off yeah. I mean if they insist they want all that I mean I'll if they insist they want the interest as well then I'm in er a bit of a spot Yeah. Okay leave it with me. I'll er telephone them possibly I'll telephone them tomorrow and see whether we can sort something out. Thanks a lot them Mr . Okay I'll be in touch . I feel a little bit better at least. Yeah. Thank you anyway. Alright. Cheerio then . Ta-ta. Er shall I pop in tomorrow with the two hundred pound for Norwich then? Er yes if you wouldn't mind. Okay then. It may be that we don't have to use all of that. Obviously you'll get a refund if I can solve Yeah. this fairly quickly. Okay then Mr . Thanks a lot. Alright. Cheerio. Bye. up and call me now A little music as well we have on the show we have a video from Elvis to give away in the second half of the programme and star guest this afternoon is Mary Whitehouse. Oh ho ho Steeley Dan and erm reeling reeling out the thingummybobs. Hello that's a nice way to start it isn't it? Good morning good afternoon whatever you like to call O never mind you know the number. Now er we're going to start this morning talking about animals. More specifically why we're so cruel to them. Britain must be an animal erm a country of animal abusers looking at the statistics. Why do we hate animals so much? If you have a view on that O nine O four six four one six four one and I'd like to hear from you all you have to do is pick up the phone and give me a f a call now sorry. Did Karen say to somebody on that thing did I hear her say, What are you on? She looked at me and said that when I walked in this morning. What are you on? I didn't like to tell her is was Phylisan but there we are. Anyway erm we've been hearing on this programme recently of course that er people are against hunting against fishing er they say it's cruel. But they are willing quite willing apparently to give and receive pets as presents and millions of them end up getting abused neglected and destroyed. Every year we see that doleful little puppy on the television screen and every year thousands of people give pets for Christmas. The R S P C A have to pick up the pieces and they've launched a campaign to try and stop it and joining me now is Alan. Is this Alan Oritt, Alan? Correct yeah. OK you're the Superintendent for the north east of England that covers this area too. I'm the Chief Superintendent that covers the the north east of England yes. OK. So you're the big boss are you? One of them. One of them. Have you er polished your brass today got it all ready to talk to me I hope you have. Now sorry Alan I've got to turn you up a bit you don't mind do you? No not at all. It won't hurt there we are that's nice OK. Now Alan, first of all er have we learned anything do you think over the years or do we seem to be getting worse? Sadly the things seem to be getting worse. Er we the Society try our very best to get over the message to people just before Christmas. Please don't give a pet for Christmas. But unfortunately er it seems to fall on many deaf ears and we the Society as other many charities who deal with animals are left to pick up the pieces. Why is it it seems to me also, and I may be totally wrong here, but it seems people who are least likely to look after themselves are the ones who want to have animals? I mean you see them walking around particularly people who go for the big dogs, you see them walking around with a big thick necks, the tattoos, the er the boots and the jeans rolled up. Well I think that's a little bit to do with a bit of macho image. Erm and er perhaps it's the owners wanting to look rather big. Unfortunately they don't think before they get the pet that you've got to look after it. It takes But an an time it takes money. Another thing is of course it's all pets it isn't just dogs and cats. That's right yes. I mean people have er er budgie or er er er another sort of bird and they think it doesn't need any looking after. That's right. Er just before Christmas you see people think that buying a Christmas present er that's easy. Once you've er got over the newness of it the the the thing can be put in away in a drawer can be put back in it's box. But with an animal it's for life. Er you've got to look after it. You've got to devote a lot of time to the care and attention that it requires. I I heard the other day what I thought was one of the best advertisements not to have an animal for Christmas very emotive, er I think it was for the R S P C A, and I I'm told I don't think you've heard it but it b basically it's it's er the sound of a er well it's a human pretending to be a dog really and saying you know, Well this is nice my my er family have taken me to the vet, I didn't think I was ill but never mind. Oh here comes a nice man with er an injection. Ah perhaps they're going to give me some vitamins. Yes. And it goes on and on like this until the voice is erm, I can't feel anything any more. Yes it's it's it was one of the er advertisements or programmes that went out on radio er again this is why I've been trying to get over to people the sad things that have to happen to animals. Erm we hate putting animals to sleep. In fact it was the Society's policy now that we won't put animals to sleep unless there is an extreme er cause for that the sick, diseased. Erm and we're attempting to try to get over to people please please think before you get a pet. Why is it that in the north of England, particularly in this region of the north of England, we seem to be worse than anywhere else? I I don't think you are. Now I've spent seventeen years in Hartlepool and yes that er They hate monkeys in Hartlepool did you know that? Found a honkey they monkey I wasn't going to say anything the Kirkham Hotel. they hung it. Er yes and there's one hanging behind their door. Er the thing is that the people in the northeast yes er there is a lot more work done up there by the Society but you know since I've been down in Horsham I have found that the northeast is not alone. There are many other areas in the country where animals are seriously abused. The northeast isn't the only place. Mm. Ok thank you very much indeed er Chief Superintendent. And Pa Pat I don't think I don't hold out any hope at all that people will pay any attention they will go they'll see a little puppy somewhere they'll say, Oh that's lovely we'll buy that for Tommy er, and then Tommy will abuse it totally and er they'll say, Well the dog was a a waste of time it didn't work properly and er didn't know how to er how to look after itself. May I just say that the majority of people will care for their animals but it is those people who buy, we have s er cases where erm people will turn up on Christmas day and say to their elderly relative, We bought you a puppy. The elderly relative hadn't didn't want a puppy. Never ever wanted a puppy because it makes them a captive person Mm. they've got to look after something. And this is where the Society is called in er to look after that puppy. Or just after Christmas usually between Christmas and New Year. We're called to waste ground, behind pet shops, a any place to pick up boxes of unwanted puppies, kittens that have obviously been er planned for selling to people er before Christmas. Good Alan thank you very much indeed. You're very welcome. Let er let's hope it'll mm won't be like that er mm this er this year. Now he says deep intake of breath don't have a puppy for Christmas. Do as I do have turkey instead. I'm playing this one because I like it. It's a little a little fresh Cajun music from New Orleans from the and I can say that er that's why I'm playing it really. O nine O four six four one six four one any calls about dogs or er any other sort of animal you want to give us a ring call us now. which er er probably rude I dunno it's just . Er B B C radio York you are not in the South of France but as it is persistently snowing around the county at the moment I thought you know a little French flavour. Was it the Beaujolais Nouveau wasn't it this week was it? Everybody seems to be nodding around here I thought it was Thursday it was wasn't it? Could anybody bring us a bottle down here you know because that would be nice wouldn't it on a on a cool Saturday afternoon here as we sit overlooking the grand metropolis of York. It would be nice to have just a little swig of the erm of the new grape. Has anybody tasted it? I haven't tasted it anybody taste give me a call. I cos quite frankly I have never heard such an exciting R S P C A man as that last one so I don't expect to get much response to that. Er so let's talk about the, can't hear can he he's not up in this area? No he doesn't know does he? Er stuff it. Ah anyway so erm I don't think anybody's bothered about er fish and chips arrived have they? Everybody's in there. Thing about this programme it is so it is so crucial to everything that goes on at Radio York while it is happening, they eat in the other room that's how much er interest there is they eat in the other room. Tour buses around York. Should they be banned? Should we get rid of them? Is York a big enough city to have them? You know the open topped buses where they go round they hold up the traffic. I know the tourists are very important to York but for goodness sake it isn't a huge city can't they walk round? Why can't they walk round? I think if we got rid of all those open topped tour buses in York, traffic would be a lot easier. What do you think? Give me a call you know the number O nine O four six four one six four one. You can ring now. You can ring about anything you want actually. Anything you feel like you can ring I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm really you know. Shame of the Killer oh no I don't think we'll do that er look through the Sun see if there's anything interesting erm in there I've got nothing in the Ewbank . Boxer Chris Ewbank worth around eight million is moaning that he's got no money. What has he done with his money? What has got he didn't give me any. Oh he's bought a big house has he? OK. Usual sort of sex, drugs, rock and roll as you get in the papers on a Saturday as well. Or is he the best dress man too? Chris Ewbank is the best dressed man. That'll upset Jonathan Ross he always thought he was. Er O nine O four six four one six four one. Anybody who can hum by the way the er theme to the television programme Ivanhoe and I would be interested to hear from you as well. Now as the United Nations doesn't have enough on its plate dealing with the problems on earth and obviously they're er they're there at the forefront of everything that happens . Action is being demanded to track down possible visitors from outer space and this is serious. A small group demonstrators have staged a protest outside the U N Headquarters in New York calling for an end to what they say is a cover up over the existence of U F Os. One of the organizers, Michael Luckman, says President Clinton is scared to acknowledge that superior beings do exist. The United States er government is afraid as are other governments to admit er to their people that there is a higher form of life. Obviously if the U F Os touch down that would mean they would be charge and not Bill Clinton at the White House. Okay well er I I figure that there must be quite a number of er extraterrestrials around around North Yorkshire and I thought it would be quite nice actually if er if there are any extraterrestrials listening at the moment they could ring in and we could have a chat. So if erm if if you yeah yes E T E T phoned when what do you want? I'm not even speaking to you because of that flipping letter.

On the A one in the Bedale area there's still a mobile lane closure in operation on the north bound carriageway. That's between Bedale and Catterick at the moment and slight delays are possible there. Also on the A one in the Leeming area the inside lane of the south bound carriageway's closed at Holby Grange for emergency gas repair works and delays are likely as a result there. In Selby there's a demonstration taking place this afternoon it starts at half past one and will go via Barlby Road and Scott Road and some traffic delay delays are likely as a result. Also in York today traffic near to the Knavesmire could be slow due to an event taking place there. In the Ripon area weekend roadworks mean the Road will be closed as it passes under the A one bridge delays are likely as a result. At Stockton on Forest Stockton main bridge over the A sixty four is closed for resurfacing work through to six o'clock on Monday morning. And finally in the Thirsk area there are no further reports of snow on the high ground there but some moorland routes may still be a little slippery. Danny Savage A A Roadwatch.

Hello I'm fine thank you. What are you on here for? Because er because I was invited on to speak about current educational issues Oh that's good I couldn't you see it's very difficult for me you know I have to look up there I can never distinguish one one one call from another. Right. Do you have a tit do you want me to your a title do you have er? I'm Press Officer for North Yorkshire National Union of Teachers. Yeah. Yo you're very lucky actually Noel that this is not erm a quiz show. Shall I tell you for why? Why? I'll tell you why cos the B B C there's a directive just gone out I've just been informed the B B C for quiz show hosts on the B B C to treat their guests with a little more civility. Can you believe it? How much more flipping civil can you get. Have you heard these quiz sho I mean they're all on radio four aren't they? All the quiz show yeah basically ? Well rad radio one as well. Mm Where do you live anyway? In Leeds. Oh good. Mm it's freezing outside isn't. It certainly is yes. What are we talk oh education we're talking about education right yep. Okay let me do the prog right er Noel that's a funny name Noel by the way isn't it? It's erm appropriate for the time of the year nearly . Mm It's like pulse but not. Oh oh er yes. Is that how you pronounce it? Erm it it is pronounce to Not the Noel y yeah okay. Anyway right so erm head teachers in the area have been complaining their schools are not tidy not cleaned sufficiently. Yes. Why? I mean why why are our children going to school in in pig sties? Well I think it's er down to the competitive tendering process where the County Council has had to put out the cleaning contracts for schools to tender. There were problems a few years ago when it first started with th the initial contract which was was won by the the County's own direct service organization and now it seems we're having a repeat of of those problems. Er with the new contracts that started in September erm basically it seems that some teachers are having to do bits of cleaning themselves to keep their their classroom up to up to scratch up to the standards they ought they ought to be. Erm we're hearing reports that parts of schools having to to be closed or th threatened to be closed because they're not sufficiently hygienic for pupils or teachers to work in. Oh how disgusting. And er That is isn't that disgusting? It certainly is yes . That is disgusting yes. So all these a lot of these firms are not up to the job why do why don't you sack them people are not up to the job why don't they get sacked? Well there are monitoring systems which are meant to be in place a and which may be er are not are not effective enough erm. I mean I've heard representatives for County Council th this week saying that er as far as they were concerned th the standards weren't sufficiently low yet for them t to take action. But basically th every time the contract comes up for renewal, what will happen for a company to attempt to win the contract it's got to cut the hours of its employees and its also got to try and c cut the costs erm by cutting pay and that's the way that's the way contracts are won in this situation and as long as that keeps happening then the situation's going to get steadily worse. What are we going I mean we we've heard also I'm changing the subject now because that was the the sort of political answer I'd expect and er I suppose until I get somebody else come on and say he's talking absolute whatever er I mean I think it is down to the people who live and work with the school. I think if you all make a mess you should be severely reprimanded quite frankly expect other people to come round and pick up your mess. Well that's something that a as a teacher we're erm in my school we're constantly saying t to the pupils I mean if they ha they have a they have a certain responsibility t to tidy up after them and t to try and keep their work area tidy that's not the same as er as cleaning at the end of the day as sweeping up all all the dust and and so on. What about this mum's army of teachers is this going to come to fruition as some point or not? I don't I don't believe it is erm at the mo well earlier this week a report was published by the National Commission on Education which was er an independent erm Commission that was set up erm and they they've said that basically what we need to be doing is t if we're trying to raise standards is to keep the idea of having an all graduate profess profession followed up by high quality for train training for teachers once they've actually started work. The problem there is that graduates are so terribly boring and uninteresting people basically aren't they that they find it difficult to impart their er You would? I would yes. You're a graduate. I am yes. Yeah I thought so anyway. Er I would have thought that graduates find it more difficult to impart knowledge to people than anybody else. No I'd I'd I don't I don't believe that that's the case erm Karen come to the studio please. Karen come to the studio please. Karen co sorry I just want to do something go on. Yeah so okay I'm I'm I'm I don't think that's the case. I'm I'm winding you up a little bit but no I mean there's a little method in this . When are the teachers going to stop being political animals and get down to teaching rather than try to score points off the Government? Oh we're Cos anybody can score points off them I mean it's simple. We we well we'd love to be able to get get on with our job and er wi with far less interference than we receive at the moment but er when government insists on er on interfering to the extent it does an and there have been well I've been reading recently so something like five hundred new powers the Education Secretary has given himself in the in over the last last few years. Well he's not going to be there for ever. Decisions are made decisions are made erm there that we and we have to live with the consequences of them. If they affect education then it's our responsibility to speak up about them. You see I I think er er probably one of the best erm Ministers of er of er Education that er has been for quite some considerable time and I bet you throw your hands up in horror when I say this you will totally disagree and I'm talking here cos his name's just slipped out of my mind . Who was tha who was that oh for goodness sake tall thin gaunt looking man, always had to have about fifteen spoonfuls of sugar in his coffee whenever I met him? S Sir Keith Joseph? Er you knew you see Sir Keith Joseph. Now I I remember talking to him for hours once on a programme about education and this was when he first said what we want is teachers to be accountable. And I'm a great believer in everybody should be accountable right? Yes. We well I've no objections to that to that at all. No none of you do now but when he first suggested it everyone was up in arms and he poor old soul I remembered he said, I've had enough change I I believe in this I I've I've tried I'm too old now and out he walked. Is there a chocolate machine in the building? And off he went. He was addicted to chocolate. I I I think erm a lot of teachers would now look back on those days with er a certain fondness now bearing in mind what's what's happened since and the the the succession of education secretaries we've had since since then I mean had the only one in recent years who I would say has attempted a genuine dialogue with the teachers and tried to do something constructive is John McGregor. So when, and I would agree with you again, so when are the teachers going to be accountable, when is somebody who is a bad teacher and heck there are quite a few of them, you know it only takes a couple in every school to make it difficult for the rest, going to be got rid of you know you are not up to the mark out. There there are systems in place in schools already for that and there always have been. You jest with me now come on we're we're we're being serious Noel if you are a teacher it is almost impossible to sack you. Almost totally impossible. That's simply not true. There there are disciplinary procedures in in all schools erm which are there to be used. Why are they never used then? Are all teachers too good to be sacked because it is it is as rare as erm teeth in chickens. I think it's I think it's very easy to er to ex exaggerate the problem to take one anecdotal evidence of of one about one or two cases and maybe about one or two people and say this is a major problem in every school. Let me put it this way to you Noel I don't think it is. Let me put it to you this way you know as well as I do people who really ought to be doing something else other than teaching. You know that as well as I do and those people don't seem to be given the encouragement to move on to another profession. I I Some are some are promoted to head teachers I know and I knew you were going to say that. I wasn't going to say that no . Erm no I I honestly don't think that er that the the problem is as big as as big as you you say it is and I I think the the structures are there to deal with that and if if people had you know if people used them then they would they would work and they from time to time that they are used and you know it it is not impossible to get rid of rid of a teacher in in the way you are suggesting. Okay Noel thank you for your er your time and being a good sport this afternoon and I hear you have a little one you had better go back and sort things out. That's right. Okay. Okay thanks. Thanks a lot Noel bye bye. Noel from the er N U T. Erm I don't know what this is serious point actually if if you fancy yourself as one of these so called mums and I think it is a little patronizing the er title of a mums' army of teachers, if you think that maybe you could do that and you'd be interested in doing that and you think it's quite a good idea I'd be interested in hearing from you, all right? O nine O four serious talk O nine O four six four one six four one erm if you'd like to do that give me a call. Now where is er where is Rita where are you Rit all right my love all right where's Rita I've got I've got yellow I've got red I've got blue I've got green. What number is Rita on give me a number because I haven't got white? Twenty four Okay right if I put that down there Rita hi. Hi. How are you? I'm fine thanks . Hang on let me do that again that's good that isn't it? Makes a little noise click click click click. Can I have a chip does anybody hi Rita Hi. Lovely Rita meter Oh don't please. I hate that isn't it awful to be obvious. Well that's what everybody sings to me when them and they meet me for the first time or get introduced to me. Oh they don't. Where are you calling from we're very loud with callers today I know I'm not the most exciting thing on radio but you know there must be some callers out there somewhere? Where am I. I'm at a little place called Ellenthorpe. Ellenthorpe. Is the weather as bad as people keep telling me because it was Okay when I drove in this morning. No it's not it's it's quite mild, there's no frost on the ground it's all gone. So what's this about snow at Thirsk? Well they can keep it we don't want it. Bit strange in Thirsk anyway I thought. I think there'd probably somebody with expanded polystyrene ceiling that's been pulled out. Probably. Yeah it's it's actually it's not too bad it's a bit misty it's a bid hazy erm slight wind but it's not bad. It's not? No it's not bad No Okay. I've just got to get something do you mind? No go and get your chips or whatever. No I've got I've got I wanted t It's all right my hubby can wait for his lunch I aren't bothered. Jolly well ought to as well. Er I wanted to talk to Jim Bowen you see about this quiz show host ought to be a a little nicer than they are and apparently his answer machine is on at home. Well I must admit James I've threatened to put mine on. Have you? Well Karen said that if I won the competition she'd ring back. Mm and then you thought, Oh God I've done it now . But I had to speak to you you see and I dialled you while you actually said on the air that anyone that won had to speak to you and said to Karen look if you ring back I'll put the answer phone on . I know I thought that was good because then everybody puts the phone down you see and they all think they're going to be terribly clever. Yes I think it depends on what kind of a message you actually have on your recorder to start off with. Is your's rude. No it just says that it's basically to the effect of that the answering machine is quite reliable I I and if you leave a message it will be dealt with and people do leave a message, whereas before when it just said I'm sorry I'm not available they didn't they just put the phone down. I usually leave a message saying I'm having sex at the moment ring back in about three seconds. And do they? Sometimes sometimes they never ring back at all ever. I should've just say you're bragging. Yes you're right, you been speaking to my wife? Well yeah we'll probably use the same supermarket I don't know. So listen I wan er er so is there any snow out there at all anywhere? No no hon There's not. Any chips out there ? Well to be honest Ja I can't see that far normally from where I live I can see the White Horse bank but it's shrouded in mist at the moment erm no I can't see so I couldn't tell you whether there there is snow up there or not. Okay. I also I I also erm er what was I going to say I would take the disc but I can't find a way of getting into this machine actually it's broken erm . It sounds about par for the B B C. Young Danny, the big boss now weekend said er take a disc take a disc and I said yeah well it's knackered er erm. What? Sorry. I'm doing that talking to you look for Jim Bowen's mobile phone number so I thought we'd give him a ring that'll surprise him wont it? Yeah. Okay er Can the B B C afford these phone calls? I don't think so no I don't think so at all that's why they don't call anybody back. Oh well you can call me back. Erm oh hang on just a minute can you hang on there? Yeah Well hubby's waiting I'll I'll get to you in a minute. for his lunch but it doesn't really matter. No stuff that who cares? Er hungry. He well so am I. Actually I was hoping someone's going to bring in some er some some Nouveau Beaujolais Nouveau cos a new one came out on Thursday. Is there nobody round here listening that can erm that could bring in some Beaujolais Nouv no no little Off Licence that will do this free publicity on the B B C to come in a say, Look I'm an odd bin or something like that ? I I thought the B B C I thought the B B C couldn't advertise then? No the B B C can't. But you can? Well. You're the exception to the rule I suppose? Yes you wait till you get severely beaten and then you say I'm very sorry I didn't mean to do that. Hang on hang on I've got Rachael from er from Guide Friday Buses. Oh golly hang on just a minute . I think I think I think you've probably stirred a hornets nest up with that. Hang on just a minute. Er Rachael? Rachael? Hello. Is that you Rachael? Yes it is. God I've I've been in love with you ever since I met you all those where are you at the moment? I'm actually in the office in Tower Street over looking Are you? Clifford's Tower. Why don't you wonder over here? There isn't actually a bus in oh yes there is a bus in sight. Why don't you wonder over here and bring a bottle of wine and we'll share it over the next hour of the show. Oh I can't I've got things to do in the office, a busy company here. I never did like those open topped buses. Well unclear So I'll be back to you. at the moment I can see about half well a dozen people sat on one of the buses. Can you? Yes. No wonder there's no traffic moving out there today. There is traffic moving, it's moving quite freely apart from the cars going into the car park just behind Clifford's Tower. Is that right? That's right yeah. There's never any spaces behind Clifford's Tower so I don't know how you're just telling me fibs aren't you? Well they're all they're all queuing up to go in there so I not sure. I just don't understand all these buses with the open tops it's freezing out there and all these tourists look they could walk Rachael. Well are tourists They could walk, why don't they walk? It's a seven kilometre tour. It takes an hour and a lot of people don't want to walk around the city they'd like the option of going around on the bus. What did the Minister of Health say the other day? Obesity obesity and lack of exercise. and that's what you're encouraging Rachael . Not encouraging lack of exercise we're encouraging an informative tour around the city with a qualified guide. You still got that beautiful blonde hair? We're not on the air are we? No no no we're not on the air. Heaven forbid I wouldn't talk to you like this if we were on the air would I ? Anyway so go on. Right. What were we talking about? So you don't mind Talking about the buses. Yeah. So I mean I think it'd great Guide Friday you run around little flag in the air, I've seen them in London and you can do that and and and people get so fit. Not that you need to be any fitter than you are. Well they are fit cos they get on and off at any of the stops they go along to the attraction that they want to do. Yeah I walk from my front door to my car as well and people say that's not enough exercise. Well the a there's the Barbican Centre for the exercise perhaps they should encourage the tourists there then. Mm Forgetting all about oh dear I've got a frog when I go on the air I'll clear that. Er can you hang on a minute? Yes certainly. I just got a we commercial breaks call you back in a minute don't go away yet. Rita? Rita? Oi Rita where's Rita gone. You cut her off well get her back on. Get her back on or she's not having this I'm sorry about that hang on just a minute block your ears I'm just going to spin round again okay hang on oops er are you their Rachael are you there? I'm here yes. Oh you are okay fine good got you. I can't open me thing here. the the er music blowing machine. There's a problem hang on. are you do you ever go in for karaoke and stuff stuff like that? No I don't. Yeah all right never mind about the photo give me your teddy I don't care about that. Er Rachael Yeah. Yeah what are you doing this evening? I'm going to Seaham this evening. Seaham who? Seaham up in er County Durham. Oh I know yeah I know Seaham yeah. What were are you doing? I thought I want it on the C Ds. Oh right sorry. I should think so. Playing with me knobs. Look hang on I've got one queu are you all right there Rachael? Hello. Do you get fed up with people saying, Are you really like that one in Coronation Street? No I don't actually cos I'm nothing like her . Erm You look similar. Well that's er that's a insult. It's not. It is. Yeah. I thought when we did we did that programme out to lunch in the summer and you came along and we talked all about buses and er your organization and I I I was very nice to you actually. You were very pleasant. And didn't say you know, It's flipping these tour buses in York that cos all the other people trouble because you can't get anywhere they clog the roads up.

Now do I do it over the music across the north I do it over the music Okay right here we go . Across North Yorkshire and around the world this is Radio York from the B B C. Health workers from North Yorkshire join a day of action in London to protest at the Government's health policies. Almost eighty people have been killed in a toy factory fire in China and site workers from Middlebrook Mushrooms marched through Selby to mark the first anniversary of their dispute. B B discussions are still taking place with Northamptonshire county council and into some other current secure unit provider authorities as to how best Leicestershire can work with other local authorities in the region towards this objective. Neither Whitehall,nor government nor this county council, nor the children we're talking about would welcome being used as a political football by Mr . Here, here . Thank you Mr . Dr , any supplementaries on your question? Yes er to the for former question er Chairman. Er, what am I to tell the people in London and partic in particular er when they say that the government and the county council is letting them down? Mr Er, Chairman the, the only advice that I can give Dr on that point is to say that the county council is not letting them down er the funding for major road schemes is provided by central government and we make a contribution towards it but if central government do not give us permission to go ahead with the race road scheme in terms of a grant, then in fact it will not go ahead and in that situation they may be let down, that is their judgement and that should be reflected in the way they vote at parliamentary elections. Mr , any supplementaries, thank you Mr . Mr Thank you Mr Chairman any supplementaries I have two supplementary questions. First one concerning A. In view of the level of con concern expressed on police funding, would the chairman of the Police authority agree that some f that some protection of Police funds locally and nationally may be necessary. Mr Yes, thank you, thank you, er thank you Mr councillor erm. Can I can I say that in my opinion that the county council's current budgeting strategy which effectively imposes a two percent efficiency saving which I might add in figures come to something like one point five million erm is, is of concern but what is of greater concern is the further possibility of a four percent er reduction which is being sought in blocks of three percent and one percent next year for ninety four ninety five which is to the amount of two point eight million at the current prices will in my opinion decimate the present level of service provision in policing. Erm. Community policing will be further marginalised with priority going to intermediate response type of incidents I am confident however that this council will make some crucial and vitally important decisions during the next er budget rounds and the importance of policing an inadequately funded service will be unanimously supported. Can I also add that representations to the Secretary of State for the Home Office will be central er component to secure those adequate resources with the Leicestershire Police erm, erm service needs. Thank you. Thank you Mr Does the Chairman share my concern regarding the Home Secretary's proposals containing the white paper on Police which will dramatically reduce local accountability of the Police service to the Leicestershire public. Mr I'm grateful chair, once again for Mr on that er second supplementary. The real danger of course is the forthcoming Police bill the proposal which were instituted by the present er Treasurer,erm er the Chancellor er and instituted further on by the present Home Secretary would lead to a centrally appointed Police committee at least fifty percent and a centrally appointed chairman, paid by the Home Secretary much rather like the Leicestershire Health Authority and of course this will severely undermine the local democratic accountability of the Police service. Can I also add that it will also instigate centrally determined policing policies, very much akin to other government policies, particularly economic policies which have, as yet, done nothing to address the underlying causes of crime and there are fears and I'm quoting here from the er the response made by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the Association of County Councils and the Association of District Councils that it could lead to a national Police force. But what is important is that there is opposition er Chairman at the national level which is set to continue and once again representations are being undertaken er to be made to local Members of Parliament and to Members of the House of Lords. But it is of concern and I do hope that in the next forthcoming er house er when the the house sits in the forthcoming rounds, that they will be mindful of the representations which have been made nationally and that the Police service and the proposals contained, particularly in the Police bill, will not be fully implemented in the way that they're currently proposed on the white paper today. Could I point out to members that we did have er written replies to try and speed up the question process, could I ask members both in asking the question and especially in answering, not to make it another speech occasion because otherwise it destroys the whole purpose of having the written replies. Please try and keep questions and answers to the point please, thank you. Did you wish Mr to raise your, on the, in that, that concludes you does it Mr ? Okay. Mr you have a question. Chairman, yes. Thank you very much,yes point taken but a vitally important issue and I'm very grateful once again that you have allowed this as an emergency question erm. My supplementary is will the Chairman of policy and resources committee make a statement to the county council to reassure and inform the ethnic minority community and the general public of Leicestershire of the need for tolerance and racial harmony and reaffirm the county council's opposition to all forms of racist dogma. Can I further ask will he join me to congratulate the Chief Constable in an unprecedented move in which he actually formed links and created a an environment of partnership as recently highlighted in the Leicester Mercury. Thank you. Mr Thank you Mr Chairman, thank you Mr . If it is not an emergency question, you are in time Mr with your question, in case anyone thinks that it was an emergency question was put down It wasn't an emergency question. It was not. No it was, it was in the time limit. I must say in that sense, thank you Mr for your question, because it's an an issue that's conc should concern every member of this authority. I would like the members of this authority to to have a look at the reply I make no apology for the length of the reply to Mr 's very important question. On erm what you have asked for Mr . I must say that I am happy to make that statement and in view of some of the things that have been, that have appeared in the media recently here's a statement that needs to be made as for your your your ques , what the, the Chief Constable I welcome the statement and the actions of the Chief Constable on this very concerning issue. Thank you. Mr Have you any supplementary? Yes sir, on the erm first part erm in in clarification if I might sir the erm question of er briefing the Chairman is in fact dealt with in paragraph forty seven of annex C of P P G twelve although I'm grateful for information on paragraph forty eight, erm and it says amongst other things that er there shall be a briefing and that briefing, the contents of that briefing shall be made public can I press the er spokesman for the environment committee to tell us er why in fact that wasn't done and whether he thinks there can be prop proper public debate if it isn't done. Sorry about that. Carry on Mr It is my understanding from the reply there's a fairly clear statement there that that was done erm I indeed have a copy of the principal briefing paper which the Director prepared for the panel, Chairman it outlined the background to the structure plan review, it referred to the previously approved structure plans, copies of which were appended to the briefing paper. It referred to the regional strategy which is currently out for consultation but was an emerging document and copies of that were again appended to the briefing paper it outlined the county council's procedures which were followed in progress in the structure plan it outlined a programme establishing the weight of opinion of objectors it indicated our process in preparing policy amendments to be put to the panel and all those matters were made public It also requested the panel's view on the role of county council members at the enquiry in public the responses to that were not made public and were in fact a question which was clearly put to the panel. The paper also discussed erm the proposed topics for discussion at the enquiry in public it explained where the county council's er relevant policies would be found in the extra electory memorandum it outlined the key objections and the proposed participants for each topic. The first two of those were also included were made public, they are in the issue's papers it did not make public the county council's proposal as to who should be participants for each topic since those were matters for the the panel er to to ma take a view of and I understood er from er the question er the answer to the question that it had been made clear that er the information had been made public except as always Chairman,er our legal office's of the council always like that caveat that in case anything had been missed out I had just in fact suggested that perhaps not everything had been made public so I anticipated a possible supplementary question from Mr . Thank you. That concludes the questions and answers No it doesn't sir Clarification The second question I have with your permission sir. Yeah. Erm should the erm that, given that er, sorry, that the er, er O P C S in fact erm er after every census makes er guesses about its accuracy erm would erm the spokesman, is the spokesman aware that in fact O P C S has said that a fair erm representation of the intercensal increase in population in Leicestershire er between nineteen eighty one and nineteen ninety one is in fact fifteen thousand people and doesn't he feel that to provide for fifty three thousand in the structure plan is a little over the top? Mr Mr makes there was an under, enumeration of figures and that has been made clear in the reply the reply is quite clear about the basis on which the structure plan is being promulgated and the total projected total population in two thousand and six regards the historical data, that should be taken, as far as I'm concerned, as matters of fact, will of course not be absolutely accurate and as far as projected data is concerned all that we can do any of us can do is to try and make the best estimates possible and I am satisfied that our officers will have done that. I hope I've understood the supplementary question correctly, if I've not I apologise to Mr but we are dealing in a technical area. Thank you. I have decided to exercise my discretion under standing order five so that agenda item nine B, notice of motion by Mr on fox-hunting to be taken now. In addition to the many personal representation made to members of the council on the subject of fox hunting on county council land, the county secretary has now received a total of two hundred and six written representations nearly as many as me. Of these a hundred and sixty eight contain expressions of opposition to fox hunting and thirty eight contain either expressions of support for fox hunting or that the county council should not be considering the matter for one reason or another. I have also had passed to me a petition from Mr containing four thousand five hundred signatures from the national anti-hunt petition er, there is a doubt of the petition or a letter from the tenant farmers but er, there is representation from them. Erm, Mr would you move the motion please. Thank you Chair, erm In moving the motion this time I'm not going to be very passionate like I normally am on on subjects in this council chamber I'm I'm actually gonna try and keep, I'm actually going to try and keep politics down to a low level and er because I believe there conscience on all sides of this chamber. We have not got a monopoly on conscience I know that certain Liberals have debated this subject and as th the passions been raised in their group meetings. I know also that some Conservatives that feel that perhaps what I've laid before you this afternoon has some credence. The reason I did this, because some sixteen months ago, like over a year ago we brought it and lost it, it wasn't a victory for anybody or er or er a real loss for anyone because it was lost by one vote. By wrecking a motion at the time,rightly or wrongly placed and once again I see this afternoon we've got a similar motion on the table. What I want to do though is is kind of thank a few people for start off. anti-hunt people, the League of Cruel Sports and all sorts of other organisations that have actually asked their members not to be here today, not to cause a problem, not to divert attention from the real issues in the debate er er and cause a crisis outside for all the press and the media to latch on to, that's not what they were about. I respect the fact the Hunt are here, er I respect the fact the literature that they've sent us, from all sides of the fence, from the League Against Cruel Sports, the hunting fraternity, it's been very helpful. It hasn't changed my view. I also want to put right it, er the facts that have been presented to me, that it's an urban erm view, it's city people making a er, their will, imposing their will on country folk, on the practices of country folk. I am not a city person and have never lived in a city in my life I represent a rural area, a hunting area, a hunting area erm I believe the terrier men from the some of them live in my area. I can tell you this the general public have sent me literally hundreds of cards I have had well wishing cards, I've also had some letters from the opposition, some of them, to be quite honest, have been disgraceful. Some of them have asked me about my parentage, some of them have asked me whether or not I am tinkering with the laws of God. I will extract those to one side and say they not really followers of the hunt, they are probably some weird faction that latch onto these type of things during erm these issues. It's a shame also that we have to fill the council chamber on such a debate. It's a pity that the general public don't come into this chamber on, on a normal debate, about education, about children's needs, about social services, the very things that I've Here, here, been attacked over the last few months of not wasting time on the hunt I spend an awful lot of time relieving heavy goods traffic in my area, concerned totally about the environment, about mineral extraction quarries, mining, open cast, things of that calibre. This is one debate, one small debate, hopefully put to bed within an hour with a decent result. The motion itself is a compromise some on my side have said it's too much of a compromise they've said you're tr trying to be all things to all people. What I have done is hopefully brought together a er a view of people, a clash of personalities and a way forward. I want to answer the questions on jobs. Those jobs can be protected, I know the hunting fraternity say they don't want to drag hunt. We set standards, standards evolve we are coming to the stage now in nineteen ninety three the standards that are being set are changing and at the end of the day the hunt have got to come along with us. The gauntlet was down, the opportunity to talk to arrange a forum, to come together, land owners, local authorities, the hunt's people, er the interested parties, to come together and look for a decent way of hunting and that way is probably drag hunting and we're giving you a golden opportunity to start that route. It's gotta start somewhere, there's a motion, a tide of feeling going across the country on council from council, it won't be long before people like me are M P's and others around you that are M P's are in the and fellow members that will be down in Whitehall and eventually will put you to bed, if you bury your head in the sand and at the end of the day I'm afraid the country is going to knock it off. The general public are saying no. Time has come for a change. I want to thank also er the different organisations, cos you made an absolute profit for the G P O, er erm British Telecom, they must have actually made a bomb in Leicestershire over the last few days. I thank the League Against Cruel Sports for their literature. Very, very informative. I also thank the hunting fraternity for their documentary they sent me on hunting the facts. But I would like to point out in this video, and on the brochure that goes with it, actually says the rest of the field are there to follow on horseback or on foot or by car, very few people indeed actually witness the death of a fox. The followers are there for a day out in the countryside, the opportunity to ride or to walk freely over private property with the consent of the landowner. I agree, sometimes I can tell you I have witnessed a hunt and on a cold, frosty morning when er about forty or fifty horses are thundering across the ploughed field, it's enough to p the power of that sight is enough to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up that's not what we are against the hunter that came to me and says Eh up lad, I won't go drag hunting because I'm sixty years old, I've done it all my life and I like the ride, I like to be there I never see a fox killed that's fact, it's in the video. So why is it important that the kill has to continue. You can continue your sport the decent side of the sport without the need for the kill and and we will encourage, my motion actually encourages that, encourages the fox hunting fraternity to look at a way forward, come forward, talk to us. If you're willing to go down the route to drag hunting I am willing to support any hunt that wants to go down that route and I am sure this authority would. We can negotiate access to our land and we will be only too pleased to do so but whilst you are killing the fox er and at the end of the day, it is not on. I've also said to certain factions of the er direct action groups this is the unacceptable face of protest. Let's put that side of the protest to bed. If you change now, Leicestershire has a golden opportunity, we are proud of the fox, we are proud of the fox in Leicestershire, our football team, the Foxes,our, our fox cubs our Police emblem, it isn't the hunters, we don't support the hunters at Leicester's Street, we support the foxes and at the end of the day I think there is room for the hunting fraternity to stay as part of the pageantry in Leicestershire. When we get to the jobs erm side of it the jobs I I I'm accused outside this afternoon of of putting in jeopardy one thousand something jobs erm, this authority got rid of seven hundred jobs, education jobs er only a few months ago and there's many more, something on the region of two thousand jobs will be lost in this authority without a protest. without protest from a parent, without a protest from a hunter without a protest from er a anyone else, that is a shame, because I tell you what, if you go drag hunting, you can keep the jobs the people are still going to have to shoe the horses traders and people like that are still going to have to produce the carriages to take the horses with them and the only people job jobs are in jeopardy are not the kennel staff it's the terrier men and to be quite honest, ladies and gentlemen, it's the terrier men who have actually ruined your sport, cos of what they get up to in nineteen ninety three is a disgust and at the end of the day your P R has been absolutely wrong and I hope this afternoon that Conservatives and Liberals can join with us and I've got to thank a certain Liberal because he's he's put his head on the block on several occasions on this when we stood on the platform as individuals, not as politicians, as individuals on this and I think that this afternoon we've got a way forward, we can say to the hunt, come and talk you change, we'll give you access. Thank you Chair. Have we a seconder. No. Thank you. Did you wish to move an amendment? Thank you sir. Can I erm,er move the amendment that is in my name. This is fact is a debate about personal freedom the freedom of our tenants to choose the quite legal activities that take place on their farms for whatever we may think about the merits and de-merits of angling or shooting fox hunting, these are activities that Parliament has decided are permissible. Chairman, I believe that this is just the sort of motion that can only bring local government into disrepute It's an abuse of power the council holds lands in the county farms estate for purposes set out in the nineteen sixty agriculture act. It doesn't hold land in order to allow ideologues to impose their views on our tenants and impose it through a form of nineteenth century landlordism. If Mr doesn't like field sports he should seek, try to seek to persuade Parliament to ban it he'll have an excellent opportunity because he'll, he's told us that he'll be an MP shortly that's what's happening, that's what's happened in the case of cock fighting and badger baiting it hasn't happened in the case of fox hunting and Mr shouldn't abuse his position as a councillor to dictate to the council's tenants in the way that he proposes. Here, here. As well as being the sort of motion that brings local government into disrepute, I also believe that this is the sort of motion that, that displays a lack of tolerance that should concern us all. This county council has recognised that in Leicestershire we live in a society. Labour members have been at the forefront in demanding that ethnic communities be free to keep their traditions and cultures yet here we are Labour members trying to prevent countrymen pursuing traditional country sports that have been followed by our forefathers for centuries. I cannot see the consistency. Must be your forefathers, not mine. Yes,w well you said it And I think we are entitled to ask Mr whether he has actually asked the tenants for their views. Yes. yes Has he asked them how this initiative could affect their livelihood. Yes. Does he even care. Yes, he does. And what did they say, I can tell you what they said, because I happen to have a petition here, signed by a hundred and four county council tenants out of the hundred and six that we have. Oh well done. And I will read it as farm tenants of Leicestershire county council we wish to retain the freedom to make the decision ourselves as to whether fox hunting with hounds takes place on our land. We do not consider drag hunting to be an alternative. Well done. At our last meeting we discussed the running of a community centre in the middle of Leicester. We'll be discussing it this afternoon and Labour members told us and no doubt they'll tell us again that the users of the centre have a democratic right to be consulted about how it was run Don't tenant farmers have the right to be consulted? Where are their democratic rights Is this the new, I quote, the new era of democratic rights about which was talking yesterday? One man, one vote. Chairman. This is a vindictive and intolerant motion it sets an unfortunate precedent and in this debate about freedom we should support the rights of our tenants to choose. Have we a seconder. Served by Right, at present I have fifteen speakers, plus the two seconders who have reserved the, their right. We start off with Mr . Thank you Chairman. I rise to support the motion moved in Mr name and I have always been opposed to fox hunting full stop. Hunting and all cruel sports which are totally anachronistic in present day society. But I wish to relate to the council a particular episode, which I hope will convey something to those people who are perhaps still wavering erm, and whilst we all have principle stands on issues it behoves us as members to consider the views of our constituents and the sorts of things that take place in our wards. And I remind this council of something I said a few years ago of an incident, incident concerning the Atherstone hunt in my ward where the hounds attacked the dogs of, a couple of dogs of a constituent of mine in his back garden totally uncontrolled, they were running amuck right across land in Ellistown this is nothing the hunt could do nothing the hunt tried to do they were too busy off still dashing ahead chasing the fox or what they thought was a fox. Meanwhile the owner the person who lived a small terraced property, whose garden backs onto the fields tried to get the hounds several dozen hounds off these two dogs who were being savaged to death and he had a heart attack in the process, Chairman and was hospitalized for several weeks That Chairman is the effect of the hunt on one of my constituents whose job it is for me to defend the rights that I was elected here to defend the rights of my constituents, not to be harassed in this manner. Of course he was released from hospital and he recovered and of course we we, he, we protested to the hunt and they had the audacity to off to offer him some fifty pounds compensation, which was a adding insult to injury. So that's how I can speak from direct experience. I'd also like to say that I've received some twenty nine representations from constituents in my ward all of whom live in my ward who are opposed to fox hunting and have asked me today to vote to ban fox hunting on our land and I've only received two representations from official bodies the video and, and a representation from the British Field Sports Association erm, in favour of fox hunting. So I think it's time that er we dragged this county council into this century and not into the century, or the centuries of Mr 's forefathers. And that we actually op adopted a b a modern sensible er, reasonable attitude towards all living creatures and that we do today vote to ban fox hunting it is anachronistic as I said earlier, it is not necessary it actually causes harm, not only does it cause harm to foxes, but at least in one case, which is sufficient for me to continue my support for the ban damage to the people in my area. I don't want to rehearse the arguments, I'm sure other members will put all the other arguments about cruelty, about the destruction of land and so on. But I'll finish Chairman, by saying that also I've received complaints from er, a tenant farmer, not one of our tenant farmers, but a p a person who farms who actually has problems because of the pressure that that farmer is under to allow the hunt to go across their land because they're surrounded by by farmers who do allow them. They don't wish it to happen, but it becomes an impossibility almost for them to stand up to their rights, and Mr talks about rights and no rights is in abstract and we all know how difficult it is then to stand up as a minority when you're surrounded by that majority, but I've had personal representations They have the right to choose. From them. They do not have the right to choose because they, they virtually, the the hunt has always ignored their wishes. They have to buy and sell their produce in that community and there are restrictions operating on that. So I think we must today level out the rules on this and we must speak for what is the majority of opinion in this country, by every single opinion poll that's been conducted, and that is Chairman to vote to ban fox hunting on our land. Thank you. Thank you Mr . Mr . Thank you Chairman. Er, Mr said this is a debate about personal freedom. Actually it is a debate about personal conscience Last night I had one of those phone calls that we've all been getting erm the guy on the other end apologised for not being one of my constituents erm, I said it probably wasn't his fault. He went on to said he wanted to talk about the hunting debate, erm, it occurred to me to wonder why they couldn't find anyone in Stonygate in favour of hunting, I mean perhaps there aren't any people in Stonygate in favour of hunting. I certainly have not received any communication from any individual in my ward in favour of hunting. I've received a number against. He asked me whether I was a country person I asked what the qualifications were he said country born and bred, well I was born in Liverpool spent my childhood and early adolescence in rural Nottinghamshire, moved to Highfields, emigrated to the West Indies and now live in sub rural Blavey so I don't know whether I qualify as a country person or not, but I'd like to bet that I've milked more cows by hand than he has if that's any qualification. The conversation ranged widely through wildlife management, the history of the landscape and of hunting and he was on very shaky ground there I can tell you control of pests, he likened a farmer killing a rat with a dog, to the whole panoply of fox hunting. As this conversation continued over an extended period, I was waiting to go out to dinner, erm it became apparent that he hadn't understood my position it was apparent again, outside earlier today, that people do not understand the position that people like me take. I tried to make it clear at an early stage my petition is a simple, straightforward one not involved with wildlife management,history or anything else like that, I simply believe that killing animals for fun is morally wrong. Last Saturday night Channel four show showed Sex, lies and videotape well, we got the lies and the video tape, I'd like to know what happened to the sex. People keep writing letters to the Mercury saying how can we afford to spend time and money debating this, well they can afford the time and the money employing out of work newsreaders to produce videos and writers and photographers to produce their glossy magazines, their glossy leaflets I didn't need the R S P C A or the League to tell me that er, the fox photo, this fox photo was a fake, I mean that's obvious to anybody I didn't need them to tell me that the video was suspect, that too is obvious. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this video tape is the involvement of loony er, who's espoused every cause known to human kind. Whether they had any merit or not. Most recent of course, is euthanasia it doesn't draw the line at killing foxes I had this terrible vision in the early hours this morning,of Ron closing all our elderly persons' homes, pushing all the old people out onto the street and the hunt with at its head hunting them down the countryside. Look, it's alright to have a bit of fun with this, but the matter is deadly serious and I use the word deadly advisedly. What it comes down to is do we, or do we not approve of killing animals for fun do we approve of allowing a pack of dogs to hunt an animal to its death. If the answer's no we do not approve then it's up to us, the onus is on us to do whatever we can, wherever we have any control to prevent it happening. Let us today do what our consciences demand and vote to stop this cruelty in just one small corner of this county. Mr Thank you Chair. I will be voting for the motion and I will be voting against the amendment. I'd like to start before I explain that, just to refer to a few comments that Mr made. Mr made a comment about Moats and Highfield. I find this a little strange since he was quite happy to support us when my colleague and I said that there was a greater good to be considered and that people had issues that had to be raised in that area above and beyond the local community. So we did suggest and I did believe your party to support erm, a process where we did consult with local people but we also took other factors into consideration. So I hope today you will take wider factors into consideration as well. The other one, the other one that I find interesting is I hope Mr will take his comments back to John , because John 's quite happy, I applaud him for once, it's about the only thing I do applaud John for,erm, but John 's quite happy to turn round to Norway and say forget your centuries old traditions of killing whales. Killing whales is not a thing that you should go round doing and and yet John 's quite happy to do that and I support John in in that approach. I'd like to address the reasons why I will be voting for this motion today. It's often put that hunting is good for the countryside that it's about controlling foxes the scientific evidence rather puts that to pay the scientific evidence certainly indicates that fox hunting makes very little difference to control of foxes in the countryside and there is some evidence to suggest that fox hunting actually encourages more foxes to breed and that we end up with more foxes, so it seems to be self defeating in that respect. There is of course the argument about the maintenance of the countryside and that the countryside only looks the way it does, because of the fox hunting. I think there are a lot of other factors that affect the countryside as we all well know. The way we farm. The nature of erm, subsidies from Europe and all others, other factors. I think this argument's about the benefit of the countryside is somewhat debatable to say the least And these arguments that are put about why we shouldn't ban fox hunts because of all the benefits and the tradition are exactly the same arguments that were put about otters and about badgers and about other sports that we have, that we no longer consider satisfactory and have opposed. From my point of view, one of the most powerful arguments that needs to be addressed is the argument about individual freedom and this is always important to me about, if you're going to take an action that limits somebody's freedom, you damn well have to have a good reason for it. There is no legislation to ban fox hunting yet. I'm quite sure that it will not be long before we see that happen. What we do have and have had for a long time in this country is an acceptance within our law and an acceptance within our definitions of freedom that there are responsibilities with freedom and those responsibilities in this particular case, we have long accepted the argument in this country, maybe not as much as erm, well more in fact than some of our colleagues abroad and maybe they could learn from us from this, but it is not acceptable to have the freedom to be unnecessarily cruel and in fox hunting we have a sport that is unnecessarily cruel, there are ways in which you can deal with rogue foxes, there are ways in which you can actually ensure that the fox community does not destroy the whole, er farming countryside. But fox hunting doesn't address that. Fox hunting falls purely and simply on the side of unnecessary cruelty. Freedom, because there is not the freedom here. I might suggest the other point, now I actually represent a city ward so I'm sure I'll hear the baying of the hounds that say why am I getting up and speaking. Well actually people in my area do have a concern about this, also though I was brought up in my teens at least within a rural area and I know full well that to hold certain views even those of the majority within rural areas, are not necessarily easily expressed and I have today been told of yet another example of this being the case. Where somebody goes to a public meeting and doesn't say Near time. anything but just listens and what happens, what happens to that, the vets that person's husband's livelihood is threatened, why are they threatened? They are threatened because the hunt turns round and uses its power over its tenants to force people to withdraw their, their. Time. Thank you. Thank you. When. I, I said near time, I advising people it's nearly time, when it is time they will most certainly know and emphatically it's time. So when the first warning, it's near time. Thank you. Next speaker Mr . Thank you Chairman. Erm, I want to er support er the amendment moved by er, erm, Mr and er erm I want to oppose the motion erm since people are tending to describe their, their background in respect of fox hunting. May I say that er, I've lived for nearly thirty years er, in Oakham which is in the er, in the centre of er fox hunting country. I've er, thank you, I've never seen a fox hunt erm I've er I think once er, once I got along to Cutts Close where the Boxing Day meet occurs and I can well accept that this Boxing Day meet draws a larger crowd of people from Oakham than any other activity through the year. So I don't speak really as a committed fox hunt or anti fox hunter er I speak erm,after a consideration of the matter er that that what have at issue here is er, the, the right of the tenant. If a man is paying his rent to his landlord he surely has the right to use er the land he is paying for and in the, in that matter of using it, surely is included the, the sporting right. erm. Hunting, let me remind those on the other side here, is still a lawful activity it's no good saying, ah, well Parliament's gonna pass an act against it soon. It may well pass an act against it soon, it may well be that a lot of people from over there will get elected and you'll get your bill, but then again it may not. Yes, yes Surely, in this country we have to obey the laws that are there, not the laws that are going some day to be passed. Sunday trading Tenants have, let me, let's stick with the motion shall we. The tenant has surely a right to carry out this lawful activity. Drag hunting's been mentioned from the tenant's point of view er, drag hunting doesn't control the fox and one of the reasons why the er, tenant er, allows fox hunting is that the, the fox is controlled by it. It's er,surely wishful thinking to assume that sweep away fox hunting, they're all gonna go drag hunting and all those jobs'll be saved. That's a fairly tenuous er sort of platform to get rid of those er hunting jobs and I'd've thought that er, a party whose leader Mr saw him, was it yesterday?,proclaiming the importance of er protecting employment and combating unemployment. Well surely some of that might filter down to this chamber. Let's not take chances er unnecessarily with the right, er wi with the e employment er of those in, in the hunting industry as it were. I don't think er Chairman, this, this county council is, is competent to do away with hunting. That, that I, I say is reserved for Parliament. er,Can I enter a plea for tolerance, if in a democracy it's very easy to get steamed up about things you don't like, things you find disgusting and revolting but if everyone is going to come forward, have banned the activity they don't like then we're going to live, it may be a democracy, but it's going to be a narrowed, er and intolerant society in which we live. Finally er, Chairman. My history books told me about those wicked aristocrats of the nineteenth century, they used their position as landlords to force their tenants to, to vote in a certain way, to force their tenants in other words to take up a particular position on a matter of controversy. Near time. I'm interested, thank you, I'm interested to notice that this nineteenth century attitude is being repeated now by er, our friends over there in the Labour party, erm and I must say, that really confirm what I've always thought that a lot of their attitudes and their mental furniture do in fact belong to that century. Er, Chairman I'd like to er, erm, oppose the motion and support the amendment. Here, here. Mr Thank you Chair. I would like to support the motion put in the name of Mr and I would like to speak against the amendment. I've heard what's Mr has to say. It was good. Yes, very good. You may think it's a fun having a blood game on your hand, you may think that your class used to also enjoy slavery two hundred years ago. Here, here, Listen, listen so you may have a right to defend at any cost which you think is privileged society the fact of the matter is people out there I received twenty seven letters in support against the fox hunting I did not receive a single letter asking me to support the fox hunting. Always against fox hunting, why is that? And it wasn't even from my constituency it was widely from the Leicestershire and coming back to our, our friend there Doctor er , I don't know what was the name there when he mentioned about what's the name? It it's er really put me off the track there, I'm sorry I. You're losing time. I was coming back to the fox hunting here, when it's mentioned sorry about that Chair. Men ,men , mentioned here by our friend, that Leicestershire has got no business to discuss about fox hunting, we are not elusive, there are other county councils who have banned fox hunting on their land, so do not make this as a sacrosanct and or something that Leicestershire are doing, they are not doing first, there are so many other county councils in this country and for your information, I was listening to radio four few days ago, even in Pakistan, a third world country, is banning hunting in their country, we should be ashamed of ourselves here to discuss, I agree with Councillor when the discussion start and he said move for the ward, because the logical thing was to move for the wards rather than discuss, if we all believe that this is horrible, acrimonious and abhorrent in today's day and age, as the slavery was abhorred two hundred years ago. So I move that we support the motion and speak against amendment. Thank you. Mr Thank you er . Can I first of all congratulate my colleague Graham, Graham on his measured speech, he's certainly given us many things to, to think about and things that should be investigated. Can I also say really I agree with Martin when he said erm, and has been saying for at least six months that surely we have more important things to, to talk about than, than this and I'm sorry for Martin that he had to erm, give in really and put this I was the movement of the amendment in January ninety two erm,which confirmed that the rights of tenants and old occupiers of land in county council ownership to er allow or stop fox hunting over land in their care. That was successful there er, er on that occasion and er of course I hope it, it will be successful again this afternoon. At that time, we, we received a petition from the tenants erm very much along the lines of the one that erm erm, er Mr has read out, at that time there was a petition from a hundred and eight county council tenants and one hundred and five of them in fact signed it and they, they asked for it to be allowed to keep the erm to have the freedom to decide whether or not hunting takes place. I think erm it is worth saying Chairman, it hasn't been mentioned yet, er that in fact we're talking about the the tenant farmers and their livelihood. Most of the tenant farmers i in this county I believe are dairy farmers and in fact they have their life savings tied up in their stock. They, they know what they have to do to protect that stock, to protect their life's interests and they, and they know they don't need to be told really by any officer here who are not in that not, not in that game, what they have to do that's what they're asking us to do and they certainly asked us to do that on the erm, on the tour of county farms that we had only, only a few weeks ago. I think it's also worth just bearing in mind that we're talking about only one percent of the erm of the farmed land i in this county, we're not talking about banning hunting in in er in Leicestershire,we're talking about what we're saying on one percent there are tens of thousand of fields in in this county nothing can change overnight, even if this er motion goes through because the tenants will still have the rights to decide, it's only when you actually start getting to new tenancy agreements that you will be in a position if you wish,to start to change things and therefore I suppose at the end of erm, at the end of five years you might have a hundred or two hundred fields on which this ban will apply but you will still have tens of thousand of fields on which the, the hunt will still be, the hunts in this county will still be free to, erm, to operate. I think we have to try and keep this in in proportion, we are really into a we are really into a gesture here an important gesture possibly, but nothing is going to change overnight and in fact very little will happen erm, for years, for years to come. I, I, do not understand Chairman that reading this motion, I've been trying to think about it, how on earth this is going to be monitored. How on earth are you going to how on earth are you going to put a a sign on certain fields that the hunt shall not pass? Are you going to say hunters will be prosecuted or something? Or are you going to electrify the, these fields? Are you going to have mounted policemen following the hunt round to ensure that they only steer their course along certain ways? Are you going to have stationary policemen guarding fields to ensure that only the fox can enter and not the, and not the hounds? Are you going to have countywide monitoring? Are we going to have er, erm, are we going to have some kind of reporting system, so that if a hunt actually enters erm, one of our fields, we're going to start denouncing tenants and have them hauled up in front of a disciplinary committee?. There are all kinds of questions that this matter raises in my mind which haven't been addressed. I only repeat what I said last time Chairman that if the, that if people do not understand the management of the countryside, that they leave it well alone. Here, here. Mr . Thank you Mr Chairman. In all probability not a single fox will live or die as a consequence of any vote we take this afternoon. As Mr pointed out in outline,our county estate of some eight thousand acres of which only three quarters or roughly six thousand acres is suitable for hunting, is less than one percent of the county's acreage of six hundred and fifty thousand. If hunting were banned on all of that it would only have a small marginal effect but we can as Mr said only ban hunting on land we both own and control, land in hand, that actually totals a hundred and fifty eight acres, slightly smaller than Victoria Park but that includes road, bridleways, land with no access, S S S Is, Sites of Special Scientific Interest, land awaiting disposal the land capable of being hunted and in hand totals fifty two acres about as much of Victoria Park as I can see from my front window. If you have the country parks and already there is no hunting on those parts open to the public there's just about another hundred acres, that's the Victoria Park or thereabouts in total. But that's not the end of it the Director of Property has very kindly plotted where this land is and I will show you the plan, the yellow spots are the land in hand. If the map of Leicestershire were a face it would have a few small pimples on its chin and they would take fifty years to come to a head. If you draw a line from Loughborough down the A six, through the city of Leicester and on to Market Harborough to the east of that line, in that part of the county where most of the hunting takes place, there is one small piece of land, less than one acre, somewhere near Thorpe Satchfield which we actually control. As I said, it would take fifty years before any decision we reach here, even made an impression on the one percent of land we do own. So, those who do not support hunting will do nothing practical to protect foxes, if they vote for this motion today in that respect it is and I suggest the people who move it know that it is, nothing but sanctimonious twaddle. They would be voting to divert attention from the one place where the merits or otherwise of fox hunting should be decided and considered amongst M Ps, you will note amongst MPs not by government, this is a matter for a free vote of conscience. About the only decent argument I've heard on this, I have to say that because it was my daughter who advanced it, about the only decent argument I have heard is the one about badger baiting where she said to me but badger baiting is not allowed on your land and that is the point precisely that Mr made, it is not allowed because that is the law of the land and that is where decisions about the permission or otherwise of fox hunting should be made. This is an issue of individual conscience of M Ps. Whatever is happening elsewhere there is not today, there is no one man one, one man one vote here. We can all watch for the Labour block vote at the end of this debate as a matter of principle, I could never vote in support of the Labour whip. So this debate is not about saving foxes, it will achieve nothing for animal welfare it is not about the merits or otherwise of fox hunting, from which it diverts attention, it is about the county council seeking to make hollow gestures against their tenants' rights. Gestures which are not within the normal scope of the private landlord, gestures of a political kind that could be a dangerous precedence for other political and possibly improper objectives in the future. That is why I will support the amendment and if that fails Near time. I shall play no further part in this debate which should not be taking place. It can have no practical effect and will only divert attention from where it should be pressed by those who feel strongly about it. I do hope Mr Chairman that those members who oppose fox hunting will feel that they should do the same. Thank you. Mr . Thank you Chair. Erm first of all I would like to make the point that er it's typical of our friends over this side to arrange an ethic dimension when they were er opposing their amendment, it confuses the issue, it is racist and shouldn't occur. As a Labour councillor of a rural part of Leicestershire, a very beautiful po part of rural Leicestershire erm I've taken a straw poll amongst my farming friends and er when I talk about fox hunting they er roll and shrug their shoulders, there's no problem and if fox hunting is er part of the culling process, they don't have a problem. They don't have a problem at all it doesn't seem to er be part of their daily lives er, that said I do have a farmer of my acquaintance, when I say my acquaintance he happens to be my son-in-law. He er, is a sheep farmer and er, two or three years ago the Atherstone passed through his land and er ran amuck amongst his flock and he lost actually three in lamb ewes who drowned in a local river. At the same time the hunt passed further on and his wife, my daughter,er had two horses which bolted in a field and leapt the farm gate and er, took off and were caught two miles away. That's the other side of fox hunting, which I think we don't hear. When they complained to the hunt er, the Master brought er a leg of pork round, not a leg of lamb I might add, a leg of pork to er, appease them er one other point, ooh yeah, there was, is one other point actually, when my daughter challenged the hunt she was appalled by the arrogance of these pink coated hooray Henrys who totally ignored her plight and er just carried on with whatever they wished to do. One other point Mr Chair, if I could crave your indulgence you will er, I think you all know that Leicester City Football Club are playing this evening at Middlesbrough. I hope you'll soon be done. and that, that, as a result of that we could be, Leicester City could be at the top of the first division, I know the Chairman follows the Philbert Street Foxes, I would hope that this chamber will support the Leicestershire foxes when it's time to take our vote. Thank you. Mr . Er, Mr Chairman, I'd like to make some observations. I'd like to make the observations because I'm of the opinion that most members came into this chamber this afternoon with their minds completely and utterly made up and there is very little that we can do in this chamber this afternoon to change people's minds. So they are observations and it is my feeling that this motion has taken on significantly more importance than its content or indeed its effect. I only wish and I mean this very sincerely I only wish we could spend as much time and as often as is spent discussing fox hunting on the county's homeless, on abused children, on the handicapped, on the increasing crime and on unemployment and I only wish that the media and the public and even members of this council would take as much notice of that as they do about this debate on fox hunting. I am also concerned that after this debate there will be no winners not even the fox, for it will be killed it will be killed in some way or another and the feelings that are left between the two differing sides will harbour grudges and resentment for many months to come and I'd like to also bearing in mind the comments that were made by Councillor ask how committed the people who have proposed this mo motion are against barbaric sport. I regard barbaric sport, not only perhaps as fox hunting but also such things as boxing, where two people, two individuals do their best to hit the life out of the other and it is watched by thousands of people. Now the Labour party control the city council, may I say this, that if your feelings are against barbaric sport as much as that, why don't you use your contr , your controlling power on the city council and then ban boxing in all the city establishments, then you will show me that you mean what you are saying and that you are not just using the present position of this council for a political measure and political gain and I'd like to also ask what this has cost the council what this has cost could be thousands. The very meeting itself is thousands of pounds, the time we have spent on it is thousands of pounds. Many times in this council when we've been discussing more important points, when we've been discussing the needs of people who have real needs, we have not been able to have our priority we have not been able to have our priority because we could not afford two? , enough for two there. Well er, mine's . Well there's not enough for two to go round so I was . Sit up and stop bloody that! Sit up there! Ah! Pull the chair out! Can I have some beans now? Yes, it's being done just now.

Go in and get your face wiped! Dad? Yeah? The top of the tape by that Walkman's erm on top of those two china plates. Is it? So that ewes er, are, are, er, erm, protected by him, erm in Leicestershire he says it's open countryside and he says I don't lose that many by foxes, he says I'm more, er er at unease with other things. Getting to the tenant situation I have never dictated to tenants. In actual fact I have bent over backwards, I was the only councillor that went and welcomed one of our new ke tenant farmers quite recently, having been on the agricultural environment protection committee and been on a board of er interview panel. I actually asked prospective farmers what they thought about certain issues, because I think the Leicestershire county council er and our department are probably some of the best farmers landlords there are in the country and I think our tenant farmers know that in actual fact I asked the question to several of the members er er the potential er clients erm, what do you think about foxes. At no time did I ever have one of them ever say to me that they were erm against foxes, but all of a sudden we find ourselves being issued with a er petition from tenant farmers which says that they are against er people like me that er er pro banning, it's very like er Mr , we can't attack Mr cos he's no longer here but on the, on the issue of er , I C I brought ou . I said to the farmers we s you should cut grass and you get nitrates into the water and I said to the farmers er er about their slurry throwing erm a muck across the land, we know the problems that causes, I said if we came out with fertilisers which were would you buy them if it costed a bit more. Ninety percent of them said yes, that it depends on how you present the figures, so in actual fact I wonder how our tenant farmers all of a sudden find themselves in a position that they perhaps would rather sign a petition and not put their heads above the parapet bearing in mind you are in a community, bear in mind you are connected, bear in mind that your livelihood is with those others and I have to say it is true that a certain business in my area connected with farming has been threatened. That the hunting fraternity have passed the word round that it to remove your business because it's rumoured that that person is involved with er er people like me. I think that's that absolutely horrific and that has come from one of the practice partners and not the actual himself. I think that's terrible. To put that type of pressure on individuals I think is absolutely awful. Going on again on the tenant farmers, I actually think that er we are very good landlords and I think our our our tenants would rather us keep us as landlords than the private sector, in actual fact we will have no doubt a debate quite soon on that issue when the government makes us sell off all areas of of er th our interests and that one, I will tell you this, I think that some of the members all sides of the fence every side of the fence, have been passionately behind the tenants, if if they're gonna be sold off by now they'd have been sold off, but I think it won't be far long before we have to take education first, social services first, the elderly before er your side with your government to come forward and say to us we don't want you interfering with anything like that and being bold business, get rid of, but that's another debate that will come up later on. Monitoring. I trust our tenants at the end of the day if it is illegal I'm sure that our tenants will not do it. When it becomes illegal which will I'm sure all people will abide by the law. I'm sorry about the turning a blind eye I er I er Mr I really do feel that if you are passionate about it the one way to get rid of this debate is to vote for my motion. Because there is a way forward, it is about negotiation, it is about hunt the hunting community, it is about sharing ideas and looking for a way forward, going forward from here, well to turn a blind eye to what goes on and vote for that amendment is very similar to what Hitler did in Germany fifty years ago. The national populous actually turned a blind eye to atrocities that were happening with human beings. It didn't just start off with human beings, they s started in sectors and it spread. I don't think it's as bad as that here but I don't think it can ever happen here, hopefully. But on the same score I'm afraid I must be an a narrow minded urban socialist well okay, I've never lived in a city but if you want to call me that, fine. But what I do say is I am a trustee I am a trustee not of farmer's land not of your land Mr , not of your land Mr not of your land Mr every person in Leicestershire owns that land, they have got a mark and I'll tell you sir four thousand five hundred signatures made in one weekend are saying to us you are a trustee of our land, it's not your land, our land I keep hearing, it's our land it's not our land it's the people of Leicestershire's land and what the people of Leicestershire land are saying to us sir, they're saying to us you cannot continue this barbaric killing of foxes. If it's a pest, cull it properly, get the authorities in, we've got more and more specialists sitting in those chambers telling us what to do on farming issues,on B S E, we've got coming, we've got a a team of experts, well not one of them has told said gone down in favour of hunting. Some of them have actually turned round and said keep it up Mr , keep it up Mr , we will see the end of it one day. Not all of them I accept and they've been very helpful and when it comes to erm any other issue, I think basically, unfortunately sir, I think that we have strayed from the debate, we've strayed onto ethnic issues er er and I think it's a shame Mr , there was no need to introduce that and of course it was bound to bring a backlash, it was bound to introduce it it it it's coloured it it's made opaque the issues because you make it complicated, in actual fact er er I think that er being a governor of a school, I think that's absolutely marvellous that some youngsters the future, I think the future will decide, I think there are kids out there will turn round one day and say how could you have done that? How could you really have witnessed that?and when I say that finally I want to talk about terrier men because basically they're the people who've ruined your sport the terrier men are illegal, the terrier men are doing something that is definitely illegal in this country. To open a fox hole and to introduce a dog into the tunnels to come across an undefended vixen, she's bound to fight. Survival instinct is absolutely incredible, to see the wounds of a terrier and a fox when they have locked jaw locked and are pulled squealing out of a hole, I think I am deeply concerned about anybody here today that can turn that blind eye because what their terrier men are doing is dog fighting, make no bones about it, they won't be interested in laying the scent, they will not be interested in being retrained and helping your fraternity. They're there for one reason and one reason only I know, cos I've been involved in fox hunting, I've shot and fished but I'll tell you something, was also trained to hunt humans, going back many years ago, when I was in the Falkland Islands training for the event that happened eventually. One of the things that I used to do was train and I know the feeling, I know the excitement, I know the adrenalin that pumps round the body, when you go in for the kill. I know because I've actually done it. I look back now and think we are actually still doing that, not in the military aspect, in civvy street, we've got people, real nice people, you talk to them on the street and you get them at the kill and the hackles go up, you can see the adrenalin pumping round their body, you can see the kind of excitement in their eyes and you can see the terrier men grabbing by the the scruff of the neck, bleeding and then throwing. Did you watch the v video when the the terrier men having a fox fought for its life, okay to have killed it there and then I would have accepted. I could have turned a blind eye, but to grab it and to throw it to the hounds I think was absolutely abysmal. I hope today we can get rid of this issue we can put it where it belongs in the House Of Commons, we can get rid of it and make sure that Leicestershire helps that and I am still willing to talk to the hunt. I am still willing to get a forum together. I am still willing to negotiate and talk to the organisations and look at the sport. Keep the pageantry. Keep the jobs. Let's go forward together, not in not against each other Adrian,it's near time Let's go forward together. Thank you Chair for the time. Thank you for listening and I hope today that we all vote just this once and get rid of it out of our hands into the place where it belongs the House of Commons. Thank you Chair. I will now put the vote on the amendment. That's a surprise. You, you're voting on Mr amendment. Would you please indicate whether you're voting for or against or whether you are abstaining.

The result of the vote is for car is carried forty two to thirty three. Hooray We will now proceed with agenda item number six report of the policy and resources committee. Mr the agenda item number six please. After this agenda item we will take a tea break. Mr . Thank you chairman, I think that I'll take it easy until the chamber empty and so. Can you proceed Mr ? I cannot find the page now through all that excitement here when I get to it I'll get to it some time page twenty five I'll be alright. Can I say Chairman on on this report of the policy of the old policy and resources committee on the internal management of local authorities that was a very important issue because it's I all issues are important but in particular the the seal the report is to inform the council of comments which the policy and resources committee has agreed to make the association of county councils on the recommendation of the joint working party on the internal management of local authority Now I'm sure you, you've waded through the report at least some of the during the last er week or so that er that you've had it well I would advise you to turn to page thirty and thirty one because there's lot eas and it'll make life easier for you, if you do that and there on the bottom half of page thirty you will see the decisions of the policy and resources committee. I can't remember at the policy and resources why it was decided by a majority because in in replying to this report on making our comments to this report,I first had consultations with officers to go through some of the items that we had done and issues that we had covered in this authority especially the members' services sub committee and we knocked off the bare bones of er a report to the policy and resources committee and the policy. Should keep them brief. A result, I can't hear myself speaking if I are the policy and resources committee there were other they were erm er in the debate there were some very good cases brought in to it and some erm good recommendations and this is why I'm surprised I'm er forget now why, there were some who were er against by majority because I believe that when we look down on the decisions of the P N O, we have made some very good recommendations if I say so it says on twenty, paragraph twenty in and you people on this authority, members of this authority have been saying a a clear definition of the role of the local government now and for the next twenty years, should underpin any consideration of local authority management structures and the role of members and therefore the joint working party's consideration begin from an inadequate base. So what we're saying is really is that the defi definition and the role of local government should have been debated I think from starters. When then, then we could have, we could have operated amid recommendations from a a different base. On three, if you see then three that we the county council will not support a development of capital, cabinet or executive management, arrangements which would tend to concentrate power in the hands of a relatively few members stifle public debate and diminish the role of the majority of members. I think we we have quite some time on this one and I'm sure you will all agree that a reply that we do not go down the road of a cabinet government. I never, never would be a believer as was others, of a a cabinet government. I'm sure it's been operated in some places but your policy and resources committee do recommend that we do not go down that road. For as said with all three of the county councils not support the taking of new powers to promote experiment cabinet of executive management arrangements. What they've been saying is that some authorities might have experiments in the cabinet arrangement we're not advising to go down that road because and on which point we don't agree with that type of of government. And on H Little H and I'm skipping through them because I'm sure a lot of you would like to get to the tea pot. Here, here. Here, here, I second that on H on page thirty one very important one, the county council welcomes the recognition by the joint working party of the importance of meaningful support services to the elected members and the recomme recommendation that the Secretary of State should review and clarify the powers of local authorities to meet costs of services provided to members to enable them to carry out their duties as councillors Now the erm members appointments, appointments of member services sub have been discussing this issue and I would like to point out to members that we are not claiming the amount allowable for the paying members allowances we erm we're way below the limit that's allowable by the government Now before anyone say well what have you done about it? I and some others have tried to do something about it because you'll remember in the last year last two years, we have put in a a sum of money in the budget to increase the allowances for members and for resources to to support members. Not because I suppose and I must condemn any particulars group we all, in the end said not this time. But I say you're foolish not to have put that in the budget. Because it it's an essential part as of running a good authority and that is to have the resources to support the members of that authority because it is a profession, a semi professional job you sit on committees that make decisions. I think you should, allowances should be at at least support you in that and also from those allowances other resources that provide for research etcetera for the members. So I make no apology for raising this one. I will never make an apology for increase in member's allowances and resources to support members in training etcetera and the tools to do a good job, given the tools, give you the tools to do a good job. I hope I will, that we will have support in it on this issue and I don't want to take up all the time but it is something that members do approach me in, and and others on the members' services sub and I hope we have time Chairman to er give this report some consideration and let's say it's a v , it's a very important if you Chairman want any additionals to the recommendations, or if you say we're going too far in the recommendations because those recommendations you have down in front of you will be forwarded on and you're officers and your your your policies and resources they've given some time on on this report and therefore on the bottom of page thirty one the motion to be moved says that the comments of the policy and resources committee and the recommendations of the joint working party and the internal management of the local authorities be noted for submission to the Association of County Councils as appropriate. I move Seconded, reserve the right Mr Thank you Chairman. these are recommendations from a joint working party D of E of the erm local authority association and they are to almost unbelievable for us to consider and I can only assume that the that we must remember that this is really a response to what I call Heseltine's last squeeze which was the idea of executive mayors and so in a sense lip service which has to be paid somewhere along those lines but it does recommend that we think seriously about cabinet govern government about single party committees and I can't imagine how anybody in their right minds would argue now that the cabinet government when they see what cabinet government leads to in Westminster and what de facto cabinet government leads to in majority ruled councils up and down the country erm, there is of course a I think a misleading er er brownie point the idea of relaxing restrictions on members allowances but members must realise why that is in there. It's in there because you can't have executive style cabinet government in local government unless you pay executive councillors executive salaries, it's got nothing to do with the idea of you getting thirty five pounds rather than thirty three if we stay here all day erm I would just, I'm really wisely advised to make one point er Mr er was c wondering why this didn't have majority support actually most of it did I think Mr will confirm that he and his colleagues were happy to support all of the proposed responses from A to J on page thirty and thirty one but were not happy with response B and I would like to er that erm that er when our responses do go forward it is made clear that apart from little paragraph B there was all party support because I really feel that our local authority associates need to know that and erm I hope that will be little B was er a piece that erm certainly I and my colleagues supported er, rather . I mean in response to the general tone of the argument which was they want us to increase the leadership roles in the, in in local government and in in local communities and local councils we would we thought that that was inconsistent with the continual removal of the responsibilities from local government into quangos and er and er Mr and his colleagues were not happy with that. So with that er suggestion Chairman I'll, I think I'll let you all get to tea. Mr Thank you sir. Yes that's erm correct er the majority view's recommendations er did come from discussions and a large measure of agreement erm between er er all three parties on this council. Er and Professor is right that it was paragraph B er which at the time was A A er it's now B B, that caused er me and er my colleagues some difficulty erm in er policy and resources and it will be the reason for which we don't support it this afternoon. Erm er perhaps I could refer just briefly as to why not. Paragraph B suggests that er we're dealing with a report which proports to address er community leadership and representation that's not the purpose of the report. The purpose of the report is set out in erm paragraph two three of appendix one and that's on page thirty seven of the council report er which says quite clearly that things are changing in all areas of the public sector. New management styles are being developed to deal with new roles new circumstances. Local governments at the forefront of this changes. The local authority has to look not only to its traditional role as provider of services but also, this is the critical bit to one where the emphasis is now more on specifying requirements, coordinating functions, monitoring performance. The existing committee structure and many features of common practice erm as the best ways of managing service provision. It may not be so any longer and it's because this report deals with this aspect that I feel this a vital and important matter er that that in fact comes in front of us. Unfortunately erm er, the er argument has been sidetracked into a spat about whether you've got more powers or you haven't got more powers and er and other matters and er er I don't think if we're gonna get a sensible response to the D o E that we need to axe er er grind axes in that way. There's no doubt Chairman local government is changing erm the Leicestershire management initiative actually acknowledged the need to change to an enabling authority. Would that it were as easy as sticking your hand up to vote for it Because I have to say that I see no evidence since that motion approving the management initiative was passed of Labour and Liberal members doing any more than paying lip service. We've had at least two opportunities in the past two years for reorganising our own structure. We started with committee structure those attempts have foundered on intransigence over the whole nature of a review process. Even as late as last May we had the opportunity for restructuring a number of committees we flunked it. What in fact oh no. What came forward was the lowest common common denominator, the least er the least that could be agreed without any argument. It was a timid first step as to what, compared with what we ought to be doing. Well thank you indeed. If you'll allow it. Oh, you're too kind You're too kind. Now chairman. Chairman wants his tea. Chairman wants his tea not yet Mr . I do If we are going to deliver to the people to whom we as elected members owe the highest duty, that's the people who are in receipt of our services the sort of quality service that we, that they deserve then I have to say that we can have as many reports of this nature as we like, but you have got to acknowledge the need to change and you have got to stop resenting the rights of parents and governors to run schools, you've got to stop being obstructive to competitive tendering and you have got to stop arguing for the retention of services where it's patently obvious that there's over provision. Now but you don't have to but it in fact if, there's no point that's it get you do your arguing through the Chairman If you wish to continue or you wish to recreate a nineteenth century corporatist local authority that's fine. If you wish to deliver Inappropriate services at a higher cost than necessary to members of the public, that's fine. At least have the honesty to admit it and not to vote for an a management initiative that says we're gonna become an enabling authority and then it subsequently to deny every single measure that will allow that to happen. Thank you. Sorry Mr Thank you Chairman. Erm I heard er Professor have a go at cabinet government. Can I throw one back at him? Because one of the Liberal Democrat experiments in Tower Hamlets er devolving real power, real power to area councils or or community councils has suddenly backfired and allowed a noxious element to it, to creep in because, if I might just carry on. What happens is that the council is Liberal Democrat controlled and the area council is Labour controlled and these two fight and that's allowed the third obnoxious force to creep through so it's not just Conservative cabinet government that is the problem. Gentlemen, I I do want to make a point because I know we're not ready for elected Mayors or cabinet governments but I do think we c we can do a lot more to er improve our own internal workings here. Th there's still too much trivia on committee agendas. W we still seem to debate certain things three, four and five times they creep their way through to the main committee and full council and I have to say that the point in para B about the report we've been sent not recognising the reduction in local er government responsibilities it it is it's a bit rich, because our response to that report doesn't recognise that when I first arrived here Chairman we had the education department which was responsible for all the schools, six colleges of further education, college of art, college of agriculture, the teacher training college at and a major polytechnic. It had three education sub committees, a major education committee, numerous sub committees, working parties and all sorts. All that's now gone. Schools run themselves some have left the authority, we still have three education sub committees a major education committee, numerous sub groups and working parties and it's gone time we recognised the changing world and streamlined the members side of the education department in the same way that the officer side's been streamlined and slimmed down. Thank you Er, Mike Mrs Like insisting that tenant. you've spoken. I would like to Mrs , Mrs is speaking. Mrs is speaking Chairman, my point of order, my point of order I second and I reserve my remarks I was waiting to see if you called me last. Right. I assume you were asking me if I got any remarks last I got you down in sight yes. Thank you Chairman. I'd like to congratulate the officers and the members on the formulation of these decisions. All of them as far as paragraph B is concerned it deals with the reduction in local government responsibilities and the growth of non-elected bodies. Need I remind council about such things as charge capping the fact that the government wishes to remove non-elected members or a majority of them, from police committees. Need I remind council of the fact that the funding for grant maintained schools will be entirely in the hands of fifteen people that are nominated by the government and nobody else. No. And as far as non-elected bodies goes about two fifths of all public money is now spent by quangos who are not accountable to the people of this country in any way shape or form so I recommend all of these decisions, including paragraph B. It is absolutely essential that the democratic base of this country is not eroded in any way. There should be a majority of the citizens involved in the decision making of local government and national government. I and my colleague here have the pleasure and the privilege of serving on a vast majority of a Liberal Democrat erm local authority. Heaven help it if we or any other minority among a majority party, of any colour of any persuasion, was allowed to govern as an as an executive. That would be totally wrong and totally undemocratic and heaven help us if we ended back in the situation where we had a lady in number ten Downing Street who waved the hand bag at all and sundry without any thought at all for the democratic situation Can you be quiet please. The democratic base must remain as wide as possible and I commend all these paragraphs to council. Thank you. I'm advised that the Chairman can call the reserve, the speaker who reserved his remarks at any time. Now, I appreciate my, there wasn't time to overrule really but in this incidence do you wish to speak but if that point can be made so that it for future debate we know it. Right, would you want to speak, you reserved your remark. Not really, just to endorse the comments that councillor made. Every council, er every councillor on this authority is of equal value to the people who elected them er and to the electorate and their role is very much diminished by anything to do with a er executive erm er government of that nature. I endorse everything that was said and everything that said. Mr do you wish to reply? I must er thank Mr for really outlining what it's all about and cover all the issues because because Mr referred to no part being taken away. Mrs quite right, what about the quangos? They're growing up all over the place and as you say, Ernie he he he did say about education but whose gonna run education in the future same as social services, you'll soon find they'll social services up into the health service. The health service which we've ignored democratic likes of people just appointed. Is this wha what you want for the future? I think the I I'm pleased that this is in the in B, because let 'em know how we feel about it. We'll not follow these quangos, we're not for taking away the power, the power should mean at least we're accountable. Councils are accountable to the electorate and that's how it should be. Because because you say about, he is accountable to the people because the the councils win the ballot box. And the members? The members are accountable and let me go back about the committees. I make no apology for the number of committees that we have and I make no apology for the numbers on the committee. Because it makes sure that it is democratically run. Let me point out and another thing to that members are allowed to play as full a part in the decisions of this council. Because was before the observations of Mr it just that you're going back to cabinet government anyway cos you say t take a few on each committee, just have a few small committees and they'll do the job. I can tell you you're in for some trouble if you start that because I I is you you're all in trouble if you want to start these smaller committees, we have looked at the committees and as I say we make no apology for the number of committees or the number that's on 'em. But on the question of competitive tendering I think mentioned by Mr which he says we should have a different attitude. We will have a different attitude, we'll bear to watch what is happening in competitive tendering and to ask questions and to get the right the facts on competitive tendering because we found a lot of these round the competitive tendering don't you, don't you worry and we ain't finished with it yet I can tell you and also we have ev , the people who are, the in house, walking in the house, have a right to have some protection from it, to see that when we dole out those contracts that it least they are genuine and they've got a someone to see that that their interest is looked after. I would commend the motion as it stand Chairman and hope that the that the council will vote for it. And now I will take the vote. Those in favour please show. It think that's carried Chairman. Yes. those against. That's carried. That is carried right right, thank you. We will now have a tea break, back here at five and twenty to six. Right, I think we'll call them to order shall we. Yes, let's A thought er went, slipped by me er we must upon this council thank the committee staff that controlled the multitude outside, er they weren't trained for it but can the er thanks of this council for their endeavours in keeping the situation calm be recorded. Er, now then, next item er the Moat Centre Highfields youth er marked Mr . Chairman. Can I can I informally move section B on the policy and resources put forward. You can. Moat Centre and Highfield youth community centre because Chairman that there is er some amendments I'd formally move. Secretary has reserved the right to speak Chair. Amendments Amendments have we got. Amendment by Mr Erm, we feel we need to move this amendment, cos it appears to be the only way to actually get the council decision implemented Chairman and to avoid a continuation of the wrecking tactics used by the Labour group. Every time this matter's been before either committee or council there has been a majority in favour of the merger principles. The delay in making progress has blighted the development of the provision in the area and in particular, the leaking of the report of the problems of the moat centre has brought some dreadful headlines about the area and I hope whoever leaked that document is pleased with himself herself himself theirselves. Now, I understand Chairman that the Lib Dems have changed their minds now and succumbed to the demands of the Labour group I will not support this amendment. I I find this quite extraordinary Chairman after two years of consistently arguing and voting in committee and at council, they appear to have been bought off by the Labour group and now intend to to support a fudged half merger, half federation option. If they really believe that the merger was the best way forward, they must now be be supporting something that they know to be less than best and and this is now rendered all the bad feeling and all the destruction of the past two years, a complete waste of time. If this is what is offered as the advantage of a hung council, I fail to see the benefit. We remain convinced that full merger is the best way forward and the amendment will e enable the project to make progress If the Lib Dems have changed their mind Chairman and do support the forthcoming Labour amendment erm th the worst aspect for me is that I've lost a bet because Bob bet me a year ago that the Lib Dems would not last the distance and he's been proved right. Now what have we got. Mr . Thank you Chairman. I assume Chairman that that if this amendment is whether it is carried or not we should be debating the other amendments separately. Sorry I'm sorry I was, I was looking for speakers, I'm ever so sorry sorry Chairman. Yes. We we shall, if this amendment, whatever happens to this amendment the other amendment will be fought separately and it will be debated separately. there are no speakers on this so put the the amendment. Well may I, may I second it please Chair? If you yes Yep. Do you wish to speak on it? Yes please. I I do second it because if all aspects I actually supported, that is to say I support that the the first part of the of the amendment which is the motion from the policy and resources committee as well as the bit that has been er added on erm as far as the latter is concerned I support it, largely for the reason that Mr has explained. It is not a particularly satisfactory way of progressing I accept that. But on the other hand the delays that have been caused by procedural motions and I accept that that nevertheless contributed a great deal to added uncertainty and added unrest in the Highfields area. At one of the effects of that delay I suspect has been the need for the supplementary estimate which is measured, er mentioned in part B. A good part of that is I think, a consequence of the delay that we've had in implementing the wishes that this council has expressed before. Thirty seven thousand pounds is a lot of money it's a lot of money even compared with the five hundred odd thousand that's already in the revenue budget for er the operation of these two centres. It's even a lot of money I think compared with the what is it, one point four million pounds that is transferred th through the youth and community budget into the Highfields area and that itself is a lot of money when people recognise that we are actually spending the equivalent of one tenth of the total county youth and community budget in one area of the county. We had questions at the very beginning of this meeting which seems an awful long time ago now er asking for youth provision in other areas of the county. Well I'm sure that those other areas are, would be just as anxious of the people to have Can I have some respect for the speaker adequate youth and community provision in their areas. I know I would and I wouldn't blame anybody else for doing so. So, the situation in that is quite serious and it behoves us to take it seriously, it behoves us to make sure that if we are putting resources of that magnitude or of any magnitude perhaps, then we have to make sure that they are managed properly for the effective delivery of the services which we intend er that them to be used for. It's for that reason that I still support the original line which was to merge the centres with a common management structure headed by a single head of the project. That I support the addition that that we that we should get on with it as quickly as possible and I suppose also that I regret the support that the request for an extra thirty seven thousand or whatever it is pounds in order to enable that to be carried out. So therefore Chairman I I do in fact support the amended er motion. Professor Thank you Chairman. I agree with a great deal that has been said by Mr . He knows we have always been of the view that given the limited resources that the best cost effective use of those resources would be to merge the administration . But as he has also said,for longer that any of us care to remember all attempts at rational arguments over the best use of resources in Highfields have been drowned out by noise from the grinding of axes. Vested interests have defended the status quo with great skill and determination and they've had their axes sharpened using er sharpeners energised by the oxygen of Labour's irresponsible backing off. Money and effort that should have been devoted to supporting the ordinary people in Highfields has been wasted on power politics and I agree that it's time surely to put an end to that disgrace now there is a certain logic in Mr amendment, it basically says let us put the implementation of council policy in the hands of the director of education, let him take executive control and let us take politics out of it and if I thought that that would do what both Mr and myself want to happen I would support. But er unfortunately those on the ground who have shown their skill at wrecking anything that doesn't suit their purpose with the support of the Labour group, those on the ground will still be there and I don't believe that er giving the director of education the executive powers is going to stop them continuing to take the sort of action they've been taking. Nor do I actually think it's going to stop the Labour members of this council from continuing with their support. So I don't think that it's now the logical way forward. Furthermore Mr himself has said to me on more than one occasion that given the history of the situation it's unlikely that we would get anybody of sane mind to take over the running of the two centres. For that reason we will support the amendment that's been moved by Labour. Set a single head to a single head of the two buildings There will be a single budget which we've always argued for in the management committee the head of centre will and this is very important and I hope members are clear the head of centre which is the head of the Moat Centre which is the proposed under the amendment will be appointed within this financial year, will be appointed out of the existing budget. The reason why this amendment in my view is one that can take us forward is that it places responsibility now for clearing up the mess clearly where it belongs and that's with the Labour group. This is a Labour amendment it is up to them now to implement it implement it within existing budgets is what it says and we shall see whether they take their responsibilities as seriously as they should. Labour will now be on the line they will have to deal with the axe grinders instead of helping them to sharpen their axes and the difference between ourselves and Mr and I have great respect for Mr and I believe his attempt to exemplify behind the changes that need to come about that it will not have a direct impact on schools and their school budgets and the children, but will promote the services we've always done. This is a budget Chairman that builds on the achievements of the last four years, the care for our schools and it takes into account that the future will not be as rosy as we would like and allows for contingencies. In harsh numerical terms we didn't accept the Policy Committee guidelines, we felt that they in some ways were over generous and we aimed for, we purposely, deliberately set ourselves lower targets with point we're two point six million below the Liberal Democrats for nineteen ninety four ninety five. Three point five million below Labour, but if you look savings in the pipeline of four point three million against the Liberal Democrats and four point eight million pounds against Labour. Let me remind the Committee, it's not too late to cross the political divide . and it's not too late to vote for common sense and careful management. . Thank you, er do you have a seconder? Formerly seconded but I reserve my right to speak. Thanks very much. I would like to at this point to review the timing that we set earlier on Who said that? Who said that? we could pass straight to that and er sort of go to lunch erm what people wish to do perhaps . if we stick to the original proposed target, we'd only be now some twenty five minutes for general debate and I would be, this is probably therefore a serious issue Yes. one of our serious of the year, we should er extend that debate er we could extend as late perhaps half past one for lunch or we could bring it to half way between half past one, so the feeling in respect of that . Would you . stick stick to twenty five minutes of debate and then close Yes Yeah Absolutely I would like then to draw your attention to standing order C page, paragraph four, all speeches shall be concise and relevant to the matter in hand. Pity you didn't do that do that a bit earlier Chairman. . Relative to the matter in hand I take it to mean that it is to do with the budget er to prepare for this County and do not er to be the irrelevancies of machination in other places. I would hope that they will, people will not, will be speaking primarily on the variations of the previous speeches that have been made. We should not be having the same speech from the same group on the same issue at any point and also I would hope that where there is agreement between the groups that there is not time spent in . debating the agreement. Finally, I propose to call no person more than once to accept that the movers will have the opportunity of winding up at the end and I would please ask you to wait until you have been called. I have an indication from Mr that he wishes to speak. Thank you Chairman for this . After the behaviour yesterday, someone claiming to be spokesman for the Tory group on the environment backed up vocally by these minions, I said to my group today, no more Mr nice guy. . but I needn't have bothered . because it is becoming increasingly difficult to be nice to the Conservatives particularly when you produce something like this Look at some of the points here Oh shut up. . look at some the points, I've heard, I've been heckled yesterday don't heckle me this week the section of level funding. What sort of misguided speech was that? were they dance about it or trim here, what they're saying very simply and this is relevant to the people who are listening to us today, is that they are not prepared to restore the cuts made by the government which they have got elected. They are taking responsibility, either they agree with their government or they do not agree with their government, but to pretend that somehow we can not at all, some of the cuts that are made , that the f the other, does not convince us, I'm sure it does not convince the people on our right and even less more convincing than the people who are listening to us today. Over the page it gets rather worse, child under sixteen to nineteen . A saving is one way of looking at it or profiting from education is another way, apparently what the Conservatives would wish to do, they wish to make people pay for education and there is no other way of looking at it. Reducing staffing in the need of community services, it's only seventy five thousand pounds, but why, what possible justification with rising grants, rising private sector etc., etc., you know the problems out there. What possible justification can there be for that, given the fact the actions are reasonable as they stay this year. Increasing nursery provision, you know it's very amusing actually the press release that had early this year er from er earlier, mid last year in fact . from the Conservatives saying that they believed in nursery education. It's rather late for the press releases on some months later, the press release coming from my group and coming from the Labour group it was a late conversion but not much of a conversion let's face it, the word tokenism springs to mind that's what I've written next to the Conservative line there, totally, and I don't believe in nursery education but they know there are votes in it. We actually put it down in our own manifesto because we thought it was a good idea. Oh there increasing primary schools delegated budget a hundred and forty thousand pounds. Frankly one of your a hundred and forty pounds because at a hundred and forty thousand pounds that is an insult . that is three pence per child per week. It's hardly worth drawing the cheques in certain cases and the capital programme, couldn't see it actually when I looked for it first time, had to go back to the pink sheet and found the noughts, now we're not as generous as we'd like to be, but at least we try. No capital expansion. Now I wonder where and this maybe unduly cynical, but it is difficult to be unduly cynical with that lot over there. This is something to do with grant maintained schools, don't repair schools government comes along and lovely Mr Patten if he's still there . well who's next?,today John Patten tomorrow Chair . said here's some money, here's some money and a point of order you just go Has the debate moved on? I thought we were debating A The, we are debating A, B and we're debating altogether. Yes. that's the the same Yes but not D . Charles . because D is our . . D is our resolution on capital right verdict rather like it in er section eight of . indeed. If there voting on then it's traditional, point of order during the speech, thank you very much and what took me so long. . I thought the Conservative budget is a contemptible budget the people in the people voting or an increase in nursery provision increase in educational provision this is what we are trying to give, the Conservative party are trying to claw back, to cutting our budget, by two point six million pounds, that is not what people voted for and is not what people want. No further discussion necessary on their budget let's get on with the serious business of funding real education in Hertfordshire which we asked and in this particular case the Labour party. Good I you have stepped out of the debate . by a ludicrous budget. The Conservative? and briefly the Labour party, we have certain doubts over certain lines there are similarities, good. Perhaps two sets of people do actually agree on education. These may need to be debated as they were before compromises may need to be rich, but I'm afraid it looks as though it's gonna be a compromise only between two parties, but this isn't a . Thank you. Thank you, er Mrs . Thank you Chairman er tell, very quickly as er my voice is going so I'm going to be very brief on it, for er, two for about two points. The first one is the question on special educational needs. Yes of course we will increase this . er better support and better advice for schools, but I agree entirely with what says, it's no good having the best advice in the world if we can't deliver the er, er, the, the recommendations and one of the things that er has been borne in, on me, when I was sitting on the panel looking at special educational needs that the early identification of the early intervention when there are difficulties which start to arise in schools can save you a lot of money later on and unless the schools have the resources to er, er to meet with the er recommendations which are being made on particular children, then we are asking for trouble there, so that I'm very concerned about the fact that er, the like, like the early one which was er increase that er provision. On section eleven, yes we are along with the Liberals, we are trying to maintain the budget against the government cuts, but don't anybody get away with the impression that that is going to maintain the service as it is at the moment, because we are really to pick up extra pupils. Section eleven was confined to er people of commonwealth origin. The categories have been increased but the funding has not, so that er although this is in as a growth item and although it is being presented as a standstill item, in fact it may not have been a, a, a, a reduction in the service. Section er, I was very surprised indeed that er Hilary asking for a review of the service because in fact all one's experience and I am sure as well tells us that this is a success story, it is something that petition after petition that we've asking to keep it that way, shows that it is one of the services that the County provides which is very much appreciated by the recipients and we can't say that in all County Councils' services but you can say it about er the section seventeen and I think you ought to acknowledge that Chairman. Thank you, Mrs Pauline . Thank you Chairman, I appreciate that erm prudence isn't flavour of the month in the current majority at this County Council and that indeed has been proved by several speeches from the opposition parties that were made this morning you must, however, . In the other parties the other parties we must take heed though Chairman of the warning in the report and that was mentioned by Mrs Hilary , that it's the responsibility of this Council to plan the future needs on the basis of the estimated shortfall in resources that have been forecast. The problem is, it seems that the, both the Liberal and the Labour budgets do precisely the opposite, they've obviously decided to adopt an approach of spend, spend, spend now and hang the consequences for the future. Now I'm a governor of two schools and from this perspective in particular, I'm very pleased to see that as a result of the legacy of previous Conservative administration and the generous S S A proposals for this year, that the Conservative group have been able to put forward a budget which enables schools budgets to be increased fully for demography and inflation and certainly I know that was a great worry this year in many of our schools that that might not be possible so it's good to see that it is possible. The Conservatives were also putting forward of course prudent growth in important areas and one of the areas that I would particularly like to mention is that of nursery education. Following on from the last administration, the Conservative proposals and that it would enable something like four hundred and fifty extra nursery places to be provided. That follows on a steady increase in nursery provision over the last few years. But obviously it must be necessary to waive the statutory sectors, versus the non statutory, so it isn't er possible this year, perhaps to put in as we might do if were to be as imprudent as the opposition parties. What Bob said of course was totally untrue with respect to what the Conservatives did in the past. It is true we did increase the pupil to teacher ratio to one to thirteen in line with the F E er guidelines and that of course did provide some extra nursery places but last year we did put in real resources and actually increased the number of nursery places by about four hundred which involved the development of several new nursery classes, so it is completely untrue to say that the Conservatives attempted to increase nursery education on the cheap. We put in real money into this area. I would also like to nail the lie that the Conservatives don't care about nursery education as put forward by Chris as Mrs already said this morning, Hertfordshire County Council has one of the best records of nursery education in the whole of the country, something like seventy five per cent of the client group currently have part time nursery places. These figures are in the report, we are an authority that has an extremely good record on nursery education and I hope that no one will believe the attempt to try and black the good record that the Conservative and that have the Conservatives had have in this area. The budgets of course proposed by the Liberal and Labour groups, have some aspects which would be desirable. The problem is as they know in their heart of hearts much of what they propose this year is not sustainable in future years. Undoubtedly therefore much of the growth that they've put in is this year's budget, will have to result in schools' budgets being cut in the future. . Now, I think we all appreciate that the Liberal and Labour groups are working to another agenda. They'll of course attempt to claim that any future cuts in schools' budgets are down to lack of government funding. This will not be true if the Liberals and Labour groups con something Aha and that gets rid of it from the front page. Sorry Rod, do you want me to No, it's okay er, just carry on cos I'm just looking for a piece of paper to write it on. the was that the first one was was more or less science orientated an I I, I looked at it and thought how how I could how I could make it such that it was common Yep. er, so that Angela could use it you know. Erm and I came up with this bit, sort of the middle bit, national curriculum levels would be er your own thing right? That wou tha that bit would be erm different for each subject. The middle bit Yeah. whereas These? the top bit and the bottom bit with the at all Mm mm. and the format would be the same and you just have different names on the top here Yeah. so it would be the same sort of format. And if you didn't want to do national curriculum levels or it wasn't appropriate then you could continue your staff comment now or you could draw a wee picture there or something like that, you know? Yeah,and comments. Er, the first thing is I put on the top of my draught that I'd rather the pupils weren't involved at this stage I'd rather they were involved in the over view with form tutor. So I, I wouldn't have taken, make a pupil comment on that section. I'm not very happy with my box! Why what's wrong with it? Well, the first one You mean, you're on page two now? Yes. Right. Well can we not talk about page one first? Can can we to some Yes, alright then. ignore page two because it's the next stage on, in fact,yo because it's a summation sheet isn't it? Mm. Alright? We're actually at the moment the the the brief, the focus is to actually on what we, look at what we would send out as a report to parents. That performs a second function That's, that's the report at the end of . Right, it's Mm. if you like, that summate sheet Correct. alright? So can we just ignore that for the moment and focus on the first sheet deliberately It's not difficult Yeah. Mm. Because I think it gives us er it's got a lot of common things in, it gives us a baseline to work on Mhm. as opposed to be airy fairy! Cos that was the problem last time wasn't it, we weren't quite sure Mm. where we were starting from and I think it would be valuable to do what we started doing and actually to look at this as the baseline and decide how we might amend it to keep common factors in that we can all use, because we need something that has a common denominator level Mm. in. Is that, is that I did that, I did that with . Right. You Mm. one of the things you said, Angela was that there wasn't enough comment on the original one, wasn't Aha. enough room so I the size of that because of that Yeah. more room But I've , what I'm saying Rod is I've done the same thing Sorry Angela! because Yeah, I'm trying to put the excuse I haven't been I haven't presented it as well Don has. Right. But I've done a generalised thing that could be adapted. Right. I think this is very good one! Ah oh yeah, I like that, I like it, yep! Erm, just picking little bits, I mean er,we when we say actually what it is erm, annual report do we say the annual report to parents, or is it annual report just I know that that's minor but at the actual top what do we actually call the thing that we're presenting? I think, I, I would actually prefer to leave the word annual out and just put I dunno what you wanna call it, I'd I'm always edgy about the word report Well Ralph Gardener Yes. Community High School, yeah. It will be Ralph Gardener Community High Yeah. School that's the first thing. Yeah. Do we need to put on what it is? I mean, is it not almost explanatory? Yes, we we do need to put it on. We do need to put it on. I'm looking for Bill, is he around anywhere? Bill? P E. P E. And they're in room one which is down past Okay! wherever something! In the past we've used different terms haven't we? We we we went to statement to parents! Refuse and this,tha you know! To deliberately move away from the idea of the old reporting format that's why we've used the word statement to parents. I mean that box on the left hand side there could be Ralph Gardener Community High School and where it says science or maths or whatever Yeah. above that could be report for and then science you know? What's wrong with just a title, science or Oh okay then! It seems quite clear I thought I wo I understand that you preferred the word report to be there? Well ah, no! Didn't say the word report Sorry! No, he didn't say that, no. I think that an indication of what the sheet is Yes. for the benefit of Mm. whoever might pick the sheet up. So, Ralph Gardener Community High School, hyphen and, I would say annual out because Mm. Mhm. it might well be May not be annual! Right Mm. Mhm. and we either go with the word report or we look for an alternative word or words. What is what is the, what is the, is assessment not the word to use these days? Mm. No, it's not a report is it? cos if we're reporting, we're not assessing. Mhm. It is a report to parents and I mean, under legislation we have to report report to parents. Well I mean I I was That's just looking at that one where we said well report to parents Annual report to parents , yeah. you know, and is that is that satisfactory? Well that Or do we want to call it something different? In that case should call it subject report? Subject report instead of annual got enough space in there only make it small. Do we need subject report in if you're going, I'm sorry if we're spli , if you're gonna have a box with you're subject name in? Cos it's obvious Mhm. that it's a subject report, if you've got report Yes. right, says science or art and design or whatever Well just put report! Report will do. And leave the title next to it. Yes. Yeah. okay. But will the Altho , although if one is eventually going to talk about the report one could to make it clear to the parents that what one is a subject report and the other is a summate report. Mhm. Er, therefore make a distinction between the two parts of the report, You mean rather then the , the report? No, I think Mm mm. Ah! We a we no we agreed, we agreed a on a fi We need to shift to to the procedure that we would probably have and a tell me if I'm wrong I thought there was a sort of general agreement without it being sort of firmly agreed that we were going to go for a format of subject specific reports still coming to form tutor who would complete some sort of general report, is that Yes. not what we had in mind? And that general report would be in a sense a summate report or a form tutor report or a er, pupil management report, whatever title Mm. it is we're gonna Mm. use. Mm. So is is that the context of the word report Andrew, er, that you're using. Well my feeling was that we had agreed that the parents would sent the subject reports Yeah. where they never have been sent before Yes. as well as the summate report. Oh yes! Yes , yes they would go as well I'm not Yeah saying alright, yes that would go as well! Well I think that's certainly And on that basis I'm not sure we need subject report in just a report and subject in the box. Perfect , perfectly logical that! Yeah? Mm. But as a necessary But we would still have a form tutor input i.e. a summation Yeah , but some chance for the youngster in a but yo with records of achievement i.e. But do you agree that that everybody in each subject should fill in that? Something like that. Oh well wait till you get round to that, we sti Really? Yes, oh yes, I think that should I mean, it's a , it's the be summarised in the form of some sort of Giving what we're being asked to do we do need to have something that focus on general skills and abilities, we've gotta decide what they are. Mm. But, yes, I agree we need something like that. But the big problem at present is that that form tutors get loads of information sent to them and then they have to summarise it, and an awful lot of what has been done by the subjects It's wasted, It's just wasted the form teacher! Right, if this is going on just keep it! we said the last time, did we not? That if this is going home then that sort of thing doesn't need to come from a form tutor, other than a sa er a sort of generalised one as well, if you like. Aye, it's the form tutor one needn't Mm. needn't be, I mean once they've got all of this the form tutor one needn't be anything . The form tutor can well can build in a lot of good practises that have been built in The the form I se over the years. I'm I'm I see the form tutor one as being now we've got hold of record of achievement as being part of the developmental process of a record of achievement, now our youngsters know what a personal statement is, form tutors are happier with a joint statement it's taken us four years Three or four three four years to get there but it strikes me that we can actually start moving towards that process, not a full sheet of a personal No. statement, but we can start moving towards a personal statement You can right the way across the school so we've actually got a standardised format and everybo everybody's involved in it all the way. And there's still no reason why in that sa er, joint statement that our subject reports No. to them needn't be a, er a starting point, a key for discussion between Absolutely! the child and the tutor. I mean you could have, if you have basically what we're saying is that you have a whole load of of subject reports and on the top of it you've got form tutor report Yes. which is basically er a summary of A positive comment, an overall positive comment based on all Su sa the other reports. summarising wha , the same sort of thing as they're gonna get in the fifth year of the That's right! to build up maybe you know, individual statement, joint statement perhaps on on the sheet But it allows Mm. in keeping with, it allows that opportunity as you know as a form tutor, somebody's been on a a a residential weekend Mm. to include the other things that we've done, so all I'm trying to say is, it's in keeping with the philosophy of records of achievement. That's right,, yes! Their, their, their out of school activities Yeah! anything like that. But but, you should also be be sure that the form tutor pro can clarify things for parents because although, no no matter how hard you try to make this erm, a clear and easily understandable document it's only clear and un easily understandable to us. Yes, but all form tutors are gonna have to become aware of each subject's Cos they're gonna be you know they're gonna be they are they're gonna be summarising them a all the They are. time That's right. and hopefully it's not gonna change! No, and it'll make it a lot easier for the form tha these are the same format Mm. So that they can do that quickly and easily Mhm. and make it easier for the parent to understand whether this is good or bad. Ah yes, it's just gotta the Well I don't think, they don't that choose but sometimes that change. parents have come to me and said so and so's only got a C, it's appalling! I think , I think that's very well laid out, I think that's quite self explanatory to Er, for us it is, yes but I think I think it's Oh yeah! reasonably clear for parents actually. I I think one of the other points Makes sense. Quite a lot of parents. Quite a lot of parents. Yeah, okay. One of the other points about it is that it will erm er, in in the minds of the parents the they will see this one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten er being used, poor, satisfactory, excellent and it will get them into the idea of what these levels Mm. are. Yes. And they will therefore be able providing it's it's used in that format Oh yeah. it will be able to interpret for them what these numbers mean in the middle bit. Mm. Mhm. Don, do you envisage the er the general skills and abilities being done by pupils or pupils and staff together or I thought, I I well, I don't envisage anything but I mean I would of thought that kids could fill it in in pencil and then we do the same as we did before a and and that the staff in some way put in their own. Mhm. Ca can we just look at a I don't know which way to to be specific or to look at the general first, can I just a make some general comments about the, I mean I like that we talked about that before, I like the ten levels Yes. I think we need to bla , talk about what the general skills and abilities are. Mm. I wonder about the pupil comment being divorced from the staff comment I wondered whether they one should follow the other. I would rather not have that on the subject reports but if it's going to be on i for the sake of coherence the comments should be together. Mm you see I I it's it's trying to find the balance isn't it? I I'm er ah I like to think that the youngsters have actually got some input into the report, I think it's important Yes, I'm not saying deny that but at the same time I would want to afford er, you as heads of departments er er everybody's heads of department a little bit of leeway what i what if, what wa wa we have to be careful about this that we set a standard but allow a little leeway because all departments are slightly different and want to approach things Mm. slightly differently and what I'm trying to say is I don't want the leeway to weaken the strength of the reporting do you know what I mean? Yeah. Mm. And if you don't feel that you can fit in a pupil comment, you have to be very careful here because some people will take it as a cop-out and not do it and a that worries me and it has happened and I think it is important that the youngsters are actually given some guidance and the opportunity to do it. You're Yes. saying you're not in a position to do that in the moment or you wouldn't want No. to do that? No, I'm not saying that, I've Have I got the wrong end of the stick? I'm not saying it like that, what I'm saying is I would pref , yes, I would like them to be involved in it a as far as my subject reports are concerned I would like our reports that we do, we do involve the kids, I pass them out, we discuss them and I'll re-draft but I would not, rather not have their written sample on that piece. Okay. I think they get fed up and I don't think that a that language-wise they have the vocabulary in the school to be able to pluck out meaningful comments and you know, and go right across the curriculum there I think dif let me finish! Mm. Er, it's difficult for them. Erm, I think you should involve them but I think it'll be preferable if it was one to one with the form tutor i that time and the form tutor has taking an over-view Mhm. and they were taking over-view as well right? Now that's what I'd prefer, but in every, you know the majority go against me and they want it in a as I say I I would, I think that it'd be better placed at the top. Guidance? I prefer the pu pupil comment to be honest. You would like the pupils to to make their own written comment in there? I'd also like the national curriculum levels to come straight underneath course one. Yes. You see I felt Can we no ,ca Yes, comments together. can we just come back to the pupil comment business, one thing at a time for a moment and can we try and get how people feel the reason about whether they want a pupil comment in. The reason I'd put pu pupil comment where it is, is because so far as I was concerned the top half of that I was gonna, was gonna be filled in by staff it is a report. Mm. That's the top part the bottom part is open to negotiation and that's why I've put them altogether at the bottom. Well Mhm. Don the staff comment one could come under the national curriculum levels if you Yeah, you mean out Yes. outline then that Yeah. bit then staff comment? Yes. Can I come back to my original question, which was yo Pupil comments. you you want pupil comment Yes or no? Paul? Andrew, your thoughts? Yes, if we didn't have pupil comment we would miss some absolute pearls like Mr is a lying git! And, you know only I couldn't live without that! What was that word? Git! You've convinced me Andrew! Was that Is that Bet he then! is that, but you Has it? but you do have to remember as I say I've got one I'll give you my book later on Angela! you do have to remember at the same time that these documents would be going home and Aha. there is a a a level of er oh Propriety? yes that when you An appropriateness! yes, that and we need to follow. Oh. I would hope that if, if a parent saw er that er somebody had had that sort of attitude towards the staff that Mm. the parent would have the opportunity of making an appropriate Mm. It's not only that but if if if No, it's not only that if they if they did this i would it not give them practise at at being able to do the Mm. you know, the the report at the end of of, of five years? You know Angela's expressed a view. I'm I'm saying the but not just stage that's what all Chaps! Oh, er erm Alan, sorry? Erm I'm half and half I I I go along with Angela in the main that the the kids in, generally speaking the kids that I've talked to don't want to put their own input a lot of them don't want to because, as Angela says, they cannot find the appropriate words and some of the others just write some some stuff that I would look at and say I'm, you know I'm not very happy having that written on this. I've had But it's science this year. But with all due respect is some of that not to do with the guidance their receiving from us as teachers? Certainly, I I've told you Absolutely! I have spent But a great deal of effort and time in enabling the children to write something meaningful I I've let it in Sure you know im im improve their English language. Sure. Okay, Paul? Surely we've working from er statement banks for pupils for quite a long time and why Can we can't we, why can't we be picking out guiding, guidance as far everything Alright, I should be I don't have to look, if I can just It's all mechanistic to say that! I don't have to look It's all what? Mechanistic you know mechanistic Oh yes I feel oh stop ! I don't have to look too far back in there when we started this whole process, four or five years of throwing it all up in the air to say that I felt every pupil could comment in some way, something that they had enjoyed, something they felt they'd been successful at, something they felt they found difficult, something that had pleased them, surely every child could comment on wo , if it's just one of those things Wha but i it has then And that's on every subject, that's the what Angela's, the point No. Angela's making Yes I think it it be it becomes repetitive They they get a Yeah. bit sick of this Yeah. you know! Yo your It becomes stale, they say I like this it was good! Yes, I I I I And things like that. But is that not part of our job to get them to think and ? Yes, absolutely, I agree with you! Obviously I agree with you that we should be putting the kids in challenging situations where that they've gotta rise to the occasion and use language in an effective way, but I don't know whether this is the best way, these er er er, you know, a series of how much space of you got? Whereas, if they were involved in the end where they sat with the form teacher Mhm. read the lot, I mean, look what they doing language-wise, they're reading, they're evaluating, they're projecting I mean,the that, they're doing quite complicated things there, and also hopefully there will be enough space where they have the opportunity to put something that is meaningful and they're involved in the dialogue with the form Right. teacher. Paul? I I, for pupil comment you could ea , quite easily have a joint statement there, or a joint comment whereby the Or just statement. there's no Or just real reason why comments. once a year that er a subject teacher and a pupil cannot sit down an and come up with a Could I take sometime. Could we get round with that? Could we get round that by, instead of saying staff comment and pupil comment make the space Join them. slightly larger and just say Just say statement? Just say comment actually. Comment. Comments. Mm. Comments. That's what But I have to put back to you that the onus then falls on you and head's of departments to ensure that that space is used properly. Oh it will be. Okay. Yes,that will. And I have to say my experience it leaves me to doubt, I know I'm a cynic sometimes, that the space will not be used effectively and Well because people get under pressure and it's oh Christ I ain't got time so I won't bother! I'm sorry Well that's if that's very cynical and I know it's unfair in some context. It is Mm. unfair! Erm, I think that is unfair We Rod, yes I agree with Don, I think if you look at er what the work has gone in er in the fifth year for the last two or three years and the way that subject teachers are now approaching ranks of achievement I don't see yes it's . It's not a process wi , that's not a valid comparison in the sense that in No? fifth, in fifth year and year eleven it's a different ball game altogether. But why shouldn't staff put the same process into operation lower down the school? I think beca I think because some don't actually transfer the skill, if I might, say that. Yes but I mean, in some cases I've gotta say in some cases it is inappropriate to make a lot of comments with Mhm. a lot of pupils you are giving a lot of information Mm. here and here on the pupil Mm. in some cases it may be appropriate but if you're forcing people to make comments just because there's a space to do it Mm. then it loses a lot of it's values, yes. Right. But can't we think about re-phrasing that so we get this idea of this joint statement, some sort of dialogue on Okay. on there. Co , more comments then? Right. I think that's a point to pick up on actually. Mm, I Andrew? On this? I'm never never one for for making work but on an a on although this isn't going to be called an annual report for most children it will be an annual event and I do feel quite strongly that for the child to be able to have the opportunity Mhm. of doing this and the opportunity is one where they are told to do and they will not miss the opportunity. Well they're gonna Is be told to do that when they're doing this bit aren't they? Mm. When they're going to look Mm. at this bit and tick these boxes Yes, but ticky boxes, and expressing themselves in other Yeah but ways the ways perhaps that are not Sticky! erm you know the, what they wish to express is not available on the Mm. ticky boxes erm That sho sho should be there. I know that our children by enlarge er their vocabulary doesn't extend to erm what er, polysyllabic words which which might really sum up for an adult what they've been going through, how they've enjoyed it but what is the terrible form we had last year in seventh year, was it seven G ? Yeah. Erm, George and I had that class shared between us, he took them for an hour a week and I did and i if there is a class that any of us had ever taken that would be unlikely to be able to write something meaningful of this kind Mhm. that would be the class and yet they all did cos George and I insisted! But we helped them by suggesting Mm. words and er, they didn't lose it they, they they they went along with it and they, they actually, some came Yeah. up with some quite good descriptive language with some aesthetic terminology which we guided them with, but we didn't put the words in their mouths Mm. each one came out as a very personalised and individualistic comment which reflected that child. Mm. Some of them very negative, and how much they hated doing what they'd been made to do er, and others very surprisingly made it known that they had thoroughly enjoyed it. Erm, but the , they were totally honest they didn't feel Mm. made to do anything else. But I would not have known that children who said they enjoyed it, were enjoying it Mm. cos they behaved so badly! Mm. And I hadn't enjoyed it ! Maybe that's why they enjoyed it Andrew? Mm. Perhaps it was , in fact, one or two of them said, you know we like ripping the piss out of Mr ! I think you've also gotta look at it from the kid's point of view and perhaps I'm wrong here but, you know when you think, I mean,the these are going to be done very, you know er i i we got a sort of time limit, and kids are going to be told during perhaps a two week period Mm. right, science, right come on then let's get down to this! Then they'll now go into a maths lesson let's go into this, they're gonna perhaps do that eight times, then they're gonna get a breather, then a few days time after that the form teacher's saying right, let's do it again and summarise it, I think it's too much! Right, well I I part of me says,the the there are two aspects, the other side of the coin a little bit, if we talk about recording achievement and not recording failure, we here have an opportunity to point out to youngsters, encourage youngsters in that they are all capable of achieving in some way and to get them to write down that they have achieved, that's the other side of the coin. I know it happens in individual subjects and there's the element of repetition but, you are at the same time making them reflect over a certain period and say I have not entirely wasted my time, there maybe some youngsters for whom it will be extremely difficult, and I except that but my thinking is that is you look hard enough you can find something that everybody has done at whatever level that they can take some pride in. Aha, and they can do that in the summary! I agree with you but they can achieve that in a different form, if that's your purpose it doesn't need to be achieved like this. Yes. There is no reason why, why the teacher and the pupil shouldn't be discussing this bit of it! You're going to give them more of a ri , a more of a resource bank, if you like, right to pu pluck these, er these comments from How will we class if they take an if over view. Right, if we don't do it that way how will we pass that information, which a a as I understand it you want passed to the form tutor? Well it's go , it's all going to be there in the reports and surely the kids are going to able to form everything . No it won't be on if if we use this as the document reports. for science No I don't mm, yeah. we're immediately saying now, well we need another sheet of paper because the information No! that we're talking about No do that, right? That's the only thing that's gonna be off, okay? And then we as the form teacher sits why can't the kids look at the reports as well? But will the form teacher be able to do as you would do in English and say, but look when you did that written piece on so and so it was goo, the form teacher will not have that detailed knowledge that you will have We'll give the kids some prompts you know, what have you enjoyed? What have bla bla bla Angela I would have thought er and involve that in part of the programme, you know, where they're, where they're involved in the whole report and assessment. For for si for the six subjects? Angela Form teacher wouldn't have time to do that! No, no you do I'm not making myself clear! That's why it should be done in the No. No, what I'm suggesting is lesson. that the kids erm as an alternative, the kids could get some help on how to, look at all the reports and extract a couple of positive statements that's what the emphasis should be, not that he's a git! Right? No nothing on that, that sort of line but you I think you're taking one example there actually Angela! I think you're interrupting A me! A , take a couple Yes, I am. positive statements right and they need a little bit of help on how to do that and then make some sort of generalised positive comment about themselves, that's what I mean. Mm. So Or , or if that, if you disagree with that well, put pupil comment there, hyphen or whatever upon but lead that on, give them a bit of a leader into it. Mhm. Can I summarise? Go on then. We're getting nowhere fast Well I ca I mean can we I think we are! could I, could I make a suggestion? No, that's important. Could I make a suggestion? Taking into account everything everybody said the formats as it is, course outline after course outline goes your individual bit, right? Subject, but national curriculum levels on this one Yeah. sta sta staff comment comes out of there and that bit goes up then you have general skills and abilities and then below that you have a wider box which just says comments which will include a staff comment and may include a pupil comment as well cos because it's signed by both at the bottom. Can I just check what you were saying there? So, take the staff comment from there and instead of putting staff down put a generalised comment on this? Just put instead of having staff comment and pupil comment, you got one box, comment. Double the size of the box Comments. down there. Comments. So that That would that comes out instead of being there Can I have a word please? Mm mm. It's down there. Paul? I'd like, I think as it is at the moment is erm is superb! And I think, instead of pupil comment it should be some sort of joint say. But I think that's perfectly adequate. And I think kids should be encouraged to erm think about themselves rather than just tick boxes and I think er, er er a group of sentences down here written by the form teacher, by the subject teacher and the pupil erm, as it's been done for about, for a few years, a good habit to get the kids into, erm especially as a record of achievement should start from year seven. Mm. Can I just ask then, if you're saying to be it should be a joint statement, but you Mm. think that format's alright, is that not a contradiction because if it's a joint statement and this format's alright you've got staff comment divorced from pupil comment? I want the staff comment and I want the, a joint statement at the at the bottom. But I want your opinion, I mean the sa , the the staff comment is going to be Well you do exactly repetition! you do exactly the same on the erm on the record of achievement don't you? You've got a a staff comment and then you have er a pupil comment which is really Well written in as a No. joint sort of No no you have a pupil statement personal in the statement. in the sa in the form, in the form when the form teacher does it. You have a personal statement then the joint statement. You don't have a staff comment and a joint statement. But the staff comment is in the statement I , in the subject specific. Mm. Right. So you wo you would like to have it in a format similar to the the very final Yes. thing that they're aiming at so Yeah. they get used to the format? Mm. That's sounds very reasonable but I I er I I ha not having been at the level, form tutor Mm. but er you know Yeah, I think for some years, I've never done one of those. I take what Paul's saying, I think I'm not really with it. I think there's a scale element cos we're talking one sheet here and it's a it's a much bigger exercise. Okay right. But I I I agree what you're saying, it's very valid. Guidance then Paul? Can , yeah, can we can we vote on whether we're going to improve pupil comment? And then when that's decided let's decide Well let's upon the format. get dead clear about what it is we're go actually gonna vote on Right. because it's we've gone a bi On the a bit round the houses. Either in principle Am I right in saying then i i is the first thing we need to agree on whether we're gonna have a staff comment, and a pupil comment on there is tha , is that the first decision? I think everybody's in agreement about staff aren't they? There's no question about staff comment on there? No. Right, fine! Right. Er , what do you mean there's no question? Everybody accepts there should be a staff comment on. Er, okay and it's sold! Fair enough, well, that's the point I was making. The the the in order to get by pupils writing these er rather immature things that they write on the Mm. bottom of these reports why can't you make it into a a pu er er a a joint teacher pupil comment, it isn't just a, it isn't in the same form it's just the same that the pupil writes that with guidance with teacher guidance, sitting next to the teacher. I think we're losing track of what this actually is Paul, there are, you're trying to do two things at once what you're trying to do, I think is use it as a learning process for children but this is an annual report for parents and I think that part of it a at least surely must be a report by the sa member of staff, by the department on how the child has done, by the member staff. By all means give the, give the kid a chance to, to put his side of the story if you like, but there must be er Well we've got all that there haven't we? Right. Yep. Yeah? I know. The the form that we have currently the er sta statements are they called at the moment? Yeah. Erm, I know that the way that I do it every time it looks rather like a is what we use? Is that the one you want as a form tutor? Er, it's subject Oh. Then I haven't got a front have I? That Er one? Yes, it is there. Yeah. Er, the comment here the way that I have been used to doing these I found that I I like it and the kids can You write yours and they write theirs? I I invariably do write something Mm. So do I. and the kid invariably writes something down. Well that's what I suggested ten minutes ago! And I like that form. Yes. Whilst you've suggested everybody else has a right to their opinion and doesn't make yours the solution! And I think having, as a separate issue, the staff comment as a ! a separate box er, you know, er is is is not necessarily appropriate. Sometimes, if the child writes in there first I say, I concur with what so and so has said, Well done or something like that. Would Sometimes the child isn't really very good at writing and I will write something encouraging and the kid says I have liked my art well, yeah Can I, can I that's all they can do can I then put to you in fairness. I think, what Don's saying is It's got differentiation though. that we have a comment area Testing, testing, testing ! that we have a, differentiation he said,differenti Differentiation. we have a Differentiation. comment area when we, these go out there would be guidance which would say their staff must make their comment in that space Yeah. how the other part of space is used could be left to individual departments on the basis that Of discretion. discretion or it is hoped that pupils would be afforded the opportunity to make their own, if Involved in the process. you wish so, they must certainly be involved in the process Yes. or it could be an agreed joint statement and written by the member of staff. Whichever way you are. Oh yeah. So it allows So what does that mean? What you're saying is basic comment yo you're gonna put comment? We will put No then comment call that statement then. It's gotta have something before it though. It's qui , comments! Well Comments by who? Well Comments and statement? Well, if you put comments and Mm. a me a member of staff writes the comment and signs it it's obvious who has written the comment, i.e. the member of staff has written it, you could then have something underneath if you wish to, that is the pupil's, that will be obviously the pupil's from the different writing, or the style of the writing er or you could open it up with we have agreed, if you wish to one make it a joint Aha. statement. Aha. And we would put that down as basic guidance to staff when completing reports. Yes. Yes, yeah. In other words it leaves the format open to the department concerned? Let the cat in Alan But would you and I'll get the food, I'm a bloody expert cats and that's, sorry, and they acted immediately there. ! Terry, thoughts? I mean, we've not sort of included you No I've I mean, I know that in the primary schools nowadays they do allow, or do let the ki the children actually write their own reports as well. Mm. Cos they're actually coming up from this year Mm. I mean, they It's the records of achievement. so they're doing it from the age of possibly eight or nine some people, certainly down right the way through Mm. the bottom of the school. I've But I , I I still agree with It's young to be doing it. what somebody said that the, sometimes the pupil's comments are kind of as Andrew pointed out earlier that er Yes. It's not the sort of things that but you wanna see on a on a Yeah. on a report, on a But I mean but with guidance Yeah, yeah You see I That's right! I agree with what you're saying but when I've done it before and involved the pupil in such a report I put it on a separate sheet, so that Yes there's been Yeah well that's what the primary school's done. ma , this is prior to all this you see Yes. Yes. and we had all this we've got Ha I have to go along here some, to some of you with a bossy statement of you know, this inclusive as opposed Yeah. to exclusive bit Mm. Mm. and it allows the opportuni it affords the opportunity to be inclusive and I think that's important. Well a po what about the reverse? Sorry? Put it on the reverse of the sheet. We then get into all sorts of photocopying production problems, I mean this is why I was asking did you want another piece of paper? I know it's a bit penny-pinching Mm. Oh! but erm, because Mm. that's very But Rod, I I sti I think it is also is good preparation for year eleven. Mm. Oh yes! that's a they should be thinking about it right from the word go. Oh absolutely! Yeah. Absolutely! As long it is joint, I mean there's no way that yo that you could have something sent home to parents Right, with a kid's comment, maths is crap! You know , yeah You know you would tear it up wouldn't you? Ye well I would, yes. Yes! But so and lo , on the other hand though I'd But I I go on sorry Paul a lot of the the statements these kids make are quite reasonable, well written comments Yes! Mm. so wha what Andy's done, and what other people have done have pitted, picked out a few great examples, but I would say that erm the majority are quite reasonable comments, if, if perhaps a little bit simple at times, I don't know. Does seem . Andrew? I would , I would tend to say the majority aren't, aren't interested in their, in their own comments. Erm, well But that depe , a lot of, sorry five as well . Alright? Yeah, so you have to make them the same. Yeah. Right. Cos so we've actually got F and H on the form. Yeah. On the . Okay? Yeah. Fine. Barbara something innit? Mediterranean tomato that is. Ah! Nearly as good as tomato . ! My boss is on my tail the whole time! Are you serious? Yeah. do you? Bloody hell! Unfortunately! I'm gasping for ! Well he used to remind of when he went in for tea and erm and you'd be lucky! Just a bit. Well Oh I was gonna give it to Ian . I wanted to see him ever! Oh well! Is he going to College tonight? Yeah, but he's not in today so I can't give it to him. Ian who? Oh ! When you said Ian, for some reason I thought . Dunno why!any more does he? Too much of a boy stuff for him obviously! Well wha wha what would I have done with that then? I don't throw anything away. Yeah, it effects me like that when I drink really cold drink. Is it that? Yeah. That's just paper . Oh God! Think, think! Barbara Windsor! Oh what the hell's her surname? Er ain't you got a have you got a general file? Yeah, but . Your right. Oh he won't be in school will he? It's half term. Is it? Yeah. How come I saw a school bus this morning in half term? . Don't see why I should bloody er bloody ! .Christ! Have you got the old tea mates? Oh yeah! A lot at the front sheet didn't we? I saw them this morning. Ah! No, is this your duty counsellor then? I'll have her name won't I? Oh no. Yeah. I'll have her name on here won't I? You got the signing of . I've got it. Yahhh Could even be him you know. Ee ee Barbara , brilliant! Even got a telephone number on. Excrement! Well it hasn't got her address? Yeah but the , she's in the phone book. Ah fair enough. Does that mean the er Barbara . That's it! I know it. I'll know the address cos old law don't do thirty five a week. in er Where's there's a will there's a way, hey? Gotta post it? No. Who's is this? All this is scrap innit? Bar bar ra . , that's it! I'm sure. Who? , yeah that's it! Barbara , ? Yeah. I thought you said I was wrong. You're beating us I was right. at college. You really are!

Half three but But you'd be better of posting it at a post box when you go cos they pick them up. Post box is just outside here on the er Come out and go these go right just down there is a postbox on the left hand side. Just past What off-site? Yeah. And they pick up about five o'clock. Well there's various post boxes on the way home. Bless you! Mark! Mark, don't sneeze any more! Alright? So is better er tested by girls? They give us more work. Yeah I bet! I'll have a word with him. Don't forget push him to . Yeah. have a wank isn't he? Sure!. Cheers Ron! That it's been taken away. Yep! Therefore, on the Web it says, completed! Yep! The er people that pay the bills say oh well that's no good to us! What is the use of having this wonderful Well I Web system Well when they don't fucking look at it! It's supposed to be Well how do they know? for everybody on site. Precisely! The whole system is But they're a , they're a law smooth running. unto themself! They still want a paper system! They still want me to send paper work to say it. Which we do all that anyway, always do. They're fucking useless! No! Wha what happens if the good come from the store? You don't have to do any paper work do we? I do! What's that for? What's Tough! that for? Circuit boards and tough! No, you get paperwork from there. Yeah but I know! surely that system of paperwork shuffling is is gonna come to end with this. Well it bloody should do! Is it because well the whe whe when they the good they come from internal store Yeah. they that are sent over or what? Oh I dunno! I will just fill out what she wants me to do. They'll probably end up paying twice for it. Because I recko , I reckon they must of been paid for that because Maury hasn't been phoning up and saying oh you haven't paid it! They've obviously ! Yeah. She usually pho phones you up about a month afterwards, you know there is a sort of a problem. I'm pretty sure we must have paid it cos I'm sure she would have phoned us. Cos it's got my name on there. She'd know it was me who got it. Well it's not one of these weirdos! . What? You wanna do it like this one though. Yes. Mm, fucking right! Yeah, you're telling me! But , you said you only wanted four lines! Yeah I know but if I have, say if I have six lines Yeah, well you then just go and change them for that one drawing! You can't see with the th the colour,a better colour. Like black or Ah! No, transparent's better innit? Yeah. You sure your right? I'm sure you got some That's okay, they're all pins. No, not pins, erm veers and veers aren't a problem. You can check with the governor! Small boy! Small boy says it's okay. Ah! Oh God! Fucking move them to those! Ah,lol lol lol lol Oh ! Problems, problems, problems! Oh er! Right where are they? Okay. Why don't you do a Mark . Here to here, forget it! Now, if I click on there and see it Delete it you've got now, but forget it. We're not worried about that. If I erase it I lose the veer Ah, cos there's an extra vire there is there? Yeah. But it stops short and the other one overlaps it. Ah, leave it then. Yeah, I mean it's silly things really. Yeah, leave it. Undo. I don't know why erm We should of done these before we erm Out of the book . Yeah, but leave it. That's cos you had a sort of go at it. Yeah, if there's another re-work we'll sort these out to re-wire. Tha that's why I'm a bit concerned about messing around s straightening and that sort of thing, cos I'm sure I've had this problem before I'm sure that it reduces a lot of er Yeah, but you've still gotta do it. You still gotta move stuff around ain't you? Yeah, well what I do is I delete it Tidy it up. Yeah. and then I draw back in. Cos afterwards Yeah, but then if you run this your ri Yeah but , I think if you straighten lines and mess around with them too much it leaves little bits in underneath the other one. Yeah but there's not a lot of difference in the amount of time is there? By the time you've you've moved them all rather than drawing them all in again then you run the con activity and swop back. Cos you're gonna have to run con activity anyway. Well it's just down here with the plate And another thing is to is to to run con activity before you output the plot. Yeah. But a little short thing like that isn't gonna hurt is it? No. Leave that. Right. Okay. Er, what else is there? There is , that's the er crystal. Yep! That's good! That's right. Which had been forced. Yep. I'll just show you what was on there before. See they're not fully connected. No. Move back. Right, okay, let's have a look. It looks okay. Better colour, alright? Er, so which one shall we . Yeah. dunnit? I can't see anything wrong with it to be honest. Signal feed back is non-reflectives. Is it because this package has been messed around with? And that thing should be a a bra , a main No. pin? No? Right! Interesting! Right, I'll show you this. Hang on sec , I'll just look in Right, it's here right not fully connected right? Now Yeah. the problem here is between this point here right? Which is one of them, and I'll go over there, this is one of them. So the thing is And there. Yep. There right? And There. there. So it's between it's just on that bit there? Yeah, and also this S this bit here, which which I was Signal being traced, three nine four thousand. That blue trace there and this blue trace here it says there's a problem stubbing it. If you mark it, delete it and re-draw Yeah. there's not another one underneath. So I dunno why it's causing a problem really. Stubs in signal. It's not a trace, that those co- ordinates it's Bib bib Sorry, can I just interrupt? Mark darling, have you Barbara's address in Felixstowe? I was looking for the same thing yesterday ! Were you? Yeah. Cos I er you know she sent a thing, well I you know you sent the thing with the address and I Yeah. well I lost it! Okay. I had to get si , see I was gonna give it to you.

Not that I don't trust him or anything! I think what it is Yeah. I don't think, when you draw this trace perhaps it went just over the pin and didn't click it down. Ah, but when it's actually done it'll be connected won't it? Yeah. . Aha. I'd like to get this out the way really cos then I can get on to something else. Something Yeah well the mega stream is flying upwards. Oh we're on that now are we? Yeah. I thought it was the tester yesterday. Tester? Yeah. What the tester? Yeah. No, forget that! Oh God !

Yeah, but they're they're not really a problem are they? Because this one As long as it , as long as it goes in Yeah. onto that thing. Yeah, but you really should I mean A D characters not traced right? You really should check those. Oh I have checked them. But I was, I just bought you down here just to have a look. Oh right. Erm I was . which report bar's that the Con one? I just ran Con again and to add the new bar to see if that be back one disappears. Hang on a minute! Er type the or moor the er con You will see more. Cos it o , there's erm a set up safe I didn't see eighty four before. There's a set up that checks a certain amount of areas and then blanks it otherwise you could be sitting there for hours waiting for a new Con activity so you just chew them off bit by bit. Right? Oh, so that isn't all the problems then? No. Ah! So once you've chewed those you should run it again? Yeah. Oh I didn't realise that! We should run it again anyway! Ah! So,you gotta run it again haven't you? Yeah. Well I haven't had that problem before though. Cos you've never run it again have you ? No, I do. No, I do, I do normally I I'm pretty careful. The thing I was getting so pissed off cos I've run it about ten times now, cos you keep coming and do alterations! Oh God ! Andy says, oh we've gotta add a new buffer in here so I'm shifting stuff around and adding capacitors and Right. De dum , ay? Ah ee! That's your boss! Listen boy ! I don't fucking know! How the hell am I supposed to know where he is! They're looking for you! It's like asking me where Justin is! ! He's at college today isn't he? Oh that's good news! Supposedly, he should be, yes! That's different! He must love Tuesdays so it means he can have an extra lie in bed! They don't start till nine do they? That's a lay in? Well to be honest well if he he Wanna see something clever? Go on. Little window up here right? The thing about co-ordinates why? You get a little cross in that window Mm. then zoom. Oh isn't that lovely! Look! you can see it's That's lovely! Cos what I tend to do is I do a full board there find out Yeah. where it is and then zoom. Yeah. So you've, actually saving Clicked up on the C N C. Yeah, just turn all items off in that window all full board right? And then, what a so, you get a huge star there you just zoom around about erm Isn't that lovely! and you're there. And can you zoom off? Experience mate! Can you zoom in on that window then? Or is that always full board No it's type window? it's exactly the same window as this, you can edit in it, you can do everything. It should go past the window. So how do you how obviously you do you have the cursor in here when you hit zoom? Yeah. And then you go in there. And then yo , you edit box in there. If you had it in there it would actually zoom that way? Yeah , I mean if you go erm if I go zoom here right? And then, quickly here That does that, right. Right? But then if I go zoom in here Oh I see. and I go into that pad, say Single level three. and you can't see it cos I got all items on but Yeah. you just get a picture of that pad there So the all items on and off are completely separate from the two windows? Yeah. And is on? Yep! Wonderful! I like that! It's just one of those little things you learn when you working on as many bloody years as I've been now! No, I've never used an extra window. Yeah. I ha , I do in Ace but not in Bullmaster It's just a good way to mark it. But ones like this to me, I think they're cos if you Yeah. just lay the trace over the top of the pin it doesn't come out. Yeah. Yes, that should physically click on the pin to get the wire to connect. Oh I do! Do you? Mm mm! And then do a But in terms of, in terms of actual copper, I mean it is actually when the, when the plotter goes over that pad that is gonna be connected. Yeah, but it's still worth checking though. Oh yeah! But I mean they can be left can't they? Yeah. It's pointless trying to output them again. And you hear what say yesterday isn't it? What's that? You just only a piece of little metal. Ha! Sorry? In lunchtime you come in here and say whe where's the board? Oh! I thought it was in, you said oh! Piece of little metal is! Yeah, he's er gotta look out that guy ain't he? Yeah but Well he's stupid over everything! When you skive, you skive you don't let people know you're doing it! But we tell him, long, long time and he just well said well yeah, yeah! That's it. And totally honest. Don't,, I mean what I trying to help him you know the guy he's in work Yeah, I've already looked at that one it's alright Bedge. Yeah, but some people won't take advice will they? Well tha , that was very rude to come fucking , a lot of things and he just say Told him, yeah. If he'd he'd have got I had a go at him the other week using a fucking hire car! He took his car down to the actually ! It was a hire car?

He was none too happy! Ha, God ! How can, how many ? I'll be very surprised if . Must be bloody ! Especially if this thing . Yeah, it's If they chop it off as well, I said they fucking blinding you like hell you'd have Well yeah and yeah! I bet he'd speed it up! Cor it's a lot slower when you want another network innit? The old monster! Oh good it's one slade one now. Yeah, Mm. Well no you're well it's, it's a stand alone, but all your files are not Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! What you got? I think that's . I just did that. Oh right. See you also get the bit up there with signals in this don't you? don't give a shit! Mm. And window. Oh it's lovely dovely They're all the pins and the veers that it goes through. Yeah. All the pins. No veers. Ah ! Ooh! Oh ho ho the whole lot ! Well we have got Take this backwards ! erm You can't . He said all about four days left to get this tested then up and running. Yeah, Frank knows it's gonna slip. It might, I've gotta Erm So that I'm actually full time after today. He can't of done! So get me to do it, it's only Yeah. gonna be me and Paul fixing all the design and that on it Yeah, he says . and you Right. hopefully. You'll be giving us It's gotta have a shelf so it'll be a whole drawer won't it? You done all the converting? Yeah I mean we did the fourth but I haven't done the ball to be honest on this one. I started reading up on it. You know I've done all the schematic components. Oh like getting thirty four bars to a hundred. And how do they do it? There shouldn't be that, there shouldn't be that big a board really should it? Well you get Yeah, but the trips he's using are big. Is it on his own or what? Should be something like that type of board. Well I hope it's . No, well no we're not using the LCC's, using dips. What are they, forties? Forties and thirty twos, I think. Well there's only a what One of them's and all. Yeah, but you've got all your microcircuitry on there. We're gonna have a R S fifty two, erm H D L C Ah course, that's not showing is it? That's right. So you got those Oh it'll be a double euro then. At least. I've got a box for a double euro card. Don't wanna tell them they're se , they're gonna smoke. Get on doing work will you? Erm I've gotta wait for Andy, I dunno what the fucking hell he's done! It should be documented. Cos if you got in by bus this morning ain't he? Well . I should do that. And it keep saying and it keeps saying there's a what erm slabs of concrete to be defined. Oh! Oh! Every single thing will be . That's not perfect though! That one's coming back already. No! You knock it off by, what was it? Er was is it? You're supposed to curl it up in a, in a erm in a brush when you blow dry it you know. Keep the perm in there. I'll give you a blow job! Did you ever see me when I had mine permed? What, yours? You never fucking You! did! You never had it in a fucking You remember when I had a perm don't you? Oh yeah, you looked a right tart! I looked a cunt I remember that ! I looked a complete asshole ! he had a fucking perm! You didn't see me then? It was like it wasn't as long as Bedgeys but it was really tight and really you know? Cos his is like I dunno Sweep How his is How his is Sweep! How long ago? But mine How long ago? Oh erm before I was married. About five years ago. Five, six years ago. God I don't believe it!

When I first met him it was really curly you know, and I Bu just thought it was his natural hair but Yeah but my my my perm is not the really the curl, like hi his was set nicely. Not like what bloody curly all hair! People must er think you're a pratt! I did! No, not Bloody Chine China men always have straight hair don't they? No,i it's not really what curly perm, is just like the er er a wave perm in it. Oh wave, yeah. Ah lovely! was saying. Have you Well photograph of it? Yes, I have tha , the really horrible one? That's true! Brilliant! The wedding photo At least mine's natural! Ha! Ish The wedding one a what, you know. The two mark co-ordinate windows. Yeah, one for one end, one for the other. Yeah what I do is, I have specified so I If I suspe the numbers are quite close I put one in there have that, and I just do reverse around and you Yeah. can see the other one might rub off. Do you know why I back to Norman ? Yes. Norman? Won't be much. Won't be now , he's a Londoner he's bound to have had one! You must have a ! Yeah, but I won't say! What's the problem? You have to hit it again. Well to be honest I got too many bloody windows up there! I got Ace up there now you know. So you aught to be careful! Alright. Why? Too many windows, it'll crash! Well that's alright. Well you can open There it is. It's that one and it's that one colour. Well I'm sure it'll be alright Bedge . It'll be alright on the night. Fucking airline now! Well that's alright innit? Hope it's not fucking connected Well I ra work ! If you go on a st If you go on a stat it says no airlines! How do you account for that? What? You look at stat which I just ran this morning right? My file called stat it says zero airlines. Don't beli Did you just delete that? No. No I didn't fucking touch it ! You didn't? Well what's that? No, oh. Have you put a different file name in? Nope! Just do more stat and it'll say zero. Total length of airline, zero. So I sa , I took it that that was it. Now more the one you just did. I just did. No, it couldn't be. You ju erase it, it won't allow you to over , overwrite it. Got to take them out the root. See so that's why you should check the con activity you see. Ah! You always didn't I they tell you? I do, that's why, I always do. I do stat, con and rep after I've done D L C. No I wasn't about to go down and do the bizz Tell him off! Bedge, come on, tell him off! You've gotta be able to run a little tidy up programme, we should just get rid of all these stubs and things! It's like, tell us what's in the software. Er Come on Bedge! So you're tell him off! Good job we ran this innit? Yeah, if it'll . Now what was the file you called when you ran sa when you ran stat I called it stat I'm sure I did. No. Put it in the box. In there. Hang on. Kick the mother fucker! No, woh! No, hang on! Hang on a sec ! I just wanna see if it's been erased since we've been digging around. Probably has you see. Right, okay. Point select. Forwards er No airline! Why don't you run with airlines on all the time? Well I've got confused! Well if i if it comes up and tells me there's no airlines there, then I can assume that there's no airlines! That's right! It didn't! It said there was zero air , that means th there's none there. What do you mean none there? Well there's one there now cos we just connected it. If you a, right I reckon what's happened, you've done a delete on a signal at some point right? And it hasn't been pulled up on the airline? No, you've when you do a delete erm if you do con ex signal, if you have that on signal it deletes the whole signal, airlines and all. I always have it on sig as much as poss . It defaults the sig That's, that's usually what happens. Anyway that doesn't solve the problem now anyway! Oh my God! So we gotta do the bloody thing again anyway! Yeah. Do you want me to put this one in or do you want the other one to go in? I wasn't told! ! Well I I mean I was, I was relying on the, on the . It's, erm, didn't you do these things like erm join the numbers up when you were a kiddy Yeah. You know, in these little books? It's just like that. That says that said to me zero airline so I thought ah great, it's all connected! You know? Well the con activity test told you it wasn't! Well I hadn't got through that had I? I would have discovered once I'd been through it all. Good Lord! Ooh no! Ooh no! That one's get it like that red well that number's moved. Yeah. It goes blue, green, blue, green, blue That's a bit of alive. Hang on! Blue, blue, green Boo ber ber ber ber ber . Right, that's green. Blue. We bring that one red down there. Doo doo . Move these around. We can go no we can't cos of that. This'll be a good one! Do you want to do it? Yeah, I can do it. ? Ow I mean we might as well pitch it now. Pitch those plots. Hang on a sec ! Wha what's happening here? That can come right down here and then blue underneath. Pull that one down. Well I just wondered why it goes there, in It could go down one couldn't it? It goes hold that. Well it's as broad as it's long really. Mm. That just says a bit. Mm, no. It just means changing it. This is the same thing though? Yeah. A bit devious isn't he? One things gone down there. Well Mark did it didn't he! Well the problem is, is that you don't like teeing off do you? Don't like teeing off signals. It's gotta be Yeah, you could of done come off at a pin. So Yeah but you could of come across Well I couldn't from there I remember working on that one and I did it because all this lot was a ,. I just pulled it up from that bottom. Probably this again. Oh but you see It's alright, look I mean that one Hang on! Yeah, but I mean that one you could of shifted this lot put some kinks in this one a bit, right? Moved all that lot up. Yeah but I don't like putting kinks in! You could of gone round with the kinks It's horrible! The kinks Well yeah but it's better tha , I mean that's that's like a bus signal and that's like a ser ,this one that's going round. Is that now? That straight? What you doing? That straight? What's straight? That light. Which one? That one. That one isn't. I know that one isn't! That it's an zoom delete it. This is difficult really. They're gone now. Look! Look at that! Alright! Don't fuck about! Oh no Mrs! Oh No! Gotta go! No. It's gotta go! No. You don't think ahead that's the trouble! I do! You're a cunt Bedge! Patronising bastard! You gotta think head! I think head everyday! You've left a C print on there. Hang on! You've left a It's alright! C pri I'm getting the poxy bloody grid! I why do I have to work with that grid? Cos you can see what you're doing then. Oh! No, it's all naughty and I find the horrible! if you have the grid on you don't miss airlines. I believe you! There's a segment there left! You just make sure What the hell did that jump across there for? There's a fucking segment on there! I told you there's a bloody segment, and does he listen? No! He well he never listens He just goes and clicks the bloody buttons! he never listens to you anyway Bedge ! Look! If the Ah it's still a bloody segment innit? my God! That's awful isn't it? Ah! And look at that! Look at these D L C's you put in there look! That's gone, right! Let's just do board delete that'll probably help won't it? Okay, so I'm coming from here You delete up to there! What's that? Oh it's the big airlines. Yeah, yeah, that's the one yeah, right. Ah like a bloody I'll leave you at it! I'm glad to hear it! God! Run you over! I'll get it sorted and I will do it again! Cor, I dunno ! Look Dave, look! Clever boy! Charge up my batteries cos of my aeroplanes. Oh you're into Got my charger. aeroplanes are you? I'm into model aeroplanes, yes. Oh dear! Well , not recently but I'm hoping to get back to it. When I er when I get the time. Yes, yes. I'll have to From the Hollies take . the Hollies Yeah. Well the trouble is they're so small now aren't they? Yeah. Because they restricted the area so much if you got a big plane that like, to by pass now. It's all gone again now. There was one Don't have a lot of time to think,You know ! there was one bloke over in erm tha you know, with a man la , that I used to work with and he, he used to fly from Hollies , and he lost his plane one day and fle , flew out of range and er he he spent weeks looking for it! Couldn't find! Because th the the sort of corn and barley would, was er was almost ready for Bloody! er harvesting, and he was frightened that he was getting a bit panicky cos if, you know, frightened a combine had had run over it. So But he went and hired and plane from Richmond Airport Oh God! Must of And th cost him a fortune! this guy flew him round and he saw it! He spotted it from there and he wen , went and got it. Probably cost him twice the amount! To hire a plane than the thing's worth! Well yeah! I have heard cases of erm planes being lost in in er crops chu chur churned up! Mm. Farmers aren't happy ! No I know. But there's a couple of guys in another division over there that they were quite keen on er aircraft and they spent weeks building these bloody things and then er, and experienced flyer he'd taken over to the other, other side of the estate when he had a bit of runway over there Aha. and fly them, and they usually flew for about ten seconds and he smashed it! And they came back for another fortnight of re-building ! He said I saw too much! Where's that bloody kettle? Two weeks after he'd said Haven't we ten second flight! Hasn't Yunny put the kettle on yet? He's just gone. He's just gone What a to get it. what a lazy bastard! I'll bloody steal his notes Yeah, when I first I used to fly, actually screen flying. Mm. Tremendous you know! I had this plane a a low four nine engine and I was only a kid. I bought it in village in Mark's Wood I used to take it up the runway and Yeah. took off and I was circle ground, it was quite a windy day then this stood there with me , had no control over the thing, like! And it er I think I think the engine cut at about Well Norm is stepping outside. Is he? Oh! Is he? Yeah. Ooh, my God ! I'm a man myself, ha? But er, is he though? Erm yeah er e , I couldn't hit, you know, just went outside and er what was this? Er, I went out the next day to go to er th yeah that was a Sunday I lost it. And before I went to school on the Monday, drove back down the marsh and went in this forest trying to find it. And we went round this estate can't remember where it was and erm thought knock on the doors and se , ask people had seen it and then later in the day this woman phoned up and said she saw a couple of kids walk down the road with it and sort of ca , called them over and said oh I heard that his, his . So I got it back. That was lucky! And it wasn't broken! I was Yeah? absolutely flabbergasted! That was a bit lucky! Could of been a gonner there! Could of been indeed. Drink? Well drop one, they're still looking. They're still looking. No, I I got plenty of time, I'm not in a hurry. Cos I I got plenty of time. Still looking. Is there still the news about carrying here? Oh I could do. I I I I think that's one of the options that I could sort of er I could still be the li , cleaner over here. If I ain't got a job by June I could still be here cleaning. You gotta take a pay cut then? Oh yeah well er well wo I'd take a pay cut because erm well I'd have to take a pay cut anyway, but the thing is though, with my pension with my pension from day one I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway. If I can take home a hundred and twenty quid well with my seventy pound a week pension two hundred quid. So I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway. I mean, sort of er you know Well, it sounds alright. Probably make a bit more hours, and course there might be er a a couple of hours a night, it'll probably be I reckon it'll probably from five to about er seven. The proper hours. And thing I suppose. Well the thing is, I don't think they're gonna put stran , they're not gonna put a stranger over here. Who don't know the job. Well, it's a bit risky for security as well isn't it? Well yeah! They're not gonna put, they're not gonna put a stranger over here are they? Really? I mean they're gonna you know? I mean, if I sort of just stay for a, for a while but er I've still keep looking for work looking for a job cos I do wanna get away from B T. The sooner I get away the better! But I'm not in a hurry at the moment. So I can't go anywhere anyway. I wanna erm hopefully er hopefully I can get myself a car once I get the money. Buy one. Weren't gonna splash it all out you know? All at once? No I wouldn't splash it all out but I'd get quite a bit cos of the twenty years. I've still got my, er get a car for about a couple of grand. Get a second hand car for a couple of grand and er I'll still have a little bit. We might pay some of the mortgage off and er er, if there's any you know, we sort of keep some in there. Keep some in the Yeah. building society. At least, at least if I had another job you see and er well I'm taking home two hundred odd two hundred pound a week. Well I worked out a hundred and twenty here and seventy pound pension. I wouldn't need to touch that money. That'd still be erm that'd still be in the er still be in the building society could be making me money. Yeah. I mean er You get some er the old interest There's the can't you? Well especially if you put it in your high interest. Yeah. Which once I've wo , which I will. The trouble is with high interest account you can't get the money out very quickly can you? Ah? You can't get the money out very quickly. Just give them plenty of notice like er a month's notice to get the money out. Oh well, yeah. That er So if you need it in a hurry it can be a problem. Yeah. Well we could have it in a ordinary account it's sa , still sort of er . You know? Just report or not. I might be able to some in er, in the ordinary account and some in the high interest account. Yeah. You could do that can't you? Oh yeah, split it up as you like! Oh! Oh yeah, but er but I'm not in a hurry anyway. I've got plenty of time. John! Right. Your tea cup got . How dare you ! Phone! Okay, boy Oy, slaphead! Me? Yeah, the chap from Arkworth Generation for you. Excellent! I'm not sure this machine the actual driver board can I know. Yeah. Because I've been trying to swop between that one and that one. In that we see the one coloured drive right? Yeah. We can re resist the and run from to that copy. When Bedge got it in I say look le I I wanna swop it see what happen. And I took, he swop it he he wouldn't three sixty two. No. I'm not sure, is it the driver that's the problem or not? So you may have to ask Norman if it'll now work. I think we will blame the or th all got in, got in. We will have some money left behind not a lot. Cos the machines in my old office all of them, all the five and a quarters agree both types. And the three and a halfs agreed with seven twenties. Yeah. Yeah! I mean this one can I mean what is what's the point in a, in a drive that'll rig one point two but not three sixty? Useless! And erm the one I got, in there can rig well three sixty K and one point two meg, no problem! As soon as I charge straight into here, what happen with it? I think it's something to with the, with the actual er driver board. Yeah. And you get all set one wha erm setting. You gonna have, you can't have a few. So we may have a, quite another a board or what? I don't know. They will let you know. They'll have to! If I could get my . Then I could have that machine and Justy can have mine. One. What I'm trying to say is that yo ,i now you gotta order another to , forty six. How do I know what's having ? Who's getting the other one then? I dunno. Mm. I have a lot of feeling right? That's it's . When these boys has come along and Colin would he look at John and what do boys say? Well he can't have yours cos he's not doing compiling that No. needs fast processing time. Tony is the one who will definitely jump up and fucking , but I tell him to fuck off! But Colin I mean Frank said to you you can have Yeah. cos you need it for your work! Yeah, but Frank did tell me to keep it, keep quiet! Don't make any don't make war! I don't know it, so I keep quiet. Don't make Yeah but as soon as he walks in here he'll go, ah new machine! Yeah. How's that then? Well you'll have to convince that it's, it's just a three eight six. Cor God! That amazes me why people, it's like a status symbol they have to have the best bloody machine! Well there's no point! But, I have Bedgey look to be honest right he do more compiling than me. If he want the forty six , I mean the forty six I give you this. And he, and he say ah no, but it's alright I got my . But, he said if if Franky order another one he say, I shall have a forty six. Be , originally they order two forty sixes one for Colin and one for Andy. Mm. But when the money tight and they, they can't get the bloody thing! Yeah, well you haven't got it yet anyway have you so Well, I will, I will get it and all the will come in here and we'll hide it or whereby no no, no one will fucking see it! And go, I set it up all working and there's fuck oh ho! It is isn't it? Oh what a pity! Can you stick in that box? But the thing is, they look so different. Don't they? And like Ian's four eight sixes, it's so different to one of those it's not like you can get away with it. Completely different, re-designed box and everything. You still using that monitor? No. Wo , have a look at this monitor? Ay? Come here, it's your monitor, everything. So I can have that monitor with that machine, ha? Yeah, you, you can get everything. Oh right. But we asked erm Colin,di did he want a monitor? And he say no! Mm. Th , the super V G A is better than the, just the V G A. They can give you twe , two hundred two hundred and er, fifty six colour. So Is this V G A or E G A? That's a Philips, a V G A. Is it? It's a normal, it's like your one, it's normal V G A. Oh! Sixteen colour. If you open tha ,ma my window, the picture is compared with the wha you put in there . Oh yeah. So I don't know what is going on! So I'm not over exciting . A Bloody politics place ! Well you got a valid reason for having a fast machine. Right! I better get the out then. And my bloody ! Ow! Well, and I put an order in to buying erm two more of these five and a quarter inch. It'll rebo Mm? That will,wi tha tha will rebo soft. Yeah, but I think th , probably the thing with number Then the driver innit? Well if it can't, it can't. Yeah well there's a problem with that because they might be on different project number mighten they? Yeah but doesn't matter! In this group, doesn't matter. In other group, maybe. Mm. In this group ,. So if you want a se see er er a normal reception you want some some level if you want what? One. If you wanna thick one want a monitor this way,, but not a lot. So you don't wanna put all that in. But it does or some order. But whereas anyone order from this company say well what do you want? Do you want a big one or a small one? If you want a huge order oh you can look for your own. When Len sent them a five pound order, or ten pound Mm. you can leave that . Th there is a if there is work in our group, no problem! As soon as we've been , all been We'll have to write that one with a indelible pen. Yes. You only get on go at it as well. So that is I dunno, you get it off with spirit I suppose. Maybe, I think you can get erm erm in, what they done on Norman's they're using a tape. A tape? Oh that's messy! Er well if you're gonna draw the line I mean I mean it's bloody we know what who's in, who's out. Yeah. Yeah, have a chat with Norman. Okay. The only problem is, I dunno if there's a mistake on this but this modem box right? Is one six one and this is it's ha! You're hoping! Yeah. It's not going into anything is it? No, it isn't, it's not got a socket or anything right? It'll have Norm! Yeah. it'll have four How do you change Look likes the actual box is one six one, this is one sixty right? Yeah. Cos I put erm So that's gonna be a bit small, but a dimension in there. we're not gonna have these connectors on so we all can do whatever size we want really can't we? Yeah. Talk to me! Cli ,wha what's the depth? The depth is erm six four one. four one. So how big's that? That will take us is it clear up Oh right! to there, to here. Erm Yeah, okay. Well what we can do No, what we'll do first ride is put in a connector, you know those connectors? Yeah. That these fellers are on? Yeah. You can get them with long pins each si have them standing up the board and then you have another board, a board with a so you can That's what I was saying! cut the pillars those there. Perhaps, yeah we might find that by the time we got to might not be able to get it all on. Cos that is like a sixth of the area isn't it? What we'll do alright? Mhm. I reckon . If we erm I'll get a if I got time today. Alright? Yeah, so basically Then, yeah, we'll just try and get through today. Start , see what the actually gonna do. Yeah, like , yeah? I mean all the chips will fit, but you gotta . Am I that boring Frank? I didn't Yeah ! say anything you know! No, not half! I didn't. But I di , I didn't realise that I thought you were actually. How old did you think I am? What an insult! Erm He's not that old are you? No, no . I suppose about be erm fifty nine. No, no no no, I'm . Erm, so you had to have didn't you? Erm, I , yes. Yeah,yo , we well we won't do that . Erm, I probably do all that but I don't . How are you? Fine, thank you. I've got a Find your headache, but Surviving? I feel a lot better. Oh well. I went for a walk out this morning but I just couldn't stand it. No. it's no good I'm gonna have to go out for a breath of fresh air. I'm better going do you? But I've got to be honest with you you know. No So he says I'm going out I said oh I feel I'm going out for half an hour that's all. Yeah I can't see the pleasure you know. So you seem a lot better Got a lot of washing to do lie down Yeah he'd like that. Yeah, he'd like that. I know but I thought So I've bit busy with other things anyway. I thought what I'd do was I'd have a bath, I thought I'd put all the back in the fridge Yeah. and I've gotta put that erm on tonight as well. Yeah. So that might be as well. Yeah. See I don't feel as I did last night but it's still there, you know I just take some more tablets like, you know. Yeah. But er Nearly getting rid of it but I've really cracked it and it's bloody awful! It does No oh aye, it does. Really cold, really, it's horrible! We didn't do him any good at all. Telling me he got six points for a driving convic for er speeding conviction Halfords I should think Oh right! When he got erm Oh Smell it. See if it smells alright Got any Oh We have to that's why Aye Mm Too much I got your er table things. They do them in packs of fifty but in Oh a split pack I got sixty. That should be enough, shouldn't it? Oh Or did I get seventy? I think I got seventy just to be sure. I thought sixty Oh alright. That's alright. was enough so I got seventy Oh right. cos there's only fifty Yeah. So I got seventy. As I said, they do, they must do them themselves and sell Oh right. They've got a well in that shop. Oh have they? Yeah. It's all bricked up. What else you've been doing? Oh I've done a bit of drawing. you wanna get your hair cut while you're there Yeah. Yeah, I ought to go and get changed Yeah, well don't stand about Yeah, that's alight. I'll get Oh yes. changed. I'll just leave them ticking over then? Yeah. I won't be long. Yeah, okay. Just go and get myself changed. Yeah, I mean you see works' vans all over the place regular. Yeah. Naughty boys! I never thought about that. ha oh. Not if they keep his licence. No. Speeding. Dangerous driving. Dangerous driving cos he made the old woman give over and overtook somewhere totally stupid and probably find he had no brake. He was slowing down anyway! What are we gonna do? It's spitting and spotting innit? Yeah. Fancy having another cup of tea? Yeah. That's if you look at it, like, you only get two chances at speeding now. Mm. Which is harder than it used to be. Must've been four then wasn't it? Yeah. Three points Like you get four gos. Yeah, that'd be right. Get one more go than you used to now you get one left. Tightened up on that, haven't they? Mm. Don't half your er insurance now, don't it? You get Yep. a speeding doesn't, never did anyway, bother them. No. Not unless you had a dangerous driving or something with it. But er losing your licence always has bothered them, hadn't it? Mm. That's always cost you. is there? A very old Granada Mm. way back Aye. Ah, yes it is Yeah. Yeah. Probably buy Hundred quid. Hundred quid Yeah. Aye. And he had a dangerous driving or a speeding I think it is Mm. horrendous insurance bill He says I can't afford scrap. Cost him more. Cost him about six or seven hundred quid a year. Cheaper to buy a blimming er cheaper to insure a car wouldn't it? Mm. Oh no matter what he gets, it's always over five hundred quid cos he's he's Yeah. lost his licence in the past and you know, when he was a kid like Mm. and all that Takes a long while before they forget about that, doesn't it? Yeah. Making himself an extra five hundred pound a year for er having been a naughty boy when he was a teenager. Mm. That's what it's about now, innit? Yeah. It's all the He is actually quite sane now though. Yeah, well it's like this fellow that got done for speeding. When did he get done? Er Thur no Wednesday. sat there watching them catch him up he didn't see them before they got him stopped book. Normally. Normally. Right! So, what you need to do is, is, is expand on what you've read and then start to invent things yourself. You will not always have a book available to you. But it's nice to be able to invent the stories as well. It's interesting for you apart from the child. Right! We are going to do some miming this afternoon. Oh! Which is er going to excite our friend here! Trouble is it's a ! Yes. Right! So split up into four groups as wi with we did once before. It goes er Wah ! Oh! Sixteen of us so it's four in a group. Are we playing the miming ? Are you happy to take groups in that direction four, four, four, four? Yeah. Yeah? Okay? So the first four there Watch what we do. okay? They'll be group A. Oh no! That's us. The second group there, including yourself will be group B. See this Yeah I know. The four in the corner including Zoe Ha! will be group C. And the last four up this end will be group D. That's fi that's five in that. Five. So five what? Don't know! What is five? Tell me . is there five people? One, two three, four, five. That's right! One, two Your three, four. That's one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five. Alright? Use a five, yeah that is, you're right! I'm going! What the hell are you doing like that? Just thinking of the role plays. She'll be death of me! Yeah. What? That. One, two, three, four, five. You will have used them all . . Just one over. Yeah, I'm putting the extra one in the appropriate place for the role play that's all. . You keep, you keep a volunteer. Right? Okay? Right. Before we do the role plays I'd like to discuss them to sort of, so we know exactly what we're gonna do. The subject for group A, will be purchasing an outfit against your partner's wishes. . Oh yeah,don't look ! Purchasing an outfit against your partner's wishes! And this, at least, mime. But before we start we'll talk about controlling . Oh I've done this before! Oh yeah. Group B teacher now. I've done this. Group B is something totally different. Erecting and decorating an Xmas tree, a Christmas tree and putting the presents on. We'll discuss that. Did you hear that group B? Yes. Yes! Right! Group C different once again dressing in a dressing room for a play or any kind of stage production. I will not tell you what the production will be We got we got a good then! but doing it in mime Yeah I know. will be interesting. And group D, and the reason I've allowed the extra person in your group is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, I know there are not eight of you! It doesn't matter. Oh! It doesn't actually matter that much if you leave out Sno Snow White. The idea of the seven dwarfs thing is you've got the seven dwarfs and I'm sure you can sort out who they are. And what I will do is, they are all presents on Christmas day. Oh! Your opening presents on Christmas. Oh! Right? Okay, let's go back to the beginning. prepare you now. Body language is the most important thing in mime. Now, what's a typical, who can tell me what the typical body language is that you would prese present or portray if you said I don't know? What would you, what would your body language be? Shrug the shoulders. The shoulders. A shrug. Yeah. Right, okay. Group A, purchasing an outfit against your partner's wishes. Now, as near as possible you can do that. You can go into a shop and start purchasing this item not knowing your partner is there and the partner suddenly appears and then the confrontation starts bearing in mind you are not speaking. This is mime. Now, what I would like That's very good! you all to try and do this time is to avoid if you can mouthing words, mouthing dialogue. Mouthing dialogue in mime is an easy get out! Because you just stand there and hope someone's gonna read your lips so you don't have to do anything with your body! But this time can you concentrate more on what you are going to do with your body to actually tell people via your body or give them a good idea of exactly what you mean Yes. to say. Yes. Try and remember what you had originally on your on your gesture list. Try and remember what certain things mean. What nervousness means or what it can mean. And also what things like, folding your arms means. Right. What talking behind your mouth means. Looking up and looking down. If you're not sure of anything and you haven't got your things here please ask. Oh could I have one? Mm? You wa you wanna have a look? I haven't got the for a moment so you'll have to use this one. Thank you! Right, Group B Have you? erecting and decorating a Christmas tree and putting on the presents. Now, I would suggest you start that physically bringing in the Christmas tree. Let's say it's a fairly tallish one. If it's a fairly tall one then obviously on it's side it's gonna long. Try and think, work out how heavy that tree would be and how difficult it is actually to get a large tree into a lounge, living room, dining room, call it what you will! Call it a ! Erm let's say that the family are involved in decorating the tree. Now, when you're putting on the presents there are little, there are other areas within putting on the presents that you can possibly include like a present's going on the tree, you happen to see your name in it on the tag, right? And what does one do one picks it up start rattling it like the devil to find a work out what it is! Now, these are basic ideas, I want you to add to these ideas. Right! Group C dressing for a play or any kind of stage production in the dressing room. You're all in the same dressing room. Now it's quite important to be very specific about how you do this because it's not just a matter of putting on clothes Oh! I mean for one production you may need a wig another production you won't. I mean, if you can imagine what the process of a dame in pantomime goes through to get all that gear on then that is the sort of thing you've got to try and do in mime. A few weeks ago we were talking about lifting objects and the size of the objects. If you lifted a large laundry basket think about the size of a laundry basket, think about where the hands would go then down, lift it up and if it's full of laundry then it's obviously going to be heavier than if it was empty but that's the size. The difference being, that if it's a saucepan then obviously a saucepan you lift it with one hand and if it's full of hot water or something then you'd have to be careful. Think about the , think about the sizes, think about the weights and think about what it's gotta be used for and that is really got to relate to the dressing in the dressing room because there's all sorts of things there, there's jewellery, there's hats. Right! Going on to group D the dwarfs, the seven dwarfs. Happy, Grumpy Dopey. Dopey. Sleepy. Sneezy. Ah. And then take which, which one And there's isn't there? you want to use. Now and I said alright! Opening presents on Christmas morning it's not just a case of opening presents is it? I mean, one opened a present, yes but but are you happy when you're opening it? Are you hapen ha are you happy when you see what it is? Or is it one of those presents which Take the ! and you can't think of an anything that you would like less! Handkerchiefs! For the, for the, for the tenth year running Jonathan has just got a pack of white handkerchiefs! Yes! What have I got this year though? Not white, just green! Right! So erm one can in interpret one's attitude in relation to opening the presents in different ways. Their faces. Did you do it happily? What do you do I mean you must still be half asleep in which it could be himself. Okay? Now, this time we'll think about it Oh! carefully before we do it. So can you get in your groups now to discuss exactly what you're going to do, how you're going to do it. Very, sort of slow. Pardon? Don't just take the basic subject today. Think of really think hard about you're going to do. Include something in it which no one else is expecting. Quite difficult wasn't it? Yeah. If you take a facial expression anyone of the seven dwarfs and you want to try and give a dramatic idea how to present that face or that attitude to do it just by standing there without curtains opening on you and all that sort of thing it's quite diffi , it's quite difficult! But, there are various ways you can do that. If there was a long line of people number of seven for the seven dwarfs and they were all standing there side by side and they had their hands over there face like so and the altogether, at the same time, in unison they parted the hand to reveal the facial expression that is more of a dramatic experience to people looking than just by standing here . Alright? So that you are actually creating the drama for the people that are looking at you. Okay? Let's go on to another subject which is another subject we'll be dealing with today. And I'd like you, if you haven't destroyed them totally, to use the little piece of paper I gave to you all. Oh! I didn't, didn't have one! If you would like another piece It's alright, I've just looked at mine. Sorry? whatever it is that changed. I mean, you can't do stories one side can I? I, no, no, no, I didn't need it back. It's for your benefits. I'd like you to write things down because I think you're gonna remember them, he says, hopefully! I've lost it! If that happens to be on a piece, piece of paper and you want to keep your it might be a benefit to you later on. It's there, look. Right! We'll end up today by talking a bit about children's role play. Yeah. Now, in the past, so far, this term we've covered areas such as the bus role play, which I suspect you remember the shop role play of which I'm sure you remember. Mm. Now, have you, you, you obviously heard of the home corner, yep? Yes. Right you know what a home Yes, very well! corner is. I'm sure you do. What we want to do now, can we stand on these ideas and put down on paper some more ideas of what circumstances and situations you could use for children's role play. Areas which would benefit the child possibly educate the child in a different direction, a different way. Ways of explaining to a child or showing things for a child, or showing a child how to do things. Such as? Such as buying an ice cream. has a great education value for children, it helps to form their personality and character, it allows them to exercise their imagination and explore the world of fantasy. When a child plays a game and assumes another character it enters into a form of role play which in itself is a dramatic experience! This is all part of the learning process. With guidance and the use of role play children can begin to experience many of life's situations. Now, incorporate in your play, there is the, there are the benefits of dressing up using clothes that may well be available or using er, specific outfits as well. Dressing up helps to, helps children to find a simple way of changing role and to establish their own identities. Dressing up can help a shy sh a shy child to lose his in inhibi in inhibitions. Inhibitions. Thank you so much Jane! What a child is by anxiety to play out his fears. Wearing specific copies of uniforms also gives children the opportunity to try out occupational roles, such as astronauts, or nurses as well as fancy roles like robots, or witches. Right! So if you can start writing your list of, you have examples already of other areas that you think could be interesting, useful educational, helpful to a child either as in a group or maybe it's two children! In role play? For role play. Yes, it's a role play? Yep! Role play subject. Mm mm mm, mm Sarah? mm mm mm . What have you got? Erm Good! You've got on your list. Yeah er I've probably got everyone else's, I've got car racing . What sorry, sorry? Car racing. When somebody Car racing? wants to . What, as a racing driver you mean? Yeah, that's Yeah. right. Erm, a farmer . I know what I've got. nursing and doctor. What have you got? Yeah. Mm? Nurse and doctor. Yes. Cos ac , they like that . Anything to do with the hospital? Yeah. Doctors one of course. Yeah, doctors one Is a very good idea! Dianna's here for you. Dianna's here. Yes of Can I have a word with you please? You may indeed! We're about to finish so please come in. close the door. Yeah in a minute. How long will you be? Right, we'll wait outside. Alright. Couple of minutes. The benefits of a role play for children particularly are or rather is a play, the role play results in a child getting used to experiences a, experiencing a situation which is gonna be helpful to that child. And often the situation is one that Cheers! Ha! Thank you! That's alright. Your very polite aren't you? ! Right! Next week next week once, before you go! Before you go! Next week if you'd like to bring some more music tapes for next week. Okay? didn't didn't get much of you last time speak very quietly. Do you speak very quietly when you're playing out when it's your turn to be Rush. Do you say, Excuse me chaps could you just pass the ball over this way please. No I shout but if they On me 'ead. I just go . So the way you talk normally when you're outside when you're playing football that's not the same as you need to talk when you're writing is it? Er a lot of people think, Oh I'll just write the way I talk. Well if you do everybody tends to make a bit of a fuss about it. What's this you can't have that don't say that and you say, Well I do say that. So don't write that. So there different different ways of putting things and I E words can you think any words that've got I and E together in them? And we can perhaps use some of those in sentences. Erm Okay we'll give up for today. Any you've come across recently and somebody asked you to spell them and you've thought Oh I haven't got Cupboard. Cupboard okay that's a good word. Cupboard hasn't got I E in it has it but it's a good word. Erm do you remember how to spell cupboard? Well it's you don't spell it like cupboard you spell it like a cup board. Cup. Cup board cos it used to be just a just a shelf just a board with some hooks on it hang your cups on it. Okay where's that it's in the cu the cups They're on the cup board, hanging on the cup board. And after a while you say cupboard. Like forehead. Some people say, Oh must be fore head. it's forehead cos that's what people say and it used to be fore head and they change all the time that's why need to record the words and see how they're being pronounced. So that if everyone if if people who wrote the dictionaries didn't know people'd still be going round thinking that everyone said fore head or break fast. Things like that. Okay now what have you done on punctuation? What do you think punctuation means? Oh sorry. Oh it's my fault leaving it there. Erm Okay how about erm do you know how where to put commas and full stops and? Sometimes. Full stops then which Full stops which is the easiest. After like Monday and Okay. after Monday and names and Right erm so when you read for reading. Oh well we'll we'll have a look at these I E words and we'll have a look at punctuation some time. How where to put full stops. Remind me before the end of this lesson and we'll have a little look at how to get full stops right cos it's not too hard with those. I E mm right. What have we got here? Could you could you write thief? Thief. Mm. T mm Go on. T H T H right ooh that's nice writing that's nice that's very and now E I Well lets have a look E I pen isn't it. Now ooh okay. Erm now you're putting you're E I again aren't you. Right so it's very awkward erm really you just think, I can't remember is it I E, E I. You write it down and you think, Mm maybe that's right maybe it's the other way. so there's a fairly good rule that works nearly all the time. The first thing to do is is it making an E sound this I E? E yeah. E yeah okay so we can use the rule which should now work pretty well all the time. So it's I before E except after C. So is it after a C does the I E come after a C? No so it's going to be I E. So try T H I E That's it and then the? What? What's what's the last letter? H innit F. thief. Oh F. Yeah thief. Okay that's it. Now on your own have a go at chief. Chief. Alright chief. Chief? Chief. Chief. Like an Indian chief or C That's it. Okay very good. And brief. Mm. Oops missed the I Mm do it again that one with with the with the whole lot in. Just just one line through when you cross out. Brief. Oh not again. So do the B R and then stop and think do B R and then think now which am I gonna do I E R scribble there . So do yeah. Now I F That's it okay So if you can remember that rule the these these words are ones that a lot of adults get wrong a lot of the time. They'll they and they you'll see them going mm not that not that one back to the first I don't know and then they get the dictionary out. Yeah. and they have a look and then they say, Oh I'm sure it wasn't that way. So how about grief? Grief. That's just the same with a G. Exactly right very good yeah well done. So if that's brief, grief is going to be the same cos it's the same Mhm. rule. How about erm field. Erm As in a football field. Does it make an E sound? L Yeah so it's I it makes an E sound so we use it this I E or E I is it after a C? No so brilliant. So it's a good rule that. There are quite a lot of words that that will work for. Now let's try the other ones where it's after a C okay. Let's try could you spell ceiling? It starts with a C I'll give you a clue on that. Mm. And the next thing that happens is an E sound. That's brilliant. That they that's it exactly. Have you ever spelt it before? No. See so it's just by learning the pattern it's like say if you were you were playing football every time somebody every time the ball came towards you you had to learn all about the way the ball goes Oh it's you know it's slowing down cos the grass is wet and it's curling and things like that. If you had to learn every time you couldn't spot patterns you'd never you'd never be able to play football cos you'd be you'd always be a learner wouldn't you. You'd always be thinking, Oh what's go what's going to happen to this. but as yo as you learn Hold on. Watering the garden eh? Is that your dog or next door's? the dog's Oh. So I think that was pretty good I think it was brilliant in fact ceiling you've never seen it before worked out how to spell it. So it's a good rule this. Now how about receive? These are ones these are ones that a lot of adults get wrong, receive. Okay is that a is that a Y that last one? Yeah. Er receive V V. V what sound does a Y make on the end of a word? Right tacky Oh. or jolly, happy makes a makes the E sound usually. So that's that's that's great you've got the hard bit recei and then it's V that Y should be a V E so just cross the tail off the Y. Receive erm there are there aren't a lot of other words that do have C in well there are but they're quite sort of awkward words like try deceive. Deceive. Just finish off receive so that's V E okay receive try deceive. Deceive oh. That's it. That is brilliant. I've never heard of that word. Ah if you're erm conning someone you Calling con conning someone Oh conning . You're giving them a a load of old flannel and trying to trying to trying to persuade them that something's true you're deceiving them. Yeah erm you give you give you give me the money now and I'll give you the elephant later it's just round the corner. You know. Oh it's a good car this yeah it's only done two thousand miles. One lady owner a vicar's wife you know. Okay erm now so does what what are the rules about this I E thing? I before the E except C. Except when it comes after C except after C. That's brilliant but that's only when it makes an E sound. Now there are some I E words E and an I or an I and an E and it doesn't make an E sound. How about erm things like ooh foreign can you spell foreign? Foreign? Or neighbour, do you ever watch neighbours ? Neighbour. No. Nor me can't stand it. The first time I watched it I thought That's wrong. Okay that's not right but what's what's right about it? It starts with N ends in S okay. N something. Erm is this a D or a B? Oh. Okay so that's a B. Yeah. Erm you don't always get it wrong you've been doing quite well but occasionally you just if you're Mm. if you I think it happens when you're worrying about something else in the word and you're concentrating on something else thinking, Ooh what's he want here is it going to be an E I or an I E or what. You're concentration goes it's like er it's like someone's going to try and head it in to the net and he's trying to work out which corner it's going into and he's Yeah. so busy working it out he misses the ball in the end. Yeah. Concentrating too much on the little details rather than the main thing so B and D quite important to get those. Erm right mm Do you know you know you know D and B don't you? You don't need to practise them at all you know which one's which. Yeah. Cos some people have trouble with them and they can't see a difference they can't see any difference. I know. But er I don't think you are at all dyslexic are you. No one ever mentioned that I don't think so. Okay other other words with do you think you could look that one up? Neighbour it's erm it's quite an awkward word it comes in occasionally you can look it up if you like. look it in a di have you got a dictionary? I don't think so erm Erm. probably. Look in the do you get Yeah I've got a T V Times? or Radio Times or the paper . We've got we've got a dictionary yeah. Right if you haven't if you can't find the dictionary you could look in the paper see what time Neighbours is on. Mhm. And it'll say you'll see how to spell it . Erm do you read the paper at all? What do you read? The what's on telly what's on the cinemas Mhm. erm Anything else you read er football pages anything like that ? Yeah a bit about football. Okay. Erm when you read it you come across strange words you know words that maybe you know you've heard them but you wouldn't think of trying to write them. Erm Well I read Well if you if you couldn't read it yeah you can get someone to help you but if you can't u usually see you know quite a lot of words. You know a lot more words than you know how to spell don't you. And this is the problem. Erm as you get older once you get to my age you can spell most of the words you know. But at your age you know so many words you couldn't really be expected to spell all of them and you're you're thinking Oh whatever I do I every word I write down is wrong. And it's not. Something like ooh nine out of ten maybe more than that perhaps ninety five out of every hundred words that you write down are okay they're spelt correctly it's just the awkward ones. The only trouble is the teachers keep giving you all the awkward one don't they everybody Yeah. does because those are the ones you have to learn how to spell. Now they don't come in right today we're going to spell can anyone spell is? Ooh that's a hard one. Right he goes Now who's going to spell cat? Right all these words you know how to spell them. But there's some awkward ones and they've got to concentrate on the awkward ones so that you get this impression I can't spell anything. We had twenty spellings yesterday and I only got five right. Okay but they were f they were twenty awkward ones if they said right we'll have you pick any twenty words you know and see if you can spell them you'd get twenty out of twenty wouldn't you. Okay. The maths now The maths we'll have a we'll have a look at that erm tied deceive Right can you spell eight? Eight? Eight number eight think about maths. It's one of these I E words but it doesn't make an E sound does it? Good that's it good go on. Oh. That is brilliant. Excellent. Now that is a very awkward word I mean it's nothing like that it should be A T E shouldn't it. that doesn't look a could you do weight? That's that's that's eight. Yeah and weight's just the same but Just the same. Go on. Right now it is just the same is that what you've written though? What. What did you do. Eight. There? That's eight yeah Yeah. and what have you got here? Weight. What does it say? Oh wight. Right wight. Quite wight. So I I think you get bored with some of this when it's easy you're looking at that and you think, Oh I can do this just put a W in front of tr . yeah and then mm and you forget Yeah. you're you're not concentrating so you need to concentrate a bit on making sure that you finish off like you know somebody's somebody's passed to you're right in front of the goal all you've got to do is tap it in and you think, Oh anyone could do this which foot should I no problem And then by the time Cos you just lose lose concentration. Yeah I haven't kicked the ball yet. Mm you've got to keep on top of it and keep with it . Mm. So how a so write that one out again s with the the way it should be for weight . Yeah that's it on the same line . Weight. Hang on that's eight. Yeah ei oh That's E I right. Now you tried it there and you left the E out now you've left the I out. Oh. Okay third time lucky oh that was sneaky just got it in. Right weight and last one freight freight. Freight? Have you heard of a freight train? No. Ah Fr Okay you can do eight you can do weight so can you do have a guess at freight. That's it. Erm can you do height? Height? Height sounds as if it should be pronounced hate. Height. it's the same as same as eight. Is it? Yeah. I I hate my height. just do eight. There there's eight. Eight. And then put an H in front of it and it's height. Oh yeah. Which is ridiculous cos if you put a H in front of it it should say hate. I know. So so it's absolute rubbish some of this or spelling isn't it. or hite heat. H E I Hate. H E I G T Nothing like it absolutely nothing like it. So try and remember that I E one when it makes an E sound I before E except after C now that's going to help you with quite a few words. It won't handle all of them it won't mean you're g always going to get all your spellings right now But but it'll mean you can get a lot of them . most of the I Es. Yeah you'll be getting most of those right and you won't have to learn sit up all night saying, Oh he's given me another thirty five I E words to learn tonight. Mhm. It'll work for a lot of them. Erm I did say we'll just have a quick mention punctuation before we look at the maths. Yeah. Erm What does punctuation mean? Punc punctuation do you want to try and do you want to just write it down. P P U N. Title title Oh yes oops sorry you you write it. P U N C P U N C Punc P U N C T punct and then U letter U and then ation A T I O N. And underline the title. For next time if you like you can think of some tion words and and write them down. Words ending in tion like station a railway station or see how many you can but punctuation. The real reason you put it in is to make it obvious what we mean. So people don't get mixed up about what exactly we mean and to help when you're reading it. So if you're reading something out. This is about maths so we'll have a look in that for punctuation. Mm not many here not much so we'll questions. I mean most of these end in question mark. So the main thing about punctuation is first you know you know the main points. Erm just going to start a sentence what would I do? Capital letter. Right okay and now I've finished a sentence How do i finish a sentence? That's it now that that's m that's about sort of seventy f seventy five percent of punctuation. Capital letter for the first one full stop at the end that's the main point. If you follow that, people can understand what you're writing. And they can have a good guess. And then sometimes you need to put commas in if they're are long lists. When else would you need capital letters? Writing the date. Right okay. Days days of the week Writing writing the month yeah. Writing names of people writing names of people what about if you're writing names of countries would you ? Mm. Yeah. Okay so the important things capital letters and full stops you already know how to use them. Okay so you're okay on on that, what about commas? No. Don't know nothing about them. Well if we had a long a long thing to read. I've got some here. Er here we are. Okay I'll move it round there. How about this one about cricket? Could you read all that could you read that? Go on read it out. Cricket is a popular sport in Yorkshire. Sometimes members of the Yorkshire team are chosen to play the England and they play against teams from Australia. The West Indies and Pakistan. What about the West Indies and Pakistan? So the way you read it you said And they play against teams from Australia and then you said and then you stopped there but you said The Mm. West Indies and Pakistan. Now this is where we use commas. So cricket is a popular sport and so on. The Yorkshire team are pos are chosen to play for England and they play against teams from Australia comma the West Indies and there should really be a comma there and Pakistan. . There should really be a comma there but we've got a funny twist to the rule we don't put comma before the and don't put a comma before the and. Like if there's a full stop you don't put and next to it. That's right. You know quite a few rules don't you about punctuation that's good. So a comma we use it in lists of things. Erm next year I'm going to play for Liverpool, Everton, Tranmere Rovers, Chelsea and erm Sheffield Wednesday. and Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield Unan nited and Manchester United if if they'll let me. If they'll let me . And if I'm and if I'm fit enough. Okay. so I'm going to play for Manchester comma But Tranmere comma when there's a list of things okay It should be commas you have commas but don't do a comma before the last so er if I said tonight I'm going to have sausage, egg, chips, beans, tomatoes and cake. Right where would the commas go? I'm going to have sausage, egg, chips, beans, tomatoes and cake . Comma next to sausage what else is there? Eggs. Eggs so comma but all of them just before the last one. Okay so they're all so could you write this one down then tonight I'm having fish, chips and peas. I am having F erm well what would you like? Sausage, egg and chips. Yeah. Okay. Oh sausages Ah You should think before you say yes. How do you spell sausages oh dear. Well it's a some it's a German word it's a funny word and it's S A U S S A U sausages. Sausages. S A U S so that's saus and then ages A G E S. Sausages. Sausages. What were we having sausages? Comma Yeah sausages comma erm we can have what we like can't we. Oops. Beans. Sausages Beans. Sausages, egg and beans. Okay. Egg no comma because it's No comma there because there's the and coming you learn very quickly very good. And you can spell beans. Do you know another way and what goes at the end what goes at the end of the sentence? Full stop. Now you told me how to start a sentence A capital letter. But what you do a lot I think is you know how to do quite a few things but you're concentrating I mean here you're thinking, Ah all I'm doing now is where w w get the commas in the right place. and while you're thinking about that you forget all about everything else. Now you've got to keep on top of what you already know. Keep Sort of keep on so that you're building on that all the time so you think right okay I know how to do capital at the start, full stop at the end, keep that don't let that go just cos I'm concentrating on something else. So what am I going to do right I starting a I'm starting off so let's gets the capital. Now I can forget that. Now I can now what am I doing I'm doing commas. Okay now I've finished my commas I've finished the sentence now what do I do now right full stop. So you're sort of thinking at different levels. watch. Doesn't matter. let it go. So It goes on for a minute. Ah that's alright. So capital capital T there but you have a look at what you've just done. Tonight, not an easy word to spell I mean you might think it is but a lot of people spell it incorrectly. You see it written down all over the place incorrectly. N I T E at the end of it. You do you see things like that so tonight okay I helped you with sausages but you got most of it. Beans could you write erm I have been out. I have been out I have been out today. Good capital full stop. And what's the difference between this been and that bean? That's been like going out Right. and That's the one you eat. Okay well they're two completely different spelling different things and you got them bot right I didn't I didn't help you I didn't even say and think about which sort of bean you're using or anything like that did I. You know I think I think your spelling I think your spelling and your general English is pretty good. But I think the problem is that you you only concentrate on little bits at a time. Mm. And you you forget what you already know or you don't bother with it you don't bother sort of concentrating on that thing, Oh let's get that bit right. Erm you're just looking at a little bit that's new and you're forgetting about the old stuff. Okay so you need to keep it all keep a general picture. Make it a team if you like you know get all the all the other bits of stuff that you know all the other knowledge get that coming in all working together so the whole thing just flows up and down nicely instead of Mm. jumping about. Okay I think that's very good really I I don't think I think you're writing is very nice as well. What do you think? It's okay. It's I think it's pretty good. Erm one problem I think is that you can you tend to look at letters I think sort of one or two letters together erm instead of trying to think of a whole word. Because I when you do think about the word then you leave some of the letters out. So maybe think of them as syllables little bits say if we're going to say something like Tranmere Rovers. Say Tran- mere Ro- vers . Mm. Split it into each one so you'd write, Tran, I've got that, mere, Ro, vers like that erm and then you're not going to miss bits out. Cos you could easily easily miss bits out. Okay I thank I think tell me e tell me what where you'd put capitals on this one about the cricket. On the P. Right tell me where you'd start off with capitals. Good so first one because it's the first in the sentence that's an C automatic one Cricket. on that C. Right and what happens next? Cricket is a popular sport in ? Yorkshire. Right so capital Y for that. Full stop here . Good yeah full stop. So Starting a new sentence. Oh. Okay so good a capital letter on there yeah. times members of Yorkshire Good. Capital letter full stop. Hold it Capital letter erm Sometimes members of the the Yorkshire team Yeah you could have it you could have a a capital on that. Mm. But no full stops yet cos we haven't finished a sentence we haven't Oh. finished what we're saying about them . Yeah. Sometimes members of the Yorkshire team are chosen to play for England and they play against Okay. teams Capital E for England yeah. Mm. and they play against teams from Australia, the West Indies and Pakistan. Okay so what's what punctuation along along here? Mm comma. Okay so let's go for the easy one first and get it out of the way. Before we forget it at the end. Full stop. Okay. Australia country capital A and as you say comma, the West Indies capital W and I and Pakistan full stop. Right and a full stop. I think you're pretty good at english and punctuation I think well you tell me what do you think you've got to concentrate on? Mm Mm. Don't know. Yes you do go on tell i what have I just been telling you then that you need to concentrate on that I think you should be concentrating on. Well just don't think about one thing and forget about all the others. It's it's if you think about say you're playing football. Mm. Now you've got to be at different levels all the time. You're thinking about if the ball is coming to you you're watching the ball. It's going to finish up about ten yards in front of me. Okay I'm running a bit faster I'm going to be there. Right well forget about thinking about that for a moment I'll look round where everyone else. He's over there, he's running up through there, Mm. he's on the left wing, Ah. two defenders coming up, they're probably going to get to me so I'm going to pass it as soon as I get it. What's going on all around you so then you concentrate on the ball again. So you're concentrating on the little bits you're doing and then you're Mm. moving back a bit to get the bigger picture what's going on Yeah. with everything else and then you zoom in again and concentrate on. So you need to do this in lot's of jobs in maths, in english, in any any work that you do. Sometimes you see someone painting a door or something and get that little bit done there and then they step back to make sure they haven't missed something cos they could be it could be so obvious to anyone who's just standing, What's he doing there he's left a big piece in the corner there that Yeah. he hasn't painted. Mm. He's going , Ooh look there's a little tiny thin bit there I haven't done Oh No. yes that's fine. He's only looking at that bit. That and then you leave That's it so you can do these same with your words. You're concentrating to getting the I E or the E I and you leave half of it off or something. So concentrate and then sort of pull back a bit from it and check the main bits and a good way is going through the sounds of each syllable. So if someone said erm, Czechoslovakia, go Czech-o-slo-vak-i-a. Mm. Like that and you'll that sounds right I mean you think, I don't know how to spell it. Mhm just do that . but you could do like that . Czech-o -so-vak- i-a . Czech-o -slo-vak-i-a. And people would know what you meant even if you didn't spell it right. Thank you. Erm no I'm fine thanks. Now I would like you to tell me about numbers. Numbers? Mhm. What are they? Numbers erm What do we use them for? Maths. Well it's a bit like that's a bit like saying what do you use words for? English. Oh right. don't use words just for eng I mean you use words mainly for talking Mm. don't we. Would you like a drink please? No thank you. Erm do you want to come out and play? No I'd rather do my english. I don't like football any more, I'd rather do maths. Things like that it's for letting that's what words are for well numbers are for telling other people how much you how much do you Would you like a cup of coffee? No I'll just have half a cup please. Yeah. Okay. Erm what time are you coming out to play football? Oh Ooh. about half past three. Or ten P M . Or in about two hours time. Mm. So all these numbers come into your life all the time it's not just for maths you need go to the shop and you're wondering if you've got the right change. Exactly or have go enough money. Mm. How much are those Lion bars? Oh they're thirty four P each. What rip-off . Can I get can I get can I get three of them. And will I get three out of a pound? Is a pound enough to get Lion bars? Don't know you'd have to work it out okay. So that's that's why erm the numbers are important it's not for maths. Now this is open here is this were there particular things you wanted to do? Time D time? Well I know me time we we we done that not so long ago. Okay. And you're happy with erm twenty four hour clock? No. No well it's dead easy there's a little trick on the twenty four hour clock Twelve thirteen is one Okay. fourteen is two fifteen is three Right okay so you so I asked are you happy with the twenty four hour clock you say no and then you know it . Erm I've seen the paper An awful lot of adults have awful they have an awful lot of adults like the twenty and all the Okay twenty what time is twenty thirty? Erm. Mm. give me a minute. Don no don't do it in your head just write it down there Oh yeah. just write twenty thirty. Okay and we have to put something in between there. put a yeah. Right Yeah now take twelve away from the twenty right twelve underneath it and take it away. No one says you can't write it down don't have to do it in all in your head do you. No twelve er an an twelve well twelve away from twenty Mhm. Twelve is ten and two isn't it. If you took the ten away from the twenty how many would you have left? Ten. Ten if you took Eight. That's it you were there before me right. So take the ten away and the you have ten left over and then take the two away from that so eight. So what time is twenty thirty put the just put the eight under the twelve there. Eight o'clock . We've still got thirty still got thirty cos we haven't taken any so perhaps put twelve nought nought under that and take it away . Half eight. Half eight at night. Erm on twenty four hour clock then what time would seven o'clock be? How would you work that out? Twe on the twenty four hour clock what time would seven o'clock be? Mhm. Oh I won't bother writing this So one down. Why not? Okay what are you going to do then? Tell me what you're going to do? Fifteen is three, sixteen is four Mm. seventeen is five eighteen is six nineteen is seven. Okay nineteen. So nineteen. Seven o'clock could be ni nineteen hundred hours. Oh well I think you're alright on those. Erm what about I'm just trying to find something that you're not good at. Divided. Divi division? Okay. Share between and all Mm. That's the that's the most awkward thing to do the one that most people have most problem with. Let's have a quick look at where the numbers came from. Okay. The first numbers we got were just counting numbers. Everyone's happy with those with that you can do three add five? Yeah if I said do three add five would you actually do that would you do three add five or would you do five add three? Five add three. Good so what would that come to? Five three eight. Okay now so let's say if we had some numbers you you can you could make your own notes about this. If we're doing add we're just starting off with the counting numbers. So we can say start with counting numbers. Right start with cou counting numbers? Counting numbers those are the numbers you use for counting things with like three or six or most people call them the normal numbers. Now we're going to see what happens counting erm cou Ah counting C O U N T count counting numbers. count start start with counting what? Numbers. Suddenly everyone seems to be talking about the menopause so we thought that you'd better hear what women really think. There's still a lot of mystery, worse, misinformation surrounding this milestone in a woman's life. So tonight the wraps are off and I think you'll agreeably surprised by what you hear! I'd like to start with a vote. Do you want more information about the menopause? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And, in this hundred goodness! Ninety one people say yes, only nine say no! Now, why did you, why did you say yes? Is it because yo , you you haven't got the information? You don't have enough?it's not available to you? Yes? I feel that there is an awful lot of gossip and scare tactics about it and I'd like to, to have a real expert information on it. Have you tried to information before? Not ver , not very much. Mainly I mainly through, mainly through gossip! Gossip? Aha. And what does the gossip say? Every, for everything er from it's all in your mind to it's dreadful! Right, front line. Yes. I think actually I would like to get some, some more information and men should get some more information because they are the ones who are dismissing and er not sort of going along with it. Mm. Well out there, they're they're watching so who else said yes? I'd feel the local doctors, your local G P's are needing to be brought more into to line with it. I've personally had problems with one doctor cos he was out of date, he wasn't you know, wasn't aware of some of the treatments and I had to actually enlighten him to some of the the treatments that was available for people! Really? Aha. Yes. Ho and how did you know he was out of date? Because ee er, some of the subjects I brought to him but he didn't know nothing about them! He had to you know, he'd, he'd to leave it and consult with colleagues or whatever. So I feel that And where were you you know, that G P's that's been practising for a long number of years you know er, elderly G P's are probably not as up-to-date on these kind of things as they should be. Aha. This one. I had a few problems when I was about thirty and my doctor told me it was just my age and the menopause! From thirty! And I started it about fifteen years later! Now when do yo , when your doctor said that when you were thirty di did you believe him or her? It was a him. A him. A doctor younger than myself, and I didn't believe him! And, I just tu but there was nothing else I could do! I couldn't argue with him I just had to go and say oh well it's just my age and get on with it! Yes? I'd like to know more about it because having gone through it without any eventuality I'd quite like to know what I missed! If anything! And if, in fact, this H R T I'm really missing something, you see, that's what I'd like to know. I don't think that er, I think that unfortunately some of the older doctors definitely were misinformed and weren't educated and I think nowadays that the doctors are becoming very much more educated and perhaps the ones who have the bad time are the fortunate ones in so far as they're getting the hormone replacement therapy if they're lucky and they have sympathetic general practitioner. And the ones who haven't had the bad time might well be suffering because they're not being allowed the benefits of hormone replacement therapy. Now you're a G P? Yes. And so obviously you're very well clued up. Th does that mean the older people here have had a raw deal? I mean,th those people who've gone through the menopause wo would any of you like to say anything about experience? Yes? Er, well Er No, yes yes! Nelly? Na er well of course I'm seve seventy nine but I can still remember most of it and I did have a very bad time! Moods, bad moods and going to I gave my husband a terrible time! I really did! But he was very understanding and, the doctor just seemed to think that that was a natural course I had to go through! But er, it lasted, I was forty seven and it didn't finish till I was about sixty! But people complain sometimes about the flushes, but I was glad when I had a flush because I felt better after having flushes! I think we've got to look at the other side of the Aha. as well that I personally a agree with the lady over there as I'm now, with all the talk of hormo , hormone replacement wonder what it was? How much better life would have been if I'd known about that or used it? I'm from the group, the change you change Mhm. and er when I was going through the change and I'm post menopause er and having terrible feelings, I'd nowhere to go! I went round all the hospitals in Edinburgh and Leith all the doctors surgeries and there was nowhere and I ended up at the the women's unit in Edinburgh City Chambers and I got help from the women's unit and er from there we started a pressure group to get more literature to people, you know to get them into doctor's surgeries so as they would know what to do, what to expect. Helen? In we've had a menopause clinic in Glasgow for the last twenty four years erm, it's run by a male doctor erm but we have been treating patients for that length time. We're extremely interested in the women we try to treat them as individuals we cope with a lot of problems and I think if we look as women as individuals, each individual woman has a different problem. We all basically have flushes, sweats, depression and various other problems, but basically the ladies who present with flushes and sweats are the ladies who in fact get help for ladies who don't present with flushes and sweats finish up as osteoporotic and they're the ones we are very concerned about! We don't see them until they're too late and they're having fractures of the spine and shrinking two percent of bone less in a year! Are you suggesting that every woman going through the menopause should get some kind of clinical help? It should be offered to her Mhm. if she wants it. I'm not telling every woman to take me H R T, I'm suggesting that it's preventative medicine. We don't stop diabetics having insulin. If the ovaries are removed, ovaries stop working there is treatment there to prevent us having disease, why shouldn't we take it and why shouldn't we have a better life? Linda? I'm, er, the director of the National Osteoporosis Society and we started five years ago and as Helen said just now, we are in the business of informing women, not saying all women should be going on hormone replacement therapy! Some women certainly will sail through menopause with never a hot flush and no problems at all, sadly that's no indication that they're not going to have problems from their bones later on. Now i , let's let's do a bit of definition of terms here, osteoporosis is what It's bones that are too porous literally, so that they break very easily Aha. and that accounts for the hip fractures and the the er spines collapsing in Mhm. older women, losing height a lot of pain from these fractures and it's bones that are too porous so they're not holding you up sufficiently as you get older. And how can that be alleviated? By hormone replacement therapy, that's the main way of of helping. You can do things for yourself in the way of diet, exercise, good lifestyle, not smoking and so on but, a lot of women will need hormone replacement therapy just to replace the hormones that dear old mother nature stop supplying to us at the menopause. Hundred years ago we didn't live this long! Now that we do live much longer with better health care generally, what we want is for women to be able to live that last third of their lives in health and being able to enjoy themselves and contribute to the community, not feeling that they're crippled by pain. Now, am I right in saying that there has been some controversy in the past about hormone replace , let's call it H R T, it's shorter, that er that not everyone's convinced it's it's it's a good idea, that there are maybe some negative side effects. I mean,wha what is the latest information on on H R T? You were right in saying that there was very bad press given to hormone replacement therapy in in the early days when they used very high doses of of er un er, of normal oestrogens and this caused an increase in the amount of end of uterus, uterine cancer and this I think has generally er mo mo mo ruined the course for for the older doctors because they still think that it's associated with an increase in cancer and they haven't got up to date to realise that the more modern preparations are not causing the resources, they all create this capacity, they all have a defence policy er there is a consequent competition and this competition, far from resolving the problem of security, in fact exacerbates it, it makes it worse, and so states find themselves competing at different levels er competing particularly in the creation of military capabilities and the consequence of this is a more or less sustained and permanent arms race which frequently er produces armed struggles and war. Now this er capability is not solely designed er for the protection of the state, the defence of the state. That, that is its primary function, that's its primary purpose, but it has a secondary purpose as well it is concerned for the pursuit of what are now termed er in the jargon sub-strategic objectives. That is er objectives which are not directly concerned er with the safety of the state er but with, with er certain of the state's needs a as a state er defines them. Er and so er although in security struggles in the event of war we find er that these wars tend to become total wars, and we've had two of these in the present century, historically speaking in recent times we had another one, anyone know what it was? Mm? A total war? Outside of this century? Napoleon? Yes that's right. The wars with republican France and Napoleon lasted for nearly twenty years and although erm er temporary truces and peaces were negotiated, the struggle continued until the overthrow of Napoleon and that was, although it was a, a largely European war, it did have ramifications, it brought Britain, for example, into war with the United States in nin in eighteen twelve. Erm and I suppose you could regard the Thirty Years War too er as being a, a total war in this sense in, in that the objectives of the war is the crushing of opposition, unconditional surrender. Well fortunately these wars are fairly rare except perhaps in, in our present century. Er but the most characteristic kind of war er our i is rather limited war a and violence need not necessarily be expressed in the form of erm a formal attack, it can be used of course to threaten or to deter. And so we have a dimension of politics in international politics and within the state which is related to securing objectives which are not directly connected to security using the means of violence. And the sorts of objectives that er these wars are concerned with er may be control over resources, over particular minerals, control over markets con control over trade the acquisition of territory or the recovery of lost territory and ideological or political objectives, objectives which are strictly speaking er to do with the belief system which predominates in particular states or where there's a conflict between states er which have radically conflicting er ideologies. Erm the problem for the state in using violence in this limited way is first of all of course creating a capability to achieve by threat or use of violence limited objectives. Now this is a problem er because if you don't sharply define your objectives and if you don't know what you need to achieve them, then you're likely to stumble into the possibility of an uncontrolled war e even into a total war whereas the original objective was not in fact er as serious er as, as er as that. Erm in short we're talking here of the concept of rational war. Now what is rational war? Klausovitz defined this as a commensurability between means and ends. Now by that he meant that the ends sought should be closely defined and should not change and the means adopted should be effective and they should not change and the consequence is that adversaries then move into er er conflict but the conflict itself is self-limiting in the sense that one side will accept defeat er and, and the consequences of victory and clearly these consequences are not so severe to the state as to jeopardise its existence. If the means themselves are changed, if the war moved into a total war phase, then of course the security of those states engaged in that contest is immediately threatened. Erm a classic example is of course erm the second world war. None of the belligerents intended to fight what was called the second world war, they all entered into conflict, they all began er a rearmament programme with the idea of using violence as a means to secure lesser objectives. Now what where these objectives? So far as Hitler was concerned, and he was certainly the person who started the war, his objectives were, was to achieve a form of economic autarchy which involved the conquest of, of, of er territory in Europe er but which would not push his adversaries to the point of fighting a war of national existence. He really believed that he could do this through, through the form of the Blitzkrieg, that is through a limited war er which would secure military objectives and then produce a political peace and the model er for his er policy was in fact the eighteenth century where many wars occurred between European powers wa impo imperial wars and wars on, on t on er total Europe, but none of these wars resulted in the destruction of any state. Only one state disappeared. Anyone know which state it was? Mm? Poland. Yes Poland, that's right. Poland disappeared for over a hundred and thirty years in a series of partitions erm er between it's ne er er by, by its neighbours and wasn't restored in fact to political existence until the end of the first world war. Er so states could re resort to war and these wars were limited. But of course limits are self imposed, they depend very much upon political will as well as upon resources. There were some er structural factors in the eighteenth century which limited war, for example governments could not easily tax erm raising taxes by usually erm er monarchs, by, by er emperors er kings and so on, was not a popular move as the previous century had shown. Er people did not, in fact, wish to pay taxes in order to allow erm their rulers to play the game of war and the limited sums of money available for these wars was soon expended so when your cash ran out, then you sued for peace you, you engaged in negotiations. Another factor of course er was the fact that no state then could conscript, could, could in fact force people to serve in its armies and so on erm manpower was, was limited. There's a host of factors of that kind which in fact kept the er conflicts to a minimum i in terms of their extent, in terms of the, the damage they did. Frequently generals thought it best if they were outmanoeuvred to in effect accept an honourable surrender er and er bargains of this kind occurred from time to time between largely mercenary armies. Well what happened to change in fact this er notion of limited rational wars with the means, ends in balance etcetera, the kind of, of erm halcyon days if you like to which Klausovitz wished to return? Well the French revolution occurred and what the French revolution did, it transferred hus a huge assets to the, to the, the er government, it allowed conscription, a people's army and it also turned the biggest country in Europe er biggest with the exception of, of Tsarist Russia, er into a, a war state. If you remember the attempt, the first attempt to overturn the revolution came from outside, it came from invading foreign armies and this gave them a hell of a shock, the re the revolutionary government. We had the terror and then we had a series of successful wars which put France as a dominant power in Europe and brought inevitably er its neighbours, er those that were able to fight, into a permanent hostility. In other words we have modern warfare first make its appearance. Now the assumption that erm Napoleon made about the future of Europe was Europe with France as the leader and this is an assumption which challenged directly the political integrity of all the other European states. Consequently that war or series of wars er was a total war. Equally in nineteen fourteen when er the Kaiser invaded Belgium he made a direct threat towards British security. As I said last week, he c he er made it appear to the British that he s sought to control the channel ports and with a large navy was then capable of interfering with our trade and in in indeed mounting an invasion, and that brought Britain into a war which could not be ended until the Germans sued for surrender and vice versa. Now the point I'm making here is that security competition creates a capability which is designed to defend the state and that capability comes into direct conflict with non-security objectives which are er supported by threats er of violence. In short the limited war always has the potential to become a total war. I'm speaking here of the period of conventional warfare by the way, this is not the case with nuclear war as I shall show in a later lecture. Well let's look at a few examples I'll take the Korean war of nineteen fifty to fifty three, the Cuban missiles crisis which, although was not an actual war, very nearly threatened a nuclear war, of nineteen sixty two and the Vietnam war of nineteen sixty three to nineteen seventy two. Now the Korean war was a limited war in that the United St neither the United States nor the Soviet Union wished in fact to fight over the Korean peninsula. What actually happened? The whole story is not yet known, although it's claimed that North Korea er invaded South Korea er I sh I should take that as a hypothesis and not as a fact. However, the event erm was that North Korea rapidly er er er conquered most of South Korea until the United States decided to intervene. Now it used the United Nations as its cover and it's fortunate in that the Soviet Union was absent from the Security Council and so was not able to veto the resolution which authorized American intervention. Now what kind of war was it going to be? The United States got the United Nations to adopt a resolution which called for the expulsion of North Korean troops from South Korea, that was the objective, that was the immediate war aim. How could this be done? It was done in fact by a brilliant military er tactic er and indeed the Americans succeeded in throwing the North Koreans back over the Yalob the river Yalob So up to that point limited force had been used to achieve a political objective, the objective was to s s to erm contain communism wherever communism looked like spilling over into other countries, non-communist countries. But then President Truman made a big mistake he got the United Nations to authorize another resolution which called for the unification of Korea erm through United Nations intervention and American forces crossed the Yalob Now the big mistake was this it wasn't of ve of very great importance who governed North er North or South Korea, er they weren't particularly important strategic areas, they didn't have er important ports or, or er or base facilities or any resources then erm the mistake was in fact to directly challenge Chinese security, and if you looked at a map you'll see in fact how this er came about. As the victorious American troops poured towards Manchuria, the, the North Korean border with, with China, then the Chinese beg began to become increasingly alarmed at the, at the notion of a united Korea right on its doorstep. It warned the United States through the Indian ambassador to the United Nations that if this advance continued, that China would intervene. The United States ignored the warning and the Chinese forces then made their successful assault and defeated the American troops very badly, driving them in fact into the south. The war that followed was a stalemate both sides lost enormous casualties and the Chinese lost far more than anyone else, but the United States wound up that war with forty thousand American dead and with the only er partial success of managing to ma maintain the status quo in South Korea. It was a case do you see of the end itself changing in the course of a war. Now what are the means? While the American forces are being defeated, its Commander in Chief then called for the war to change its character. General McArthur urged the use of the atomic bomb against Manchuria and against Chinese targets. So worried was the United States allies that the British prime minister flew er to the Unites States, to Washington, to er tell President Truman that if the United States used atomic weapons in that war, then this would seriously affect the alliance, the, the NATO alliance. In other words we were, we were considerably concerned about the extent of the war. Now you can see what would have happened if McArthur's advice had, had been followed. The original objective was to liberate South Korea, it then began to unite Korea but if you raise the objective to an assault on China proper then, then you would have to quote General Ridgeway, who was a commander on the spot, er you'd be fighting the wrong war, the wrong time and in the wrong place. What would be the purpose of that escalation? And the answer was nothing unless you actually wish to attack China and er defeat China through military means and the task of doing that of course was enormously out of proportion to the original er cause of the war. Er the Cuban missiles crisis. Now here you had a very different situation because the nuclear dimension was now starting to become very important. The erm onset of that crisis was the attempt made by the Soviet Union to emplace erm medium range missile bases on Cuba. And President Truman, sorry er President erm Kennedy er a democrat, it's democrats that always seem to get involved in these kinds of wars as, as was the case in the Vietnam war, erm er President Kennedy in fact took this to be er a radical change in the strategic balance and th this is the way the crisis was represented. But in fact the problem was the position of Castro and of the communist regime in Cuba. The er Soviets claimed that, that these missiles were not offensive, and indeed the weren't offensive. The United States had the same sort of missiles in Italy and in Turkey and, before this crisis had developed, President Kennedy had in fact ordered them er to be er er returned to the United States, these missiles had no strategic purpose at all because a major change that had come into the strategic equation was the arrival of the intercontinental ballistic missile, and it was these missiles, really, which held the strategic balance er and were to change in fact radically both international politics and global strategy over the years to come, but I'm going to talk about that later, the point I'm making here is that er Khrushchev claimed that the missiles were there in the event of an American assault on Cuba, they were a deterrent weapon in exactly the same way as the defensive deterrent weapons er were d were defensive er for er the United States and for the Soviet Union. And the context in which this was er argued er was er the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, a C I A American supported invasion, er which er failed very badly but which certainly indicated the American desire to get rid of Castro and er Khrushchev was asserting in effect that he had as much right to defend an ally as the United States had er to defend erm its allies and in the same sort of way. Now Kennedy had a dilemma although Cuba was in the Caribbean, and although the United States had the biggest navy in the world, and the biggest airforce and was easily able to exterminate Cuba if it wa if it wished to, it was vulnerable, however, in other areas, in particular it was vulnerable in Berlin and it was vulnerable in Indo-China. In nineteen sixty one, prior to the crisis, the Americans had to face the rather humiliating settlement in Laos by which they accepted a communist erm er government, or at least a government which had communist members, erm Kennedy wanted to intervene in Laos but again was restrained by his British ally, MacMillan wouldn't in fact accept er that we should get involved in a ground war in Indo-China. Er in the case of Berlin, the er situation there was er that Russia er of course the Soviet Union could intervene in Berlin more or less at will, given that it was a small island in East Germany and was always a vulnerable, always, always in a position of being a hostage. So Kennedy couldn't act precipitantly, he couldn't simply do what he wanted to do which was to get rid of Castro, because if he'd done that then his policy objectives in other parts of the world would be in jeopardy. He couldn't threaten the Soviet Union directly because the Soviet Union was a nuclear power and couldn't be threatened er so the course of action he took was intended to be moderate and to secure the objective solely of removing the missiles from Cuba, not of doing anything about the Cuban government or the regime or anything of that sort. And so they came to a negotiated settlement by which the Soviets agreed to withdraw the missiles and the United States promised that they would not interfere with Castro again, although from that day to this they have maintained of course their economic embargo. Er and here you have a case of diplomacy succeeding er and the spectre of war and possibly nuclear war erm fading out. Limits were set in short by both sides on what they sought to do and how they sought to do it and these limits erm weren't self-evident at the time I can tell you because the American military, the Chiefs of Staff on the Executive Committee that discussed this an and took the decisions, were all in favour of making s air strikes on these bases and possibly er an er an armed intervention and so the military advice here er was er was rather similar to that of McArthur's, that is turn the, the crisis into er a different kind of crisis, turn it in fact into a war. Now thirdly the Vietnam war, now this was perhaps the most harrowing war the Americans ever got themselves involved in and has had deep and permanent effects upon American policy making to this very day. Now what were the limits so far as the Vietnam war was concerned? Well initially the United States genuinely believed that with a small force, perhaps about a hundred thousand, maybe two hundred thousand troops, but principally using air power, that they could prevent the North Vietnamese from helping the Vietcong in the south and thus continuing the civil war. Now one can make judgments about means and indeed as I was saying in my last lecture, the actual capability of the weapons you have can only really be found out when you use them and then you can see, very often, that they are in fact ineffective. Now wa the, the erm war began with Operation Rolling Thunder and this was erm er President Johnson's plan er to pound major targets in North Vietnam by aerial bombardment and make, make the cost of their intervention in the south very high, so high that they would cut off the umbilical cord and starve the, the Vietcong into submission through ground operations in the south. That was the basic plan. He started off, as did Truman, in the United Nations by trying to get the Security Council to adopt a resolution er calling er the North Vietnamese aggressors and authorizing er an American, I E U N intervention. This failed. It failed because the French and the British were unhappy about supporting such a move and indeed the United Nations looked very likely er er to be more erm willing to condemn the United States than it was to condemn North Vietnam but the view of most countries in the world at that time was that North Viet that North and South Vietnam were part of the same country, that the Geneva accords in nineteen fifty four which called for unification should be upheld, and that the United States was interfering in, in a south east Asian country for no good reason. So it is a hostile atmosphere and so hostile was it in the United Nations that the Americans decided to cripple it, and what they did was to invoke erm an article which called for the removal of votes from those states who were in, who were in arrears in the payment of their dues, of their, their funds and there were several countries in that category, two of them the Soviet Union and France, and the reason why they had not pal paid their dues was because they objected to the use of the, these funds for peacekeeping forces which had not been authorized by the Security Council, in their argument the Security Council was the, the supreme authority and the General Assembly had in fact not the right to authorize er peacekeeping activities and indeed, if you read the charter, this is the case although legal advice is conflicting on that point as it usually is. Erm well the solution to that was to hold the meetings of the General Assembly, where the hostile American majority was, but not to permit a vote to be taken on any resolution and this meant that President Johnson could pursue his, his then secret plan of bombing the north without any hostile United Nations resolution being passed against it. Two years later the Americans quietly dropped the whole issue and the, the UN returned to normal but by that time of course the situation had become what it was, er er a war. Well limits then, so air, air, air bombardment and the use of some ground forces but principally to, to get er the South Vietnamese army er to contest er the Vietcong on the ground. Well that failed as you would imagine it to fail if you take the civil war in Vietnam as being in effect a, a war of national liberation, as the Soviets called it, because what the North Vietnamese wanted was in fact national unity. They were fighting for an objective which was far more important than local arrangements or local agreements er with er foreign imperial powers about who governed what er in, in their own country. And so they were prepared to go on taking the punishment, taking the cost because their objectives were,ha had a different scale of value to the objectives sought by the United States. Two or three years later with half a million troops they are still no further forward in their struggle in Vietnam and the cost this time was to the United States' political system because the effect upon domestic politics was fairly severe. After the North Vietnamese revealed that they were able to sustain erm a w er their war in er erm the south it seemed regardless of what, what the United States could do to them, er after they'd revealed this in the Tet offensive of nineteen sixty eight, then President Johnson announced he would not be standing for re-election, and that was a significant admission of political defeat and if you remember, well you probably won't remember but you certainly should've read about it, President Nixon was returned with a, a majority er er on the platform of ending the Vietnam war. The casualties I think were something like fifty, fifty seven thousand dead and a very very large number of people wounded because of the particularly beastly kind of war with all kinds of weapons being used. Now why was the United States defeated and was this war a rational war? Well the objective was the maintenance of a friendly regime er in a country which had become part of the American sphere of influence. No one however at the time questioned why it was necessary to do that. What was the significance of keeping South Vietnam in the American fold? No one asked that question, they simply focused upon er the, the communist insurrection in the south and the American, American commitment to the global containment of communism meant that they had to go and do something about it and domestic political pressures were there too er President Kennedy came out of the Cuban missiles crisis a hero because his people mistakenly believed that he'd won a foreign policy success and that he'd acted in a restrained and statesmanlike manor. Well regardless of the hyperbole and the rhetoric, in fact it was an American defeat er he had to accept the existence of a communist regime in Cuba and to keep his hands off it. Now in the case of Vietnam, a decision had to be made to intervene or not to intervene. If they'd not intervened er then indeed the consequences would certainly have been a communist victory so the intervention was necessary to maintain that policy position. What limits would be placed, and Kennedy was very acutely conscious of the big mistake that Truman had made in Korea in, in fact, seeking to extend the intervention and bringing China into the war under no circumstances must China be allowed to take that step in the case of Indo-China. Now this meant that the neutrality of Laos and Cambodia, er the main er route, the main supply route er from China, the, most of the weaponry incidentally came from the, the Soviet Union, China provided the facilities er so under no circumstances could the Americans intervene there, nor could they cross the demilitarized zone in force and erm invade North er Vietnam as they had done with North Korea previously. Now these limits were fatal, they believed that they could win the war through air power and they, they couldn't and the ground casualties, although fairly slight, when you think of it fifty thousand people killed is not a bi a large amount in a major war, far from it erm although erm militarily not that significant, politically they were devastating because people in America started to ask the question, what is this war for? Er and this of course er became er er a major domestic political crisis as well a difficult military situation, a difficult one to win. Now the points I'm making here, firstly we have the problem of separating security from non-security er objectives. We have the problem of defining and keeping er established limits so that the pursuit of a non-security objective does not lead you in to directly erm having to er fight a security war or a total war. Now it's true that since the second world war all wars have been limited in one sense or another, but then comes the question, if you do, in fact, succeed in defining objectives er and de in defining the means to those objectives, how can you know in fact that you possess genuine capability without putting it to the test, without actually fighting the war and then finding that you cannot win it? You can't win it by changing the parameters er if you do change the parameters of course then you'll be fighting a different war and your objectives then become different. Erm the problem of limits then erm is paramount when yo you're contemplating threatening or using violence. Think of the present problem with Bosnia there isn't a single er advanced industrial country that wishes to get engaged in ground warfare in Yugoslavia because there would be simply no point in it and any casualty er would be seen as a waste, as a throwing away of resources and you'd have many casualties it's argued. It's argued that you'd need at least a force of eighty thousand troops, that's in Bosnia. Erm well why would you er get engaged in a, a contest erm with er the three warring factions, because you certainly wouldn't be able to con confine yourself to one, and since there's no national interest as such, I know there have been many attempts to link er Bosnia with er peace in the world generally or with world order, in fact there is no threat er this is a civil war, strictly speaking, and th there's no evidence that it would er sp spill over into a major war unless it was made a major war er by those er with the er forces that exist. Erm so how then do you stop the fighting? How do you secure order? And we now have got the first step er sorry not, not strictly speaking, the first steps of course were economic th that we had a strategic embargo and an economic embargo er on er on the Serbs and er on, on the er the, the different regions er th the first military step however is air strikes and we'll know er within a week I think whether in fact this step will be actually taken or whether the threat is sufficient to induce er the belligerents to come to a negotiated settlement. It's a fairly low risk erm threat at the moment, air strikes are cheap er they're not particularly dangerous whether they're effective or not is another matter, er and there's no immediate come back on the domestic scene because no one is expecting any one state to be the saviour in that particular situation. Er the United States er in, in short, the, the principal er actor here er is immune from criticism because if these strikes fail it's simply er bad luck, erm there's no cost to the United States that can be translated into the domestic er arena and made dangerous to the incumbent president. Er this tells us that domestic political considerations are very important in deciding whether to use er violence or whether to threaten it or, or, or whatever erm so there is er er a domestic political dimension to this which is well worth examining if you wish to understand the limits that actually exist on politicians' powers. Erm secondly erm if you do get engaged in a contest, the consequences of failure should be weighed before you actually get involved. In short if you er ta er taking er Kennedy's decision over Vietnam, if he decided to do nothing, this would have been very damaging to him politically because of the declared er policy of the global containment of communism and the expectations of his domestic public that the United States would take action to defend the free world wherever the free world was challenged without much questioning about what the free world actually was, I mean the fact that er er South Vietnam was run by a rather squalid dictatorship was neither here nor there erm so erm you have to er evaluate when you're contemplating er actions of this kind what failure would mean in domestic political terms. Now Mrs Thatcher certainly did this er when she authorized the Falkland expedition. The consequences of failure there wo would certainly ha have meant her removal from office erm however she did calculate erm that within the limits she set that success would be,wo wo would in fact be the result, and it was. It was a strictly limited operation. The Argentinian mainland was not threatened, er the major erm influences in the region were placated, particularly the United States. The, the force levels were added, were sufficient given the inability of the Argentinian government to reinforce er the Falklands once the action had begun and again the equation of air forces etcetera were, were evaluated. I think she had a fair amount of luck, but luck is always an el element in anything of this kind. Erm the demonstration effect of failure should also be considered, that is if you fail once you've undertaken an enterprise, this will affect your other policy objectives too, that is er you will be seen to be weak, your commitment to intervene on behalf of other allies might be seen to be, to have weakened er and, and generally you, you might have done your, your overall foreign policy stance er some, some considerable damage. Erm the world is indeed inter-related erm we are talking in strategic terms of a multilateral er er erm system just as we, as, when we come to the later lectures we will see, as is the case with economic relations. What a country does in one part of the world reverberates throughout the system. Er there are interests all over an and some er have a higher value er er and some have a lower value but they are all related erm so it's not possible to regard er a contest solely as an isolated advers adversarial struggle where you're weighing up the rel the relative forces, the relative military capabilities that exist, you have to consider a whole range of political, economic and strategic effects of, of your, your, your action. Erm anoth another example of a successful war was of course the Gulf War. Now here again calculation of forces er and er the, the er er conduct of operations was in fact strictly limited. The Iraqi armies were not pursued into their own country, er the attacks made were largely erm the fairly cheap and as we now know fairly ineffective er air strikes and that the main contest was in fact over Kuwait which was indeed the declared objective er of the whole operation. In fact the erm er the, the actual agenda was far more to do with the price of oil than it was to do with er who ruled Kuwait. Erm but the point there is that restraints were observed. Bush said this will be no Vietnam and he well understood and everybody else well understood what he meant by that. Erm the limits, the means, the ends were held in a commensurable relationship and so we have an example, if you like, of a rational war, a war in which the objectives can be er successfully attained er without them changing er and the means held. Well that's as far as I want to go with this, this particular topic, erm as is my practice I'm ending now so that we can have questions. Erm I'm ranging over a lot of what for you perhaps is historical material, given your age, but er you're probably not very familiar erm if you want to ask questions about er detail or whatever please feel free to do so. There are a number of books on contemporary world politics and you've got some recommended er for you to read. Who'd like to ask me a question? Cos I'm not recording this for myself, it's for a, a publisher who wants the department's lectures on tape for some reason. Before we start this morning I'd just like to make one brief announcement er one of my colleagues has asked me to announce er a lecture to be given on Thursday at five fifteen, that is er directly after the second systems lecture of the week, erm on the title of the transition from totalitarianism to democracy, changes, challenges and opportunities in the former Soviet Union and it will be given by the Baroness of Queensbury erm and that's er at fife fifteen, one four one in this er in this building. Thank you. This is the first of er two lectures on the American presidency and erm I want to begin just by putting the presidency in, in context erm thus far I hope it's clear that the American pol political system is one in which authority is firstly limited by the constitution in which authority dispersed by the by virtue of the separation of powers. We know that the congress has the legislative power but the president has a veto. The president, according to the constitution has the executive power that executive power depends to a large part on the willingness of congress to provide the legal framework moments in which there is harmony and cooperation between president and congress tend to be exceptional rather than er a regular feature of the American system and if er the president manages to get something through congress, you can bet that very quickly the president will face some defeat in congress shortly thereafter to remind the president that the United States does not have, contrary to the popular press, does not have a presidential system of government. And what has happened over time is that, in the twentieth century, with the advent of two world wars, with the impact of the worst economic depression that the world's ever seen, with the rise to global dominance, both economic and military, indeed one might say culturally, the rise to global dominance of the United States, the scale and er scope of the U S executive branch has grown and with it an increasing er attention and focus on the presidency. That's understandable and to some extent justifiable but if it creates the impression in anyone's mind that the U S has a presidential system of government er then they would be sadly mistaken. The Am American system is one of, as I've said, a dispersed, limited and shared form of authority and the president is but one actor, and in Reagan's case not a very good one, in that particular er set of arrangements. Okay I think what we've seen in American politics in the last twenty, twenty years or so is a, an in is er an increasing trivialization of politics the er the mass media, the so called er piranhas er focus on the daily lives of presidents. We know much more about the state of Chelsea's teeth than we do about the state of the nation. We know much more than anyone could possibly want to know about Bill and Hillary's sex life er than we do er about prospects for economic recovery and this has happened to successive American presidents and it happens in part because in the U S the president and his family, and it has been a his so far, the president and his family take the part, not only the part played in England by the prime minister, but also the part played by the monarchy. The president is both head of state and head of government and in that capacity serves to some extent as a symbol of the nation, a focus for loyalty and Americans have a curious capacity for er im imputing to whoever wins the presidential election a set of er outstanding qualities. So that every American president is a sort of half breed, a cross between Daniel Boone and Jesus Christ and that however corrupt and venal a politician he might have been before, once he assumes the White House it is assumed that he changes. They talk about people growing in office always worried about people who think that forty seven year old men can grow, but there you are. Er the, the, the office itself, the trappings of the office transform the man. So even someone as obviously corrupt as Richard Nixon, people started talking about the new Nixon, new Nixon the statesman. They stopped saying, you know, would you buy a used car from this man and started talking about him as the international peacemaker. And this means, or this has an impact, this dual role as head of state and head of government, has an impact on what any president can do. Because a very large part of any president's time is taken up in the ceremonial, in the ritual, in meeting heads of states from other countries, from opening the equivalents of garden fetes, receiving parties of boy scouts, er and whatever else the Queen and her family do these days. Er and that means that the president's attention is both diverted from substantive concerns and it also means the president, there's a limitation on the extent to which the president can appear to be partisan. So the president tries to encapsulate the national interest to embody the common good and he puts forward policies, not in any spirit of er personal or partisan advantage, but simply for the good of the nation. And so you have then a political system in which you, which you have a presidency er faced by a powerful legislature, a president who is not part of legislature but who has to lead the legislature without any significant controls over it a very difficult and demanding task. Erm one of the best known commentators on the American president, a man called Richard Newstat er who's occasionally known as Mr Williams because he's married to er Shirley Williams a clapped-out Social Democratic politician of er yesteryear, erm Richard Newstat once said, well once said many things but er on this particular occasion said that er if you want to know what presidential power is, it is simply the power to persuade and that er when you look for er an American president what you need to look for er is not somebody who is clear minded, far sighted and so on but you need somebody who has the capacity the skill, the talent, to persuade other people to do what he wants them to do. It has to be persuasion because he has few, if any, powers of coercion unlike the British prime minister. Okay well if we look into the development of the presidency what we've seen is a gradually changing conception of the office. Er I said I think in the first lecture, the founding fathers saw the presidency as a check, as a control on the legislature er and er in periods of crisis legislatures find it very difficult to respond. Any group of five hundred and thirty five people find it difficult to agree on a common purpose or a common decision and increasingly, in period of crisis, attention turned to the presidency and presidents were not always willing to supply the leadership er that er the country expected. Erm presidents of the nineteenth century very often took the view that the president was not much more than a sort of constitutional monarch, er a dignified part of the constitution to use er Bagehot's phrase. Erm in the eighteen fifties, in the years immediately preceding the American civil war, the er then American president er was placed under great pressure to do something about the increasing tensions and increasing conflicts between north and south but er he declined to do so. Does anyone remember the president before Abraham Lincoln? Not many people do. Erm his name James Buchanan James Buchanan was asked to do something about the violations of the Fugitive Slave Law, this is the one that returned slaves back to their owners, erm and Buchanan said, I quote wisely limited and restrained as is the president's power under our constitution, he alone can accomplish but little for good or for evil on such a momentous question. After all he is no more than the chief executive officer of government, his province is not to make but to execute the laws. Congress alone has the power to decide whether the present laws can or cannot be amended so as to carry out more effectively the objects of law. Apart from the execution of the laws the executive has no authority to decide what shall be the relations between the federal government and South Carolina, any attempt to do this would be on his part a naked act of usurpation . So you have a very particular view of the constitution, that given by the founding fathers and one which is still in force some seventy eighty years later as America headed towards its most momentous and divisive crisis in its history. Now this is a turning point in, in American history and er cometh the time cometh the man and the man in this case was Abraham Lincoln and Abraham Lincoln took a rather, a rather different line. And I shall quote to you from er a message of Lincoln's to congress in eighteen sixty one and from some of his er private correspondence. if you remember the question that the founding fathers faced was how do you create a government which is strong enough to endure and to defend the nation and defend the country yet a government which is not so strong that it erodes the rights of individuals within it, this is the, the essence of the, the problem of government as, as the founding fathers saw it. During the er civil war Abraham Lincoln er suspended, unilaterally, without consultation, er suspended the writ of habeas corpus who knows what habeas corpus is? Right to a fair trial, any, any advance on that? We must have one lawyer amongst our presence surely. Mhm. It literally, it literally means produce the body only you can't simply, well the difference between a constitutional system and er an arbitrary government is that in arbitrary governments people get arrested and disappear, locked up, throw away the key and worry about it the next generation or after the next er military coup or whatever but in a constitutional government there have to be procedures and one of the safeguards of individual liberty is that if you're ever arrested and detained by law enforcement agencies you have to be produced before a court within a specified period and charged with something. There has to be evidence produced to say why you are being detained and you have a chance to, to refute that evidence. Er as you can imagine in the circumstances of the civil war the government, the federal government, was much vexed about the question of spies and fifth columnists and people er in the, in the northern states er engaged in sabotage and collecting espionage of, of various kinds so er Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus. There were arrests, people were detained er without trial, they weren't charged with anything but on suspicion of being spies for the confederacy. And Lincoln was criticized, attacked for this, that er and he said in response to this the attention of the country has been called to the proposition that one who is sworn as the constitution says to take care that the laws be faithfully executed should himself not violate those laws a fairly reasonable proposition you might think, if your oath says to uphold the law then you start going round breaking the law er something wrong here somewhere methinks. He goes on to say of course federal laws were not being obeyed in the confederacy because they'd rejected the entire panoply of federal laws and Lincoln goes on to point out must they these laws and the confederacy be allowed to to state the question more directly, are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the government itself to go to pieces less that one be violated . So you get the impression here of Lincoln talking about an unusual crisis situation in a letter to one of his mates in eighteen sixty four Lincoln goes on Lincoln goes on to, in his letter to a friend to deny that civil war was fought to, to free the slaves er as a moral crusade, he wants no part of that argument. Lincoln says in a letter to his friend er Hodges in eighteen sixty four, quote I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong and yet I have never understood the presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling and I aver that to this day I have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on slavery. I did understand however that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of that nation of which the constitution is the organic law. Was it possible rhetorical question was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution ? Now here we move in to a bit of Plato always be aware of those who argue by analogy by general law life and limb must be protected yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life can you guess what's coming next?but a life is never wisely given to save a limb . Pretty acute stuff eh? I felt and this is the bit I like, I, I some I, I used to set this at one point in the examination question and ask people to guess which American president said it I'll read, I'll read it to you measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful if indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation just, I'll just get the essence of that,measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful if indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation ninety percent put Richard Nixon er no one put Abraham Lincoln er cos he was one of the good guys right or wrong I assume this ground I could not feel that to the best of my ability I had even tried to preserve the if to save James Buchanan is essentially the Pontius Pilate of American politics he says yes these are very acute problems er and very difficult er and I'd like to help but I'm sorry I can't and I really do have to go off and wash my hands now erm and, you know, you carry on and when you've resolved it tell me what you want me to do and I'll, I'll do it. Lincoln takes the opposite view, Lincoln says here is a crisis the person uniquely placed to deal with major crises in American politics is the president and I, Abe Lincoln, stand forward and I'm prepared to do almost anything if in my judgment it's necessary to preserve the nation and the constitution. So from a view of the president as impotent and ineffective and helpless you have a view of the president as being er the action man, the crisis manager and it's Lincoln's view, the Linc Lin Lincolnian view of the presidency which has survived er an and developed with, with the odd, the odd hark back to a previous, a previous age. And you find successive presidents er claiming some special authority that the constitution doesn't give them but which they, they believe that er a accrues to them by virtue of they're being presidents. One of my favourite presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, president from the early part of the twentieth century and known as the damned cowboy erm you might be interested to know how people become president erm Theodore Roosevelt was an arch imperialist and got very excited about the er war with Spain er America had a s little brief war with Spain at the end of the nineteenth century erm over the possession of Cuba, and erm in eighteen ninety eight, and this aroused great patriotic feelings in all red blooded Americans and especially in Theodore Roosevelt and er er Roosevelt formed his own company of cavalry called the Rough Riders and erm Roosevelt wore glasses and was asthmatic but he had this group called the Rough Riders, sort of early kind of Clint Eastwood stuff, and erm anyway he g he was engaged in the war with Spain er and there was one wonderful moment in the war Spain in which the Spaniards were at the top of a hill called the San Juan hill er and er Teddy, as he was known, of course he gave his name to the teddy bear, did you know that did you? You learn something every day in these lectures. Er Teddy Roosevelt down at the bottom with the Rough Riders the guns at the top of the hill, the horses at the bottom of the hill you've heard of the charge of the Light Brigade haven't you? They were smart guys compared to Teddy Roosevelt. Er Teddy Roosevelt leads a charge of horses up hill, up hill, into the mouth of the Spanish guns smart guy, smart move how did he become president after doing something as fatuous as this? Well fortunately the Spanish were even more incompetent than he was and what the Spanish commander, instead of rubbing his hands at the prospect of er the damage they were about to wreak, he discovered that they had the wrong calibre shells for their guns and Roosevelt and the Rough Riders overran the Spanish guns a and Teddy Roosevelt became a war hero and on the strength of becoming a war hero, he become vice president of the United States, got the vice presidential nomination and in good American fashion the president was shot er by an assassin er and Teddy Roosevelt became president, so there you are, there's a there's a career plan for you to er to think about. Erm Roosevelt was er despite the er rather unusual route to the presidency, really rather a good president but he had a, he had a very particular view of the presidency which was one which he shared with Lincoln but he took up Lincoln's arguments and, and developed it further and I quote from er Roosevelt's autobiography, which is rather more revealing than most autobiographies, erm Roosevelt wasn't modest I should say in case you, if you wonder when I read you something. He says in the autobiography erm my view was that every president was a and this was a famous phrase every president was a steward of the people, a steward of the people, bound actively and affirmatively to do all he could for the people and not to content himself with the negative merit of keeping his talents undamaged in a napkin curious turn of phrase I decline he says to adopt the view that what is imperatively necessary for the nation cannot be done unless the president can find some specific authorization to do it in the constitution. I did and caused to be done many things not previously done by the president. I did not usurp power but I did greatly broaden the use of executive power, in other words this is the modesty part I acted for the public welfare, I acted for the common wellbeing of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was necessary unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative prohibition Roosevelt suggested that the president subject only to the people of the United States and he identified himself with Andrew Jackson and with Abraham Lincoln. To Roosevelt the view propounded by our friend James Buchanan was narrowly legalistic in which the president was the servant not of the people but of congress and this, to Roosevelt, was . So you get, if you like, a development here er of presidential authority and the perception of the presidency both from the point of view of incumbents and from the point of view of the American people and gradually in the twentieth century you get an increasing focus an increasing focus on the presidency as the engine of government, that it's the president who makes things happen, it's the president who fixes things, it's the president who responds to crises and as the crises become more frequent and the crises become more intense so the focus on the president also expands and the Buchanan view is now no longer tenable, the Buchanan view it's not possible for any president to play the dignified monarch. They like to do it a bit but they really can't sustain it because ultimately there's a, there's a call for action, a demand for action. In the twentieth century er the president who did most to, to develop the office further was, was Franklin Roosevelt, Theodore's cousin er and Franklin Roosevelt, who became president in, in the nineteen thirties and the time of the great depression, and remained president for, till nineteen forty five so He was president for thirteen years er and his political opponents were so upset by this that they actually amended the constitution afterwards to prevent any future president from serving more than two terms of as president, so eight years is the maximum that anyone can serve as president. Roosevelt served for thirteen years and led America through the depression, into the second world war and emerging at the other end as Oh well there was clothes and gardens and and just the same as it is now. But oh that's where the Was it the Clydesdale bank that's at the top of Castle Street? Mhm. That was and that was a grand shop. We used to all wear pinnies, white pinnies, on the top of our dresses and going to school and I used to go into old Mr n and he would say to me And what colour of the bow do you want on your pinny today? And I would say He'd wait for me to say, Blue to match my eyes. Just as a kid he would lift me up on the m up on the er counter, you know and me I was born in and then we shifted to the bottom, you know that white house, I think it's all offices now, in the the erm big gates of the cathedral. You know at the bottom of the market green. Well the house, you just went in a gate there and went up the stairs there. So it was just My mother used to see me across the road with my shilling to pay for my pinny. And one day I dro I dropped it down the the drain as I went into the shop. And I tears of course, you know, and er the poor old man he was a very small man, Mr , and er he lifted me up and told me never to mind, i could get another shilling. But I don't know whether I ever got . Or whether I got the pinny for nothing, I might have easy. Yes? Did you have to have a different pinny every day then? Oh very nearly. Oh yes, but they were just things that you tied at the back and and er had a frilled round here They were bonny. On the top of your dress. And what was the pinny for? Oh just dress. You were dressed in a clean one, you had a clean pinny on. You know, just a thing with sleeves and and er han hang loose on you. You've seen pi pictures of that surely. Was that to keep the dress clean?

Yeah, if you want a hedge six, if you want a hedge six foot high, a good solid hedge six foot high, plant eighteen inches apart, so I've had, I've planted them between twenty and twenty two inches apart They take years to grow No they don't How long? Er, they reckon they grow two to three foot a year they're the fast grow ones, once they get a hold, they start growing and they shoot up each week and when they start shooting up, that's when, you've got to keep them watered, and you've got to feed them with that plant stuff do you know what I mean? Yeah Got the old watering can and then you get down on this plant, and then when they get a gist of that first time that they go whooo, you wake up in the morning, you've got co , conifers like Jack and The Beanstalk coming I was gonna come over and see you about, about Mm, mm. I could find out where you did your, that, that hall, I know people in know where it is in it? Yeah, but that, I don't know whether it's knew anything See I told you they would No I don't think so, nobody does What, what did they say about your tash? Do you know, I went in there right and the majority of people never took no blind bit of notice then suddenly one person walked through the door, you know, he's always playing next to me and he sits down, puts his trumpet there, gets his trumpet on ya, sits there, turns round and the next thing he were laying on the floor going and that was it, everybody else turn round and oh, blah, blah, blah, blah and that's how it goes and that that actor oh blimey he's we say no, what does he remind me of? And going oh he looks like a bloody poofter know ooh, ooh and then that was it and then a bit later on, that was all they said about me haircut and then during the break somebody else said, there's something else gone as well and they couldn't make out what it what done mine in, my musical director he come, he says you know what will look nice now with that haircut don't you? I said what? He said a patch, I went I said little one, he said no I've never noticed never noticed you had it? no I can't believe it's Thursday So you've got plenty of food on you? Yeah, I see, you could possibly for a fiver I think Ah? I think er, that Same with my missus, don't get suspicious I know she thinks I'm picking you up, but,I and Mark are gonna give you some money for I said yeah, he is, I said he could do where do you think you're going, I said London You always tell her diary. Okay. We can't do it next Saturday because erm we've got two people, a Scotsman married to a Chinese Yes. coming to spend Saturday. Mm. So that's a dead day for next week. And might be able to do it before the weekend perhaps Yeah think so, I'm just when does Noel get back from London? Erm hoping Monday evening. He's going to see Mr . He has a little bit of a scratchiness in one of his eyes Mm? erm and phoned up and sort of semi made an appointment, not exactly Mhm. erm because Mr was abroad and the girl said well I mean come in on Monday, when he'll be back Mm. and he may be able to see you then. Yeah. So come Monday morning, Sunday night in fact, Noel said gosh I can this is, this seems to have gone light. We've got some ointment from the doctor which didn't work last time he put it out Mm. and seems to have worked this time. So he said I can't go along and bother a busy man when it's feeling much better. Mm. So erm he didn't go Mm. but he got a phone call on the Tuesday from Mr 's secretary to say oh Mr would like to see you anyway because er he feels it may have erm it was a letter, I'm sorry, which came Mm. in case it has any bearing on any difficulty you might have in the future so he's to go down So he's got an appointment? Mm Monday morning. And then he's going to call at Sotherby's. Do you know Sotherby's are the most dilettante people you've ever come across, they really are. Mm. With the exception of the one erm section leader that he deals with normally. At the beginning of this week a girl phoned up and said that erm the chap he normally deals with is away Mm. but there's an organ is Sussex they want him to look at and erm so he said well send me a photograph er they've got a photograph of it you see Mm. send the photograph and that gives me an idea whether it's worth going to look at it at all. That I think was about Tuesday. Mhm. It never came. This is what they do, they phone up asking They could have they could have even faxed it. Mm well we haven't got a fax. Oh no. But the thing is, what they do tend to do is, they suddenly find themselves in a panic because they've behaved like this about it and the person at the other end is shouting when are you coming to see this organ Mm. I was talking about how dilatory S er Sotherby's are. Oh. Yes but I know the thing dear no Well of course they're not, they're not in a businesslike business are they? No not really, no. And I wonder if it seems to be that they prefer you come out of the upper drawer than come up with your brilliant A levels or whatever. They do, yes. Mm. Exactly that. Mm. They are erm a very, you know one, one of the last bastions where those sort of people can find a refuge. Yes. I suppose so. I find them You know,l like, like the Duke of Kent's daughter. Mm. Does she work there? She works in art galleries or, or some art gallery Or some art gallery. Yeah. Mm. And the man she's marrying is an art gallery. So he is. That's right. So he is. there has to be space for these people though somehow I always feel that they cream it all the same. Mm I think they do cream it, yes. Oh that's Well du during next week is what we think Noel. Pardon? During next week erm I'm just trying to think, I've got very heavy days on Monday and Tuesday so Wednesday's a possibility then in that case. Er let's shall, can we leave it open? Mhm, certainly. And then we'll arrange it with you, mm? Yes. Erm I don't know whether I think post rather erm er I see I'm not going to London after erm after this week Ooh. Oh you're going to be making some of your special coffee are you love? I am indeed. Ooh er How's your barn proceeding? Don't know, it doesn't seem to be doing anything and what the was that during the week when was in residence one night the dogs barked and he went out to see what was happening and there was a young man who worked in it this was in the pitch dark, was up there taking some of his stuff away. Oh. Oh. So I wonder. Has he run out of cash? Well, I wouldn't be surprised. Why would he need to do it in the dark? Well if for instance it's approaching receivership Oh oh oh you'd want to sort of, you know Mm. Oh yes. get your stuff and you'd want it not to be obvious that you'd got your stuff. Oh I see, yes. But that's, that's only a guess though I don't know. you mean the young man who actually owns it or the man who's employed working on it? Well I don't know who exactly owns it Yes. but the man who has been doing the work there who said he owned it Oh I know, oh. But the, the lady who was erm what's her name daughter, she used to live in the erm erm live in the terraced house erm What Jo ? Mrs what? you mean? No er the people before them. The ? What? The ? yes, Ann 's daughter Mhm. who's got the farm up at Mhm. and there's a there's a farm for sale opposite there, you never saw such a wreck in all your life. Oh it is a wreck. Yes. Yes it really is. Yes. I think the vogue is dying isn't it? Yes. Erm they're being much stricter about what you can do to them. Erm. And how you do it perhaps. And how you do it and everything, yes. I think that erm across the road from me he's just mucked around. Yes. He hasn't done things in the sort of, you know, the preferred way. That was the sign from the beginning wasn't it? Yes. And he hasn't had building inspections at the right sorts of times. Ah. So I think he's going to find himself in a lot of trouble. That's good. Mm. Well he didn't, he did deserve it didn't he, really? Yep. But he paid dearly for it in the first place didn't he? I think it's such a shame that he's gone and put that wretched wirenetting fence so close to the road I agree. across the road from me. That what? Wirenetting fence across the road. Yes it is wretched. Cos it's so close to the road, it doesn't give me any swinging round room Well actually if he's on my side of the road. If he's having problems Mm? you may be able to get that rectified mayn't you? Ya. And say yes Better arrange for the coal lorr lorry to back in to it one day. Ya I was I've been thinking of trying to have a big delivery of something. I mean I would do you er have ? I don't have any coal delivered unfortunately. Oh. I've go I've got some coal in the coal shed and it, you know,i it sort of lasts me. Oh. I never seem to run out. Because if you had old er what's his name? Don . Don , 's man er if you explained the bother Mhm. er he would back his with a little encouragement from me he'd back his lorry right into it and flatten it for you. Darling he's a very nice man. I know he is, that's why he'd do it. Well unfortunately if, if I did have a delivery of coal it would come in through the other entrance. Oh that needn't prevent you from backing in er backing into it when he turns round. No it's been, it's been a tough week this last week. Oh dear. I'm sorry. I feel very sorry for people who have to work for their living now, I really do. Mm. Yes. Oh we've got something else have we? I thought Yes we've got a little bit of Israel haven't you? A bit of Israel? Yes. We had a box of oranges sent to us from Israel Oh I see direct to me Mm. friends of ours there. Actually it's George 's son. Mhm. My wife's Hello Ian, oh I was hoping that you'd come and see us. Yes. That's wonderful. to see you. I'm just getting, will you tea? Yes, I'd love one. Thank you. Right I'll just get that. Well how are things going? Yes business okay Mm no No? Oh dear dear dear not at all, no. Is old alright? Just about yes yes. That must be worrying, a lot of people feel like that don't they? Yes. No it's, it's been a very bad eighteen months er Oh dear. cos the, the business that I was What? the business I was a director of Yes? er last year went into receivership Oh lord. in January Ooh. Now does that have a er I, I know you lose the income but does it, does it penalize you at all? Yes it does. Oh dear. Yes. Yeah we've had er the D T I investigating Oh lord. cos it was quite a big company. Oh. But erm it just er hopefully because yeah but really they're just trying to investigate to make sure that we didn't act fraudulently in any way. Oh yes. Oh good. I mean I don't suppose Which, which we didn't. You know it was the it was the downturn that erm Yes, ooh you know that started nineteen nineteen ninety one. What was the business what er did you do? In, in advertising. Advertising oh yes. An advertising agency. Oh. Yeah. But about a third of the top agencies in our sector all went bust in Good god. in the last eighteen months. Cos living up here privately in retirement one doesn't realize these things. I mean er unemployment in er white collar management area is, is, is very marked now. Is it? Yeah it's yes. Yes it's really affect affected our, our businesses. There's so many areas that have contracted so much. Yes and i it's a, it's long erm It is, yes. process Yes. Affects everything. But, you know, things are going okay. But you, you managing just, just to hold on Just about yes. Yeah. Cos as you know Ben's in Hong Kong Yes?yes. He's suddenly swapping from the police to er security in a big bank. Oh fascinating. Oh. Erm I, I suppose it'll be a couple of years before he does that but Well, yes. yes. Cos he signed up for five, five years didn't he? He signed up for three years with an option Mm to do another two. Oh I see, yes. And I think he's going to work out the other two and then go on to this forget the name of it at the moment, this bank Mm. and er but he doesn't want to come back to England. No I was sorry I missed him when he came over last year. Last year, yes. I just had a quick phonecall with him. Oh he did speak to you? Yes. Yes that's right mm Yes. Yes see that time went like lightning. Yes. Such a shame. Edmund is still in his job. Aha. He still hasn't got naturalization but he seems to be fairly erm fairly secure. He's a journalist of course. Yes. Is he confident that he'll get the naturalization? Oh yes, eventually he will. Right. Yes. W will that be this year or does it take much longer? You can never tell Really? never tell, a girl we know went over at the same time as he did got it this year. Really? But er it's just the luck of the draw, it all depends upon the temper of the particular official that's handling it I think. Yes. I'll give you a funny article he wrote before you go. Oh I'd like to see that. But er I'm just trying to think now er Ben er the trouble with it is, Edmund can't leave the country whilst he's in a job until he gets naturalization because he's got to get a work permit and an entry permit and everything all the way through Right. and again er with the present state of unemployment in America it's unlikely he would get it. It's very difficult. Yes. But he, he managed to get his extension to his permit because he had these English connections and the paper he was on reckoned that he was very valuable to them and so they Good. they held him. Good. Well I'm sure he's Are your wife and family well? Yes. They're happy with you are they? Yes they are, yes. I wouldn't er bestow them er on you even for a short visit though. Oh don't be silly. The er the s the small one is er Oh you've got two have you? Yes he's a real handful. Is he? Oh dear dear Yes. dear dear. Yeah he's er he's nearly two and it's a er they're trying times. I've had it five times. Yes. We're expecting another one in June. Are you really? You That'll be that'll be the third. But I had five. Every Yes. one I said was the last but it . Oh I see certainly feel that er we must be mad. We must be mad. And you're living in Chiswick? Yes, yes. Although we'll have to sell that house. Would you? What because of the financial position? Yes. Oh dear oh dear So er we'll have to wait we're, we're er we've put an offer in, in on a house in Weybridge Oh yes? in Surrey. Erm not particularly because we, we wanted to go to Weybridge but er Cos travelling's expensive isn't it? It is actually. Fifteen hundred pounds for twenty five minutes' journey to Waterloo. But it's got a huge garden which with the two boys I think will be marvellous. Oh yes. It's very unusual for a even in a, a suburban er Yes. area. Huge garden. I know Weybridge slightly. Do you? Oh. Mm. Erm but will you make, be able to make much profit on the on your old Chiswick house to be able to buy the Weybridge one, will that be an economic move? Erm we save quite a lot er which is what we're trying to do, yes. Oh good, yes. Erm and it's er it's a good area for schools It is a good area for schools, mm. a a and er it's you know a reasonable community As a matter of fact I knew an old couple that ran a, had a nursery school there, a big one and a very successful one. Yes I imagine it, it would be. For a number of years they did have but er It's a shame about le leaving Hounslow where Chiswick is Yes. because they provide nursery places. And Yes. so Thomas who's three is at school. Oh yes. Whereas Surrey doesn't until they're five. Oh dear. So we'll have to put them Even if they don't you can sometimes find that if you get behind the scenes that there is a way of doing it. Yes. Yes. Got to spin a hard luck story, something of that sort. Yeah. Yes. But erm we're very lucky where we are. The state schools are very good. Are they, in Chiswick? They do seem very good. Very pleased with them. But erm it's difficult living in London now. The erm you really are aware, I don't know if you get up to London much? Do occasionally, yes. Yes but the erm the atmosphere Oh I hate London, it's awful. Chris Christmas day I had a real chest erm and mouth and everything. I can quite believe it. And it's erm it's so oppressive and we really worry about it with the children. Yes well I can see that, mm. I er I very much dislike London. We've got, still got a little house there Yes. and er so it gets sort of At the organ works? Yes. Yeah. It's a bolt hole Mhm. but I very seldom use it. Yes. How, how's the er organ business going? They're up to their eyes in work. Plenty of Really? of work. Mm. Good. Lot of it export. Good. Ian do you have milk in your tea? Just milk, that'll be Just lovely. yes right. Yes. No sugar? No thank you. Oh good lad. Oh yes John s came back from Japan Really? They, he built a large organ university of or Yes, yes. And er he was back there ten days ago for some or other to see another customer and when he came, only got back into the country on Monday or Tuesday Aha. beginning of this week and then today I've had a letter from an architect friend in America suggesting he gets in touch with an architect in for another job Yes, yes. I'm taking it down to him tomorrow. But he's he's got work in there to come. He's going to build a new organ for Chelmsford cathedral. Oh that's good A new one for St John's College Cambridge, he's really quite busy. Good. Good well I'm pleased that er business is strong. Oh yes he's alright. Yes. Well Ian and how are you doing? Oh not too bad. Keeping fit Really? anyway. Yes. You're keeping fit? That's good. He said he didn't bring the children because he thought that we were too old for them. I think we're, I'm too old for my children, well the smallest one. How lovely. Harry is a a nightmare. He's a real Is he? handful. Yes. He's a handful is he? Oh dear. I'm just going to pour you a Right. I w I was letting it Thank you. er brew a little bit just to Yes that's fine for you. You're looking very fit anyway. Oh that's kind of you. Well we keep busy don't we darling? Ya. And erm we just love it here of course Mm. so we've got nothing to grumble about at all really. Ian was saying how Good. he's moving out of London t to Weybridge or hoping to. Hoping to. You are? Yes. Oh are you? Yeah. That'll be nice. I, I think so. Yes. It's not it's not out of choice entirely because er the business that I was has, has gone very very badly over the last eighteen months Do you mean that type of business or that particular firm? Both. Oh. Yeah. But the particular firm I was a director of went into receivership Oh dear. beginning of last year, it was about Oh that's a year ago now and erm so er I mean fortunately it was bought er as a going concern Good. erm but everyone's financial position er suffered as a result. Yes. Mm. So I'm not as, on as good a contract. You're not? No. No. But them I'm lucky to have have a job really. Well I mean these were the kind of jobs that weren't replaceable weren't they really? Well In a slump. yes that's it. I mean there's so little business around that erm That's right. so It was, it was somewhat a good thing that somebody was prepared to buy it. Yeah. Now I'll pull this forward a bit erm Ian Sorry is this your seat? and no it isn't, no no no, not at all. Now I'm going to leave those there Yes. Alright and you'll just dive in to those won't you? Oh lovely thank you. That's the thing. I'm going to sit quite near to you because I can hear better when I do. Right. So. Erm so this means that the house that you were so er happy with and have you continued to be happy with it? Yes. Erm in er forgotten In Chiswick. In Chiswick Yes. that's right. Aha. So you've got to leave that now? Yes. Yes. Mm But Well this is life when you're young. i i it is really. Yeah I mean we we're fatalistic about it, it's I, I think it is only a, a phase. Yes. Things will change. Yes. I'm sure we've learnt er I've learnt er business er er secures as a result of it Yes. erm so positive about it. Yes. It's the only way to be really isn't it? Well yeah yes. Have you got a house ready for you in erm Weybridge? Well we're buying it from an ol elderly chap Mm. erm he's been in it twenty years and er he's had it on the market for some time. It m probably not as long as a year but it's quite a while Mm. er and he's accepted our offer Good. but he doesn't seem actually willing to move out Oh er which I can understand really. You, one gets very fond of a house really. I think he's he's split up with his wife Oh. although he must be sixty odd erm and it's obviously a very difficult time for him. Yes. Erm so he's keeping us in limbo really Yes. which is a bit infuriating cos er Alison's due our third in My! at the end of June Oh. so er we have to be decided either way yes. by then. Yes. Oh we're quite happy to rent for a while. I was going to say that's the alternative I suppose Yes, yes to, yes. yes And you might even have to do this er for an interim period or something Yes until he decides Can you get yes. places to rent alright? Yes you can actually, yes. Yes. Mm yes, do help yourself Ian. Erm so where would he be meaning to go if he does let you He wants to move down to a smaller house in Weybridge. Yes. Er which we're told shouldn't be difficult to find. Er no no. So erm, you know, hopefully that will be the case. Mm. But erm I don't think he er realizes how difficult it is No. to set up No. a move and that really he's quite fortunate to have a buyer somewhere within the price he wanted. Indeed. Cos we've all you know, we've all not got as much for our houses as we want No that's very true. That's true. Mm. Oh well let's hope that he will. I mean the thing is at the age of sixty he has no conception of what it's like to be your age at this period. Mm. Well, you know, he hasn't bought a hou sold a house within the last ten years Mhm mm which we've done a number of times Yes. and it's not a pleasant it's a very stressful business. I'm sure I'm sure it is. I don't know how we escaped it so much but we have you see. Because we lived on the business, that was Mm. er a foregone conclusion and we never sought to move from there until he retired did we? Mm. No. So one doesn't know er exactly what it's like to do it. No. No. Mm. Gosh. And tell us about the children, how old are they? Harry is erm he'll be two in June Mhm. then Thomas will be four in August. Oh I see, so they're nice spaces. Yes there'll be two years between all of them. Yes. Yes. So which Alison feels is erm er you know the right sort of time Ideal really. for her Yes. which is obviously important. Yes. And erm they haven't had Thomas doesn't remember not having Harry around That's nice. whereas we've got friends who've got older children well a little bit there's, yeah, three or four years between Mm. and they get er old enough to be er quite er happy that they're on you know,c centre of attention Exactly. which er Thomas hasn't. It sours the relationship a bit. Yeah it does a bit. Yes aha. Mm. Ah well I I is this going to be, if it's a boy is this going to be a Benjamin? I don't know actually. could be. you've got two boys Mhm. and so the last of the tribe. Oh the last of the tribe. Yes. Well I think I think you know what I mean. Mm. Erm that's what we did finally in desperation with Ben wasn't it? You decided to He was five, number five . Erm it would be nice to have a little girl then now wouldn't it Mm really? I'd, it's funny because I always wanted a girl Mm. but now I, I wouldn't know, I don't feel I'd know what to do Mm well this is just how Ruth was. Yes got no choice. Mm. No that's right. This is what Ruth er felt cos she had two boys Mm. but erm and she thought I shan't know how to deal with a girl at all Mhm. which is a funny thing for a woman to think isn't it? Well Alison feels the same, yes Does she? Yes, yes she does. Yeah. It is odd isn't it? But And then she had Oh, oh she adores her, and of course she said it's wonderful, I don't have to keep struggling to get boys out of their trousers. Yes. This of course is passing now because the girl's Yes. four isn't she Noel? Four and Really? Gosh she'll be five in April and that's the youngest one. Oh. And er, oh here they are Mm. and er she said it was lovely to be able to put her in dresses. Mm. That's the first day at school Oh lovely. for Catherine. Mhm. She, they all go to the same school. Oh lovely. That's nice isn't it? children, yes it's great. Mm. So Ruth I think as far as, barring accidents, will regard that as being her final Right. They live in Wells Oh do they? in Somerset. Mm. Yes. Oh lovely. I don't know that area but And they no they're very happy there . So that's them. And I gather John's doing well. Yes John is doing well, he's got three children too. He's ooh Yes and his are lots the other way round Aha. erm a boy first and then two girls. Well he's got three too. Nice kids. Yes. Mm yes nice kids. Mm. And of course Margaret's not erm inclined for marriage, she loves her job. No, yeah. And erm I think she'll be she'll, she'll probably stay single unless Mhm she meets some nice old man. Yeah. Wh and where's Margaret working? She's now at erm one of the girls public day school trust schools in Sydenham. Oh. Sydenham High School. Mm. Sydenham High School For Girls. Her dream really is to be teaching at City of London School Mm. And erm I'm ho we're hoping that she might Mm. get a job there. But she loves her work doesn't she Noel? Very secure. And she And your mother seems keeping quite well. Yes, yes she is. She had a bad er flu over Christmas when she was due to come and she's still got a very bad chest Mm. Oh I'm sorry to hear that, oh. but er That's the bit that hangs on always Yes. isn't it? Mm. Yes I saw her, I went up to I went to keep fit with her Oh you did? Good. and er Good. although I didn't last Tuesday, I did the Tuesday before and she seemed Mhm to be getting back on her feet alright. Mm. Ah She says she's much better Mm. And what about Hamish? Mhm. Doing fine? Mm. Finding it quite difficult to get work but erm he was over at Christmas for a short time. Oh yes. I don't think And I saw him we saw him did we? No. Well he wasn't here very long No. but er they've got, they've se set up their own teaching business Oh, have they? and again because of the recession over there le learning English is, is one of the things that, you know, gets put, put back on the It's not a priority. priority yes. Mm. Mm. So erm but they se they seem to be working out okay. Mm. They've taken somebody else on so things can't be that bad Have they? Yeah. Oh good. Mhm. er Alec is a re another real handful. Is he? He's a year younger than Thomas but he was the same height Mm. and er sort of wild curly hair and Oh really? Yes. real wild Isn't that funny? but lovely, lovely boy yeah. Yes, yes but, but lively. Yes. Mm. Very much so. Is that the only child they have at the present time? Yes. Yes. Mhm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. All they can cope with I think. And of course he'll be bilingual. Well he is. Mm. He's quite slow as a result, which is quite common apparently Is it? with er children who are brought up with both languages. Mm. Mm. Erm bec they don't speak either very well to start off with. And how old is he did you say? He's two and a half Oh well it's early. It's such an advantage to them later on I think. Oh well a absolutely yes. Mm. Er he because Toni, Hamish's wife Mm is half French so Is she? I'm, I'm sure he'll her pick up Get three. Trilingual. Yes. Cos they spend quite a lot of time, they spend their holidays in France. Yes. So I'm sure that confuses him even more at this stage. Mm. Course it does. Yeah. Yes but in the end it does seem to work. I was always a bit doubtful about it Mm. erm er you know, whether it could vu confuse children or not but in fact it doesn't seem to with John's children does it? No no. His They use his wife is German. Yes. Yes. Mhm. And they use both languages quite freely. Mm. In fact she gets rather uptight because erm during the year at school when they're speaking English most of the time Yes. which is very natural, and so she ships them off to Germany to the relatives To put them straight. Aye That's quite right I think because it is a good, good thing. That's right. Well it is. I wo I won't thanks. Will you have another one? No thank you. Well help yourself then if you want one. Mm. But Yes. of course the, the, the slump is also, not the slump, the recession is also er operative in Italy is it? Yes. It's everywhere. Ian why do people It's worldwide. Well make such a fuss about it erm I mean politically? Well, yes well I suppose it's Everybody's having to cope with it. coming up to an election time and Of course. everyone er They're bound to use it. bound to use anything they can Mm. er any angle they can get, get a grip of. Yes. But er yes, no it is th I mean they had a lot of business from banks and areas like that Yes. which of course have lost a lot of money in the last year or two. That's right of course. They have, they will be drawing back on most things. Yeah. But in fact they're the people aren't they who need bilingual people on the staff? Yes they are. They're much, much better. I mean y er you know, although they're in recession I, I think there's you know in this country Mm. we we're owned now, our company, by a French agency group and erm none of our directors are, are learning French. Isn't it extraordinary. And yet you've got people who run restaurants, small businesses of that sort erm just general businessmen who want, you know, know they have to speak English. Mm. And they're just doing it as a matter of course over there. Yes. They all seem to have more drive than our people, what's the matter with us? It's certainly in the, in that area, it's the cosmopolitan business Mm. attitude er and also it's complacency because we can Yes. you can get away with it. You know all the meetings That's right. are held in English. Mm. Mm. And er the French speak very good English Mm. erm so there's, there's not enough incentive there. No. And I have to say that er I don't. But I, I, I I ou really I, I know I'll have to be thrown into the situation of having to do it You'd better get on with it and do it now. Yes. But of course the beauty of it is you've done it at school haven't you? Yes. And once you've done it at school, it comes back with a bit of an effort quite quickly. Yeah I've got a reasonable vocabulary Yes. Yes. but never really spoken it at all. I mean we never did any French trips. Didn't you? was useless for languages when I was there. Was it? Yes absolutely hopeless. We never did any trips of that nature at all actually. And what was the teaching system? Er had they by the time you were still at school come on to that new erm er system where you speak a lot more? No. No. You've done it out of grammar books? Yes. Mm. Yes. I remember Mm. it was, yeah vocabulary tests and that sort of thing which Mm. Mm. you know er well it's er it's a middle ages approach to Well actually the one thing you can say about it is, it is a good grounding for what you now go on and do Mm. because erm wherever you go now for refresher lessons, they will use the modern method. Yeah. And that's, that will build on that foundation. Yes. You'll be astonished how quickly it'll come back. Mm mm. You really will. Hopefully. Mm. Yes all we had when I was at school were l l yards of verbs and yards of nouns, we never knew how to put the two lots together. No. That's true. Yeah. Mm. The people who had the imagination or ability to do it where the ones that could speak the languages, the ones that didn't Yes it was made no connection at all. Mm. Because I knew a lot of nouns and a lot of verbs, I could get by when I went to Algeria in Mm. nineteen forty but it was I envied those who could really speak. Yeah. Mm. But erm if you see some officer floundering for the word for a cabbage or something of that sort I could provide the word and he provided the conversation. Yes. Mm. Yes. Well actually you're going to a centre aren't you er in where there will be evening classes and that sort of opportunity? Yes. I think probably It's, it's it's well erm served for for Mm I would imagine it's quite well led. Mm. Ya. And you'll have no problem, yes. Mm. Aha. I'll have to give up my art classes then which is Art? haven't been doing them recently but when I've been able to get a, er an evening away that's what I Mm mm. spend my time doing over the past few years. Yes but will it rule it out altogether do you think if you've got to do the French? Well A Alison goes out for one evening so that means I have to get back early for that evening Mm. and then if I, I go out for another one, that means two evening evenings back Yes. leaving the office at five thirty on the dot and of course Yes. I, I can't do that more than twice a week. No. No I see. Your work itself is going to take more time than that. Well yes. Is that just at first or is it regularly? No I mean it's, it's always been the case. Mm. Mm. Ya. Mm. It's tough really. It is tough. It's very erratic the work as well, it's it's Yes, is it? very, you know, stop start Yes. Is it still advertising? Yes. Yes. Yeah. You must be pretty good at that by now. Well I've got quite a lot of experience I mean I've Yes you have. I've done it since I was, well it's getting on for fifteen years now. It isn't? Yeah, thirteen years in, in Mm. the same area Mm. I've not really moved around a lot No. No. in the actual function. No. Just sort of progressed up the ladder I suppose Yes. Mhm. so, yes Yes. Oh well, you can only make the best of the thing you've got and that's the best thing to do rather than Mm. unless you're forced to switch er horses, you know in, in mid stream. Yeah. Well i i I always say that er it always comes a surprise that I was good at anything. And I always think back to the er the time I think Edmund and I were sitting in the back garden here and deciding that we'd go off and join the paratroopers Really? because we weren't going to get any O levels. Oh! And that was about all we were good for . I'm sorry. How funny. But in fact you did get your O levels didn't you? So I remember well I got a handful Yes I remember Mm. And Edmund got a B A. Yeah. Ah but wait a minute, not until after that was it? yes. He got his O levels but that was it. Yes. Decided he'd had enough and I suppose you had too. Mm well Did you stay on for As? Yes I did. Mm. But again I you know I always had the ability to er to know, to scrape by Yes. or knowing what the minimum required was and er pitching myself at just over that point I think. Yes. Which I suppose is some sort of ability Well it's a it's a, in a way that's quite true. Mm. Yes it saves the er er the use of excess energy when you don't need to doesn't it? Yes. That's right. Ah. Edmund was lucky because he got this chance to do a university you see in Mm. in er New Hampshire wasn't it? Yes. Erm Well that's when er Ben and I saw him, when he was doing it That's right, you did. doing that, yes. You did. Yeah. But I'd love to see him again. Oh yes. I'd love to get a trip out there. It would be wonderful wouldn't it? Yes. He'd so love to see people and of course at the moment Mm. he daren't make trips, or at least it wouldn't be wise to make trips yet I know, yes I know because he's waiting for his Yes, naturalization. Shame really. Yes. That's right. Can I pour you another cup of tea Ian? I'm fine actually, thank you. We've got photographs, recent ones, to show you anyway. Oh good. And we saw him in September October didn't we? Yes yes End of September beginning of October Good. and stayed they had a barn just a little way from the house, you could see it but it Right. wasn't very striking It was No it was, it was just grey and, and, and Yes. quite unobtrusive. Well they've had a marvellous sort of conversion of that done Mm. for guests and erm Because they had a beautiful house anyway didn't they? Oh a beautiful house Mm. yes and they're still in the same house. They they're Yes. very fond of it. And erm so now when we go they're awfully sweet and they bring Edmund at the same time Oh right. and we all three, Noel and Edmund and I, live in this barn. Oh that's lovely. ideal. Which is marvellous. for breakfast. George did that, really, so that when his grandchildren came he hadn't got them under his feet. No, it's a good idea. And he, well he's, he was wealthy enough to do exactly as he wanted. Yes. Yeah. It sounds ideal. It's lovely. Yeah. It's very lovely. They're such nice people. Yeah. And of course they I didn't meet him. Oh didn't you? No I only met erm Ellie Ellie. very briefly as well. Well it was summer, wasn't it? Yes er no it was April. Oh. April and the son And had they gone away then? the son was there. Dan. Dan was around and the other, the, the younger one. Oh John. I c I don't remember his name. Er John was the youngest. Yes I think it was him. Mike wouldn't be, I think he was w er getting on a bit, oh I don't know Dan lived in town Mike was at university. Yes er and the, the son, I think he was at college himself That's right. and he was sort of back and forwards but he was based That's right. in the house. Yes. That was John. yes. Mike was down at er Providence. He was in university. They're all married, those boys now. Are they? Yes. Dan is Good. married. Without any children I remember Dan but I oh yes Dan's a dear boy. Yes. And er we're very fond of them all. Mm. And erm of course er it's just like second home to Edmund. They are so good to him. Yes. I must say it's, it must be good to have somebody like that er Absolutely. o over there cos it, it must be must have felt quite isolated Yes. Oh he would if he hadn't got them Yes. certainly. Yes. I mean it's lovely because he er he adores to get into does Edmund and that means that he and George go about this lovely big er grounds that they've Yes. got and Edmund does lots of grass cutting and er tree cutting and all manner of things with Mm. George. They've got a great com a great relationship going. Good. Good. And of course he spends Christmas. let me see, Dan is the same age as John isn't he? As Ben, no Edmund isn't he? Erm I think he's a bit older. he's older. Oh. Yes He's younger than John cos Edmund and I are the same age Oh. Are you thirty f Thirty four. four now? Yes. That's right. Well I should think Dan might be Couple of years older? Not as much as that. oh. Well before they were married. Really? Yes. Gosh. Yes Dan must be I would have thought it's only months probably, but it might be quite a few months. Mm. Mm I don't think it's more because we soon had, started having our children didn't we? Mm. Erm ooh wait a minute we're saying, we're saying than Edmund aren't we? Yes mm. Of course, I'm stupid. He was the eldest of their children. Dan was? Dan was. Yes. Oh right. Yes. Ya. So I'm v I'm a bit vague about it, you may well be right and it's two years Mm. because of course we've got older children than Edmund. That would line him up with Edmund though wouldn't it? No Yes No no no, a couple of years you're quite right. Mm? Couple of years older I should think. Yeah. That's it. But erm oh they're a great family they really are but I think George and J Joy's having Edmund because although Dan lives in the town er what's it called, New Haven? Yes. Erm obviously he's got his own business, he's got a shop now, an outfitter's shop. Yes Did he have it that time? He had something like that. He was so vague though. I mean I know he was delightfully vague Oh he's an absolutely but I was never really sure what he was doing . No Er yes I I thought he had a shop, maybe yes That's er he worked in a shop probably at that time. Yes I think so yes. That's it, he worked in that er fancy goods shop That's right. nine years ago Visitors shop. that we went. Sorry? I think it was nine years ago. Was it? Yes. Yes. It doesn't seem possible really does it? The year before I married. Eighty five. Good heavens. Was it really? Is that no, no eighty five that no eighty three, that's right, yes, nine years. Was it? Mm. Yes. Oh well that was a great thing for you really wasn't it? You must have enjoyed it. Oh it was a marvellous trip. Splendid. Was it? Absolutely yeah. Mm. Really very good. Mm. I enjoyed travelling with Ben a lot. Yes. He's a very good er companion. Yes he was a good travelling companion I should Yes. imagine. Yes. Yes. He of course is Ben's been all over the world since then Well yes. I know. I'm most envious of him I am. And do you sometimes get any word from him? Very rarely. Mm well so do we. Rarely. Yes. I must write to him myself actually. Have you got his latest address? I haven't, no. I'd better give it to you because he has Right. changed it. I did bring my address book with me. I'll go and I'll go and get it for you and do make yourself another tea Oh righto I'll just, excuse me a minute I'm Yes of course You sit down, that's alright. Right. Oh yes. Oh I see. the day before he left. Mm. Is this on the sort of or something? Ah it's pretty, yes it's that sort of place Have you been to Hong Kong ? I haven't been to Hong Kong to see Ben Mhm. because, but I did go to Hong Kong when I went to China. Oh you went to China, that's right, yeah. That's right for three weeks and erm then I wasn't impressed by it, I was much more interested in China. Yes. But I would, in a way, love to go whilst he's there but he er he really feels that it wouldn't be a place that would suit pa and me on holiday. Mm. So I've heard that before. What love? Other people it's a noisy place. It isn't it isn't nice but for the young Well Enid's been there I haven't. Mm. It's nice for the young I think. As far as I've been is the airport. Mm. Now can you see Edmund's cos he changed You see it's a terrible erm Well I'll go and get it, I've got it written down there in my place. Well it's here darling but it's just a question of finding it, it's right. Just go through, you'll find it certainly. Is it that's it, is it ? That's it. Oh That's it, that's it. Well that's lovely. I'm going to get one of those articles that Ben wr Edmund wrote. Oh yes, yes he'll enjoy that. I've got no excuse now. No. Who's going to sit down? That's right sit there. I expect si , don't know how Len's gotta sit down or whether he's gotta stand. I'm gonna stand. Are you happier standing? Yes it's his That's alright . his back. Belinda if we can start with you more or less erm I heard the other day that you're half thinking that you might like to be a nurse? Yeah, that's it. That's right. Mhm. Can you speak up a bit. Speak up a bit Belinda! What erm what sort of nurse are you thinking about? Nursery nurse, looking after young children in nurseries and stuff like that. Mhm. I can imagine you doing that. Can you? Aha. Mhm. I can. Yes. I'm going, for work experience I'm going to Saxted Ministry up there hopefully to see what it's like looking after children you know, like a nursery and everything. So hopefully I can get the job there from that two weeks, and then That would be wonderful! what it's like. Yeah. I didn't Yes. know there was one at Saxted Yeah, it's called Rainbow. I think, isn't it? Yeah. Oh that's right, yes. And is that for children who are living there or just go in for the day? Just go in for the day till their parents go to work I think. Mhm, Oh Good! I think it's something like that, yeah. Aha. And what qualifications mus must you have for that? Erm, I don't really know at the moment, I gotta look up and see what it needs, like and things to do and study, things like that. Mhm. Mm. Mhm. Good! So probably GCSE Right. Mhm. It's all to do with GCSE coursework and see how we're getting on during the two weeks and we get experience for us when we leave school and go to work. That's a good idea! Yeah. You get a feeling for it then. Yeah. I think it's one of the best jobs for a girl that there are don't you? Well I think so, I think erm as long as they can go and work with children and then they've got the time when they can leave off and come, but it's having the whole time, well then they've children all their life haven't they? Yes. This is the only thing if you go sort of privately you know? Yes. You can fe start of with children and you are finishing up with children! Well that well tha wo would tha would you not think that's a good thing? Erm I mean, for instance, if you do the the very high grade Norlands nanny training they go on till they're grey and experienced it all Like me ! haven't they? Well, you know i don't they? Well Yeah. would you feel you'd not want to do it all that time then Belinda? I don't really know actually, it's always Can't yet. the time, no. That's true. I don't know but,that far ahead, you know. Just a good experience for her for time, you know. Indeed! But I shouldn't want her do it all her life! You wouldn't? No. It's a very well paid job! Oh yes, I know! What about that, but I meant she gotta think about, she'll want children of own and then she'll have chi Yes. Aren't you? Aye Liddy? Oh yes! But then don't you think that it's a, it's a marvellous training for her? That's what I say, it's a training, nice Yes. training for them, then say after about three or four year if they wanna get married, they got children and they got some good experience. Absolutely! Mm. It's invaluable. Yes. That can't be the kind of thing you're thinking of then? What do you want, what do you have er, in mind? I'd like to go into the farmer business. Would you? Yeah, erm mixed farm with animals and sort of, cereal crops, stuff like that. Good! Well you're in the right place for that. Yeah. Would you got to an agricultural college? Yeah, I'm hoping to go Ockleigh whe why am I, get older. Sort of erm working on a farm for two days then going to the college erm that, so I do it like that. Mm. It's a good place,Ockleigh Yeah. Splendid! And then, would you like to work in this area or would you like to go elsewhere? I don't know. I hadn't really thought about it, it's erm it all depends on what farm I'm going on cos I've or erm cows an , cows and bullocks, you know. Mm. Mm. And you won't have worked on a farm at all yet, will you? No. Not yet. Though, go and sometimes and he's got bullocks so that's where I go, got it from. And Dave . Oh that's good! They got ponies haven't they Yeah and Mm mm. these two erm, sort of mucking about . You think you'd quite like to be with animals would you? Yeah. Aha. And I, I wouldn't mind doing some sort of a rou , some amount of work. Yeah, what I mean, all round agricultural work and on your ? Yeah. Is that it? Well Mm. that's great! We've been gardening this morning. I was looking at the garden as I came in, I thought I might have, even though I didn't know the number Yeah. I'd have known that was your Yeah. garden. Because of all the trimmings. Well it's not very good this year aren't they? No, they're not very good at all! Well bearing in mind In fact , we're disappointed with it cos usually we have vegetables out of our own garden all the year round but they didn't do very well this year did they? No. It's Why's that? the worst garden had for years! It's a dry summer time. Really! Last summer time, I mean Ah yes! last year I was cutting cauliflowers weighing nearly five and seven pound, but this year I shan't have one weight two pound! Is that because of the dry winter? Yeah, dry is dry autumn too, you see. Yes. Yeah. Yes. They didn't really get a hold did they? They didn't get a hold, didn't get a start. Really? Aha. See an a , I wouldn't like other people keep using the water cos they very careful on using the water Yes. but if I'd have give it, had to give them some water they'd have done much better but I, like everybody else we kept hoping it were gonna rain,but ! That's right. Yeah. And it never did at the right No. time. No. No, I see. No, I mean we have to tops this time of year, we ain't got any in this year. We ain't bothered to put them did you?

That's wonderful! Because Yeah. there's nothing like them is there? Oh there isn't, no no! Aha. Well, we'll probably pick some of the spinach today and then Yeah. he's gotta dig that up and make the garden. Yes. Do you like gardening too, Ben? Ooh he love it! Oh isn't that great!

Mightn't you? Mhm. Yeah. That will be nice! Hopefully. Whereabouts is this? My erm She when you wish when you start to speak, would you please introduce yourself, give your name and who you represent. So we can make absolutely certain on the recording. That's each time. Sorry Mr . Before we start chairman, I wonder whether we can make sure that Peter , North Yorkshire County Council, that all round the table have got the relevant North Yorkshire paperwork. And I think the documents that we have put in are N Y one,posi various positions er statements, Paper N Y two, described as population household economic activity rate projections, assumptions and methodology. N Y three is a county council commentary on the regional census study, funded by the local authorities and the D O E. N Y four is a paper entitled Housing Growth Provision. And then we miss a number erm er and move to N Y eleven which is a paper which we have put in which attempts to look at the differences between certainly between the N Y C C projections and the H B F projections. And that in fact is headed by erm a summary table erm which attempts to set down on p one piece of paper, where the differences erm erm lie. And I wonder erm we specifically er identified erm the wish to to to address that particular issue. Erm and what I would like to do, that paper was written by Mr , erm our research officer and perhaps after I've made one or two general remarks, he could give you the flavour erm of of of the difference as we as we see, if that would be acceptable to you? That that that's quite acceptable. So first So if I Peter , North Yorkshire. If I continue then with some introductory remarks erm on policy H one a and one A, perhaps that would set the scene er for the discussion, then Mr will very briefly erm look at the differences as he sees them between the two sets erm of projections. Well policy H one addresses the number of dwellings to be provided in the county and the districts and and in in Greater York. And quite clearly there's a disagreement on the number of dwellings that the county council proposes. The this happened before, it happened in nineteen eighty seven erm on the first alteration when review er when they were a w wide range er of suggestions er made as to the appropriate level of provision. And to an extent, we ran through this same debate erm at the greenbelt local plan enquiry for two days during September er nineteen ninety two. It seems to be a relatively simple debate, there is either too much development in the views of some participants, erm or there is er too little. Others suggest that the county council er is about right. The county council would appear to be somewhere in the middle, based on the range of views that have been submitted to this E I P. At the top of the range we have the House Builders Federation with and excess of fif fifty thousand dwellings. At the bottom, we have J C with a figure in excess of thirty one thousand dwellings. The county council appear to be somewhere in the middle, er at around forty one thousand er two hundred dwellings. I think I need to say on that, that that should not be taken as the county council sitting on the fence between two opposing er extremes. The county council thinks that its proposed provision is the right approach and it's a balanced approach in line erm with Secretary of State's previously e stated wishes. The approach of the county council is based on certain principles, first of all it reflects the decision of the Secretary of State on the originally approved structure plan and particularly on the first alteration to the structure plans er in nineteen er eighty seven. And we've summarized in N Y four, paragraph twenty one to twenty seven, the main issues erm as we see them er there. And the conclusions appear to be that migration into the county needs to be modified, and secondly, that government policy was then and still is to pursue policies leading to the regeneration of urban areas e around North Yorkshire particularly West Yorkshire er and Cleveland. In Cleveland to the North, we have a deprived area er by any standard which is making valiant efforts to make provisions to retain er its own population as part of regenerating county Cleveland. In West Yorkshire to the South we have similar problems of inner city decline and there as we understand it the authorities wish to cater for their housing needs. The county council accepts the problems and is keen to do all it can to support those authorities er to North and South. But the county council does accept that trends for migration into the county are there and the county council cannot turn off the top to turn off the tap to reclu to preclude any further migration into the county. As a result, the county council accepts the need for a substantial element of development, which is the response to inward migration in the county. And around about sixty percent of the overall provision as we calculate it is to accommodate migration led development in North Yorkshire. As far as the debate with Leeds and Bradford is concerned, there are three districts adjacent to West Yorkshire, Selby, Harrogate and Craven. And the difference between us and the West Yorkshire authorities, appears to be eighteen hundred dwellings. That doesn't appear to be much erm in terms of quantity in our estimation in terms of the level of provision that Leeds and Bradford er are providing, but it would create a major problem er in North Yorkshire. At the other extreme, there are arguments for reduction in the at the other end of the spectrum there are arguments for reduction in the level er of housing provision proposed er in North Yorkshire. The county council does not accept that there should be any further reduction in the amount of housing that is proposed to be =commodat accommodated in the county. The county council quite clearly accepts its regional responsibilities to accommodate a significant degree er of migration led er development. We believe to further reduce erm erm the level of migration led development in North Yorkshire er would not be in the best interest of the region as a whole and more importantly, would not be in accord with the general provisions o of the structure plan to accommodate a a significant level er of development. As we see it therefore, the county council is not turning the tap off in respect of migration led development, and it is not being e too generous. We believe that the balanced approach e of the county council e is right, it reflects the views of the Secretary of State er in nineteen eighty seven, and we think it's the appropriate way for North Yorkshire to develop, bearing in mind the clear environmental constraints er within North Yorkshire. Well chairman that gives a flavour of the documentation the various documentation that we put in. You did ask erm for us to try and help this examination by giving some indication of the differences between shall we say, the two sides of the debate. Er we put in N Y eleven which is our attempt er to identify first in a summary page, er and then in a more voluminous paper, with appendices, where the differences lie and the reasons that er that we pursue one course as opposed to another. Erm this has been prepared by Mr erm and perhaps it would be helpful if he gave you the flavour of it. Stuart , North Yorkshire. Well sir er we have as Mr has said, in N Y eleven, the commentary er of our o opinions on the situation put forward by the House Builders Federation. Whereas our own er reasoned commentary is in N Y two. Er N Y two paragraph nine er gives us the background to our approach in population projections. We have er framed them to take account of the most recent information available, subject to limitations that staff time limits causes. We have sir Excuse me Mr . Can you all hear? It it shouldn't be necessary either to adjust the microphones, to switch them on or to move them actually. Alright carry on. Wherever possible sir, we have tested the validity of the individual assumptions against alternative sources of data. Er we have looked to supplement national e information by our local knowledge specifically I might instance one er where we have made a survey of the institutions which is one source of er possible difference between er people looking at the situation locally and those from further afield. We have erred I think in several instances to try and give a margin of flexibility er I think if we'd really tried hard to follow a policy of restraint within the assumptions of this model, we could have produced even lower figures than we have. I think we've tried to err being being reasonable. So that was the general approach. Er the particular methodology we've used is a population projection model, produced by the Institute. The Housing and Population model. Er this is quite commonly accepted as er in use in many places and I think my our colleagues on the other side of the table have been using the same basic modelling methodology. It starts by taking the present population a as the population of the base year, and proceeds to age the population, er adding births and subtracting deaths to get a population in the projection years. Er it begins by subtracting the institutional population from the total population in order to get the private household population. Once the population levels are calculated in the model, the population is converted in to households using marital status and rates. And once the households are calculated, the final process is to convert the households into dwellings. And to summarize the methodology that we've used, we've set out our in the single sheet in the front of N Y eleven, various assumption areas that constitute the use of the model and our choice of the appropriate assumption for each of these areas. So that for instance, er starting with a base population, we've used the Registrar General's nineteen ninety one provisional estimates. Er this was because er at the time the est that the calculations were made and reported to the committee, these were the most recently available. Er other have been able to use more recently er released information,n er namely the Registrar General's nineteen ninety one final revised estimates. As you will see from the sheet,small difference in the total population. Had the county council been able to use the final figures, the dwelling requirements at the end of the projection period would have been somewhat lower than the figure that we have produced. The conversion of the rate of population to private household population has been accepted that er we use as everybody has used, the county council's estimate of the institutional population. So this does not appear as a technical difference. Sorry would you re would you repeat that. You say there is no difference of opinion on that one now. On on the level of the institutional Yeah. population. There is a difference of opinion in the effect on the number of households produced by the way that the military Yeah. population in married quarters is treated. Yes I appreciate that. Yes. But you haven't highlighted that I haven't highlighted that as an area of difference . N n no no. Cou co could I ask you and try to short circuit actually the presentation if you if you if you don't mind, to actually concentrate on those issue items where there are these significant differences which which you which you mentioned. Well the largest difference er from the sheet is in the death statistics. And er we will maintain that we've used the appropriate statistics from the office of population censuses and surveys and the Registrar General's er and erm our colleagues have made an error is our opinion on er the er death statistics that they've used in their calculations of the model in our opinion. In that they have not taken the correct figures. I can't explain the reasons why . Our our figures we maintain are the correct ones. Yeah I mean I I would assume that there must be agreed death rates which everybody would accept as as as being applicable in projecting population . We would have said we would have thought that too sir but er it appears that er Well I I think I'll wait for H B F to come back on that one. But yo the figure the the figure which you mentioned Yeah . Can can I just add sir o one point I I in my in my preamble I said that we were sometimes able from a local point of view to take into account information locally that perhaps you wouldn't have got from further afield. Er within the model, there is the provision to er not take the date which is issued with the model, but to allow for local correction factors and it er maybe that we've got the locally correct death statistics in and our colleagues haven't got the local corrections. Well we'll we'll we'll come back to that one later one but if you just carry on talking through the various er items where there is these there are these significant differences. Well that is the er most significant difference sir. Er a difference has er appeared in concealed households, at three thousand . The county council maintains that er the project methodology takes account of all classes of households er within the methodology itself. And so there does not need to be a separate provision made for numbers of concealed households. Er our understanding is that er our colleagues the other side of the table wish to reduce the number of consumer households from the level it was at the nineteen ninety one census, which is the figure here, three one seven to zero. Eliminating the numbers of concealed households, and therefore the number of dwellings to be provided to cater for that. Er and we feel that that would be er unrealistic but within the modelling context, we don't think that it needs to be separately taken into account. There are households concealed households at the beginning of the period in our projections, there are households at the end of the period which are also concealed. This we feel matches the real world situation, where er the poor being always with us, there will always be people who while wishing to have accommodation . So that is an area of er significant difference. The next er most important er in terms of of erm numbers is er migration levels. H here we we have two categories of of areas of difference. There is the technical basis on the one hand, and there is a policy er er area. I think then there's a catchphrase, environmental discounts. And I think these phrases appear in the text. As far as the technical points are concerned er there is the question, which source of data should be used to quantify migration. And over how long a period should the migration be taken. The county council has used the National Health Service's central record of patient re-registrations as its principle source of for migration data and has chosen an eight year period to measure the trend. Er our colleagues I think have chosen a different period trend. I think it's a ten year period they've taken and th the er source is as much the a sort of a residual figure that comes from the Registrar General's mid year estimates,nineteen ninety one. As against the nineteen eighty one estimates. Deducting actual change and ending up with . We maintain that this balance not only includes migration but includes other adjustments. So the figures for migration are not necessarily purely migration figures and we are er we don't dispute the length of the trend to take the ten years. Ten years as it happens is not a lot different to eight years. The choice of the time period for migration is very important. if we had taken the most recent trend, it would have been over the last three years. This is shown er in the appendix to N Y two. Appendix five. Which is a table showing annual average migration figures for the years nineteen eighty five to nineteen ninety two. Appendix five of N Y two. There you'll see there is an eight year trend, the mean of which is just under five thousand. From which we make a deduction and I'll come back to that deduction in a moment if I may sir. If one took just the last three years, the annual average migration figure would be a little under three thousand three hundred. Had we used this three thousand three hundred figure as the annual migration, then the housing requirement figures come out of the projection rather then two thousand and six, would have been some ten thousand fewer. So the choice of the length of the trend is er very important. The source is important and er how you deal with the source. Er I mentioned that we have made an allowance for students in this migration. Er this is not to say, I must emphasize that we have discounted students in this migration assessment. What we have done is to discount excess students. Er there is a technical report that has examined this sort of information erm for the year nineteen eighty one nineteen eighty eighty one, specifically for this county. Er the research found that there were three hundred or so students who registered with the health service but didn't re-register or didn't leave. So that that was a a a fact that er Yeah. Does this make a significant difference to the the hous household requirement ? Yes One o one of the elements that goes towards the four thousand four hundred Yeah. difference in migration. Er I don't think I couldn't at this moment in time, give you the components No. of of which of these four thousand four hundred is d due to the time period which is due to the source which is due to the er student er excess student discount. So that is a significant er difference sir between e our calibrations of the model and others. Yeah. other differences are smaller in scale as you will see, there is a difference in er vacant dwellings,the county council er takes the view that er Yes I I I Yeah sorry to interrupt, I mean I follow the arguments you've used within the document but I the figure which the H H B F have attributed to vacant dwellings for example is just under two thousand five hundred. Or is this th is this an adjusted figure now? Having had the discussion between the two parties. Is it six hundred ? Er we have had er recent correspondence with the H B F and er my e colleague Mrs Long can give you the the detail of that. We would we would er revise the difference figure on the basis of that conversation. So d d d the the six thousand the six hundred does not really apply any more . Well No well I I'll I'll come back to that issue with with H B F but Er but but it it is not simple as in any of these matters er in that the change in the vacant dwellings difference here also has a consequential figure for dwellings different at the end. Because of what the er effect is in the calculations and again we we could go into that in some detail if wanted to. No I'm I'm trying to avoid too much detail if I can. What I'm trying to to establish in in a fairly simplified form actually, are the areas of difference and whether some of those are still capable of being reconciled, because of the way in which you a you know the the the different parties may have made different approaches but in fact you might come to an agreement about that. But there are other ar areas where in fact you may simply agree to disagree. For various reasons. Mm. Well I think having had a meeting with the er house builders er representatives earlier on, this table of differences now represents the differences that there are still remaining. Yeah right. Before the H B F respond and I appreciate they want to respond to what Mr said. Can I say in relation to what Mr has said Mr . . Sorry I'm er Mr has er Our aim must be to identify what really matters. Technical experts will always disagree, erm there was a time when I too would claim to be one of them. But I'm not here to play that role. We must please be clear about those factors which actually matter, always bearing in mind that it is for the county council in the first instance and perhaps for the panel in the second instance, to take a decision about the suppression of past migration trends. In other words not to provide for a continuing level of migration as it has been in the past. In that context, it seems to me that some of the differences between the technical experts pale into insignificance and therefore do net deserve our spending any great time upon them. There are other matters however, which seem to me to be much more significant in statistical terms and in relation to the total level of provision Mm. which the county propose. Can we please concentrate on those that are truly significant? Mr I hope that hasn't cleared anything of what you wanted to say. Thank you. Right, thank you very much. Er Roy , House Builders Federation. I'll try my best to to respond to most of what we've already heard this morning. Erm, the basic stance of the er er of the federation is that we erm make use of the latest information. We regard that as being consistent with government policy, as set out in P P G twelve. But it is in our view, government policy to provide for development needs. Consistent within a framework of regional guidance. We have as Mr said already this morning, we have no regional guidance. Erm and his claim that in fact the regional draft regional guidance er that has emerged is consistent with this alteration, is not really surprising since the same parties drew up the same document. . So our purpose here and I would echo er what Miss has just said, is essentially to take a view about migration. That is the essential component erm which er will determine e effectively the strategic policy which will apply to this county. It's interesting that despite all that's been said about migration and I'll come back to it, but we actually start, the county and ourselves, from the same point, more or less, within about four four dwelling I think. Erm and but it's after that that we we we differ a bit. However as far as the basic strategy is concerned of this particular alteration, it includes for the first time, conversions. And that is a fundamental change to the previous strategy. And it amounts to, in effect a twelve point five percent decrease in housing provision. At a time when household formation rates suggest we should be going in the opposite direction, simply to stand still. This is a fundamental change of strategy without doubt. I don't want to hold up this alteration, and I, like Mr , don't want to wait three years for a decision. But I would say to you that such a fundamental change of strategy, would normally have its proper place in a replacement plan, rather than an alteration. So how do some of our differences come about. We have a number of technical differences which are essentially differences about the composition of the population and its natural change. And we would say that that difference amounts to sixteen hundred dwellings. We have a base dwelling difference, although in view of your remarks, that may well pale into insignificance. But nevertheless, it is a matter of fact that there is a difference of seven hundred and fifty dwellings, in the base dwellings that we've used. We do have a difference in vacancies. Er whereas the County Council have sought to re to er keep vacancies constant, we have said that it is reasonable to seek to plan to keep second homes etcetera as a constant number but what I would term normal vacancies, can be reasonably be expected to go up to maintain the same proportion. That does I think form a significant element because it makes a difference of nearly two and a half thousand dwellings. Perhaps I could intervene and try to establish a view on vacancies, so at least we can get one element of out Mm. of the debate out of the way. And perhaps Miss and D O E may have a view to contribute too. But if I can put my thinking erm on the floor first, it seems to me that vacant Normal vacancies as Mr has described them, are a function of people moving from one house to another. And it seems to me there is no reason to suppose that because there are more houses, the propensity to move from one house to another declines. Perhaps before gentleman of the County Council whose name I still can't see comes in, Miss may wish to say something. I think in this day and age, there is probably a greater propensity to move and consequently there may well be an increased erm amount of vacancies occurring and that was why in our statement, we actually increased the number of vacancies, but I think that is a function of the number of houses on offer at the time. Mm. H how in that context, does the County Council defend its position Mr You're not Mrs , you're Mr Thank you. Mr will Yes Malcolm , County Council. I think our concern is that the vacancy rate erm in the census indicates that some seven point one percent of the the properties in the county are vacant at er at that time. We are very concerned that in in making provision for housing through to the year two thousand and six, we should not be making provision for that level of vacancy rate, which seems to us to be artificially high when compared with the the national figures. And indeed we hear from the D O E that they have a figure in their paper of something like five and a half percent. The figure that we have come up with in fact is derived by holding constant the numbers rather than the rate of vacant dwellings through to the year two thousand and six, which implies that by the year two thousand six, we'd have would have a vacancy rate of six point two percent or or thereabouts. Which is still substantially higher than the national figure, and substantially higher than the figure being proposed by the Department of the Environment for North Yorkshire. Can you split that six point two percent between the the second homes etcetera and the normal vacancies? Erm I don't have the figures off hand but I er we could provide those figures. Because it presupposes, if one a assumes that the second homes etcetera remain constant. It presupposes a reduction in the rate of normal vacancies. I I th would prefer to look at the vacant dwellings as a single entity rather than necessarily splitting them down between the the the various types. My question still remains the same then. Does it not presuppose a reduction in the rate of all vacancies? That's right, yes, from seven point one to six point two percent over the period through to two thousand and six. If you accept that that derives from the propensity to move, is it sensible to make that assumption? But that is only one of the factors in North Yorkshire that is influencing the vacancy rate. We do have a very large proportion of holiday accommodation and second homes, which are concentrated in certain parts of the county. And we're concerned that this figure of seven point one percent, is in fact artificially inflating the housing requirement through to two thousand and six. I had hoped this would be a short point. Could I ask Mhm. Our figure discounted second homes. Our figure of the vacancy assumptions is the number of vacant dwellings. Yes your rate was something like five and a half percent if I remember rightly, yes yes. Yes. No Whereas That's right yes, but it has takes no takes no account of second homes. H B F have gone for four point four five percent. Yes. But leaving the second homes as a constant figure and separate from is that right? I can't quite see the reason for discounting second homes altogether as the D O E have done. They are a factor in the the housing market in North Yorkshire and I think that we have to take those into account when we are looking at vacancy rates through to two thousand and six. And I think the overall figure that we've had produced, which is around the six point two percent, is still a very substantial level of vacant dwellings within the county. And I'm in no doubt that that will allow for the operation of a housing market, through movements er population and so forth. What can the County Council do first of all to stop people moving house and secondly, to stop people stop d to prevent any change in the number and distribution of second homes? The County Council isn't actually trying to control who occupies houses and what purpose they occupy them. What we're concerned with is the amount of land that or the amo number of dwellings that we are providing, through the structure plan, through local plans for the future. Er we're not seeking to control individual occupancy, that is not possible through the planning system. But the implication of a declining rate of vacancies, is that something will stop people moving house. No I I'm not sure it necessarily will stop people moving house, what we're talking about is a level of provision for vacancy rates which is still well above national rates. Is that including your second homes though? That is including second homes yes . Yes. But it Mr , I'd hoped it would be a short point. Obviously we're not going to reach agreement on that , but do you want to come back on vacancies. Or or indeed does Mr want to come in on vacancies? I could. Steven from . I think inadvertently, Mr has has slightly muddied the waters, by reintroducing second homes. I think that discussion is more usefully conducted in terms of what you called normal vacancies. And this is the basis on which the D O E have put in their figure, it's the basis on which we have put in a figure for vacant dwellings, and also the H B F. And all of us as it were, set aside as a block, all the second homes as holiday homes and say, those are as it were , outside this enquiry, we'll leave them there. They don't even enter into the projections we have done at all. Because they're a constant number, it doesn't arise. I think the issue as you rightly as Miss rightly put it, is the normal vacancy rate and is there any reason to suppose as the County Council must be supposing, that this shrinks to a degree. And when I say the vacancy rate, I mean a percentage rather than a number. And I don't see any mechanism whereby that production can be engineered, or indeed any intention by the County Council to engineer such a reduction. In which case I would see that the sensible thing to do, which is what we have done, is to assume that the current vacancy rate stays the same as a percentage and that with a larger dwelling stock, results in some additional vacant dwellings. I I can't say any more than that. Erm that is exactly our point of view. Sorry can I just come back to Mr 's point, where you say, that the current rate of vacancy. Are you talking about the current rate as it prevails or we're told it prevails ion North Yorkshire, or are you looking at a figure which is somewhat nearer the national average or the figure which Mr 's organization have chosen. Steven ,. We have sought to use the rate for the percentage for North Yorkshire, as at the nineteen ninety one census. I interrupted Mr . Right, er thank you very much. Roy , House Builders Federation. Erm so moving on, apart from the difference in in in vacancies, we then have erm a difference related to concealed households. Erm Mr has explained the view which is taken been taken by by North Yorkshire. Our view is that we should seek to accommodate concealed households. Concealed households are people who exist currently within the county. Whether or not further concealed households are formed over the next fifteen years, seems to me to be an irrelevance. It it should be the purpose of the planning authorities to seek to house its people. By ignoring concealed households, it is in fact not seeking to house its people, and is in fact not doing what in fact it says it should be doing within the explanatory memorandum. I suspect after the Prime Minister's speech last night, it's no longer political correct to talk about single parents. If he's back to basics, but is it realistic to suggest that there will that all concealed households will disappear? I am er it it may or may not be realistic to suggest that all concealed households will disappear. I did say that it's probable that concealed households will be formed over the fifteen year period. So they will continue to arise, but I think that it is right to plan to accommodate the ones that you know about. And the ones that we know about at the moment are the ones revealed from the census. The information from the Department of the Environment's nineteen eight nine based household projections, suggests that in fact there is a slightly larger number possibly erm in in in the round and that is five thousand dwellings as opposed to the three thousand one hundred and seventy we're seeking to include. And so to take what we would describe as a reasonable view on this, we say that if you know from evidence there are a number of concealed households, you should seek to accommodate them. And it is that is essentially the bottom line. Erm one could plan to accommodate more on the chance that they will arise, but we're not putting that forward. Erm the then the seems to us the final er difference between ourselves and the er county council, is the issue of migration and what's already been referred to as environmental discounts. I'm sure we'll come on to discuss the nature and extent of those environmental discounts later. Erm but what we would say at this stage, is that there doesn't seem any rationale behind the discounts that have been applied by by the County Council, indeed we have a situation in Hambleton district, where there is a seventy percent discount, erm which doesn't seem to us to have been explained or justified. Erm we have put forward an alternative er mechanism for environmental discounts and er I can say by at this stage, by reference to the erm critique that has taken place of that of those environmental discounts in N Y eleven, that erm, while we wouldn't go along with making anywhere near the the additions that are suggested there, erm it may be that it would be sensible to make a further discount in respect of the heritage coast. So long as that does not include Whitby and Scarborough and er any settlements to the West of the what is essentially the coast road. Erm it may be that it it is sensible to make that discount and would only ap apply to Scarborough dis district, but as for the rest of the additional elements of er environmental discount that should be applied, I can't see why you should apply a discount in relation to agricultural land. I'm not aware we've got people living physically on agricultural land at the moment, they are fields as far as I know. Er and it would be just as sensible to make a discount for industrial land on that basis. I don't see why you should make a discount in respect of greenbelts. It is a matter of fact that greenbelts simply displace people around. Indeed the York greenbelt is entirely designed to do that. Displace people from York to er according to this structure plan alteration, partly to a new settlement on the outside of the greenbelt. And indeed within the greenbelt there are a number of settlements which we are sitting in one at the moment. Er which er have housing proposals within them and er to just make an average for the discount for the whole of the relevant parish, would be to overstate that particular case. Erm so we have we have er a a a a major difference there. Erm but our summary really would be that if one followed the County Councils proposals, this county would end up with a severe housing shortage. And that will actually drive people away from North Yorkshire. It won't actually stop people coming in to North Yorkshire. We don't have passports in this country, although as a long-standing Yorkshireman, I've always thought we should have them with Lancashire, but that's another issue. Erm but we don't and in fact what will happen in a housing shortage is that in migrants will be able to buy their way in. To some extent, the government's policy of affordable housing will enable an element of affordable housing to be provided, but it won't satisfy the needs of either people who are currently on the bottom of the housing rung and seeking to move up, nor will h help people who might be seeking to afford to c to come in as first time buyers as opposed to people who are otherwise er some other arrangement through an affordable housing provider. I have circulated round this morning, three er sheets which which help demonstrate that particular point. The second sheet which is headed commitments, is a list which is derived from er the statements made by the different authorities, er about the number of dwellings which are already permitted in one form or another. Er within their area. And we can see there that there are some nearly thirty three and a half thousand dwellings already committed. And having looked at identified needs for affordable housing, within again various statements made by the local authorities and compared those with the commitments that are left, in other words the places where they they could reasonably be found, we get some fairly large percentages of affordable housing requirement le on on on the remaining land. And on the front sheet o entitled affordable housing, we see there that in the case of Hambleton we'd be looking at forty one percent, of the remaining dwellings being unaffordable being affordable houses, down to York where it goes up to ninety percent. That is on the basis of the proposals put forward by the County Council. On the other hand, if the panel were to accept the figures which we are putting forward, you can see from the s the t table at the bottom of the page, those proportions come back to down to much more reasonable amounts. And we would say that that is much more likely to be achieved. In short, we are the people who are looking after the interests of the North Yorkshire people. And providing for their needs. Similarly,I have also circulated a table entitled environmental capacity, where I have looked at what is the difference in percentage land-take terms, between the proposals of the county council and the proposals of the federation. We can see from that table that even on unconstrained land, we are talking about a difference of point one nine percent of land take. I would suggest to you that this must be an extraordinarily sens environmentally sensitive county if it cannot afford over fifteen years, to take an extra point one nine percent of its unconstrained land into development. And if by doing so it was to ensure that people who are already resident in this area are driven, this would be a totally inadequate response to the needs of the people of North Yorkshire. If we convert your nought point one nine percent into hectares we're talking about roughly five hundred, is that right? Erm If I if I take Yes yes Yes two one four O from Yes. one six four eight. Yes. That Erm Sorry. Just one final point if I may about er er about about migration. Which I'll just pick up on as a as as a final point. Erm Mr introduced the the the the the prospect that erm if they'd have taken migration over the last three years, it would have been a much reduced figure. Oh yes, of course it was, the last three years have been a recession, what else would you expect. We don't think it is sensible to plan for a recession. And indeed, given the number of dwellings that are proposed by the County Council, we see from completion rates that in fact those figures, broadly compare to the sort of completion rates we've had through the recession. This then is essentially as we see it, a plan for the recession. It is not a plan for the needs of the people of North Yorkshire. And indeed, in efforts to des to also confirm our reasonableness in the figure that we've put forward, despite the fact that it's much higher than the counties, I have included in my submission, paragraph thirty nine, that there are a number of factors we could have taken into account, but haven't have chosen not to do so, er which would have in fact upped the dwelling requirement. And one of them to some extent has has has already been discussed. Which was which was that we didn't take the whole of the vacant dwellings, we only took a part, even though we are not aware of any planning policy that will restrict occupation of dwellings as second homes. Thank you. Mr Mr , Thank you for that, er er so we're we're still talking in terms of a difference of just over twelve thousand dwellings between yourselves and the county. Indeed. Er at the risk of upsetting everybody again, can I go back to the point which has been made by North Yorkshire on this summary sheet here. To the apparent difference between yourselves and them on the death statistics. Yeah. I mean is this real or is it a red herring, which? Well I think it's only part of the picture, that is one element of er the whole make up of er of the population structure. And therefore, it takes one element and er it it erm it it seeks to highlight that particular element. I would also say that in fact er in in the paper that the number of deaths is converted into houses by app application of a factor of one point seven. Which I understand is the pensioner h er occupancy rate. I I In other words, all the extra deaths are going to occur only in pensioners? That may be very good news for the people of South Yorkshire who are below the age of sixty five, but I don't think it's realistic. Erm and so er I think that that is a slightly over-exaggerated figure anyway, and should be more like four thousand one hundred dwellings, even on this basis. But that said, erm what what it what the position is, er i is that we have put into the model Well we haven't put it into the model because it was given to us a part of the model and possibly by now North Yorkshire may have the revised model, No they haven't yet. But erm and essentially, the difference is this, if I can illustrate it by means of reference to appendix four in er N Y two of o o of North Yorkshire. It seems to me from looking at the figures within the projections that what North Yorkshire are are planning is that we'll have a return to that widening black area that's part of that particular diagram. What we are saying, and this is as a result of figures which are supplied by O P C S is that we are broadly saying that we will remain in this narrow band towards the end. Mm. And that essentially is the difference. And erm since we're both to some extent, crystal ball gazing, I suggest it's a matter of choice which to believe is most likely. Thank you. Mr . Steven ,. I think I can help you on the particular limited point of deaths and their effect. Erm You asked some while ago whether it shouldn't be possible at least to have a an agreed view on how many people are dying as it were. But what is more difficult is to have an agreed view on how many people will die and at what rate, in the year two thousand and one and beyond. Erm I have laid round the table this morning, and I hope you have it, a single sheet of paper which sets out the component differences between the projections and the County Council. I only want to speak at this juncture on the element of that which is due to lower mortality as I call it, I E deaths and this is addressed in paragraph five and in the table at the bottom which shows an effect of about two thousand er extra households, due to lower mortality rate assumptions in our projections. Lower that is than the County Council. The difference arises essentially from an improvement which is now evident in the latest national projections. And those date from a nineteen ninety one base, as compared to what was being forecast from the nineteen eighty nine. Thank you. Any view from the county on that point? Mrs . Mrs , North Yorkshire County Council. I think one point that seems to have bis been missed by the H B F or is the fact that the population is growing. I too do have increased erm life expectancy for the very elderly, in our figures, the number of eighty five increased by sixty percent. We are not trying to say that the number of deaths are going to increases substantially so that the population is not growing. Within the sorry within the H B F projections, the populations grows by seventy thousand persons, so even though we have increased death statistics, mortality statistics where life expectancy is going to increase, by applying those onto a higher population you're naturally going to have more deaths. I don't see how that you can possible reduce the number of deaths within the county, or even maintain it at the same level. With this sort of growth. And migration is restricted to the very young, we do have high levels of migration by those in retirement age groups. Can I add a supplementary er c coming back er. I think it's very instructive that er H B F didn't deny that they'd made a mistake on this number and just talking about old people, er the fact is that eighty five percent of deaths in the county occur to people aged over sixty five. And so er there is a very strong correlation between er age and death unfortunately. And we're not trying to er be er unduly morbid about this, but recognize the facts of life. Er the er narrow band that is referred to in eighty nine, nineteen ninety one between births and deaths. We would be very pleased to see it continue to narrow, indeed we we we we we wouldn't wish to to see it revert, but that again is a demographic fact. Er not because of the number of deaths is going to vary sig very significantly as Mrs said, we we are allowing it to improve over time gradually. But it's a factor because of the births is more volatile. And the numbers of births will reduce and so there will be more deaths. Er m more of a natural change. I I I Roy , House Builders Federation. I I think I must come back with the fact that I haven't denied we made made a mistake. I haven't confirmed it either. Erm the simple fact is that the factors that have gone into the model that which we have used, have been the nineteen ninety one based fertility, mortality and infant mortality rates. And have been the nineteen ninety one based,correc local correction factors. The fact that it gives a different result from the ones that North Yorkshire have used, certainly they've used the neight eight nineteen eighty nine based fertility, mortality, infant mortality rates. I'm not sure what local correction factor they've used. I thought from the discussion we had a month or so ago, that they've used the eighty three based correction factors, but it maybe something else because the description this morning was given it was some lo other local one. But nevertheless it's a different one. The fact of the matter is we've used different factors. I used ones supplied which come effec effectively from government sources. They have used some other. They are different, but they're not necessarily right or wrong. Mrs , North Yorkshire County Council. The actual local correction factors that are supplied by the Institute are calculated by themselves. They do look at the statistics the government statistics for fertility and mortality, but they have then the ability to amend, to adjust to local erm to to match up with local information. But they are supplied by the Institute and not the government. I don't want to be picky about this but but I mean they are government based. It's a comparison of of what's happening in the county in terms of registrations of births and deaths, and what's happening nationally. So of course they're based on national figures. I I have a I have a nasty suspicion that we could go on all day like this if if I allowed it to happen. Er er I d I don't think that we as a panel are necessarily going to ever and and and it may not be our role in fact to do so, to come to a judgement on it, but I would have thought as a matter of common sense, and common agreement, that there should be some er way in which the various parties would come together on the basic demographic statistics and would certainly accept that certain basic projections should be used i in looking forward. But before I move on to suggest we have a break for coffee, is there anyone else would like to pick up any points on the demographic matters that we've been discussing, leaving aside the discussions on migration. come back to that later on. Leeds, Mr from Leeds. Yes, Ed from Leeds City Council. Yes chair I I'd like to raise a question. Is it legitimate for North Yorkshire to include environmental discounts in their calculation? And I say that because as Mr touched on in his introduction, the West Yorkshire districts are set a methodology for the definition of their housing requirement, buy R P G two. Strategic guidance for West Yorkshire. Now that guidance does not entitle the West Yorkshire districts to introduce environmental constraints the calculation of their housing requirement. Necessarily therefore, if North Yorkshire proceed with environmental constraints applying in their county as a whole, the proper planning of the region is being frustrated because somebody is not being planned for. Mr . Can I just clarify er this point that the concept of environmental discounts is not one that's been pursued by the County Council, though the Secretary of State quite clearly requires local to take into account environmental consideration. Environmental discounts and our comments on those are in relation to a concept, I think introduced largely by er the House Builders Federation. And our comments are to what you should or should not include erm as an environmental discount. So it's not our concept, we're not applying environmental discounts. The County Council's position is that er it has taken on board, environmental considerations. I think if you look at the House Builder's Federation's papers, there you will see, their idea of environmental discount. I think environmental discount and environmental considerations are factors which we'll come back to in in looking at the migration rates, so you're going to have another shot at this one. Mr . Yes thank you chair. Erm it's really just coming back on the issue of concealed household earlier. Er notice from the York City Council's submission, there is a difference in opinion between ourselves and the county on the calculation of housing requirement for the City of York. That what is discussing this morning, a relatively minor difference in terms of numbers. Now it does in fact arise from this issue of concealed households. Erm I think it is one of the important that should be emphasized. I think as Mr did say, erm the issue of affordable housing is a very real one. The government guidance er in P G three makes it very clear now that it's an issue we do have to address and if we don't for land requirement. We live in urban areas as well as rural areas. Erm . And so we have considered that an additional should be made in the City of York to take account of a policy objective of reducing the level of concealed and sharing households. Thank you for that. Can I just finish this this this session with one question back to North Yorkshire because I think you said, Within your sorry within your Sorry I'll come back to you, Within your projections you actually take account of concealed households. They are identified . True or false? False. They are identified within the census. Yes. The additional dwellings are not added on to eliminate the problem. However as the actual number of dwellings increased, the proportion of those living in concealed households does actually reduce. Right okay. I understand now what you're saying. Mr . Steven ,. Two small points sir still on these technicalities of projections. And the first is to pick up on concealed households and just to add to the points that have already been made that erm neither the House Builders Federation nor ourselves are assuming that all be housed, but the projected number is five thousand whereas we're housing three thousand odd of them. But also to say that elsewhere in this region, planning is on a basis that all consumer households will be housed. West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire strategic guidance housing numbers include all concealed households. So if we are to have a consistent regional planning framework, that should be weighed in the balance as to whether they're taken into account in North Yorkshire. I also want to to actually draw your attention to one item on household rates. I hesitate to do so because that's actually a source of difference between us and the County Council. But there are parties round this table who have nostalgic hankering for a projections. And I've put around today a short paper which has a a graph attached to it which I think adds to the explanation when I draw your attention to. It's a graph of average household size in North Yorkshire, and it's to that extent it's an attempt to summarize into one figure, the headship rate effect as it affects average household size. The the falling line in er in a continuous line is . Derived either from County Council sources or actual census reports so that is as it were, fact. And when you come to the lines on the right hand side, you have two views of the future, which are labelled eighty five based and eighty nine based. And the are these are the D O E's projected household sizes from those two sets of household projections. And I think the point the graph makes very clearly is that the eighty nine based set up here at least in my view, to fit far better to what has been happening than eighty five based set. Not only had a much slower rate of fall, but are actually detached nineteen ninety one from what we know has been happening. Thank you. Thank you. Mr Mr ? Yes. Chairman representing . I'd like to ask a question please of Mr . Could he explain or clarify please what his unrestrained land, this four hundred and ninety two hectares. Is it erm the national parks and greenbelt or I'd like to understand what it means. Erm the if if if you turn to the er Selby submission on H one, you'll find a table at the back of that submission and that's where that's the that's where that the basis of that. Could could you Are you happy with that? Erm. Would you like it spelt out? I'd like to turn turn to the . Selby? Selby. Selby H one. Have a look at it while we're having Coffee Mr . Can we have a break now for fifteen minutes? Come back at quarter to twelve. are you . No that's . Yes sir the erm Mr Cowie. Mr Grigson the positive paper this morning was er one item and also the more general question of the nineteen eighty nine projections closer than the nineteen eighty five ones. Er we've used the nineteen eighty nine ones but we are reluctant to do so. We don't necessarily believe that they are all correct in what they say. Sorry the nineteen eighty nine projections for what? Headship. Erm they're obtained by looking at the results of the labour force survey which is a very small proportion of households surveyed each year. And so there must be an element of doubt over having updated from nineteen eighty one here to nineteen eighty nine. Er we are confirmed in our reservations about this by the results of the regional census study as I noted in my of animals, dogs and horses and so on, and pet shops and so on , do, does the Chief Fire Officer think in his local knowledge, that most of these have been inspected by his officers, or does he get the feeling there, that sometimes the district councils are not asking for these inspections? It varies a great deal depending on the district council. What I have to say really, is that most of those premises present very little risk at all, and, and I think that any change in the implementation of fire safety legislation should be based in prioritization. Now that's something that's difficult for us to do, because the more dangerous, the more erm, the premises should present the greatest life risk, are not necessarily the ones over which we have strict legislative control. I mean for example hospitals and nursing homes, we have a purely tenuous control over, whereas we have a very rigid control over a signal box on a railway. Now a signal box on a railway presents a fairly limited risk to life and a nursing home presents a fairly dramatic risk. Yes Jim, or Chairman, if, if someone doesn't come under the regulations and is operating a business or something of that sort,is there the facility for that body, either the management body or the business to ask voluntarily for you to inspect, with a view to issue a, er, erm, a certificate er, erm of er, safety? There's no If anybody wants a fire certificate and we had a recent case where a notable local solicitor asked us to issue a fire certificate and we refused, because his premises does not require one, or did not at that point require a fire certificate. Then he subsequently moved one person from the ground floor onto the first floor, which meant that he did require a fire certificate. But if it's not required by law, then I cannot issue, and if people ask for advice we are obliged under Fire Services, the Fire Services Act to give that advice, but what I'm really saying is that with the, the pressure of work on the Fire Safety Department, it's likely that if it's a fairly low risk to life, we'll never get round to it, and that's the honest truth. That's on your statutory requirement? Yes So what you're saying is, that if people er, if people's consciences state I ought to try and do this, but I'm not required by statute to do, the chances is that A, that you, you can't do it anyway, but B you wouldn't have the facilities to do it anyway, as well. We, we, we will normally get round to people. We do inspect . But we probably don't inspect and give advice to people who'd like us to, because they're not a priority, and we don't have the resources to do that. A lot of interesting points come out there, haven't they? Cap If, if, if I could summarize, if you could bear with me by saying that, there is no embracing legislation which covers fire safety, and there is no legislation which actually prioritizes it. What we have is picking up a ragbag of stable door legislation, that came out of other Acts, and that's why we have offices, shops and railway premises from the Oswald Acts which were neatly tucked in the back of Oswald's Act. Hotels which were in the first days of making order, and factories which came from the old Factories Act. And the cost, or the potential cost of designating particular, like hospitals and similar premises is so prohibitive that the government has chosen never to implement the designating orders for them. And I hasten to say it, governments of all persuasions assume it must be being done. Someone move the recommendation? I will Yes Five point seven, paper J, Fire and Rescue Service Training. Different board is the outcome of the P A G inspection? Yes, it seems it I don't know, Mr Chairman, I think you've always been very keen on this trend and supported it fully. And, I, I will support this number seven, seven with recommendations. Thank you there We are moving on reasonably well on this issue. Yes, well we've got to Reasonably well, yes, reasonably well Then I hesitate to say that there's probably a more complex issue now even than the Fire Station, erm,the figures which are given incidentally are the original estimate there, because that was what was available to us at the time. They have now been varied slightly but they make very little difference. A question that's already been asked of me, on appendix C, up at employee at the largest single figure there is a hundred and thirty seven thousand eight hundred. That's not a way of fudging some other cost, the retained fire fighters are recompensed when we provide training for them, because they normally have to lose work or whatever. They are very, very expensive to train because of that. We train whole-time fire fighters cheaply, but we pay the retained people compensation for loss of earnings. That figure is the majority, the majority of that figure is compensation for loss of earnings. That's the trouble, you get cheap service from retained personnel, but they're incredibly expensive to train. But absolutely essential. That's the only time you pay loss of earnings? Yes If they've taken off for a fire two days or something? They're going to get paid then. We pay them for attending fires. The only other time they're paid compensation for loss of earnings, is when they're sick as a result of an injury received on duty, you know Fire Brigade duty. Well this recommendation's been moved, seconded? Yes Five point eight, Emergency Planning Are you going to speak on it or not? The recommendation's here. Chair, here. We move There is one thing, and I think I did take it with you, erm, Mr Chairman, I'm with the erm, I've forgotten what the question on, corporational liberties, the thing that is concentrating many of our minds quite some , but the er, would, would the Chief Fire Officer like to? Yes, well he s he did take it up with me as a, er, I mean you did take it up I didn't complain, I didn't complain, I suggested it. No, but what, what I'm, what I mean, what I said such as emergency services. Now the emergency services are police, fire, and erm, and ambulance. There's a fourth one actually, but everyone knows who they are So those do cover the police. I mean, if the police and the ambulance service. Could, could that just be underlined perhaps in, by rephrasing it slightly to emphasise that, because I, I think that I think we all know what emergency services are We, we know but You don't, I see we, we do, but there's no harm, in view of our knowledge and experiences just to put that phraseology in a little bit bolder. I, I, I, I think Mr Chairman what I, I think I explained to you what my concern was, that we have cases where there's a serious road accident, and erm, and the road is stopped, we have no real authority to turn traffic or divert traffic, but the, the police are the only ones that can, and if we want to get down in, in, into an emergency very quickly. I, I mean it's only by the good will of the police that we can get down there and that,, this is, this is my concern Mr Chairman, in, in theory what I would like, if there was a serious emergency, you'd get a senior officer in here straight away, and I mean he would negate to the police, we have no authority over them, only cooperate with the police. And that's my concern. Well I, I I, I, I mean they're, you, you, I mean they're very good, but they do, er a lot are imperfect, a law unto. Oh, oh, I think all it wants is that paragraph rephrasing and with more strongly emphasis but, on the lines on with that. That's all I think Chairman, I don't suppose that er, you'll disagree with that will you? Well I, I wouldn't disagree with it, but I, but I, the description is perfectly plain to ensure that effective arrangements are established from liaison between the various departments of the County Council and the appropriate organizations such as the emergency services . I know what the emergency service is, I'm sure everybody else does. There's a fourth one that keeps cropping up on television but I mean we don't take that into consideration. But it's just police, fire and ambulance services, those are the emergency services, I can't see what, what the objection is to me making the paragraph stronger. No and I can't see wh no well I, we made it, I'm not against making it stronger, but I can't understand why this suggestion has been made. Well because of past experiences, Chairman, that's all. Let's make it strong I'm not criticising anybody, just make it stronger. Chairman, I, I, I'm really confused now, I mean they've, they've got me, they've got me talking about semantics here which is ridiculous. What we're talking about is the emergency services that sh that responds to the needs of those who are in difficulty or in distress. That's what we're doing and I can't see anything here that prevents er, total cooperation between A the police, B the ambulance service and C the fire services. I agree with you entirely. I think this is er, semantics, and simple nitpicking. The police have never, I mean the Fire Officer will tell me, has there ever been an occasion when the police have not cooperated with the Fire Service in an emergency situation? No No, no there's always room for improvement in liaison Come on we're talking about the job, the job description, really they're there to please, er, er, this is written by one, one man and er, or one woman, and we're just saying that the wording could be improved in that one little phraseology, that's all. On the job description. It was put together by, it was put together by the Chief Fire Officer and the Chief Executive er, not just the Chief Fire Officer. Right. I'm saying it could be improved, I'm sorry. Yes Colonel. Er, most officers would have accepted it and moved on to the next subject. Paragraph two was current solution to see the sort the place where the advertisers as widely as possible, presumably based on the job description . Here, there's no salaries attached to it at the moment. Erm, do we know how big the department's going to be, because that governs the salary? Where are we in relation to the sort of catch twenty two situation on this? The, the salary is stated I, I'd rather finish with the other question, or, or the made by the Major in the press question, are you, do you want to follow up the, I mean, have a vote on this if you want to? No Or is, or do you think the wording is suitable, or do you not? The wording's suitable. Yes I, I, I'm dead easy, I mean really it's a bit pedantic being pathetic. Leave it as it is, leave it as it is Leave as it is, and move on. Right now,c yes sorry, well we'll go back now. The, the post is currently graded at P O five, not P O six. After the exclusion of the public. Can we discuss after the exclusion of the public. Thank you sir. Yes Clearly er, it's er, again in, in paragraph four, under future budget of er, the services is going to be critical, if you've seen the last couple of years that are defined in the pay, and that's going to continue. As far as the short-term is concerned, er, part of the budget package in the current year, er, the retirement and the, the now proposal was to, to help up the side as regards that. Now it's referred in item one of the introductory paragraph, in the introduction about additional funding, and I just wonder where is the total for this additional funding? Is it from within the Public Protection Committee's overall budget, or is from elsewhere? If so, no. Well if we're going to start to go into funding, I'd rather this went into the pink paper session, and that we have our Chief Executives down here to explain that situation. I don't want to discuss this in open committee. Agreed? Yes. We'll put it as the last item. You have the situation Personnel, five, point one, sorry, five point one three is that right, so Er, five point nine I think Chair. Five point nine, optimistic, I'm getting terrible these days. Just a little bit optimistic,straight through to that, Yes, avoiding, oh yes, yes, yes, sorry, sorry. Avoiding, now What Future for Local Emergency Planning, National Conference. Now, I'm, I might have been remiss on this, but we had to do this in a hurry, erm, to get names in, and, but it's been suggested by erm, the leader of the er, Conservative group on, on this Committee, that erm, a, a, member from each should, major group should go, and er, I'm quite, I'm quite inordinate, in favour of this, if we can get erm, bookings there now. I'm, you know My feeling is Mr Chairman, it is an unpolitical er, erm, we're going Oh yes, yes into a new ground and, and er, I think it would be very useful if, if we yes, yes, I'm quite happy, providing we can get the erm Erm, I think I, yes Chairman, if, if, if you're prepared to attend that if you're saying that Providing that they're not all taken . No well that's, that's impractical and all, but You know it's, yes, yes. I don't know where it is. Okay are you all agreed? Yes, agreed. Are you going? Who's on transport? I don't believe this gentleman. We'll check, we'll find out before the end of the meeting. Thank you for our er, I've got a better one than those Five point one oh, annual inspection, am I right now? Yes, ten We know that Mr Chairman. Five point ten, yes. Erm, you're all aware of that? Five point eleven, Fire Safety Week, well that's gone past. It's quite useful We played on a different part Five point one, twelve, Brigade Festival at Cowes, an absolutely superb evening in my opinion, but somebody said it was bloody awful. Er, Well I think it was a marvellous evening. I think it was I can think of one c comment Chairman. The, they ran out of er, of carol sheets. We didn't expect c It,i I had the initiative in getting a prayer book, er, er, a hymn book from the back which er, after some concentration with the index or something, to er If you would pardon me on the sheet , it's a shame Mr 's not here, because that was his decision, because of the imposed cut in stationery from last year, we ran out of it Come on, come on Good for him. So he was sulking in a corner was he? Yes. Another criticism that I had was that it was far, far too elaborate and expensive programme, I thought it was a very cheap one. We printed it ourselves, Yes, yes The first one, was Yes, yes, Councillor . In spite of a lack of er, sort of er, carol sheets for, for some of us, it really was, as you say, a very enjoyable evening, and I was particularly erm, keen on the, the introduction of Saint Nicolas, and it certainly got smaller children, I think it was er, fantastic, and I certainly haven't enjoyed so er, I'll be back We diddled them out of er, Christmas presents which, which surprised me. But some of the children there erm, somebody must have been very, very, optimistic because we put a lot, a lot of presents in there, but anyway I think it was a superb night, and, and, and the meeting of er, to get together in the fire station afterwards, quite, in the Price Room was very good. Okay. Five point one three, five thirteen, Fire Brigade Long Service and Public Medals Ceremony. Once again a very enjoyable evening, erm, I pushed into something that er, I don't think she really wanted to do initially, but she thoroughly enjoyed it at the end. Chairman, she did it er, erm, very nicely,from the local That's right, that's right. The ladies concerned I think were very pleased er, erm, I do I think it's a very good idea, erm, to give a wife's medal and er, with all the medals, and we ought to provide money for them the amount of waiting about they have to do A very good evening. and they never know when Yes. It was a nice, nice gesture. A well organized evening. And where the beer did agree eventually, I mean under slight pressure. There's a photograph of her,and I'm quite sure we can give Joan to give to Vera one of those. Yes, yes thank you. I, I would like to see erm, I don't know whether this is done, but erm, when the official photographs are taken, they're done by erm, newspaper area, so that you get of the Lord Lieutenant, the Chief Officer, and the, the man from that area, and that is sent to the local paper, whether, ah in fact the local paper actually took photographs on that basis, and they grouped them by Yes, but erm, but Chairman, er, I don't think I should come up and make myself clear, some local papers were not represented there. Could they in future be sent? Could the photograph, the fire, the fire fighter probably won't think of it, could, could we think it for him, or her. Yes, we're lucky with the photographer actually, he's not a fire fighter, er, He is now He is now, okay. Er, five fourteen, paper L. Don has erm, been seconded to the Home Office for a period of two years. So I think we ought to congratulate him on that. Yes Hear, hear. And the other is the retirement of er, Divisional Officer . Could we just Twenty nine year service is a long time. can I be as could we be associated with that? Oh yes, well I, this is a Committee I'm talking about, not, not just myself, the whole Committee. Erm, when I speak, I speak on behalf of the whole Committee. A letter will be written to both on that? Yes, oh yes, yes. Okay. Chair, in respect of what erm, it's obviously it's er, good for the Authority that Mr is er, obviously , but what will happen to his post, right away, and what, will there be someone employed to actually fill in, I know there will probably be some moving up er,? Yes, we're interviewing so we're interviewing on Friday for somebody to fill that post. On the dates that you've anticipated if Mr comes back by that time we'll be able to absorb the post, but it's likely that he may move on from this, because it's a fairly substantial move up. In his next, next work when he leaves here he's going to be the Fire Service at the Houses of Parliament, and I'm serious, that will be one of his first major jobs. Not to mention things as trivial as Windsor Castle, and so forth. You don't sail that far down Will they listen to him, I hope. You're next authority. Chairman, he won't have to, it's like this, he won't have to worry as they did when the televisions which caused the last fire in the House of Commons, I mean, set fire to them and er, caused that one. It's quite er, it's quite a recommendation to de Brigade though isn't it Mr Chairman? And quite an honour to the brigade. Pardon? It's very prestigious, it's very prestigious. Yes, and I think I thought of a personal note that, because we do get some good, good appointments. As bad as we are. Okay we'll move on. No, I, I, I think, it is well done. Six, Quarterly Report of Chief Trading Standards erm, paper marked M. Yes Do you want to s enlarge on it Mr ? No No, no No you're alright Chairman. Can we note this Mr Chairman? There's quite a lot of useful information in here. I hope you've all read it. Yes I have, item, paragraph one, Mr Chairman, is right to do with the work that has to be done. Pardon? Pardon? Item one on M, Mr Chairman, the right of you with the amount of work that has to be done, and the amount of they're asked for Oh yes, yes okay. in growing demand or Six point two, deregulation. Chairman, if I could just er, erm, some words that aren't included in this pa paper, I understand that the Deregulation Bill is published on the eighteenth erm, and presented to Parliament for the first reading, erm, it's still far from clear what's going to be said in it, but erm, it's still widely expected that in fact, on major contentious issues will in fact be the suggestion that sections of Acts of Parliament will, could be revealed by ministerial order rather than go through the parliamentary process again. So it's an important issue er, of principle. The aspect to it is, as I've made clear in, in the, the report I hope,th they'd want to treat each erm, one that comes out of government on it's me merits. Er, I make the point I think that, erm, we should oppose the er, Deregulation Bill if it's based on providing deregulation by Ministers, because I think that's a constitutional point that is of great import, but the, the rest of it erm, are really sets of principles that I hope you'd agree to, subject to amen amendment and dis discussion, because the information that we got is that the consultation period is going to be very tight indeed, and that it might not be able to go through the normal committee procedures in order to put things through erm, with er, proposals in that, er, in that respect. If they're relatively technical, then I, then I'd be grateful if they can be left to the officers, but obviously if there's anything that erm, is political in anyway, big P or small P, then at least we can get in touch with the er, P A G, and if necessary call a meeting in respect Chair. But things are going to move on apace, and we need to, a set of principles the officers can work to, and I've put these down as a broad list, erm, for your consideration. I propose that Mr Chairman. All in agreement, Yes to the recommendations. Yes Paper O, That's purely for information Chairman. Paper P, genetically modified foods. I think the case is here is that er could have serious effects. That, er, Chairman, if I could say the thing that bothers me here is that, it always has done about food, is that we should be keeping up to date with information, all these decisions and all this advice. That seems to me a basic requirement of er, of all the sale of food. Er, it's been coming in gradually over the years, but there's been an awful lot of, of er, resistance by some manufacturers on what they say on their labels, and what they say about what they're selling us, and er, if they're gonna do this, and I'm getting a, a slight suspicion, and I think Mr is, that, that it's got to be done eventually, and we, we have to be able, as a buying public, to understand exactly what we're buying before we actually get it home. A chance to read, and be informed as to what we're buying when we buy it. Chairman, it's always been this Committee's policy over the twenty years, the twenty odd years that I've been here, back here ru runner, that erm, so far as the food side is concerned, er, we should be, our policy should be based on the information, the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and letting people make up their own minds. It's not been for us to tell people what they should or shouldn't eat or do anything with, because the, in, in one respect that's a nann nannying attitude from er, whether it's the legislators saying we're not going to approve the right legislation so that you have that information, but on the other hand by manufacturers and others saying you trust us. Well, in the cases we've taken over the odd twenty years against some of the biggest companies in the world indicate that that isn't the er, position. So, as far as the, the erm, erm,report is concerned er, if I've got to make a recommendation, because obviously people have got different views on this one, it would be in fact that we go for total er, information so that people can make up their own minds, and if, and it might be wrong, but they can exercise their own prejudices. And if they want to exercise those prejudices that's a matter for them. Erm, so that, that's the line that er, from a personal point of view I would erm, I would take, but I would obviously want members' views on that one. The other one, could I just correct something on the last line of er, comment at the bottom of the, bottom of page two. It says stock lives, it should be stock lines. But they are also trying to include the stock live aren't they, in some cases? Not their lives, No, it talks about the life as it's lying in store for instance. Yes, oh yes, yes indeed. Yes Anybody wish to speak or are you, do you accept the recommendations? A question if I may? In the er, appendix attached Yes er, there's talk about the er, government waiting for the recommendations from the Food Advisory Committee, when are they due? It's come out too, Chairman, that erm, there's been an, they dis they discussed that the minutes came out, and erm, what the Committee decided shortly was, the Committee felt strongly that, if the criteria for labelling were met, the requirement for labelling declaration should be a statutory one. They did not consider that this could be satisfactorily achieved by other means, such as non-statutory guid such as non-statutory guidelines. Er, based on the evidence which the public consultation produced the Committee considered that the primary concern of consumers was to be able to identify when a gene likely to be a cause of concern to a significant proportion of the population was present in foodstuff. This was reflected in the criteria which the Committee recommended should trigger a labelling declaration. As far as the form of labelling was concerned they believed that what was required was a simple declaration such as contains copies of X genes, in single ingredient foods and foods sold loose, they believe a declaration should form part of or accompanying the name under which food is offered for sale. For pre-packed foods which contain ingredients that contain copied genes, it recommended that a statement should be required to accompany the name of the ingredient in a list of ingredients. If a copied gene is present in an ingredient which was under current rules, it did not need to be listed, the declaration about its presence should nevertheless be made either in the ingredients list or next to the name of the er, food . And they went on then to consider lack of understanding of consumers about G M technology as a whole, and made recommendations for erm, er, better labelling, and for a erm, information campaign to be launched as well. But they didn't actually recommend that it should be statutory labelling Yes. The point I'd make, is that the difficulty of enforcement, in that respect. It's, it's one thing legislating, it's a completely different ball game when you are, erm, trying to enfor enforce it, and especially when you're trying to enforce it with ingredients imported from abroad. Well, when I say abroad, I mean from the E C as well. Erm, you can look after your own factories in this country, and you source ingredients, but you won't be able to do that for anything coming ov coming overseas. And the major manufacturers erm, there is a major trade in ingredients, between the multi-nationals as they pass things across. So the theory might not well work out in prac practice. But I honestly can't come up with any solution in that respect, because er, until you've got er multi-national enforcement agencies which no politician is going to agree to, erm, you're not going to solve the pro pro problem there. And if they think that it suits them to shift a factory to the Philippines because there won't be an inspection there, that's what they'll do. Can you note this Mr Chairman? That's depressing isn't it really? Very, but there you go. That's life, but we do what we can. And it's a statutory obligation in this country and that's really what you know. Because we can't just accept that, that manufacturers will look after it for us, because as you've, already said by the Chief, they'll move the factory where it I mean, you can even get a situation Chairman, where you'll get some of the big multiples will tell a, will agree specifications with a food manufacturer, but they're not going to be able to check on the ingredients, so even though the, the, the Sainsburys and the Marks and Spencers of this world say we don't want any er,gen genetically modified ingredients going into anything that we're going to buy, there's no way that they can guarantee that before we've even bought any. Having said that, do we accept the recommendations in this report? Yes Authorizations for legal proceeding. Proposed. Agreed. Registration of births deaths and marriages. It's for you Mr Nothing to add, er, if members have any questions I'll be happy to answer them. Noted? Charity Youth Committee, marked S. Do we have a member er, from that Committee? Yes Chairman, I am following in Major 's shoes, I don't reckon I know a great deal about it yet, and I'm not sure that this erm, er, advisory er, committee is yet actually on the go, but I will go into this. The stumbling block here does seem to be the inability of the Charity Commissioners themselves to keep up with the volume of work. Er, I am, Mr Chairman, I support that fully, because if you write to them it's six months before they'll reply. And you're wondering, I mean I don't think we can expect of the advice of charities now, or very little, you know, and, and they've got to be very, very careful I was meeting the Commissioners Pardon? I was leaving the Commissioners out as far as I could. Yes, yes, yes. It's a very meagre budget Chairman I should think we're getting off very lightly. Yes . Item nine, motion evenings and Saturday meetings. I propose that we retain the status quo Chairman. I'll second that I second that Are you all in favour of that? Yes West Mercia Police Authority, Paper C, now you received this late I'd be pleased to answer questions Chairman, and I'm sure Mr will help, help me deal with the budget crisis. And I shall endeavour to Well that's all you've got in front of you at the moment, isn't it, the budget Chairman? You have other things as well. Are there any questions? Pardon? Are there any questions, I'm asking, yes, I'm waiting for questions. Can I make an observation Mr Chairman, will you take observations as well? Yes, I'll take observat why, wait a minute. Yes, erm, on paragraph three erm, the, the last sentence erm, where it says without direct access to its own balances, the authority may therefore have to make revised precept in ninety four, ninety five erm, I understand what's being said there, but any organization needs to actually work within er, a clearly defined budget. Er, the Police Authority last year I think actually had to have an extra nine hundred thousand pounds of spending, the budget was funded by the constituent's authorities, erm, and we've already for next year in fact, made available effectively six hundred thousand pounds worth of extra spending by erm, various means, so I would hope that erm, the authority does use as, as much prudence and restraint in its financial affairs as possible, because of the, the effects on all, all concerned. Yes, Chairman, can I say that erm, when the b the budget's in the process of formulation and we're discussing the question of balances and reserves and how they should be marked for the immediate future, particularly in regard to the way that er, reorganization may take place at police authorities in the very near future, and also those of us who are on this, on, on other committees who've had experience in, and the same sort of thing happening in further education for instance, where immediately the assets, before even the regulations were put on the table, the assets of all these things were, all these er, erm,coll the further education colleges were frozen so we couldn't do anything with them at all as an Authority, and er, actually many of them were taken from us without er, without any question at all . So in the light of that it's per now is a good opportunity to er, make sure that those reserves and balances were available for A, the er, Police Authority should it require it, but B, to those constituent authorities who had helped in the er, build-up of these reserves. Now, what's being said here in that particular sentence, is that there are obviously going to be, or possibly could be occasions when er, the Police Authority has er, an overspend, which is an immediate problem for instance, on pensions, and you've heard the er, Fire Service Chief talking about his problems. They're just the same with the police force, there could be er, er, an increase in police pay,or there could be any, a very large incident which would require planning, if these happen then it has always been the case, if there wasn't the money available then a precept could be put upon us as a local authorities to er, cover that erm, directly. That's no different to what the situation is now, it was there before, the difference is that the banker is different. The banker is not the reserves of the Police Authority, because that has now been transferred to the authority. I should tell you that er, the budget really represents er, an increase in the availability of police resources over the previous years. I'm delighted with that, the budget came out er, much better than I'd hoped it would do, and er, and I, I am sure that we shall see some improvement in the police er, over the next year. Of course there is, there is the possibility, there is definitely going to be a reorganization, we shan't have the same sort of input I don't think, we shan't be allowed to have the same sort of input in a totally undemocratic er, er, authority that's going to be there where the, the governments will er, put er, most of the people on board, where the Home Secretary will decide on the Chairman, er, we don't know what the government regulations are going to say about balances in terms for the new authority. Er, if they say that er, they should be er, a balance or reserve put in by constituent authorities then we will have the money available to do that, if we didn't then they may have frozen the reserves that are already there and asked us to put some more money in as well. I find that is the situation that I've tried to er, guard against with the budget that we've been put in on this occasion, and I hope that answers er, er, Mr but er, I'll answer any other questions that are put up. Thank you very much. Could I say Chairman,in Worcester and Shropshire are in agreement with this budget and er, which has been engineered to a great deal by the Chairman of the Budget and er, we're here to, Yes I don't, I don't mind worked out, but engineered gives a very Regarding paragraph nine Chairman, no doubt you, you would tell us if there's been a response on this, because this does seem a useless step forward er, to increase the number of people at the coalface as it were, and self-financing, and no doubt we shall hear in due course about this. The Authority are pushing as much as they can on the scheme and there's been no response to yesterday. It's a crazy situation, because when Clarke was the Home Secretary, and he made a, a speech in parliament, we adjourned a meeting of the Authority to listen to him speaking, now we'd already made applications er, to increase the number complete officers by the, getting rid of the superintendents, and Clarke came out with what we'd said, yes, do that, but the Home Office are still saying no you can't. Er, I mean the whole lot separately, Yes, yes, I mean it's crazy. if I can comment on that Chairman, the erm, the Authority asked for thirty for next month, along with all the other authorities I think in the country, asked for an improvement in the, in the policing the country, and I think people that live in, in Shropshire, and the people that live in other er, parts of the country as well, would have welcomed the increase in the police force this year, but the government decided not to do that. We, we then had this situation where the, er, the Chief Constable ha went to great lengths to er, work out a new establishment for himself, and the senior management, and actually ach chi and er, and preempted it and then asked the er, the Home Office if he could use the money to increase the constables on the beat. We are still waiting for them to agree or not to that. The feeling at the moment is that they are sympathetic towards us, and they don't see any difficulty in that as yet, but no one is prepared to put their hand up and say yes go ahead and spend the money in that way. But the money is in the budget Chairman, I want to make that quite clear, the money is here in, in the West Mercia Police budget to be able to provide sixteen extra policemen immediately. Police Officers. Policemen immediately that that is given to us by the Home Office. I hope the Authority unanimously do support it. Yes, I think Chairman, you ought to ask your Committee to note paragraph six, I think that's quite important and worthy of note. Because we employ a lot of Can I record we've received this here Mr Chairman? Move the reports received? Yes. Now it is recommended that we in section nine and four A, in brackets four, someone move. Chairman, can he just report to us? Right, Chairman, if we can just go through this briefly. Erm, number thirty six. Erm, it contains access to four, five and they'll be submitted after discussion at this particular Committee, to Policy Planning or the Policy Resources Committee. As we've made perfectly clear in the last discussion we've just had, no final decisions on the implementation of any variations will be taken until Council meets on the twenty fifth of February. This booklet was distributed just before met, so in fact er, paragraph two does say at the moment that in our new recommended programme there isn't, well in fact they did agree those recommendations. In addition though, and we come on to them in a second, it asks for further reductions to be added to that if possible. But the provisional guid the guideline which was set by Policy and Resources in the first instance, was just for this Committee to identify seventy thousand pounds' worth of reductions. Those reductions were those identified in paragraph three and perhaps I do need to point out in fact that according to the report in Policy and Resources Committee, the use of carry forwards from the registration service of twenty thousand pounds in fact needs to be replicated across all three years. Now quite clearly that has er, implications on the registration service and believe the County Secretary will talk about that at some future point. Erm, paragraph four erm, outlines there is a gap after these new guidelines of six hundred and seventy one thousand, and to bridge that gap, the P and R asked that er, the Fire and Rescue Service identify a hundred thousand pounds of sur of reductions from its budget. The audition which is the additional item includes moves at Policy and Resources Committee that they asked all committees to expose further reductions if possible to help close this gap of six hundred and seventy one thousand pounds. Just find it on the kind of introduction. The other guideline which was issued was namely that of capital, where the a accepted the general guidelines which appeared in the county papers and as far as this Committee was concerned, would mean the general acceptance of all those items which appear in that the first year of that capital programme, subject to the proviso that the revenue contemplated and the benefits of the capital programme will be considered by Policy Panel in its forthcoming meeting. As far as the introduction is concerned I have nothing more to say. I am, unless there are any questions, can we not then five, move on to number five? Er, one question if I may Chair? Erm, I note that on paper R earlier, we er, approved the recommendation to ask Resources Management sub-committee to approve the release of three thousand of registration service carry forward monies, and we're now being asked to approve our budget next year, which er, also reduces twenty thousand for registration service. Can we be told please exactly what the er, balancing hand of carry forwards shown on the right estimates, the twenty three thousand consists of? Are they, what, what are those are registration services? That, the thirty three thousand includes twenty three thousand of the registration services carry forwards, but it does not take into account the three thousand which have just been requested here. So that would reduce it down to twenty. I just want to make sure we have the money now. If you, if you like, I could speak now Chair? Yes Er, naturally we're disappointed you're proposing to take er, twenty thousand of our twenty three thousand carry forwards in the registration service. The problem is as Mr has said, if that is expected to be replicated across future years, this would represent a ten percent reduction in the statutory service, er, which is only partly under control of this Committee, with mixed responsibilities with the Registrar General. Seventy percent of the expenditure is on staff who you do not employ and cannot dismiss, a large part of the income, or all the income is through the fees that are set na nationally by the government. You have very little room for manoeuvre within this service, and the Registrar General has reserve powers to impose services on you, and I would have to advice you it would be virtually, or I would have to say it would be impossible to achieve that ongoing reduction in future years. Erm, does the Chair wish er, me to reach section by section, or do you wish to take the bookings as they are Chairman? Well I think we've got to take it section by section. In that case the, the white page which isn't numbered at the back of page three, is the revised estimate, and shows the variations as outlined there. Erm, the only variations which are actually going outside the Committee control are as a result of the internal market variations which are going on down . Plus of course the growth in the Firemen's Pension Scheme of thirty one thousand in the current financial year, rising in future years. Otherwise the Committee services are containing their budgets within original cash limits. If there are no questions on the revised estimates Chair, then the, the base budget for ninety three, ninety four are those outlined on the green pages, identified it certain service by service. It's on these figures which in effect any Committee reductions will be made. I have nothing further to say on the green pages. Do members have any questions? Okay, does anybody Before, before you go on, you say that the twenty thousand can't be rep replicated in income registration column, does that show, how would show in here then? It doesn't show, it doesn't show in here, no. If the registration service was erm, asked to ma to reduce its budgets for ninety four, five and future years, by twenty thousand, it could do it in to three, four, five because it would bring forward twenty thousand pounds worth of carry forwards. However in five, six, its net expenditure would reduce to erm, two hundred and twelve thousand pounds. And from what County Secretary's just said, we would be unable to identify reductions in statutory service to live within that cash and The salmon pages then Chair, are those items which have been put forward to achieve the guidelines set by Policy and Resources Committee. In additions, I would remind members of the request from Policy and Resources to try and identify wherever possible further savings, in aid of the six hundred and seventy one thousand pound gap which currently exists between budget proposals and the expected figures. Any, yes Mr A couple of comments on that Chair, the first one, on the reduction in carry forwards, my understanding is that, in fact it's quite amusing in some ways, because this, this is something I was accused of as Chair of Resources Management during my year. Er, what in fact this Committee is doing, is saying that at one of the sections that makes up part of it, you happen to have carry forwards spare from last year, therefore use them because we can't identify anything else in budget savings for this, next year. Erm, that isn't necessarily the same as saying by the way your section will have to repeat that saving in future years. I think it's quite legitimate for this Committee to take that twenty thousand because it's there, and to say to itself, post budget we will have to look at the whole of the areas covered by budget protection to find the replicated twenty thousands in future years, and not just expect it to come from registration. Erm, from the comments from the table that seems to be generally agreed. Yet the point, it's a question really, which refers back to the last programme summary three, of the, the ninety four, ninety five base budget. Within that we're, we identified a gross expenditure and a gross income across all areas of the Committee's work. Now clearly some of those are, are outside our direct control. Nevertheless there's five hundred and fourteen thousand as our income that the Fire and Rescue Service, the Fire Training Unit, from the Trading Standards Department, and from Emergency Planning. My question is, has the P A G looked at any ways of increasing any of that income to any degree at all? And if so, what were their findings? We have reviewed charges on, and the Fire Service, erm, in the past, and, and we've increased certain erm, but we didn't see any way we could, we could increase any more at that time. So far as Trading Standards is concerned Chairman, the major income are weights and measures testing fees and they are set down by LACOTS, that's Local Authority Courts on Trad on Trading Standards on er, an agreed scale, so we charge exactly the same as other authorities, for the same, for the same work, and we increase the fees every year, er, in line with erm, the recommendation. Er, the amount that we get, get in depends on erm, the amounts of trade and industry. We've done relatively well in the past couple of years because we've had a lot of petrol pumps, because of the new, the opening of the big supermar the, the supermarkets where there's thirty, forty pumps go going, we make a fair bit of money in that way. But you can't guarantee that, er, and once the supermarket developments er, have gone, then you'll drop off down, down again, and again you're affected by the rece recession, whereas people won't replace things like weighbridges, er, automatic weighing machines that sort of thing during the recession, if you come out of recession, then you might get, and you say you might get some increase in fees in that, that area. But those are always considered er, during the erm, er, revised estimates time in any way. The other one and that erm, the major source of income are court, court costs, and again that depends on the cases you're taking, it depends on the, on the amount awarded by er, magistrates. Over the years, we've taken the risk to increase the court's costs, erm, where we've got agreed pro er, principles, and we've b we've been able to go to the courts and they've agreed with us, for instance, standard fees for overloaded vehicle cases, we charge seventy pounds a time. Er, and the courts by and large agree to erm, give us the seventy pounds out ev every time, but even so, even if we get the award of the costs, then the difficulty is, is, is in getting those costs in. Erm, it's up to the magistrate's clerk and sometimes the first So it's in the Fire Service that we've actually got time posted, and in fact most of the things that we wish to charge for we're actually statutorily prohibited from doing. Things like false alarm calls and so on, have been through the courts and we've been stopped from doing that. We charge the highest rate in the country for issuing fire certificates which is one of the few things which we're actually allowed to charge, and we charge more than virtually any other authority in this country. The trouble about that is, it's now enforced upon us and that's official target, we have to set priority of fire certificates because we need the money, bluntly, otherwise we have to find it elsewhere, so we give them a priority that they wouldn't otherwise have. Er, in terms of training, commercial training and it's not just the Fire and Rescue Service I spoke recently with the Chief Ambulance Officer, who's experiencing the same problems. Training's the first thing that goes, in a recession, that's the first thing that people cut, and not only, well we are achieving the fixed amount of income that we're obliged to in order to make previous reductions, but we're certainly not covering costs. So what you're effectively doing at the moment is subsidizing the private commercial sector. Erm, everything else we've looked at, there are either statutory problems or other problems that prevent us from charging. So it's, if further income generation is limited, it's through external circumstances rather than any internal increases. So we've really, we've really no alternative but to accept the hostage three, one to three on the reductions. It's best as I see it. Erm, salmon paper. We, we've got not alternative, did you say? Well I, I think that that's exactly what the Committee was saying to the Minister there. No, no. We, we, I thought were all saying that we felt that these reductions were actually unacceptable, or totally un almost unacceptable. Erm, there's not a word that's suitable to use actually in this case because we find that they would actually impact upon the service in a serious manner and therefore we don't, Well put it this way, if we were compelled to find the savings they ask, that is the only way we could do it. That's right, we need to put that rider on, that, that we would hope that, obviously would look favourably at er, erm, removing these restrictions on our service if at all possible. It's only specific in item two. Specifically in item two, yes, sorry. Yes, yes, yes. Chair, Sorry, one and three I, I, I think that we've, I, I certainly couldn't accept. We've got to accept the implication of, of item three though, in future years. I think, I think Council is accepting this but I think it's You're changing battle ground there Mr Chairman, to be honest. I think what Mr has said, is quite right, is that this is a carry forward for this year, and er, we've, we're clobbering it taking it up really is what we're saying. So what he's saying we've got to discount it So what he's saying is Next year we wouldn't have a, erm, look and see whether that twenty thousand is coming from the local authority, it's not necessarily in that particular money It's not our calls So what we're saying, or in item, well the last item, implication of further service reduction, with that twenty thousand pound on Fire and Rescue Service will be applicable for this year only? We've said that will be acceptable in P A G Chairman? It's not acceptable, it's not acceptable Chairman, we agreed in the P A G, it wasn't acceptable. It's been spelt out. We threw that one out then. Mm, yes. No way. But it's in, but it's in here isn't it? So we put a, as a rider on, that it had already passed the rider it says there, but we found it unacceptable at P A G. for we're offering them If it has to be found that's the only way. But to us it is unacceptable. Is the exception applied to two? Yes, So we've got to in Trading Standards? Yes, yes, yes. Trading Standards however important, and Trading Standards is very important, erm, when you're getting down to erm, reductions in equipment and uniforms and men, then lives are at risk, it is really a matter of er, er, of, of for our fire fighters that they have the right equipment and the right uniform and when it actually comes down, you can't compare that to maybe reductions in Trading Standards. If, if I can support that Chairman, and what John said also. That's why we couldn't, when we talked about it earlier, use the same word unacceptable, on both item two under Fire Service reductions. Because the Fire and Rescue Service reductions are unacceptable, and I think this Committee should say to, and to leave that in its proposal to Policy Panel and P and R. What things? But when it comes to the Trading Standards Board, what we're saying is, if P and R and Policy Panel this Committee finds seventy thousand pounds' worth of savings, then clearly item two represents a way of doing it. But it represents a way of doing it which is not what the members of this Committee, of all three parties I suspect, want to do. And we would therefore strongly urge them to consider that, and not to take that saving unless it was sort of necessary. Okay. Sounds reasonable to me. Are you all in favour of that then? Yes, as long as this possibly isn't major that we do not agree on? Well the Chairman Are we? So we're all in favour? Yes Right. Capital programme Chair, is that outlined in erm, on the pink pages, if members have any comments to put to David Aha It's er, courtesy, common courtesy. yes, and not going out to find your own knowledge really. You reach a point where you're not certain, then be big enough to say, I don't know, but I can phone our man who does. Absolutely, absolutely no problem. Right, let's get Can you park at the back? Carol, or not? N , er, no, probably no, because we've just, we've just got, we've got three spots, which are ta , are taken most of the week you see, so it's just a bit yes. It's only a very short walk down, if you walk through the shops you don't have to go all the way down, you can actually come, just walk past that shop and go down the middle, and you come out through the car park . Are we ready? Smokers? I've never been on tour, but I've been to the visitor's centre, and Yes. Erm, on page eleven, there's a chart where Because you can all get these things like Guy Fawkes for, but also transcripts for. Welcome to the last session of the day. Yes, er, and we're looking at living assurance. yes Can I explain all those booklets that I've put out on the table? First of all, there's two booklets here, one's a Covermaster and one's for living assurance, which has got your questions answered at the bottom. It's very good for revision, because it's the type of thing your clients are going to be asking you, and it's the type of thing we're going to be asking you tomorrow. So it's a nice way of revising tonight. It's similar to C V T, you really haven't got any notes technically today, so it, it's nice, erm, booklet to use. There's also the living assurance one the same with questions answered. I've also given you a living assurance rate book, because we'll be looking at both the rate books in a minute. And the living assurance, the guide to er, the illnesses that are covered. The critical illness, just a very brief guide there. I think we'll need a box. And a pen, one of those each. One of those each, and finally erm, a circular put out by Abbey entitled Women at Risk, which we'll be talking about. yes Right, so yo , you watched er, Dr. Marius Bernard, erm, the South African, what did you think about the message that came across in the film? What did you think about critical illness assurance? The importance of insurance. It's a very powerful message isn't it? I mean think er, life assurance erm, obviously it's the to have fails, but if somebody is eligible for, and can afford living assurance, it's got to be a brilliant product. I would think there must be a large part of people out there that could benefit from their estates isn't there? I'm, I'm never You're absolutely right, Philip. O dismissing the driver, mental picture of the, this chap in a cock cap and that, and your dad saying alright James it's enough I'll walk back I don't know how long you'll be in there, but I'll just go off now to er, old well I said well you mean are you?

Tha that's why I'm a bit concerned about messing around s straightening and that sort of thing, cos I'm sure I've had this problem before I'm sure that it reduces a lot of er Yeah, but you've still gotta do it. You still gotta move stuff around ain't you? Yeah, well what I do is I delete it Tidy it up. Yeah. and then I draw back in. Cos afterwards Yeah, but then if you run this your ri Yeah but , I think if you straighten lines and mess around with them too much it leaves little bits in underneath the other one. Yeah but there's not a lot of difference in the amount of time is there? By the time you've you've moved them all rather than drawing them all in again then you run the con activity and swop back. Cos you're gonna have to run con activity anyway. Well it's just down here with the plate And another thing is to is to to run con activity before you output the plot. Yeah. But a little short thing like that isn't gonna hurt is it? No. Leave that. Right. Okay. Er, what else is there? There is , that's the er crystal. Yep! That's good! That's right. Which had been forced. Yep. I'll just show you what was on there before. See they're not fully connected. No. Move back. Right, okay, let's have a look. It looks okay. Better colour, alright? Er, so which one shall we . Yeah. dunnit? I can't see anything wrong with it to be honest. Signal feed back is non-reflectives. Is it because this package has been messed around with? And that thing should be a a bra , a main No. pin? No? Right! Interesting! Right, I'll show you this. Hang on sec , I'll just look in Right, it's here right not fully connected right? Now Yeah. the problem here is between this point here right? Which is one of them, and I'll go over there, this is one of them. So the thing is And there. Yep. There right? And There. there. So it's between it's just on that bit there? Yeah, and also this S this bit here, which which I was Signal being traced, three nine four thousand. That blue trace there and this blue trace here it says there's a problem stubbing it. If you mark it, delete it and re-draw Yeah. there's not another one underneath. So I dunno why it's causing a problem really. Stubs in signal. It's not a trace, that those co- ordinates it's Bib bib Sorry, can I just interrupt? Mark darling, have you Barbara's address in Felixstowe? I was looking for the same thing yesterday ! Were you? Yeah. Cos I er you know she sent a thing, well I you know you sent the thing with the address and I Yeah. well I lost it! Okay. I had to get si , see I was gonna give it to you.

Yeah, ah well no, I couldn't find you and erm Mick said you were on leave so I had to send it, and I didn't have the address so I had to go and ge , see George. Can you hang on a minute, Bedge? Yeah.

Should be able to remember it, it's erm Barbara I've got it somewhere but and it's erm yeah , haven't got a postcode though. I'm sure it'll get there. I might be going swimming at lunchtime today so I could probably run up there or put it in the post if I go. Alright mate. Oh yes, but I mean I've finished That's the trouble really innit? Yeah, that's a problem innit? I keep telling the other one than that. No, apparently yo , racialism is the worst part! Well yeah! Ta , talking to other people who've done the course. Yeah, but I'm finding this I'm doing this patterns thing and it's all about transformations and that, and I, and there's so much gobbledegook with it that I'm I'm ge I'm getting lost my mind is getting lost in the gobbledegook Cos I know what Have you watched the programme? Watched the programme? I ha , I missed it , I missed it! I missed it Sunday. Saturday and Sunday. It's good! Did you video it? Yeah. Oh I'll look at the video if you taped it. As long as you can er it back. Put it back. Yeah. Cos what I'm doing, I put them on a series and keeping them for revision. Yeah, well that's what I was planning to do but I was o Oh. I've go , I was away in Ashford Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. It's this Saturday. No. This is it, I've gotta You can borrow it as long as you promise to bring it back. Oh well if you let me have it this week I'll let you have it back at the weekend. Yeah, I'll bring it in tomorrow. Okay, right. I better take the tab out the video otherwise he'll erase it! Not that I don't trust him or anything! I think what it is Yeah. I don't think, when you draw this trace perhaps it went just over the pin and didn't click it down. Ah, but when it's actually done it'll be connected won't it? Yeah. . Aha. I'd like to get this out the way really cos then I can get on to something else. Something Yeah well the mega stream is flying upwards. Oh we're on that now are we? Yeah. I thought it was the tester yesterday. Tester? Yeah. What the tester? Yeah. No, forget that! Oh God ! Wish you boys would make your minds up! One minute it's one thing, and then it's another! It's not my fault! It's er erm change of priorities. Did he go to tutorial last night. No. Oh my God! You not go tutorial! No. Oh, bad boy! They had er he forgot to video the programmes, so he's gotta borrow my video. And he didn't have the address either he's lost his sheet ! You call your report files the same as me. Rep Oh, I call it I call mine. Con No. I call it Co ,Con yeah. Con Sta, and Rep Yeah. Yeah, but why do you want to see the the T V programme, it's useless! No, it's not. It's very good actually! Oh, cracks me up, cos of it doesn't Yeah. it doesn't erm develop if you like, it always stays the same. So they show all these really old videos and these guys Yeah, that's right. are walking round with flared trousers and things! Brilliant! This guy, his flares must of been sort of No, no yo yo i isn't it funny when I thought it is a fault, one of them discarded the right? And they mapped it in Summer School Yo you remember it? Yeah.

And he's Yeah. he's quite a because Quite old, yeah. er, he said because of er the programme being how he used, you see his funny long hair!! Yeah, a tie you could make a suit out of! And I've got this bloody window stuck ! What? Ah go Gone off the top ! Well just click on the on pop-up so you get a a new a new window. I can't. Only in er Bullmaster one. Oh, you shoved it up sc , oh! I can't get into the banner to move it! Well put er, hit fault. Default. What do you mean? What are you talking about? What do I wanna do fault for? Shut up! Oh no don't hit the middle fucking bollock Too late! Mark ! Oh it's brilliant innit! That ought to do it! That's alright, just do a control C. Yeah, just do a control C,! No I wanted a There you go. We we'll laugh ! Fucking hell ! Wanted to do a That's brilliant! Exactly the same problem again! Don't ever Oh God! Too late! Mark, you should say what you're going to do before you do it! I got no S S T talk today? No. Ain't those batteries run out yet Mark? Well I se No. see they're still working. Yeah, just about. What you got round your neck for then? Just a poser Well when he pisses off I can put the radio on can't I! You're just a poser ay Mark? Sorry? Put your radio on. Keeps turning it on when you see it now. Well I can't hear what he's saying then can I? Well you can't fucking hear anyhow! You still hit the fucker when he says don't! No, he says it too late! Should always say it like at least half a second earlier. There's loads more now, look at this lot! Yeah I know. They're all the with er Eric. Oh I got rid of that one. Doo doo The V back one right? Yeah, but they're they're not really a problem are they? Because this one As long as it , as long as it goes in Yeah. onto that thing. Yeah, but you really should I mean A D characters not traced right? You really should check those. Oh I have checked them. But I was, I just bought you down here just to have a look. Oh right. Erm I was . which report bar's that the Con one? I just ran Con again and to add the new bar to see if that be back one disappears. Hang on a minute! Er type the or moor the er con You will see more. Cos it o , there's erm a set up safe I didn't see eighty four before. There's a set up that checks a certain amount of areas and then blanks it otherwise you could be sitting there for hours waiting for a new Con activity so you just chew them off bit by bit. Right? Oh, so that isn't all the problems then? No. Ah! So once you've chewed those you should run it again? Yeah. Oh I didn't realise that! We should run it again anyway! Ah! So,you gotta run it again haven't you? Yeah. Well I haven't had that problem before though. Cos you've never run it again have you ? No, I do. No, I do, I do normally I I'm pretty careful. The thing I was getting so pissed off cos I've run it about ten times now, cos you keep coming and do alterations! Oh God ! Andy says, oh we've gotta add a new buffer in here so I'm shifting stuff around and adding capacitors and Right. De dum , ay? Ah ee! That's your boss! Listen boy ! I don't fucking know! How the hell am I supposed to know where he is! They're looking for you! It's like asking me where Justin is! ! He's at college today isn't he? Oh that's good news! Supposedly, he should be, yes! That's different! He must love Tuesdays so it means he can have an extra lie in bed! They don't start till nine do they? That's a lay in? Well to be honest well if he he Wanna see something clever? Go on. Little window up here right? The thing about co-ordinates why? You get a little cross in that window Mm. then zoom. Oh isn't that lovely! Look! you can see it's That's lovely! Cos what I tend to do is I do a full board there find out Yeah. where it is and then zoom. Yeah. So you've, actually saving Clicked up on the C N C. Yeah, just turn all items off in that window all full board right? And then, what a so, you get a huge star there you just zoom around about erm Isn't that lovely! and you're there. And can you zoom off? Experience mate! Can you zoom in on that window then? Or is that always full board No it's type window? it's exactly the same window as this, you can edit in it, you can do everything. It should go past the window. So how do you how obviously you do you have the cursor in here when you hit zoom? Yeah. And then you go in there. And then yo , you edit box in there. If you had it in there it would actually zoom that way? Yeah , I mean if you go erm if I go zoom here right? And then, quickly here That does that, right. Right? But then if I go zoom in here Oh I see. and I go into that pad, say Single level three. and you can't see it cos I got all items on but Yeah. you just get a picture of that pad there So the all items on and off are completely separate from the two windows? Yeah. And is on? Yep! Wonderful! I like that! It's just one of those little things you learn when you working on as many bloody years as I've been now! No, I've never used an extra window. Yeah. I ha , I do in Ace but not in Bullmaster It's just a good way to mark it. But ones like this to me, I think they're cos if you Yeah. just lay the trace over the top of the pin it doesn't come out. Yeah. Yes, that should physically click on the pin to get the wire to connect. Oh I do! Do you? Mm mm! And then do a But in terms of, in terms of actual copper, I mean it is actually when the, when the plotter goes over that pad that is gonna be connected. Yeah, but it's still worth checking though. Oh yeah! But I mean they can be left can't they? Yeah. It's pointless trying to output them again. And you hear what say yesterday isn't it? What's that? You just only a piece of little metal. Ha! Sorry? In lunchtime you come in here and say whe where's the board? Oh! I thought it was in, you said oh! Piece of little metal is! Yeah, he's er gotta look out that guy ain't he? Yeah but Well he's stupid over everything! When you skive, you skive you don't let people know you're doing it! But we tell him, long, long time and he just well said well yeah, yeah! That's it. And totally honest. Don't,, I mean what I trying to help him you know the guy he's in work Yeah, I've already looked at that one it's alright Bedge. Yeah, but some people won't take advice will they? Well tha , that was very rude to come fucking , a lot of things and he just say Told him, yeah. If he'd he'd have got I had a go at him the other week using a fucking hire car! He took his car down to the actually ! It was a hire car? I don't mind if he asks you, he says look I'm just gonna go over stores , he took it off fucking site, didn't even know that's where he was going! Yeah, oh I know! Stupid burk had gone on a crane like that Yeah, yeah! tell him to fuck off! He's had it now! Yeah and you're responsible for it. But I've gotta be responsible for it. Yeah. Bastard! He was none too happy! Ha, God ! How can, how many ? I'll be very surprised if . Must be bloody ! Especially if this thing . Yeah, it's If they chop it off as well, I said they fucking blinding you like hell you'd have Well yeah and yeah! I bet he'd speed it up! Cor it's a lot slower when you want another network innit? The old monster! Oh good it's one slade one now. Yeah, Mm. Well no you're well it's, it's a stand alone, but all your files are not Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! What you got? I think that's . I just did that. Oh right. See you also get the bit up there with signals in this don't you? don't give a shit! Mm. And window. Oh it's lovely dovely They're all the pins and the veers that it goes through. Yeah. All the pins. No veers. Ah ! Ooh! Oh ho ho the whole lot ! Well we have got Take this backwards ! erm You can't . He said all about four days left to get this tested then up and running. Yeah, Frank knows it's gonna slip. It might, I've gotta Erm So that I'm actually full time after today. He can't of done! So get me to do it, it's only Yeah. gonna be me and Paul fixing all the design and that on it Yeah, he says . and you Right. hopefully. You'll be giving us It's gotta have a shelf so it'll be a whole drawer won't it? You done all the converting? Yeah I mean we did the fourth but I haven't done the ball to be honest on this one. I started reading up on it. You know I've done all the schematic components. Oh like getting thirty four bars to a hundred. And how do they do it? There shouldn't be that, there shouldn't be that big a board really should it? Well you get Yeah, but the trips he's using are big. Is it on his own or what? Should be something like that type of board. Well I hope it's . No, well no we're not using the LCC's, using dips. What are they, forties? Forties and thirty twos, I think. Well there's only a what One of them's and all. Yeah, but you've got all your microcircuitry on there. We're gonna have a R S fifty two, erm H D L C Ah course, that's not showing is it? That's right. So you got those Oh it'll be a double euro then. At least. I've got a box for a double euro card. Don't wanna tell them they're se , they're gonna smoke. Get on doing work will you? Erm I've gotta wait for Andy, I dunno what the fucking hell he's done! It should be documented. Cos if you got in by bus this morning ain't he? Well . I should do that. And it keep saying and it keeps saying there's a what erm slabs of concrete to be defined. Oh! Oh! Every single thing will be . That's not perfect though! That one's coming back already. No! You knock it off by, what was it? Er was is it? You're supposed to curl it up in a, in a erm in a brush when you blow dry it you know. Keep the perm in there. I'll give you a blow job! Did you ever see me when I had mine permed? What, yours? You never fucking You! did! You never had it in a fucking You remember when I had a perm don't you? Oh yeah, you looked a right tart! I looked a cunt I remember that ! I looked a complete asshole ! he had a fucking perm! You didn't see me then? It was like it wasn't as long as Bedgeys but it was really tight and really you know? Cos his is like I dunno Sweep How his is How his is Sweep! How long ago? But mine How long ago? Oh erm before I was married. About five years ago. Five, six years ago. God I don't believe it! Bloody was as well! I bet you looked a lovely boy! Of course, you haven't got enough hair to perm you know ! That's what I say! No, it was, it was quite long. You must admit , my hair is the worst,fa falling out since! No, got quite, quite a nice perm. It's thickened it up at the front innit? You think he's joking!

When I first met him it was really curly you know, and I Bu just thought it was his natural hair but Yeah but my my my perm is not the really the curl, like hi his was set nicely. Not like what bloody curly all hair! People must er think you're a pratt! I did! No, not Bloody Chine China men always have straight hair don't they? No,i it's not really what curly perm, is just like the er er a wave perm in it. Oh wave, yeah. Ah lovely! was saying. Have you Well photograph of it? Yes, I have tha , the really horrible one? That's true! Brilliant! The wedding photo At least mine's natural! Ha! Ish The wedding one a what, you know. The two mark co-ordinate windows. Yeah, one for one end, one for the other. Yeah what I do is, I have specified so I If I suspe the numbers are quite close I put one in there have that, and I just do reverse around and you Yeah. can see the other one might rub off. Do you know why I back to Norman ? Yes. Norman? Won't be much. Won't be now , he's a Londoner he's bound to have had one! You must have a ! Yeah, but I won't say! What's the problem? You have to hit it again. Well to be honest I got too many bloody windows up there! I got Ace up there now you know. So you aught to be careful! Alright. Why? Too many windows, it'll crash! Well that's alright. Well you can open There it is. It's that one and it's that one colour. Well I'm sure it'll be alright Bedge . It'll be alright on the night. Fucking airline now! Well that's alright innit? Hope it's not fucking connected Well I ra work ! If you go on a st If you go on a stat it says no airlines! How do you account for that? What? You look at stat which I just ran this morning right? My file called stat it says zero airlines. Don't beli Did you just delete that? No. No I didn't fucking touch it ! You didn't? Well what's that? No, oh. Have you put a different file name in? Nope! Just do more stat and it'll say zero. Total length of airline, zero. So I sa , I took it that that was it. Now more the one you just did. I just did. No, it couldn't be. You ju erase it, it won't allow you to over , overwrite it. Got to take them out the root. See so that's why you should check the con activity you see. Ah! You always didn't I they tell you? I do, that's why, I always do. I do stat, con and rep after I've done D L C. No I wasn't about to go down and do the bizz Tell him off! Bedge, come on, tell him off! You've gotta be able to run a little tidy up programme, we should just get rid of all these stubs and things! It's like, tell us what's in the software. Er Come on Bedge! So you're tell him off! Good job we ran this innit? Yeah, if it'll . Now what was the file you called when you ran sa when you ran stat I called it stat I'm sure I did. No. Put it in the box. In there. Hang on. Kick the mother fucker! No, woh! No, hang on! Hang on a sec ! I just wanna see if it's been erased since we've been digging around. Probably has you see. Right, okay. Point select. Forwards er No airline! Why don't you run with airlines on all the time? Well I've got confused! Well if i if it comes up and tells me there's no airlines there, then I can assume that there's no airlines! That's right! It didn't! It said there was zero air , that means th there's none there. What do you mean none there? Well there's one there now cos we just connected it. If you a, right I reckon what's happened, you've done a delete on a signal at some point right? And it hasn't been pulled up on the airline? No, you've when you do a delete erm if you do con ex signal, if you have that on signal it deletes the whole signal, airlines and all. I always have it on sig as much as poss . It defaults the sig That's, that's usually what happens. Anyway that doesn't solve the problem now anyway! Oh my God! So we gotta do the bloody thing again anyway! Yeah. Do you want me to put this one in or do you want the other one to go in? I wasn't told! ! Well I I mean I was, I was relying on the, on the . It's, erm, didn't you do these things like erm join the numbers up when you were a kiddy Yeah. You know, in these little books? It's just like that. That says that said to me zero airline so I thought ah great, it's all connected! You know? Well the con activity test told you it wasn't! Well I hadn't got through that had I? I would have discovered once I'd been through it all. Good Lord! Ooh no! Ooh no! That one's get it like that red well that number's moved. Yeah. It goes blue, green, blue, green, blue That's a bit of alive. Hang on! Blue, blue, green Boo ber ber ber ber ber . Right, that's green. Blue. We bring that one red down there. Doo doo . Move these around. We can go no we can't cos of that. This'll be a good one! Do you want to do it? Yeah, I can do it. ? Ow I mean we might as well pitch it now. Pitch those plots. Hang on a sec ! Wha what's happening here? That can come right down here and then blue underneath. Pull that one down. Well I just wondered why it goes there, in It could go down one couldn't it? It goes hold that. Well it's as broad as it's long really. Mm. That just says a bit. Mm, no. It just means changing it. This is the same thing though? Yeah. A bit devious isn't he? One things gone down there. Well Mark did it didn't he! Well the problem is, is that you don't like teeing off do you? Don't like teeing off signals. It's gotta be Yeah, you could of done come off at a pin. So Yeah but you could of come across Well I couldn't from there I remember working on that one and I did it because all this lot was a ,. I just pulled it up from that bottom. Probably this again. Oh but you see It's alright, look I mean that one Hang on! Yeah, but I mean that one you could of shifted this lot put some kinks in this one a bit, right? Moved all that lot up. Yeah but I don't like putting kinks in! You could of gone round with the kinks It's horrible! The kinks Well yeah but it's better tha , I mean that's that's like a bus signal and that's like a ser ,this one that's going round. Is that now? That straight? What you doing? That straight? What's straight? That light. Which one? That one. That one isn't. I know that one isn't! That it's an zoom delete it. This is difficult really. They're gone now. Look! Look at that! Alright! Don't fuck about! Oh no Mrs! Oh No! Gotta go! No. It's gotta go! No. You don't think ahead that's the trouble! I do! You're a cunt Bedge! Patronising bastard! You gotta think head! I think head everyday! You've left a C print on there. Hang on! You've left a It's alright! C pri I'm getting the poxy bloody grid! I why do I have to work with that grid? Cos you can see what you're doing then. Oh! No, it's all naughty and I find the horrible! if you have the grid on you don't miss airlines. I believe you! There's a segment there left! You just make sure What the hell did that jump across there for? There's a fucking segment on there! I told you there's a bloody segment, and does he listen? No! He well he never listens He just goes and clicks the bloody buttons! he never listens to you anyway Bedge ! Look! If the Ah it's still a bloody segment innit? my God! That's awful isn't it? Ah! And look at that! Look at these D L C's you put in there look! That's gone, right! Let's just do board delete that'll probably help won't it? Okay, so I'm coming from here You delete up to there! What's that? Oh it's the big airlines. Yeah, yeah, that's the one yeah, right. Ah like a bloody I'll leave you at it! I'm glad to hear it! God! Run you over! I'll get it sorted and I will do it again! Cor, I dunno ! Look Dave, look! Clever boy! Charge up my batteries cos of my aeroplanes. Oh you're into Got my charger. aeroplanes are you? I'm into model aeroplanes, yes. Oh dear! Well , not recently but I'm hoping to get back to it. When I er when I get the time. Yes, yes. I'll have to From the Hollies take . the Hollies Yeah. Well the trouble is they're so small now aren't they? Yeah. Because they restricted the area so much if you got a big plane that like, to by pass now. It's all gone again now. There was one Don't have a lot of time to think,You know ! there was one bloke over in erm tha you know, with a man la , that I used to work with and he, he used to fly from Hollies , and he lost his plane one day and fle , flew out of range and er he he spent weeks looking for it! Couldn't find! Because th the the sort of corn and barley would, was er was almost ready for Bloody! er harvesting, and he was frightened that he was getting a bit panicky cos if, you know, frightened a combine had had run over it. So But he went and hired and plane from Richmond Airport Oh God! Must of And th cost him a fortune! this guy flew him round and he saw it! He spotted it from there and he wen , went and got it. Probably cost him twice the amount! To hire a plane than the thing's worth! Well yeah! I have heard cases of erm planes being lost in in er crops chu chur churned up! Mm. Farmers aren't happy ! No I know. But there's a couple of guys in another division over there that they were quite keen on er aircraft and they spent weeks building these bloody things and then er, and experienced flyer he'd taken over to the other, other side of the estate when he had a bit of runway over there Aha. and fly them, and they usually flew for about ten seconds and he smashed it! And they came back for another fortnight of re-building ! He said I saw too much! Where's that bloody kettle? Two weeks after he'd said Haven't we ten second flight! Hasn't Yunny put the kettle on yet? He's just gone. He's just gone What a to get it. what a lazy bastard! I'll bloody steal his notes Yeah, when I first I used to fly, actually screen flying. Mm. Tremendous you know! I had this plane a a low four nine engine and I was only a kid. I bought it in village in Mark's Wood I used to take it up the runway and Yeah. took off and I was circle ground, it was quite a windy day then this stood there with me , had no control over the thing, like! And it er I think I think the engine cut at about Well Norm is stepping outside. Is he? Oh! Is he? Yeah. Ooh, my God ! I'm a man myself, ha? But er, is he though? Erm yeah er e , I couldn't hit, you know, just went outside and er what was this? Er, I went out the next day to go to er th yeah that was a Sunday I lost it. And before I went to school on the Monday, drove back down the marsh and went in this forest trying to find it. And we went round this estate can't remember where it was and erm thought knock on the doors and se , ask people had seen it and then later in the day this woman phoned up and said she saw a couple of kids walk down the road with it and sort of ca , called them over and said oh I heard that his, his . So I got it back. That was lucky! And it wasn't broken! I was Yeah? absolutely flabbergasted! That was a bit lucky! Could of been a gonner there! Could of been indeed. Drink? Well drop one, they're still looking. They're still looking. No, I I got plenty of time, I'm not in a hurry. Cos I I got plenty of time. Still looking. Is there still the news about carrying here? Oh I could do. I I I I think that's one of the options that I could sort of er I could still be the li , cleaner over here. If I ain't got a job by June I could still be here cleaning. You gotta take a pay cut then? Oh yeah well er well wo I'd take a pay cut because erm well I'd have to take a pay cut anyway, but the thing is though, with my pension with my pension from day one I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway. If I can take home a hundred and twenty quid well with my seventy pound a week pension two hundred quid. So I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway. I mean, sort of er you know Well, it sounds alright. Probably make a bit more hours, and course there might be er a a couple of hours a night, it'll probably be I reckon it'll probably from five to about er seven. The proper hours. And thing I suppose. Well the thing is, I don't think they're gonna put stran , they're not gonna put a stranger over here. Who don't know the job. Well, it's a bit risky for security as well isn't it? Well yeah! They're not gonna put, they're not gonna put a stranger over here are they? Really? I mean they're gonna you know? I mean, if I sort of just stay for a, for a while but er I've still keep looking for work looking for a job cos I do wanna get away from B T. The sooner I get away the better! But I'm not in a hurry at the moment. So I can't go anywhere anyway. I wanna erm hopefully er hopefully I can get myself a car once I get the money. Buy one. Weren't gonna splash it all out you know? All at once? No I wouldn't splash it all out but I'd get quite a bit cos of the twenty years. I've still got my, er get a car for about a couple of grand. Get a second hand car for a couple of grand and er I'll still have a little bit. We might pay some of the mortgage off and er er, if there's any you know, we sort of keep some in there. Keep some in the Yeah. building society. At least, at least if I had another job you see and er well I'm taking home two hundred odd two hundred pound a week. Well I worked out a hundred and twenty here and seventy pound pension. I wouldn't need to touch that money. That'd still be erm that'd still be in the er still be in the building society could be making me money. Yeah. I mean er You get some er the old interest There's the can't you? Well especially if you put it in your high interest. Yeah. Which once I've wo , which I will. The trouble is with high interest account you can't get the money out very quickly can you? Ah? You can't get the money out very quickly. Just give them plenty of notice like er a month's notice to get the money out. Oh well, yeah. That er So if you need it in a hurry it can be a problem. Yeah. Well we could have it in a ordinary account it's sa , still sort of er . You know? Just report or not. I might be able to some in er, in the ordinary account and some in the high interest account. Yeah. You could do that can't you? Oh yeah, split it up as you like! Oh! Oh yeah, but er but I'm not in a hurry anyway. I've got plenty of time. John! Right. Your tea cup got . How dare you ! Phone! Okay, boy Oy, slaphead! Me? Yeah, the chap from Arkworth Generation for you. Excellent! I'm not sure this machine the actual driver board can I know. Yeah. Because I've been trying to swop between that one and that one. In that we see the one coloured drive right? Yeah. We can re resist the and run from to that copy. When Bedge got it in I say look le I I wanna swop it see what happen. And I took, he swop it he he wouldn't three sixty two. No. I'm not sure, is it the driver that's the problem or not? So you may have to ask Norman if it'll now work. I think we will blame the or th all got in, got in. We will have some money left behind not a lot. Cos the machines in my old office all of them, all the five and a quarters agree both types. And the three and a halfs agreed with seven twenties. Yeah. Yeah! I mean this one can I mean what is what's the point in a, in a drive that'll rig one point two but not three sixty? Useless! And erm the one I got, in there can rig well three sixty K and one point two meg, no problem! As soon as I charge straight into here, what happen with it? I think it's something to with the, with the actual er driver board. Yeah. And you get all set one wha erm setting. You gonna have, you can't have a few. So we may have a, quite another a board or what? I don't know. They will let you know. They'll have to! If I could get my . Then I could have that machine and Justy can have mine. One. What I'm trying to say is that yo ,i now you gotta order another to , forty six. How do I know what's having ? Who's getting the other one then? I dunno. Mm. I have a lot of feeling right? That's it's . When these boys has come along and Colin would he look at John and what do boys say? Well he can't have yours cos he's not doing compiling that No. needs fast processing time. Tony is the one who will definitely jump up and fucking , but I tell him to fuck off! But Colin I mean Frank said to you you can have Yeah. cos you need it for your work! Yeah, but Frank did tell me to keep it, keep quiet! Don't make any don't make war! I don't know it, so I keep quiet. Don't make Yeah but as soon as he walks in here he'll go, ah new machine! Yeah. How's that then? Well you'll have to convince that it's, it's just a three eight six. Cor God! That amazes me why people, it's like a status symbol they have to have the best bloody machine! Well there's no point! But, I have Bedgey look to be honest right he do more compiling than me. If he want the forty six , I mean the forty six I give you this. And he, and he say ah no, but it's alright I got my . But, he said if if Franky order another one he say, I shall have a forty six. Be , originally they order two forty sixes one for Colin and one for Andy. Mm. But when the money tight and they, they can't get the bloody thing! Yeah, well you haven't got it yet anyway have you so Well, I will, I will get it and all the will come in here and we'll hide it or whereby no no, no one will fucking see it! And go, I set it up all working and there's fuck oh ho! It is isn't it? Oh what a pity! Can you stick in that box? But the thing is, they look so different. Don't they? And like Ian's four eight sixes, it's so different to one of those it's not like you can get away with it. Completely different, re-designed box and everything. You still using that monitor? No. Wo , have a look at this monitor? Ay? Come here, it's your monitor, everything. So I can have that monitor with that machine, ha? Yeah, you, you can get everything. Oh right. But we asked erm Colin,di did he want a monitor? And he say no! Mm. Th , the super V G A is better than the, just the V G A. They can give you twe , two hundred two hundred and er, fifty six colour. So Is this V G A or E G A? That's a Philips, a V G A. Is it? It's a normal, it's like your one, it's normal V G A. Oh! Sixteen colour. If you open tha ,ma my window, the picture is compared with the wha you put in there . Oh yeah. So I don't know what is going on! So I'm not over exciting . A Bloody politics place ! Well you got a valid reason for having a fast machine. Right! I better get the out then. And my bloody ! Ow! Well, and I put an order in to buying erm two more of these five and a quarter inch. It'll rebo Mm? That will,wi tha tha will rebo soft. Yeah, but I think th , probably the thing with number Then the driver innit? Well if it can't, it can't. Yeah well there's a problem with that because they might be on different project number mighten they? Yeah but doesn't matter! In this group, doesn't matter. In other group, maybe. Mm. In this group ,. So if you want a se see er er a normal reception you want some some level if you want what? One. If you wanna thick one want a monitor this way,, but not a lot. So you don't wanna put all that in. But it does or some order. But whereas anyone order from this company say well what do you want? Do you want a big one or a small one? If you want a huge order oh you can look for your own. When Len sent them a five pound order, or ten pound Mm. you can leave that . Th there is a if there is work in our group, no problem! As soon as we've been , all been We'll have to write that one with a indelible pen. Yes. You only get on go at it as well. So that is I dunno, you get it off with spirit I suppose. Maybe, I think you can get erm erm in, what they done on Norman's they're using a tape. A tape? Oh that's messy! Er well if you're gonna draw the line I mean I mean it's bloody we know what who's in, who's out. Yeah. Yeah, have a chat with Norman. Okay. The only problem is, I dunno if there's a mistake on this but this modem box right? Is one six one and this is it's ha! You're hoping! Yeah. It's not going into anything is it? No, it isn't, it's not got a socket or anything right? It'll have Norm! Yeah. it'll have four How do you change Look likes the actual box is one six one, this is one sixty right? Yeah. Cos I put erm So that's gonna be a bit small, but a dimension in there. we're not gonna have these connectors on so we all can do whatever size we want really can't we? Yeah. Talk to me! Cli ,wha what's the depth? The depth is erm six four one. four one. So how big's that? That will take us is it clear up Oh right! to there, to here. Erm Yeah, okay. Well what we can do No, what we'll do first ride is put in a connector, you know those connectors? Yeah. That these fellers are on? Yeah. You can get them with long pins each si have them standing up the board and then you have another board, a board with a so you can That's what I was saying! cut the pillars those there. Perhaps, yeah we might find that by the time we got to might not be able to get it all on. Cos that is like a sixth of the area isn't it? What we'll do alright? Mhm. I reckon . If we erm I'll get a if I got time today. Alright? Yeah, so basically Then, yeah, we'll just try and get through today. Start , see what the actually gonna do. Yeah, like , yeah? I mean all the chips will fit, but you gotta . Am I that boring Frank? I didn't Yeah ! say anything you know! No, not half! I didn't. But I di , I didn't realise that I thought you were actually. How old did you think I am? What an insult! Erm He's not that old are you? No, no . I suppose about be erm fifty nine. No, no no no, I'm . Erm, so you had to have didn't you? Erm, I , yes. Yeah,yo , we well we won't do that . Erm, I probably do all that but I don't . How are you? Fine, thank you. I've got a Find your headache, but Surviving? I feel a lot better. Oh well. I went for a walk out this morning but I just couldn't stand it. No. it's no good I'm gonna have to go out for a breath of fresh air. I'm better going do you? But I've got to be honest with you you know. No So he says I'm going out I said oh I feel I'm going out for half an hour that's all. Yeah I can't see the pleasure you know. So you seem a lot better Got a lot of washing to do lie down Yeah he'd like that. Yeah, he'd like that. I know but I thought So I've bit busy with other things anyway. I thought what I'd do was I'd have a bath, I thought I'd put all the back in the fridge Yeah. and I've gotta put that erm on tonight as well. Yeah. So that might be as well. Yeah. See I don't feel as I did last night but it's still there, you know I just take some more tablets like, you know. Yeah. But er Nearly getting rid of it but I've really cracked it and it's bloody awful! It does No oh aye, it does. Really cold, really, it's horrible! We didn't do him any good at all. Telling me he got six points for a driving convic for er speeding conviction Halfords I should think Oh right! When he got erm Oh Smell it. See if it smells alright Got any Oh We have to that's why Aye Mm Too much I got your er table things. They do them in packs of fifty but in Oh a split pack I got sixty. That should be enough, shouldn't it? Oh Or did I get seventy? I think I got seventy just to be sure. I thought sixty Oh alright. That's alright. was enough so I got seventy Oh right. cos there's only fifty Yeah. So I got seventy. As I said, they do, they must do them themselves and sell Oh right. They've got a well in that shop. Oh have they? Yeah. It's all bricked up. What else you've been doing? Oh I've done a bit of drawing. you wanna get your hair cut while you're there Yeah. Yeah, I ought to go and get changed Yeah, well don't stand about Yeah, that's alight. I'll get Oh yes. changed. I'll just leave them ticking over then? Yeah. I won't be long. Yeah, okay. Just go and get myself changed. Yeah, I mean you see works' vans all over the place regular. Yeah. Naughty boys! I never thought about that. ha oh. Not if they keep his licence. No. Speeding. Dangerous driving. Dangerous driving cos he made the old woman give over and overtook somewhere totally stupid and probably find he had no brake. He was slowing down anyway! What are we gonna do? It's spitting and spotting innit? Yeah. Fancy having another cup of tea? Yeah. That's if you look at it, like, you only get two chances at speeding now. Mm. Which is harder than it used to be. Must've been four then wasn't it? Yeah. Three points Like you get four gos. Yeah, that'd be right. Get one more go than you used to now you get one left. Tightened up on that, haven't they? Mm. Don't half your er insurance now, don't it? You get Yep. a speeding doesn't, never did anyway, bother them. No. Not unless you had a dangerous driving or something with it. But er losing your licence always has bothered them, hadn't it? Mm. That's always cost you. is there? A very old Granada Mm. way back Aye. Ah, yes it is Yeah. Yeah. Probably buy Hundred quid. Hundred quid Yeah. Aye. And he had a dangerous driving or a speeding I think it is Mm. horrendous insurance bill He says I can't afford scrap. Cost him more. Cost him about six or seven hundred quid a post fit in the Family Health Services Authority? Two, how does it fit in with the Joint Planning Officer who's also ready in post?, Three, how will it fit in with all the locality planning and all the work that's already been done in joint planning between the voluntary sector and the local authority and the health authority. Thank you very much, Liz. We'll keep you going all afternoon at this rate, won't we Ian. I've seen Anne and Nonnie and I don't particularly want to see anybody else. I'm glad Liz is confused because as one of her predecessors I'm also confused. I mean, you know, we've lived with this planning. There's always been planning with the people on planning, and it seems to me that the paragraph that begins ‘A key area’, we've got some more planning. And I think really what's needed is actually going out, I mean, it could be a useful new thing that, a new departure that other people haven't done. In other words not sitting there and asking people to, erm people in authority, erm sort of people of influence, ask them what they think, but actually going out and visiting people and groups, and I was going to ask whether this would be copied to the women's sub-committee, because there are many, many groups of women who never have a chance of saying what they really want, and I don't mean patients, I mean potential users of the health service. erm The Health Service has been very much male-orientated. I'm very glad to see that there's quite a lot of nurses here, and I presume that quite a lot of those are women nurses, and I think that this is terribly important, and I think a useful thing with this new service could do is to go out and talk for instance to the meetings of women's organisations, to old peoples' clubs in the afternoon, and actually ask people what they would like, and get them talking in a nice informal way, rather than waiting for somebody to let them know what they think, because I don't think they're going to get it. So, I think that would be a useful thing for a new planning section to do. erm My ears pricked up when Mr Waterhouse did in fact say, I though he said that it wasn't necessarily help in monetary terms, but some of these people might be willing to help in kind, or in sort of helping as people with some voluntary organisations, and I think, if that was what he meant, I think there again that might be very useful, because voluntary organisations are always looking for people to help. So those are my few comments, thank you. Thank you Anne. Nonnie? As someone who has to ask occasionally for a care package for an individual, do I take it then the penultimate paragraph that this is the planning, you know, how you're going to produce a care package for an individual, this is what you refer to in the planning system, and that you're getting together with Social Services to get this care package together? Yes, Okay? Would you like to tackle that lot in the best way you can? Thank you, yes, erm to take the final point in terms of care packages, yes, are officers are working on, Social Services officers, on the professional care assistant care packages. Yes, but at what level? Do you yet know at what level that's going to be organised? I don't know. You don't know, so that's part of the planning system that we're working on? The working groups are currently on working on that, and they, my colleagues I assume are talking to the the officers of the Social Services about that, what is happening, but the final outcome has yet to appear. Just answering the first question on assessment of the over seventy-fives, that in fact really should be better left for the to say. I'm not part of the organisation. They have a responsibility for managing the U G B Contract, and you quite rightly said that one of the arguments on that contract, assessments of the over seventy-fives. I belong to the Community Oxford Health Authority not to the Family Health Services Authority, so that's just to clarify that, that did cover two questions that I was asked. In terms of Primary Health Care teams, they are existing members of staff, or health visitors attached to General Practices, and we call that collaboration if you like . In terms of a planning process Anne was talking about, you'll have to forgive me for being relatively new to Oxfordshire and coming from an area where we had a planning system which was largely the one I was describing, and the planning role that I saw I wanted to develop was very much already mentioned which was actually going round to small groups of people, to the local caring groups on a much more informal basis, and getting their contribution about that and then feeding it back into the system, which you say is there in a sense. I don't think it's rooted firmly enough in the localities. And it's that part of the jigsaw that I want to concentrate on. So if there's anything, there's a slightly different approach to it, and one thing that we are being urged to do, through the very way in which you mentioned in another context, is to make sure that facilities are appropriate locally, and developing policies within that. I don't make any apologies for that, and maybe it is going over the old ground, but unless we do it, unless we try to do it, if we've done it the way before been and it hasn't produced what we, what we want, then surely it's not for us to sit back and say, ‘Well, it's been through that and it hasn't worked’, surely we ought to try again, and that's what I hope to be doing, sort of value your support and see you . Yes, can I say to you that what you're hearing is members' experiences of the past. mhm I'm not sure that you'll be able to uncover dinosaurs as it were. Well, no, but I But of course in terms of partnership, you will have our support and any way we can aid and abet you then we shall do that, erm but you can tell from the questions and comments that we have some distress about the Yes, I get that, yes Ian, thanks ever so much, it's not necessarily been an easy ride for you, but we're glad to know you and we look forward to meeting you again. Yes, well, I hope so, we can sort of work it out. I'm sure of it. Thank you very much indeed. Bye Thanks, bye bye. You can stay of course! Don't blame you! Can I just draw your attention to your item on Urgent Business. Do you all have sight of that? It's headed up ‘Appointments and Authorization of officers’ and you're asked to authorize Stephen Stansfield, a non-professional health technician, as detailed in para. 2, it's a very normal and routine bit of work for you. Are you agreed? Agreed. So that we can get on with this work. Thank you very much indeed. On to item six and seven. You'll remember we do this on an annual basis. It's very efficiently organised for us to do. We've got Keith Dryer here, I think, of the engineers. Keith, would you like to press your button and introduce us to item six, street collections in Oxford. Thanks, Chair. Basically, the latest, and I mustn't take any credit, and there seemed to be some credit, Chair. This lady on my right, Katherine Powell, does all the hard work and committee reports, and I thought it only fair to bring her here today, because she's the person that does the set fifty-threes, She does? She's one of the members you can come to. So Katherine can answer the details on the report. Right. Welcome, Katherine. I didn't realize that's who you are. I'm the one who'll always be late getting a reply back on the set fifty threes! So Katherine, do you want to say anything on the report at this stage? I'd just like to point out that erm on the street collections as you've always done before, AvaRag and NovaSports don't generally get passed, because they don't actually help anybody in Oxford. Right That's the only thing I'd like to bring to your attention. So, you can confirm for us that NovaSports are still in that position, and I think some of us understand the nature of Avarag. Yes, erm they've got a sports centre in Nottingham, and that's the nearest thing they've got to Oxford. Thank you for saying that to us, yes, I wouldn't have actually picked it up. Chair, can I just ask, I mean, so it's organisations that are Oxfordshire rather than Oxford City. Yes. That's tended to be our line. They've not been tested solely on that, but it's on the question. Well, unless people have specific to Katherine, as I say it's presented in such a way, this report, that essentially we're asked to agree the number of permits to match the number of applications. I would suggest to the committee on page sixteen on our recommendations that we do make the point about Avarag and NovaSports, just in terms of consistency, and I would expect you to want to continue to do that. So does that mean we still grant twenty-three Saturday city centre permits? That doesn't alter that position, Katherine? No, Well, it will go down to twenty-one. Quite. Could I ask on page seventeen about Blue Cross? We have got erm some organisations, the ones I can think of is the Animal Sanctuary that we are all familiar with. erm I, does Blue Cross have any connection with Oxfordshire? Yes, they've got a farm in Burford. Ahh. Can I ask that you agree on eight one A to grant them twenty-one Saturday city centre permits, and you're clear that you've left out NovaSports and AvaRag, and you understand why? Graham? I have a great deal of sympathy with all these organisations anyway, and the tremendous number of volunteers that come out on the days. I'm just wondering whether in fact every Saturday that you've got, bearing in mind this is not flag days, this is in the street. Yes, these are street collections. That we really are putting a tremendous number of people on the street over the course of the year, erm that the general public are facing. And while I think we ought to do what we can, I think there's a line which ought to be drawn, and I do honestly wonder whether twenty-one, it was eighteen last year, and I just wonder if perhaps we should erm try and switch some of these to mid-week, so that we're not seeing it virtually every Saturday of the year. Okay, Betty? I just wanted to say to you, firstly I declare an interest in OxRad, not pecuniary, of course, with money, however, but it is on behalf of charities, it is the only way they can generally raise some two three hundred pounds in a day, or sometimes a little more, that is a tremendous help to charities. And I think that erm twenty-one is nothing like too many, in fact that's not even half a year. It doesn't mean that in fact that erm that there are twenty, my maths are right, that does mean that there are thirty one Thirty-one. Where there is not a collection, I think that's perfectly reasonable. Well, of course, there's flag days as well . Yes, well then we're also making provision for disaster funds coming up, emergency funds. Can I say that we are now organising quite tightly the business of street collections, and I think if committee are minded to reduce the number of collections that we allow, we should decide that before we come to this meeting, because I think it's very difficult in practical terms to do it at this stage, and therefore I would suggest that we do agree twenty-one, not withstanding what Graham said, we can take on board some of what he said, and maybe the month before we are asked to take this decision, we have an item on the agenda where we discuss the principle before we get down to the practicalities. Would that suit you for the time being, Graham? I think so, It made me feel that some actually seem to be quite keen to have suburban or mid-week, even though they've had city centre ones in the past. Some clearly want to switch to city centre. But I did think that it might just ease the pressure on Saturdays, because, following what erm Betty has said, in fact, as I make it it's forty-five Saturdays out of fifty-two, and bearing in mind Bank Holiday weekend, Christmas and that sort of thing, it's virtually every Saturday in the city centre there is a collection. Now that's fine, but I know some people who are in the city centre every, on Saturday, feel very guilty if they're not constantly giving, and I do think we want to get that balance. Clearly we want to support the charities, and the organisations but erm. I was just going to make a quick comment if I may on Oxfam, because I noticed that they're down for the street collections and for the flag day, now next year's their fiftieth anniversary, so I think it's quite appropriate next year, but I do, my own view is, that we will get, we ought to get one comprehensive list of all these organisations, for both the street collections and the flag days, with an indication in the column of whether it's flag day they've gone for or a street collection, so that we can identify that sort of situation. Right, I mean, that seems quite sensible actually. I would just like to point out that suburban and mid-week flag day erm street collections alternate with the city centre the following year. That was committee decision a number of years ago. Right, Anne. I think there does come a point when there is resistance. I mean, we all know that having to shake tins, the number of people who go past by on the other side, and I think that we do have to be careful with the numbers, and even those people who normally give do get a bit fed up if there are too many. So what I thought was that it was quite important to look at all these organisations that do seem to me really to have nothing to do with Oxford or Oxfordshire, and that we should be very careful. Now, if we are going to, for instance, allow I mean there's one organisation, number five, which says it's a national, although it's called Cherwell Round Table, which says it's just a national body raising funds for numerous charities. Now, if we're going to allow an organisation like that, have we no erm chance to say that after they've had their collection, we should like to have some indication of what percentage went to Oxford, so that when they apply again, we can at least know whether this is actually a genuine local organisation or national. And a lot of these organisations, it's very difficult, because there are many that a lot of people are in favour of, like, well, take King George's Fund for Sailors and so on , but how do we know, I mean, there might be two people they might help in Oxford over the course of the year. I do think it's a difficult one, but I do feel there is a limit to the number, and therefore we should be careful that the ones we agree to are the ones that interest local people. Right. I think we certainly agree with you in terms of locality, and it's open to you at any time, I would have thought, to be in touch with Katherine, and say, ‘Would you follow up on x or y’. I think if the committee did that then we'd be back to what five or six years ago, when a whole afternoon was spent on that and I wouldn't commend that to you, but can we perhaps have a word with the officers at a later stage, take it on board what both Graham and Anne have been saying, and obviously not trying to do that in a meeting like this but try to prepare for it a month before-hand. Is that reasonable at this stage? Yes so we can get progress? Chair, could I make, could I suggest maybe that in future when you ask organisations you make it harder for getting a license for street collection, that you tell them that you'll want to know exactly the proportions, but I mean put it back on to them, rather than be you having to bother to it in the future. Right, is that not done? It is to a degree, on the application form that each charity receives, it has to state whether it collects for people in the Oxford area, but not as a percentage. I think that, more, not sort of say a general question like that, but say that after the collection has happened that you want returns for the number of people in Oxford that have benefited from the number of groups in Oxford that have benefited. I mean, I think a lot of national organisations that are giving, I trust that are giving money to people actually do want to know that sort of detail about where the money is going, because, if I go through this, I mean, I would have to say that I should imagine that a very small percentage of the money that has been collected on these flag days will actually get back into Oxfordshire. I mean, my knowledge of the organisations that are there tells me that. I mean there's organisations like Oxrad that clearly, the money will only be spent in Oxford city. And the bit about it is that there may well be other small organisations that might, erm be better, erm I mean, have, might benefit people more in Oxford city, or in Oxfordshire, aren't getting in because No, that's not the case, it's open to them to apply in any event. I know, but what I mean is that when they see the city centre, the people who are walking up and down the city centre, they see all the national charities, they don't necessarily feel that they're organised in the same way and therefore that they should be participating, and the whole palaver of getting a licence and applying is actually quite difficult, it's not a simple, it's not something, we get numerous telephone calls in the office saying ‘Well can I go out next Saturday and rattle a tin for such-and-such’, and you say ‘Well, you can't’, and it's left much too late, so that people don't know about the way you get licenses to rattle tins in city centre. Don't know about the issues to do with house-to-house collection. Are we getting, erm collecting erm in the shopping centres. They just don't actually have that information, a lot of small local groups, and I think maybe the C B S could work with the Engineers department in future years and try to get to those groups, because I'm sure a lot of them, actually if they were given the opportunity in time to get in, that, that you might have a lot of people applying for flag and whatever than you do now. Well, by all means, let's do that, and has been represented in committee for some time, we have responsibility for licenses for some time, and if there isn't a dialogue now, then there'll be a good reason why there isn't, and I, I take what you say, Liz. But certainly, if we have something like fifty applications, then we'd be into a much more complex procedure. We can see why we don't, and I'm not clear about the reasons why we don't, but there you are, Michael. Chair, another query about a couple of the comments made just now, about priority being given to organisations which disclaim their proceeds in Oxford or Oxfordshire. I had a cheque for some thirteen hundred pounds raised by the local branch of National body, a body like Round Table, although it wasn't Round Table, it was another body like that, and that will buy thirteen houses in Everland in Southern India. Well, not a single penny will be spent in Oxford or Oxfordshire. Now, am I to take it that sort of appeal will have a very low priority, I mean, how about Oxfam for example? Oxfam doesn't have a low priority, clearly, erm there are, certainly we have an S.O fifty-three procedure for disasters and so forth. But there isn't a direct slot, Michael, you're right, for a project such as the one you've just described. I mean, maybe what I'm hearing from the committee is that we take it back and look at the criteria and the ground rules. I just would suggest that we don't do it in this committee. But what we certainly can do is take note of what you've said, and ensure that we get it together for you to be consulted before we take decisions next year. Graham, you've had two bites, and I really I was only going to agree with you actually, and I was just going to back-up what Michael said, and say that obviously we've got people like Amnesty International, and I know it's a very hard-working local branch, but obviously, the money it's raised is going to benefit people overseas. Hopefully so, hopefully we haven't got people within the city of Oxford that need Amnesty's help! Right, can I leave you then to the recommendations on page sixteen, notwithstanding all of the suggestions and comments that have been made, that we this year grant twenty-one Saturday City Centre permits, and the officers are clear twenty-one and not twenty-three, that we grant eleven City Centre, mid-week and suburban permits, and do you note that whoever is unsuccessful in obtaining Saturday City Centre permit will be granted one of those and given priority. Yes? Will you agree to grant three band collection permits, which you've done before, which are usually great fun, I must say. And D is part of what Michael is saying, it gives the chair, vice-chair, opposition liaison member the discretion to allow for usually natural disasters, and we would obviously want that discretion with your support. There's one final thing, and that is on page fifteen at the bottom, it's a list of organisations which were given permits for St Michael the Northgate. And I'm not quite sure why Age Concern, which has had this for I think at least twenty years for their Christmas Carols, which is not included. But I don't, the fact that they're not included does not mean that they can't have it, because that would be disastrous, because they do rely on that It doesn't, they just haven't requested it this year. Well, I mean, that is absolutely nonsense, it's tradition, I'm sure they'll have it. Can you take that up with Age Concern, Anne? There's a limit as to how much we can do for half the people in this committee are members But you see it's inaccurate anyway, because it's five two during nineteen ninety five, and they had it This year They did for last year. I mean, it's for Christmas this year that we want it. Well, can you get them together with Katherine fairly rapidly, is that a good idea? I mean, there's enabling and enabling, isn't there for heaven's sake. Chair, on the recommendations erm on item D, I'm a bit unhappy about the use of the term ‘natural’ disasters, because I believe that many of the disasters that people in Oxford are actually giving money for are man made disasters, particularly matters of international economics and the unfair burden, erm unfair distribution of wealth which places a whole sector of the world in poverty, and I think, you know, you do get a magnificent response from people in Oxford to these charities, and we must be aware that there are a whole number of greater issues involved, and while I hear what you're saying earlier on about you can't take on the problems of the whole world, I think when people are actually giving money to charities for example, like Oxfam, they are often unaware of these issues, and we do have a wider role in making the, joining with organisations like Oxfam in spreading public awareness on these issues. Right, I agree with that, and I think that we'll simply leave out the word ‘natural’ in future, won't we. Have we agreed that as a committee? Indeed, we have all agreed, I take it the recommendations under eight one in order that we can make progress. Which left the word in? So that we can report back, a month before decision time next time round? Are you happy with that? Item seven then is on page twenty-seven. This is flag day, which essentially means house-to-house. Is there anything you want to say about that, Katherine at this stage? No, it's quite straightforward. Right, the only comment I have is members will remember that we got slapped in council last year because we issued a permit to LIFE for a flag day application. I sat down with LIFE and worked through their philosophy, erm in line with our own as it were, and they agreed, and I would ask them to agree this year that any paperwork or any leaflets they distribute make it very clear that a choice remains for a woman in terms of whether or not she should have an abortion, because LIFE is fairly, yes, Michael? Did you check their tenancy agreement, because it was a pretty Machiavellian, Dickensian tenancy agreement, if you're found smoking in bed for example, you were out the next morning, those sort of things, and I think you really ought to look at that very carefully. We certainly did last year, there's no reason why we can't monitor it again, so they know we are watching them quite carefully. That might have been for very good environmental and health reasons. Yes, I should hope so. I think I would commend LIFE to you, but it will be with the same conditions and terms as we did last year, with which they did comply. Are there other questions of queries on flag days or are you happy to approve them as they stand. That's on page twenty-seven, six one, twenty four flag day permits to be approved, and we allow the officer to decide how they will best be distributed across the city. Are you happy with that? And then on six two, do you wish to grant a permit to allow a flag day to take place on one or two days during nineteen ninety-one, for the Royal British Legion? Can I have someone move something on that, please? Yes, I'd move that erm they'd be granted two days. I'll second that. And you'll second that, cross-party approach to this, are you all agreed? Thank you very much indeed. Can I ask, I know we've got Amanda Root here, who's going to help us in the Health Action Area Report, I also know that she has an ailing child, can we then take the item eleven, health action areas now on page fifty-eight, so that we can let Amanda go back to her commitments. The joint report from Amanda and Phil. Amanda, do you want to kick off on this? Thank you chair, erm many of you will perhaps know that the health authority did some pioneering work looking at different standard mortality ratios in different wards in Oxfordshire, and came up with some rather disturbing evidence that some of the wards had significantly higher incidents of death for people primarily in the forty-five to sixty-four age range than others, and Phil and myself wish to continue that work by targeting those wards with a range of measures designed to alleviate some of those health inequalities. And in this report, we've just outlined a very preliminary start to what we're doing. We'd obviously, we'd like to get the agreement of this committee to continue that work and to take it up to the various bodies and consultation. And, erm to develop it there's a timetable in the appendices about the progress we envisage making. We'd like to confirm by the end of this year which wards we're targeting and how we're targeting them, which range of erm measures that we're going to undertake. is that we've been involved in health strategy for the past over five years. The ultimate test of any health in the city strategy is what we do about the health divide. We have to do something about the equity target. And that's extremely difficult to do something about the equity target, since National policy, the distribution of income, housing policy, all the things that we tackle on this committee and committees of the council have a very significant effect on the health of the people who live in the city, and it's not in our control. Nevertheless, it's our belief that through health promotion programmes which involve cooperation with communities themselves, that we can in fact do as much as we possibly can do to actually alleviate some of the erm differences in health status. So our belief is that erm with the relationship we've been able to build up in this city, with confrontation and community participation, with the targeting of the small resources that we do have, as a council in collaboration with the other, the resources of the other bodies, that we can in fact do something. So I'll do this and I think Amanda would agree with this that this is the ultimate test that will help us in establishing can we actually do something about target one of the World Health Organisation, which is to narrow the health divide. That's out test. I would also add to that that I think such work would help us in terms of targeting more effectively the existing resources we have in terms of service delivery. Are there any questions? Sheila? Chair, I'd like to ask Amanda, I did St Clements and Petersfield . Is there any possibility of, in the near future of doing a council estate, like Barton or Blackbird Leys? erm Yes, certainly, I, I would suggest East and St Clements because they have got quite high ethnic populations, and we can perhaps be hoping to start there, because Environmental Health's already worked there, targeting some of the multi-occupation properties, so they've got a very high proportion of black people living there, which means that they're also quite important in the sense of deprivation, but, I mean, we are also very conscious that we should be working on a council estate, and what we, what I would like to do is to simultaneously be starting working in erm a particular sets of communities, is to be given work in consultation in other wards, so that you know, six months down the line before . But thanks for the point, and I mean, I'll make a note of that and take it up to the health authority. Betty and then Ruth. I'm a little surprised, chair, I could ask Amanda, but erm, Iffley is erm on the list, bearing in mind, recalling the erm point figures, where Iffley are if I recall correct was fairly well down on the league table, and Marston was something like erm six or some place. erm What connection is there between unemployment and deprivation? Thank you. erm I agree, and I actually think these figures are relatively crude, but I mean, there is, clearly there are correlations between low income, which most I mean unemployed people have of course got, and ill health. But certainly, something like Iffley's relatively surprising, it could well be, it might be because there's quite a high proportion of retired people or something, so the figures are actually distorted. erm What, what we're hoping is that erm the university's undertaking some research to actually look at the links between very small geographic areas, postcode in fact, and ill health. So when that research becomes available, we'll actually be able to be much, much more specific about where we're targeting, because I agree it's, you know, some of these are somewhat surprising. Nonnie Yes, in one five, erm they're practising notes from Eynsham it does happen to be in Cherwell ward and not North ward, erm there is a booklet out about health and housing in Cutteslowe, and I wondered what the connection between, you know, not being on this committee, but these health action areas, and what in fact is happening in housing, because the director did assure me that other wards were going to be treated to the same erm treatment. So I don't know whether that is what's referred to? Hang on, can I just check out your question, certainly we've taken the Cutteslowe health and housing audit to this committee, and so has housing Yes, yes, but that's not going to be the only one, as I understand it. That was an external one in fact Yes, is that's what's being referred to erm by the university work, because I think it's It isn't actually Is that so? It isn't. The other question I've got is presumably all this is still being done within what we've got in the budget, or is it, are there going to be extra bids? You know the answer to that question, Non, there's going to be no extra bids. No extra bids. This particular section's taken some slices already, so we'd better watch what we say to them. They're doing it within their own time and resources, but it does seem to me to be a very appropriate area for Michael? Thank you It's certainly will be difficult, Chair, but in answer to Mrs Tidley, what's happening to our housing, the answer is we've stopped building it. Government policy we don't build any housing, and therefore we've got five thousand on the waiting list, and that's why health is a major problem for a lot of people in this city, because we're not building any houses, she knows that, and she and her party do nothing about it. We're doing an awful lot in Thank you, Gerald. Yes, well, I particularly welcome this erm concentration on areas, I think it's an excellent idea, particularly in relation to housing, I think what we will find interesting is that a whole number of Oxford citizens, perhaps indeed from Barton, Blackbird Leys, Marston originally, who are badly housed in these areas and waiting in the most appalling accommodation for the opportunity of a council home. And I'm sure that this report on the health action area is going to show some fairly, erm give us some fairly staggering erm revelations about about the health of Oxford citizens that's going to surprise people at large when they find out how badly people have fared over the past ten years when we've had the Tories in office who've really done their very, very best to make the health divide of this country in a very poor state. Hear, hear Thank you, Anne Sorry I was going to go down to get an authorization from Age Concern, I missed the first bit, but erm if resources are allowed for this work, would it not be better to aim them at priority areas, and not wards, I mean, in other words, to put it to the areas that needed most. I mean a ward is going to be seen as rather a big area, when within wards there are priority areas. That was really my point. I don't think I'll bother to answer the remarks that others need to say of course tremendous resources have gone into the health service over the past few years, but I think whatever government is in power, it will never be enough for all the new developments in the health service, and that is always the trouble, whoever would be there would find it difficult. erm Your comment on wards, I think this is a way of the officers giving us something to work on and take a decision on. Once they have a decision to work, then I would doubt very much actually they're going to be into every corner of St Clements and East, or ignoring council estates altogether. We have to allow them to take some decisions within our decision, I think, but I'm sure they'll take your point anyway. Diana, and then we ought to come to a decision. Yes, I'm sure, I mean we obviously all appreciate the fact that within wards there's an area of deprivation and an area that isn't deprived. I mean, many, many wards, but that doesn't mean that we should therefore ignore a ward because it's got an area that is not deprived, you've got the, I think that by choosing East and St Clements as areas, that they seem then quite sensible areas to start with, nice central, fairly central location. I was going to say, when it comes to paragraph five, do you erm suggest that you actually think in terms of church organisations, they're not mentioned, and I look forward in in paragraph seven one to the seminar, the working seminar that's going to be in the near future, and I hope that we'll soon get a date, so that we can get it in our very busy diaries, in the hope that we can come along and learn more about this. Thanks very much, Diana. Could we add mosques as well to the churches, please? I'm sorry, I should have said all religious groups. All religious groups ! Can we come to a decision there please. Yes, just on the sub-ward level, of course there's really, there's a lot more investigations to go into targeting the resources, just I mean to target them in a city by having these standard mortality ratios for wards, but they're all below ward level, and target the specific areas. erm That's one point, the other point is of course, we have already targeted of course in working with the groups that we've defined as erm ones whose health status is at risk in effect, so this is a supplement, this is actually translating those targets we have already defined into a locality planning exercise. So we're testing, those priorities are still holding for us that but we're applying them to the localities. Thanks very much. Can I direct you then to page sixty-one, recommendations in paragraph eight. You're asked to support the general move, that we have set out from this report, and you're asked to agree to St Clements and East Ward, and I think we've heard Mandy and Phil acknowledge that there may well be a case for looking at an area of council housing, which we will leave them to do, and also to approve the set of objectives, which I particularly welcome, on page sixty-two and sixty-three, which will amount to a work programme, which I would have thought we were all very pleased to see. Can we endorse that, and ask the officers to come back to us and keep us in touch with their work. Are you agreed? Thanks very much indeed, thank you both, and I . We need to move somewhat quickly, and I am reminded that, I did see Caroline come in, but we have two people who've come in connection with item fifteen, Community Concerns in East Oxford, are you agreed that we take that now, so that they can I think it ties in very well with the item we've just discussed. Thank you, Graham. Item fifteen, and Shereen has just arrived as well. Caroline and your visitor, would you like to join us at the table, if you want to join in. So we're turning to page seventy-five. The paper is in fact written by Shereen. I don't want you to think, Caroline that we are acquitting you rapidly, I will try to acquit you rapidly, but I am also delivering what you've come for. Well, thank you, chair, for inviting me here. erm do you want me to speak to this Please do. Caroline Morrell, from OCADU, do you want to press your button, Caroline, so that everybody will please sit down normally and naturally, and maybe moved a bit closer to you, they'll pick up what you're saying. erm But I raised this at the alcohol forum, because erm sometime this summer I had a phone call from Mr Bailey here, who is a resident of East Oxford, to express his concern about various problems erm in East Oxford, problems that were posed to residents there. erm I think in fact it would be better to ask Mr Bailey to explain what his concerns were erm I'd just like to say first although initially it revolves around problems of drinking, I'm looking at other issues of East Oxford, in that recently there's been a great deal of concern about glue sniffing in sections there, and there have been various letters from residents in the local newspapers, and I think there's a general level of problem for people living in East Oxford, and it's not just that the people there want the streets cleaned up or whatever, they want something constructive and helpful to be done for people. So Welcome, would you like to take two or three minutes to talk to us about your concerns. Right. I should say first how this matter arose. It arose because some neighbours in my street effectively started behaving which was totally antisocial. There was a small group of young people who, as it happens were also associated with the bed-and-breakfast on Iffley Road, erm and several of them had moved between this house and the bed-and-breakfast. Their activities ranged throughout the day and night and reached a peak of basically making a noise nuisance of themselves, there were other troubles which I will mention later, in which they would be playing two or three different sound systems, and at its worst, a full drum set in the early hours of the morning, obviously keeping their near neighbours not only awake but in a state of some anxiety. I live directly opposite to them, and there were two of their neighbours who effectively unable to carry on a normal life throughout most of the time that they were there. This was taking place on five or six nights until early mornings a week for several hours. Eventually a noise abatement notice was served on them, and erm immediately after that the landlord offered them a hundred pounds to leave, and they left. He did that because they had not only annoying his neighbours, sorry, their neighbours, because he had once been one of our neighbours, but also they had damaged his house, and they had already cost him probably about two hundred pounds in repair bills until the house itself, broken doors, window erm the wall, and bit of the roof and so on, and there was every reason to believe that this would just carry on. Now, erm I think I should make clear that I have some personal feelings on this, and I just want to say something very briefly about my neighbours, something I actually don't agree with . erm There is a general concern I think with multiple occupancy that there's, a whole way of life of East Oxford is changing, and not for the better, and indeed I was part of this when I moved into the area ten years ago. erm And the, a lot of this was not specific to drug or alcohol abuse but simply to multiple occupancy. And we've now reached a situation in which there's something over twenty percent of our streets is multiple occupation, erm and this is noise and other activities in relation to that are the things that cause the sort of low level of concern, and this was just the peak on top of that of major aggravation. erm I think there are one or two of the elderly tenants in particular who felt really very anxious about activities at night time, and they're going to have their property stolen, or things thrown at their house. I mean these people, there's things like throwing broken milk bottles, throwing milk bottles into peoples yards, removing bicycles, picking up my bicycle, as it happens, and throwing it down several times, erm going down the streets playing a sound system full volume at two o'clock in the morning, which generally left people feeling they didn't know what was happening. This was only part of a general sort of pattern as it were, where people were beginning to impinge on their lives, there was another well-known local alcoholic there who was knocking on doors trying to get money off people, and there's several elderly people who gave this woman money, because they were frightened that if they didn't something would happen to them. So I think I can express some of my neighbours concerns, unless, particularly, not particularly worried about those, but there is a general feeling that things are getting worse, and that they're not safe in their own homes, among the more elderly. erm And obviously a few people don't like the sight of people on the Cowley, the Cowley Hospital site, and things like that. This doesn't concern me. I do feel I'd like to say one point about the people who were in this house, that it's quite clear, all of them I believe were under care of the social services, erm and I don't know enough about their history to say whether they, where they've been before, whether they've been in some half-way house, or just been thrown out of some mental institution. I'm virtually certain that the woman from whom we had most of the aggravation had been. She was clearly mentally disturbed, and the reason that I got in touch with the legal project was to see if there's anything that could be done by them to start giving her some way of getting in touch, getting to solve her problem. Obviously this was done out of self interest, but I really, the woman was in real pain. She was an extremely angry, very bitter woman, who was determined to get everybody around her as angry as she could, and she succeeded, and I don't know where she's moved now, but I'm sure she will go on and do the same thing, and frankly, I despair of anything being done unless there is some provision made for people such as herself, and one of her friends in particular. That's really what I'd like to say. Thank you very much indeed, I think that's fairly fair, but none-the-less honest way of setting out your feelings. This is quite a specific issue, and I'm not sure that this committee on this day is in the best position to discuss it in detail. Obviously I'll take your advice on that. I do think as far as placing people in houses in multi-occupation, we acknowledge that. How is it done, by whom, who thinks about it, is it planned, is there support, and for that reason we are arranging a meeting, Frank, together with the Health Authority with all those agencies who do place people, sometimes quite sick people as you rightly point out. So that is certainly on line. Now, I know that what Shereen asks us to do, and I'm sure Caroline as well, is to organise a multi-agency meeting. We've done this on the proposed East Oxford Education centre. I think we can very usefully do this, and iron our way to this. What we need from you is really a specific proposal about the kinds of groups and individuals that you want us to sit down with. You can either do that now, or we can agree in principle that we will take this up. Perhaps chair, vice chair, and opposition liaison member if you feel that's suitable. And call such a meeting. I think it will a long way, but you're quite to draw it to us, and to ask us to set out on that road. Michael? Yes, chair. What sort of people would you involve in this meeting. I mean there's a lot of voluntary organisations who are working in this field, I don't know how you would just make sure you got them all. The resources are pitifully small. I mean, I'm involved in doing some statistics for Windmill House, the probation service, and we've found that the sixteen-to-eighteen-year-old provision in the city is very, very small. I'm sure it's the same for many of the other groups who've got problems. But, erm I hope you involve all those sort of organisations in your discussions. I would imagine that Shereen would apply the same kind of pattern as you did to the de-toxification centre meeting, Shereen, and I felt that there were a great many people there, a great many interested, including the voluntary interest. Betty? Well, of course, chair, a lot of these problems are arising out of the so-called ‘care in community’. I was hoping we'd avoid the political discussion, Betty. Well, you know, I mean. We've a job to do here. Well, you know me, I don't normally become political, but let's face it, this is one of the direct results of throwing the money to the community without any after care, and I was particularly concerned, with my other hat on, only last week, that a young man told us his address was now the night shelter. Now, because his time at the Bridge had ended, he had nowhere else to go, except to the Nightshelter. Now, I thought that was quite inappropriate for a young man like him, who had nowhere else to go, so there are many, many multiple problems for people like this in this city, and anything we can do would be appreciated, but I really don't know where we would stop, there are so many problems. I would ask members to be brief, otherwise we shall actually lose matters off this agenda today. Liz, and then Patrick. Chair, can I suggest that some of the people who are actually involved in this are actually asked themselves rather than agencies that might be working with them, because I think that, that most of the, the sort of people we're talking about are actually very sensitive. And they know about what's happening to them, and know that at the end of the day, it doesn't matter about what their behaviour is, it doesn't matter about what happens to them, because nobody cares. And I think it's very, very important that they're involved. Through the Princes' Trust in the month we actually give grants to something like twenty people, just to get them off the street, because there was nowhere else they could turn to. And I think that there's a massive problem that needs to be addressed, and I think we should involve those people themselves, also in looking at what the issues are, it's all very well for people to decide, workers to think that they know what the issues are. I very often think that that's not the case. Yes, I think we'd all agree with that. Patrick? Thanks, erm the report refers to East Oxford, which is of course for two wards, East and St Clement's, but the problem extends city-wide, and I think the solution should be seen as a city-wide solution. Yes. Do you want to finally come back? Yes, I'd like to add one point, matters that the house continues in multiple occupancy and is successful at the present, and the landlord is not prepared to say that he is being now an agent of some hospital or other. I'm sure that he is, the people who've come from there, quite clearly recovering alcoholics or mental hospital patients, or possibly people from prison, and I've known enough people in my time to know this. And it is working very, very successful at the moment with the current set of tenants. However, there's clearly a need for some sort of monitoring and for some support erm other than erm some other support. The landlord is not prepared to come up front and say that's what he's doing. Unfortunately, I suspect because he fears a reaction from his neighbours, and I'm afraid he's right. He'd be very aware of what's likely to happen. He is trying to do something about it, though, I'm sure. Right, and this will call for some sensitivity in terms of how we handle this. Caroline and Shereen, is there anything else you want to comment on, otherwise I would ask that you'd come back to me on this in more detail. I think I'd just like to add that I think that this could possibly be a very big piece of work. Exactly. And I think it would actually need, if it's going to be taken on board, somebody appointed to look at this, or it be put in somebody's job brief and I would have thought ideally that it would be placed with the community worker, and I don't know quite how we're placed for community workers in East Oxford, but maybe it's something we could put to that department. I hear what you say, and I hesitate to make any further comment on that, given the current climate, but let's set about just examining the shape of the difficulty at the moment, and see what we can as it were immediately deal with ourselves, and what we can try and persuade other people to help us to know . Will you come back to me in terms of who you want to invite, taking on Liz Kermey's point about involving people themselves if they so wish, and we'll consult with the opposition liaison member and the vice-chair. But in principle we agree do we not, to back multi-agency meeting, given what we said in the discussion and we will come back to you with something that's maybe a bit more specific, and more easy to discuss, may I say. Thank you very much indeed for coming. Thank you. Thank you, thank you for bringing it forward. Thank you very much. We're back to the normal agenda, item eight on page thirty-six. Will you also while you're looking at this look at page thirty-seven, which is the pollution and nuclear issues control sub-committee. You will see there there has been a detailed discussion on this white paper, and members from that sub-committee made comments. I would suggest we do not need a second read of the discussion, but that can people keep an eye on , or try and change what is already there on pollution itself. Peter, you're introducing this on page thirty-six. Yes, I think it's totally clear that what we need is a short message, and it's a white paper, and therefore it's inviting a message, so what we really need is a short message to go with the A B C and the government act on the two S P's and I would give an undertaking at this point that it will go under the chief environmental health officers' name. Yes, quite. While you're thinking about it, there are three quick things that you might like to add in, one is on page seventy-four, which, erm seventy-four? I think it's seventy-nine, Peter. Yes, seventy-nine, it's the, in particular one a, I think concerns this community greatly. The document included no indication of the role of local authorities, or the resources needed by local authorities. We intend to take this recommendation for action. And if you actually look at this paper, there's quite a bit at the end of the day that the local authority will need to do, and I think we need to underline that and to get money. The second point, briefly, is that the white paper has turned its face on the establishment of an environmental protection agency, and independent environment protection agency, and erm, you may feel strongly, I know there was another report that came out just about that time that erm was advocating it, and you may feel that what is needed is a central, independent environmental protection agency. This paper only gives erm an, what is called an integrated pollution inspectorate, now unfortunately with those sort of central inspectorates is that after the public's attention has drifted on, they tend to be erm, they tend to dwindle in numbers, as we've seen with the present pollution inspectorate. Now, thirdly, is on this question of C O 2 emission. If you look at the report, White Paper, you'll notice that it's sticking to a, a freezing of the nineteen-ninety levels by the year two thousand and five, and you may feel that you would like to see this country come more into line with the other E E C countries and ask for a freezing by the year two thousand. So those are three, anyway, three things erm that you might like to think about for a short message for a response to the White Paper. Michael. And can I ask members not to repeat the discussion of the pollution sub. Just be very brief, chair, erm could I ask that we have a report before council on this, and I know it will be an extra two hours on the poor council debate, but I think this is so important, and it does affect the planet for hundreds of years to come, and I think if we can't have a discussion on this in full council, well, it's the most important thing we've had for years probably, and I think we should have a discussion before council sit. Can I ask for a list of the full report before council, so it will give us a chance to have a debate there rather than here. You can, and we will. Anne? It was just on a minute on page seventy-nine, I think we want to get the support of local M Ps, one a has I think, has been just indicated, is contradictory, it might be better to say, ‘although the document indicated that local authorities would be expected to undertake extra, an extra, or extra duties, the resources needed are, no indication was given of how there would be extra resources, or something like that, you see it's contradictory at the moment, it says there's no indication of the role, and then says that they would need resources, and actually if you look through the document, you will see from time-to-time it is indicated what local authorities are expected to do, for instance recycling of litter and the lot, and I think that that might be actually picked up by M P's and say, ‘Well, what actually have Roy , House Builders Federation. I'll try my best to to respond to most of what we've already heard this morning. Erm, the basic stance of the er er of the federation is that we erm make use of the latest information. We regard that as being consistent with government policy, as set out in P P G twelve. But it is in our view, government policy to provide for development needs. Consistent within a framework of regional guidance. We have as Mr said already this morning, we have no regional guidance. Erm and his claim that in fact the regional draft regional guidance er that has emerged is consistent with this alteration, is not really surprising since the same parties drew up the same document. . So our purpose here and I would echo er what Miss has just said, is essentially to take a view about migration. That is the essential component erm which er will determine e effectively the strategic policy which will apply to this county. It's interesting that despite all that's been said about migration and I'll come back to it, but we actually start, the county and ourselves, from the same point, more or less, within about four four dwelling I think. Erm and but it's after that that we we we differ a bit. However as far as the basic strategy is concerned of this particular alteration, it includes for the first time, conversions. And that is a fundamental change to the previous strategy. And it amounts to, in effect a twelve point five percent decrease in housing provision. At a time when household formation rates suggest we should be going in the opposite direction, simply to stand still. This is a fundamental change of strategy without doubt. I don't want to hold up this alteration, and I, like Mr , don't want to wait three years for a decision. But I would say to you that such a fundamental change of strategy, would normally have its proper place in a replacement plan, rather than an alteration. So how do some of our differences come about. We have a number of technical differences which are essentially differences about the composition of the population and its natural change. And we would say that that difference amounts to sixteen hundred dwellings. We have a base dwelling difference, although in view of your remarks, that may well pale into insignificance. But nevertheless, it is a matter of fact that there is a difference of seven hundred and fifty dwellings, in the base dwellings that we've used. We do have a difference in vacancies. Er whereas the County Council have sought to re to er keep vacancies constant, we have said that it is reasonable to seek to plan to keep second homes etcetera as a constant number but what I would term normal vacancies, can be reasonably be expected to go up to maintain the same proportion. That does I think form a significant element because it makes a difference of nearly two and a half thousand dwellings. Perhaps I could intervene and try to establish a view on vacancies, so at least we can get one element of out Mm. of the debate out of the way. And perhaps Miss and D O E may have a view to contribute too. But if I can put my thinking erm on the floor first, it seems to me that vacant Normal vacancies as Mr has described them, are a function of people moving from one house to another. And it seems to me there is no reason to suppose that because there are more houses, the propensity to move from one house to another declines. Perhaps before gentleman of the County Council whose name I still can't see comes in, Miss may wish to say something. I think in this day and age, there is probably a greater propensity to move and consequently there may well be an increased erm amount of vacancies occurring and that was why in our statement, we actually increased the number of vacancies, but I think that is a function of the number of houses on offer at the time. Mm. H how in that context, does the County Council defend its position Mr You're not Mrs , you're Mr Thank you. Mr will Yes Malcolm , County Council. I think our concern is that the vacancy rate erm in the census indicates that some seven point one percent of the the properties in the county are vacant at er at that time. We are very concerned that in in making provision for housing through to the year two thousand and six, we should not be making provision for that level of vacancy rate, which seems to us to be artificially high when compared with the the national figures. And indeed we hear from the D O E that they have a figure in their paper of something like five and a half percent. The figure that we have come up with in fact is derived by holding constant the numbers rather than the rate of vacant dwellings through to the year two thousand and six, which implies that by the year two thousand six, we'd have would have a vacancy rate of six point two percent or or thereabouts. Which is still substantially higher than the national figure, and substantially higher than the figure being proposed by the Department of the Environment for North Yorkshire. Can you split that six point two percent between the the second homes etcetera and the normal vacancies? Erm I don't have the figures off hand but I er we could provide those figures. Because it presupposes, if one a assumes that the second homes etcetera remain constant. It presupposes a reduction in the rate of normal vacancies. I I th would prefer to look at the vacant dwellings as a single entity rather than necessarily splitting them down between the the the various types. My question still remains the same then. Does it not presuppose a reduction in the rate of all vacancies? That's right, yes, from seven point one to six point two percent over the period through to two thousand and six. If you accept that that derives from the propensity to move, is it sensible to make that assumption? But that is only one of the factors in North Yorkshire that is influencing the vacancy rate. We do have a very large proportion of holiday accommodation and second homes, which are concentrated in certain parts of the county. And we're concerned that this figure of seven point one percent, is in fact artificially inflating the housing requirement through to two thousand and six. I had hoped this would be a short point. Could I ask Mhm. Our figure discounted second homes. Our figure of the vacancy assumptions is the number of vacant dwellings. Yes your rate was something like five and a half percent if I remember rightly, yes yes. Yes. No Whereas That's right yes, but it has takes no takes no account of second homes. H B F have gone for four point four five percent. Yes. But leaving the second homes as a constant figure and separate from is that right? I can't quite see the reason for discounting second homes altogether as the D O E have done. They are a factor in the the housing market in North Yorkshire and I think that we have to take those into account when we are looking at vacancy rates through to two thousand and six. And I think the overall figure that we've had produced, which is around the six point two percent, is still a very substantial level of vacant dwellings within the county. And I'm in no doubt that that will allow for the operation of a housing market, through movements er population and so forth. What can the County Council do first of all to stop people moving house and secondly, to stop people stop d to prevent any change in the number and distribution of second homes? The County Council isn't actually trying to control who occupies houses and what purpose they occupy them. What we're concerned with is the amount of land that or the amo number of dwellings that we are providing, through the structure plan, through local plans for the future. Er we're not seeking to control individual occupancy, that is not possible through the planning system. But the implication of a declining rate of vacancies, is that something will stop people moving house. No I I'm not sure it necessarily will stop people moving house, what we're talking about is a level of provision for vacancy rates which is still well above national rates. Is that including your second homes though? That is including second homes yes . Yes. But it Mr , I'd hoped it would be a short point. Obviously we're not going to reach agreement on that , but do you want to come back on vacancies. Or or indeed does Mr want to come in on vacancies? I could. Steven from . I think inadvertently, Mr has has slightly muddied the waters, by reintroducing second homes. I think that discussion is more usefully conducted in terms of what you called normal vacancies. And this is the basis on which the D O E have put in their figure, it's the basis on which we have put in a figure for vacant dwellings, and also the H B F. And all of us as it were, set aside as a block, all the second homes as holiday homes and say, those are as it were , outside this enquiry, we'll leave them there. They don't even enter into the projections we have done at all. Because they're a constant number, it doesn't arise. I think the issue as you rightly as Miss rightly put it, is the normal vacancy rate and is there any reason to suppose as the County Council must be supposing, that this shrinks to a degree. And when I say the vacancy rate, I mean a percentage rather than a number. And I don't see any mechanism whereby that production can be engineered, or indeed any intention by the County Council to engineer such a reduction. In which case I would see that the sensible thing to do, which is what we have done, is to assume that the current vacancy rate stays the same as a percentage and that with a larger dwelling stock, results in some additional vacant dwellings. I I can't say any more than that. Erm that is exactly our point of view. Sorry can I just come back to Mr 's point, where you say, that the current rate of vacancy. Are you talking about the current rate as it prevails or we're told it prevails ion North Yorkshire, or are you looking at a figure which is somewhat nearer the national average or the figure which Mr 's organization have chosen. Steven ,. We have sought to use the rate for the percentage for North Yorkshire, as at the nineteen ninety one census. I interrupted Mr . Right, er thank you very much. Roy , House Builders Federation. Erm so moving on, apart from the difference in in in vacancies, we then have erm a difference related to concealed households. Erm Mr has explained the view which is taken been taken by by North Yorkshire. Our view is that we should seek to accommodate concealed households. Concealed households are people who exist currently within the county. Whether or not further concealed households are formed over the next fifteen years, seems to me to be an irrelevance. It it should be the purpose of the planning authorities to seek to house its people. By ignoring concealed households, it is in fact not seeking to house its people, and is in fact not doing what in fact it says it should be doing within the explanatory memorandum. I suspect after the Prime Minister's speech last night, it's no longer political correct to talk about single parents. If he's back to basics, but is it realistic to suggest that there will that all concealed households will disappear? I am er it it may or may not be realistic to suggest that all concealed households will disappear. I did say that it's probable that concealed households will be formed over the fifteen year period. So they will continue to arise, but I think that it is right to plan to accommodate the ones that you know about. And the ones that we know about at the moment are the ones revealed from the census. The information from the Department of the Environment's nineteen eight nine based household projections, suggests that in fact there is a slightly larger number possibly erm in in in the round and that is five thousand dwellings as opposed to the three thousand one hundred and seventy we're seeking to include. And so to take what we would describe as a reasonable view on this, we say that if you know from evidence there are a number of concealed households, you should seek to accommodate them. And it is that is essentially the bottom line. Erm one could plan to accommodate more on the chance that they will arise, but we're not putting that forward. Erm the then the seems to us the final er difference between ourselves and the er county council, is the issue of migration and what's already been referred to as environmental discounts. I'm sure we'll come on to discuss the nature and extent of those environmental discounts later. Erm but what we would say at this stage, is that there doesn't seem any rationale behind the discounts that have been applied by by the County Council, indeed we have a situation in Hambleton district, where there is a seventy percent discount, erm which doesn't seem to us to have been explained or justified. Erm we have put forward an alternative er mechanism for environmental discounts and er I can say by at this stage, by reference to the erm critique that has taken place of that of those environmental discounts in N Y eleven, that erm, while we wouldn't go along with making anywhere near the the additions that are suggested there, erm it may be that it would be sensible to make a further discount in respect of the heritage coast. So long as that does not include Whitby and Scarborough and er any settlements to the West of the what is essentially the coast road. Erm it may be that it it is sensible to make that discount and would only ap apply to Scarborough dis district, but as for the rest of the additional elements of er environmental discount that should be applied, I can't see why you should apply a discount in relation to agricultural land. I'm not aware we've got people living physically on agricultural land at the moment, they are fields as far as I know. Er and it would be just as sensible to make a discount for industrial land on that basis. I don't see why you should make a discount in respect of greenbelts. It is a matter of fact that greenbelts simply displace people around. Indeed the York greenbelt is entirely designed to do that. Displace people from York to er according to this structure plan alteration, partly to a new settlement on the outside of the greenbelt. And indeed within the greenbelt there are a number of settlements which we are sitting in one at the moment. Er which er have housing proposals within them and er to just make an average for the discount for the whole of the relevant parish, would be to overstate that particular case. Erm so we have we have er a a a a major difference there. Erm but our summary really would be that if one followed the County Councils proposals, this county would end up with a severe housing shortage. And that will actually drive people away from North Yorkshire. It won't actually stop people coming in to North Yorkshire. We don't have passports in this country, although as a long-standing Yorkshireman, I've always thought we should have them with Lancashire, but that's another issue. Erm but we don't and in fact what will happen in a housing shortage is that in migrants will be able to buy their way in. To some extent, the government's policy of affordable housing will enable an element of affordable housing to be provided, but it won't satisfy the needs of either people who are currently on the bottom of the housing rung and seeking to move up, nor will h help people who might be seeking to afford to c to come in as first time buyers as opposed to people who are otherwise er some other arrangement through an affordable housing provider. I have circulated round this morning, three er sheets which which help demonstrate that particular point. The second sheet which is headed commitments, is a list which is derived from er the statements made by the different authorities, er about the number of dwellings which are already permitted in one form or another. Er within their area. And we can see there that there are some nearly thirty three and a half thousand dwellings already committed. And having looked at identified needs for affordable housing, within again various statements made by the local authorities and compared those with the commitments that are left, in other words the places where they they could reasonably be found, we get some fairly large percentages of affordable housing requirement le on on on the remaining land. And on the front sheet o entitled affordable housing, we see there that in the case of Hambleton we'd be looking at forty one percent, of the remaining dwellings being unaffordable being affordable houses, down to York where it goes up to ninety percent. That is on the basis of the proposals put forward by the County Council. On the other hand, if the panel were to accept the figures which we are putting forward, you can see from the s the t table at the bottom of the page, those proportions come back to down to much more reasonable amounts. And we would say that that is much more likely to be achieved. In short, we are the people who are looking after the interests of the North Yorkshire people. And providing for their needs. Similarly,I have also circulated a table entitled environmental capacity, where I have looked at what is the difference in percentage land-take terms, between the proposals of the county council and the proposals of the federation. We can see from that table that even on unconstrained land, we are talking about a difference of point one nine percent of land take. I would suggest to you that this must be an extraordinarily sens environmentally sensitive county if it cannot afford over fifteen years, to take an extra point one nine percent of its unconstrained land into development. And if by doing so it was to ensure that people who are already resident in this area are driven, this would be a totally inadequate response to the needs of the people of North Yorkshire. If we convert your nought point one nine percent into hectares we're talking about roughly five hundred, is that right? Erm If I if I take Yes yes Yes two one four O from Yes. one six four eight. Yes. That Erm Sorry. Just one final point if I may about er er about about migration. Which I'll just pick up on as a as as a final point. Erm Mr introduced the the the the the prospect that erm if they'd have taken migration over the last three years, it would have been a much reduced figure. Oh yes, of course it was, the last three years have been a recession, what else would you expect. We don't think it is sensible to plan for a recession. And indeed, given the number of dwellings that are proposed by the County Council, we see from completion rates that in fact those figures, broadly compare to the sort of completion rates we've had through the recession. This then is essentially as we see it, a plan for the recession. It is not a plan for the needs of the people of North Yorkshire. And indeed, in efforts to des to also confirm our reasonableness in the figure that we've put forward, despite the fact that it's much higher than the counties, I have included in my submission, paragraph thirty nine, that there are a number of factors we could have taken into account, but haven't have chosen not to do so, er which would have in fact upped the dwelling requirement. And one of them to some extent has has has already been discussed. Which was which was that we didn't take the whole of the vacant dwellings, we only took a part, even though we are not aware of any planning policy that will restrict occupation of dwellings as second homes. Thank you. Mr Mr , Thank you for that, er er so we're we're still talking in terms of a difference of just over twelve thousand dwellings between yourselves and the county. Indeed. Er at the risk of upsetting everybody again, can I go back to the point which has been made by North Yorkshire on this summary sheet here. To the apparent difference between yourselves and them on the death statistics. Yeah. I mean is this real or is it a red herring, which? Well I think it's only part of the picture, that is one element of er the whole make up of er of the population structure. And therefore, it takes one element and er it it erm it it seeks to highlight that particular element. I would also say that in fact er in in the paper that the number of deaths is converted into houses by app application of a factor of one point seven. Which I understand is the pensioner h er occupancy rate. I I In other words, all the extra deaths are going to occur only in pensioners? That may be very good news for the people of South Yorkshire who are below the age of sixty five, but I don't think it's realistic. Erm and so er I think that that is a slightly over-exaggerated figure anyway, and should be more like four thousand one hundred dwellings, even on this basis. But that said, erm what what it what the position is, er i is that we have put into the model Well we haven't put it into the model because it was given to us a part of the model and possibly by now North Yorkshire may have the revised model, No they haven't yet. But erm and essentially, the difference is this, if I can illustrate it by means of reference to appendix four in er N Y two of o o of North Yorkshire. It seems to me from looking at the figures within the projections that what North Yorkshire are are planning is that we'll have a return to that widening black area that's part of that particular diagram. What we are saying, and this is as a result of figures which are supplied by O P C S is that we are broadly saying that we will remain in this narrow band towards the end. Mm. And that essentially is the difference. And erm since we're both to some extent, crystal ball gazing, I suggest it's a matter of choice which to believe is most likely. Thank you. Mr . Steven ,. I think I can help you on the particular limited point of deaths and their effect. Erm You asked some while ago whether it shouldn't be possible at least to have a an agreed view on how many people are dying as it were. But what is more difficult is to have an agreed view on how many people will die and at what rate, in the year two thousand and one and beyond. Erm I have laid round the table this morning, and I hope you have it, a single sheet of paper which sets out the component differences between the projections and the County Council. I only want to speak at this juncture on the element of that which is due to lower mortality as I call it, I E deaths and this is addressed in paragraph five and in the table at the bottom which shows an effect of about two thousand er extra households, due to lower mortality rate assumptions in our projections. Lower that is than the County Council. The difference arises essentially from an improvement which is now evident in the latest national projections. And those date from a nineteen ninety one base, as compared to what was being forecast from the nineteen eighty nine. Thank you. Any view from the county on that point? Mrs . Mrs , North Yorkshire County Council. I think one point that seems to have bis been missed by the H B F or is the fact that the population is growing. I too do have increased erm life expectancy for the very elderly, in our figures, the number of eighty five increased by sixty percent. We are not trying to say that the number of deaths are going to increases substantially so that the population is not growing. Within the sorry within the H B F projections, the populations grows by seventy thousand persons, so even though we have increased death statistics, mortality statistics where life expectancy is going to increase, by applying those onto a higher population you're naturally going to have more deaths. I don't see how that you can possible reduce the number of deaths within the county, or even maintain it at the same level. With this sort of growth. And migration is restricted to the very young, we do have high levels of migration by those in retirement age groups. Can I add a supplementary er c coming back er. I think it's very instructive that er H B F didn't deny that they'd made a mistake on this number and just talking about old people, er the fact is that eighty five percent of deaths in the county occur to people aged over sixty five. And so er there is a very strong correlation between er age and death unfortunately. And we're not trying to er be er unduly morbid about this, but recognize the facts of life. Er the er narrow band that is referred to in eighty nine, nineteen ninety one between births and deaths. We would be very pleased to see it continue to narrow, indeed we we we we we wouldn't wish to to see it revert, but that again is a demographic fact. Er not because of the number of deaths is going to vary sig very significantly as Mrs said, we we are allowing it to improve over time gradually. But it's a factor because of the births is more volatile. And the numbers of births will reduce and so there will be more deaths. Er m more of a natural change. I I I Roy , House Builders Federation. I I think I must come back with the fact that I haven't denied we made made a mistake. I haven't confirmed it either. Erm the simple fact is that the factors that have gone into the model that which we have used, have been the nineteen ninety one based fertility, mortality and infant mortality rates. And have been the nineteen ninety one based,correc local correction factors. The fact that it gives a different result from the ones that North Yorkshire have used, certainly they've used the neight eight nineteen eighty nine based fertility, mortality, infant mortality rates. I'm not sure what local correction factor they've used. I thought from the discussion we had a month or so ago, that they've used the eighty three based correction factors, but it maybe something else because the description this morning was given it was some lo other local one. But nevertheless it's a different one. The fact of the matter is we've used different factors. I used ones supplied which come effec effectively from government sources. They have used some other. They are different, but they're not necessarily right or wrong. Mrs , North Yorkshire County Council. The actual local correction factors that are supplied by the Institute are calculated by themselves. They do look at the statistics the government statistics for fertility and mortality, but they have then the ability to amend, to adjust to local erm to to match up with local information. But they are supplied by the Institute and not the government. I don't want to be picky about this but but I mean they are government based. It's a comparison of of what's happening in the county in terms of registrations of births and deaths, and what's happening nationally. So of course they're based on national figures. I I have a I have a nasty suspicion that we could go on all day like this if if I allowed it to happen. Er er I d I don't think that we as a panel are necessarily going to ever and and and it may not be our role in fact to do so, to come to a judgement on it, but I would have thought as a matter of common sense, and common agreement, that there should be some er way in which the various parties would come together on the basic demographic statistics and would certainly accept that certain basic projections should be used i in looking forward. But before I move on to suggest we have a break for coffee, is there anyone else would like to pick up any points on the demographic matters that we've been discussing, leaving aside the discussions on migration. come back to that later on. Leeds, Mr from Leeds. Yes, Ed from Leeds City Council. Yes chair I I'd like to raise a question. Is it legitimate for North Yorkshire to include environmental discounts in their calculation? And I say that because as Mr touched on in his introduction, the West Yorkshire districts are set a methodology for the definition of their housing requirement, buy R P G two. Strategic guidance for West Yorkshire. Now that guidance does not entitle the West Yorkshire districts to introduce environmental constraints the calculation of their housing requirement. Necessarily therefore, if North Yorkshire proceed with environmental constraints applying in their county as a whole, the proper planning of the region is being frustrated because somebody is not being planned for. Mr . Can I just clarify er this point that the concept of environmental discounts is not one that's been pursued by the County Council, though the Secretary of State quite clearly requires local to take into account environmental consideration. Environmental discounts and our comments on those are in relation to a concept, I think introduced largely by er the House Builders Federation. And our comments are to what you should or should not include erm as an environmental discount. So it's not our concept, we're not applying environmental discounts. The County Council's position is that er it has taken on board, environmental considerations. I think if you look at the House Builder's Federation's papers, there you will see, their idea of environmental discount. I think environmental discount and environmental considerations are factors which we'll come back to in in looking at the migration rates, so you're going to have another shot at this one. Mr . Yes thank you chair. Erm it's really just coming back on the issue of concealed household earlier. Er notice from the York City Council's submission, there is a difference in opinion between ourselves and the county on the calculation of housing requirement for the City of York. That what is discussing this morning, a relatively minor difference in terms of numbers. Now it does in fact arise from this issue of concealed households. Erm I think it is one of the important that should be emphasized. I think as Mr did say, erm the issue of affordable housing is a very real one. The government guidance er in P G three makes it very clear now that it's an issue we do have to address and if we don't for land requirement. We live in urban areas as well as rural areas. Erm . And so we have considered that an additional should be made in the City of York to take account of a policy objective of reducing the level of concealed and sharing households. Thank you for that. Can I just finish this this this session with one question back to North Yorkshire because I think you said, Within your sorry within your Sorry I'll come back to you, Within your projections you actually take account of concealed households. They are identified . True or false? False. They are identified within the census. Yes. The additional dwellings are not added on to eliminate the problem. However as the actual number of dwellings increased, the proportion of those living in concealed households does actually reduce. Right okay. I understand now what you're saying. Mr . Steven ,. Two small points sir still on these technicalities of projections. And the first is to pick up on concealed households and just to add to the points that have already been made that erm neither the House Builders Federation nor ourselves are assuming that all be housed, but the projected number is five thousand whereas we're housing three thousand odd of them. But also to say that elsewhere in this region, planning is on a basis that all consumer households will be housed. West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire strategic guidance housing numbers include all concealed households. So if we are to have a consistent regional planning framework, that should be weighed in the balance as to whether they're taken into account in North Yorkshire. I also want to to actually draw your attention to one item on household rates. I hesitate to do so because that's actually a source of difference between us and the County Council. But there are parties round this table who have nostalgic hankering for a projections. And I've put around today a short paper which has a a graph attached to it which I think adds to the explanation when I draw your attention to. It's a graph of average household size in North Yorkshire, and it's to that extent it's an attempt to summarize into one figure, the headship rate effect as it affects average household size. The the falling line in er in a continuous line is . Derived either from County Council sources or actual census reports so that is as it were, fact. And when you come to the lines on the right hand side, you have two views of the future, which are labelled eighty five based and eighty nine based. And the are these are the D O E's projected household sizes from those two sets of household projections. And I think the point the graph makes very clearly is that the eighty nine based set up here at least in my view, to fit far better to what has been happening than eighty five based set. Not only had a much slower rate of fall, but are actually detached nineteen ninety one from what we know has been happening. Thank you. Thank you. Mr Mr ? Yes. Chairman representing . I'd like to ask a question please of Mr . Could he explain or clarify please what his unrestrained land, this four hundred and ninety two hectares. Is it erm the national parks and greenbelt or I'd like to understand what it means. Erm the if if if you turn to the er Selby submission on H one, you'll find a table at the back of that submission and that's where that's the that's where that the basis of that. Could could you Are you happy with that? Erm. Would you like it spelt out? I'd like to turn turn to the . Selby? Selby. Selby H one. Have a look at it while we're having Coffee Mr . Can we have a break now for fifteen minutes? Come back at quarter to twelve. are you . No that's . Yes sir the erm Mr Cowie. Mr Grigson the positive paper this morning was er one item and also the more general question of the nineteen eighty nine projections closer than the nineteen eighty five ones. Er we've used the nineteen eighty nine ones but we are reluctant to do so. We don't necessarily believe that they are all correct in what they say. Sorry the nineteen eighty nine projections for what? Headship. Erm they're obtained by looking at the results of the labour force survey which is a very small proportion of households surveyed each year. And so there must be an element of doubt over having updated from nineteen eighty one here to nineteen eighty nine. Er we are confirmed in our reservations about this by the results of the regional census study as I noted in my brief commentary N Y three. Erm the point about the regional census study was that it did a reasonably good job of analyzing the present situation, but not a very good job of the projections. And we did compare the eighty nine based headship rates come from that ninety one against the census in . And it showed er some doubt about the er actually levels of comparison, but there was a question mark they raised, specifically about North Yorkshire. North Yorkshire in that context was different to what they found in the rest of the region. There is n there is a doubt about whether the eighty nine headship rates are appropriate. Had we used the eighty five ones, the housing provision would be some ten thousand or so fewer than it is. Two thousand and six. Sorry could you repeat Ten thousand. Ten thousand. The second small point I just wish to reemphasize was er coming from what the House Builders Federation said earlier about the house builders being the people who are looking after the interests os North Yorkshire locals. I would remind all concerned that the local needs element in the predictions is sixteen and a half thousand dwellings. This as far as I'm aware hasn't been challenged by anybody else. So any dwellings over and above sixteen and a half thousand, would only be taken by people moving into the county and not by locals. And so it would not be right to say that we're not looking after the local element of the population. I don't think that was necessarily the drift of the the House Builders Comment. But er I'll leave that. Your comment about the headship rates raise an interesting issue, in fact goes back to the comment Mr made, about the West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire who've got a consistent approach in projecting . Is that correct? That's correct . I'm not sure whether Mrs is either able or would wish to comment necessarily at this stage but er and I but is there any possibility that in the course of the operating the R P G, although I know that circulates to me certainly . Is there any likelihood that that consistency of approach which is being used by the South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire Counties, would er could be adap adopted for o by other authorities in the North Yorkshire County . Thank you chairman. Margaret , D O E. The erm draft of or the advice that the local planning authorities intend to give to the secretary of state is currently out for consultation, we hope that it will be submitted by the end of the year. At the moment the figures of housing provision in that draft advice are rat are done on a rather different basis for West Yorkshire as opposed to the other counties in the region. it remains to be seen what figures are included when it is submitted to the Secretary of State and what view he takes on that. But certainly when we in the regional office get that that advice before before we put a submission to ministers, we will of course try to reconcile the figures so that they are on a consistent basis. As for Mr 's point that Not Mr b Steven 's point that the erm figures for the strategic guidance for West and South Yorkshire were done on a different basis, those figures with the exception of Sheffield, were erm figures that were put in by the local planning authorities, the Secretary of State accepted those figures, they were done on the nineteen eighty five based household projections, coupled with different assumptions about vacancy rates and demolitions etcetera, and the Secretary of State accepted those figures. Erm in my view the Secretary of State may come to the view on the latest figures that are available for him and erm No that is what I hope he will do when it comes to erm producing regional guidance. Thank you. I m I must confess I'm one of these simple folk who thought that once we got the nineteen ninety one census figures through then it would it would all start into place. Me too chairman. However Can can I just? Carry on. I was going to add a supplementary point er on that very issue of the nineteen ninety one census. Er referring to the graph in er Mr 's paper, which showed that er the ninete well purported to show the nineteen eighty nine based headship rate figures were more in line with past experience. Er that very much depends on the er intervening line at nineteen ninety one. And I'm just wondering whether er the er point at nineteen ninety one is a correct v in view of the under-enumeration er in the census which isn't taken into account . So it could be that there were line from eighty one would come up to the eight five based starting point er a rather than the eighty nine based starting point on the graph. We can't look into it because it's only just been given to us. I I would I would suspect that it needs some some interpretation. . Has anybody or or else want to make any comments on on the . I'd like to move on to this er this issue of migration. Chairman I I wonder whether I could just make a sort of general statement from the department's view before we go on to a particular issue if I may. Erm I hope it didn't take too long to read our statement. . It was rather shorter than than everybody else's. . Erm I understand that the House Builders Federation have written to my headquarters on expressing concern about the possible temerity of the regional office having actually put forward a suggested figure for housing provision in North Yorkshire. We thought from where we sat that the department should stand up and be counted along with all the other participants around the table. I hope you will view that figure in that light. It is not necessarily the Secretary of State's definitive view, it is the view that erm the regional office have come to given the erm evidence presented presented at the time. Erm secondly, I'm not a statistician, I am unable to comment about all the technicalities of the the various assumptions that go into things but some of the people sitting around this table will know that I've been in Yorkshire and Humberside for quite some time . I therefore have a fair amount experience of this region and also erm I have been involved in quite a lot of erm estimates of housing provision over the years. We've set out the assumptions that erm we used as a basis for our projections in the note in front of you. I hold hold no great sway to those assumptions. I'm sure many people sitting around this table could drive a horse and cart through any of them. But I believe that what you should do with trying to come to estimates of housing provision, is to put together the best technical assumptions that you can, to then sit down and take a long hard look at the figures based on the erm the policies of the County Council as approved by the Secretary of State in previous structure plan approvals, the current government policy. I have particularly in mind, the erm regeneration initiatives of this government, the experience that erm you know of an area and erm the experience of what is happening in neighbouring counties. This chairman is what we have done. Our conclusions for what they are worth are set out and we come to a figure of about forty five thousand. Well. Thank you. Yes well Mm. for the next day and a half. Can I just come back to this migration question. And . But the difference between the H B F and the County Council on migration is somewhere in the order of four thousand . No No . Now on a North Yorkshire I can't remember which paper it is. It's in one of those. in one of those papers, there is a figure a hundred percent migration forty six thousand . Correct? Yes. Now very simple if I deduct forty one thousand two hundred from forty six thousand you'll probably say I'm doing the wrong sum. Erm we have a difference of four thousand eight hundred. Now is that difference four thousand eight hundred, due to wastage or entirely to your adjustments to take account of environmental considerations? Yes that is . The question is do I need ? I'm chairman . I think it's impossible to explore why there is a difference, it does not explain why the matters we have already discussed, like vacancies,households and death rates why there is a difference between what the County Council say is one hundred percent , and what the H B F and others are advocating which is considerably more. First of all can I check that I am right in saying that the difference between the H B F's figures of fifty three thousand and the County Council's figure of forty six thousand is explained by the vacancies, concealed households, death rates etcetera. Yes. Can I short circuit that question and say, what in fact is your hundred percent ? Erm Roy , House Builders Federation. Erm fifty five thousand e No sorry, I'll have to look that up. One hundred percent migration. Never mind the other factors concealed households. Fi Yeah. Fifty five thousand seven hundred. . Erm Steven ,. It would be fifty four thousand eight hundred if there was no reduction for environmental considerations. To what extent is the difference between that figure or those figures and the County Council's forty six thousand, not explained by what ? Roy , House Builders Federation. My understanding is that there there there isn't any difference that is not explained by those. Those those figures. Erm the difference between us is of the order of ten thousand I think. Erm Yeah. That's a for your calculations Mhm. No I'll have to I'll I'll I'm afraid I'll have to withdraw that that that comment. There is not erm I I I I would erm I have the figures ready to hand but . I think Peter , North Yorkshire. I think on this side there's also a degree of corporate confusion at North Yorkshire about the what exactly the what exactly we we we're trying to establish during this current round of er . I'm trying to establish put down a figure of forty six thousand for migration. That was taken ,for vacant dwellings. Yes. What we are trying at this stage, is the extent to which the difference between the H B F's of fifty five thousand, is explained by any technical treatment of migration, as opposed to. Chairman I wonder wonder whether it would help if I quoted from the erm the study into b the census information. The and and and other information. Their figure for North Yorkshire for eighty one to ninety one, from the National Health Service register, was forty seven point two inward. The residual estimate which is from the census figures, was fifty point nine. I don't know whether that helps in any way . Roy , House Builders Federation. Er that they're they're not the figures that ei either the county or ourselves started from. . I think I can answer your original question now if I may. Erm I think I'm right in saying that the difference on a hundred percent migration between the House Builders Federation and the County Council, is accounted for by the technical differences that we've talked about this morning, one thousand six hundred. Seven hundred and forty which you may card to ignore, that there are some base dwellings. Yeah. Two thousand four hundred and ninety on vacancies. And three thousand one hundred and seventy concealed households. And the remaining difference which I estimate to be one thousand five hundred, is really the I think is the difference in the treatment of students. Martin , North Yorkshire. I think we all agree with er Mr , that that there is a technical element to migration figures which is our fifteen hundred dwellings. As a a difference between us on technical measure. Sir if I could complete the er arithmetic, I think it would be helpful, if you were to look again at the single page note that was handed on this morning. At the table, in paragraph seven where we set out our differences from the County Council. I appreciate this is not in quite the form you asked the question, but you asked the question in terms of the differences apart from migration considerations. And as I'm able to do the arithmetic, the difference between the County Council's full migration which is forty six thousand two hundred, and ours with no environmental reduction which I gave you as fifty four thousand eight hundred, comes if I've done my arithmetic right, to eight thousand six hundred. If that's the difference between us which are not due to migration environment. If you now look at the table, you'll see that that's made out of three thousand two hundred for concealed households. Two thousand one hundred for a constant vacancy proportion. A difference of one thousand one hundred in the base dwellings stock which I've not discussed and don't propose to go into. And two thousand for the lower death rates, national projections which I've already mentioned. And I think that will be roughly of the order of eight thousand six hundred, so those are our component differences. Yeah well, does anybody want to make any comment on that because I'm I'm quite environmental considerations Yes. Mr . Er John , of of Consultants on behalf of the er Council for the Protection of Rural England. Erm you you've asked er chairman for for a general comment on on what's been referred to as environmental discount, environmental considerations and so forth. I I think the C P R E's general comments and and you'll see from our our evidence that we we've deliberately not entered into the the the debate that you you've heard to date this morning. Er our general response is is that the approach for the County Council is is to be commended erm i in terms of I think, interpreting the true spirit of of of government guidance in in plan making, that erm the the the the discussion about figures is but one consideration. Er to to to take into account wh when coming to agreement as to what the overall levels should be. Erm I think we feel quite strongly that that erm er the the emphasis that should be placed on environmental considerations is is considerable. Erm and as such, erm are concerned that perhaps i it is becoming a a secondary element erm i i in in the debate. In in that it's just being er interpreted as a percentage reduction erm as t to migration rates. Erm and I think just by way of introductory comment, I I refer to the the paper that that North Yorkshire put round, N Y eleven, erm in which there there's a far fuller discussion in there of what of what the environmental constraints are and what the considerations should be. Er county-wide, in terms of er how they should be reflected erm in the figures. And I think er w we're concerned that erm the the case presented by the county has in in concentrating on migration, perhaps they haven't haven't fully expanded on on the points that they've raised in document N Y eleven. I wonder if by way of introduction, the county might wish to to comment on that. Do you want to ? Well I re Peter , North Yorkshire. I don't wonder whether it would be helpful just step back a bit and just look at the county council's view as to how it should treat migration in the light of what the Secretary of State has approved on two occasions, when this issue has come up. On the issue of migration and it's relationship with with adjoining counties. And our view is that whichever way you look at approved structure plan and the two decisions of the Secretary of State, first of all in er er on the approved structure plan and secondly, on the first alteration to the structure plan. Quite clearly there there is recognition that there should be some limit to the level of migration er inward migration in North Yorkshire. And the Secreta the Secretary of State is quite clear that the environmental constraint in North Yorkshire, is a particularly important one. Although we might try to decision method, the overall stress of the Secretary of State's decision methods, as they affect North Yorkshire, is that there must be some limit er to migration largely for environmental considerations and indeed, the panel in nineteen eighty seven were very concerned that er migration would not be slowed quickly enough er in North Yorkshire. So the there is the County Council we must try er and moderate migration. And it would appear to many rather strained within that agreed by the Secretary of State, a matter of general principle, the County Council accepted past level er of migration without looking er at the implications er of that. And indeed there are some who make think that the County Council has been too generous in that the reduction from the hundred percent migration in four districts, er amounts only to somewhere about four and a half er thousand dwellings. Now within that overall context, and H B F say we have no right to do that, it conflicts with . We say that it is important to the general stress erm of the structure plan. There should be some reduction er in migration er into North Yorkshire. That's the basic philosophy of the County Council's approach er in this plan. Yes er Joe representing Sams Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster. There is a technical difference that I should erm draw attention, draw the panel's attention to between ourselves and erm other p other in the migration rates. We believe that the migration rates that should be used should be a three year average rather than an eight or a ten year average. Our reasons for that are that the especially the eight year average used by the County Council, are unduly skewed by the boom of the late eighties, and give in our view, to high a trend t to erm to work from. Er the second reason that we would suggest this to the panel is that it is actually er used by OPCAS, the three year average is used by OPCAS rather than an eight year average. And as far as I can see, the only reason for an eight year average is because that was accepted by the previous panel. Well I don't believe that that should necessarily be a reason why it should be accepted in this case in by this panel. And it would in our view give a more accurate reflection of current trends if a shorter period were used. but if you're using three year average,three recent three years. that you in fact recession. Well in fact we we do answer that point in our submissions that in fact it does take in Our three year average does take into account the tail end of the boom. So it does actually span the end of the boom, the beginnings of the recession. Yes, gentleman, the problem is the shorter the period, the less chance you have of getting a measurement which is necessarily representative of a general trend. Yes I I I would accept that as a general point yes that that that that that that the greater number of years, the more likely you are to get a long term trend. But er there is a a and I wouldn inevitably er one does stray into I know want it in particular points at the moment, but there is a policy consideration to be borne in mind as well, which erm does suggest that past trends should not necessarily be projected into the future. And i from a technical point of view I would support my case by saying that if OPCAS use it, it's good enough for us if it's good enough for OPCAS. . Can I I know we've got two people wanting to make comments on this . Mr . Yes chairman, er Mike Cleveland County Council. Er I'm not quite sure what er stage you want us to b be involved on this intensive policy but I I can't comment on the the technicalities of the vacancy rates even migration rates. But erm in terms of policy, erm Cleveland County Council supports the approach that North Yorkshire and the district councils in the area are taking. Er on two counts in terms of policy. Er and following what er Miss indicated. Erm we have a major regeneration er issue in Cleveland and would like to retain as much of the population within the urban area within the compact urban area that we have as possible. And secondly we do recognize the quality of the countryside South of Cleveland and need to to retain its character and the lit the character of its villages which erm in fact do add to the attractions of the area when you're trying to e erm bring in new industry. Er undoubtedly a number of erm our res er our our er employed people, do live in the area immediately adjoining to the South and er the figures that Hambleton have produced and our own estimates based on the National Health er Service records on migration, do indicate that there is a strong movement er on an annual basis into the North Yorkshire area and in particular the sort of area. And we do recognize there are limits on the sort of growth in that area. So erm I can give you more detailed figures on a progressive excuse me. A progressive reduction in the rate of inward migration. And I I'd refer the panel erm to the written statement of the county structure plan of nineteen seventy nine, erm and the section entitled, the Strategic Framework, paragraph three nine on page ten. Which states erm the strategy envisag envisages a progressive reduction in the rate of the population growth from this source, as the supply of housing land is reduced to levels more closely related to the needs arising from North Yorkshire. Now the original structure plan recognized that because of the substantial number of housing commitments at that time, erm it wasn't possible erm to er bring down the levels immediately. And it was going to be a long term strategy. The term, long term strategy in fact appears in a number of instances erm throughout those pages. And I'd refer you to paragraph three ten and also paragraph four two two which I'd like to quote a short erm element from. And this states erm that Its effectiveness erm must be must be considered as a long term rather than a short term objective. The structure plan can not be seen for providing for a major or sudden change in direction. It's essentially evolutionary in its approach . So the point erm I wish to make erm on er Mr 's observations, is that it's not the strategy of the structure plan was not simply erm to seek an initial reduction erm in the rate of residential development in the county and then that roll that rate forward in progressive erm amendments to the structure plan, Hambleton District Council believes that the logical interpretation of these statements is that a progressive reduction er in house building and the rates of migration should be sought through subsequent alterations to the plan. Now we would add that representations which seek to achieve a continuation of past building rates, or a continuation of past migration levels, are not in accord with the strategy as originally approved. Finally, I'd refer you to erm the Secretary of State's decision letter of the twenty sixth of November nineteen eighty where in paragraph one he takes note of the recent justification and in paragraph six four, he states that overall, the Secretary of State broadly approves the main objective of the housing policies of the plan of reducing inward migration into the county. Yes I'd j I'd just like to to pick up on on two points er, one made by Mr , one made by Mr . Erm I think er Mr said I think that that C P R E hasn't actually offered a solution in this debate, just just raised questions. I don't think that's strictly true but I do think that the discussion we've heard so far er has fully justified erm the the raising of some fundamental questions about the the the the method of projections. Er and the point about not offering a solution, C P R E clearly has in in erm taking to to go on to talk about the subsequent parts of policy H one and H two, the County Council's figures and then doing an analysis of those in relation to the new settlement, but I appreciate chairman that erm we'll come back to that. Mr raised the point about erm the environmental appraisal of of development plans, erm as set out in P P G twelve which is is indicative of a a a new er a new framework in which plans should be prepared. And and I would argue that that er an alteration to a structure plan of this significance, should should fall within the remit of P P G twelve. My understanding of what Mr was saying was that because it's an alteration rather than a replacement structure plan, that guidance no longer applies. That's not my understanding of how government guidance works. Peter , North Yorkshire. I think Mr picked up on the points that I really wanted to address in Mr 's remarks. Other than to say, the Secretary of State didn't limit his concern to reducing rates of development. Right through the decision letters, you get two elements. The effect of excessive development on the environment in North Yorkshire, and the second on is a relationship with places like Cleveland and West Yorkshire and the need to continue to see regeneration within those areas. It was a much broader package of for the Secretary of State than I think Mr , er suggests. The other point which Mr made on the difficulties of er manipulating migration. And I think, quite cl clearly, there are difficulties in manipulating migration. What it does require are complementary policies either side er of county boundaries. Mr , er about the policies of Cleveland within their area, to retain their population by making massive allocations of land. Er adjacent er to a North Yorkshire boundary. And if you go to places like erm Guisborough, erm er and South Middlesbrough there you will see a range of housing types available for range of groups in the community. If they weren't there, those houses, I suspect a large proportion of those people would now be living in North Yorkshire. So there's a requirement of complementary policies. And the County Council's consistently said to the West Yorkshire authorities, you must make provision for a range of sites in suitable locations to help draw er development that would othe otherwise come to North Yorkshire. Now something's been said for certainly fifteen years er that I can remember. , Michael,. Several points on the the question of migration as reported or a as included by the Secretary of State in in his decision letters. The first point I'd like to make is that the original decision letter dates from excuse me, twenty sixth of November nineteen eighty. We're now thirteen years further on. I think whilst the Secretary of State has clearly said what he's said in that decision letter. I think we have to remind ourselves that that is thirteen years old and that circumstances have changed. Not least in the neighbouring metropolitan areas, where urban regeneration is thirteen years old. There's substantial improvement, particularly in West Yorkshire, and that does need to be taken into account. I'll go on to say that on the question of progressive migration restraint, I don't think anybody round this table is suggesting otherwise. The population projections that we have seen in front of us we h have discussed, are based upon what has happened in the county over the past eight years. That is that is where the migration projections have come from. The these migration flows are already constrained by s existing structure plan policies. I think the close co-relationship between the rate of building, rate of past building and structure plan requirements, shows that those policies have teeth. Th that has been what's happened, there has been a reduction in migration flow. Or or not in migration flow but in net inward migration. These population projections we have, the hundred percent projections of the H B F of fifty five point K, of North Yorkshire of forty six point two K, of of fifty four point eight. None of the requests for housing requirement are at that level. That therefore assumes a continuing an i an increasingly progressive restraint on migration. . Mr Sorry Mr . Right, er Ray , House Builders Federation. Erm Mr referred to er put great store it seemed to me on the long term effectiveness of of of reducing er building. I'd just make the simple point that a sudden twelve point five percent reduction, I referred to it this morning, er in in building, is not progressively and long term, it's a sudden change. Erm and I think that erm the C P R E have most definitely misquoted what I said. I'll repeat the point. I'm not saying that P P G twelve does not apply. But I'm making the point, it does apply but it has to be justified. You have to justify the restraints that you make. My criticism of the restraints that have been applied by the County Council, is that they have not been justified. And we would regard them as arbitrary. And I would also point out that we are not proposing excessive development, in one of the papers I've I've put round, and I repeat the point I made it earlier. We're talking about point one nine percent. Point one nine percent of the remaining unrestrained land. As an addition. And that presupposes in that calculation, if you were taking the worst case, that that would all be greenfield land. The truth of the matter is of course it probably wouldn't be all greenfield land, but that's the worst case that I'm talking about. S O I think that it would be a very special place if it was unable to absorb that amount of development. Miss . Yeah. , D O E. I merely wish to reiterate government policy, as reinforced by my Secretary of State, John Gummer, last week in the terms of the single bu regeneration budget. And the emphasis that government places on regeneration of the urban areas. Are you going to submit that document? If you wish,by all means yes . It seems to me to be important enough to be worth tabling if that can be arranged . Fine fine. Would you like would you like the press release? Yes. Please. Yeah. Mr , do you want to come back on the point made on the other side of the room about your arbitrary selection of building rates? I think presumably you'll be wishing at a later stage to look at what we're proposing in erm in individual districts. And one against another. I think the quite clearly what comes out erm of reading our papers and the papers of the district, is the er tremendous degree of consultation that's taken place on a number of occasions back and forth between district and making use of er of emerging working on er on local plans across the county. Erm to make sure that the proposals the County Council er is is putting forward are are soundly based. And we'd elaborate that when we talk about er individual districts. I think it might be worth adjourning ask if there are any more demographic . And start again . Right. I'd like to say a little bit about this table. Now? Mm. Mhm. Any more points anybody wants to make on the demographic aspects? The migration rates. environment, I don't know whether that's later Well I think we'll probably deal with that this afternoon. Yeah. Yeah. There's a Harrogate. Mr . Thank you, er David , Harrogate Borough Council. Er one or two small points I'd like to make. Mr , er a moment ago congratulated the County Council in fact on the success of the strategy in reducing migration over the last ten years or so. He then went on to say it's not actually possible to control the rate of migration and I'm sure that the the s success of of the policy in the past shows that that that is not the case. That it is possible through the appropriate use of policies, to bring down levels of immigration into the county. Er Mr also made the point that er urban regeneration erm no longer seems to have the emphasis that it did have. er I'm sure that the er representatives from the West Yorkshire authorities wi will say that their that objective is still extremely important in the in the respective U D Ps. Erm it seems to me that the emphasis has changed slightly in the representations being made by the West Yorkshire authorities and that they're now saying that it's much more difficult for them to accommodate housing developments within their own er districts. And that therefore, that growth should be exported to North Yorkshire. Er another minor point, er Mr n erm said that e the level of restraints that we're er seeking to or that the County Council is seeking to impose, represents a sudden restriction on house-building levels in in North Yorkshire. That certainly wouldn't be the case in Harrogate. Erm we would be allocating land through our local plan for the year two thousand and six. That restriction suddenly wouldn't be imposed in the next two or three years, it would be a gradual reduction through to to the year two thousand and six. And the point about erm er the extra development taking up only point one percent of the counties unrestricted land, erm is is statistical point really. It's even less taking up i i er land being taken up in the region as a whole, it's even less in terms of the U K. The important point is what it means for the settlement to the environment of North Yorkshire. And er that level of development, at five hundred hectares, is an extremely large area of land, in very sensitive locations, particularly around the main urban areas, which are restricted to a great degree. Thank you. I think we'll come back to that when we start looking at the county district by district as it were. I think Miss would like to make some comment about the table, which was presented to her. I thought you might like an for the lunch hour. Erm as the notes to this table indicate, it is a compilation by the panel secretary of what we believe is before us. You will have noticed there are some pregnant gaps on this table. We're not optimistic that we will fill them all, but one, we can for example talk about conversions. The more numerical evidence we can have before us, the better. As the chairman also said, the table points up some interesting questions. One of those interesting questions is, for example, the relationship between column H and column I and the way in which those relationships change as we move from one district to another. Thoughts for lunch time. Mr . of . Er this is clearly go going to become an important schedule and I think it you will inevitably run into difficulties here on different definitions of allocations for example. Erm if you er if I take the Greater York area for example, erm if you er if I take the Greater York area for example , the County Council erm have included in their figure of four thousand seven hundred and ten units, no new allocations, is my understanding. Right. Yes. Yeah. Yeah . This is the sort of thing we want to discuss as we go through each of the areas which we shall do under matter one C. Or one C. But I think there must be I I would suggest to you that you sh you should request a discussion between the principle parties here to agree what allocations they're taking, whether in adopted plans or proposed plans or previous plans and what windfalls. One of the great problems of this schedule would be, the definition of the amount of windfalls, bearing in mind that many of the local plans coming forward erm are about to be produced rather than have just been produced. Yeah yeah. And I think that it is an important er qualification to this schedule that the principle parties can agree what the in inputted are. Indeed and I would hope our discussion of the provision within individual districts, will amend many of these figures. Certainly those which are relate to the future as opposed to what has happened in the past. Okay thank you. Mr . Martin , North Yorkshire County Council. Just a couple of of quick comments er er chairman just on the the the vacant co blank columns you have, J K L and M. Erm whilst the County Council can provide you with some figures on vacancies at a district level, we would be very loathe to make any comment on the assumptions for conversions and windfall sites. We feel that this is very much a matter for the district councils in the preparation of their local plans, with their local knowledge which is something we do not have at the county level to be able to to make comment on . Yeah. I I I think we do accept that you probably not be able to fill those gaps. Er some districts may have some knowledge. I mean Hambleton for example having just produced their draft local plan, but other districts are not quite in that position. Yeah. But eventually those gaps would be filled. That's right. But certainly wherever it is possible to put a figure in, then we would appreciate it. Yeah, Could I also just quickly comment on the differences between columns H and I that you've referred to. That this does to a very large extent reflect the differences in local plan preparation across the county. You have already referred to Hambleton's progress . Mm. Yeah Yeah . Which is perhaps not matched with the s quite the same stage by other districts across the county. Yes. Yeah. I think that will be crystallized or become clarified as we get into the discussion, district by district. Mr , you want to come back on that. Er Richard ,. Very briefly, I think the County Council must consider what they're going to do for conversions in windfalls. It's quite clear in in P P G three, paragraph eleven, that structure plans will make clear whether the housing provision figures include allowance from expected supply from conversions and changes of use, as well as from new building. And for unidentified and for losses from demolitions. The exercise must be done and should have been done by now. Mm. Yeah, my objective was not actually to start a debate but to give you some indication of where we were going to go this afternoon. Food for thought. Mr . Leeds City Council. I'd like to come back to policy on migration chair, and I'm grateful to Mr for pointing out that nineteen eighty is thirteen years ag away and things have moved on in every respect demographically. In development terms. We've even got a new planning system. And I venture to suggest we've got new guidance from the Secretary of State. Because we in West Yorkshire have got regional planning guidance is sorry strategic planning guidance issued in nineteen eighty nine Yes. Which tells us how to determine our housing requirements and doesn't ask us to take into account restraint in North Yorkshire. But that S P G is about to be replaced by R P G isn't it? Well we would all welcome that but in in its absence, I suggest that the current policy is defined by the R P G, even though that's not specifically targeted at North Yorkshire, none the less, to be consistent, North Yorkshire should not be entitled to a to reduce arbitrarily, it's er migration assumptions. As I understand it, S P G is your S P G is not geared to the same time horizon is. D O E. Cone I just comment briefly chairman. The Strategic planning guidance goes to two thousand and one. it was based on the figures that the West Yorkshire authorities submitted to the Secretary of State, which was on a policy as I understand it, of containing as much of their population they as as they were possible to. Erm they estimated there was going to be a continued out migration, but the aim of the original West Yorkshire structure plan and the p erm strategic guidance was to contain rather more of the population. Regional planning guidance will go to two thousand and six. We shall have to see what that contains. Yeah. I think that's all we can say at this stage. Mm. Thank you. I unless anybody has got a Mr . Erm Er And Mr second. Just a just a very brief point. Erm it relates to er something that Mr said erm for er for Leeds City Council, that circumstances have moved on. I would suggest that indeed they have moved on erm since erm the original er decision letter of the structure plan. One area in fact that circumstances have moved on is erm on environmental awareness. I think that erm all would agree that now there is greater er concern than ever before about environmental issues. Erm planning legislation and advice in P P Gs erm have made the environment a far more prominent concern of planning than it was when erm the original structure plan was approved. And indeed the alterations were approved in nineteen eighty seven. Erm authorities are expected to show that environmental concerns have been comprehensively and consistently taken into adv erm account in their plans. Erm the planning conversation act nineteen ninety one requires the development plans to include policies for the conservation and that of the natural beauty and amenity of their land. Erm P P G twelve advises that policy should be in line with the concept of sustainable development. And now erm draft advice in P P G thirteen emphasizes the need to reduce the need for travel. Erm again because of the environmental con considerations. Erm and we would suggest that in the light of these new environmental erm of these new requirements and advice, erm it would be unrealistic to er to expect them not to be taken into account in the structure plan and give greater emphasis to the environmental originally environmental concerns of the structure plan. Thank you. Mr . Just to er the Leeds point, er it is actually a stated aim of the Leeds development plan to make adequate provision for the communities housing needs during the plan period, by identification of sufficient land for new dwellings, targeting of some provision for social housing, need groups and support for renewal of the existing stock. And then further in the plan, it deals with the er migration issue, and it says, New household t New household total still assumes that a substantial amount of housing will need to be met outside Leeds as a result of net outward migration from the district. Net out movement of the order of twenty seven thousand, eight hundred people is assumed over the period nineteen e eighty six, two thousand and one. Equivalent to around eleven thousand households. The loss is a little below the strategic guidance figure of thirty thousand two hundred and also represents an improvement over the historic trend. This is consistent a more optimistic view of future economic performance that is appropriate in the light of the counties economic strategy. And that and on the economic strategy which is U D P based. There's a clear implication there, that the U D P policy is moving in the dire the same direction as the Cleveland policy is moving. And that is to make provision for its own population and to claw back economic development er within the boundaries of the area. Mr that was a long quotation, can you submit It's in it's in. My submission on that point is No can you submit the doc a copy of that paper the document. Yes yes I can. It's an extract from the Leeds U D P. Yes I understood that. Our notes weren't that fast. I have I have read it elsewhere and not necessarily having read the doc the whole of the document of the Leeds U D P but on that note, since Leeds leads would you like to Yeah, could I just er respond to Mr and say, this is not the public enquiry into the Leeds development plan. Er obviously we will er justify our position at that public enquiry. Er I'm simply talking about a level playing field. What is the framework within which we are operating at the moment. And I'm again grateful to Mr for reminding the panel of the con the constraints of the environmental policies within which we all work, not just North Yorkshire authorities, we're all required to look at environmental considerations. What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. And er if if it's appropriate for North Yorkshire to apply environmental constraints within the whole of its area, I'm not talking about particular districts but in in the whole of its area, then it is appropriate for Leeds and Bradford and the metropolitan districts to to do exactly the same thing. And that will just lead to planning chaos because obviously somebody's going to fall between the plans. Thank you for R P G. On on on that note, can I suggest we adjourn for lunch, meet back here at two o'clock, prompt start. . So Mr , can you tell me whereabouts you were born in Nottingham and when? Well it so happens I was not born in Nottingham, though my early memories are of Nottingham, right even from infant school, which er started at five years of age till about seven. But in fact I was born in , Northamptonshire. My father being a railwayman and er asking and doing various jobs from being ordinary shunter and man-about, eventually graduated by way of He's he was a Lancashire man, you see? And the family really come from in Lancashire? Which is a considerably humble place. Anyway he went about in railway jobs as the years went by and I was born in , taken with the rest to Leicester, City of Leicester, but my early memories was in Nottingham. I don't remember the prior, it's what my parents have told me and the birth certificate shows, of course. And so the first memories is in the meadows of Nottingham, going to infant school about the age don't remember starting, but perhaps I'd be six years of age, and it was a little church school and they were all lady teachers and most of them Mrs and not the Miss which is nowadays er more common. And strange to say, it had coal fires in the winter, huge coal fires to keep it warm, or attempt to do, and most of the classrooms were only divided by portable partitions so that while we went from class to class as the two or three years went by,it really was in one long building and quite adequate for the time. How big were the classes then? Can you recall that? I recall being in the first class and er a teacher coming to me, as I weren't paying much attention I think, and to this day I shall remember and never forget, she just folded my arms in front of me and says, Percy, you're not listening, you'll have to have a rest. And she put my head on my hands on the desk in front of me and believe me, I went to sleep, it was must have been very, very new, compared to being at home and perhaps being laid there. But they're they were all kind ladies and er the thing that they punished us with really was made of cardboard, like er, er a pointer or a stick, it was a pointer that they pointed to the board when they drew things on and told us about them, but sometimes boys By the way, boy sat with girl, at the desk with two in and er it was quite satisfactory, I don't remember any other upset with being there th th th there were two sexes, we were five years of age to begin with and stayed till seven. Anyway, that took a year or two and I even remember taking my next brother to school, me mother saying Take Frank to school and tell Miss , he's your brother and he's five. So I did and it's very strange I remember toddling off with this little chap and er and Miss said, Who is this then? or words to that effect. And remember now, the language of the day, said It's our Frank. And er that was all the particulars I think Miss ever got for him. And that er church school took us to the standard, at that time, called standard one, which was in a big school, about half a mile away and was built by the Nottingham Education Committee and was one of say, six or eight in the Nottingham area, I suppose. And there was a far cry from the kind lady who would lay one's head on a desk and say, You have a sleep. And er In wh In what ways was was it a far cry? How how did the contrast strike you? Well although it was so near, it was really a mining district and ninety percent of the boys We were at separate schools by the way, the ground floors were boys, from the age of seven upwards, till fourteen. Upstairs were the girls, from the similar ages and and one wing of this big school was infants. Which I hadn't known about or my mother and otherwise living near enough they could have s done that school and gone through from five years to er fourteen. Anyway, standard one was a breaking-in for this er other discipline and not quite so easy and learning how to spell. And teacher would er tell us that next week with her spelling lesson she'd want a new word, would we learn one at home? And er er the week following we'd all have to spell the word we'd chose. And it was a simple as that . Again, Oh we'd graduated then from pencils and paper, to pen and ink and paper, the ink being in er a well sunk in the desk in front of us. Each boy had a inkwell and er a pen, blue-black ink and so on and some of the small books that we used for writing in were kept under the desk. Most of the textbooks, were handed to us came from cupboards of storage, of which they must have had about sixty each, those classes were always, from then on, sixty boys in a class for one teacher. Er standard one was er no trouble, except er er pretty timid, remember being timid, the boys could be very rough in play and there was much nudging in the playground as they ran about at their various games. And so to standard two, where the That was th the next year, each class was expected to take about a year, which it did. In st in standard two though, having passed through there, the Headmaster came in near the end of the second year and said because of the number of scholars er some boys would have to miss standard three because there was too many for the class. They could er er er because thi it this would be a birthrate problem not known to us as boys and I along with seven or eight others, were taken to the standard four to start, after the holidays, which was in August. We had a month's holiday in August every year. But to break us into this new er schooling the Headmaster had us in various mornings for an hour and was supposed, well tried, to make a sort of summary of what the lesson would have been in standard three . And believe it or not, one of the subjects was er the geography of England. Now, to this day, I'm a dunce at the geography of England, I know where the principle towns are, I know you go north to Manchester and south to London and generally get about. But the intricacies, I know more about Europe, eventually , and other countries, due to not being having a a briefing by a Headmaster for half an hour of something The group of us, he had eight to ten of us in the room trying to prime us on what we'd missed for a year. And and many times I apologize for asking where various places are, because I just can't visualize Most of the other things from school come without being beckoned, er one thinks of er the economy, they taught about us about various things of the economy. Oh, by this time, er being born in nineteen hundred and five, by nineteen fourteen, that was nine years, the Great War started. Yes, what what impact did that have upon your schooling ? The Great War started and took the scho er This Road school had all men teachers extep except standard one, which was an introduction from infants to grown-up and a matronly lady always called Miss , er broke us into this new sort of discipline and sternness really. The rest er er standard two to standard six, were all male, but lo and behold before I got to standard five, that had all become women and the men had all gone to the into the services. Because although that war didn't have conscription in nineteen fourteen or nineteen fifteen, I believe it started in nineteen sixteen, back end, and er we we'd got all women teachers who were quite a different problem from a school of that nature. Cos a boy in standard five could be getting on for thirteen. There were quite a few dunces,and er some didn't always get moved on and they didn't all make it into the top class, they had to stop again for another year, or period, in the class they were. Yes, I was going to ask, what well, what effect did the er er the substitution of the the male teachers by the women teachers during the the the Great War period? H How do you think it affected the schooling? Well, in my observation, as regards young boys, it er th they played could play them up, the lads would play pranks on the teacher, who would put the best on it for a long time. Worse come to the worse, she brought the Headmaster in with his cane and he was er like the one in the stories, skilled to rule, but anyway his most proficiency was wielding this cane, which was a good three foot long. It wasn't the things you go fishing with, it was a s solid cane of er not hollow, and er I never knew him have another one. But if even if one was late from for school, he had a monitor on the doors to the outside world and when the whistle went for nine o'clock that door was closed and there The boys marshalled in the yard to er get in the lines and marched to the classes. He then dealt with those who were late and those who were late would then appear to be six or seven minutes late because of these other preliminaries. But he brooked nothing, he just asked er, What's made you late? And there's various reasons, whether your mother wanted some milk bringing. By the way, this was the period when I could to a milk shop for a hape'orth of milk, but it's not the halfpenny that people think now, cos the currency's been altered quite a lot, it was very trifling, but it's true. Milk, a little dip of milk was sold, into a jug, there were no bottles, and er you could get some for a ha'penny. And so, you could be late for various things like that, but you got the stick. Oh, so whatever. And er Did it happen frequently? Children getting the stick ? It happened everyday for those who were late. Eventually, the discipline is such as one used your influence on your mother and so if I'm late I'll get the cane, and so on. So er it wasn't pleasant and I didn't have it a lot either, because I never were very big, and I never liked punishment, it made me cry every time. It did, really. It's a cruel thing and especially to hit a boy on his right hand and then expect him to write with it. This I found, at various times, my fingers were suffering from this wallop in the oh, at ten past nine in the morning. But anyway, most things were like that, I think it had to be something like, In his noisy mansion, skilled to rule. It had to be, he had to do something or they would never have er got In other ways in was a lenient school because as the years went by it was, a register was called, a teacher er opened a book and we called numbers. Alas, I found that , my surname, spelt , was always first on the register whichever class I was, so I was number one. And er,l er those whose names er began with er later initials in the alphabet and we didn't have any Z 's, there were no Zilliachas in those days. But they were some well on, lo and behold, could open the door er two or three minutes late and c er call the er number, Yes sir, er as they entered the class and they would get their mark, this being I think you got a red mark if you were late,t to stand out so that an inspector who came down periodically could look down the register and there was the record of who was early and who was late by the colour of the ink-pens, I think. So that was a strange thing too, with this er alphabetical thing. So The only Excuse me, er no, we even had Abbot, A double B, er didn't always get in front but I think it should have done you know, you take the first letter and then you take the . We had Askews and all sorts of, Astills,strange, isn't it? The alphabet? Anyway, that was a simple rhythm there and periodically a chap from the Education Committee used to come and check this register and the classes, and some passed through the class. But that was just er ordinary the geography of this, or the history of that, many battles, Bosworth Field and I was going to ask,d d do you think looking back er th th that the school erm tt taught you to regard certain things as important in life? Was it d d d w was there was there like er erm sort of pa er erm love of country or or did they stress, say the virtues of honesty a a and fairness, can can you remember anything like that? Well I I think the period that embraced my school days, you see I didn't leave till nineteen nineteen and th that meant there'd been four years of war at school and the last year well, it ended in er nineteen eighteen, the war did, so only the last year , but it was full of patriotism and all the old scholars that had er served or suffered or been killed, their names were up. Yes, we were very, very patriotic and er I'm not ashamed of it. Er I have a love of country, I know I'm er English, I don't like to say I'm British, I live and was born in England. And when I go to Wales for a holiday and there are Welshmen, they're just as good as I am, some can sing so much nicer, and I've worked with Scotsmen in engineering factories, and there's no better engineers than Scotsmen, but they don't necessarily call them British. Everywhere I've been, He's a Scottie. Or he's a p er Irishmen can be a Paddy and so on. And so I er never went the whole hog that way with thumping the British , British and best and so on. It could be and sometimes was, but i er the standard takes a lot of keeping up and er Much of the influence comes from newspaper and superior people implanting it on the population by reiterating these standards which often are wishful and they would like it to be so, but er They were hard days, they were hungry days. I was growing, but I'm now, I never got much higher than about five foot one and I weighed eight stone for a many years. But I was a little person in er a commu community of little person and er my brothers worked down the pit and I believe it was an advantage not to be much greater than five foot in height down the pits. It was the time of wooden pit props and er much kneeling and laying down and hacking away at the coal with picks and there was no mining machinery as we know it now. Could I? Could I just move you on a little bit? Having having talked about about your schooling to er . ask you about er family life and the impression that left upon on as you were growing up? W w what can you remember of your father? W w w what job did he have? And what kind of man was he ? Yes. My father worked on the railway and in my conscious life he was a supervisor, he was called an inspector, Inspector . He had two foremans worked under him, the purpose being they did the shifts, my father did all the writing for the Great Central Railway Depot, the marshalling yard or sorting out the trains. Strange to say, these trains do not come from other towns, say Birmingham, with er a trainload of stuff for Nottingham, they come with a trainload of stuff for here there and everywhere. And the person who had sorted it together at Birmingham made sure that the next stop it was at, the waggons would be at the back end to leave in that town and this is what my father was doing by er er shunting as it was called, or making a train up to go from Nottingham to London, or some other place in the country, with up to fifty or sixty trucks behind it and they didn't want the trucks next to the engine to be dropped off at the first place and having to shove and push about in their marshalling yard. It seemed a simple system when I got to know it, but wondered what it was all about, with chaps standing in different places and shouting and bawling where they wanted this waggon that was being pushed off, as he came running without the train they diverted it into siding, you see, sorting out a train. And it's not everybody's job to do that, so ordinary people took the jobs as shunters and could be taught how to do it in short time, if they were average and er in good health. Cos it's an outdoor job, it's a three shift system for those on the bottom, er early, morning and late, cos the eight hour day had come in at this time. Which would whe around when? When are we talking about now? Say about n nineteen? In the early nineteen twenties. We'd er Twenties. Yeah. er s er but those occupations that worked shift and had to go round the clock had to have eight hour shifts, three shifts. You could have earlies, lates and nights, which many people don't know, and I worked earlies, lates and night in engineering. Earlies er when I worked at the Ford Motor Company it meant getting from Ilford to Dagenham and starting on a machine at six A M in the morning, in the middle of winter or the middle of summer. And the next fortnight I would be on the afternoon shift, which meant getting the same distance, to half past two to work till They were eight hour shifts you see and the night shift likewise had to come a very er a tremendous number from working at the Ford Motor Company at Dagenham ev even in those days, travel from various places. And it's not all honey, starting somewhere at six in the morning if you live eight or nine miles off. There were not the multitude of motorcars about in those days, as there are now, but that was one of the firms that was trying to make it,and has done it, like that. So workmen have very irksome hours of work, unsocial hours I think they call them now, one of the most unsocial is the night shift. I've never been in any factory in my life, working nights, I have been in many, but I've never found my fellow men very sociable on the night shift. Actually you go there to work, but there is er a meal break and various things, you have contact with each other, either borrowing tools or sharing the use of them, but tempers get very short in the small hours of the morning and men get pretty tired. They can be It's no comparison with day work. Okay. Just to t to come back to what prompted you to to give us that interesting er little evaluation of the the differences that night and day work have men night and days to get get back to the beginning, to get back to your father? Yes. Erm y i i is it growing up ? Yes. On the railway. Yeah. Erm Well, I find, and still find, the clerical people are remote from reality. They they would think that a man er starting at eight in the morning will do as many and as quick for ten o'clock, as a man starting at night, or at six o'clock in the morning, or the afternoon shift. But it's not so. There's different tempos and I would think er on all the shifts there is a variation of production just because of the hour of the day. It is not natural to work through the night shift, I've worked it, there is no way of starting a week without your Er I've slept a night before, somewhere at the weekend, when the day comes, but you've got to go the next night to work. Even as a young person me mother used to say You'll need some sleep, you go to bed this afternoon, which I did, in obedience. But you know sleep escapes a young person, if one's in their young twenties and they think you can go to bed at er half past two in the afternoon and have an hour or two. It's not on. Er nowadays I've no trouble in dropping asleep in the afternoon No. but in the twenties I was better at the pictures or somewhere like that, which you could get for a few pence, but you're not walking about or doing tiring thing. Could I ask you then, when when you? When when was your first job? When did you leave school? And did you know what you were going to do when you left school? Well, my mother I left school and me mother said, the Labour Exchanges had come into being, er this was nineteen nineteen, they were in existence in Nottingham. And they had addresses and I ran around, I went to get a job at the pit, which er I had no more sense so I'm glad now that I didn't get on. And I found months and months after that most of the boys that got on there had their fathers work there, who went to the office, or asked the Butties, they used to talk about Butties in the pit, and I found this was short for deputy. Not er the th The employer deputized his authority and there was deputies in the pit, but never in factories. They have foremen, under-foremen, charge hands and so on, but in the pit they deputies down there. And er You passed up the chance to go the pit then? Yes. Inside a month, I was sent to an engineering place which was er close to where I live and I started there inside about a month. Can you remember the name of it?place ? It was the John and a very big factory in it's day, in as much as it was er four storeys high, rather high in those days for heavy machinery to be on level like that. And with the war ending the the Germans had had to pay reparations and that factory and many more were extremely busy because they were making lace machines for France. France was devastated and er they had always had a lace trade but we found in after years, this is a point that shouldn't be missed, that destruction by the Germans and the replacing under reparations, I understood the money came from, anyway the firm worked day and night for years, er left Nottingham the lace centre with the old pre-war machines and France and areas, including Italy, er with the modern machines. Even in villages, I known men who've worked abroad fitting them up in in er Germany and in France and in Italy, one of whom went to night school in Germany to learn the language t to get on better, he was there to receive machines. They're very big, like printing machines are . Yeah. Yeah. So i it was a thriving and booming factory because of this supply of machines through It was a working day and night and the er just as busy as the . wartime until, oh before, say, four years. And then much of this leeway was made up and the capacity being there er, well the hours of work were getting tackled then, they'd been longer hours and er I think as a a boy coming out of apprenticeship, er the forty seven hour week had come into being. Did you take an apprenticeship then? Yes. Yeah. I was apprenticed Yeah. and er worked till I was twenty one and you usually got the sack when you were twenty one, unless they were busy, very busy, they would say, You er, you won't get the full money at twenty one because er w I can get a man of forty one for that money. Th there's a t three a two year period where you'll be an improver, where you could have an increase in pay about every six months, bringing you up gradually. But should go to another factory and er hold your own in the factory you could expect to get the full money, which I did at twenty one. I went to Newark and got a job at , a ball bearing factory, and er they paid me the handsome wage of er two pounds sixteen for forty seven hours. It came to about one and three halfpence an hour. You have to allow the coins changed now, the three halfpence is not comparable with the present pence. But it was very low. Yeah. You wouldn't ten shillings for a day. Or it would be approximately ten shillings for a day because we had to work Saturday morning, although it was at Newark and got to travel twenty Yeah. miles there and twenty miles back. We Was it apparent to you at the time that the wage was low? Well to me it was a first time and being an unmarried man that I'd earned anything like it. It was the men there who were aggrieved, who had had better wages as the war had ended and there was such a rush on, wages had gone up, but the once the boom was got over they came down. And by er nineteen twenty six the engineers suffered a calamitous drop from about er four pound odd down to this two pound sixteen. Newark, by the way, was less than Nottingham because it was a country district. Nottingham considered to be more of engineering, not quite metropolitan, but varied trades and factories Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. and commanded a little bit more. Yeah. Was it was it difficult then to to to to have to have got a job in Nottingham, you had to go to Newark because it was w work wasn't as ava as as er As I said the er lace trade available in ? had er B building lace machines had er had it, in the term, and they started to diversify into a variation of the hosiery, which was quite another speciality. There were other places in Nottingham that had made nothing but hosiery machines and weren't quite as good as were at making lace machines. had a good reputation, although it was a non-union firm and n much maligned by er union people who disliked stand for not er sort of recognizing. You could work there being in a trade union but didn't have to say so. Yeah. See? It was kept small. But they made machines that did lace curtains, lace er is er a variant now, and er probably a thing of the past, but there was amazing things done on a lace machine. There's some in Nottingham, in one of the mus museum, that has the Nottingham coat of arms, I think it has the council house and various things, and it's all done mechanically on a huge machine that er is a repetition in each bay It's probably thirty, forty foot long, but in each bay of about seven foot it's separate curtain. But that machine can be doing, say eight curtains, coming off a bottom roller, being woven over and onto another one, till they're taken off. Endlessly, this pattern repeated endlessly, and the man could walk along and they'd all be working, he just goes with an assistant to er repair broken threads. They get broken, or the end of the line and so on, to join up you get a little blemish there which a repairer will do. So they they're pretty accurate er machines in a a pattern way, not a I found later in engineering where they needed things to the micrometer and the very, very fine measurement, very particular to the th the tissue paper difference between er er one thing and another wasn't good enough. It had got to be as near as thi thinness of tissue paper. We have feelers, metal strips, that are one and a half thou thick, we call it, you can't have them any thinner because they can make them in Sheffield at one thou thick but they suffer and bend by use. If you try to push them under a place to see if it's touching, you'll find they get bent up and once there's a bend in you can't smooth it. So the standard feelers for an engineer goes from about one and a half thou up to fifteen thou, the rest you can measure by other things. These are feelers. Y Yeah. You mentioned er earlier the trade unions and er you mentioned the the er middle twent middle nineteen twenties as a period of industrial un un un unrest. Yeah. W When when did you first join a trade-union yourself and get involved? When I er er were in the tool room at , Newark at the age of twenty one plus, you see, not twenty two er I was approached then by a shop steward who worked on the bench, was a fitter. I was always on a machine, cutting, milling machine. And I joined the the engineer's union, one Saturday night in Newark, had to go back there and they had meetings in the townhall, a room that was hired and er was er particulars taken and I've been in ever since. I'm still in the union, from nineteen twenty six to nineteen eighty three and next Monday I shall go to the branch cos I have an interest in the organization and the movement. I can't say it's been marvellously successful but I do know for a fact that the conditions of the working class was improved tremendously by organizations in the thing which has come to be described as trade-unionism. Er, there are abuses in some and variations and er not always a desire by everyone to belong to it, but the odd man out is often like a bad apple in a barrel. And er it's strange to me how an employer would be happy to have a room with a hundred and hope to get one or two who weren't, either for reasons of information or things that one couldn't trust from a worker. They are not in company in factories, there's antagonism between management and the shop floor. There is also the difference between employees who are in offices, who for some reason or other, I've always found and still do, they seem to have a notion that they're a different class to others who work for wages. They will talk about salaries and things like that but they're often paid, well, very remotely some of them, monthly now, and think that's er heavenly or something. But mostly, in my experience, they were paid just the same as we do we were, perhaps on a different day and a different method. We had to stand in a line. I've been to Newark on a Friday night and stood in a line with others on a night shift at a w wooden hut in the yard whilst a clerk from the pay office came to meet us, the day shift finishing at er, say five o'clock. He'd come half past seven to eight to pay us as we came to work, to hand us the money we'd earnt for the last week, always keeping about three days in hand. So employers, in my experience, even to the day I left, always owe the workman something for what he's done Mm. and it would appear in the simple times, before mine, even I had experience at Newark, that men could get a sub in the week because you're actually in two days you've actually earnt two days money and you haven't got it. And if a yarn was spun, or a general true story that a man had to have his train fare to get to Newark and he had to pay this and that, you could er get a loan on your wages. But you had to have qualified for it by working, see?end of the week and the only place I ever had one was at and because the foreman approached me, I'd been out of work and got the job by writing to it, going to the library and it was in one of the London papers, they wanted men for the tool rooms. I got to be working where they made the tools in that of the engineering shop and er I travelled on a Sunday from Nottingham to London and What year would this be? Just to put it into context ? Yes . Yes. Well, I'd be er I'd got er a daughter, nineteen twenty nine, I would say, nineteen twenty eight . Twenty nine, yes. I'd er at been at Newark till then for about four years or so and the er slump had come about and they were sacked by the hundreds, including myself. I asked the under-foreman what I'd done to deserve this, he says You're not on your own, there's er a quarter to go not having any new members? beg to differ Because,because I I do feel sorry, I I sorry I consider it for not having any young new members. But I do feel I do feel that er he will be, he will be assisted by having close people to clarify his thoughts for the council members. Now erm if he had any as somebody says, well no I think he has some thought er simply Might not be the correct ones. Simply confused. Erm, I think the charge that has been laid against myself personally and my myself and my colleagues is the charge of vacillation and changing our mind and I and I am grateful to c my colleague David for reminding us that we have in this county had two years two years when the Labour party and the Conservative party have been hand in glove, absolutely determined that the way forward in relation to homes, elderly persons homes, not that's not to close any and now we've had a complete volte face when they've changed their minds and they've come along with us. How interesting. Mr has also asked me whether it is true that if I can't get what I want second best will do. I think the argument should be put slightly differently. Would you prefer to have nothing rather than something? Because for two years for two years the intentions of the Conservative group, which have been the intentions of ourselves have delivered on the Moat Highfield questions, delivered nothing. That is the reality of what er Mike said and I'm sorry he pinched my line politics is the art of the possible and that is a message I'm afraid that the Conservatives on this council have never adopted. time and time again they sit on the sidelines saying this is what we think don't talk to us about it don't debate it, don't ask us to think about it, take it or leave it, if you don't give us what we want we'll sit back and moan and sulk and they've played, I think that's a very irresponsible line they've played in the five years I've been on this council and I hope that er again the issue on the next item on the agenda represents a change of heart on their behalf. of course goes on about what he always goes on about and er I would remind him that the supplementary estimates which is in the amendment here, is also in the amended motion which is proposed by the Conservatives and had all party support on every committee that it's come to. Finally I I would say that to erm Mike I think the amendment that is now before us which we are supporting goes considerably further than the original federative option. And has a combined budget which is in my view, the important thing that I believe was necessary in the life of the economic circumstances . That combined budget will inevitably involve a redistribution of resources you are going to live up to what you are now putting your name to. I don't think that Mr remarks were helpful. Because I don't think the question of what's going on outside Moat Centre today or yesterday or the day after, has a lot to do with the actual alternatives that we've been . What it does have a lot to do with is that the Moat Centre has not had clear significant management on the ground and what we're proposing here today should produce that in the very near future and what the proposals that Mr proposals would have done is not produced that in the significant future and I think that's the point that really needs to be stressed. Thank you. Mr It's not my day really earlier today I had to admit to being grateful to John Gummer now I'm gonna have to be. I know it's terrible isn't it I never thought I'd say that. Now I'm gonna have to say I'm gonna be grateful to Mr it's a really bad day. No I am grateful to Mr because he's finally crystallised in my mind something that's been bugging me the longer I stay on this council about exactly what the Tories see their role here as and it's now very clear to me, more than ever and that is that if you want to be obstructive and negative and if you go on long enough being obstructive and negative what you can end up doing is that you'll find yourself eventually in a position going on long enough that you can make totally meaningless speeches but at least you'll get nice headlines in the paper and that seems to me the whole essence of the Tory strategy. When my colleague to my right here, Roger and myself put forward a motion at last council on this issue ably led by our glorious leader to my left I would like to say that we've set up. Now what I would like to say is that we've made clear that we're with certain very clear objectives in pushing forward, in saying that certain things had to be achieved and when I read the lilac piece of paper or whatever colour we want to call it. I see a set of conclusions that achieve almost everything that was demanded at that time and I am grateful to everybody concerned who's actually sat down and actually really thought about what we're trying to do and everybody has made some compromise here and I shall certainly support this amendment and I shall make the compromise because the one thing in here that I thought was necessary that isn't there is the statement that there will be a head of centre and having actually worked in a project, head of sorry, head of project and having actually worked in a situation where I was a joint manager erm in the long run I think people will see the the wisdom of of a single head of project. But that's up fo that's up to people experience t t t t to conclude. But the main there 'ere is, we haven't actually changed our position we have actually stated clearly that we wanted to achieve something, we wanted to make sure that what was being provided in that community was the best best thing possible within the resources available and that things developed on This amendment takes us that way forward and we are at least being clear to our principles rather than just being negatively obstructive. Mr Thanks Chair. I just like to start off by saying and just reminding the council well in particular Mr in light of what he said that he doesn't understand what Mr is on about, well he's never understood the issue of the merger in Highfields. Mr has made more publicity on this issue than any other councillor. I think there's no issue in his patch that he might want to talk about. But he's made national headlines local and every other headlines that comes about regarding this issue of the merger. But I think in seconding this motion I think it's a way forward and I think it's better late than never I think what it talks about that we would not be here today Mr Chairman if this would have been agreed by what was put by the officers two and half years ago. It's not a federated system, it actually, positively talks about moving forward as Professor states it in the economical situation the council is in. It talks about one budget covering for the two centres and it also talks about two heads of centres which is more practicable and more rational than any other s situation that would have been if the merger decision would have stayed. There has never been an argument put by anyone to convince myself or people who have protested against the merger, a rational argument has never been put against what people have said that the merger is a rational way forward. I think it would have been a disaster and a recipe for disaster because practically if you know what the situation is in the Moat Centre and the Highfields youth and community centre then people would have never resisted to that change. I'm not saying that people would have never changed their ideas but if it would have been done in the manner that it would have been done in in the first place and if people would have been told about their future lives and if people had been, would've accepted what was going on in light of all the decisions that have been taken previously regarding the merger issue. I think these proposals not only are a way forward but also in light of what is actually happening in the area of Highfields with er the high numbers of unemployment, with the high rate of people underachieving in education I think for the last two and a half years there has been no clear guidelines or structure that has systematically brought about any results in the two centres to move forward where people have lost out by this issue being bureaucratic and a political football that's being kicked about and I think it's about time where we now have cross party consensus that we move positively forward and work towards these proposals. I mean in so I I come here today with a petition that I presented that also talks about proposing to abolish the merger, I mean this is a move just one step away from that but I still feel in what was proposed at the last full council meeting and I would express my views to the officers that in light of what has been suggested today is actually implemented to the wording as it stands because the joint working party that had been er written up previously never did meet although if I can inform it was only the officers who actually met up and I hope that in light of all the working group and the two heads of centres covering for each other would be implicitly applied. In light of er Near time all the consultation that also talks about in this paper is met with the two centres, the management committee of Highfields youth and commune centre and also the users of the Moat Centre and I think in light of everything that's gone on I think it's substantially a success to stand here and say that we have at least achieved some result and I I formally would welcome the Libs supporting this this afternoon and I'm grateful for the turn that the Libs have made and in light of er what er Mr the involvement Mr has put in. Time time time now please. Thank you. Thanks Chair. Mr do you wish the right of reply. No it's Mr Mr Not really Chair . I'm mean we've discussed it often but I I would be grateful if we could It's Mr I'd hate to stop Mr in full cry Okay then chairman I I would er recommend that we support the amendment moved by Mr . Right, those in favour. Right erm yeah look at the congress. Just wanna wrap this up now erm by bringing in the erm example of Greece. Er the er er Greek revolt. Erm just to recap on that slightly. It started round about eighteen twenty one although actually there there'd been erm er simmering discontent in the amongst the Christians in the Balkan area for some time. We we needn't worry too much that thought but erm the Greek revolt itself in eighteen twenty to one to round about eighteen twenty five had gone on without any European intervention. To some extent this was due to the influence of the er of of . Erm who was able to hold er the Russians back from intervening on the grounds that it would be er seen as intervention in a er in in in a revolt. Erm the revolt is of course essentially a nationalist revolt. I suppose there are liberal overtones in it but it's essentially a nationalist revolt. After eighteen twenty five of course erm the death of Alexandria especially of Nicholas Russia is more inclined to intervene especially as the Greek rebels are being defeated because of the mention the intervention of of erm Turkey's ally erm er Egypt Egypt a a a a problem for the Turkish empire . The ruler of Egypt Mohammed Ali intervened in the revolt on behalf of Turkey with the promise of territory in the area. Erm and the revolt begins to er er er crumble. Erm so Russia decides to intervene and at this point erm is especially concern of Britain. And the upshot is that in eighteen twenty six Britain suggests in essence holding a congress to discuss the er er Greek revolt. Erm Britain and France are very concerned about the prospect of Russian intervention. Erm And in essence a kind of congress is held at St Petersburg. It's not trotted out in the old history books as one of the conferences, or one of the congresses rather. In fact it's, it's more often referred to correctly as a conference. Erm it consisted of the ambassadors of the great, of the, of of the great powers erm er meeting together at St Petersburg. Erm it's there's a certain irony about all this. As we know erm Canning had to a great extent welcomed the end of the congress system. His famous comment about things are back to as they should be every nation for herself and god for us all. Erm but in twenty six he in a sense does a U turn. And he's concerned to get great power co-operation to solve the Greek er er problem. The other irony is of course that up until at the previous congresses like Verona erm Britain hadn't attended. At this one Austria doesn't attend. And same, well and and Prussia as well for that matter but they're not so, so important. At this conference the great powers involved are Britain, Russia and France. Of course the other irony as well is that the powers that meet at the conference at St Petersburg er the powers decide they will intervene in Greece. And they're intervening of course here on the side of a revolt which is going against the grain of erm of certainly for Russia of course of er of of the attitudes of the eighteen erm er eighteen teens early eighteen twenties. The idea was basically to produce some kind of semi-independent Greece. Er of course as we know or we might, some of us might know from er Brit. his. that erm from British History that erm in eighteen er erm the Turks refused to co-operate in this. And erm in when was it eighteen twenty seven at the Battle of Navareno the British navy sunk the Turkish fleet. Erm thus to a great extent erm ending the erm er the prospects of Turkish success. What what was that battle again? Navareno. Navar Avokea or Navareno Bay erm it's more, I think it's more technically known as Avokea See if they've got a reference to the . Oops. Oh no it is Nav I'm I'm sorry. I'm confused aren't I? It is Navareno. Yeah erm again you needn't worry too much about the er erm about the ramifications of this Kenning died in twenty seven and Britain to some extent disentangled herself from the Greek revolt but the upshot was that in eighteen thirty Greece became an independent state. Her independence guaranteed by Britain, Russia and France. Okay erm I suppose we ought to mention in this context as well er Belgium. I'll probably refer to it again later on . Er in Belgium of course in eighteen thirty erm a nationalist revolt broke out in response really to the French revolution of that year. Which we'll be looking at briefly in a sec. Erm this was a direct challenge to the Vienna settlement of course. As we know at the Vienna settlement, Belgium was put under er er er er essentially under Dutch rule. Erm Britain and France were prepared to defend Belgian independence. The other powers were er at odds with Britain and France ie Austria, Russia Prussia. So again we see a split in the er in in in amongst the great powers. What? I just It's Britain and France were prepared to support Belgian independence. Erm Russia, Prussia Austria not. And we are seeing in eighteen thirty a significant gap between on the one hand erm the western powers and on the other hand the east european or the central and eastern european powers. In eighteen thirty of course, the east european powers were unable erm er to intervene. Er Russia had erm a revolt in Poland to face. Austria faced disturbances in Italy. Prussia of course couldn't really act by herself. But we are seeing a widening gap. And indeed erm in the eighteen thirties we see the formation in the west of the so called quadruple alliance not to be confused with the great quadruple alliance of eighteen er thirteen. The quadruple alliance consisted of Britain, France, Spain and Portugal which had by now got sort of liberal constitutional governments. Well it's erm it's erm it's about, I think it's about eighteen thirty three thirty four. Doesn't really matter. It's the earliest, er early eighteen thirties. And on the other hand, Austria, Russia and er Prussia it's Munchengratz isn't it. forgetting me er me Munchen Yep. In fact they may even have a date for you here. Yeah eighteen thirty three Munchengratz. It's an agreement to defend each other against the threat of revolution. Yep. Erm So we are seeing by er the early eighteen thirties something of a formalized split between the er er the powers of er the quadruple and then the er quintsimple erm er alliance. I'm referring obviously to the quadruple alliance of eighteen er er fifteen. Okay perhaps we can er er wrap a few things up on the erm on the er Vienna er settlement and the congress system itself. What actually happened in Belgium? Belgium became independent. Sorry yeah. Belgium became independent. Erm it's ind , it's independence was recognized fully by all the major European powers by eighteen thirty nine. It was regarded as erm it was one of Palmerston's, one of Palmerston's great triumphs wasn't it? Isn't it the case that Palmerston when he was on his death bed had the clause to the Belgian treaty read to him to cheer him up. Okay erm let's perhaps make a few comments then about the Vienna settlement itself. The old er the old kind of chestnut question is was it a success or a failure? I I I'd say with the, with the revamped exam you're not likely, you're not likely to get a question like that. Was Vienna successful? But you're gonna get a much wider question if it comes up on this and erm perhaps in incorporating the congress system but let's approach it from that, that perspective anyway. I think the best way of looking at this is to kind of take an open-ended version of what the Vienna settlement is all about. Er not just the treaty in eighteen fifteen but the whole congress system erm after eighteen fifteen onwards and into the eighteen twenties and such like. Erm I suppose the er the classic interpretation of the er the Vienna settlements is that erm in in the nineteenth century was that it was a failure and there was a, there was a kind of er consensus beginning quite early actually. There's a kind of consensus view that in the language of ten sixty six and all that the Vienna settlement was a bad thing. Erm and I say this view is, is in some respects being er erm er expressed relatively early on. Erm and you even get it associated with leading rulers or states er statesmen of the day. For instance erm somebody like Napoleon the Third. He emerged as president of France as Prince Louis Napoleon in eighteen forty eight and he er he erm achieves power by coup d'etat and becomes emperor in eighteen fifty two. Napoleon the Third is someone who's er who sees it as one of his objectives to undo the Vienna settlement. Erm and you've got other leading figures of the day. Count Cavor prime minister of Piedmont in eighteen er fifty. Erm and someone who's described as perhaps one of the architects of Italian unity. He becomes the prime minister of of a relatively united Italy erm in eighteen er eighteen sixty. Cavor is someone who's er Right. Cavor is someone who's hostile er to the Vienna settlement. Let alone of course large numbers of liberal stroke nationalist erm revolutionaries within Europe in the eighteen er twenties, thirties and forties. The various national secret societies and various nationalist movements like er Young Italy and there's even one called Young Europe which is kind of a pretty, pretty much catch-all one. But the various nationalist societies or the revolutionary purpose. They're all hostile to the Vienna settlement. And that perhaps er having mentioned the nationalist erm societies this perhaps gives us a clue to it. The the view was taken that the Vienna settlement was hostile to liberalism and nationalism. That was the view taken that the Vienna settlement was hostile to liberalism. It was hostile to nationalism. And therefore it was wrong because the argument goes that liberalism and nationalism are the great triumphant er ideologies of the nineteenth century and the Vienna settlement's not only wrong, but it was historically erm in a sense doomed because it was trying to oppose the growing erm unstoppable er ideologies of er erm of er of Europe. By the way erm it's always rather amusing when you see in the old history books the er the idea that erm that, to give an example, somebody like Metternich. You get the old idea that Metternich ignored liberalism and nationalism. Erm that's a very, a very misleading way of putting it. Metternich in many ways thought of little else except liberalism and nationalism. The Vienna settlement didn't ignore liberalism and nationalism. It tried its best to clobber it. It tried its best to actually er suppress it. And don't forget erm perhaps we ought to say a word on the er on the conservative's side here. Erm don't forget it's people like Metternich and indeed Castlereagh and the other erm er figures at the Vienna settlement. They were looking back in eighteen fifteen at twenty odd years of war and revolution. And if that was you know you could, I supp , you could argue that the French revolution had been built on notions of liberalism and it had encouraged nationalism in Europe. And therefore you could associate liberalism and nationalism with war, terror erm and perhaps therefore it wasn't all that desirable. Obviously as well in Metternich's er er, in Metternich's case nationalism would be the end of the Austrian empire. Because the Austrian empire, the Habsburg empire was a conglomeration of large numbers of different nationalities. Nationalism affected other great powers as well. Erm Russia Russia in eighteen fifteen grabbed Poland. Prussia had, still had chunks of Polish territory little bits of it. Prussia of course more especially more especially Prussia feared a united Germany. If you brought, if you got a united Germany then Prussia would simply be a small part of that united Germany. So it's important to note that nationalism the prospect of nationalism was seen as undesirable by the er major European powers. It didn't nationalism had no erm wouldn't affect France as such. Didn't affect Britain. Well it affected Ireland. There was always the problem of Ireland. I think it's a bit wrong perhaps to say it didn't affect Britain. Perhaps it didn't affect Britain at this time. But as we know from British history one of the understated reasons why erm there was a lot of hostility to home rule for Ireland in Britain was because of the fear of the creation of a hostile state er erm off, off Britain's shore. Erm so that's one aspect of Vienna. It was seen as being opposed to liberalism, as opposed to nationalism and perhaps there were, there were er, there were, there were good reasons er for that. By the way erm are we relatively clear what's meant by liberalism and nationalism within this context? Should I perhaps digress and say a little word erm er about this? Perhaps I will. It's perhaps of some interest to us that erm these to great -isms, liberalism and nationalism I think we can see them as products of the French revolution. Or indeed products of perhaps enlightened attitudes, certainly with the case of liberalism. In a sense, if we think of the context of say the late eighteenth early nineteenth century perhaps more, perhaps more specifically we think of the er, of the er erm early nineteenth century. Liberalism and nationalism are seen as two sides of the same coin. They were seen as inextricably bound up. Erm all liberals were nationalists. And to er, I suppose by and large, vice versa as well. Erm as I've said the er the the two er known as the two -isms. The two ideologies are by and large products of the revolution or in the case of liberalism perhaps of the of enlightened attitudes. By liberalism liberalism meant a number of things. It meant primarily constitutional government. It meant primarily constitutional government. Written constitutional government. Liberalism. Oh. It meant by and large constitut , it meant, it meant primarily rather constitutional government. Liberals would look to for instance the con the United States' Constitution. They would look to the er er to the constitution of of of France in say seventeen ninety one or the more radicals amongst them would look erm the more er the more radical liberal if that's not er, if that's not a, not a contradiction in terms, don't think it is. They would look to the constitution of eighteen, of seventeen ninety three. Others, other in nineteenth century Europe looked to the constitutions granted in eighteen twelve for instance in Spain and in Naples. These aren't er er er they tend to be a bit ignored in history, these. But they're of interest. In eighteen, in in late eighteen twelve erm with the prospect perhaps of Napoleonic rule in difficulties you see in some of Napoleon's, some of the client states of Napoleonic Europe Spain, Naples you see constitutions being granted which are are pretty democratic actually. And th the they're looked to by er European liberals as as model constitutions. When you get a revolt in Spain in the eighteen twenties. What is the revolt in favour of? The revolt is in favour of the constitution of eighteen twelve. So they believe in constitutional governments. Erm now obviously in the context of constitutional governments it's not, one can imagine having a constitutional form of government without, without a parliamentary system but erm it's perhaps a bit of a stretch of the imagination. But they mean by, erm constitutional government they also er er liberals also believed in the notion of parliamentary government. It's very much connected to late enlightenment notions that the only valid government would be representative government. Other forms of government are in a sense illegitimate. Absolute rule. Monarchical rule. Well not necessarily, I mean, unless the monarch was was was er, was part of the constitutional set up. But representative government was the only really legitimate form of government. Of course, there was debate amongst liberals on how much representation there would be. Or to put it, erm erm erm more simplistically how, how many people would have the vote. Erm we see this within the context of the reform movement in Britain after eighteen fifteen. Where you've got reformers ranging from those who want the household suffrage er household suffrage. A vote to all householders. Across to those who wanted erm erm a universal male suffrage. Erm one man one vote. Erm European liberalism is based upon, is based upon context as well of secularism. Or to perhaps er put it more to put it, to make it more erm obvious anti-clericalism. This didn't necessarily mean hostility to religion as such. But the notion of secularism, the notion of anti-clericalism meant that within the liberal states erm the er er there would be a separation of church and state. Erm the church would have no role within the state as being say in a erm erm in other words there would be erm the catholic church in in erm in say er a state like France er should not be the established church. There would be a separation of church and state. And by and large the activities of church and state would be separatist. The church would play no role in the affairs of state. Erm Other notions erm of liberalism of course again which are perhaps pretty obvious freedom of speech and implied in that freedom of religion, freedom of expression, that kind of thing. But in essence they're the main er er the main aspects of er of of er what was meant by liberalism in the er in in er the nineteenth century. Erm it perhaps doesn't strike us as being very revolutionary but of course it depends from the context that you're in erm to perhaps some of the absolute rulers of er of er perhaps, this was revolutionary. Erm What about nationalism? Nationalism we perhaps some of the er er some of the erm concepts of nationalism appearing even before the French revolution. You begin to see er in erm in parts of Europe in the er later eighteenth century a growing emphasis upon er er upon language, literature of of certain areas. I'm thinking of Italy here primarily. Erm as it develops under the impact of the French revolution and Napoleonic rule and then later what nationalism came to be seen as it's the basically the idea that erm that people of a common culture history and language should occupy perhaps that's the wrong word. Er should er should have a separate state. Should not be ruled by a foreign power. So a people with a common culture, history, language should live in a separately defined state. And certainly should not live under the rule of a foreign er power. And our classic examples of course there erm of of of this situation in in post eighteen fifteen Europe are Germany, Italy Poland . Now I've I've suggested that erm in the early nineteenth century, liberalism and nationalism are very much bound up. Er all, all nationalists in a sense are liberals, or liberals are nationalists. One aspect of this of course, one reason er er behind this is is the French revolution. Let's not forget that erm under Napoleonic rule you do see the creation of a so-called king of Italy. It's northern Italy. Erm Napoleon happens to be it's king and and it is very much a client of France. We see the creation of of of the confederation of the Rhine. A a kind of erm united Germany. Erm within, in these states as well you,th the the nationalism of them, although it's in the French direction. It's associated as well with the ideology of Napoleonic France. Erm which does imply an attack on the old feudal regimes er er er previously existing. Erm so after eighteen fifteen there is this link between liberalism and nationalism. I don't wanna go much er er further ahead on this for the moment. We do tend to see liberalism and nationalism parting company. Especially after eighteen forty eight. And as ag I will, I'll be returning to this obviously in consideration of Italy and Germany, but it is perhaps worth making this point now. You do see liberalism and nationalism parting company. Erm and you do get this growing awareness that not all of that while all liberals might be nationalists. All right thinking liberals in Europe from Gladstone in England you know. All right thinking liberals support nationalist aspirations. Gladstone a great advocate of Italian unity for instance. Gladstone an advocate of er of of Balkan nationalism. He wanted Turkey out of the Balkan er er out of south eastern Europe. So all good European liberals are nationalists. It starts to become apparent, very very clear that not all nationalists are good liberals. In fact far from it. Erm if the choice is between securing er your er securing your own state. Securing the nationalist goal and ignoring the liberal goal, many nationalists will go for the nationalist goal. If the price of bringing about your united state is the dumping of liberals, then so be it. In that sense nationalism of course er it perhaps becomes a more dynamic and problematic ideology in nineteenth century Europe. So I I've digressed er from er considering what erm erm er what this has got to do with the er erm congress of Vienna but I think it's er hopefully er er a worthwhile erm er digression. Erm let me turn er briefly to the those who have something good to say about the Vienna settlement. It's had it's supporters er one is always reminded that one of it's key supporters, the former American er er secretary of state and and at the moment, globe-trotting world expert er Henry Kissinger. Kissinger erm who began life as a er er as professor of history. His first major work was a defence of the Vienna settlement. Erm and it it it, it has been defended on a number of grounds. It's been argued by it's supporters that it ushered in an era of peace. Erm At it's most extreme interpretation there's an argument that erm, that the Vienna settlement was a factor in maintaining peace in Europe between eighteen fifteen and nineteen fourteen. Because it's extreme supporters suggest that that it wasn't until nineteen fourteen that a war broke out involving all the great European powers. Erm one would argue that's er that's er, that's an extreme erm er view. Erm there are wars in Europe after eighteen fifteen. And some people might argue the Vienna settlement was a factor in bringing about some of these wars. So it's again, unfortunately it's it comes down in one of these erm pays your money takes your choice erm er arguments. But it is worth making the point that for instance if we take a look after eighteen fifteen of, at the wars. There's war between Russia and Turkey in er eighteen er thirty when Russia militarily intervenes in the Turkish revolt. Of course there's the war war between Russia and Turkey as well in the in in in the eighteen seventies. But for the moment I'm just looking perhaps nearer to the Vienna settlement itself. Erm there's war between er you get the Crimean war between Russia on the one hand and Great Britain and France on the other. And it's always worth remembering about the Crimean erm episode that Austria in essence intervenes on the side er er intervenes not so much on the side of Britain and France but against Russia. Austria played a decisive though non-military role in er in in the Vienna, in in, in the er in the Crimean war. Erm and then we have the so- called nationalist er wars. For instance eighteen sixty four between Denmark and Prussia and Austria. Technically Prussia and Austria here representing the German confederation. It's a war concerning the vexed and famous Schleswig-Holstein dispute of course which I'm sure we're all familiar with. The erm eighteen sixty six war between Prussia and Austria. These are, this is the war which essentially brings about German er unity under Prussian erm erm control. Prussia is the victor of course of this war. shock win for Prussia. Shock win for Prussia! What a kind of er foo sport's page headline isn't it, yeah? . If what you're suggesting is there was an expectation that Prussia might not win the war. Yeah. And given the fact don't forget, it's always worth remembering this and I've I've made, I'll be making the point later on. Most of the German states supported Prussia in the Austrian Prussian war. Including the states. Supported Austria sorry. Supported Austria. Not supported Prussia. I think . Now of course there are the wars for Italian erm er unification. Eighteen fifty nine. A war between Au between Austria on the one hand and France and technically Piedmont on the other. Although the Piedmontese army didn't arrive until the battles were over . There was war between on the one hand Austria and the other hand France and Piedmont. Erm and then of course in a sense almost bringing these things together the, the major and perhaps most influential of these er wars. The war between France what is normally referred to as the Franco-Prussian war. I suppose to be technical it ought to be the er it ought to be referred to as the Franco- German war. It ought to be a war between France and a united Germany. But as it is, it is primarily Prussia that's er involved. The war between France and Prussia. Eighteen seventy to seventy one. The argument is, is that okay these are, that certainly erm we see a number of wars in er nineteenth century Europe. But the argument is well they're not very big wars are they? They're they're short er wars. They range I mean er the the er the er Prussian Austro-Prussian war of eighteen sixty six is is referred to as what the six weeks war and and erm the five, five weeks of that or or or whatever were were involved in peace negotiations. The war itself was just three days. Erm there was only one battle in it you know but That erm that the war between France and erm and and and Austria was fought in June erm essentially in June of er of eighteen er fifty nine. They are short wars, the argument is. The same with the Dan Danish Austro. Danish war the wars in Denmark and Austria and Prussia one might imagine a rather short- lived er war. How long did it take ? Well not very long. I suppose it's erm in in that sense erm er I I I I can see what you're, this, I don't think that's a factor in in in the, in the erm in in the fact that these wars are short. I think these wars are short because they're fought for limited objectives. They don't tend to escalate. Because the, because only one or two of the powers are involved in them. Or three perhaps in in in in the Crimea. Erm Nevertheless, to some extent the wars reflect the breakdown of the Vienna settlement. So it's a kind of a strange argument to suggest on the one hand the Vienna settlement was a factor in in preventing wars between all the great , er major war involving all the great powers. Erm when at the same time the Vienna settlement appears to be crumbling like after er erm after eighteen thirty or something. Of course erm it's perhaps, perhaps it's looking slightly to the er historical future it it's er it it was bad news in one sense because erm there came to be a view taken in Europe that wars between the great powers would be short, sharp wars. And hence the feeling in nineteen fourteen when the first world war broke out that it would er all be over by Christmas. Because it, cos people were you know erm as is often said generally of of a of a general staffs of armies. They're always fighting the previous war. There was this view that the first world war would be rather like a re-run of some of these wars at the end of the nineteenth century. Erm which didn't turn out to be the case. Erm so I would say, I'll just wrap this up erm on on erm on on on this point the er by making by introducing the fact that some, some historians have argued that these wars were short. Okay they had limited objectives. They were correcting the Vienna settlement. That's in a way how you can perhaps square the circle. You can argue these wars were corrective. Erm And the other factor that that's introduced as well is that the powers got into the habit of meeting in congresses. And you do see erm in the nineteenth century erm the powers still meeting together. For instance at the end of the Crimean war in eighteen fifty six the peace treaty that's er er that's held is actually a congress. All the powers attended the eighteen fifty six treaty of Paris. It's not just a a peace treaty signed by it's not just, er it's not just a direct signing of a peace treaty between say France Britain, Russia. It turns into a congress. The congress of Berlin eighteen seventy eight. When it appears that there might be a major outbreak in erm in in in in south eastern Europe. The powers do perhaps get into the habit of erm of erm of meeting together. Okay anyway, we'll er leave it at that then for the moment. Chairman appointed to E I P and to the North Yorkshire number three. Can I say that the purpose of the E I P is to examine the various issues that have been id identified for discussion. And the panel's role is to report on those issues. Er we are not required or intending to look at objections which have been submitted on other aspects of the structure plan. We are simply concerned with those issues which we will be discussing over the next erm eight days or so. The er other aspect I think erm for the purpose of those who were not at the er pre meeting, is to introduce the other panel member, and that Miss Roz who is a senior inspector, with the planning inspectorate on my right. On my left is the panel secretary Mrs Clare . And of course you will already be aware of the er program office which is outside just off the corridor. Now can I get some of the mechanics out of the way first of all before we before I ask North Yorkshire to make a start with their presentation? Firstly, I presume that those who want lunch, sandwiches here have already er taken care of their order. I would also like to add that the small meeting room which is off the corridor, opposite the program office, is ava available for you to er relax during the lunch break, and eat your sandwiches in there, rather than bring them into the hall. The other thing I would like to make sure and this applies also to the members of the public as well as those people who are participating in the discussion, could you please make sure that you have registered for the day. Er you can do that during the coffee break if you haven't already done so. now some of you will also have seen a form being circulated, asking you to agree that the recordings that are being made of the discussions, can be used as part of a research project. Certainly I was asked about this er well before the er E I P er and we agreed that there w Well certainly I agreed that I could see nothing wrong with that since it is a cl closed research project, and nothing will be divulged at all er publicly. Apart from which of course, that everything we say is being held in public session in any event. The recordings are available for you if you wish or will be available for you if you wish to er improve your memory on what has been said during the discussion periods. I must add that we will not be producing daily summaries, er I think it's a task which is a fairly daunting on and quite frankly, er they will not be produced in the sense At the end That they would not be available at the end of each day. Erm as I say, the recordings will be available if you wish to refresh your memory. They will be held during the course of the E I P here, otherwise they will be help by the county council. Now I was about to make a comment that er well most of you know who who you are and where you're sitting, er those that have already done that have turned their name tags round so we can see. Er one or two others, I would welcome that. We can identify you more readily that way. In terms of progressing or taking part in the discussion, can I suggest that if you want to come in on a particular item, you put your name board up like that, so that we can readily observe it er and equally, our friend who is looking after the microphones can make sure that the vol the volume of your microphone is turned up at the appropriate time. I don't think you wish us to tamper with the microphones at all do you? No, fine. Now if I can move on to today's session, we are going to concer concerned ourself obviously with housing land applications and primarily with matter one A. But before before I ask North Yorkshire to introduce the matter, can I put H B F on notice that I would like them to follow on from North Yorkshire, when they have made their contribution. I would also like to say that er whilst we are going to talk about the housing allocations in the sort of strategic sense, across the county first of all, there are as you will remember er the matters of some disagreements, differences of opinion on demographic issues. I raised this at the pre-meeting and asked that the various participants should have a look at those issues where they had areas of disagreement to see whether or not er they could reconcile those. And I I would like that to be touched on as well. Er by North Yorkshire. I think s the differences in some cases ar are so large that it's inescapable er that we have a discussion on. The other thing, and this is a case of where the panel bites back as it were. We have laid on the table, two tables, P S O one and P S O two. Erm and what we have done in compiling these tables and this has been done by the panel secretary, is to take from the various submissions of the participants, the various housing figures, the the various projections of likely need, of the housing requirement and the effective summary really is in P S O one, but when you look at P S O two er there's a little more detailed work gone into that. Now could I ask, if there are any erm matters on there where you have found and error and it's an error of fact, can I just stress that at this stage? Erm could you let the panel secretary know er about that this mo sometime this morning, but certainly er in time for our start of the afternoon session. But we felt the tables themselves, could provide a useful background er and in having had them compiled, they point up some rather interesting issues, which we would return to eventually. Now if I can pass on and ask Mr from North Yorkshire, who first of all is going to give you an introduction which in effect which effectively will set the context of alteration number three. And then I presume Mr you'll go on to deal with matter A one A. Yes that's correct Mr , er it will be brief. Well ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of this examination in public, it would probably be helpful to all present and participating, if the county council explained why this alteration is necessary, and the relationship of its content to regional and national guidance. Well now in case anyone present is uncertain, erm of the geography of the county, there is a plan displayed er on the board er at the back of the room which w should help er in that circumstance. The county is the largest by area in England, it borders two conurbations to the North and South, it's unique environmentally, both in its natural and built form. having two national parks, two and half areas of outstanding natural beauty, a heritage coast and a wealth of historic towns er and villages. The county council believes that North Yorkshire, the character of it, er is a national asset, but there is a view that because the county is large and relatively sparsely populated, there should be almost what appears to be an open door policy for development. We for our part are unaware of any statement of national policy that requires sparsely populated counties to be earmarked for development. Well now, the starting position today is that the North Yorkshire County Structure Plan was approved by the Secretary of State in November nineteen eighty. Together with subsequent alterations in January nineteen eighty seven and August nineteen eighty nine. I think it's fair to say that the Secretary of State has accepted that the special character of North Yorkshire, require a balance to be struck between environmental protection and development in the county. And we consider that this approach enjoys widespread support in North Yorkshire. Now district councils and National Park committees have approach in pursuit of their own plan making activities and although statutory local planning coverage in the county is still incomplete, the planning process at both county and district level, generally aims to meet the Secretary of State's wishes for North Yorkshire. As during the examination in public into the first alteration, this E I P will demonstrate again the wide measure of agreement between county and district councils. And we for our part think that this counts for a lot. As to the reasons why this alteration is necessary, the county council thinks there are three reasons, The first is to reflect the wish of government that the development planning system er is up to date, second and more practically, to provide a context for district wide development plan, and third, the urgent need to resolve the future strategic planning direction of greater York. As far as up to date development plans is concerned, this is supported by all sections of the community and need not be dwelt upon. An appropriate conte for context for district wide plans is necessary because the approved structure plan only extends to nineteen ninety six. Quite clearly the time horizon needs to be extended to allow structure plan numeric policies to provide clear guidance, not least in respect of a supply of land for housing in the county. District councils are presently making good progress on the development plans and appro and an approved alteration is clearly essential for that process. Well now the third factor, Greater York, has probably been the single most important planning issue for the county council and the Greater York districts over the past ten years. The ingredients I think we well know. A greenbelt agreed in principle by the Secretary of State but yet to be defined statutorily, a general absence of consensus on where future development in Greater York should be located, and increasing intervention by the Secretary of State on planning applications in Greater York. The county council and the five Greater York district councils began to address the issue in nineteen eighty eight and have spent five years in moving toward this examination in public. That might seem like a long time, but the issues have clearly been complex, and have been progressed as quickly as possible not least through vigourous prodding by the D O E, keen to see approval of a long term development strategy for Greater York and more importantly, a statutory definition of the York gre greenbelt. Well we think that the D O E would probably be quite pleased with the position that we reached today. During the period since nineteen eighty eight, the Greater York authorities have agreed a long term development strategy involving a new settlement contribution. This enabled progress on a York greenbelt local plan which in April nineteen ninety three completed a seven month public enquiry. The county council further accepted that an alteration to the approved structure plan was necessary to legitimize the strategy as the approved structure plan made no provision for it. That has also been progressed as concurrently as possible with the greenbelt local plan. So here we are today, almost at the end of a very long process, having experienced a wide ranging debate about the future of Greater York and numerous consultation exercises. The E I P today is probably one of the last pieces in the jigsaw. The completion of which will at long last resolve strategic planning issues in Greater York. Well of course this process pr could just as easily have been progressed through a full scale review of the structure plan rather than an alteration. As far as a full scale review of the structure plan is concerned, there is no doubt in the county council's mind, that such a full scale review would have significantly extended the process when all the players wish to see rapid progress, particularly to deal with the problems of Greater York. In nineteen ninety, the county council did consider the merits of a full scale review as against an alteration. It accepted that while there were arguments for a full scale review, the priority had to progress on an alteration which as quickly as possible, established the principle of a Greater York new settlement and progress on the greenbelt local plan. This approach was supported by the regional office of the Department of the environment. It is an alteration therefore that is t to be debated at this E I P and its coverage is relatively straightforward, though its content controversial. Policy H one provides the numeric provision for dwellings in the county after two thousand and six. Policy H two is a new policy which makes provision for a new settlement to help meet the development needs of the Greater York area. Policies I five and I twelve provide for land for employment in the period up to two thousand and six, while in the T policies, the opportunity is taken to update road schemes in the county. Finally, with the support of our district council, the dis the county council seeks to correct a serious omission of strategic planning policies for North Yorkshire, the inclusion of policy E two of a policy to control development in the countryside. All the policies have been the subject of consultation, but in the case of policy H two, we've experienced almost five years of continued discussion and debate first of all through the Greater York study and then through this alteration. The county council believes that policy H two is essential for the future of the Greater York area. The policy even has the distinction of attracting from the regional office of the Department of the Environment, in the paper to be considered at this E I P, a phrase of mild support. All these efforts do need of course to be assessed against their compliance or otherwise with national and regional guidance. The former in large part embodied in P P G, the latter in regional planning guidance for York and Humberside, yet to be issued by the Secretary of State. As far as the former is concerned, planning policy guidance, we will have different views. Certainly this alteration will ensure the strategic policy in North Yorkshire is up to date. And the alteration will address issues clearly appropria appropriate to structure plans. The the policies will be much debated, with quotes from various P P Gs, probably selective, being used by both the county council and objectors to justify their position. In any event, P P Gs are carefully drafted to ensure that few options are closed off. The county council does feel comfortable about the compliance of its alteration with national planning guidance. As far as regional planning guidance is concerned, there is none. It's quite clear, the needs of sensible planning require progress on development plans. nowhere has this been more evident than in Greater York. While P P G twelve provides for a cascade of planning policy, I suggest that only a purist would delay a resolution of the needs of Greater York, through the development plan process, in order to await regional planning guidance. In any event, the draft regional advice which has recently been the subject of consultation, does not conflict with this alteration, though Leeds and Bradford have reservations on the level of housing provision in North Yorkshire. We think the Secretary of State's present wish for ordered planning will benefit from the discussions at this E I P. There are I suspect, few organizations represented around this table, public or private, that would wish a delay in decision. Finally panel, the county council considers that the issues raised in this alteration require early decision and not in two or three years time. It is the county council's responsibility to bring forward proposals to enable progress to be made. The county council has taken those decisions and we think they ought to be debated vigorously and following that discussion, the panel will come to its conclusion. The county council therefore commends this alteration to the panel. That's all I would like to say . You don't wish to pursue in slightly more detail in terms of your introduction,th the issue one A which is the is the housing provision reasonable ? Ye Yes indeed I do. I was taking a step at a time and Yeah well I'm quite happy. Okay. Can I can I just say before you start Mhm. Er I should have reminded everybody at the beginning, when you wish when you start to speak, would you please introduce yourself, give your name and who you represent. So we can make absolutely certain on the recording. That's each time. Sorry Mr . Before we start chairman, I wonder whether we can make sure that Peter , North Yorkshire County Council, that all round the table have got the relevant North Yorkshire paperwork. And I think the documents that we have put in are N Y one,posi various positions er statements, Paper N Y two, described as population household economic activity rate projections, assumptions and methodology. N Y three is a county council commentary on the regional census study, funded by the local authorities and the D O E. N Y four is a paper entitled Housing Growth Provision. And then we miss a number erm er and move to N Y eleven which is a paper which we have put in which attempts to look at the differences between certainly between the they But I'm not gonna change, if anybody don't, but if they can't accept me No, I don't really think so ! well they must er Well er , you can't say that it's hard to understand because I'm a Londoner and Yeah. for a long time I have been Yeah. and you never say anything that I don't understand, unless you were to use a word like crome. Well quite Oh yeah. a word, an Yeah actual word Yes. Yeah. that you've never come across. Yeah. Mm. But after all, once is enough, and once you know, you know don't you? Exactly! You don't forget. No! No. Erm You don't. No. No I That's right. I found coming into Suffolk from Hertfordshire I hadn't heard the, any East Anglian dialect before at all erm I didn't find it difficult, there were only two cases and I can remember thinking there were two people er, one of whom is still alive, er who I had great difficulty in understanding and I thought when I can follow both of them without any difficulty I shall know I really belong. Yes. And, it didn't take long with one of them, that was Dennis Mm, Dennis . and the other one, I don't know whether you knew him, I think he lived in Earlsome for a time didn't he? No, well Monksome Didn't he? Monksome Monksome Erm, a chap called Ben erm No, I don't No. I expect he was days before and my word he was difficult to follow! Was he? Yeah. Yes. Er he spoke fast, that was the problem, most Oh yes! Suffolk people don't. No, they don't. They give you time to listen and time to think They do. but he spoke quickly with a very strong accent and that Yes. took me a lot of years before I could and I was so pleased when once I was able to say to you I've Ben had been in the shop and we'd had a chat hadn't we? Yeah. You and me and him and Joe , was another Yeah. one and we'd had a chat for a long, long time and I said to him afterwards, I was able to understand everything he said! Wonderful! I was so pleased ! That's an achievement ! Yes ! You know one thing that's striking me at this moment actually, when you talk about when you came into Suffolk and you Mm mm. met er, Hector and you told me once before you had no eyes for anyone else there. That's right. Perfectly true! Erm , in these days when er, so large a proportion of marriages breaks down Mm. erm it seems to me that the marriage that has an interest to your occupation, let's say, in the man's hands Mhm. if you like Mhm. er, although you've got your own artistic contribution which you also combine with True, yes. Hector's work That has been a great erm strength to us. Oh, I think that's a a tremendous Yes. strength to a marriage! Yes. Yes. I feel the same with Noel Yes. if there's something really interesting that you have Yes. between the two Yeah. of you Yes. Yeah. erm, you don't give up at the first little hurdle. Course you don't! No, No. No It makes an incredible bond doesn't it? Doesn't it? Absolutely! Yeah. I feel that. Yes! Yeah. Yes. Makes it a good recipe for a good marriage. Ooh yes! Yeah. Yes. It really does! And I th , I think about a great deal because it's a very strange, it's a very strange thing to talk about but when I came to Suffolk, I might have told you this before er, I had hardly been away from home at all, I was only seventeen when I first met him Mm. and I had a very sheltered life, I was an only child, I hadn't been around much, I hadn't stayed away from home erm and I came to Suffolk to visit a girl penfriend who was working at Brandeston Hall and erm she at that time was expecting to get engaged to a chappy in the village here who was, and still is a friend of Hector's and ours, and they didn't marry in the finish but she at that time wanted me to come up to Suffolk to see her and to meet this chappy who she thought she was going to marry and erm so, it was holiday from the art school where I was and I thought well why not? I'll erm, I'll venture and, and my parents said yes, that would be alright and so er so I came along and erm of course, it happened that he was in the he was in the forge talking to Hector on the first evening I came and that was how we met. Mm. And erm,i it was an extraordinary thing! But added to that, I can well remember staying at Kettleborough Chequers erm and er walking along from Kettleborough to Brandeston erm th the very next morning after I'd come here and I think it was before I think it was quite likely before we had we had actually met, I don't know whether it was the first day or the second Yeah, that we met in in the shop there but the strong impression I had is walking over the hill from Kettleborough where the gun club now is walking down into this valley and seeing that view of this little end of the village nestling in the hollow and I can remember feeling a extraordinarily strong sensation that I could easily live there Yes. I could belong there Yes. and I had never felt it anywhere else and I've never felt it since! Isn't that wonderful! But it, there was something that felt right. I yes, I really believe in that Yes. feeling! A sense of belonging. Most extraordinary! I belong here. Yes. Yes. Because I hadn't been around much, I hadn't been away from home Really? and i it was quite forcible! Yes. And er Marvellous! Yes. I think if one's receptive to things like that Yes. you know, it si , it Yes. it strikes you Yes. doesn't it? Yes Mm. It does. And er There was a rightness about it. And you don't forget it because No! you're young enough to be so impressed by it. Mhm. Yes. Yes. That's wonderful! Yes, there was a rightness about it. Right. Okay . Ha. Erm and er I've felt that same sense of rightness at many times over these years, this is now our thirty seventh year? Thirty seven, yeah I Nineteen think so. No, thirty eight. Thirty eight. This is nineteen ninety two. Yeah. This'll be our thirty eighth year in December. So it's several. Erm there have been times doing work which we have er, worked on together different jobs when I have thought, yes this is what I'm here for. Yes. Very, very strongly! Yes. And never, never more so than, of course, working on the sword stand. Yes. Never more so than that! That was wonderful I thought wasn't it? I the work I'd done in the past the training I've had the experience I've had with Hector and his work that was all leading up to that. All coming to it. It all came together. Yes. I can quite see that really. It all came together. Because Yes. that was a whole thing wasn't it? It was the culmination. Connection with the Yes. city. It was! It was! Er Mhm. the ancientness of the Mm. actual Yeah. thing Mhm. you were copying. The significance of what it was for. For. Absolutely! Yes. Everything Absolutely! about it. And now, of Yes. course, it sits Mm. America with Yeah. Mm. its sword in it Yeah. Mm. on certain occasions. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. It's a it's a permanent tribute to your It's collaboration It's an extraordinary forever in America. it is an extraordinary thing, an Yes. amazing, an amazing sensation Yeah. for it to be, isn't it? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. It's wonderful! Yes. Yes. And erm Feel like I've done a shift already. I know. We haven't been away. It's the time of year where you're starting to think I wonder if we'll be nearly finished. I'm yawning already! I know. I dunno what I'll be like at seven o'clock tonight. Mm. I don't do anything in the morning you know. Tell me when there's a at lunchtime. Yeah. I only did about an hour's work, that's all I did. Some of them I did. What shall I do now? I know. Should I get ready? Should I take the, take the dog I know. out or It all depends really Am I to take the dog, the dog was left at mam's because I'm gonna be out over Yeah. six o'clock and that when I would normally walk in. I could nay of told the Yes. Well I'm gonna have to erm phone Tony and he in, he might be going home. And then come and pi pick me up. Yes. Probably better if I just stay at work and come and pick me up. Tt! Oh ! It's stupid! Come and have a cup of coffee and Tony can pick you up and all. Geoff dropped the radio in the bath and put a hole in it? Who? Put a bath, a hole in the radiator? No. In the bathroom? In the bath. In that bath? We need a new bathroom suite. So now you can't have a bath? I've a gotta bung stuff . Come across my number? Well I can have one every sort of, but I just get into the bath just after the water is slipping out. And he's pulling the sink Oh no! off the wall to do summat and just re-cement or something so I've gotta wash my toothbrush, and tooth and wash my face in the kitchen sink. How are you getting home?in there alright? I'm gonna have to get Tony to come and pick us up. Like th are you gonna stay on another day or what are you doing? Are you coming in with me and in the library or whatever? Oh no! Being dropped at half past eight in the morning Yeah. till two o'clock? Well I've got the flat there Oh yeah. and that wait. Mm. Oh I can't, I can't work in the morning though. I worked in my room. I wanted to go, go to the library but I thought I'd start in my room so You know if I came in to see Kim, your room, we'd never get anything done. Yeah that's it. And then once Helen and that had woken up that was about half eleven she woke up and then it like, oh,our provisions and then we started talking and everything else together like Do you work from half eight till half eleven? Well, she . I didn't, I work, I started at half nine and I finished at half ten and I went to you know. I started about five to eleven, and I finished at twelve. Then I had to get ready to go to the bank. To get the So is Tony gonna be staying awake until the time that you finish there? Well I was saying to Alison, the only thing I can do is when I phone him he's gonna come. Go this morning and then come straight here. Oh! More than likely. I know. I know. Maybe she'll stay at work and come and pick me up. So either way one of you's gonna be hanging around. I mean, either you've gotta hang around in the morning, or he's gotta hang around at night. Don't know. Is, is he leaving before then or what? Or you gonna take the car or get the bus? No I'll take the car. I could never get the bus here. Your telling me! Well I know, I mean you This is typical! I know. I know, isn't it? Such a waste of time isn't it? I mean what have we done, we ended up coming all this way . I've got a headache already! Mm. Oh yes! It was brilliant! It was buzzing! Yes, but it was the day Oh yeah. that I had my perm, and you know how it's dead It was sticking up here . and I thought it was just tickling tickly you know and erm it wasn't until I,su I went and sat back in my seat I was watching And been him doing it.

Well they just said that all your stresses would go away which was Did they? the, no. Oh!. I mean, I was like, you know, I was still worried. I was still worried. Still stressed. But erm I felt as though, I felt exactly the same, I felt I'd just been asleep I just had my eyes shut and I felt opening one eye to have a look out and see what people were doing. That's like that is it? So then People were looking at you. and then I was away and he wasn't there any more and I thought, what do I do now? So I opened my eyes and he come rushing over and he said, are you alright? Would you like a glass of water? And I said, no I'm fi you sure? I'll you get you no. Fine. Fine. And then he said well take a seat when you're ready. Started giving me a . So I thought, right you are . I thought, oops! Erm Really? Yeah. Were you Well immobilized? well I won't get it now .

We went into this room and there was this music playing like on the erm like John Indian music. would play on the Oh no. on erm Like in fantasy Yeah. John's sort of thing. You know water a blue light bulb in the middle of the room and I'm thinking, Oh! Come on! What are letting yourself in for? You know. But it was just I mean, the things that they said honestly weird. They're good aren't they? Did I tell you once that a nurse on erm radiotherapy did my psychometry? Yeah. Did I tell you? Yeah. I remember you said. Well this, did I, didn't I tell you? Yeah. Oh sh I've definitely heard this one. What was that? She was holding my fob watch and she said a few things about this, and about us and about dead people and She was closer to you and things like Yeah. that. Yeah. Well this guy, he went Yeah. Oh! the same person was there with exactly the same message. Cos she said what happened was he said Was she fed up? Dunno. He'd already got the message and met someone else ! It's a him. It's a him. They'll not let, let somebody else have a turn ? Well it was, what happened right, I'll tell you the whole story from the very beginning. But basically, the man that, you know, my father said to me well he said to where's the horses? He says I'm getting horses all the time. And of course my Aunty Annie, Gwenny went and he says is it you? I said, well could be. Well, you know He said just everything that was happening, I kept getting horses. And anyway, he said to me he says is there a man in the spirit world close to you? No! So I just thought of my granddad. And I said, yeah, but I was very sort of non-committal Non-committal. Yeah. and very, well I suppose Yeah. kind of Could be. attitude. Could be. Erm, cos I just thought he was guessing, you know, and he said he says, I didn't see him, he said I only saw him and pointed to this girl over the other side of the room he was standing beside you when you were in the chair. Oh no! He says I'll get her to come over and have a chat with you. And she came over after Did she describe him? Aha. So who was it? My dad's granddad. His name Oh no! and everything. His physique, his erm his physical appearance, his character and why he was there and it's exactly what that Merv said off radiotherapy. Mm mm. Why was he there? There's something I've got to do. I need a bit of a push to do it. But there's something that you want to achieve, there's something you've got to do Got to make a jumper. get on and do it. Qualify this. That is exactly what it's not. Yeah. It's your riding. Well that's what everybody says. Yeah. Or it's having a baby. Well I don't think it is. It's probably getting married. It's getting married, yes . I don't think it is. Well what's your main I thi main ambition in life? I think it's to do my riding exams but, I ca as I said, cos Brenda whose horse I ride up at Bridley I was telling her and I said, why would the spirit world get in such a state About riding exam. about me doing riding exams? He said he said which wo what would happen if you got your riding exam when you qualify nursing? I said well I'll probably choose Yeah. riding. I wouldn't know. He said well really for some reason you ought not to be a nurse. I mean, you know how th if you believe in fate and is, is there any control over it or Yeah. is it all planned out for you and Mm. and this kind of thing, is, is someone trying to steer your care or your, the rest Away from of your life? away from something. Which it would be. Away from something. So I don't know, I mean, I'm very open-minded, I mean Oh yeah. but erm he described a, my mum told her everything about a fall the bump on her head, he knew Oh. just loads of things. Very strange. I found that research book. Doesn't Jane look yellow? What? D'ya think Jane looks a bit yellow? I've probably got reflection off her . I know. See if any of us look,ta talking about yellow. Mm. Mm. So? So it was very good. I dunno if I would go to one now. Well I, I want to go now, to er, erm and just try one of the other ones. Tonight I'm gonna go the open circle. I wish I could go. I, I would go, but I'd be frightened to stay there. Well I am whe So am I. see what happened is, I came over and he says, you know I've told this lady that you saw the man standing beside her and she went she sort of, she described him, apparently he was very tall which Yeah. we knew wasn't my granddad cos my granddad was knee high to a grasshopper, erm straight as a dye in character and physical appearance, er like he had a rod up his back which was one of these expressions, Oh! I see. which apparently he was. Obviously I've never met him. I don't think my dad even met him. Yeah. And then she said erm she said, and I suppose she turned to the other guy, she said, we're not supposed to do clairvoyants, like, laughing, you know. And he says, ah, go on it's the end. Cos the all the was over. And then he actually went into a A trance? well not a trance, it was just so normal. She tho she was doing this right as she spoke Like Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost? No! Oh. Dead normal! She, she was going like, you're me and I'm her Ha. and she was standing, I was sitting like, she was standing, she sort of went can you take a Lesley? I went yeah. She says, not in the spirit world. Can you take a what? Lesley. And I said well, yeah and I've got a cousin Lesley . And then nothing more was said about that. And then she was going there's something you need to do. She was literally having a two-way conversation, although, not in an odd way, not going ooh! Ooh! Ooh! You know? She was just like talking to herself, she's going Yeah. and then she would turn her attention back to me. Mm. Oh! How strange! And described him and She thinks she his name. might be going on Wednesday. And Lyndsey might be able to tell you something. Well I know. Well that's what I'm thinking. I'll go, my sister's going with us and I'll, the following Wednesday I'll tell you what it's like. Right. Right. Okay. Come with us. Then we'll go and see the district nurse on Wednesday, is there anything you want me to say? But it's not real But I don't, what if I don't know things? Then I might spend the rest I know. of my thinking I know. It's just that you won't that hasn't happened yet. Well, if you're that sort of person, I would worry about them you see. Now Yeah. someone said to me, I know not, not like an accident or death or anything, but someone said erm you don't have any sisters or something? I would imagine, in my mind, that something's gonna happen to my sisters for her not to be able to see it. I was just thi I remember when I was young I thought my mum went to a fortune teller and, and I had there like tears running Oh! Oh . And she told us we were gonna move to a house with a green door . And did you? My mum bottled out when we got there. Well Bet your there must be a . the thing, the thing that erm worries me is in case I go over is, that you say You're not gonna have any children. you're gonna have two marriages. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's right, you know. Because someone told Tony's mum that Tony would be married twice and the second marriage would be very happy. But then you'd taken that to be that first woman, that Gill person, Gill Yeah Yeah. somebody. Yeah. But that's it. You will really But if they say to me, I'll be marri I'm just gonna be thinking oh my God! But you will relate it, cos no matter what they say you will relate it. Yeah. will be along after this. Keep the noise down thank you. not here. Right. Moving swiftly along er, the little thing on the timetable you know for the the last session where it says quiz it's not really a quiz. It was at the end of the the module. But what we are gonna do is, is give out your study guides and the areas that we'll be revising. We'll do it now. While you're I don't think I'm even gonna bother revising for this. I'm not. Will it be a multiple choice or a written or a Oh yeah. And do I have to ? I think, I think so. A mixture I suppose. Well I can't be A mixture. bothered. Is it serious? Is it like a Serious ? Well it's for yo for your benefit. It's no one 's but . must have all this studying won't they? Don't worry about it. What do you use to chew in Ooh! This looks a little bit less ? doesn't it? What colour is an orange ? What do what is this last thing you have er according to you? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! What? Not like who was that man's enemies and things like that. Like the last one. Name the se dwarfs or what they're called? Yeah. Name the seven dwarfs. And certain parts are The false formastation and things. No! That was stupid that! And I got it wrong. You got it wrong? What was that? Blooming stupid question! It was the way it was phrased. Oh, so expulsion of of sperm. And it was, it was something. And it was ejaculation But I thought it was masturbation. Well I thought it was the forced Yeah. Well, it's funny, I was telling Stephen, my boyfriend, about that, and I was telling him the question and he said Yeah. that. Oh. Well Geoff laughed at me when I told him. He said, er bloody typical! Yeah but don't he said . We want a break now. The stupid old bag hasn't looked at it! I've got a headache. That's June . Determined to sort but she's gone now. No, it's not. That's June . She is, cos I lent her th you know. I know. That's what I was thinking. Well they're not the same are they? No. I had to take Tony to the casualty on Saturday? Why? Got a crack on the side of his head at rugby. And he, he, er and his hearing went. Ah! Ah! And he was feeling a bit back taken. Mm. Is he alright? He's got i he's got a card with I have had a recent head injury. Signs to look for. Ah! Oh! Please report immediately. Who? Tony. Tony. Has he? What happened to him? He got a knock on on Saturday. But I think it was when he was tackling and erm ? got a cra no he didn't black out. And he says, but he got like a crack on the side of his head and his hear Oh! On his head? and his hearing went Any questions about that guide? so I had to take him Was it bad that ? Was it the R V I or the General? No. Was it bad? I'll sho oh I'll show ? Yes. well he's er, he says he's done a big X-ray. Mm. This is your study guide. Work your way through the guide and you're going to answer all the questions on the quiz. As usual, the papers are taken and they're kept in the file for yo reference by your personal tutors. The reason that we're gonna produce biological science quizzes is they're, it's from your feedback evaluations that you don't get enough biological science. Soon put right. Not a lot more I can say to you is there? Oh I know. Yeah. I never said that. believe it or not. There's about sixty percent I might have said that. of the people who are at the end of a said they didn't get enough. We haven't had enough biological science. So that'll teach us to . didn't want the sixty percent. the little areas as well though. You do need to have a basic knowledge of Yeah. biological science to understand Unfortunately you didn't have to do the . Providing you have . Would you agree? Yeah. Anybody dares Yeah. to disagree? No. Right. Very sensible. Cos Jane doesn't wanna be on the . Now the nasty erm half past seven session sorted out. What can, what can we do for another three hours ? I re I think we'll go and I'll think you just go for tea and come back in Yeah ! Four and a half an hour. we've got. Good God! You can have ti be back at half past three. Okay?

For my wellbeing . Anyway, she's lost the battle Wouldn't that do it? Watch what episode you put on. I know. Do we have any idea what time we'll be finished? Cos I've gotta phone my ? When Carole finishes when Carole finishes in this session I'm gonna go and have a chat with her. Because what we'll have to do is negotiate at the end of the next session, whenever we've finished, cos that's entirely dependent on when we get fed up varies on what When we run out say, I mean, you know, what your response to the session is. But usually it finishes within an hour and a half the next session. Which might Right. well finish at five o'clock. Right. Five o'clock. Right. And then i then it's time for a break again. Now I think we've gotta be careful, if we cut out the breaks, you see Aha. an awful lot of people saying let's work right through you're not affective, you're not learning No. if you No. haven't gone away No. and had No. a break. And I mean, there's, you know, the people who smoke need a boost of nicotine they'll go and get Yeah. one. Like if you wanna get a Coke People who drink Coke need a Yeah . Well we, we'll be off as much as anyone else, but you've gotta Aha. you se Yeah. well I'm gonna be off more than anybody else. when I spoke to Carole and she wasn't happy about it.

What she hasn't live with him? Well, she's stayed with him for like weekends, or weeks. Mm mm. She's doing everything that she's going to. I know, but it's a I think it's the family. Mm. I didn't realize her family didn't know mind. You'd think the brother and sister would. Well, I think they do, but they just pretend. Mm mm. The family likes to pretend that they do. Because it's, it's easier, they don't like to to realize these things. I think it's very romantic. The whole thing . Oh I don't think she's saying that. Yeah I know. But you know about, typical woman. families have sex before marriage. Well a how many people though Alison? Not very many. Someone in my hairdressers were talking about it.

I think she's got nice hair. Yeah but she does well in her exams so Don't you think these things are important? What that you've got lovely hair? No, that you do well in your exams. No, that you do well in your exams . Denise isn't interested in her hair really. No. She was only saying it as a balance. No. I was gonna ask her where she gets her hair done actually. Well that's right. She's got a bit of money there. She lives down there. By herself? Those with the bay windows? Yeah. Yeah. Tt. Along that row, she's, her dad They're very nice. her mum died of cancer. She lives with Ah! Ah! her dad. Mm. How old is she? And she got a younger sister. Twenty. Oh! Oh!there. I says to her, you bloody well do that then! Can you take the ? Four hour . Beg your pardon? Er, shut up! Don't forget you said this is still . I didn't say that. Yes you are. They will tell you. What? And then we won't know when we go. I'm getting a bit spooked about this exam now. I am. I keep suddenly thinking of the enormity of it. And th the fact that I haven't really revised. At least you, you are in the same place. I keep thi I keep sitting down to it and thinking God! There's so much I haven't done for this exam. As usual, I should have started ages ago. But I found when I looked at my books a week ago, or a fortnight ago, I thought, oh I know this, I know this, but it's not until you get into it that you think shit! I don't know this and I could be learning. A week ago I didn't know what to learn and now there's so many things that I know I want to learn. Mm mm. Well every time, every time we come in and she mentions, have you done this, that Yeah. and I think Can I have one of them things? I know. You. You. What? Fizzy gum balls. Oh. She always does. Get one of them I'll get one It's only funny when Pardon you! Thi a I have to say that she does it all the time and she goes, looks around. Does it . A girl I used to work with at the Beechams did like really big burps. I'd say she ate about anything and like pardon me. She would . My grandma's like that. Horrible! I mean she wo she says pardon me or excuse me, but it's so matter of fact that I'd be I could never burp like that if I tried, you know. She did a big, I went in the kitchen at at work on Friday and Saturday What time, what time have we gotta, do we have to be back? Twenty past. And the, the chef's were squeezing the custard carton and it was going cos it was the last and the Custard? You mean they don't make their own custard? Nah! They don't make anything man. Tt! And they were squeezing it out of the carton and it was making this right farty noise. I'm not kidding, the three of them,thir thirty odd year old one of them is, they were on the Well I've been floor laughing! One was going, the other ha ha ha! The custard's going My dad's forty And I'm thinking three and he still How old? does things Do you not like that though. do you not laugh when a squeezy bottle does it? No. Oh! I think it's so funny ! I mean, it's funny like when you burp because you get, embarrass you like. Oh no, it makes me laugh. And there's loads of people round about me and I just went wurgh! And I'd like to be fined . I hate people that erm when my dad burps, if, if it was a cup he'd go excuse me, but but it's when they go I hate that! I do. Cos I don't. I'll conceal a burp, no matter where I am. Well you don't obviously ! Well that er popping out. someone really. You could tell I didn't know it was coming. You can tell it was but make Geoff makes him burp. Oh no! I don't. Cos he feels he's got a wind so he Oh I can't force myself. Nor can I. Aargh. What was that? Oh. When's Tony coming for you tonight? I said half past seven. If we finish before then I shall be very annoyed! They said eight o'clock, quarter to. Quarter to eight cos they started at quarter to six. I could just sleep. Just feel like I'm not learning anything . I know. But then the thing is, Exactly. so I'm not learning anything and then we're to . What have I done all day? I know what . in the past two days. It's like what I said to Tony last night when I got in I said, I feel I could have achieved more if I'd stayed at home and revised. Yeah! I could of. He said but,yo you wouldn't of. I said well I would of that's the whole point. I would have revised all afternoon. I know. Anne was saying when Anne she was revising I've never seen No that was right. The whole . . Sorry I didn't offer anybody cos No that's alright. Oh. And I, when she's revising she says oh I've just done about change and theories of change. Who? Theories of change. But we started with Fred and only got Have you remembered that? a third of a ye way through it. Change in the N H S. Change, do you know what change she's talking about? Freezing, something when er a liquid is freezing and it changes when it is you know changes in the physical sense of the Yeah. word. That's what they learn about. I said oh that's what I've got then. Cos I'm talking about change in the N H S is all we can put down. Here's Anne. But then it's just how bad it. Oh! I wish we'd just done that . It's so, simplified. So basic, so logic. I mean, what do we need about planning something? We don't need it. I mean, I didn't understand much to be honest anyway. I wasn't listening cos I was writing them down. The thing is, with this I don't think half the people listen to you're meant to know you're meant to, in these exams you're meant to have everything you should know and everything else That's it. I'm sitting writing notes and I'm thinking am I ever gonna look at these again? Cos every time I have an exam it's a exactly the same things. I have got revision cards coming out of my ears! And erm which I'll never look at again at all. We're all looking very sorry for ourselves. Well what relevance is it to me? Is not I know. I'm not gonna be a nurse anyway. And I'm gonna go away next, next weekend aren't I? Tony said I need to do some exercise late at night. Cos I annoy him. Because as soon as I go upstairs I'm wide awake. Mm mm. He says you should go, go jogging or something late at night. I said well if you got us a dog I'd have to take it for a late night walk wouldn't I? Come jogging with me. Do you fancy coming jogging? What? Last thing at night? Yeah. You go first thing in the morning. I know but I can go at night as well. No, what, do you play squash? What like eleven o'clock? I don't, I've never played it but I'd certainly like to but I wanna play again. I play Mm. He says it's very unusual, you never see me like this . Ooh! I quite fancy doing that. We should have done. You know I was thinking today I was thinking today erm there's a horse Sorry. Say that again. there's a horse erm in some of the fields just coming out of Morpeth towards Newcastle and I saw, pardon me as I was on the bus like yesterday coming into Morpeth and this horse just shot out of nowhere and it was really enjoying itself! It was like galloping along ! as if it was racing. Yeah. Yeah! It was just like this ! And then it thing and it came, it was really galloping towards the fence and then, cor! Right up Yeah. to the fence. It stuck a All of a sudden. And I was looking, I was thinking, oh! To be free like that. Mm. And then today when I was passing it was just munching away in the corner, you know. And I was thinking, tt, it must nice, Alison's got a hobby she can just go out and you know, do it to get away Shall I tell you what it is, sometimes from everything. I go back from , I'm driving over to Brenda's and I'm thinking,, and I really am, I'm driving along, you know like wha when you're in the car by yourself and everything's turning over in your head Mm. and go and I tack up the horse and I get on the horse and everything and I don't mean to say Falls away. I'm drifting through the countryside cos No. it might be and I'll go over the level crossing I'll think, ooh that was a bit you know, things like that and then we'll see another horse in the field and Canter goes, ooh ooh it's all so everything Mm. it's, it's, it's on a different level, it really is. And because you could, you could just like ride away and not come back ever. Even when you come back you feel much better. You feel, oh I really enjoyed that. And it's a different kind of enjoyment, but, I mean I've never played squash Do you feel like that when you run? Well, well it must be the same. Or like when I, if I we say maybe, now I can't imagine feeling like that except with horse riding, but I suppose you do, whatever your thing is. That's it. It is. Er I wish I had a hobby or a outside interest. It has to be outside I think. Definitely. Yeah. Outside outside. That's it. I suppose Suppose like the riding. everyone feels like that. I think I would, I think I feel like that everything will still be there while I was riding along. Oh! I have to stop and think about it, but I You know what your natural endorphin would come to the surface and you just start getting the feeling of well-being. Well that's the thing like, it's You come to solutions and conclusions and everything's right with the world. And we'd better go back now. If you twitched a horses lip or ear that happens, I would really like to see if I twitched your ear. And can we get a Well Yeah. Mm. It brings their endorphin to the . Did you see The World According to Garth? No. On Sunday. Well I saw a little bit of it, if I wo I keep wanting to see this film Mm. and I've never actually seen it. If you know what I mean? And erm oh just put them on that table over there. No I don't wanna get back there, I don't wanna go back up to the wards so I'll go that way or that way? That way. That way? Thanks. Yeah. I've forgotten which way I come in. It's easily done. Bye. And erm he's, he's got these papers like with short stories Mm. and the wind blows them away out of his hand, so erm Shit! Oh shit! you're meant to get them in the bin not out of the bin. And th he's picking them all up and this one there's a like a rockwe erm, doberman pinscher standing and these papers between his legs . urgh! Urgh! Like this, and he's saying, Bonkers, now give me that paper! Give me that paper! The dog just leaps on him right,so he's wrestling this dog, and he's screaming and the dog going, growling at him and everything Aha. and then suddenly you hear the dog goes running off and he's bit its ear! So he goes to see his mother who's a nurse at the Aha. school where he lives, cos she's the nurse, like a matron, and er she said Garth! What's this? Was it its ear ? The dog's ear . It's a little triangle of the dog ! Oh no! I mean it was cruel Oh my God! but it was funny cos he just aargh! Like this . Ah ah ah! The dog went off yelping. Bless its little cotton socks. Bet that didn't release its natural endorphin. Ah Ah. We'll have a slow mosey. Mhm. I find, tell you what I find difficult is thinking and learning in that class. Mm. Some of the people aren't conducive to learning. I know. I know. And I try not to get stroppy, I try to be you know, otherwise I'm being a complete crab and not joining in, but Mhm. I've found I have to have a lot of conditions. Everything has to be just so for me to be able to learn. It has to be right. I mean half the time I think I don't remember anything because er er, people are so busy blooming playing around and Mhm. shouting and And I'm too nosey to block things out. and When I was sitting in that corridor there was one of the tutors on the phone, only for a short while and I couldn't even blot him out cos I was too nosey to listen to what he was talking about. I don't think it's deliberate. But I'm No. I'm reading Just curious. I'm aware of it. Naturally curious. I can't revise when I know that Geoff's in. If he is, I go upstairs to be by myself. The telly has to be off. Well you see I have to have the telly very quiet and last night, ah! To I'm sure he's going deaf you know. Mm mm. And I, I keep going down and I'll turn it down, and then I'll go out room and he turns it back up again. It's like living with a cantankerous old man ! It's enough to make you deaf. What? Well the sound quality's not very good. I says, well I can hear it upstairs! He says well you're The trouble is you're just over-sensitive! what you can hear upstairs is going, ooh ooh, ooh ooh! Oh! Ooh ooh! And the music! Yeah. The theme tunes that are on. Oh ! Dear me! I wish it was that. Well I'll go and get two, three. I'll soon get Oh yeah. Yeah. Well that's your fault. I was saying I thought she was lovely! Yeah. Exclusive to Mm mm. Mm mm. Yeah. It's nearly time for Neil. I'm cold now. It's cold in here. The nights are drawing in. Impact and intervention A ball? bodily functions . The Newcastle College of Health Studies Ball . Yeah? Erm, yes. Twenty pound a ticket! That's what it was last time wasn't it? Meal, disco and band. Well, can I tell you the first one we went to we went to get food and there was none left! Well that'll be on the . And there was a lovely spread! But by the time we got there, and there was and there was people there I've never even seen before in my life! I suppose this one's it's cheap. That was, it's always the one beside the Civic Centre one? Yeah. The one you went to when I was ill? It's good like. Yeah. If you can get in. It was me and Clare dancing on the table there. difficult to get in. At least it was just us and we were gonna Well have you seen Helen's video? No. No. Nobody has. Oh! It's brilliant. Have you,can I ask, have you got pink in your hair? Yeah, I've I sprayed it pink for the Rocky Horror and I can't get it out! I was, I keep looking and I'm thinking Is it pink? it's the light. It's the light. It's still a bit pinky. Just a little bit. Was it good? The Rocky Horror? It was brilliant! Eh! It took four shampoos to, to get the bugger out! I thought it was my eyesight. No. No. I love the Rocky Horror Show! Anyway, she's got the erm video right Mm. and there's a bit with Helen and Steve and you know what Helen was like when they was Steve? drunk. Big Steve. And sh Oh! Right. they showed it to, to me. It was her face! And, and Ellen was gonna bring it into college but ca er Helen said don't you dare! So she's, she's Yeah. cut out that bit. That bit. Ellen cut it off. Oh! Oh! Yeah. Cut it? Yeah. So, it was ever so bad apparently ! It was really good. Everyone was on it. Everyone was having a good time. It was really good. Well th maybe I should look at it seeing as I missed it. I can just remember Helen's bum! You were in hospital. That's all I saw all night! Denise. What on? That do at Aye. I just remember her backside wherever I saw always Helen's backside. I think they should have another one. Seeing as I missed it. Yeah. Yeah. And come back with Mark . I spent my whole night following him around! Following him round. And you, and with Steve, Ellen can pick it out. Oh have you? Well you shouldn't have cos we wanted to see I've seen it and, and it was the best the best time I had was . It was good. Right. Am I telling you about this? Yeah. Sorry. Have I made much sense so far? Yeah. Yeah, but I the man Can I the patient looks outside in and carer looks inside out. Inside out. Right. And here's, here's his journey right. G P appointment, outpatient appointment, tests, admission, medical treatment, nursing care,planning and follow-up. And that's the patient from his journey out? That's his journey right? Here, he's looking in how he came, where is it? Route. Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba But is it the round window, the square window, or the arched window? There's one. Da, da, dee dee dee. Right, it says here,quality can only be asse assured ,pa beg your pardon,if both patient's view, he's looking in there. Right. in, and the care-givers view looking out are in agreement . Right. What if they're not? What To a is the one that we're actually doing? Yeah. That's right. To achieve this quality assurance should mean, that when the patient feels his care is not good he should know how he can complain without any worry that he will be penalized, and in the certainty that action will be taken immediately . And that's these things here. There's patient questionnaires, complaints, da da, er ba la visitor inspections, complaints, patient questionnaire, there's a basically all the same kind of thing, or relative survey. Patient questionnaire. So, basically, what they're saying there's all these things that they'll provide at each stage of his journey so that if care isn't right he knows what channels to go through to complain. My criticism of that being is But what if it's not carried out? it's, it's al the quality's not there to start with. How can you He da he won't know what, what quality of care is though. Well er, the patient has his views about what Yeah. he expects, good nursing care But his views aren't really gonna be necessarily good nursing care cos a lot of people wouldn't know No, everybody's individual. And to get, what it says here, to get quality assurance, the patient's views, and the care-giver's views have to be in agreement. What, say you're the care-giver and I'm the Yeah. patient what I think is good nursing care might not be what you think is good nursing care. But what you know is not gonna be the same. It has to be the same for quality assurance. But it's not gonna be the same. But that will Yeah cos you I tell you what I think It says on our research thing say that, say that erm . Say that Er, say yes to that one. I shan't ask anything. But will it tell me the truth? Well, see, for one is she's not erm as bad as that. You know, some patients I could think of seem to have the idea that everything should be done for them in hospital Mm. and that to them is good care if a nurse does everything for them, but it's not. If, you're taking all Yeah. Mm. And when he goes into Plus they also say that a nurse is always busy and they're angels, and they're, that and the other, that they won't complain. Well that's the only way that this can be assessed, is by, so that the patient blah blah la when a patient feels his care is not good he knows he can complain without any worry . But complaining, I mean, if he's gotta complain it means that quality assurance isn't there. But This is only thing if they've got something to complain about. if you were the patient nurse So there's nothing to actually say In a positive sense? Yeah. Yeah. The only thing that So if it says Yeah. erm meaning ha blah blah and action taken . It should also mean that when Mr , that's it, says the nurses were marvellous, the nurses are able to say in all evidence, and with evidence to support their opinion, yes We were crap! we are really doing a pretty good job. That's all it says in a positi from a positive angle. Yeah but A pretty good job. So what do you think ? But like, if you take like like er,le let me, if you were the patient and Lesley was the nurse and also your own reports erm there's the one about designation of assets you know, which I think was a very good recommendation of yours. I think the actuarial responsibilities and the wider role of actuaries was important. I think the inde independent corroboration for actuaries was another important factor, custody confirmation by the auditors, veto of transfer of assets, independent auditors for pension funds, independent custodian arrangements, in-house investment management, you made some comments, co-ordination or the various regulators, co-ordination of the professional advisors, establishment of a pension tribunal, you know, now as far as I was concerned or on my sort of looking through it, those were all recommendations that, that you've made over your two years and I couldn't really find any response to those in Good and I think that's a you know we, we personally found that disappointing. Also I mean, we take your point and we've made it before Ken that there's a real danger of asking for a report from someone like Professor Gower and then cherry picking it, instead of actually taking the whole, because it does actually add together in some sort of coherence erm and had Professor Gower's report been accepted in its entirety, we may not have been had the pleasure of having you back again today, but thank you very much er all three of you for coming. Thank you very much. I would suggest is the timescale between these things happening and it getting to the regulator and being digested. In the present didn't understand for two years I mean told the regulator Yes, yes er whereas if there were independent trustees responsible to the regulator and they were properly trained, they would I suggest be able to smell out very quickly an malpractice and would have a group straight to the regulator, if only to call a stop for someone to have a look at it. nothing recommended to Goodey in that particular cause is of any good. I don't think so. Erm er Imperial? I M P A Cs belief is that er if you get the trustee balance right, that's the first place where the decision ought to be made, but there should be a fall back position which Good has given, which they they trustees could go to the regulator in the case of er not being able to solve things, but our feeling very much on surplus is that the money is there first for to pay pensions and until pensions are paid up to Inland Revenue levels whatever they are, then no money should go back to the company. The question of taking pension holidays in between out of surplus is a sort of mid midway position, but er very definitely we feel strongly that money should not go back to the company. We have suffered from the same thing as the other two er Abalance have said today of money being used from our surplus to provide for redundancy and erm it's been exacerbated by money being available from the people who were made, made redundant going to the company and swelling their balance sheets while all the cost side of it comes out of the pension fund and that has caused a lot of ill-feeling particularly from the older pensioners who have seen years of inflation, when their pensions were not made up to the same extent. In the old days when there was a possibility of of erm ad hoc payments made er that sort of thing was taken care of, since the takeover of the company that hasn't happened to the same extent, so there's a very strong feeling with the older pay er pensioners that they paid money into a pension scheme which now shows a surplus, but other people are benefiting from it. We need we've got lots more questions to ask you. Peter? Erm Mrs Appleby you mentioned briefly earlier the role of the regulator. How do you see the regulator doing his job with a hundred and twenty-eight thousand schemes to, to monitor? Great difficulty I would imagine. erm er well we welcome the erm er the proposal that there should be a regulator. Somebody er to whom the erm er matters could be referred to er whom er could remove trustees er who are er not acting in er the best interests er of the fund er to whom er I understand that the erm beneficiaries could er appeal if they felt that their fund was being erm used i in the wrong way, which is something that we haven't got at the moment. Erm I mean just going very, very briefly back to the question that you asked erm about this how would you stop what's happen happening is by having, we would have thought a pensioner trustee, because even the question has been asked how did it get through the union trustees, and the answer that most of them are employed and they are looking over their shoulder because jobs are going, redundancies are being made, you've got a pensioner employee er a pensioner trustee on there, and they're not looking over their shoulder for their job, they are going to do the job of a trustee and watch the fund and they would then be able to go to the regulator if they saw something that was amiss, but if somebody is employed by the firm might be very worried about doing because they're more bothered about keeping their job. Though, the case you're putting that the, the pensioner trustee er ship is more powerful than you originally put, cos up to now you've been put it in grounds that it's the trust should be repr representative of it Yes Now you're saying er rather well, that in fact that person or persons could be more independent Yes. because they're actually not worried about being sacked Yes. either erm because redundancies are coming or as Imperial Trustees found, they were just got ridden of as a way of moving them off the trust. Yeah, very good. large carrots being dangled in front of them. I mean we ought to say in our case approved our the proposals of the company, they raise no objections in which only the who raised objections, the employees didn't and in the High Court case we've just said, how can an employee be independent, when he depends upon his employer for his future work. So really what you're saying is that if we're looking at trip wires to stop things happening, there's a power a really powerful case for a pensioner trustee, but you're looking for whistle blowers. Yes. There's also a powerful case for having pensioner trustees that they will so there's far less chance of erm people twisting their arm, although they could have the carrot dangled in front of them. that's But that's the problem we all face isn't it. And we're also saying that if you have a new pensions act, the work of the regulator will be much easier. Why? You won't keep have to be going off to court to find out what is the law at that moment of time. Touche. Could I, could I turn to one of the major contributors of erm of pension fund surpluses er and that is the plight of the deferred pensioner. The person who leaves the company's employment er could I ask you, each of you in turn briefly for some comments about how you feel deferred pension rights can best be preserved, if they can be preserved at all er adequately. I suppose in one way as a pensioner I shall say what happens about you know I'm not worried about if you're a pensioner because every time one someone becomes a deferred pensioner, our surplus goes up Yes. because the liability is extinguished. Yes. I cannot see why the actuary having a liability for an employee, if that employee becomes a deferred pensioner that the actuary having a liability for the fund But don't Yes they are Can I, you the example you did before to other people was that if you worked you know your normal scheme forty years and if you worked for ten of those forty years you become deferred. Do you have a quarter of the right you would expect if you done the forty years. Is that the sort of way one should underwrite the position as a deferred pensioner Yes Yes What I think my colleague is saying is that when the actuary is assessing the commitments of the funds, he is looking at the anticipated increased earnings until the person retires and I think when the calculation is made for somebody who is er a deferred pensioner of leaving er a pension fund to take his money elsewhere a similar calculation or the same calculation should be used, the one that the actuary last used in, in looking forward and saying what the commitments are. That way the fi the surpluses left behind would be less, but the person transferring and we're going to see more and more of this today er takes a fair amount of money with him. But of course if salaries go up evenly throughout a forty year lifespan and the Chairman is given a forty year lifespan which is quite or pension lifespan which is quite a suitable one, if salaries go up and someone leaves their company every ten years, then the first three departures are obviously going to be at much lower salary levels and it's not going to be satisfactory the first three departures are just index linked to inflation, there is the problem of how does one index link them towards the final salary. Otherwise that person having worked for four different employers during the forty years will not retire on two-thirds of final salary, but will retire on two-thirds er only perhaps the last employer for the last ten years. It isn't a question Chairman but it's easy to ask as it seems,we you said a ten year, but what about a thirty service of deferred pension, that could be an entirely different situation, because that is inflation put under the Post Office and B T ones it's inflation proofed every year, so for the ten years, if he's if he's got another ten years before he draws his pension at sixty, he would have that er deferred pension inflation proofed every year. So a thirty year old service might be entirely different than a person with ten years service deferring his pension. Yes, the reason why we picked a forty year lifespan of work or working life er with four tens was because Professor Good himself told us that er on their research the common employment pattern today is in fact four employers over the working life and of course that is very different from the experience of many pensioners who are drawing today from their pension funds, because many of them were long-term, long-service employees throughout their lives with one employer. But you were saying weren't you you described this world which lots of us now have lost and somebody leaving school starting a job and retiring from that job, so the que the question David's asked you is more important isn't it because deferred pensions are probably gonna become more, not less common. They are becoming a lot more common, yes when you look in the report and accounts there are far, far more of these deferred pensioners there than er than ever used to exist and it's something which I must admit we haven't given a lot of thought to yet, but it's something because it's growing that we will have to address erm in our federation, we will have to address that problem. And the danger presumably is that the surpluses we were having our discussion and debate about earlier on, those surpluses that and I do understand why you feel the pensioners should benefit from their surplus, but it the reality is that the employers and possibly the pensioners are currently arguing amongst themselves for the benefit of those surpluses, but in fact one of the significant contributors is often the deferred pensioners Yes. and the deferred pensioners are not actually getting in on the debate, they're not often represented on the trustees in fact. No, they're n they're not represented, erm but I think we would b you know, I mean I think they, they should get be considered certainly erm dependent upon the length of service which they have put in it's certainly something for the future. I was gonna make a point about the one you raised the practicalities of the situation. I don't know enough actuarial work to be able to and what settlements they should receive, but our own experience is that it's hard enough to round up pensioners to form an association and we embody deferred pensioners and they're even harder. We just don't seem to be able to track them down or attract them in quite the same way, so there is a massive practical problem if you want them to have a voice in how things are done, there's no doubt about that. We have that same problem, but er it can be solved quite easily, the employer knows the addresses of pensioners, there's nothing to stop pensioner association being formed. We are unable to get addresses of our so it's word of mouth how we, how we er include, but why should not the employer send to all pensioners and deferred pensioners notices about the associations. Could I ask you very quickly on that note, do you think the answer is to try and set up a voting mechanism amongst the deferred pensioners, or is the answer that one should actually appoint a professional independent trustee, specifically with the duties of looking after the deferred pensioners in the debates that you have identified often take place? We were told that that is impossible to take a vote because with big organisations like B T and the Post Office one example was to sell off a Girobank there are eight thousand people, but they were just told you can either defer your pension, leave it with the Post Office Pension Fund, transfer it to the Leicester and Alliance who bought Girobank, or take your money out and take up a personal pension scheme. They were given no votes or erm opportunities and of course the same thing will happen if and when the Parcelforce is sold off from the Post Office er there's twenty thousand people there. I doubt very much whether they'll be given any opportunity to voice what happens to them when they're transferred or what happens to the fund. They'll be given the same three options I should imagine. So you would feel probably the best mechanism would be the appointment of somebody who is given that responsibility and solely that responsibility of reporting and looking after the interest of the deferred pensioners. Yes. You would agree with that? Yes I would agree, would favour that because I think it would force another issue, if, if the independent rule too often against the deferred pensioners I suspect they'd organise themselves. You see in British Steel we we have seventy thousand deferred pensioners and er it is a group of people that I feel extremely sorry for, because er in nineteen eighty-six British Steel introduced into their pension scheme while it was still in the public sector, retirement at sixty where with a pension credit spaced on length of service, so if you had thirty-five years service in, you could retire at sixty as if you were sixty-five and there was nothing done at all for deferred pensioners and in certainly our submission to British Steel for seeking improvements, we we asked that they er they look at deferred pensioner with a view to paying their pensions at sixty, recognising that it was a very high-class plane that might have to be er achieved in stages. We also recognise that there is a tremendous problem for deferred pensioners in achieving reasonable transfer values er er er it's a massive problem for them, even where they could find perhaps something to do with that money and a scheme that would do them better, not always, because there, there are people that give bad advice, but there are some that go into it very thoroughly and when it comes down to the bit the transfer value they receive makes it im practically impossible for them to do it. But we've got So we would like er to support what you're saying. We've got six more minutes, David? Er shall I combine my two found questions which the Committee would like to put to you please and, and that is there are two points that really do come out of Maxwell very much, but I think you've had some experience. One is bulk transfers and the second is safeguarding of assets. Er in the context of bulk transfers would you like to comment on the Good Committees conclusions on the bulk transfers of members between schemes and how they operate, and do you think that er there is widespread abuse or do you think er on balance your experience has been that where bulk transfers have taken place, they have taken place responsibly, but I would in that context ask you to comment whether there has been an unreasonable time delay where you have experienced bank bulk transfers between the transfer actually taking place in terms of employees being transferred from an undertaking to another undertaking and the actual transfer of their pension funds. What happened in Maxwell's case was that enormous delays took place between the employees being transferred and the actual transfer of their pension. Er and could you also comment perhaps on the safeguarding of assets and any er points you would like to make in relation to the present five per cent limit on self investment. The er issue of stock lending if you heard the Maxwell pensions earlier on comment on stock lending, whether you think pension funds should do that er in the case of Maxwell as you're probably aware a lot of the stock lending was off market rather than on the market and perhaps you could also comment on the use of independent custodians in terms of the custody of investment. Er I'm sorry to throw all those at you very quickly, but they are er obviously five minutes left and B T th the question about bulk transfers. Sorry no not, British Steel, apologies. Well, I, I'd say one thing by illustration from our own situation er we were transferring bulk and I felt that was singularly unfair because the members were given a choice. The existing members were told you can either join the new scheme with its improved benefits, reduced contributions, with certain rules that were operating in favour of the employer that were against them, but it was a balancing act, or if you don't want that you can stay with the old scheme and continue with exactly the same terms. The third choice was the obvious one you can take your money and get out. Er now we, the pensioners, had no choice, we were picked up and put into the new scheme having paid our contributions appropriately to the old scheme rules which were the higher contributions, but only to pick up the new scheme rules that were against our interest. Now I can see no good reason for that being allowable, I'm not quite sure how you stop it, but I think it it's, it's a basic problem with bulk transfer, the individuals do not have a say. Very good. B T? Well I've already said about the bulk transfer Giro, I quite honestly don't know whether any other option can be given to people, they've given the option to defer their pension with the Post or their present scheme, transferred it new company scheme or take out er the money and take out a personal pension fund er I suppose there might be a possibility of offering people after a certain number past a certain number of years the opportunity to remain within the fund they're in but er the contribution and who, who makes a contribution may be a problem, but that's the only other option I can see. We don't believe that pensioners ought to be forcibly transferred, they should be given the choice. And if that was in the Statute, there would could stop the Indeed, yes. Can we then go back to the other one on safeguarding. Very difficult indeed er hearing the Maxwell people talking earlier I think er again and made that point very clear. I think we can point to some of the things that can happen that worry us. Er if you stand back from our situation and see it that er the contribution rate for employees was reduced from sixty five per cent for er a company i it became a balance of cost and that works out now at five per cent, so the total inputs of the scheme is ten per cent of earnings and that was down from eighteen per cent . Er without being an actuary I say to myself that's a pretty magical thing you've done and then it causes you to start looking at the monetary background of all of that an and again I I'm, I'm speaking here largely on what actuarial advice we are beginning to receive. I think the conclusion coming out of that is that as a result of what I've described and a few other things as well, not least the fact that the company has now capped its contribution rate to no more than ten per cent . When it gets to ten, the members stay at five when the company gets to ten, the damage is picked up by either reducing members benefits or restricted index linking. Now with a hundred and eighty thousand of pensioners and forty thousand scheme members and all of the trustees currently made up of employees and scheme members, it's pretty obvious where any correction of loss of funding is gonna come from isn't it. There can only be one target, it's the pensioners. So er when schemes by the good service of actuaries can be re-written in such extreme terms I begin to worry about it and I think it needs an input for more than one direction on the actuarial fund in our case the trustees saw fit not to use actuaries to get away But on actual safeguarding of assets, erm do you for instance with separate custodians, do you have any views about the custody of your schemes assets? Not, no, I, I've really not given thought to that subject. B T, anything? Well I was impressed by the erm the Maxwell erm peoples comments that the funds should be clearly marked pension fund accounts and and that er there would be regulations that this money couldn't be transferred without some the regulator again or somebody making er agreeing to the transaction, but I erm fully understand that would be erm very time-consuming, but er that's the only way I can see that, that the fund should be clearly marked that they're pension fund and shouldn't be transferred without some some authority agreeing to it. We have separate custodians, the Bank of Scotland are doing this and er I think er having a separate organisation outside is er an important first step, but you've then got to tie up who gives them instructions and that obviously needs careful thought, needs to be done through the trustees. just one question that I wasn't able to put on the Committee's behalf, but I think it is something that we would be very grateful for a short written comment and that is the information that your members, that the members of the pension funds actually er rather than your annual members as well in that context actually receive annually and whether you feel that is satisfactory. We can send you that. Yes, I think also how you feel it could be improved would be very relevant and how you would feel in the context of a pensioners meeting, an annual meeting like shareholders have in companies and how you if you have any views on how such a meeting might be managed in relation to the deferred pensioners interests, the existing pensioners interests, the employees interest and obviously the company's interest being adequately reflected at such a meeting but I think we would welcome that aspect. And also efforts you've made to organise yourself as groups and whether you've been encouraged or not encouraged by the owners of the scheme. Thank you. That would be very helpful. Can I thank you for coming today,th th the media often has lots of comments from the chattering classes, saying unhealthy, British democracies, cos they only concentrate on this place. I, I'm not gonna comment whether I think that's right or not, but anyone viewing your contribution today would know that outside there in the big institutions of our society democracy is very healthy. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you. Thank you. We thank you. Clearly one of the issues we've got though, is t we're looking at something like million pound overspend in C I S for the calendar year ninety three which we've gotta try and pull back, at least some of that. We worked out yesterday that probably the overspend in er client services could be between a hundred and eighty two thousand and half a million, not four hundred depending on which scenario you take. Erm the worst scenario takes into account things like erm whacking in another two people in claims, another four in E W S erm i if you go along with the the current situation on volume increases erm and er the simple choice on those is you either pay pay to cover the service levels or you let the service level deteriorate. Mm. Erm but I mean that's forecast for erm more or less now if the volumes stay as they are, so that's an issue. Erm we've also got an issue with erm the post cock-up and that's a technical term you're laughing at are you? Erm cock-up two people to go to John , erm because erm, apart from anything else it was agreed John 's arm was twisted yesterday to take two people and g and the work but the issue is is that the K doesn't, the issue is is that there is no budget anywhere for it either here or down in John's area. And the reason being is that somebody thought that John was taking the work without having to take people, which he can't do. So John's now taking it on the basis that he takes budget with it so So they are going? Yes they will be going. Ah I mean right Mary'll take them all now Yeah, unfortunately erm Does that mean Richard as well from upstairs or Russell, whatever his name is? Russell Russell Ah I don't know if Russell's going, I mean that's something for them to sort out upstairs. Yeah th they were the two people, it's our two part-timers plus Russell. Oh well that's what it is then, yeah. Yeah okay. But you'll need to sort that out with Mary when she's back, she's not back till after Easter anyway. So when's that happening? Well I'll leave that problem for Mary to sort out. But it, we don't save any money from doing that now anyway. In fact we lose money either way. Erm so that's,tha that that's now been done. Erm now potentially, if you totted up, and there's also the data integrity the other reports, which is the sixty K overspend we talked about, now the question is do we spend that, do we spend that this year, what do we do? Now Sorry what reports are they? Well Phil knows what they are. Well we've we're gonna spend it now anyway. No I mean I've started giving reports out to the sections already Yeah I, I know but Is that units? Units reports? Yeah Yeah. on the data correction exercise. Yeah. Oh But the, the question is until you've fixed them they'll stay in in exclusion right? Yeah. Right, so you fix them just as quickly as you can fix them, but if that takes nine months it takes nine months, that's one of the views you can take on it. Yeah. Erm the issue is is that potentially you could be goi we could've been going for four point three extra people and we probably won't do that. But the ne the ne the other issue is that erm on the Jason front, the overspend on the salary, we might well be able to adjust that down in terms of the overall salary review absorb it within that in July. Five grand across the whole we'll, we'll lose it somewhere. Oh what, the k the difference between him being an A and, and the budget being a C? Yeah. Yeah. Okay? Erm on the other side there are some definite overspends which we've got to do some more work on. Erm there's the P W P five year thing which, which we've got to erm cover for which we've covered as two F T E for the six months and then we'll need to review that after that. Erm we've got the same sort of issue with excess relief. And then there's the, the data integrity on units which is the fourteen we've already made some er nominal provision for which is Mhm quote ten quotes people moving across. Erm, in addition to that there's the erm there's the U A three stuff in the first half of this year which is fourteen people for four months, eight people for two months effectively. Erm then there's billing and collection pensions conversion, regionalization all coming in late. Erm now the impact of those is twofold, one is that we've got the overspend on the data integrity and the U A three, cos it wasn't in the budget at all. And secondly the fact that it wasn't in the budget erm and the fact that they're late means that we're not also realizing the productivity in other areas that we had anticipated so we're gonna be some six months late coming in. Now the potential overspend on the definite ones, the ones I just read out, is two hundred and eighteen thousand. But we reckon that in actual fact if you erm don't do the we just dis discount the billing and collection and the pensions conversions and so on that we will actually get some benefits from the, the, the things that we've already put in place this year, we reckon we can reduce that overspend on that side of it down to about a hundred and eighty two thousand erm because it's, it's nominal paper er transactions in a way. Erm so really the issue is we haven't made any decisions yet, these are the things we've gotta try and make decisions on, but we will need to be starting to think them before we get to June. One of the major problems we've got is that erm the w I did some figures yesterday that, that tended to suggest that in fact our productivity performance overall is about two point seven at the moment even without having had in and without having units in and so on, so we have increased our productivity, marginally, despite the fact we've got temps in and we've got those new business people. Erm Wasn't it in the budget the two point seven for the first two months? Yeah but it's now gone up to two point And increases eight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Erm but the reality is that erm we would therefore need our budget to, in fact for the first half of this year, to have, well for the whole year, to have reflected the late delivery of the systems which would've, if we'd had that in the budget and we'd been projecting the whole budget at say two point six, our budget figure would've been somewhere in the region of another eighty to ninety thousand higher than it currently is for this first quarter. Erm so in actual fact we'd've been there or thereabouts had we not made the budget assumptions that we did. Now one of the major issues that we're concerned about of course is the overtime erm which is, if you review the last three months of the overtime which we did the other day, erm we obviously, we spent the annual budget erm allowance. One of the things that we need to, to work out, and Mark 's gonna do some work on that and, and Maureen pro primarily to identify that erm we're spending about thirty five, thirty six K a month over at the moment. Erm now there's two questions really, one is is that partly to offset the erm lack of productivity that we had anticipated in the budget. So in other words is our F T E consistent with where we actually are rather than where we thought we'd be erm or have we got erm you know er the Parkinson's law, been operating with the, the overtime, people are used to doing it and therefore they keep doing it and so on. One of the other impacts we need to work out in fact is the er effect of the overtime as being worked in quotes, by all the quotes people not just the temps, because that's gonna be a significant chunk. If those, all of those contract temps are regarded as full time people it looks like full time people are working overtime, which is why I asked you the question yesterday erm what's the overtime bill for quotes alone. Cos we've got a hundred percent hundred percent increase in volume Yeah in quotes. And th th the contract people, if they are working overtime, are, are paid the, the premium rates Oh right yeah Yeah. So it's, it's costing us Yes it is costing us, yeah. time and a half. But the point is is that for everybody else there was, there is some assumption that we'd be working off of post driven erm response, okay? So if you got more post in, or your productivity in the servicing sections is down, from two point seven it's down actually at two point six is what we're achieving, we're marginally out. But the, every hour of overtime worked in quotes is in fact an hour actually on our budget, it isn't just a pr proportion of it on our budget which is what you've got everywhere else. So No it's not entirely true cos we did have a budget for overtime Yeah but i if you're gonna go over by a hundred percent and you've got people there working overtime Yeah. significantly every hour that they do on that is gonna be signific is, is not budgeted for cos you've got fourteen people there who weren't budgeted for at all. Yeah. So when you get ten of them working overtime, and that, those ten people weren't budgeted to do any overtime. Yeah. So we need to identify to what extent the o the quotes problem erm is cau is, is skewing the figures primarily to be able to get a forecast view of, okay what's the overtime likely to do over the year? I mean as long as it, as long as the graph is reshaped rather than the massive overspend cos at this rate, we're gonna be spending out er three hundred thousand pounds over just on overtime er which we obviously can't afford to do. Erm but that's if you just progr project forward where we are cos we used up in, in three months what we should have done for the whole year so you've only gotta do that, so we've done a hundred thousand pounds this first quarter and if you've four more, three more quarters there's another three hundred thousand pounds over budget. The point is, one of my points is that two things are, are likely to happen. One is that the, the impact of quotes and the other improvements coming through in the second half of the year will reduce some of that impact anyway and also that that hundred thousand pounds overspend is sig is over-skewed because the proportion of quotes work in there is actually making a, making a difference too. But we need to know by how much. So what we're trying to do is get a picture of, okay, what's our, our best guess scenario, what the whole year's gonna look like. We should have that in a few minutes on the, the quotes side, Mark's gonna bring them in to me. Yeah okay, fine. Erm so I think we've gotta look at that right across the board though, we've gotta know that in actual fact we're covering it temporarily, erm or aren't we covering it temporarily. I think all the work that we did indicates that there the productivity is one issue, that unless you're doing the two point eight or whatever's in the budget, you know, we're not gonna get near it. But the other thing is the work that we did on, all the hours that er aren't available on the team Yeah. and that isn't gonna go away unless we No it isn't, it isn't gonna away but when you go back to these figures we've actually been working, if you wo if you accept that there's been, there's no change in our situation apart from auto-offs and units Mm primarily As from now? As from now. Well th since Right yeah since December Yeah. we should be able to maintain the performance that we've done prior to December cos everything else should be equal. Right? With Yeah or without the T As and, and all, with all the other bits and pieces. So what we need to be able to identify is that,al although we will gain the worst scenario ought to be that whatever we lose in terms of auto-off reports and units reports to some extent we should be gaining by the improved productivity overall. So let's just say it breaks even. So our performance, in terms of F T Es per thousand pound, per thousand item, should be running more or less along at the November December level. Right? Now what we've got here, if you look at the F T for ten thousand in force policies, we've got a significant jump in January and February at a time when our budget posting was down below budget. Now that's fair enough because we've actually bunged more in in terms of testing, we're covered in testing, and we've got temps who are less productive, so to an extent we, we, we, we ou our budget did expect that bump. What we should expect though is that it comes back down to around the three point five mark for the year. Now if that is true then we ought to be able to re- forecast a year getting a reasonable assessment, okay, on what's that going to do. So what I'm saying is that although there will be an overspend, it shouldn't be massive cos the overspend would effectively be the hump right at the beginning of the year. I don't think it's as simple as that because at the time that we were doing the budget, we were doing it really in September, and most of those other cate categories of work, apart from like auto-offs reports and things, weren't having an impact. And all, all the other things we've listed out that have taken up time of the team weren't being done in September. We were doing other things last year. We were doing other things. Loads of other things. I don't think I don't think simply by looking at auto- offs reports or E D S R work is going to solve our problems in time do you? But I don't I don't s No I haven't seen anything that, that actually says, suggests to me that you've got another, any other special cause between now and last autumn. Othe the only other thing that could be in there would be an increase in post, fundamentally. Which we haven't had. Which we haven't had. No. Well we might be having in, in March if eastern region's anything to go by, cos it's had a twenty four percent increase, then it might be a, a double blip, a blip under and a blip over, which would therefore f it would therefore follow that your erm your workload level is gonna be consistent. What we don't know is whether March is a start of a new trend upwards above budget, that's a different scenario cos then you can say okay, just like we talked about with claims and E W S. But if you take the, the servicing sections overall, what we should be able to say is that look okay we're gonna have a delayed kick in of improved productiv because it, productivity cos of new systems that are helping us, whether it moves us from two point six to two point seven to two point eight is arguable, and we won't know that for sure until we get there, but we shouldn't have is deterioration. I don't e I don't see any reason why we should have deterioration. Cos the work that the T As are doing now are just different projects to the one they were doing before. I mean you've had Sue, Sue for example tied up on and all those sort of issues, Bob 's been dealing with pr pension conversions and stuff like that for, for months on end, so we've been dealing with other projects, all that's happened is the work has been redirected onto a different type of project. Now we've lost a lot of resource erm in the clerical area, in this first quarter,t t to release people to go and do testing work we've taken on temps. Now the temps an and the two new business people for example have definitely had an impact on our ability to be as productive as you normally expect to be. That's why I would expect to see and we planned to some extent, we may have under-planned an increase in costs. But I don't see any reason why we shouldn't ever get back to where, to the last quarter, if you're excluding December, of ninety two. That should actually be our benchmark, I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to achieve that. Now the very simple thing is if we just stop doing this other project and get the T As back down on to, if, if we need to do that. But I don't see any reason why our that we shouldn't have the ability, as a man to making management decisions, that makes the productivity and cost profile achievable of at least what it was before Christmas. Now that's all I'm saying. Unless of course we have a significantly increased level of erm of post and then that changes the scenario quite again. Now we're planning to do a, we don't wanna do another budget, re-budget forecast until June July, we, cos it, we don't need to do one for this bu any budget year starting July, we're gonna work on the calendar year. Erm but one of the things that we, that we will need to do is actually to review the overtime for the last three months to say okay, what's it actually been spent on so that we can start to er make sure we've identified the reasons for it. If the reasons for it are accommodating the release of people to, like Pam, Lewis and Ron and people like that whom we've released, erm and the experienced temps then you can at least say when they come back then that position should revert back to the norm. So Some of that's been done though hasn't it? From what erm we did for yesterday. Mm. Some of it, things like the fax service I think which we certainly weren't doing, were we, in the last last year er review and the mechanics of the fax service we already thought that took up a lot of hours you know just putting, faxing them through, receiving them But then you, that outweighs No that ma that's saving us time the, the time wasted on phone calls doesn't it? Yeah. I mean at least when you're getting the faxes and it's being recorded as working there's an enquiry Mm we weren't convinced. When we worked it out as an average that the sheer monitoring and chasing quotes or following up quotes erm and just preparing the documentation, we weren't convinced that was the case at all. You'd expect the productivity to fall wouldn't you, if you were actually operating a fax service because you'd save, you'd take more time to monitor it Er yeah whereas the exact opposite's happened in west, the productivity on the section with the It can't. fax service has shot up, whereas the other one I think it should shoot up. operating a I do. normal service has gone down, so Mm. I don't see any reason why it, why it shouldn't do. Why it shouldn't improve it. Because A you're not wasting the time, you're not worrying about the post sort, you're getting the stuff quicker, you've got the thing logged in and logged out erm so to, to a great extent, I mean er we should be ab I personally think that we should actually s be trying s we should be expecting to see an advantage but let's just take that as as, as, as neutral so that you haven't got a er a worsening situation and you haven't taken adva taken advantage of any Mm er have any advantage in that. We're also running erm without, we must be running without or we've got a significantly reduced level of chase-ups because our turn- rounds are, in most areas, are significantly better than they were. And th and we've sustained that now for several months erm much more so than we did when we did the thing at the end of ninety one. Erm now okay I accept that erm what you're getting now or starting to get through in some areas is a higher degree of expectation, but if we're not achieving that then I think it's something to do with what we're, the way in which we're, we're operating rather than the fact that it isn't achievable. Mm. Okay? So all I'm saying is, if we're not achieving that we need to go back and look at the way in which we're operating the fax service, have a chat with erm Phil's people or Jackie's peo see if there's any differences that we can take advantage of. Are we er are we, you know, gilding the lily? If, cos if we are, we can't afford to. Yeah. It's as simple as that. Erm so I all we're trying to do now at the moment though is, is to, to operate from the point of view of saying look, if you actually take all these things into account, we shouldn't be worse than we were ultimately, once these systems have bedded in, we're doing more checking on letters for example th than, than we w we won't have to once we've checked through the first two months of auto-offs, and we're getting used to the new reports and so on and that sort of stuff, so we expect there to be a blip, but you would expect a learning curve in anyway. That's what I'm saying. So once we're through that we need to be able to say okay, if there is a significant shift in the mix of work, then we need to be able to quantify exactly what that is. Yeah. Okay? But I'd've thought that, that generally speaking, we should have been able to at least hold the line. Cos if we haven't then all of our assumptions into why we're doing things like auto-offs and it improves the outgoing costs and then we've got better reta better information and better screens and all that sort of stuff, I mean it blows every single assumption we've made in a way. You know that you've got, the fact that you can get current statements at the press of a button from July onwards, we should be able to say that means that on the teams that haven't gotta control the work going round to quotes and back again, having it typed and back again, Mm. there should be improvements in those areas. That, that should surely improve turnaround times. Which yeah which are already going down anyway It won't, it won't improve turnaround times generally speaking on the quotes area cos that's kept separate. Doesn't that affect teams? It will it will im Yeah cos improve the overall yeah. It will have an improvement but I, I think we get that almost for free. But it, well what it will do is it will actually mean that you haven't, shouldn't have to worry so much about keeping logs of what you've sent round and, and so on. Mm. So all I'm saying is that that's what we should expect to see. Now the r the truth is, what we've gotta now check out, is actually is that reality, is the reality wildly out. Cos if it is, how much are we gonna have to pay for it, and why and what can we do to try and bring it back in. And that's what we've gotta try and do in the next, next few weeks really. And monitor it very closely. Erm one interesting point about overtime and temps er generally is that temps apparently unl are costing us around about fourteen K with overheads which is a lot more than I believed to be the case. Er and Mark was saying to me yesterday Erm Mark was saying yesterday that, unless you're erm going to be getting overtime done erm by supervisors, in which case temps are cheaper, you're better off using overtime er clerical staff than you are getting temps in. So it's, if you're overtime is at the grade C level, or the workload is at the grade C level, then you're bet it's cheaper to get overtime done than it is to get temps. That's the agency temps I presume? All temps according to Mark. There will be the very few exceptions. Should we not also still go for the, if we can, the one and a half times they work Saturdays? That'll make it even cheaper, instead of double time. No well what we said is we're gon gonna scrap Saturdays unless we s consider it to be critical and unavoidable on the basis that, if they, they can work Saturdays if they'd rather work Saturdays than in the week, but that's their choice not ours But then they get pa they do it get paid for time and a half. Yeah Right. Is, that's the decision from now on is it? Well we, we're saying that now are we? Yeah, I think we should say that, well really, unless we've got anything scheduled in the next week or two, let's get them out the way Does that apply to E W S as well? We've got, we've got two in er April April. Well then let's fill in April, then I think we should actually make sure that we're comfortable that is essential and th that there is overtime being worked there that couldn't have be worked in the week. You know I mean okay talking vast I mean there's the argument I know people vary with their opinions but is it more productive on a Saturday? I think Yeah that's the way mine tend to think it's more productive on a Saturday. I think so. Mine are exactly split. Some think it's a waste of space and others think, you know, it's er Well in er I think you've gotta weigh up the p the productivity element against the cost, cost of it. cost effectiveness I think it must be easy to plan mustn't it if you know you've got that top number of hours from looking at what you've got What essentially what you need to do how to do is if you wanna be able to work Saturdays we need to be able to prove that in fact pound per, per item of post on a Saturday is cheaper than because the productivity in the week will be lower therefore and even at time and a half, the cost of doing an hour's overtime for the work you get out in the week is, is less productive than doing double time with what you get out on a Saturday. If that can be proved then we've got a case. If it isn't then what we should then be saying is no week time over no week time work and just all work Saturdays if you see what I'm getting at. If we can actually demonstrate that, but you've gotta see a significant improvement in your productivity on a Saturday to make it worth your while. But I think it does doesn't it? By the volumes Yeah Prove it. they produce. Yeah. Well we've got plans, Mark you know produced plans with productivity for Saturdays alone. In which case then we should be able to say that Saturday working costs X X pounds per item, and in the week it costs Y pounds per item. If X is cheaper than Y then you've got your case. Then you ban the weekday overtime. Is there certain work there that has to be done during the week and can't wait till the weekend? It will just come down to organization really won't it? Between the teams. Well I think it's an important issue, we need to sq we need to squeeze every, every pound out that we can if we're not to if we're not to affect our service level. But the o the one thing I wanna say is that erm we need to do all we can to keep the c the over-run down to as low a figure as possible, and that's our job. Bob's already indicated that he doesn't, he wants to do everything he possibly can to avoid us having to affect service levels okay, and obviously the overtime is the one thing that really is, stands out as being the issue anything else cos I mean our salary costs are there, there or thereabouts erm with the temps in it, erm we know we've got erm some temps. One of the issues is we're not quite sure whether we've got a change in our planned spend, which is what makes the, the comparison against budget look as bad as it currently does, or whether in fact we genuinely are gonna over-run significantly. So what does that mean with us doing with overtime at the moment then? Sorry? Cos we're, we're averaging what, two hundred hours per team per month? Mm. Well I think you, you, you've got, well you've got, if you're gonna work overtime, you've got to make sure that your productivity justifies it. That it isn't just to catch up with unproductive people. Yeah I'll ask supervisors to do everything by batch as opposed to allowing X number of hours, but then on top of that, saying alright you've got thirty hours this week Mm sure. allocate it how you want. Yeah. I think it does mean though that issues like erm long term sickness erm the issue that you've got with the two people in your patch, one of whom might go to the help desk, you need to get that resolved P D Q so you can say well I've reduced my h the temp over budget by one. Okay? So that then we can actually get somebody in there that can do the job properly. And then we'll have to deal with that other one and er and, and resolve that one way or the other and make, make sure we've done that reasonably reasonably quickly, either g sending her back to new business or er trying to find another position for her if she can't actually cope with that. Mm. Erm the J C one we'll have to try and deal with that again as a separate issue but I don't, I mean the amount of time we're losing from high levels of sickness we talked about a c couple of meetings or so ago, about the absence levels with some people, we've just gotta make sure we crack that on the head, we're just haemorrhaging money, the fact that it is not just hours it's money. We should be getting another one out soon shouldn't we, end of March? Yeah there's no reason why you can't ask Trudy for an update now, you don't have to wait for Tr for Trudy's report. If you want updates on those key individuals then let's get some. But let's make sure we, we can make, make a k key point of that. Did you do anything with the erm names we gave you for nil absence? For nil absence? No I haven't done anything with that yet. Erm we, we can do. Is that over ninety two? Well over the the Since the last calendar year from It was last year wasn't it? during ninety two. Yeah. So what are we doing on the overtime then, Saturdays, at the moment? I Are we gonna go away and work out how much it is? Yeah I think, I think what wh er you do need to have worked out in, in your own minds and justified it what your plans are in terms of u realizing the extra resource whether it be by temp or by overtime. But the w clearly, in, in budget terms, we haven't got any left for the rest of this year now clearly then we that means we're gonna overspend. The question is by how much. Now But we have to keep in mind that we're not gonna let service levels deteriorate so We don't wanna l no. But I think, but I do think it does mean that the first thing we say is that the work is more important than some of, maybe some of the, the nicer to have three year projects at the moment. And that's gonna have to be some of the things that suffer. If for example you've got a problem with productivity in your patch, erm because of the, the reasons we've talked about, it does mean that perhaps you need to say to whoever has been, is off and doing other projects that they'll have to stop doing that until you've got the productivity up till you can release them back again. I think they'll have to recognize that it's gonna be roll your sleeves up and we're go we aren't gonna be able to do all of the things we wanted to Also erm It's no problem but polystyrene plastics are are very good crystals. Yeah. We're not using polystyrene anyway. There's a thirty three in there. Ah, ha ha ! Uses thirty five mill ? Wah ah oh oh oh Oh. . It's definitely a thirty five. . What would use thirty three Norm ? Yeah, well it's small.. Yeah. Erm He's trying to think. Must have updated the crystals then? It's I think I might have erm used thirty three on the crystals and now the shape's been updated. And there's nothing particularly unusual on that. Crystal's would be erm one eighths And the veers What about the veers? They're quite small. These are twenty fives aren't they? These are twenty , yeah. These are twenty, yeah. Thirty threes, thirty seven forty six, so well thirty threes must be the crystals, thirty fives I don't see what they're gonna be. er sha What letter are you er Oh I'm not worried about the letters at the moment. Just got it sitting in Well it's never had that before, I'm just trying to work out where it's come from. Can't you do a a select? Name select or something and pick out a one of the pads with that hole? No, you can't, there's erm I see. You haven't got anything unusual that's gonna be small. No. Oh I've got a thirth three hold iron or on the er crystals look. Yeah, alright. Tha , that's probably a mistake in the past before we had all this changing. Right. I'll define Cos now we've gone up to thirty fives, I'm pretty sure. Just er They're both the same footprint, those two Sorry? These two are the same footprint. Yeah. What about that one there? Bedge? Oh that's cute! Oh ah Who got that one? Little one there. I think they should all be er I know what it could be! I know what it is! We know what it is. Er What a , what are Zener diodes called, shape? Which ones? Jus Just a normal Zener. It's not on there but Oh erm It's on the back. R four, no D D three over four sixty? Is that a normal , a normal Zener one, Z is is in some ways. I think it uses the same footprint doesn't it? Yeah. Oh hang on, let's let's let's do it the easy way. It's very quick. Two, three and a so sixty that's good innit? Whoops! And si , six, six, six, six, six, six. I bet you pound of thirty fives cos that's a new one machine. That's a new component I put on there and that would be updated , yeah. there. That's what it is. So all the thirty two's have gotta be changed to thirty fives. Well , is it thirty three, or thirty five. Thirty five rings a bell, erm . Oh, find out . I can't find an easy one can I? I could look at the library can't I? Yep. Cos I know they're all up to date. You know the check that went in? Mhm. Something vague with this split window innit in? See if they're in the same file and two different bits two places on the file. It's doing code and you need to change several entries or something. Mm mm. Just split your window. Brilliant! I'm not with you. Well if you've got a big file right? And you're changing all your currencies of a certain variable Yeah. you can have it at the top where you've changed it and then the window underneath you can scan it through the file again. Alright? Brilliant! Nice though. You pick them . Can't you just do a find? Can you Find and replace. wait five minutes? Yeah, you probably can. Cos I've got something to take over, you might as well take them over . Can you find the ye , if is there any yellow pads about? We've gone right out. I'll pick up somewhere. Er, yellow pads? You know the you pull out the information. So what were you up at lunchtime then? Thirty seven is a different one altogether again isn't it Norm? Hang on! Make that the same After you call the same symbol alright? I make it the same size okay? I wouldn't of thought there's sod all difference between thirty three and thirty seven. No. Yeah, but you have to tell it. I'm not ready Norm! Cos it sees both of those holes in the data range. Oh ya! Hey, I saw this bird Norm Yeah. Yeah. That Justin's trying to er Pull pull. but he says he isn't! Don't laugh! He's completely ignoring me now! Now I've seen him interfering with the smoke alarm now! Thought that was quite remarkable! Oh you know that we were talking about What she look like? working here from the pub. Dear oh dear oh dear! Yeah. Still soaring in he with that? What a halibut ! E any good for a titty wank No, no good for a titty wank No, totally bare! A titty wank ! We used to call it breast fucking but that's much nicer! No, too Tha , that's too descriptive. titty wank All calls for a Titty wank tea break and I like that, I like the er the phrasing. Titty wank Titty wank Did you have a titty wank over the er weekend now your wife's back? Ah! No? Not big enough mate! No, nor is that, bloody right ! What the tits or er Well if it was if mine was small I'd be alright on mine. Ah well! Titty wank, I like that ! It's one of the funniest things I've heard for Oh, minutes! Micro-seconds!

Leave the room. It's alright bu get off your high horse! I was just gonna say why? No. Well I don't know. I reckon that Daniel's . Might be. Has he had a bad appraisal then or something. I dunno. Dunno. Kevin had one. Well Kevin's a wanker! His . Erm Well give us a shape to look at then. Can't I get. Sorry? Come on! How long you gonna be? Not long. Z three over four sixty? Good grief!

Have you Bedge! erased that layer? Yeah it's all gone now. Sorry I'll get the old Thirty three paint pot. Thirty three is the oscillator Right it should be thirty three. Well that's what they use in the library so that's a I'll make sure the library ones are correct on mine, alright? What are the other oscillators? Thirty five is point nine. That should be point eight five. Should it? Yeah. So it should be dip , thirty three and Yeah. What's the other oscillator, that one that's you lie flat An eighteen osc or something. It's H C eighteen. H C eighteen. Alright, we're gonna have to do a well hard copy here. Oh shit! That means we're gonna have to rebuild that bloody Hang on! Zoom in. No I think the I think they're there. You might find they're with the scrap. Okay. It's it's no problem. It's found it all has it? Yeah, should of picked it all up. That's right. I gotta rebuild this anyway. What a bugger! Yeah, the erm small oscillator is a thirty three as well. Alright. Ah ha ! So there is a difference between thirty three and thirty five? Correct! Looks that way. I'm gonna delete this one. Although saying that one we sent out to erm Yeah. they actually drew the wall at point nine Or point nine five. oscillated everything. The pads are big enough to take it but when we a , you know that, when we had that problem about the er what's a name coming up? Yeah. The solder coming up, we decided we'd go down to what size it should be. Yeah. Thing is the th The bulk of the drawing rules were such that you got the pin diameter plus you know, their size pads and all this and stuff. Yeah. So we basically done to what that is although they said they were just gonna dri , drill a one point nine five Mm. and sort of run it from there. Well it's a strange fault cos Very. Very! They make a big thing about some things, and then some we're gonna drill all that point nine five anyway! Yeah. They made a big thing about us sort of not using one millimetre holes using Mm. point nine five holes, cos that's standard size But that's that's sod all! Yeah. We wouldn't have used one mill on the sc for out side counters and letters they said oh no, they were gonna use wha you know er what's a name? Mr Point nine five. Yeah. Mr was well upset! Phylis?

Excellent! So a hundred and fifty we don't use and, you've already defined that E and F will be the same Yeah. on here? What you'll have to do in here right, because E and F you'll still have to have E and F alright? But quoted as the same size alright? Well E and F on here is er thirty three. Oh right, sorry! That's I me , erm F and H. Make them both point nine five then. Well ho is this is E and F, thirty three, thirty five, how come we got point eight five and point nine?

This is in millimetres and this is in millime no this is in . They're all in . And this is in mill Right. We got it all written down look. Okay, right, so point five is twenty, which you've got right? As long as your drill template tallies with this alright? And you don't miss out any letters that occur except for the L, right?

Post box is just outside here on the er Come out and go these go right just down there is a postbox on the left hand side. Just past What off-site? Yeah. And they pick up about five o'clock. Well there's various post boxes on the way home. Bless you! Mark! Mark, don't sneeze any more! Alright? So is better er tested by girls? They give us more work. Yeah I bet! I'll have a word with him. Don't forget push him to . Yeah. have a wank isn't he? Sure!. Cheers Ron! That it's been taken away. Yep! Therefore, on the Web it says, completed! Yep! The er people that pay the bills say oh well that's no good to us! What is the use of having this wonderful Well I Web system Well when they don't fucking look at it! It's supposed to be Well how do they know? for everybody on site. Precisely! The whole system is But they're a , they're a law smooth running. unto themself! They still want a paper system! They still want me to send paper work to say it. Which we do all that anyway, always do. They're fucking useless! No! Wha what happens if the good come from the store? You don't have to do any paper work do we? I do! What's that for? What's Tough! that for? Circuit boards and tough! No, you get paperwork from there. Yeah but I know! surely that system of paperwork shuffling is is gonna come to end with this. Well it bloody should do! Is it because well the whe whe when they the good they come from internal store Yeah. they that are sent over or what? Oh I dunno! I will just fill out what she wants me to do. They'll probably end up paying twice for it. Because I recko , I reckon they must of been paid for that because Maury hasn't been phoning up and saying oh you haven't paid it! They've obviously ! Yeah. She usually pho phones you up about a month afterwards, you know there is a sort of a problem. I'm pretty sure we must have paid it cos I'm sure she would have phoned us. Cos it's got my name on there. She'd know it was me who got it. Well it's not one of these weirdos! . What? You wanna do it like this one though. Yes. Mm, fucking right! Yeah, you're telling me! But , you said you only wanted four lines! Yeah I know but if I have, say if I have six lines Yeah, well you then just go and change them for that one drawing! You can't see with the th the colour,a better colour. Like black or Ah! No, transparent's better innit? Yeah. You sure your right? I'm sure you got some That's okay, they're all pins. No, not pins, erm veers and veers aren't a problem. You can check with the governor! Small boy! Small boy says it's okay. Ah! Oh God! Fucking move them to those! Ah,lol lol lol lol Oh ! Problems, problems, problems! Oh er! Right where are they? Okay. Why don't you do a Mark . Here to here, forget it! Now, if I click on there and see it Delete it you've got now, but forget it. We're not worried about that. If I erase it I lose the veer Ah, cos there's an extra vire there is there? Yeah. But it stops short and the other one overlaps it. Ah, leave it then. Yeah, I mean it's silly things really. Yeah, leave it. Undo. I don't know why erm We should of done these before we erm Out of the book . Yeah, but leave it. That's cos you had a sort of go at it. Yeah, if there's another re-work we'll sort these out to re-wire. Tha that's why I'm a bit concerned about messing around s straightening and that sort of thing, cos I'm sure I've had this problem before I'm sure that it reduces a lot of er Yeah, but you've still gotta do it. You still gotta move stuff around ain't you? Yeah, well what I do is I delete it Tidy it up. Yeah. and then I draw back in. Cos afterwards Yeah, but then if you run this your ri Yeah but , I think if you straighten lines and mess around with them too much it leaves little bits in underneath the other one. Yeah but there's not a lot of difference in the amount of time is there? By the time you've you've moved them all rather than drawing them all in again then you run the con activity and swop back. Cos you're gonna have to run con activity anyway. Well it's just down here with the plate And another thing is to is to to run con activity before you output the plot. Yeah. But a little short thing like that isn't gonna hurt is it? No. Leave that. Right. Okay. Er, what else is there? There is , that's the er crystal. Yep! That's good! That's right. Which had been forced. Yep. I'll just show you what was on there before. See they're not fully connected. No. Move back. Right, okay, let's have a look. It looks okay. Better colour, alright? Er, so which one shall we . Yeah. dunnit? I can't see anything wrong with it to be honest. Signal feed back is non-reflectives. Is it because this package has been messed around with? And that thing should be a a bra , a main No. pin? No? Right! Interesting! Right, I'll show you this. Hang on sec , I'll just look in Right, it's here right not fully connected right? Now Yeah. the problem here is between this point here right? Which is one of them, and I'll go over there, this is one of them. So the thing is And there. Yep. There right? And There. there. So it's between it's just on that bit there? Yeah, and also this S this bit here, which which I was Signal being traced, three nine four thousand. That blue trace there and this blue trace here it says there's a problem stubbing it. If you mark it, delete it and re-draw Yeah. there's not another one underneath. So I dunno why it's causing a problem really. Stubs in signal. It's not a trace, that those co- ordinates it's Bib bib Sorry, can I just interrupt? Mark darling, have you Barbara's address in Felixstowe? I was looking for the same thing yesterday ! Were you? Yeah. Cos I er you know she sent a thing, well I you know you sent the thing with the address and I Yeah. well I lost it! Okay. I had to get si , see I was gonna give it to you.

Not that I don't trust him or anything! I think what it is Yeah. I don't think, when you draw this trace perhaps it went just over the pin and didn't click it down. Ah, but when it's actually done it'll be connected won't it? Yeah. . Aha. I'd like to get this out the way really cos then I can get on to something else.

Go on. Little window up here right? The thing about co-ordinates why? You get a little cross in that window Mm. then zoom. Oh isn't that lovely! Look! you can see it's That's lovely! Cos what I tend to do is I do a full board there find out Yeah. where it is and then zoom. Yeah. So you've, actually saving Clicked up on the C N C. Yeah, just turn all items off in that window all full board right? And then, what a so, you get a huge star there you just zoom around about erm Isn't that lovely! and you're there. And can you zoom off? Experience mate! Can you zoom in on that window then? Or is that always full board No it's type window? it's exactly the same window as this, you can edit in it, you can do everything. It should go past the window. So how do you how obviously you do you have the cursor in here when you hit zoom? Yeah. And then you go in there. And then yo , you edit box in there. If you had it in there it would actually zoom that way? Yeah , I mean if you go erm if I go zoom here right? And then, quickly here That does that, right. Right? But then if I go zoom in here Oh I see. and I go into that pad, say Single level three. and you can't see it cos I got all items on but Yeah. you just get a picture of that pad there So the all items on and off are completely separate from the two windows? Yeah. And is on? Yep! Wonderful! I like that! It's just one of those little things you learn when you working on as many bloody years as I've been now! No, I've never used an extra window. Yeah. I ha , I do in Ace but not in Bullmaster It's just a good way to mark it. But ones like this to me, I think they're cos if at you. Yeah. You know. Yeah, you were Looked like you were gonna fall off your chair. Yeah.. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! He's Er behind you! So I said, you know I didn't want to know. But I wanted to know, people dead weird and anyway it turned out, do you believe in ? I think so, yeah. Cos I'm sick of telling people that don't believe in it and I feel a complete Right. turd! So Okay. So what happened? But erm it turns out that's what they were. I really a word, and they had a little chat to us. Mm. Well About what? People About the people who are dead? Oh! Oh! About They weren't trying to get you to and, about the you know,th yeah Yeah. Well I because I'm the one who was da doing that because tha I mean I was . But, he was horri the guy that was doing me didn't know he had a pair of a like off er yeah. He was built a bit like Jack. And he had a white T-shirt, pair of jeans, a beer belly and tattoos up his arms. And he was the one Who's the kind of person with ! Exactly! We went into this room and there was this music playing like on the erm like John Indian music. would play on the Oh no. on erm Like in fantasy Yeah. John's sort of thing. You know water a blue light bulb in the middle of the room and I'm thinking, Oh! Come on! What are letting yourself in for? You know. But it was just I mean, the things that they said honestly weird. They're good aren't they? Did I tell you once that a nurse on erm radiotherapy did my psychometry? Yeah. Did I tell you? Yeah. I remember you said. Well this, did I, didn't I tell you? Yeah. Oh sh I've definitely heard this one. What was that? She was holding my fob watch and she said a few things about this, and about us and about dead people and She was closer to you and things like Yeah. that. Yeah. Well this guy, he went Yeah. Oh! the same person was there with exactly the same message. Cos she said what happened was he said Was she fed up? Dunno. He'd already got the message and met someone else ! It's a him. It's a him. They'll not let, let somebody else have a turn ? Well it was, what happened right, I'll tell you the whole story from the very beginning. But basically, the man that, you know, my father said to me well he said to where's the horses? He says I'm getting horses all the time. And of course my Aunty Annie, Gwenny went and he says is it you? I said, well could be. Well, you know He said just everything that was happening, I kept getting horses. And anyway, he said to me he says is there a man in the spirit world close to you? No! So I just thought of my granddad. And I said, yeah, but I was very sort of non-committal Non-committal. Yeah. and very, well I suppose Yeah. kind of Could be. attitude. Could be. Erm, cos I just thought he was guessing, you know, and he said he says, I didn't see him, he said I only saw him and pointed to this girl over the other side of the room he was standing beside you when you were in the chair. Oh no! He says I'll get her to come over and have a chat with you. And she came over after Did she describe him? Aha. So who was it? My dad's granddad. His name Oh no! and everything. His physique, his erm his physical appearance, his character and why he was there and it's exactly what that Merv said off radiotherapy. Mm mm. Why was he there? There's something I've got to do. I need a bit of a push to do it. But there's something that you want to achieve, there's something you've got to do Got to make a jumper. get on and do it. Qualify this. That is exactly what it's not. Yeah. It's your riding. Well that's what everybody says. Yeah. Or it's having a baby. Well I don't think it is. It's probably getting married. It's getting married, yes . I don't think it is. Well what's your main I thi main ambition in life? I think it's to do my riding exams but, I ca as I said, cos Brenda whose horse I ride up at Bridley I was telling her and I said, why would the spirit world get in such a state About riding exam. about me doing riding exams? He said he said which wo what would happen if you got your riding exam when you qualify nursing? I said well I'll probably choose Yeah. riding. I wouldn't know. He said well really for some reason you ought not to be a nurse. I mean, you know how th if you believe in fate and is, is there any control over it or Yeah. is it all planned out for you and Mm. and this kind of thing, is, is someone trying to steer your care or your, the rest Away from of your life? away from something. Which it would be. Away from something. So I don't know, I mean, I'm very open-minded, I mean Oh yeah. but erm he described a, my mum told her everything about a fall the bump on her head, he knew Oh. just loads of things. Very strange. I found that research book. Doesn't Jane look yellow? What? D'ya think Jane looks a bit yellow? I've probably got reflection off her . I know. See if any of us look,ta talking about yellow. Mm. Mm. So? So it was very good. I dunno if I would go to one now. Well I, I want to go now, to er, erm and just try one of the other ones. Tonight I'm gonna go the open circle. I wish I could go. I, I would go, but I'd be frightened to stay there. Well I am whe So am I. see what happened is, I came over and he says, you know I've told this lady that you saw the man standing beside her and she went she sort of, she described him, apparently he was very tall which Yeah. we knew wasn't my granddad cos my granddad was knee high to a grasshopper, erm straight as a dye in character and physical appearance, er like he had a rod up his back which was one of these expressions, Oh! I see. which apparently he was. Obviously I've never met him. I don't think my dad even met him. Yeah. And then she said erm she said, and I suppose she turned to the other guy, she said, we're not supposed to do clairvoyants, like, laughing, you know. And he says, ah, go on it's the end. Cos the all the was over. And then he actually went into a A trance? well not a trance, it was just so normal. She tho she was doing this right as she spoke Like Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost? No! Oh. Dead normal! She, she was going like, you're me and I'm her Ha. and she was standing, I was sitting like, she was standing, she sort of went can you take a Lesley? I went yeah. She says, not in the spirit world. Can you take a what? Lesley. And I said well, yeah and I've got a cousin Lesley . And then nothing more was said about that. And then she was going there's something you need to do. She was literally having a two-way conversation, although, not in an odd way, not going ooh! Ooh! Ooh! You know? She was just like talking to herself, she's going Yeah. and then she would turn her attention back to me. Mm. Oh! How strange! And described him and She thinks she his name. might be going on Wednesday. And Lyndsey might be able to tell you something. Well I know. Well that's what I'm thinking. I'll go, my sister's going with us and I'll, the following Wednesday I'll tell you what it's like. Right. Right. Okay. Come with us. Then we'll go and see the district nurse on Wednesday, is there anything you want me to say? But it's not real But I don't, what if I don't know things? Then I might spend the rest I know. of my thinking I know. It's just that you won't that hasn't happened yet. Well, if you're that sort of person, I would worry about them you see. Now Yeah. someone said to me, I know not, not like an accident or death or anything, but someone said erm you don't have any sisters or something? I would imagine, in my mind, that something's gonna happen to my sisters for her not to be able to see it. I was just thi I remember when I was young I thought my mum went to a fortune teller and, and I had there like tears running Oh! Oh . And she told us we were gonna move to a house with a green door . And did you? My mum bottled out when we got there. Well Bet your there must be a . the thing, the thing that erm worries me is in case I go over is, that you say You're not gonna have any children. you're gonna have two marriages. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's right, you know. Because someone told Tony's mum that Tony would be married twice and the second marriage would be very happy. But then you'd taken that to be that first woman, that Gill person, Gill Yeah Yeah. somebody. Yeah. But that's it. You will really But if they say to me, I'll be marri I'm just gonna be thinking oh my God! But you will relate it, cos no matter what they say you will relate it. Yeah. will be along after this. Keep the noise down thank you. not here. Right. Moving swiftly along er, the little thing on the timetable you know for the the last session where it says quiz it's not really a quiz. It was at the end of the the module. But what we are gonna do is, is give out your study guides and the areas that we'll be revising. We'll do it now. While you're I don't think I'm even gonna bother revising for this. I'm not. Will it be a multiple choice or a written or a Oh yeah. And do I have to ? I think, I think so. A mixture I suppose. Well I can't be A mixture. bothered. Is it serious? Is it like a Serious ? Well it's for yo for your benefit. It's no one 's but . must have all this studying won't they? Don't worry about it. What do you use to chew in Ooh! This looks a little bit less ? doesn't it? What colour is an orange ? What do what is this last thing you have er according to you? Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! What? Not like who was that man's enemies and things like that. Like the last one. Name the se dwarfs or what they're called? Yeah. Name the seven dwarfs. And certain parts are The false formastation and things. No! That was stupid that! And I got it wrong. You got it wrong? What was that? Blooming stupid question! It was the way it was phrased. Oh, so expulsion of of sperm. And it was, it was something. And it was ejaculation But I thought it was masturbation. Well I thought it was the forced Yeah. Well, it's funny, I was telling Stephen, my boyfriend, about that, and I was telling him the question and he said Yeah. that. Oh. Well Geoff laughed at me when I told him. He said, er bloody typical! Yeah but don't he said . We want a break now. The stupid old bag hasn't looked at it! I've got a headache. That's June . Determined to sort but she's gone now. No, it's not. That's June . She is, cos I lent her th you know. I know. That's what I was thinking. Well they're not the same are they? No. I had to take Tony to the casualty on Saturday? Why? Got a crack on the side of his head at rugby. And he, he, er and his hearing went. Ah! Ah! And he was feeling a bit back taken. Mm. Is he alright? He's got i he's got a card with I have had a recent head injury. Signs to look for. Ah! Oh! Please report immediately. Who? Tony. Tony. Has he? What happened to him? He got a knock on on Saturday. But I think it was when he was tackling and erm ? got a cra no he didn't black out. And he says, but he got like a crack on the side of his head and his hear Oh! On his head? and his hearing went Any questions about that guide? so I had to take him Was it bad that ? Was it the R V I or the General? No. Was it bad? I'll sho oh I'll show ? Yes. well he's er, he says he's done a big X-ray. Mm. This is your study guide. Work your way through the guide and you're going to answer all the questions on the quiz. As usual, the papers are taken and they're kept in the file for yo reference by your personal tutors. The reason that we're gonna produce biological science quizzes is they're, it's from your feedback evaluations that you don't get enough biological science. Soon put right. Not a lot more I can say to you is there? Oh I know. Yeah. I never said that. believe it or not. There's about sixty percent I might have said that. of the people who are at the end of a said they didn't get enough. We haven't had enough biological science. So that'll teach us to . didn't want the sixty percent. the little areas as well though. You do need to have a basic knowledge of Yeah. biological science to understand Unfortunately you didn't have to do the . Providing you have . Would you agree? Yeah. Anybody dares Yeah. to disagree? No. Right. Very sensible. Cos Jane doesn't wanna be on the . Now the nasty erm half past seven session sorted out. What can, what can we do for another three hours ? I re I think we'll go and I'll think you just go for tea and come back in Yeah ! Four and a half an hour. we've got. Good God! You can have ti be back at half past three. Okay? Is this like coffee time? Or is this like This is a coffee break. You know,. So I need to know what time we'll be finished. We would've been revising had we not been here. Exactly! Oh! I'm going to watch the end of Neighbours anyway. Yeah. I would have seen erm I'm not gonna see it. What am I gonna do! It's very important you know! For my wellbeing isn't it? Set the video. For my wellbeing . Anyway, she's lost the battle Wouldn't that do it? Watch what episode you put on. I know. Do we have any idea what time we'll be finished? Cos I've gotta phone my ? When Carole finishes when Carole finishes in this session I'm gonna go and have a chat with her. Because what we'll have to do is negotiate at the end of the next session, whenever we've finished, cos that's entirely dependent on when we get fed up varies on what When we run out say, I mean, you know, what your response to the session is. But usually it finishes within an hour and a half the next session. Which might Right. well finish at five o'clock. Right. Five o'clock. Right. And then i then it's time for a break again. Now I think we've gotta be careful, if we cut out the breaks, you see Aha. an awful lot of people saying let's work right through you're not affective, you're not learning No. if you No. haven't gone away No. and had No. a break.

But you know about, typical woman. families have sex before marriage. Well a how many people though Alison? Not very many. Someone in my hairdressers were talking about it.

I say I'm sure, did she not get the eighty percent in the open book exam? She's got lovely hair! Mm! Got something about her personal appearance as well! She's got nice hair Jan. I think she's got nice hair. Yeah but she does well in her exams so Don't you think these things are important? What that you've got lovely hair? No, that you do well in your exams. No, that you do well in your exams . Denise isn't interested in her hair really. No. She was only saying it as a balance. No. I was gonna ask her where she gets her hair done actually. Well that's right. She's got a bit of money there. She lives down there. By herself? Those with the bay windows? Yeah. Yeah. Tt. Along that row, she's, her dad They're very nice. her mum died of cancer. She lives with Ah! Ah! her dad. Mm. How old is she? And she got a younger sister. Twenty. Oh! Oh!there. I says to her, you bloody well do that then! Can you take the ? Four hour . Beg your pardon? Er, shut up! Don't forget you said this is still . I didn't say that. Yes you are. They will tell you. What? And then we won't know when we go. I'm getting a bit spooked about this exam now. I am. I keep suddenly thinking of the enormity of it. And th the fact that I haven't really revised. At least you, you are in the same place. I keep thi I keep sitting down to it and thinking God! There's so much I haven't done for this exam. As usual, I should have started ages ago. But I found when I looked at my books a week ago, or a fortnight ago, I thought, oh I know this, I know this, but it's not until you get into it that you think shit! I don't know this and I could be learning. A week ago I didn't know what to learn and now there's so many things that I know I want to learn. Mm mm. Well every time, every time we come in and she mentions, have you done this, that Yeah. and I think Can I have one of them things? I know. You. You. What? Fizzy gum balls. Oh. She always does. Get one of them I'll get one It's only funny when Pardon you! Thi a I have to say that she does it all the time and she goes, looks around. Does it . A girl I used to work with at the Beechams did like really big burps. I'd say she ate about anything and like pardon me. She would . My grandma's like that. Horrible! I mean she wo she says pardon me or excuse me, but it's so matter of fact that I'd be I could never burp like that if I tried, you know. She did a big, I went in the kitchen at at work on Friday and Saturday What time, what time have we gotta, do we have to be back? Twenty past. And the, the chef's were squeezing the custard carton and it was going cos it was the last and the Custard? You mean they don't make their own custard? Nah! They don't make anything man. Tt! And they were squeezing it out of the carton and it was making this right farty noise. I'm not kidding, the three of them,thir thirty odd year old one of them is, they were on the Well I've been floor laughing! One was going, the other ha ha ha! The custard's going My dad's forty And I'm thinking three and he still How old? does things Do you not like that though. do you not laugh when a squeezy bottle does it? No. Oh! I think it's so funny ! I mean, it's funny like when you burp because you get, embarrass you like. Oh no, it makes me laugh. And there's loads of people round about me and I just went wurgh! And I'd like to be fined . I hate people that erm when my dad burps, if, if it was a cup he'd go excuse me, but but it's when they go I hate that! I do. Cos I don't. I'll conceal a burp, no matter where I am. Well you don't obviously ! Well that er popping out. someone really. You could tell I didn't know it was coming. You can tell it was but make Geoff makes him burp. Oh no! I don't. Cos he feels he's got a wind so he Oh I can't force myself. Nor can I. Aargh. What was that? Oh. When's Tony coming for you tonight? I said half past seven. If we finish before then I shall be very annoyed! They said eight o'clock, quarter to. Quarter to eight cos they started at quarter to six. I could just sleep. Just feel like I'm not learning anything . I know. But then the thing is, Exactly. so I'm not learning anything and then we're to . What have I done all day? I know what . in the past two days. It's like what I said to Tony last night when I got in I said, I feel I could have achieved more if I'd stayed at home and revised. Yeah! I could of. He said but,yo you wouldn't of. I said well I would of that's the whole point. I would have revised all afternoon. I know. Anne was saying when Anne she was revising I've never seen No that was right. The whole . . Sorry I didn't offer anybody cos No that's alright. Oh. And I, when she's revising she says oh I've just done about change and theories of change. Who? Theories of change. But we started with Fred and only got Have you remembered that? a third of a ye way through it. Change in the N H S. Change, do you know what change she's talking about? Freezing, something when er a liquid is freezing and it changes when it is you know changes in the physical sense of the Yeah. word. That's what they learn about. I said oh that's what I've got then. Cos I'm talking about change in the N H S is all we can put down. Here's Anne. But then it's just how bad it. Oh! I wish we'd just done that . It's so, simplified. So basic, so logic. I mean, what do we need about planning something? We don't need it. I mean, I didn't understand much to be honest anyway. I wasn't listening cos I was writing them down. The thing is, with this I don't think half the people listen to you're meant to know you're meant to, in these exams you're meant to have everything you should know and everything else That's it. I'm sitting writing notes and I'm thinking am I ever gonna look at these again? Cos every time I have an exam it's a exactly the same things. I have got revision cards coming out of my ears! And erm which I'll never look at again at all. We're all looking very sorry for ourselves. Well what relevance is it to me? Is not I know. I'm not gonna be a nurse anyway. And I'm gonna go away next, next weekend aren't I? Tony said I need to do some exercise late at night. Cos I annoy him. Because as soon as I go upstairs I'm wide awake. Mm mm. He says you should go, go jogging or something late at night. I said well if you got us a dog I'd have to take it for a late night walk wouldn't I? Come jogging with me. Do you fancy coming jogging? What? Last thing at night? Yeah. You go first thing in the morning. I know but I can go at night as well. No, what, do you play squash? What like eleven o'clock? I don't, I've never played it but I'd certainly like to but I wanna play again. I play Mm. He says it's very unusual, you never see me like this . Ooh! I quite fancy doing that. We should have done. You know I was thinking today I was thinking today erm there's a horse Sorry. Say that again. there's a horse erm in some of the fields just coming out of Morpeth towards Newcastle and I saw, pardon me as I was on the bus like yesterday coming into Morpeth and this horse just shot out of nowhere and it was really enjoying itself! It was like galloping along ! as if it was racing. Yeah. Yeah! It was just like this ! And then it thing and it came, it was really galloping towards the fence and then, cor! Right up Yeah. to the fence. It stuck a All of a sudden. And I was looking, I was thinking, oh! To be free like that. Mm. And then today when I was passing it was just munching away in the corner, you know. And I was thinking, tt, it must nice, Alison's got a hobby she can just go out and you know, do it to get away Shall I tell you what it is, sometimes from everything. I go back from , I'm driving over to Brenda's and I'm thinking,, and I really am, I'm driving along, you know like wha when you're in the car by yourself and everything's turning over in your head Mm. and go and I tack up the horse and I get on the horse and everything and I don't mean to say Falls away. I'm drifting through the countryside cos No. it might be and I'll go over the level crossing I'll think, ooh that was a bit you know, things like that and then we'll see another horse in the field and Canter goes, ooh ooh it's all so everything Mm. it's, it's, it's on a different level, it really is. And because you could, you could just like ride away and not come back ever. Even when you come back you feel much better. You feel, oh I really enjoyed that. And it's a different kind of enjoyment, but, I mean I've never played squash Do you feel like that when you run? Well, well it must be the same. Or like when I, if I we say maybe, now I can't imagine feeling like that except with horse riding, but I suppose you do, whatever your thing is. That's it. It is. Er I wish I had a hobby or a outside interest. It has to be outside I think. Definitely. Yeah. Outside outside. That's it. I suppose Suppose like the riding. everyone feels like that. I think I would, I think I feel like that everything will still be there while I was riding along. Oh! I have to stop and think about it, but I You know what your natural endorphin would come to the surface and you just start getting the feeling of well-being. Well that's the thing like, it's You come to solutions and conclusions and everything's right with the world. And we'd better go back now. If you twitched a horses lip or ear that happens, I would really like to see if I twitched your ear. And can we get a Well Yeah. Mm. It brings their endorphin to the . Did you see The World According to Garth? No. On Sunday. Well I saw a little bit of it, if I wo I keep wanting to see this film Mm. and I've never actually seen it. If you know what I mean? And erm oh just put them on that table over there. No I don't wanna get back there, I don't wanna go back up to the wards so I'll go that way or that way? That way. That way? Thanks. Yeah. I've forgotten which way I come in. It's easily done. Bye. And erm he's, he's got these papers like with short stories Mm. and the wind blows them away out of his hand, so erm Shit! Oh shit! you're meant to get them in the bin not out of the bin. And th he's picking them all up and this one there's a like a rockwe erm, doberman pinscher standing and these papers between his legs . urgh! Urgh! Like this, and he's saying, Bonkers, now give me that paper! Give me that paper! The dog just leaps on him right,so he's wrestling this dog, and he's screaming and the dog going, growling at him and everything Aha. and then suddenly you hear the dog goes running off and he's bit its ear! So he goes to see his mother who's a nurse at the Aha. school where he lives, cos she's the nurse, like a matron, and er she said Garth! What's this? Was it its ear ? The dog's ear . It's a little triangle of the dog ! Oh no! I mean it was cruel Oh my God! but it was funny cos he just aargh! Like this . Ah ah ah! The dog went off yelping. Bless its little cotton socks. Bet that didn't release its natural endorphin. Ah Ah. We'll have a slow mosey. Mhm. I find, tell you what I find difficult is thinking and learning in that class. Mm. Some of the people aren't conducive to learning. I know. I know. And I try not to get stroppy, I try to be you know, otherwise I'm being a complete crab and not joining in, but Mhm. I've found I have to have a lot of conditions. Everything has to be just so for me to be able to learn. It has to be right. I mean half the time I think I don't remember anything because er er, people are so busy blooming playing around and Mhm. shouting and And I'm too nosey to block things out. and When I was sitting in that corridor there was one of the tutors on the phone, only for a short while and I couldn't even blot him out cos I was too nosey to listen to what he was talking about. I don't think it's deliberate. But I'm No. I'm reading Just curious. I'm aware of it. Naturally curious. I can't revise when I know that Geoff's in. If he is, I go upstairs to be by myself. The telly has to be off. Well you see I have to have the telly very quiet and last night, ah! To I'm sure he's going deaf you know. Mm mm. And I, I keep going down and I'll turn it down, and then I'll go out room and he turns it back up again. It's like living with a cantankerous old man ! It's enough to make you deaf. What? Well the sound quality's not very good. I says, well I can hear it upstairs! He says well you're The trouble is you're just over-sensitive! what you can hear upstairs is going, ooh ooh, ooh ooh! Oh! Ooh ooh! And the music! Yeah. The theme tunes that are on. Oh ! Dear me! I wish it was that. Well I'll go and get two, three. I'll soon get Oh yeah. Yeah. Well that's your fault. I was saying I thought she was lovely! Yeah. Exclusive to Mm mm. Mm mm. Yeah. It's nearly time for Neil. I'm cold now. It's cold in here. The nights are drawing in. Impact and intervention A ball? bodily functions . The Newcastle College of Health Studies Ball . Yeah? Erm, yes. Twenty pound a ticket! That's what it was last time wasn't it? Meal, disco and band. Well, can I tell you the first one we went to we went to get food and there was none left! Well that'll be on the . And there was a lovely spread! But by the time we got there, and there was and there was people there I've never even seen before in my life! I suppose this one's it's cheap. That was, it's always the one beside the Civic Centre one? Yeah. The one you went to when I was ill? It's good like. Yeah. If you can get in. It was me and Clare dancing on the table there. difficult to get in. At least it was just us and we were gonna Well have you seen Helen's video? No. No. Nobody has. Oh! It's brilliant. Have you,can I ask, have you got pink in your hair? Yeah, I've I sprayed it pink for the Rocky Horror and I can't get it out! I was, I keep looking and I'm thinking Is it pink? it's the light. It's the light. It's still a bit pinky. Just a little bit. Was it good? The Rocky Horror? It was brilliant! Eh! It took four shampoos to, to get the bugger out! I thought it was my eyesight. No. No. I love the Rocky Horror Show! Anyway, she's got the erm video right Mm. and there's a bit with Helen and Steve and you know what Helen was like when they was Steve? drunk. Big Steve. And sh Oh! Right. they showed it to, to me. It was her face! And, and Ellen was gonna bring it into college but ca er Helen said don't you dare! So she's, she's Yeah. cut out that bit. That bit. Ellen cut it off. Oh! Oh! Yeah. Cut it? Yeah. So, it was ever so bad apparently ! It was really good. Everyone was on it. Everyone was having a good time. It was really good. Well th maybe I should look at it seeing as I missed it. I can just remember Helen's bum! You were in hospital. That's all I saw all night! Denise. What on? That do at Aye. I just remember her backside wherever I saw always Helen's backside. I think they should have another one. Seeing as I missed it. Yeah. Yeah. And come back with Mark . I spent my whole night following him around! Following him round. And you, and with Steve, Ellen can pick it out. Oh have you? Well you shouldn't have cos we wanted to see I've seen it and, and it was the best the best time I had was . It was good. Right. Am I telling you about this? Yeah. Sorry. Have I made much sense so far? Yeah. Yeah, but I the man Can I the patient looks outside in and carer looks inside out. Inside out. Right. And here's, here's his journey right. G P appointment, outpatient appointment, tests, admission, medical treatment, nursing care,planning and follow-up. And that's the patient from his journey out? That's his journey right? Here, he's looking in how he came, where is it? Route. Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba But is it the round window, the square window, or the arched window? There's one. Da, da, dee dee dee. Right, it says here,quality can only be asse assured ,pa beg your pardon,if both patient's view, he's looking in there. Right. in, and the care-givers view looking out are in agreement . Right. What if they're not? What To a is the one that we're actually doing? Yeah. That's right. To achieve this quality assurance should mean, that when the patient feels his care is not good he should know how he can complain without any worry that he will be penalized, and in the certainty that action will be taken immediately . And that's these things here. There's patient questionnaires, complaints, da da, er ba la visitor inspections, complaints, patient questionnaire, there's a basically all the same kind of thing, or relative survey. Patient questionnaire. So, basically, what they're saying there's all these things that they'll provide at each stage of his journey so that if care isn't right he knows what channels to go through to complain. My criticism of that being is But what if it's not carried out? it's, it's al the quality's not there to start with. How can you He da he won't know what, what quality of care is though. Well er, the patient has his views about what Yeah. he expects, good nursing care But his views aren't really gonna be necessarily good nursing care cos a lot of people wouldn't know No, everybody's individual. And to get, what it says here, to get quality assurance, the patient's views, and the care-giver's views have to be in agreement. What, say you're the care-giver and I'm the Yeah. patient what I think is good nursing care might not be what you think is good nursing care. But what you know is not gonna be the same. It has to be the same for quality assurance. But it's not gonna be the same. But that will Yeah cos you I tell you what I think It says on our research thing say that, say that erm . Say that Er, say yes to that one. I shan't ask anything. But will it tell me the truth? Well, see, for one is she's not erm as bad as that. You know, some patients I could think of seem to have the idea that everything should be done for them in hospital Mm. and that to them is good care if a nurse does everything for them, but it's not. If, you're taking all Yeah. Mm. And when he goes into Plus they also say that a nurse is always busy and they're angels, and they're, that and the other, that they won't complain. Well that's the only way that this can be assessed, is by, so that the patient blah blah la when a patient feels his care is not good he knows he can complain without any worry . But complaining, I mean, if he's gotta complain it means that quality assurance isn't there. But This is only thing if they've got something to complain about. if you were the patient nurse So there's nothing to actually say In a positive sense? Yeah. Yeah. The only thing that So if it says Yeah. erm meaning ha blah blah and action taken . It should also mean that when Mr , that's it, says the nurses were marvellous, the nurses are able to say in all evidence, and with evidence to support their opinion, yes We were crap! we are really doing a pretty good job. That's all it says in a positi from a positive angle. Yeah but A pretty good job. So what do you think ? But like, if you take like like er,le let me, if you were the patient and Lesley was the nurse like, you wouldn't have a clue whether it was er Exactly. good or not, because as long as it was pretty clean. Let's have a look what examples they're using. Well that's what I was trying to say, because all the patient doesn't know what to expect anyway. I mean, the patient wouldn't know whether it was like clean Well these are the criteria leaves for tests and investigations for tests and investigations, for example good facilities, up-to-date working equipment, nice staff, competent qualified staff Well I'm not nice. written and verbal information, appropriate tests, no complications . But not necessarily the procedure itself. If you, if you were the patient you might say it's wrong because erm she doesn't look like she knows what she's doing or there's a mistake or something gets missed. Yeah. You know. But I mean, on that, well I think it's Well I think the whole point of it is erm, the patient's not gonna know that I'm, first of all, not gonna know anything about nurses, Yeah. Because he didn't, he stayed cos they class him as an A person. And he might take a personal dislike to one of nurses. Yeah. They can only evaluate the care that they've had can't they? At the end of their stay. Whether they, they feel, they feel better and whether that's because the nurses have done a good job or not. So ideally, er Nurses can, they can only they can only say evaluate a certain proportion of the erm Yeah. things in question. Well it says for the nurses to is to be able to evaluate. Waiting list monitoring, outpatient department review, observation, visits erm nursing audit, medical audit, care review, qualifications check . Well you see the bit about the waiting You know it's all very list right? Mm. That's one thing here, will get them in and out, but I've spoken to patients who say they don't get the care here and, on the surface it looks a brilliant hospital, it gets them in and out, you know, it does everything, it's got all the facilities but it doesn't give them the care. Mm. I think the biggest bogey is, is where That's right. it says,quality can only be assured if both patient's view and care-giver's view are in agreement cos that's gonna be really hard to achieve isn't it? Yeah. Where's it say that? Make sure I've written it down. Yes, but quality doesn't just co erm, take into account the care that's given, it takes into erm, what equipment you've got on, whether th er, the equipment's used properly. I mean, but that that is what I was pointing out and we have some, say you have somebody qualified to go and visit each patient What the hell's a ? even just to like I feel we're doing the research do you know what I mean? Mhm. Mm. Yeah. I will say that. What about yours Neil? Come on Neily. Hang on, I've lost my, my work. back too soon. That's wishful thinking. Wears my out. I've got my husband's on. What? Socks . Not the same ones as yesterday? No, I've got about five, no I've got about four pairs the same. Two pairs of blue and two pairs of red. You mean your husband's got four pairs? Well Mm. Right. My art Thirteen centre. My Sorry. my article's about raising the standards of health care in the hospitals. It's all the same really. And it, it looks upon nurses feel about their own standard of care and, the article then goes on about Standard they provide? standard they provide for Mm. the patients. And then the it goes on about setting up the single but dynamic standards a setting system it's called, divided into local level groups like a tier system, you get the Managing Director on the top and the ones at the bottom. And they're called quality assurance, or standard setting teams made up of volunteers from the local wards. The main base made up of volunteers from the local wards like nurses and well I mean nurses and auxiliaries like that. But it's bring, it says things about care and assessing that quality care's being met on their ward and the hospital itself and about once every six months to meet up with other hos members of other hospitals in the area and discuss different aspects of raising the standards of care. And the introduction about about care is passed up the three tiers, like a triangular system's Mm. passed up a three tier system. And if the ideas are good then er incorporated into the care, they're incorporated into the hospital's manifesto if you want, if you like. But there's one one fault really it takes approximately fifteen to eighteen months for them to pass anything like that and that could be one Downfall. downfall, one criticism about Yeah, cos this one says it's immediate. Yeah. Well this one takes fifteen to eighteen months and that's to me that's just ridiculous really. And then, it would take another however to implement any changes that they decided upon. Basically they, they just provide the ideas which get passed They provide the er to the top of the ladder That's it. and then And they're the ones in the situation so they get pa they're the ones who are actually on the ward at the bottom and then pass it up. It's like Yeah. being in parliament really, you have to pass everything up. Well the thing is though people at the top don't necessarily see the problems that you see as problems No they don't, no. as being problems do they? That's probably why it takes fifteen to eighteen months to get a a result. To get there. It's not gonna help the patient like, at the time, like, at the time if your patient complains, something will be done. What happens there and then? If your patient complained, like, I dunno Probably be dead by the time Gone out the window! Yeah! What if you've got a loved one? And, and we sort of no yours doesn't necessarily apply to some people to say, they might just think, oh it'll be I know. good idea to Just what you think. Yes, by the time it comes to getting round to your complaint you've moved on. Mm mm. It's unbelievable how many they . So is that it basically? If you want to call an issue but I was on about setting up these committees to assess the standard of care. I've got a bit like that, and says the erm quality assurance systems will have to be different in each health district, with like being variations. But it says, it has identified key elements, and one of those elements is a Director of Quality Assurance should Yeah. be appointed with responsibility for setting up the district-wide programme. She would receive minutes of all meetings and have the right to attend these meetings to provide a quality assurance input. So that's the same And like I must have got the er the review board should be er six six requirements for these groups. Mm mm. They must voluntary to the whole . Right. Erm, there must be more than six people. There must be a meeting once every three or four weeks for one and a half hours. And the meeting should be held in a place where it is possible to work in our situation. And a leader should be appointed. Yeah. Yeah, but even with all those things in their favour it still takes fifteen months? It still takes fifteen to eighteen months to deliver to pass But the leaders are nearly always someone like a Director of Nursing or somebody like that, who has no ward experience But you need somebody higher up on a day to day to be able to pass these bills doesn't it? To be able to pass the , yeah, try to get them to pass it. Right. It cannot be get background. Mhm. Mm. So, the major criticism for that is higher Is up Fifteen up. high. to eighteen months. Lyndsey. Fifteen months minimum. I think I had it once before. What? I just you know, I'm not sure. I know. I think so. Well, when you've got five minutes come and knock 's door . Well as long as you know about yours and then when she does direct the question at you about that particular Shall I tell you what mine's about? Well I've told you what mine's about. Shut up! You're gonna get this too. Mm mm. It's about a two different tools. A tool being? My body is my tool! Whatever you like. One's called the monitor and one's called called the system . There you are. That's all we need to know is it? Right. Well you could even call it a system. Somewhere. Can we go home now? We may as well get cracking with research mightn't we? Well, we're waiting for these lot. Ah! Can we start when the others come back? Sure can. Can we start now? Why have we covered before the others come back ? Then we'll get out five minutes early and we'll see a bit more of Eastenders. I can't afford to wait. I'm gonna have to vote at seven o'clock on Thursday morning. I'm gonna have to vote as well, I dunno who the hell I'm voting for. Me too. I don't. You're gonna contact everyone Why? else. Because Ah! In the erm I haven't, I haven't gotta vote any more In the Nursing Times it tells you the N H S manifestos for each party. Does it? Mhm. Where? Last week. Oh! Mhm. The thing is, I mean we're hardly to getting to grips with other people . But the thing is, there's been that many changes now, so having a bloody Labour government is just gonna be back to square one and into reverse you know, and go back. Oh God! I wan I don't want him as Prime Minister. Oh! Not . You know, I am fed up! Last night Channel one Yeah. election channel two some bloody crap! Channel three, election channel four, election. And that's just on telly. I said turn that Yeah,. rubbish off! I mean you had John Major on one side, Paddy Ashdown on the other, Neil Kinnock on the other. Paddy Ashdown's the only one worth listening to. I mean Neil, Neil Kinnock for God's sake! he's a wanker! I know. Let's not talk about . It's election constantly on the telly. Six o'clock News is extended. Mm. They have they have extended from six o'clock till quarter to seven and then Have you noticed that when there's a general election you have about five minutes of news there's never any di and disasters like thirty five minutes of bloody election coverage! Probably is, but it's not Vote Bean! Why don't they have a big old disaster and see if they feature it on the news Well they wouldn't. It would have two minutes at the end! It makes you wonder what news Well there is to tell you! a runaway train has run straight through And we're gonna need your head. Yeah. Well last night er And there's been an earthquake and everything there's the everybody's dead. Vote Paddy Ashdown. there's been eight miners trapped down in Yorkshire but the election Cos you know what he does? He always says, and we're the party that doesn't quarrel! Bloody hell! What hell what an excuse is that ? And they always say the same things and you think, oh you told us that yesterday. No I'm not voting for him, he's had an affair. That's the only thing he's got going for him. Who's voting for Tory here? I might. Me, no. Anyone else? I'm sorry. I think I will. I think I will and all. Lesley goes by the majority. No! I wo no! No! I'm not going by No ! the No! majority. I mean, could you live with Neil Kinnock Prime Minister? He's a No. pillock! Anyway, John Major's the You mean you could? only English one. Tell you what, I prefer Maggie Thatcher back. Where's er where's Yeah. Paddy Ashdown from like? He's er Irish. From Galway I think he is. He's a Paddy. He is Irish. Ooh! Well I didn't ne it could be Patrick. Well, that's Irish. If Patrick's Irish, it's called Paddy doesn't it? Not necessarily. Well it doesn't! Not much. Tony's dad's called Patrick and he's not Irish. I never said he was, I just said that he's called Paddy. I don't agree. Like a . Called Paddy O' really. It doesn't mean he's not Irish. Paddy O' . Oh! Now Alison I reckon we should all vote for Mr Bean! I would rather vote for Bruce myself. Mr Bean! The greedy party. Who you voting for? Jane, you don't have to go to Ireland to vote do you? Oh right Her laugh! Ah! Com come on there. Everybody's that bad. No I mean, that was so funny how he taking this . I think he's funny, that's why Well I don't think it's as funny really. I mean, I think a lot of people wouldn't do that . Yeah . Are you gonna move back a bit missus? Why? Please. I'll not be able to see the board. I think I'd rather, rather vote for Bruce . Who's he? He sings, I wanna be elected. I don't give a damn really! Is unity possible? Well is it? Bloody hell! What's that for? Ah yes, but I did it like, like that though. Are you revising for that? We did that yesterday? I can't remember writing that. You did. Yeah. I remember writing that. No. Yeah. That's what I said. More pain and more And it began with A? Yes. Did the research and that. Do all You made it up? I think this model's er That's amazing! erm I'm impressed! I know. I'll, I think it'll be on the Well that's all we did. and everything man. See what we'll be doing. So Er so was I, even though I failed them. I have got a bit about it. Communication is one of those things that I'm not I'm not very confident about this one. Oh! I'm not. Well I'm going to work at Guild Hall. I was gonna Oh! Lucky you! I wish I was going to work. I'll have no excuse. I all these stubs and things! It's like, tell us what's in the software. Er Come on Bedge! So you're tell him off! Good job we ran this innit? Yeah, if it'll . Now what was the file you called when you ran sa when you ran stat I called it stat I'm sure I did. No. Put it in the box. In there. Hang on. Kick the mother fucker! No, woh! No, hang on! Hang on a sec ! I just wanna see if it's been erased since we've been digging around. Probably has you see. Right, okay. Point select. Forwards er No airline! Why don't you run with airlines on all the time? Well I've got confused! Well if i if it comes up and tells me there's no airlines there, then I can assume that there's no airlines! That's right! It didn't! It said there was zero air , that means th there's none there. What do you mean none there? Well there's one there now cos we just connected it. If you a, right I reckon what's happened, you've done a delete on a signal at some point right? And it hasn't been pulled up on the airline? No, you've when you do a delete erm if you do con ex signal, if you have that on signal it deletes the whole signal, airlines and all. I always have it on sig as much as poss . It defaults the sig That's, that's usually what happens. Anyway that doesn't solve the problem now anyway! Oh my God! So we gotta do the bloody thing again anyway! Yeah. Do you want me to put this one in or do you want the other one to go in? I wasn't told! ! Well I I mean I was, I was relying on the, on the . It's, erm, didn't you do these things like erm join the numbers up when you were a kiddy Yeah. You know, in these little books? It's just like that. That says that said to me zero airline so I thought ah great, it's all connected! You know? Well the con activity test told you it wasn't! Well I hadn't got through that had I? I would have discovered once I'd been through it all. Good Lord! Ooh no! Ooh no! That one's get it like that red well that number's moved. Yeah. It goes blue, green, blue, green, blue That's a bit of alive. Hang on! Blue, blue, green Boo ber ber ber ber ber . Right, that's green. Blue. We bring that one red down there. Doo doo . Move these around. We can go no we can't cos of that. This'll be a good one! Do you want to do it? Yeah, I can do it. ? Ow I mean we might as well pitch it now. Pitch those plots. Hang on a sec ! Wha what's happening here? That can come right down here and then blue underneath. Pull that one down. Well I just wondered why it goes there, in It could go down one couldn't it? It goes hold that. Well it's as broad as it's long really. Mm. That just says a bit. Mm, no. It just means changing it. This is the same thing though? Yeah. A bit devious isn't he? One things gone down there. Well Mark did it didn't he! Well the problem is, is that you don't like teeing off do you? Don't like teeing off signals. It's gotta be Yeah, you could of done come off at a pin. So Yeah but you could of come across Well I couldn't from there I remember working on that one and I did it because all this lot was a ,. I just pulled it up from that bottom. Probably this again. Oh but you see It's alright, look I mean that one Hang on! Yeah, but I mean that one you could of shifted this lot put some kinks in this one a bit, right? Moved all that lot up. Yeah but I don't like putting kinks in! You could of gone round with the kinks It's horrible! The kinks Well yeah but it's better tha , I mean that's that's like a bus signal and that's like a ser ,this one that's going round. Is that now? That straight? What you doing? That straight? What's straight? That light. Which one? That one. That one isn't. I know that one isn't! That it's an zoom delete it. This is difficult really. They're gone now. Look! Look at that! Alright! Don't fuck about! Oh no Mrs! Oh No! Gotta go! No. It's gotta go! No. You don't think ahead that's the trouble! I do! You're a cunt Bedge! Patronising bastard! You gotta think head! I think head everyday! You've left a C print on there. Hang on! You've left a It's alright! C pri I'm getting the poxy bloody grid! I why do I have to work with that grid? Cos you can see what you're doing then. Oh! No, it's all naughty and I find the horrible! if you have the grid on you don't miss airlines. I believe you! There's a segment there left! You just make sure What the hell did that jump across there for? There's a fucking segment on there! I told you there's a bloody segment, and does he listen? No! He well he never listens He just goes and clicks the bloody buttons! he never listens to you anyway Bedge ! Look! If the Ah it's still a bloody segment innit? my God! That's awful isn't it? Ah! And look at that! Look at these D L C's you put in there look! That's gone, right! Let's just do board delete that'll probably help won't it? Okay, so I'm coming from here You delete up to there! What's that? Oh it's the big airlines. Yeah, yeah, that's the one yeah, right. Ah like a bloody I'll leave you at it! I'm glad to hear it! God! Run you over! I'll get it sorted and I will do it again! Cor, I dunno ! Look Dave, look! Clever boy! Charge up my batteries cos of my aeroplanes. Oh you're into Got my charger. aeroplanes are you? I'm into model aeroplanes, yes. Oh dear! Well , not recently but I'm hoping to get back to it. When I er when I get the time. Yes, yes. I'll have to From the Hollies take . the Hollies Yeah. Well the trouble is they're so small now aren't they? Yeah. Because they restricted the area so much if you got a big plane that like, to by pass now. It's all gone again now. There was one Don't have a lot of time to think,You know ! there was one bloke over in erm tha you know, with a man la , that I used to work with and he, he used to fly from Hollies , and he lost his plane one day and fle , flew out of range and er he he spent weeks looking for it! Couldn't find! Because th the the sort of corn and barley would, was er was almost ready for Bloody! er harvesting, and he was frightened that he was getting a bit panicky cos if, you know, frightened a combine had had run over it. So But he went and hired and plane from Richmond Airport Oh God! Must of And th cost him a fortune! this guy flew him round and he saw it! He spotted it from there and he wen , went and got it. Probably cost him twice the amount! To hire a plane than the thing's worth! Well yeah! I have heard cases of erm planes being lost in in er crops chu chur churned up! Mm. Farmers aren't happy ! No I know. But there's a couple of guys in another division over there that they were quite keen on er aircraft and they spent weeks building these bloody things and then er, and experienced flyer he'd taken over to the other, other side of the estate when he had a bit of runway over there Aha. and fly them, and they usually flew for about ten seconds and he smashed it! And they came back for another fortnight of re-building ! He said I saw too much! Where's that bloody kettle? Two weeks after he'd said Haven't we ten second flight! Hasn't Yunny put the kettle on yet? He's just gone. He's just gone What a to get it. what a lazy bastard! I'll bloody steal his notes Yeah, when I first I used to fly, actually screen flying. Mm. Tremendous you know! I had this plane a a low four nine engine and I was only a kid. I bought it in village in Mark's Wood I used to take it up the runway and Yeah. took off and I was circle ground, it was quite a windy day then this stood there with me , had no control over the thing, like! And it er I think I think the engine cut at about Well Norm is stepping outside. Is he? Oh! Is he? Yeah. Ooh, my God ! I'm a man myself, ha? But er, is he though? Erm yeah er e , I couldn't hit, you know, just went outside and er what was this? Er, I went out the next day to go to er th yeah that was a Sunday I lost it. And before I went to school on the Monday, drove back down the marsh and went in this forest trying to find it. And we went round this estate can't remember where it was and erm thought knock on the doors and se , ask people had seen it and then later in the day this woman phoned up and said she saw a couple of kids walk down the road with it and sort of ca , called them over and said oh I heard that his, his . So I got it back. That was lucky! And it wasn't broken! I was Yeah? absolutely flabbergasted! That was a bit lucky! Could of been a gonner there! Could of been indeed. Drink? Well drop one, they're still looking. They're still looking. No, I I got plenty of time, I'm not in a hurry. Cos I I got plenty of time. Still looking. Is there still the news about carrying here? Oh I could do. I I I I think that's one of the options that I could sort of er I could still be the li , cleaner over here. If I ain't got a job by June I could still be here cleaning. You gotta take a pay cut then? Oh yeah well er well wo I'd take a pay cut because erm well I'd have to take a pay cut anyway, but the thing is though, with my pension with my pension from day one I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway. If I can take home a hundred and twenty quid well with my seventy pound a week pension two hundred quid. So I ain't gonna be too bad off anyway. I mean, sort of er you know Well, it sounds alright. Probably make a bit more hours, and course there might be er a a couple of hours a night, it'll probably be I reckon it'll probably from five to about er seven. The proper hours. And thing I suppose. Well the thing is, I don't think they're gonna put stran , they're not gonna put a stranger over here. Who don't know the job. Well, it's a bit risky for security as well isn't it? Well yeah! They're not gonna put, they're not gonna put a stranger over here are they? Really? I mean they're gonna you know? I mean, if I sort of just stay for a, for a while but er I've still keep looking for work looking for a job cos I do wanna get away from B T. The sooner I get away the better! But I'm not in a hurry at the moment. So I can't go anywhere anyway. I wanna erm hopefully er hopefully I can get myself a car once I get the money. Buy one. Weren't gonna splash it all out you know? All at once? No I wouldn't splash it all out but I'd get quite a bit cos of the twenty years. I've still got my, er get a car for about a couple of grand. Get a second hand car for a couple of grand and er I'll still have a little bit. We might pay some of the mortgage off and er er, if there's any you know, we sort of keep some in there. Keep some in the Yeah. building society. At least, at least if I had another job you see and er well I'm taking home two hundred odd two hundred pound a week. Well I worked out a hundred and twenty here and seventy pound pension. I wouldn't need to touch that money. That'd still be erm that'd still be in the er still be in the building society could be making me money. Yeah. I mean er You get some er the old interest There's the can't you? Well especially if you put it in your high interest. Yeah. Which once I've wo , which I will. The trouble is with high interest account you can't get the money out very quickly can you? Ah? You can't get the money out very quickly. Just give them plenty of notice like er a month's notice to get the money out. Oh well, yeah. That er So if you need it in a hurry it can be a problem. Yeah. Well we could have it in a ordinary account it's sa , still sort of er . You know? Just report or not. I might be able to some in er, in the ordinary account and some in the high interest account. Yeah. You could do that can't you? Oh yeah, split it up as you like! Oh! Oh yeah, but er but I'm not in a hurry anyway. I've got plenty of time. John! Right. Your tea cup got . How dare you ! Phone! Okay, boy Oy, slaphead! Me? Yeah, the chap from Arkworth Generation for you. Excellent! I'm not sure this machine the actual driver board can I know. Yeah. Because I've been trying to swop between that one and that one. In that we see the one coloured drive right? Yeah. We can re resist the and run from to that copy. When Bedge got it in I say look le I I wanna swop it see what happen. And I took, he swop it he he wouldn't three sixty two. No. I'm not sure, is it the driver that's the problem or not? So you may have to ask Norman if it'll now work. I think we will blame the or th all got in, got in. We will have some money left behind not a lot. Cos the machines in my old office all of them, all the five and a quarters agree both types. And the three and a halfs agreed with seven twenties. Yeah. Yeah! I mean this one can I mean what is what's the point in a, in a drive that'll rig one point two but not three sixty? Useless! And erm the one I got, in there can rig well three sixty K and one point two meg, no problem! As soon as I charge straight into here, what happen with it? I think it's something to with the, with the actual er driver board. Yeah. And you get all set one wha erm setting. You gonna have, you can't have a few. So we may have a, quite another a board or what? I don't know. They will let you know. They'll have to! If I could get my . Then I could have that machine and Justy can have mine. One. What I'm trying to say is that yo ,i now you gotta order another to , forty six. How do I know what's having ? Who's getting the other one then? I dunno. Mm. I have a lot of feeling right? That's it's . When these boys has come along and Colin would he look at John and what do boys say? Well he can't have yours cos he's not doing compiling that No. needs fast processing time. Tony is the one who will definitely jump up and fucking , but I tell him to fuck off! But Colin I mean Frank said to you you can have Yeah. cos you need it for your work! Yeah, but Frank did tell me to keep it, keep quiet! Don't make any don't make war! I don't know it, so I keep quiet. Don't make Yeah but as soon as he walks in here he'll go, ah new machine! Yeah. How's that then? Well you'll have to convince that it's, it's just a three eight six. Cor God! That amazes me why people, it's like a status symbol they have to have the best bloody machine! Well there's no point! But, I have Bedgey look to be honest right he do more compiling than me. If he want the forty six , I mean the forty six I give you this. And he, and he say ah no, but it's alright I got my . But, he said if if Franky order another one he say, I shall have a forty six. Be , originally they order two forty sixes one for Colin and one for Andy. Mm. But when the money tight and they, they can't get the bloody thing! Yeah, well you haven't got it yet anyway have you so Well, I will, I will get it and all the will come in here and we'll hide it or whereby no no, no one will fucking see it! And go, I set it up all working and there's fuck oh ho! It is isn't it? Oh what a pity! Can you stick in that box? But the thing is, they look so different. Don't they? And like Ian's four eight sixes, it's so different to one of those it's not like you can get away with it. Completely different, re-designed box and everything. You still using that monitor? No. Wo , have a look at this monitor? Ay? Come here, it's your monitor, everything. So I can have that monitor with that machine, ha? Yeah, you, you can get everything. Oh right. But we asked erm Colin,di did he want a monitor? And he say no! Mm. Th , the super V G A is better than the, just the V G A. They can give you twe , two hundred two hundred and er, fifty six colour. So Is this V G A or E G A? That's a Philips, a V G A. Is it? It's a normal, it's like your one, it's normal V G A. Oh! Sixteen colour. If you open tha ,ma my window, the picture is compared with the wha you put in there . Oh yeah. So I don't know what is going on! So I'm not over exciting . A Bloody politics place ! Well you got a valid reason for having a fast machine. Right! I better get the out then. And my bloody ! Ow! Well, and I put an order in to buying erm two more of these five and a quarter inch. It'll rebo Mm? That will,wi tha tha will rebo soft. Yeah, but I think th , probably the thing with number Then the driver innit? Well if it can't, it can't. Yeah well there's a problem with that because they might be on different project number mighten they? Yeah but doesn't matter! In this group, doesn't matter. In other group, maybe. Mm. In this group ,. So if you want a se see er er a normal reception you want some some level if you want what? One. If you wanna thick one want a monitor this way,, but not a lot. So you don't wanna put all that in. But it does or some order. But whereas anyone order from this company say well what do you want? Do you want a big one or a small one? If you want a huge order oh you can look for your own. When Len sent them a five pound order, or ten pound Mm. you can leave that . Th there is a if there is work in our group, no problem! As soon as we've been , all been We'll have to write that one with a indelible pen. Yes. You only get on go at it as well. So that is I dunno, you get it off with spirit I suppose. Maybe, I think you can get erm erm in, what they done on Norman's they're using a tape. A tape? Oh that's messy! Er well if you're gonna draw the line I mean I mean it's bloody we know what who's in, who's out. Yeah. Yeah, have a chat with Norman. Okay. The only problem is, I dunno if there's a mistake on this but this modem box right? Is one six one and this is it's ha! You're hoping! Yeah. It's not going into anything is it? No, it isn't, it's not got a socket or anything right? It'll have Norm! Yeah. it'll have four How do you change Look likes the actual box is one six one, this is one sixty right? Yeah. Cos I put erm So that's gonna be a bit small, but a dimension in there. we're not gonna have these connectors on so we all can do whatever size we want really can't we? Yeah. Talk to me! Cli ,wha what's the depth? The depth is erm six four one. four one. So how big's that? That will take us is it clear up Oh right! to there, to here. Erm Yeah, okay. Well what we can do No, what we'll do first ride is put in a connector, you know those connectors? Yeah. That these fellers are on? Yeah. You can get them with long pins each si have them standing up the board and then you have another board, a board with a so you can That's what I was saying! cut the pillars those there. Perhaps, yeah we might find that by the time we got to might not be able to get it all on. Cos that is like a sixth of the area isn't it? What we'll do alright? Mhm. I reckon . If we erm I'll get a if I got time today. Alright? Yeah, so basically Then, yeah, we'll just try and get through today. Start , see what the actually gonna do. Yeah, like , yeah? I mean all the chips will fit, but you gotta . Am I that boring Frank? I didn't Yeah ! say anything you know! No, not half! I didn't. But I di , I didn't realise that I thought you were actually. How old did you think I am? What an insult! Erm He's not that old are you? No, no . I suppose about be erm fifty nine. No, no no no, I'm . Erm, so you had to have didn't you? Erm, I , yes. Yeah,yo , we well we won't do that . Erm, I probably do all that but I don't . How are you? Fine, thank you. I've got a Find your headache, but Surviving? I feel a lot better. Oh well. I went for a walk out this morning but I just couldn't stand it. No. it's no good I'm gonna have to go out for a breath of fresh air. I'm better going do you? But I've got to be honest with you you know. No So he says I'm going out I said oh I feel I'm going out for half an hour that's all. Yeah I can't see the pleasure you know. So you seem a lot better Got a lot of washing to do lie down Yeah he'd like that. Yeah, he'd like that. I know but I thought So I've bit busy with other things anyway. I thought what I'd do was I'd have a bath, I thought I'd put all the back in the fridge Yeah. and I've gotta put that erm on tonight as well. Yeah. So that might be as well. Yeah. See I don't feel as I did last night but it's still there, you know I just take some more tablets like, you know. Yeah. But er Nearly getting rid of it but I've really cracked it and it's bloody awful! It does No oh aye, it does. Really cold, really, it's horrible! We didn't do him any good at all. Telling me he got six points for a driving convic for er speeding conviction Halfords I should think Oh right! When he got erm Oh Smell it. See if it smells alright Got any Oh We have to that's why Aye Mm Too much I got your er table things. They do them in packs of fifty but in Oh a split pack I got sixty. That should be enough, shouldn't it? Oh Or did I get seventy? I think I got seventy just to be sure. I thought sixty Oh alright. That's alright. was enough so I got seventy Oh right. cos there's only fifty Yeah. So I got seventy. As I said, they do, they must do them themselves and sell Oh right. They've got a well in that shop. Oh have they? Yeah. It's all bricked up. What else you've been doing? Oh I've done a bit of drawing. you wanna get your hair cut while you're there Yeah. Yeah, I ought to go and get changed Yeah, well don't stand about Yeah, that's alight. I'll get Oh yes. changed. I'll just leave them ticking over then? Yeah. I won't be long. Yeah, okay. Just go and get myself changed. Yeah, I mean you see works' vans all over the place regular. Yeah. Naughty boys! I never thought about that. ha oh. Not if they keep his licence. No. Speeding. Dangerous driving. Dangerous driving cos he made the old woman give over and overtook somewhere totally stupid and probably find he had no brake. He was slowing down anyway! What are we gonna do? It's spitting and spotting innit? Yeah. Fancy having another cup of tea? Yeah. That's if you look at it, like, you only get two chances at speeding now. Mm. Which is harder than it used to be.

Cost him about six or seven hundred quid a year. Cheaper to buy a blimming er cheaper to insure a car wouldn't it? Mm. Oh no matter what he gets, it's always over five hundred quid cos he's he's Yeah. lost his licence in the past and you know, when he was a kid like Mm. and all that Takes a long while before they forget about that, doesn't it? Yeah. Making himself an extra five hundred pound a year for er having been a naughty boy when he was a teenager. Mm. That's what it's about now, innit? Yeah. It's all the He is actually quite sane now though. Yeah, well it's like this fellow that got done for speeding. When did he get done? Er Thur no Wednesday. sat there watching them catch him up he didn't see them before they got him stopped like. Saw them catch him up coming along with all their blue lights thinking . They'd been in er garage at bottom. Mm. Aye. We'd had a little car before he got there. He said are you speaking to the no, no,around town he says, I don't mind doing a bit more, you know, out and about not much about they just sat in the traffic, you know. Mm but erm so had it been a Foxhalls, something about a minute no, he said only for about a mile, that was it. I said oh, about forty seconds and he sort of looked. I says well, at sixty you do a mile in a minute. So I said if it's only for a mile it's going to be well less than a minute at eighty, presuming you were doing more than thereabouts and er that was it. But the car, he'd er he says oh that was funny he says, I blew past him, popped into fourth, I blew past him real easy going up the . Come out at Foxhalls at forty, I think he did. He can come through Foxhall like and he, he'd had to speed up he says and then he says he didn't carry on, like. He hadn't been doing and er reckon he and er think I'm and that was it so right Been driving since he was nineteen two or three months ago, I think it was. I remember him saying once before I don't, I don't know what and er he says it's only a fortnight ago since you know . You get done for, pulled up for speeding or parking or something and you can pay your own fine . So I went home, anybody gonna pay me fine? He says I am gonna cop it off me mother cop it of his mother. You're always going too fast! I told you before! He says me dad al me dad was always speeding he, he used to go mad! Mm. slow down. Yeah obviously watching wasn't, wasn't watching his mirror very hard. He hadn't seen copper trying to get him caught up, I wonder how much he was using mirror when he was overtaking people? Mm, yeah. Whether he was just watching what was coming from the front. Mm saw him coming have to get it cos Neil's mum was cross about it. Oh well he was only just finding out what the rules were. There was a gang of us chatting with him. I come up with six points. That made his day. He says have I got a fixed penalty? I says only got a pink form if you've got a fixed penalty. Know somebody who got one, like. No, only a bloke I've never seen one had one. Yeah, that'd be Richard. Mm only he's got to take his licence and insurance in. As to what happens now he says I've to go to Magistrate's Court so it's just beginning to sink in that it's gonna cost him some brass and it's going to be serious. One of them there was of the opinion who could quite easily lose his licence for it. Like he got done What he do? Run a Chief Constable over? No! No, he got done for speeding. He was over the, over the limit and had a small quantity of drugs with it. Don't think he'd actually taken them but he had as a Mm. possession. They did him about eight hundred pounds in motoring offences Aye. Phew! Speeding while slightly over the limit it was. Him having speed having, having speed . Oh god! Mm Where's today? Dunno. He started to come over, didn't he? Yeah. they don't come any worse get a cup of tea in between, weren't we? Mm. I don't think it would've bothered us when it was spitting and spotting if we'd actually been out there, would it, it's just setting off in it. Aye, yeah. Blue sky!

You know I had a moving traffic accident Yeah wasn't trucking there, you know or owt like that. No sense of humour. Got brought a pushbike wheel the other day. Can you get the cogs off that? Why? Well they go a lot better on that bike of mine. I don't think so. Oh pity. So what you've done to bend the wheel? I haven't. The gaffer knocked somebody off their pushbike, had to buy him a new wheel and some compensation Scrounge the wheel! How do you get them off? He says you go to a pushbike shop and get special tools. Ring spanner things with the Mm. keys on the outside pumps and things on it to I wouldn't bother. A new set of back cogs for bike's only about seven quid. A brand new set and they come with the ra with the, erm free wheel and everything all in like, just screw them on. Go to a pushbike shop they whip them off and whip them on for you you buy, you know, if you go out and buy one then just take wheel with you they'll stick them straight on. Mm that fellow don't go to the police. Lucky to get away with having to buy him a wheel compensation Unusual innit. It's very expensive that's why it's unusual. Sixty nine ninety nine. is that all right? It is done isn't It? why have you got that on your head. What's it doing take it off. Oh yeah. take it off Mm. take it off I don't like it, take it off What? What's wrong with you? What? What? He's bloody mad, he's potty, off his rocker. Where did you get it? Get what? The thing. Well why Well why do you need it, why do you need a towel? Why do you need a towel. Why er why game. Mum and Dad's got it. Come on Mum. Go get in the blooming bath. Why? I'll rewi rewind that actually heard what you say, you must be very naughty and nasty thing to be to your son. I can't have a sweet then. Well you're not give me a sweet an all. Should give me a sweet you know. You should. You're gonna turn it off because I wanna tear you off a strip about something. Me? Yeah. Why? What are we talking about? Mum what's Hamlet about? Pardon? What's Hamlet about? Hamlet? Yes. I don't know much about Shakespeare, the only play I've seen is Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream. to er see Rome and Juliet. Mm. And I think I need to make it up. When is I dunno. Well you better find out then. What do ya mean I alw I'm only saying it cos I got Well no if you can go. You give me the money for it? If it's within reason as I assume it will be. Five Pounds. That's okay. W would it make much difference for you lending me the money. Not a lot. Well there's a quite a bit of difference between five and fifty isn't there and the one thing is for your educational needs and the other I'm so convinced about. Well Yeah. I thought a computer No, but I know that you're dying to have a computer, and if money was no object, then we probably wouldn't hesitate in lending it to you, but really and truly at this moment things are tight and we can't afford to commit ourselves with things unless it's absolutely necessary. Well And that's it, I mean I've made it as plain as I can. That is it and I hate it when you keep on and on nagging. I won't go and see Romeo and Juliet. Well don't go, it's not my fault if you don't pass your exams. All right. Did you watch that animated version that you recorded. Yeah. Does it give you the gist of the story? It,half an hour long. Well I think it's longer than half an hour. They probably should an hour at the most. Given you er erm The film is about hour and five minutes. You can probably have a video of it as long of another version. Well it's does help to see different versions because you see that different people interpret the Why do you Mm? Well it depends on the people who are producing or directing or whatever, so it's all got different ways of doing it. When I was studying I went to Open Air Theatre and I saw a version there on Christopher er what's his name that chubby fellow with the glasses Christopher Biggins that's it. He was playing Puck and when I went to see the Company doing it well they had a completely different way of doing it, they wo they did it really like er a dec you know the the mechanical play, I don't know if you know A Midsummer Night's Dream. They did it in a completely slapstick farce way you know th the men who were dressed up women they balloons and had rosy red cheeks and wigs and things, it was quite different. How they Well that's it, when Shakespeare wrote a play and the text has survived and , but the way of of joshing the people on the way they do it is different every generation and even most of the people in the same generation would would have a different way of doing it. Okay. There's a comedienne erm she apparently was born in Wales. Mhm. Two Ton Tessie O'Shea that's her. Two Ton Tessie? She yeah, that's her her nickname, cos she was quite big and she played the nurse in Romeo and Juliet in the season on Stratford on Avon and she did it using a Welsh accent because she thought Shakespeare, having coming from quite near the Welsh Border Country might well have had might well have had a Welsh nurse. So it didn't matter that Romeo and Juliet is set in Italy. Mm. She did it as she would have thought Shakespeare would have known people and things, you know, she did it like that. Mm. And I remember Amanda seeing a video of Romeo and Juliet And what struck me was that the costumes were all sort of like you see portraits of Elizabethan dress. Now I don't what Italy and those Middle Ages would have been like, that the sort of clothes that were worn. Mhm. But the clothing in that film struck me very much as being like Elizabethan dress. Yeah, I mean now plays of Shakespeare and they're wearing modern dress like those worn at Richard the Third or something and they're wearing well either First or Second World War uniforms. Yes. It was very different then. Yeah, well it's just different directors have different things they want to emphasise in a play and if they want to bring something home or they think that using a certain well like say the way the people are dressed and everything will will have more of an impact, you know will One thing I was wondering about you know they they talk about erm in Shakespeare's works is the language the words he uses, the the sort of poetry of it and the symbolism that's used. Erm do they talk about that at all in your English Literature Yes. Do they show you how you can learn about this, there's a book you know the book I bought you it's got notes in it. Does that help with it? I suppose Pardon? Well you should do. And what about I bought some revision books and things study aids or something for Amanda for her English literature Well I bought them for Amanda and she was doing Romeo and Juliet. So if you look in those you may find there's some help there. Yeah. Is there any more last minute entry for the quiz? Okay, sit, sit still, be quiet and listen to this, you ready?

Treasure Island And carry on just as if er we were proceeding immediately after the proposed excellent introduction and as if the intervening weeks just hadn't occurred. When this matter was discussed at housing committee, I believe it's only last week but it seems a lot longer ago, I spoke at some length about the errors and fallacies in the report arguing against a case that officers have put forward, pointing out mistakes and erroneous conclusions that seem to have been drawn from some very flimsy evidence. I promised members after that erm meeting that er I would bring forward different arguments tonight and that is exactly what I hope to do. I want to speak on only one angle and that is capital. Now most large businesses actually need capital. They need it to finance new projects and which they ultimately hope those projects will bring in a profit on the capital employed. But once employed as capital that money stays there, it's stuck and hopefully it earns money but it's stuck there forever until the sale of that asset is is a achieved. Many companies when needing to finance new projects have to raise more capital. This is often done by obtaining money in the form of loans, venture capital guarantees and that sort of effort. But if those forms of capital aren't available then the business has to raise capital by some other means and this is very often done by liquidated assets that they currently hold and releasing the capital for the new project. So the use of capital is fluid, right, it it's in a state of dynamic equilibrium as a biologist would be prepared to call it. And it is not it is not fixed it is not fixed or in geological terms, petrified. We in this council operate . We in this council operate a housing business with an annual turnover in excess of twenty four million pounds. Anyone who says we are not operating a business is deluding themselves. We have an acknowledged need to invest more capital to provide more housing for the most needy in our population. The way it is at present, we cannot , we cannot get more loot to put into the new project but the bank manager, i.e. the Chancellor of the Exchequer, reminded us a few months ago that the other way of funding our projects he encouraged us to look at our current assets and if possible liquidate some of that asset and fund it, or or use it to fund our new schemes and this Mr Mayor is what we should be doing. We must sell some of our houses and use the money we gain from that to fund the provision of new housing in the City. To miss out on the opportunity afforded to us by the Chancellor of the Exchequer is to deny those in the greatest housing need the opportunity to get decent low cost housing. So my the, in my mind the best way forward is for this council to promote the right to buy and I fully support this motion and I would urge members of this council to ignore the report that comes back from the housing committee. Thank you Mr Mayor. Thank you Mr Mayor erm a week is a quite a long time in housing but er er especially housing finance terms, I mean the system's probably gonna change again by, you know, by that sort of time. I think it's quite remarkable er that Councillor can come along and blindly say, well we've had a report back to housing committee, housing committee's considered this matter and the vast majority of people found it fairly unacceptable but we'll ignore that, we'll ignore that, fine, well I s'pose if you want to ignore it that's fine but I think w we do face here a a key issue and the issue of capital receipts, as you rightly say, is an important one. Now question is whether or not there is a simple ability to realise a capital receipt and use it I think, and if that were true, if what you're saying is true and there was some net gain to be made very easily then I think we would have a hard time, perhaps, refusing what you're saying. But it isn't true. That's the whole point. It is not a simple case that we can run along, sell a few houses, get the capital receipts and suddenly we can go off and have a wonderful programme and replace the assets which we have sold and when we're talking about assets in this case I think there's one crucial difference between us and you and that is we recognise that that isn't just an asset it is a person's home a person's home, that's so important an a I'm, just to talk about it as if it is is something else, y'know, just some petrified lump of cattle, petrified lump of stock money that was doing no good whatsoever, is a nonsense and I think most of us would agree that it is a complete and utter nonsense. Anyway why, why can't we easily use these capital receipts? Well there are a number of reasons, some of which are specific to the Cambridge to the context of this authority. As you will be well aware, as a member of housing committee, we do actually have faced a substantial crisis in terms of the availability of land which we can make available for building, that is one of the problems, possibly a short term problem, but nonetheless one of the problems key ones, which we face here. So we can't just realise the asset, dash out and build a house through a housing association because we have this crucial land problem. Now if our assets if by promoting the right to buy, by having capital receipts we seem to have a large balance building up, there is the distinct risk given the sort of policies that this government has pursued over time of a we will be running a risk there, we don't know what they're going to do, you don't know what they're going to do. But let's face it I mean if a lot of local authorities are in similar sorts of positions and a lot of balances are building up, well the money just might run away mightn't it it's happened before, I think it might happen again. I mean I don't, I don't believe that your government is stupid er it may be immoral on occasions, it may be wrong but I don't believe it's necessarily stupid. They've had a long time to crack a lot of these problems pardon What's the evidence? Well admit I I cannot actually bring an evidence at this point in time to support that er, that er er assertion. So if you were serious about promoting social housing over time what you would be working for is not a stop go economy in housing, not a stopped go regime in terms of halas housing finance, but a stable, a long term commitment towards er er a financial regime that will actually bring that housing through and that is something you have not done. I mean the autumn statement blindly goes a hundred percent to a hundred percent use of capital receipts. It just as go back. Now that's no way no way to run the railway I was gonna say but that's probably probably not the best choice of words in the present circumstances. But it isn't, it isn't a way to actually run a decent social housing programme. We need stability over the medium term at the very least in order to produce the units that we need, not this sort of one minute you're off, one minute you're not and again, if you were serious the resources were already there, there in terms of the capital receipts that people already had. You could've let us use some of that eight, over eight million pounds that we have stuffed away, set aside to actually promote our social housing programme. So basically, I don't think that it is a simple picture of being able to get a capital receipt and go out and use it. There will be occasions where indeed if people ar people in marginal circumstances are encouraged to buy then we will find, as the local authorities, that they will not be able to raise a mortgage in in in the private sector and we will actually have to supply the mortgage ourselves so where's the capital receipt gone? It's disappeared really hasn't it? Because we we've had to provide mortgage. So, time and time again, when you actually look at it, when you actually look at this position that we find ourselves in, there isn't an easy receipt to be made that can be used that actually provided what the business is about. Alright it you wanna call it a business the business is about provide social housing to answer housing need in this town. I don't actually really believe at the end of the day that that is something you that is rightly called business. It is a service, we are engaged in providing a housing service to answer housing need. What we plead with the government all the time is allow us a regime, a financial regime, that is reasonable and stable in order to do that. Let us not be fooled by short termism met by silly schemes that somehow promise an Eldorado which doesn't exist. Thank you. . Erm,. Yes Mr Mayor. I am very intrigued by councillor 's analogy with this counc er count er housing services by this council being a business and the Chancellor of the Exchequer being some kind of bank manager. I mean how many bank managers b force their businesses to sell off their fixed assets at a colossal discount for heavens sake. I mean if this is the way bank managers operate up and down the country no wonder the economy's in a mess. businesses are going bust all the over place. Actually erm although councillor is quite correct that we're providing a service, erm in some ways it would be nice if the government did give us the freedom to operate our business as we choose to do so. We would therefore be able to provide a much better service. Now it's perfectly now the cost er the benefits from sort of marketing right to buy is really very, very dubious erm the government has shown time and again that what it takes then gives with one hand, it takes away with another and the costs are obvious, we are fragmenting our housing stock, we are putting it, we are likely to end up with more and more with a higher proportion of poor properties and erm there's also the risk that if we do really have to be promoting right to buy we're going to have people who are probably not sure whether they can afford to buy their house or aren't sure whether they even want to buy their house. I think they should be in that particular er set of arrangements. Okay I think what we've seen in American politics in the last twenty, twenty years or so is a, an in is er an increasing trivialization of politics the er the mass media, the so called er piranhas er focus on the daily lives of presidents. We know much more about the state of Chelsea's teeth than we do about the state of the nation. We know much more than anyone could possibly want to know about Bill and Hillary's sex life er than we do er about prospects for economic recovery and this has happened to successive American presidents and it happens in part because in the U S the president and his family, and it has been a his so far, the president and his family take the part, not only the part played in England by the prime minister, but also the part played by the monarchy. The president is both head of state and head of government and in that capacity serves to some extent as a symbol of the nation, a focus for loyalty and Americans have a curious capacity for er im imputing to whoever wins the presidential election a set of er outstanding qualities. So that every American president is a sort of half breed, a cross between Daniel Boone and Jesus Christ and that however corrupt and venal a politician he might have been before, once he assumes the White House it is assumed that he changes. They talk about people growing in office always worried about people who think that forty seven year old men can grow, but there you are. Er the, the, the office itself, the trappings of the office transform the man. So even someone as obviously corrupt as Richard Nixon, people started talking about the new Nixon, new Nixon the statesman. They stopped saying, you know, would you buy a used car from this man and started talking about him as the international peacemaker. And this means, or this has an impact, this dual role as head of state and head of government, has an impact on what any president can do. Because a very large part of any president's time is taken up in the ceremonial, in the ritual, in meeting heads of states from other countries, from opening the equivalents of garden fetes, receiving parties of boy scouts, er and whatever else the Queen and her family do these days. Er and that means that the president's attention is both diverted from substantive concerns and it also means the president, there's a limitation on the extent to which the president can appear to be partisan. So the president tries to encapsulate the national interest to embody the common good and he puts forward policies, not in any spirit of er personal or partisan advantage, but simply for the good of the nation. And so you have then a political system in which you, which you have a presidency er faced by a powerful legislature, a president who is not part of legislature but who has to lead the legislature without any significant controls over it a very difficult and demanding task. Erm one of the best known commentators on the American president, a man called Richard Newstat er who's occasionally known as Mr Williams because he's married to er Shirley Williams a clapped-out Social Democratic politician of er yesteryear, erm Richard Newstat once said, well once said many things but er on this particular occasion said that er if you want to know what presidential power is, it is simply the power to persuade and that er when you look for er an American president what you need to look for er is not somebody who is clear minded, far sighted and so on but you need somebody who has the capacity the skill, the talent, to persuade other people to do what he wants them to do. It has to be persuasion because he has few, if any, powers of coercion unlike the British prime minister. Okay well if we look into the development of the presidency what we've seen is a gradually changing conception of the office. Er I said I think in the first lecture, the founding fathers saw the presidency as a check, as a control on the legislature er and er in periods of crisis legislatures find it very difficult to respond. Any group of five hundred and thirty five people find it difficult to agree on a common purpose or a common decision and increasingly, in period of crisis, attention turned to the presidency and presidents were not always willing to supply the leadership er that er the country expected. Erm presidents of the nineteenth century very often took the view that the president was not much more than a sort of constitutional monarch, er a dignified part of the constitution to use er Bagehot's phrase. Erm in the eighteen fifties, in the years immediately preceding the American civil war, the er then American president er was placed under great pressure to do something about the increasing tensions and increasing conflicts between north and south but er he declined to do so. Does anyone remember the president before Abraham Lincoln? Not many people do. Erm his name James Buchanan James Buchanan was asked to do something about the violations of the Fugitive Slave Law, this is the one that returned slaves back to their owners, erm and Buchanan said, I quote wisely limited and restrained as is the president's power under our constitution, he alone can accomplish but little for good or for evil on such a momentous question. After all he is no more than the chief executive officer of government, his province is not to make but to execute the laws. Congress alone has the power to decide whether the present laws can or cannot be amended so as to carry out more effectively the objects of law. Apart from the execution of the laws the executive has no authority to decide what shall be the relations between the federal government and South Carolina, any attempt to do this would be on his part a naked act of usurpation . So you have a very particular view of the constitution, that given by the founding fathers and one which is still in force some seventy eighty years later as America headed towards its most momentous and divisive crisis in its history. Now this is a turning point in, in American history and er cometh the time cometh the man and the man in this case was Abraham Lincoln and Abraham Lincoln took a rather, a rather different line. And I shall quote to you from er a message of Lincoln's to congress in eighteen sixty one and from some of his er private correspondence. if you remember the question that the founding fathers faced was how do you create a government which is strong enough to endure and to defend the nation and defend the country yet a government which is not so strong that it erodes the rights of individuals within it, this is the, the essence of the, the problem of government as, as the founding fathers saw it. During the er civil war Abraham Lincoln er suspended, unilaterally, without consultation, er suspended the writ of habeas corpus who knows what habeas corpus is? Right to a fair trial, any, any advance on that? We must have one lawyer amongst our presence surely. Mhm. It literally, it literally means produce the body only you can't simply, well the difference between a constitutional system and er an arbitrary government is that in arbitrary governments people get arrested and disappear, locked up, throw away the key and worry about it the next generation or after the next er military coup or whatever but in a constitutional government there have to be procedures and one of the safeguards of individual liberty is that if you're ever arrested and detained by law enforcement agencies you have to be produced before a court within a specified period and charged with something. There has to be evidence produced to say why you are being detained and you have a chance to, to refute that evidence. Er as you can imagine in the circumstances of the civil war the government, the federal government, was much vexed about the question of spies and fifth columnists and people er in the, in the northern states er engaged in sabotage and collecting espionage of, of various kinds so er Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus. There were arrests, people were detained er without trial, they weren't charged with anything but on suspicion of being spies for the confederacy. And Lincoln was criticized, attacked for this, that er and he said in response to this the attention of the country has been called to the proposition that one who is sworn as the constitution says to take care that the laws be faithfully executed should himself not violate those laws a fairly reasonable proposition you might think, if your oath says to uphold the law then you start going round breaking the law er something wrong here somewhere methinks. He goes on to say of course federal laws were not being obeyed in the confederacy because they'd rejected the entire panoply of federal laws and Lincoln goes on to point out must they these laws and the confederacy be allowed to to state the question more directly, are all the laws but one to go unexecuted and the government itself to go to pieces less that one be violated . So you get the impression here of Lincoln talking about an unusual crisis situation in a letter to one of his mates in eighteen sixty four Lincoln goes on Lincoln goes on to, in his letter to a friend to deny that civil war was fought to, to free the slaves er as a moral crusade, he wants no part of that argument. Lincoln says in a letter to his friend er Hodges in eighteen sixty four, quote I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong and yet I have never understood the presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling and I aver that to this day I have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on slavery. I did understand however that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability imposed upon me the duty of that nation of which the constitution is the organic law. Was it possible rhetorical question was it possible to lose the nation and yet preserve the constitution ? Now here we move in to a bit of Plato always be aware of those who argue by analogy by general law life and limb must be protected yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life can you guess what's coming next?but a life is never wisely given to save a limb . Pretty acute stuff eh? I felt and this is the bit I like, I, I some I, I used to set this at one point in the examination question and ask people to guess which American president said it I'll read, I'll read it to you measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful if indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation just, I'll just get the essence of that,measures otherwise unconstitutional might become lawful if indispensable to the preservation of the constitution through the preservation of the nation ninety percent put Richard Nixon er no one put Abraham Lincoln er cos he was one of the good guys right or wrong I assume this ground I could not feel that to the best of my ability I had even tried to preserve the if to save James Buchanan is essentially the Pontius Pilate of American politics he says yes these are very acute problems er and very difficult er and I'd like to help but I'm sorry I can't and I really do have to go off and wash my hands now erm and, you know, you carry on and when you've resolved it tell me what you want me to do and I'll, I'll do it. Lincoln takes the opposite view, Lincoln says here is a crisis the person uniquely placed to deal with major crises in American politics is the president and I, Abe Lincoln, stand forward and I'm prepared to do almost anything if in my judgment it's necessary to preserve the nation and the constitution. So from a view of the president as impotent and ineffective and helpless you have a view of the president as being er the action man, the crisis manager and it's Lincoln's view, the Linc Lin Lincolnian view of the presidency which has survived er an and developed with, with the odd, the odd hark back to a previous, a previous age. And you find successive presidents er claiming some special authority that the constitution doesn't give them but which they, they believe that er a accrues to them by virtue of they're being presidents. One of my favourite presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, president from the early part of the twentieth century and known as the damned cowboy erm you might be interested to know how people become president erm Theodore Roosevelt was an arch imperialist and got very excited about the er war with Spain er America had a s little brief war with Spain at the end of the nineteenth century erm over the possession of Cuba, and erm in eighteen ninety eight, and this aroused great patriotic feelings in all red blooded Americans and especially in Theodore Roosevelt and er er Roosevelt formed his own company of cavalry called the Rough Riders and erm Roosevelt wore glasses and was asthmatic but he had this group called the Rough Riders, sort of early kind of Clint Eastwood stuff, and erm anyway he g he was engaged in the war with Spain er and there was one wonderful moment in the war Spain in which the Spaniards were at the top of a hill called the San Juan hill er and er Teddy, as he was known, of course he gave his name to the teddy bear, did you know that did you? You learn something every day in these lectures. Er Teddy Roosevelt down at the bottom with the Rough Riders the guns at the top of the hill, the horses at the bottom of the hill you've heard of the charge of the Light Brigade haven't you? They were smart guys compared to Teddy Roosevelt. Er Teddy Roosevelt leads a charge of horses up hill, up hill, into the mouth of the Spanish guns smart guy, smart move how did he become president after doing something as fatuous as this? Well fortunately the Spanish were even more incompetent than he was and what the Spanish commander, instead of rubbing his hands at the prospect of er the damage they were about to wreak, he discovered that they had the wrong calibre shells for their guns and Roosevelt and the Rough Riders overran the Spanish guns a and Teddy Roosevelt became a war hero and on the strength of becoming a war hero, he become vice president of the United States, got the vice presidential nomination and in good American fashion the president was shot er by an assassin er and Teddy Roosevelt became president, so there you are, there's a there's a career plan for you to er to think about. Erm Roosevelt was er despite the er rather unusual route to the presidency, really rather a good president but he had a, he had a very particular view of the presidency which was one which he shared with Lincoln but he took up Lincoln's arguments and, and developed it further and I quote from er Roosevelt's autobiography, which is rather more revealing than most autobiographies, erm Roosevelt wasn't modest I should say in case you, if you wonder when I read you something. He says in the autobiography erm my view was that every president was a and this was a famous phrase every president was a steward of the people, a steward of the people, bound actively and affirmatively to do all he could for the people and not to content himself with the negative merit of keeping his talents undamaged in a napkin curious turn of phrase I decline he says to adopt the view that what is imperatively necessary for the nation cannot be done unless the president can find some specific authorization to do it in the constitution. I did and caused to be done many things not previously done by the president. I did not usurp power but I did greatly broaden the use of executive power, in other words this is the modesty part I acted for the public welfare, I acted for the common wellbeing of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was necessary unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative prohibition Roosevelt suggested that the president subject only to the people of the United States and he identified himself with Andrew Jackson and with Abraham Lincoln. To Roosevelt the view propounded by our friend James Buchanan was narrowly legalistic in which the president was the servant not of the people but of congress and this, to Roosevelt, was . So you get, if you like, a development here er of presidential authority and the perception of the presidency both from the point of view of incumbents and from the point of view of the American people and gradually in the twentieth century you get an increasing focus an increasing focus on the presidency as the engine of government, that it's the president who makes things happen, it's the president who fixes things, it's the president who responds to crises and as the crises become more frequent and the crises become more intense so the focus on the president also expands and the Buchanan view is now no longer tenable, the Buchanan view it's not possible for any president to play the dignified monarch. They like to do it a bit but they really can't sustain it because ultimately there's a, there's a call for action, a demand for action. In the twentieth century er the president who did most to, to develop the office further was, was Franklin Roosevelt, Theodore's cousin er and Franklin Roosevelt, who became president in, in the nineteen thirties and the time of the great depression, and remained president for, till nineteen forty five so He was president for thirteen years er and his political opponents were so upset by this that they actually amended the constitution afterwards to prevent any future president from serving more than two terms of as president, so eight years is the maximum that anyone can serve as president. Roosevelt served for thirteen years and led America through the depression, into the second world war and emerging at the other end as Oh well there was clothes and gardens and and just the same as it is now. But oh that's where the Was it the Clydesdale bank that's at the top of Castle Street? Mhm. That was and that was a grand shop. We used to all wear pinnies, white pinnies, on the top of our dresses and going to school and I used to go into old Mr n and he would say to me And what colour of the bow do you want on your pinny today? And I would say He'd wait for me to say, Blue to match my eyes. Just as a kid he would lift me up on the m up on the er counter, you know and me I was born in and then we shifted to the bottom, you know that white house, I think it's all offices now, in the the erm big gates of the cathedral. You know at the bottom of the market green. Well the house, you just went in a gate there and went up the stairs there. So it was just My mother used to see me across the road with my shilling to pay for my pinny. And one day I dro I dropped it down the the drain as I went into the shop. And I tears of course, you know, and er the poor old man he was a very small man, Mr , and er he lifted me up and told me never to mind, i could get another shilling. But I don't know whether I ever got . Or whether I got the pinny for nothing, I might have easy. Yes? Did you have to have a different pinny every day then? Oh very nearly. Oh yes, but they were just things that you tied at the back and and er had a frilled round here They were bonny. On the top of your dress. And what was the pinny for? Oh just dress. You were dressed in a clean one, you had a clean pinny on. You know, just a thing with sleeves and and er han hang loose on you. You've seen pi pictures of that surely. Was that to keep the dress clean? I don't know I think it was just to make us look pretty with a white pinny on the top of our clothes . And did all the bairns wear t All the girls wear these? Oh yes. Nearly every girl. Well when they were tiny anyway. Mhm. Well it must have been an awful job to keep all these white? Oh yes and then we Oh whenever we had anything like picnics or anything like that, we had lovely white dresses that were made of what they called nun's veiling. What could I say it was like? It was a sort of woollen soft material but very er thin. And the ladies all when they were dressed they would have a skirt made of this and a frilly blouse with a high neck and er a silver buckled belt round their waist. Did they wear very tight corset ? Oh mercy yes. Yes my aunt was Mrs David , and goodness me I can remember her having the laces pulled in. just slim waists waists. Big bottoms I always used to say . What sort of things did they have to keep their waists in? They looked terribly tough. Well just corsets like that, and they're fastened on the front with things that clicked in and then sometimes they would have a What they called a Oh what on earth did they call that? It was a thing made of whale bone that they shoved down side without fastening. And there were just as stiff as boards. Did they have to keep that on all day? Oh yes. Well did that not do any damage to their ribs then ? Well you would think so wouldn't you but it Nobody ever to say anything about it. Did did they have to wear lots of Do you remember your aunties or your your mother Did they have to lots of layers of clothes or they seem to be. Yes. And they they they very often, when they were dressed, they would have a little shawl that they would lay over their shoulders instead of a a long scarf thing you know? They'd have a little fancy shawl or My Grandma used to always have a fancy shawl that Just a small thing that came, you know, a bit down their back and And my Grandma used to wear erm a white much It was just thing like a baby's A cotton thing, tied with a just a string, you know just to erm just a tie under her chin and it would have a wee bit of lace s on the corner, or the or the end of the tie, that was through the day and it was all ruffled, and then when she was on holiday and came into town she had a a thing on her head made of velvet and it all had fancy little things in it. Very posh. Did she live in the country? She lived in Deerness. Mhm. Was it a big event to come into Kirkwall Oh yes. My goodness yes. Some some of them were never in t I well I didn't know my aunt when I met her with a hat on. My aunt. There was one time she was all dressed up to go to town and I didn't know her because she had a hat on. I never seen her with a hat on in my life before, but Grandma wore a a bonnet, when she came into town. and Grandma was the same, she had a she had another little fancy hat that she wore. Funny little things then. Did Could everybody afford to have their own horse and gig or or was there a bus that came in or? Oh never such a thing as a bus, was brakes in these days that went to the country. They didn't have a horse bus of any kind, did they? No Well Yes they had what they called brakes that came in. And erm they the w it was a place called diamonds in Deerness. Er Diamonds was the name of the farm or the place and then it came along to the lighthouse corner. New Lighthouse was the name of the house. that was one of mu un uncles that had that house and Well my cousins have it now. And then they set off from there into Kirkwall about What time? About nine o'clock in the morning. And we sat in two rows and two horses pulling at us. And did they have to stop and change the horses? No no. Just you see? No no they didn't do tat. But Granddad had a lovely little What could you call it? A little gig It wasn't a gig either, he did have a gig but he had this thing, a sort of long shaped er What would you call it ? I I've got mixed up with the names of the things. Before my time I think it's Oh by Jove it is. Er and they used to sit in that. Erm two little doors at the Well it's just kind of the shape of What could I say it's the shape of? Well there would be a seat they would be facing each other in their seats. There's a picture of Granddad in in erm that new Orkney book that came out. Erm What's the name of it? What the N David David Stanley had a whole lot of pictures and there's an awful lot of pictures in it belonging to my Granddad and Grandma. We're not in it but me cousins and uncles and aunts and everybody's in it. Is that the the one. The all the old photographs of Orkney I've seen that one. Yes. Yeah. Well if you see an old man sitting there with a a shining fronted cap on you'll know that's me Granddad, in a white beard. Is there any sort of shelter ? Well when No no. No shelter. What happened if it was a pouring day rain ? it must have poured on us but I can't ever remember it raining You know there was when we used to go to Deerness I had very long hair and we And Kirkwall wasn't just the cleanest of place at places at that time. And my hair was gingery, more or less the colour of the map you know, or a little darker than the colour of the map. And when I When it was opened out for me going to Deerness, well that was a great event. Grandma used to always say, Oh I know she's on the bus because I can see her here. And er when I went to school, Miss the old teacher, she used to take me out, er I used to go to the school ready to go to Deerness, we had to ask out a quarter of an hour early. And erm when Because we went the first day of our holidays, right away, to Deerness to my mother's people. And er I had to ask out this quarter of an hour early, well I got me hair all combed out all ready to go you see? But Miss used to take me out into here, to the teachers cloak room and and er er plait my hair up again and s say to me, I'll take it out before you go away Isa, because there was It wasn't a clean place in Kirkwall . Such a thing's never heard of nowad days I don't think. So You said that there wasn't an upstairs downstairs kind of thing at all then? Well I didn't feel it. I never I never had that feeling. We certainly were like being in the army more or less, and er there was the head servants and erm the under servants, you know? But it was er we all sort of had a respect for each other and each other 's jobs, but there was none of this erm upstairs downstairs and running frightened for people or anything like that. We all kept our place but we all It was As I said, just as if they gave you credit for what you could do. It's in er Well how can I describe it to you? But we never were made to feel inferior or er erm anything like that. I never I was never made to feel that way anyway. I just get so annoyed at this English women that wrote that book, Upstairs Downstairs, you certainly th th th We know that the butler and the cook are boss, you know. They're the They're the head ones and they're place in you're sort of in charge. But you don't rub up against that horrible feeling. What was society i in Orkney just before you left, you said you were a young girl and you left about nineteen nineteen. Yes. Was there er was there a big gap in society in Orkney, were there You know were the rich were rich and the poor were poor? Oh yes, dreadful. Far worse than anything I ever met in the south. And er there r there are no real er gentry in Orkney you see, and you'll always find that if anybody gets a a a Well as I said to one boy here, I said to him look here I said your old grandfather worked in that shop till his backside was hanging out his brigs. And I said that's the reason that you can get a car anytime you want it. I said I've lived lo long enough to know that. I said And I always say that it's the Orcad Insert one row and copy and then insert another row and copy. You mean insert Insert formulae? That's right. Over on the other side, erm you're given a range name. You got a formula. You see a range name, erm, average exchange let's say. So you same address divided by average exchange. If you copy that formula down to the cell below, what would you see? Erm. Then whatever cell was below average exchange. Erm, it would jump down one, unless you adding That cell address divided by average exchange. The cell below. You copy it down . It down erm, it would come down a different, the wrong figure. So let's, suppose you had C twenty six divided by average exchange. Copy it down you see. E three divided by average exchange. That's getting on to the right . Yes, not an absolute No. Okay, over to the other side. Erm,erm how do you check whether ho how do you check how much, how big your disk is? What do you type precisely? C H two B S blank Right. Okay. How do you find out what memory you've got? To develop into your spreadsheet? Sorry? Where's your systems ? Data Data status? No. Changed your mind on that. Right. Check disk. No, no that's on the disk. It's, you go into status Another unanimous What the unanimous decision of the team? Worksheet status. Worksheet status. Are you happy with that? Yeah. Happy with that? Yeah. Happy with that? Yeah, Yeah, I'll give you that. Don't put you off. Right, erm how does memory get used in One Two Three, Release Two? Rapidly. It, it may be true, not the answer we need. Is it column blocks? Column blocks. Okay. Bit more. One What's the key thing about memory, how it's used? It uses up all the gaps in between the gaps. The gaps in between. That's what I was after. Right. Okay, how does Release Three and want to check the Windows differ? It doesn't use the gap it doesn't use up the gaps between erm the distance working Big distances. What defines, what's a big distance? That's right, is it? When he fills up the gaps within the five hundred and twelve row blocks he gets. Okay. Er, why can't you use all of your expanded memory? Yeah. out the room. I think it's because it can't address it. I went out next. No, you were all in here at the time. on the phone Oh, were you? Oh, you might have been I but most of you were certainly here. Got as far as you could only use five hundred and forty odd or something was it Saying you could probably only use practically only five hundred K Why? Because your main memory won't take all the expanded memory anyway. Will it? It will only expand, take something Er, I'm not with you, sorry? I'll pass it across. Could you condense some Yes. When your conventional memory runs up, you can't put more into expanded memory. What,wh wh feeling slightly bigger, you get three and a half, but er what goes into conven what goes into conventional memory? What uses up the conventional memory? spreadsheet Well, I can't deny that. like erm,all the extras. The additional things. Er, it wasn't what I was after. certain things to go Yes. Okay. Yes Like formulae and things So what doesn't go into expanded memory, then? Data. It is the actual text the input bit That's supposed to go into the expanded memory. Oh. What did I say, doesn't go into expanded memory? Numbers. Well Labels. It's partly true, but Labels. No. No, I think you're on the wrong track. Is your conventional memory? What does, what what only goes into conventional memory not into expanded? Erm, I'd better tell you. It's the sixteen bytes block. That's the minimum amount of memory that gets used. That is used solely out of conventional. I'll give you half, anyway. Right, er,same again. Erm. If you find yourself running out of memory, and you're working on a spreadsheet for a while, what should you do? Save it and retrieve it. Save it and retrieve it, that's the one, yes. Right, why's that? The other side. . Why should, what does it do, if you save and retrieve? Or what I want to know is but the question is You take anything that you've in that you've erased on it and then put it back in. Yes, when you erase something, it doesn't free up the memory straight away. Okay. Erm, when you erm, erase a cell, with range erase. What do you get rid of? Everything. Just, just typing with any erm You get rid of the format. You get rid of when you do range erase. No, you don't, no you don't. Range erase, you just get rid of what's in the cell. You don't get rid of the format. memory in. Right. Yes, that's right. You don't get rid of the format. Okay, fine very generous there. Er, erm, right. How do you get rid of, what's the best, what did I say was the best way of getting rid of everything out of the cell? Copy it all in to Blank cell. Copy a blank cell. That's blank in what way is it blank? no formula No, no formula and what else is not Not protected. No protect. No labels. No. No protect, is that what you mean? Whatever. top there. There's no what at the top? No Us or No U that be unprotect. Right, and no format. Right, okay. I'll give you that. Erm. How do you get rid of deadwood? You chop What's that? I'll take a guess at you want and then it deadwood exact part of the spreadsheet, Can do. That's one way. How, exactly do you do the extract? Or what menu options do you choose? slash range. So the other question enter extract. File name extract it all in one go. file name Formulae or Oh, values or formula. Values Which of the two? Well, formulae will take the labels and everything. Values will just take the figures. There's no formulae I know that So which one you want then? Formula. Formula. Right. Okey-doke. Alright, I'll give you that. That's one way of doing it. Er, what's an another way. Getting rid of deadwood? Clearing columns and rows. If you've done a diagonal. You should be able to clear all columns the rows to the right of your Oh, right, erase Coming down, yeah all those different ranges Yeah. would you say? Right. Okey-dokey. Erm, I can't think of any questions there. Er, how can you have eight K more memory than most of you seem to have? rather than print the erm Yeah. Without getting the print wrong. How do you One Two Three, Right, that's it. Good. Right. Okey-doke. That's the end of the competition. Picked the right one on that one as well, didn't I? Most of them were wrong on this one Right. I missed some questions out Right. Linking files, copying data from one file to another in various ways. Erm so, there's various methods, we'll go into specific methods in a minute, but er, when you are passing data from one file to another, you ought to use passing and receiving areas. This is the same, in the same way that we had passing and receiving areas, of passing data from one part of a spreadsheet to another part of a spreadsheet. Erm, so you bring all the data down, passing over the simple formulae and then do one copy. So file combine is the method. You've had a look at that before. Combine at range, try and arrange all the files into another file. You only need to one file combine, that's one advantage, instead of three, so it's about three times quicker. But er, there's also an advantage of passing and receiving areas as there is before. Er, all to keep in clear order where information was going to and from. Erm, instead of you can combine directly a range from one file into another file. You can also er, another method, you could while you're working on this file, use extract to save that range of that file to a separate file,and then when you retrieve this file you can com you combine this file here. This small file to there. So you can either go that way or you go direct. Erm, the advantage of this way is it tends to confuse most of the time, but it's a lot quicker. It only takes half a second to save that relatively small range. That small file, and it only takes half a second to combine that relatively small file to there. But it might take half a minute to combine this range from this relatively large file. So in terms of overall computer speed, that method could be quicker, but I don't recommend you use it actually, because it's risky. It's risky in the sense that you change this file. You save it, but you forget to extract that range to a separate file. And then go to this file, and then you combine in this file here to there, and you don't realize it's an old copy. That's a risk, that's where you get the wrong answers. When you, when you expect that that that that takes the copy back in the old file. Oh, it does. When you do file extract, just er, saving part, it's not removing it from this. Its copying it though. Just copying it, yes. Like you do a file save. When you do a file save. Your file doesn't disappear. Right, now, the specific methods, file combine, is one method. Er, file combine has its problems, though. Anybody had any problems with file combine? Yeah. What's the problem you had? the that, sometimes you can get combine figures with, with file display, but it doesn't combine correctly, or edit properly, or edit formulae Formulae. Right that's the problem. Formulae. Er, let's look at this spreadsheet here. I've got an input number there. A number on the grid. In that cell I've got a formula, just multiply the number above by the number of the left. Then got a label and then got another formula in a cell. I want to copy those four numbers into another file. So you each give those four cells a range name, which I have already done. Range name, create data. It's not my normal name if you notice, but the name those four cells data, okey-doke. And er, I'll save the file, and er, I want to copy that data, let's say to here. Put the cell point in there. If I do a file combine and then copy and then just part of the file, so it's name you'll specify the range. What range? It's the range the range name data. So I'll type that in. Now what's the name of the file? Well, the file is called F C V. Press enter, and there's the hundred, that's fine, but this should have a thirty in it, it's got a zero in it. The reason being is that it's copied for formula across, see at the top F eight time E nine, and that formula has gone and recalculated straight away. It's multiplied a hundred above by a blank cell on the left and you get zero. So that's why, it's copied the formulas across. I didn't want the formulae. I was just wanted the numbers menu. There isn't an option unfortunately, erm, er, one potential solution er, which may well work, is to use file, combine add instead of copy, let's have a go with that one. Add main range data file F C V and ah, there we've got the right numbers, a hundred and a thirty. Look in the top left, there's no formulae. Not that we want it, just the number, that's fine. Er, what we haven't got though, is a label there. There was a label in that cell, er file combine add, doesn't copy labels. It doesn't copy formulae, it doesn't copy labels either. But if, if you don't need labels, then file combine add is an acceptable way of coping the data across. I just want to tell you, time I done that done that on a number of spreadsheets compared with the same label on one, on one Yeah, that had a label in the cell, if I had A B C in that cell. If I was to do a file combine add again. File, combine add take range. Take F C V. It doesn't know I've written the A B C, Right. so it, any, whenever I have a cell, put a label in Oh. it or a formula in it. What it also does, as you see, is it adds what you combine combining two of what's on the spreadsheet. So it's got two hundred there now. So before you do a file combine add, you need to erase first, and then do the file combine add. So that it doesn't add the numbers to what's on the screen. Now, if you do want labels, as well as the numbers. What you doing to do? Well, this is the solution. You set recalculation to manual, first. You put a slash, worksheet, global recalculation and manual and then you do your file combine copy again. File. Combine. Copy. Name range. Data, and F C V then file. Right, so there's all the right numbers, and the label. Still copy the formulas across, you notice. But the formulas haven't calculated yet. sorted out in your calculator, as soon as you combine them. What I need to do therefore, is get rid of the formulae, just leave the numbers there. How do you do that? Er, how do I get rid of these formulae, that one and that one, but leave the numbers there? Or some value. Something value, yes. Erm. Range value. Range value, yes, that's it. You do slash range value. It works just like copy does. With one difference. What's the difference? Exactly the same as copy, but there's one difference. The way copy works. copy Anything said at the back. Yes, it is. It doesn't copy the formulae. It doesn't copy the formulae. Yes, that's the difference between copy and range value. So, erm, highlight what you want to copy, which is that, and then ask where do you want to copy to. So where should I copy to? Same place. The same place, that's it. Normally when you copy, you copy somewhere different, er, which I could do, but er, I'm gonna copy it to the same place. So I just press enter. If you copy it to a different place, does it leave the blank formulas In the original place, yes. somewhere else. Use the second one just with the numbers, that's right, yes. But I've copied over to the same place, what it seems to be doing provided the cell pointed out, you're looking at the top left. You don't see the formulae any more, just the number if there's one there. So that's the solution. You set recalculation to manual, do the file from my own copy and then use range value to remove formulae So that's the file combining method. Getting data across We'll go on to another another way of getting data across from one file to another is with a special type of formula. Like this one at the top. If I type that formula in a cell on a spreadsheet. What's the two the name of the file, two greater than the cell address and it er, gets to the data from that cell and that other file. Have you ever done, used these formulae. Anybody used them? By linking formulae. You've used them Linking files together. For linking files together. Right, and there's various pros and cons to be aware of. So that's rather good. So let's demonstrate first of all how they work. I've got a file named sales one. Here it is, and erm, leave these er, on this row er twenty five, I've got a total sales figures, and it's that total sales figure there that I want to pass across into another file. Let me save this file. That's the cell C twenty five that bears the total. I've got a file called income two, and let me just erase what's here first of all. Right, so we'll type a formula into this cell, this is where I want the total sales figure to be. So type plus two less thans, the name of the file, which is sales one, two greater thans, and a cell address, C twenty five and then enter and that number one five four is, you got from that file sales one, in cell C twenty five, and I can copy that formula to the right, just like any other formula, I can copy it. Erm, there we go, and er, we copy right C twenty five E twenty five, that's it. Let me save this file. Letting me go back to the sales file. Have to change some of the numbers. Right, let's save the file. Let's retrieve the, the er, other file back again, and as soon as you retrieve it, updated it,data from the other file. So, as you retrieve it, it's updated the file. That sounds very good. You didn't have to press any buttons, it just did it. Shouldn't that be a range name instead of a cell address? Er, well, yes, we'll come to that. Wh why might you want to do that? of spreadsheets are Sorry? Well, a group of spreadsheets You put re you would want to put range names on the cell. Instead of C twenty five, you have a range name. Is that what you mean? Yeah, well I manually combine at the moment the range names. A number of range names from a number of You file combine? Yeah. Oh, I think what you're trying to say is can you combine a whole range and not just one cell. Right. Well, I'll come back to that. Let me go back to er the inco er the sales file. Let's say we're gonna research a number of products. The product er F write numbers. Here we go. Save it away. Let's retrieve the other one back again the numbers absolute type That's right, erm, I can save it with the row on the other files, but the total is now on row twenty six, but this is still referring to the same cells, C twenty five. Oh. The row twenty five is no now contains a dash blind. Erm, so that's not very good. Erm, at least I spotted it here, and I can rea realize what the problem is. Change that to a twenty six and then copy this er right. But, er, you might not have spotted it, and furthermore, you might have er, referred to another row that contains numbers. Here it was obvious that something was wrong, because you saw a dash. But you could have er, be er could now be referring to a different row that happens to have the same numbers in. Might not seen obviously wrong. So, therefore you get wrong answers. So, this is a big risk with these highlighted formulas, if you do it this way. Of course, we're always going to be inserting and deleting and moving things about, so, er, the risk of this happening will be very high. But there is a solution, and that's to use range names. So let's go back to the file again. Er, I could name that cell with a range name, that cell there, the first cell. range name create, erm, in fact, I've already done it. Th this cell, erm, C twenty six, I've named cell zero one. That cell there. Name cell zero one. Cell zero two. Name that one. E twenty six, I've named zero three, and so on. That's my normal naming convention, my normal naming convention is use the first two letters W L. W I've explained, and L stands for linking. So you have to create a range name for each cell that you're going to link. Let's go back to the other file er, I'm going to put a range name in, cell zero one on that one. Cell zero two on that one. Right, so I, I've put, got the range names on the first two, but not on the others. Let's save this file and then retrieve the er, other one back again. Let's insert yet another product. Type in the numbers save it, retrieve the other one back again. So at least the first two cells are still picking up the right two numbers, because we used the range names, we've inserted a row on the other file, but er, we're still about range names found where those cells are. Whereas here and in that range name it's still referring to row twenty six. So that's the solution. Use the range names when you file formulae. Sorry. I want to erm, go ahead and put files formulae information three files one point one down Yes, Can I do that? yes, you can have diff different opening formulae with a different part name in it. Yes, but no not into the one cell. You have to bring the two separate cells into fourth cell, total number. Yeah. Erm. You can't link a whole range to a whole range, you can only have to one cell. So this a thing you won't like about it, is that if you've got er, thirteen columns and ten rows, that means you have to create hundred and thirty range names, which you won't enjoy doing. Erm, but you really need to do it, cos the risk of things going wrong are very high, you don't Right, let's file I wanted to say a fe a few things about One Two Three Release Three, cos there are some differences on the Windows products. When you retrieve the linked file one two three, release three of four, it doesn't automatically update itself, and it does here. So what do you need to do in order to release three or four? One thing you can do, is do file admin link and that goes and gets the data from the file on the disk. It takes it then. But I don't use it, er, because it's incredibly slow. It can measure it and wait hours. If you've got a, if you're linked to a big file and you got a lot of linking formulae, you can wait hours for it to finish. So you want to avoid it at all costs in release three of four. So what should you do? Well, in release three of four you can have more than one file open at the same time. Let me show you. Here's the first file that I've got, this is the sales file, and, to bring the second file into memory in this, this One Two Three Release Three, you do file open. That leaves this file in memory, but brings another one into memory. Er, might as well move the next one in and that cell's got a file linking formulae which is updated cos of the files in the memory. Let's just create a window, so we can see both files on the screen at the same time. Right, so in the lower window, we've got the sales file, and the upper window we've got the income file. The linking formulae in that cell. If I change a number here, you'll notice,si since I change that number here it recalculates through to the other file. The two files are in memory. When you change one, the other automatically recalculates through. So if you need to pass data across from one file to another in release three or four, they don't convert the files and then they, data transfers across virtually easy Any questions on that. Right, er, we got tea or coffee or a soft drink Ten, fifteen minutes. How long do you need? Well, a little bit about managing your files. Is there a tape recorder in here somewhere? has got it By the wall here. Oh, right. That's why you're quiet over there, is it? So a bit about managing your files. Er, you shouldn't put too many files in one directory, cos then you can't find them, when you're looking for a file. You see a whole list of files you can't retrieve, you get a whole list of appearing. And, er, you probably retrieve half a dozen files before you find the one that you want. Has this happened to you from time to time? You can't remember what you called a certain file, and Yeah. it looks like it might be that one, got to try that one. Not the one. Er, is it this one? No. No, it's not that one. You can retrieve quite a few,wa waste a lot of time, anyway. Erm, what you want to do is to create lots of directories and put different sets of files in different directories. Are you familiar with directories? Yeah. DOS. Making directories. Erm, the analogy is the filing cabinets. Er, you wouldn't have a great big stack of paper in the corner of the room. Well, er, if you did, then if you were looking for something, you couldn't find where it was, you know, you'd have to delve in, and you take ages to find whatever you're looking for. But er, if you file everything away in filing cabinets, then er, you can go to the right filing cabinet, open the right drawer, maybe there's some folders in there. Pick out the right folder, if it's got a tab on it. Then maybe between various other pieces of paper, you find the one that you're after. And, find thing quickly. Erm. So. Erm, you want to put your own computer files in directories in the same way. You ever created a directory? How do you do it? Erm, you have created a sub with DOS. Created a sub-directory, right. In erm, DOS, do you do M D M D, that's right space, back-slash What does M D stand for? Main directory You, if you get the C prompt. You've seen the C prompt, have you? Mhm. And, you wanted to create a, a sub-directory off the root directories known as root directories you would type M D space suppose you wanted to create a directory named put,put your budgets in. Keep them in,press enter. So that creates a sub-directory, off your root directory, called put. You may have a list of directories as well, off the root directory, and then you've got a directory called One Two Three One Two Three programs in. Mhm. And you may have some other directories. Then if you've got one called DOS. Put the DOS programs in there All that, all I can do is pick a file out of my come under One Two Three, but if you do that in Lotus you have to do the one two three first. No, you can create a separate sub-directory. I've got one two three and a black-slash But if you put two three and I put in in the sub-directory. Yeah, that's what I mean, you have to do it on one two three. No. No, when you do make directories, you just put you wouldn't save it into Oh, I think it Saving it into one two three Yes, but once you, once you automatically. Yeah. How do you get into DOS? If you're in One Two Three of that suppose you wanted to make a directory. use it. How do you get into DOS? We have to go out I'd exit out Yeah. You could quit. Yeah. You could do, but then you have to restart One Two Three and re-retrieve your spreadsheet and all the rest of it. If you choose system from the top menu, that puts you into DOS, but it leaves One Two Three there. So you quickly get back so it's pointing at my one two three directory, so if I do M D yeah. if I do M D space put here, it will create a sub-directory, below the one haven't they? They, they are very good they are. Do you hear that . Well you always wanted a piano. Yeah. According your that is. And I wanted, I wanted Conways. I thought you were going to put that low so that if so that if this did pick it up er it didn't make any difference. Mm. You sit in there. Don't sit on there. I wish I could er well don't, don't you know, that's a record case there! Well we always clean, the carpet's clean! What when people walk in dirt? No! And you go out and you ca That's finished anyway. Have you got another tape ready. I can do, I think, stop it. How many more have you got left from the Christmas box tapes? Two, four two or four I should think. This one here, I think that's been play , that's been played on. I told you to keep the new ones separate. You'll get them all mixed up! See how it goes. They are. Oh. Good! Oh! What's that? Nothing. Baker Conway, he's is a we wanted one of his things. Yes. And you got him now for nothing. I think he went on a liner. Well he did! And then Well all of his and erm one of them lost th use of his fingers. It wasn't when they I think that was him. Probably was. I wish I'd have carried on with piano lessons. But then we used to se Your mum must have read that little finger. Then we used to sniff, you know, and Mrs come and knocked on the front door says er, our house is asleep do you mind not playing, you know. Cos er there were only four and a half inch divide in brick walls. Mm. Yeah! Mm. So I mean not double. These er, these mi might be the same, but you can't expect to have to stop sound going through a four and a half inch wall can you? We had a piano but nobody Mm. ever complained about us practising. Well, you got good neighbours then, that's all I can say. She came and knocked on the door and then we went back and I, I said what you stopped for? I says er, so I said, started playing ten minutes, she couldn't have got up the stairs and were back again! Mm! Asking us to stop. So that was it. That ended the first on my piano. I mean, you can't practise piano if people next door complain can you? Can you? Well I mean er Well most people did have pianos and er practised. Well, you know when I used to come to you walk across cos of the trams, Christmas day, all down Argyle Street every a a ev , they were bulging you know! Mm. But sometimes the door was open and they'd do it all out the front doors like this a and fresh, fresh people trying to get in. And th the pianos were going full blast! Well I told you Gordon brought his drums to our house Well one Christmas! well must have been different neighbours to my day ! You know, because we'd got a piano, he'd got a drum set for Christmas. He was about seventeen or eighteen then. I thought you said A it was nearly finished? The tape's still running. It's about finished now. This is. Sh shall I put another tape in for the rest of it? Yes, that's what I said, put a new tape in. You might have got it ready for me! I told you to get th ta , one ready! Well, still haven't got it. These have been undone though haven't they? Well I don't know. Well there's no wrapping. Well they're about to , five in a, in a big wrapper that's why they're lose. Side A. But I mean there's two at the back with individual wrappers. Mm. I don't know. Look! Well i , you're, you're the How much of these two do I expert on that. want to do? There's nothing on the . No. Well side, How much do you have? Do you wish you could go back to the good old days? No. You don't? No. Why? The wa Just making sure. The way you carried your shoes in a brown paper bag and when you were at ours. When you When you're dancing? when you were going out and the had stopped and all the girls had a you know, the ordinary paper bag with a got their shoes in there. Oh I know! I remember. They never change their shoes though now No. do they? Anyway, they all have taxis now. Yeah. True. Oh, we know this one don't we? Mm. Oh! I was always annoyed though, Phil and George were magnificent dancers and the chap I used to walk out with sometimes he er he'd he he used say now that I look like this! He used to dance like that. Behind his back, like this. He wasn't, I wasn't in it, you know, something like that. Well, you danced well when we went to . I could do park parade tha , a girl was, er er anywa , I went in the factory and one of the girls says they were saying about a dance, says ooh I quite a few you ought to see him dance the park parade! Course, I'd been to Cecille's, half a crown for an hour. Every Saturday. I went there for lessons. Did you? And er she walked on front of there were twenty of us in two rows I know how I, she walked on front doing the steps and she says I'm going to walk wi , with my back so I'm going to listen says, ooh! There's one there he he missed the step. And I said, it was m , I was called out you know a pa , a partner like I said it was Lesley! But he said no, no, no ! Oh! And then We know this one don't we? in Rushden I er see to all the girls dancing, you know, like a like you, when you were young. And I went, would she take, he says yes er half, I say, half a crown er a, for half an hour every Friday. But er I dunno er some other pe they, I always felt such a fool, you know! And they were looking at me and I thought this int my cup of tea! Turn it down a bit.. Well that's what they want to hear. I know this . I know this one. The rain in spain felt mainly on the rain! That's not the right phrase ! Mainly on the plane. The plane. Well that's er I keep getting that. Ooh I love ! Won't you just sit down! Well I keep getting up. This is a bit boring, you know,sort of jumping. Well , just sit down then! Sit down! It's a bit too loud. That's better. Where did you start dancing? I told you! I went to Cecille's. Well we would have had at school. Did you go to any church dances? We went to St. No. Pace I think it was and er i What in Grandon Street? No. That church near you, er the Imperial up Spinney Park that way. Oh no, I don't know any churches round here. Anyway, er there was er the floor was six inch three inch floor boards and they'd been danced and da They'd just put chalk down didn't they? and the nuts, yeah Yeah. they used to go out sprin and the nuts'd come above the wood. Yeah , I do know, yeah. You know. And they used to sprinkle some fresh Chalk. chalk all over. Mm! I'm pleased we've got this record now! Yeah! Aren't you? Been trying everywhere to get one didn't we? Mm. Beats all the re rock and roll don't it, really? Mm. Although, they've got some surprisingly Yes. modern ones Modern, yeah. in theirs. Di , was Madge a good dancer? No, I don't think Madge and Tom would dance much. What about Kathleen? Mm. I don't think they went all that much. Well she was young in them day anyway,an the war came along didn't it? Yes but Where's your reading glasses? You've not had them all day! No. Where are they? Down there. I know , but I couldn't see them though. I can read without them. I don't really need them. I know you can , but you're squinting. Well only, look here! You say that, look at that, can you see anything in there between the two? Yes, those lines. No. You gotta see the two dish the space in between. Yes! I can see them. I can see it. Whe where? I can see it. But, there's a all you can see is a little bright spot Mm. well that ain't the space. If you tilt it like, can just see it in her mouth, sixteenth between the two. Is it nearly finished? Yeah, it means there's ha , it's played half, another half to go. Oh. What else you going to have to eat tonight? Oh I don't want anything more. Coffee? I could do. Do you want some cake with it? No, it's I've had enough cake. Or my flapjack? Oh . You don't, you've not tasted one! They're lovely! I'll have one tomorrow, I I've look if you're full, you're full! You don't want an obese good brown sugar and butter. you don't want an obese husband do you? I don't know. I think you're getting a bit fat round the middle now! Well that's what I thought. Trousers are Well Tom is! my trousers are getting too tight! Ooh! That reminds me when I go in town tomorrow I'm going to take one of yours. Mm. To get done. Those navy ones they're the tightest aren't Mm. they? That navy pair? And they were Yeah. expensive!they were! Well if you're not going to have anything else to eat you better have some medicine. Yes. Get rid of my cough cos it Do you want, do you want some more now? it's a dry cough int it? I'll get it. Do you want me to meet you tomorrow or anything? What about No. all the library books? No, they're not due back yet. Did you want me to meet you or anything? No. I shall be alright. I've got the, the shopping all that lot today. Can you undo it? My hand's still not, not much use. Look, don't spill it! Will you ha will you have some? Not now , I've just had some. Cos I've still got a bit of a throat and it said for sore throats too if you want. Mind! You're spilling it! Well you so are you! If you get it on there. I should have had a It soothes doesn't it? wash your hands. Don't you think so? I know what to do! Bring me a hot towel and a ! Ooh! You'll be lucky! Don't go down the mine No. Look! daddy! Don't go down tonight. Well this isn't it. What is his name? Erm Used to be a tearjerker. Then it was the boy stood on the burning decks. Oh! Shut up! That was another one. Now tomorrow , all I've got to get is meat. And you know for your dinner Mm. will you have that shepherd's pie? Mm. I don't know what I want. It's got to be got rid of I suppose int it? Well er, I made a big one. Unless we put it out for the cat. You cheeky thing! For the birds, more like. There were two cock blackbirds this morning. No, will you have, you're not very keen on fish. So I'll get a bit of fish for myself. I think that's putting it mildly! What? You remember in France, the er they made you where we kept walking round the table and er she sa , anyway said er fish soup? And you said yes. And he turned to me I said not likely! She says, why? I said cos it's smells the place ! He he er, he he got a bit humpy! I don't like the bouillabaisse. Well that's no. Although, at that place it was alright but Mm. it's not one of my favourite ones. What was your favourite? What is my favourite? Mm. I don't know. It still is then, I suppose, by that. Well it What was, means the past but is, means the present. You can tell you made reminiscent with your slang What, and I were brought up in church? How did they expect them to talk down there? We used to say are you gorrit ? Well you needn't put it on there You don't, you don't hear that now do you? Well don't put it on there! You do in some parts of Leicester. Do you? Listen to me! Well it soon be spring now, I suppose. Well we're getting to the Operation dig up! It won't! We've got all the bulbs to come up fo , yet. Mm. They're a bit hesitant at the moment. No they're not! They're shooting through. This side's not as good as the other one is it? No. That's more gen gentle innit? That's waltz. I think that Welsh dresser looks better without that teapot on it now. Well i i li It didn't really go with the rest of it did it? what you win at darts at the fair int it ? No. No. But I mean it didn't really go with the rest of the things. Well no, well he said that but Yes. Only worth ten pounds then. Yeah. Somebody else'll have it ti , ten years time. Bottle of whisky. What does Bill do now, these days, do you reckon then? We don't know a Bill. Has he found any , no yours er Martin's then. Martin's boy? I don't know. He didn't seem to Well he's got his allotment and he helps Tina doesn't he? That's not much of an allotment now is it though? No, but he I think the garden is old. Yeah. Although, somebody said they thought he might er, give it up this year. Mm. I wonder what George's garden like? Who George ? Mm. Ooh! Don't you remember once we went round, he'd got a lovely garden! And then went and it was all overgrown Yeah. And then the next time, a few years later he'd got it back Mm. he'd got it nice. Oh yeah. Didn't he have a railway running a model Around. railway? Yes. A ste , little steam loco? But, I expect erm as he was in all last year I should think he He didn't bother. let it go. I mean, Catherine said Mm. was suffering from that operations so Yeah. and I bi , you know that big loft I helped get the, get the la big lathe he bought from the Mm. firm. Well he'd got a, the little marker,th well about two and a half feet marker. I says, er don't you use that now? He said, no. I said, you ever thought of selling it? He says, well no, not really. He says I'll er do it up I think an , what he did he painted it you see. Well we went over two or three weeks later and happened to mention it he wanted two hundred pound for it! Well you could had it. Well no it's he didn't give two hundred pound for it, and he'd had it eight or ten years. Anyway, I've no use to Well I think he's getting back into circulation now. Wi with ringing me Yes. er up today. And he was going to this er Mm. apparently, a friendship meeting or something, for elderly people in the village. And he was giving a lady across the road a lift there. So cos apparently, while he was on the phone she came knocking at the door then Mm. and he said, well wait a minute while I answer the door. And er he apparently told her to sit in the car while he finished his Mm. conversation with me on the phone. Did he You were in the garden so I couldn't Yeah. fetch you. Will he marry again? No! No! Old Kath said he did didn't she? No. It was about fours years. And I, and Ma , and I was saying about Ma , you know,Ma , happened to say Madge, you know, and er er, you know we said that th , that I weren't going out. And he says, oh well er something now, I forget, what was it? Oh he said, she, she Well Kath was a very I should think she's being very ge ge er er, er given her a lot yo yo you know. Wha what he's done and what, you know. And I nearly said, but I didn't, I I I could have said, well, look what she got er out of her her husband. You know, those . Mm. You know, she never mentioned that, yet she mentioned what Vince were doing now. I mean, fair's fair int it? Still Yes, but Kath is a sort of er very Up and down with No , loving person isn't Yeah. she? I mean, a very fussy person, she likes somebody to fuss over. And er, he seems Never fussed over me when I've been in her vicinity! Yeah cos you're , you're my husband, you're not her! If you go round the other side please Ann. Yes I did call you Dominic didn't I? No I mean you There. mustn't leave it there too long. Do you? Your marvellous cyclamen! You don't leave there do you, all time? Ooh no! Er indeed we've we hardly use that room since we had the territory room because that would grow Oh that's right . so well! Mm. And you see it's I should take it out now. I feel very ill! I will. What's that darling? The cyclamen, because I I've Oh! It's so useful and we've seen it and enjoy it. I think I'll use it . is so very warm for it It's lovely, mm! there but It's simply glorious! Hasn't it done wonderfully! You ought to in that glorious bowl! last Ooh, no look who's here! Yes, I know. If you put them in a hot room they don't do so well. Put it in there. I wonder what it would it look like in there? Ooh yes, it would, it would perhaps I mean Exaggerate. Mm. Oh yes, I wouldn't dare ! It's been broken twice in my lifetime. Yes I know. Mm. Yeah. This wine is a shot in the dark. It was very much recommended by the Wine Society an Italian wine and I hope that I hope it's not full of this thing they're sending it all back for! Ooh I hope not no! We won't try it ! Well that's lovely! Considering its name,was as cheap white. There are limits to what I'd dare and This isn't a cheap wine!

If perhaps you were to spread erm a wire netting over the pond Mollie? Well yes I know, but I'm not having that! But erm what I am going to do but I can't do it until the spring erm at least until erm has cut the grass for the first time Mm. erm, out there. Then I'm going to do what is the proper thing to do which is chop that to size With the same as that , yes! Yes, Oh yes that that and farm and Yes. this black so many creatures black stuff Yep! so they could be thrown over Oh this behaviour, no, they're so inflexible with their programme! Three feet from the wall from your you see, and they get their I see! feet tangled Yeah. but I can't, it's no good doing it now because you see erm dogs can get in at present and Yes. and rushing about and You needn't do anything horrid to them, terrible! I mean,you can just er Oh no! a wire cage they, no just go away. I mean I've seen it them. they don't like it. No. They're incapable No. That's right. because of the erm it's not wire, it's No. just a a thread, you Oh! see? And they get a bit Mm. Mm mm. My father always used to do that for his crocuses because the birds loved the yellow ones, don't they? Mm. Mm. And his daffs, he was going to use his, lose his yellow crocuses of the year so he spread black cotton Oh yes mm. Mm. and they jolly well learned Yes, I know, simple. that that's what Oh yeah. that it Mollie. was there! Mm. So we had to get used to the ending up in Mm. black cotton against the sparrows I used to get really fed up with it! Poor little things! And I thought I'd got I understand now what it was. knowing erm why all the purple cro crocuses good cook and I thought I've got no And at nights I used to feel like and I had got cos they've come now haven't they? Ah yes, that's And I right I told you! All I've got all morning, Mm. and I've got clumps of of snowdrops where I'd and some where I didn't know even know I had snowdrops and Mm. now I have found those lovely little erm wild purple crocuses Mm. I couldn't Good! think what their was? Right in the middle of a plot needless Mhm. and they're all coming out! And they're round Good! my ! Good! And so I, I've found that there but I've, but I've lost my baytree. Mm. How much But that's moles. Mm. Oh moles! Oh dear! Well they got down in the grass you see. There's quite a lot of them again this Mm. year. They got them, mm? They have a lot again this year, moles. Will we? Mm. Well I've got millions! Well I Have we? I must ring erm r Eddy and ask him if you get them ? I don't know whether you can get them wi weather like this. Oh! Why do you say there are more Noel? Well I don't know why we've got more, but we've got a lot. Oh I'm sorry! I thought you were prophesying. We've got some have we? Mm! Well I didn't know. Oh! Even in the back now. That is the . Mm. They come from a bank and a ditch always. Well you've certainly got them. Well I've never get it before now right? Now who is Eddy ? Well Mrs 's son. Oh! And erm, when I said to them because he's sharp so she says. My . Well he's wonderful! And the wo mind you, he's much too heavy for me but of course, well my father was and they're arm things but I must get some fresh. And, I said well I don't know what I'm going to do without Jack because he was so wonderful with my moles last year he said you haven't had me yet! Oh! No erm, so I thought well Brilliant. if he thinks he's as good as that then have him. Trouble is, if you remove moles you just leave an evolutionary niche for them and they're another lot move into the field, you can never get rid of them because if you remove your own private moles another Mm. lot come in, you see. Mm. Oh how lovely! But do you mean that they wouldn't try and Oh they're really lovely! visit if you had your own moles? Well no, but they won't over-densify, they wo won't make the population too dense, you see. I see. And th , you know,the they might spoil Might be things. mine come in Yes, I'm sure they will. and they go over the fields. Yeah. Yeah! And there are hundreds of the wretched Mm. . Mm. I consider four moles are too dense. Mm. Yes. One mole is too dense for me! Mm. Cos they always get under your favourite plant! Mm. Fay, can I pass you some more vegetables up?

Just eating a sandwich! How could you? Cheese sandwich. I don't know! Mm. And it clicked and I, well occasionally before and very occasionally and I Might have I just the slightest sort of movement has readjusted it and this would not move at all! And erm I'm shovelling food now because it's so difficult! I still can't get it any wider . Really? Mm. Nope. Mm. Drop more wine Mollie? No thank you, I'm alright. . By the way those did I tell you they put me on some tablets to re to erm to erm No. relax the muscles, Really? Yes,. Well there must be something in it because I feel so relaxed these days I can't get oh really! Well that's nice! Don't flap about anything! Well er No quarrels.

But she can be very , she can be very secluded there. Mm. Mm. She can be just . I reckon she wants to Oh it's a lovely little lane I've I've always loved that lane. I know you think I'm Have you ? Have you? Yes. And lives on there. Well I've known Derek since I was six weeks old. I was taken there for the first time when I was six weeks old in a motor side car down from London to just within ten miles of Bury St Edmunds. Why I didn't die I don't know! We well, a motor side car! Yes, absolutely! I'm astonished erm because my grandmother wanted to see her first grandchild before she died. Oh yeah. And she died about two months later. At six weeks, You see I Connie. Really? and Connie, Connie's six weeks younger than I and grandma never saw her. Oh well she did but she had a grandson before that, she had a grandson who was born in eighteen ninety three and his name was on . I don't even Oh really? think that in those days anybody would have considered taking a child out like that, you know! They do it now! That's right. It drives me In a car me up the wall! Erm the things they will do for these new little things. I never used to feel I know. that mine were really here until they . Did it have a lasting effect on you Mollie? Well, you can be the judge of that! No,got it I think, yes! But then You don't like motorbikes and side cars do you Mollie? It's amazing really! No. Well I used to ride a motorbike a and my father had a Triumph motorbike because he bought I don't why he, why he bought it and he was terrified of it cos it was very fierce! And my brothers used to ride it, so I used to ride it and I rode it for miles! Did you? Then I rode it in a in an old Burberry and I don't how I started it, I think it was kick start. Mm, yes. Oh it must have been. And then we were at Frinton, masses of us, and we always used to go to Frinton in the summer because one of my uncles had a house there and we knew the people who erm dad used to play golf and mother used to knit on the beach, you know. Oh yes. Mm mm. And we used to th masses of cousins there and erm one one of my Jean, my cousin about ten months younger than I said, can I have a go Mollie? And I said, yes you see, gave her a try and so she went if you know Frinton you could go, in those days Yes I know it. you could go round, well it's the same now, but in those days you could go round, past the summer theatre and down Old Road where we were staying and on to a and do a circle you see? Mm. And we started her off and she went round and as she went past the second time she said I can't stop! Oh! oh! oh! Oh no! And then she went round again and we said well push so and so Oh my! How awful! And nobody had told her how to stop you know. I can remember not being able to get off my sister's much bigger push bike, just an ordinary push bike Oh yes! and I pedalled frantically round, didn't know how to get off again cos it was much too high. And I remember just sort of leaping onto some grass and just letting it go, you know, could of been . Oh I remember them emphatically Oh yes! now,. Yes, I know, I probably learn you see because I borrowed when I was about twelve and I remember bashing into a nanny with a pram. Oh, she was furious Oh dear! with me! I bet she was. I bet she was. cos of nowadays, well they didn't then because she was beastly to me now! Oh ! Now this is where the meal gets a little bit French because I have sauce to deal with. So you are left with erm conversation I'm going to top your glass up with a No thank you darling. No. I had an experience with a bike when I was very small a girl up the road was given a bike and I had quite quietly learnt how to ride a bike more or less. Mhm. And I, I said can I have a ride? And she said yes. And I went up and down the road and miles away then came back and I couldn't stop because this bike was very old fashioned and you had to stop it by pedalling back I know. pedalling backwards! Oh yes I know. I've heard of them! And I I I remember those. Well! pedalling backwards Mm. and I said there are no No. brakes! There are brakes! No. Oh dear! Anyhow I steered it straight up somebody's drive into their garden. Oh yes, up a hill or something. ! No. How awful! I've never ridden one but I've heard of it, with this back Yes, I've heard of it. Oh yes, that's right. Yeah. Be quite good, although you maybe do it by accident sometime and be rather jerky! That's what I thought earlier. That's very sudden you Oh! see. Mm. Back pedalling, mustn't you? Hey? Yo , you might stop sort of suddenly. Stop very suddenly. And then you'd Yes,yo well I I I yeah, no I have actually got No. th ridden one. No, I never have But certainly but I have of that. Well no not But I can remember riding this girl's Mm. bike can't stop! Can't stop! ! And so er er can Mm. remember riding up Mm. up this slope into a Yes. onto grass or something. How are your erm, I heard about erm, I've erm heard Sebastian lately but how is little Romley getting on, is he alright? Oh he's fine, yes! The Mm. they make too much fuss of him and they bring him back Yes. too often but Mm. Yes. Good! And John has got an order to build a new Orkingford Chapel. Oh at Which would John's! At John's. Oh how lovely! Oh have they, good! Yes. Mm. And that's the second one Oh that's lovely! since the war. Mm? They had Is it? Is it really? they had new one after the war. Why do they want another one? It's just isn't satisfactory. How extraordinary. No. John's gotta build a new one. Oh! He's not complaining? No. No. And at your old stamping ground. Gotta For what? to build one for Chelmsford Cathedral. Mhm. Really? I'm off Chelmsford Chelmsford? Cathedral! It's ghastly! I gather it is. And so is the bloody Bishop there! Yeah but he's Absolutely awful! very nice. And erm if you wanted to hear about Chelmsford Cathedral when Estelle who was a humorous and eighty something but still on the ball she'll tell you about the Who? Chelmsford Cathedral. Estelle . Who is that? sister. Oh sister! Oh yes And I've met her, I've met her! and erm ooh she's marvellous! Yes. She's be ,ei , eighty six and she lives alone and she's she's absolutely ge again, the Arch Deacon, it's the Arch Deacon there that's the trouble! He got a bulldozer to bull , to bulldoze up the erm aisles and bulldoze the sanctuary and he's thrown away, God knows what! I mean there are, there, there were erm all sorts of things there. And his, and he got rid of the beautiful eagle erm you know, reading desk and he got rid of the Bishops's erm, chair, the Bishop's what do they call it? Oh yes. Throne? The Bishop's throne! And he's put all wrought iron one there! Yeah. Well I Absolutely furious! Sh she won't I haven't been in go near it! Do you know what she does? On is the erm erm, nearly next door is the old erm Quaker Chapel Oh yes. the most beautiful building and nobody can pull it down, but Not the chapel Mollie? No, Not . Meeting House. Meeting House Meeting House yes. And opposite her is where the erm Quakers meet now because they can't afford to run the chapel the erm Meeting Meeting House. Meeting House as a big one and they are getting fewer. But she says I sometimes just walk across the road and go to the Meeting House at you know Well I've got a theory rather than the cathedral. Yeah. I've got a theory I have a feeling there's going to be a great revival of people with a Quakered mind way of thinking. Yes I I Yes. do agree. But the trouble is Noel, in the meantime erm the Quakers have fallen apart because the Quakers have filled themselves up with sort of barefooted raw carrot eaters with beads Well I know they have, yes I agree. with the and haven't, but haven't ever read That's right. the bible sort of Eastern religion type, meditation and thing and it's no good at all! The old fashioned Quakers who were sikhs and everything. Mm. Now, what I have learnt at college this week which is rather interesting I think. Well I think you'll be interested. Erm in the bible in the new part, the new testament, there's a er an epistle of James. Yes. Mm. Well I am told that that is the earliest thing at all. I'd say that. That is his erm actually a brother of Jesus in his family Yes. and so it's very much as he was thinking and it should be in the old testament really cos it was written you know, before Jesus Mm. That's right. before the, before the crucifixion. Erm, and it's been quickly Christianized with just two little lectures at the beginning of two chapters to Christianize so it was popped in for new testament and it's the nearest we can get to to teaching. And of course, it's totally Jewish Mm. but I'd say it's th it's th Je , the Jewish teaching as Christ would have preached it Mm. you see and it's for all the family. And there's, towards the end of the first chapter there's a bit all about erm erm er temptation and deliver us from evil kind of thing which is obviously rather from the, from the Lord's Prayer and yet it's, rather explained rather nicely and it, it's a lovely, lovely book! It's only five Do you know, I haven't ever read it. I will do of course. I've heard about that. It's lovely! It really is lovely! And you really feel that here is a I shan't be able to walk home! Really? It seems to be Mm. everything sort of, in a nutshell, you don't need any of the rest Oh well! of the new Mm. testament, that's just quite enough, it's just a just th the Jewish thing filled out slightly and and and a little bit less rules and, you know,i it's very, very lovely! Well apparently Chelms I've never read it , but I shall. We'll have a go, yes. Well that's what Chelmsford's got you see, Chelmsford was was full of Quaker! I mean, I can, I can erm quote the Quaker the families who still live there. Yes. Oh, all the important people were Quaker families when I lived there you see? And the erm the . The , I was gonna say them. Oh the were appalling! Ah yeah, the , the and I knew them. Oh yes! Yes. and erm What about the ? They're still there apparently The were Oh yes, they're still there! and the were the Norfolk more weren't they? Mm mm? Were the Norfolk more, were they? I think they were. Yes, I I mean I can't remember they and the and . By the time I can't remember now but they're at least five. I was thinking of them the other night, well they er, five at least erm they were th they were Quakers. But er ,,and something else, I can't remember them. I di , I always think of the , I met one or two of those. They're A when I go through Oh Mrs , off the train and still standing there with her name on her side. Mm. Yeah, that's right. Mm. Yeah. Oh they're lovely people! But er They ran everything. I'd been per wo ah I I feel that all this doctrine res religions are spoilt That's what I said! by doctrine. Exactly! Oh no! Nobody believes That's wrong! any of it now! I mean I think No I know. I know. Yeah, it's terribly sad! It's terribly sad! I think it's . Even the Bishop of Durham, I've just recently bought one of his books and I rather wish I hadn't, I'm not liking it much erm he's still much too orthodox really. Is he? You know he's still hanging on to Oh he is ? and trying to Mm. show Well I mean you can't you Mm. you can't get fish from prize thinking fish No. can you? No. But I know they blamed him for that. And he says you can because he says it's important for it to be a living thing that's got to change with the time. Mm. In all that way he's quite correct Mm. I think. It's just that he hasn't, to me, changed enough, he's still stuck up with all these various things. That really Well I know let's face it, if he, if he was really convinced of the falsity of most it he Mm. couldn't be a conscience to obtain his seat could he? Well he reckons you can say it in a different way. You can say Mm. it entirely symbolically and spiritually and and Mm. things don't Mm. have to have happened in fact. And that the stories were told to make a point and Mm. the trouble is, people have lost the point and kept the story! Erm, you know, it's saying that Well, the earliest man who used to think like this was Albert . Yes, oh yes course it Yeah. was! He wrote that marvellous book! Oh Well a lovely book! I've got about six of his books in there! Well I had all of his books. famous No, er, you mean erm I know quite a few . The er Christ, the Historic Jesus. Yes. With that famous last That is his best book chapter which is so lovely when Yeah. he sort of says well you still can spiritually meet Jesus even though you know, it's a rather lovely the last chapter! I say, he moves him the more you search for him historically Yeah. but there is a there's something hanging about still. But in a funny way, perhaps there is. I don't know. I'm very very, very, very, tied up with it, I I I invariably turn relatively happy with it all. I don't think one has to worry too much. Been brought up so much, bought up a Christian Yes, you just find it difficult to to admit that one's rather you know But certainly that epistle of James, to me, was just marvellous! Just everything! I, I can't Mm. ever remember reading James, If I had, I've forgotten about it. Mm. But I shall read him tonight. Well certainly, you'll enjoy it. Oh Did you go to 's er ? Yes. Er I chose the reading. Oh did you? Oh Yes. how lovely! Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yep. It Erm was very nicely done! Louis was very upset cos she forgot to erm have anyone to take the names erm Well so I wrote down as many as I could think of Mm. and erm and I asked Margaret , they had a better view where she was Mm. and she told a lot of other people and so I think we got a pretty comprehensive list actually. Oh, we couldn't er we No. we couldn't go anyhow. No. It was very packed in there but I couldn't see a lot of anything. But I was glad we couldn't because they asked me to read the lesson. No it it's miserable! Oh yeah. It spoils everything doesn't it? I'm glad to say Mm. and stuck to it. I think there were some people there who didn't really know, but they maybe went because they'd got to a funeral. Well it wasn't erm Oh it wasn't quite full enough. I think that's awful don't you? I I do, I do Mollie! But, we're doing the right thing for I the wrong reason. No this was probably, a relatively That's original idea. that's the, that's the wrong thing to do! Straightforward from there. Just having a cremation cos you're talked into doing something . I was, it's not a very And it's not very popular now. after. I must say, David worshipped rather well. but steered round it, saying how he admired them You said it. you're obviously going to make his daily up and down the village and and er I said one or two things You know, things you could say That's quite Erm true. and he did decide that I would like a cup of tea I wanted to say he had a great dedication. and she said that if you couldn't go, or telling him. And he was the only man in the British Legion who'd ever bought That's right darling. a drink. I I can manage see me any time you want. No, I did come . He didn't like. David He didn't. me and I usually always tell him off. and I've met people there who I know I knew. Yes, that's true. And I That's true. Absolutely! Oh sorry! But I thought it wasn't No, no, no, that's right. No, when people are dead you must See you bury them. Now Mollie that's, I haven't given you a large helping but it's a ginger pudding. I've been dying to make a good ginger pudding for years! I like ginger pudding. So wait and see if it's any good, I don't know. There now Mollie, there's some cream. Erm, sorry, some custard. Sauce! No I'll I Sauce. Oh sauce. Erm, is a, is is sauce essential? I should think on this. It it Okay. moistens it. It's an egg custard so it's, you know it's worthy Oh well of your attention. I have, if you Oh! don't mind but I don't like Heavens! Come on have some ! I don't like normal cream on everything. And it's only small helpings because you can come for more, okay? Normally I'm staged up providing your steering is smooth,positive and accurate,then we accept it. It's no real problem. So we realize we're not gonna be here to change the habits that have built up over a lifetime. You can't change habits like that b in two or three hours. But if there was an aspect of your steering like erm Right now listen folks. sh sh sh sh sh. Can I remind you please if you're answering a question can you please put your hand up so I can select . Some of you know Now way back a couple of weeks ago when we were doing the group seven the one that's spelt F C L B R I A T. Hands up who can remember what any of those stand for without looking on er You forgot the first rule put your hand up. Right fluorine is the actual element fluoride is the stuff that's in? Toothpaste. Toothpaste very good. You never put your hand up. Right C L Please sir is chloride Chloride is the is when it's joined up with something chlorine is the element. And what do we get chlorine in? Swimming baths. Swimming baths to? To take away all the nasty To kill the germs. Well it doesn't exactly kill them kill the it's got it's own smell which sort of tends to mask the smell but it's also basically to kill the germs. B R? Bromine. Bromine very good. And I? Iodine. Very good excellent. S so what I want you to show you this morning is how we can actually make the chlorine. So the people at the front yeah if if you come up a little bit closer. Now sh sh sh sh. Please Now I've got erm a bottle which is actually contains some chlorine here but it's not called chlorine liquid. I'll scratch this. Hydro Chloric. Chloric. chloric acid and it also says C O N C. Conc what is conc short for? It's short for a word yes. It starts with C O N C. Anybody? Conc is short for? Nose No conc er it's the beginning part of a word. If you use the word conc you're just meaning your nose . Conical. Ah now we're getting a bit more scientific. Conical if it was conical it would be C O N I conical. But it's conc. Now can you think of a wo c think of a word that describes the state of this liquid. And I'm going to hold the top while I show you. It's rather oily and it's quite a a dense liquid. Is it dangerous? It is dangerous yes. I'm gonna get some goggles on in a minute. What do you call liquid ah I'll give you a clue. What do you call a liquid that's very very strong? Concentrated liquid. Thank you concentrated. Now I Goggles on time folks. Now in this particular case I'm using a tap funnel Tap funnel just as it's it's Erm the concentrated acid you don't just sort of pour it in and run away and leave it to it. Let it in a little bit at a time. Just slow Slowly let the acid in. Then turn it off. Right now so the tap is to control the speed at which the acid goes in and if there is any gas that's in there it can't escape out of that pipe again it's got to go down the other pipe. So it's a safe it's a safety feature and it helps control the experiment. So we control the speed at which the acid goes in. And once it's in there it prevents the gas from escaping. Now at the moment the black chemical that's in there is not doing a great deal. The black powder's just sort of gone to a a sludgy paste . The powder's just gone it's dissolved a little bit but it's not really doing much on its own. So in order to speed it up a little bit we might need need to heat it up. Who said that? Me. Well done. Now who's going to go next door to get the gas switched on? What? Right Listen again sh sh sh sh sh. Done it. Sh Now in order to help this black powder to split up the acid. We're going to have to heat it up a little bit. Now again I'm treating it carefully I'm not just sticking the bunsen underneath and blasting away at it. I've got the Graham wanted to well unfortunately Graham this one's a bit dangerous so I'm having to do it so if anything goes wrong it's me that gets it and not you. Well because I've got all the dirty chemicals Sh. Please. Erm How will we know how will we know if there's any gas escaping? What. What's this paper? P H paper. P H paper. So I'm going to moisten it. Because of the gas that's drifting around in here What? The gas can you can you set fire to it? No it's not a flammable gas. But it is poisonous so if I start smelling it I'm going have to switch the cupboard on to suck the fumes away. Lorraine. Now this P H test I've only had it a few seconds and already look what it's done to the paper. Where I've wet it what's it done to it? Turned it yellow. It's turned it yellow and where it was dry it's now going what colour? Red. Red. Red means it's An acid. an acid. And because this takes what do you call something what do you call something that takes the colour away? Bleach. those are old pieces of paper. Come on somebody what do you call a chemical A what? Not a neutralizer. Andrew? We call a chemical that takes that takes Now you'll see it. What colour's the gas? Green. Right it's a green gas and it's also what it does it to this paper turns it acid to start with and then takes the colour away it is a bleach. Bleach gas. Now because it was frothing up I've turned the bunsen off to control the reaction it's slowing down again now. And you can see the colour. What colour's bromine on that list? Black. Black. What colour's iodine on that list? Black. Blue. Not it's not blue. Purple And they're all poisonous and they will bleach this the be this is probably the best bleacher. This is highest the highest up up the list that we can do. We can do reactions from F too dangerous. Now sh sh sh sh sh sh. Now this one I'm going to show you this one this time. Karina? Mm? Why do we use the tap funnel again? Cos we've got a tap funnel. so if there's any gas Yeah right it can't get out it has to go down the pipe. Sir? Stop shuffling. Sh. Can anybody oh I bet you'll never guess this one. Why have I got a conical flask instead of a round flask? Here's the answer. The round flask is broken. Erm I've go some purple crystals believe it or not. now this one's a bit more powerful this purple chemical. Shouldn't need heating up. If I put this white if I put the white paper behind the flask, can you see the gas that's in there? Yes a yellowy gas. Yellowy gas right and Sir? Yes? Is that flammable? It's not flammable it's poisonous it's acid and it bleaches. It could yes in the in the First World War er they used It would But how long would it take? It depends how much you got into whether you had asthma or not. You might you might have after you've s had some of this. Now can I explain this part over here look at this. Sh sh. Er right I've got this contraption upside down leading into a a trough of water. Can anybody guess why? There's something else that this gas does in water. If you'd got enough gas it would make bubbles. But we've only got a small supply remember. It may do . What do what do things normally do in water. Sometimes they move yeah. Anything else if you just put some Right they sink or float. What else do they do after they've either sunk or floated? Rust. They might rust yeah. Or turn to a well what do you call it when they turn to a liquid. What's the word? They what? They liquidize. Liquidize. They liquidize but you can liquidize things by heating them up that would liquidize them but in this particular case you just mix them with some water what's the process called? To turn it into It's called what? If you stir some sugar into water. Dissolves. It dissolves okay. If this gas if this gas dissolves too quickly it'll suck the water back up the tube and into this flask. It could be dangerous because if you're sucking water into acid you could have problems. So Lorraine I've got this upside down funnel and that prevents the water from being sucked up. How do I know I've got some chlorine in the water. Well look what's happening to these test papers. They're not acid any longer what's happened to them? Mark what's happened to that that test the P H paper there? It's all gone white. It's gone white what's the pr what's the pr what do we call it it's been? Bleached. Bleached. So I've got some bleaching yeah smell you can smell that bleach. I've got some bleaching chemical. Wave it past your nose you don't sn Don't don't just I'll just wave it past your nose. You don't want to much cos remember it is er poisonous. Anybody else want no? You want a smell? Right. So sh sh sh sh sh let's just sum up. What was the liquid we started with? What was the liquid we started with? Erm oh that conc Concentrated hydrochloric acid. It's got chlorine in it. We used a black chemical to start with but in order to that to help that we needed some heat. And this one works on its own this purple chemical is more powerful and works on its own. Adam can you go and turn the gas off? Right now I don't know Mr. 's trying to book some. What? Erm science trips. Where to? Somewhere in The Science Museum in London? No no no erm somewhere in Yorkshire. Somewhere where? Somewhere in Yorkshire. Er yes a gas gas gas fired power station . Right can you go back to your places. Right now Sir have s have you seen Pride and Prejudice and the telly? Can you look after those folks. Well well did anything happen when I put the acid in? Did any any of you three see what anything that happened in the first one. so we had to put some a bit of heat in. Nothing happened acid on its own. Now we got . Let's Right excuse me. too small. Erm does anybody know what this M N O two business is? Have a look on your your periodic table and see if you can work out what M N O two. You should know what O O stands for. M N O two anybody? Nitric oxide. Something oxide yeah. Part way there come on M N have a look on your page one of this module. Work look up what M N stands for. Anybody worked it out come on M N O two. Magnesium. Very close but not quite right. Not magnesium. Have a look look very close it's not mag it's No oh that's capital N this is a little N M N. That's it right. M N Oxidizes Go on read it what is it? Magnesium. No have you looked closer. Manganese. Manganese manganese oxide. Please. There you go. Manganese oxide erm the back row decided. Manganese oxide. Erm Excuse me sir thanks sir. universal liquid. Or a piece of universal paper or . What does K M N O four stand for? What does K stand for anybody work that one out on your periodic table. K for anybody remember cos we've done this group. What's this paper paper called? P H. Yeah that's P H. Yes it is. No not chrome. Anybody what's K? Potassium. Well done. Yes I know because it's come from an old an old word an old . Er K potassium yes. Erm then we've got a manganese K M N O four. It's got two metals . How which one's got most which one's got most oxygen in it the K M N O four or the or the M N O two? M N O two. Why? That's a guess. Well look at the numbers. M N O two K M N O four. Oh I thought K M N O four. Yeah why? Cos it's got number four. It's got four oxygen atoms and that's only got two oxygen atoms. Well done Michael. So K M N O four's got more oxygen. Erm what does this word property mean in number four? Property. Now you're gonna tell me a property is something that you can Yes something that's good about it very good. So what's what what are what's chlorine got that say no other gas has? It's a germ killer yeah anything else? Er. How would know it if I brought a jar full into the room? Smell it. Smell it. Right erm what else. How would we know a jar was full compared with an empty jar. Just to look at if the lid was on. You can see it. Why? You can smell it. No we've the lids on this time. Sir it was oily and you can see it. No that was some drops of acid that you could see We're trying to work out what the properties of this gas if you're not listening you won't be able to do number four. It's smelly it's yes it's poisonous yes that's a property good. Another one? Mm that's a use not a property. What colour It's yellowy green yes How we doing folks? Good. Sir I've finished. Right goo you know that erm acid thing you were doing this one be finishing that off. I dunno I can't remember. You marked it. and have you done a key Yes. Well a key should have a little bit at the bottom to say what what's it stands for. Oh you've done that red ones, yellow ones, where's your yellow ones Your key doesn't match your chart. You've put green ones and they're the metals . Your green ones are the alkali earth metals. You've got this all all wrong. Tell you what I'll get you another one. How are we doing ladies okay? Number five oh Can anybody tell er on number five why we got the upside down funnel. No. Now come on this is a check of who was listening Why have I why have we got that upside down funnel? Sh sh sh sh. Sh sh er no. What does the gas do to the water? Mark Mark Mark. It does but it might also do the gas might do something else as well. Turn the water green. How could it turn the water green what would it have to do in the water? Bubble. Come on we're going back to this shove it in water business again. Oh it dissolves. Dissolves stop it from sucking the liquid back again. dissolves to the stop the liquid from being sucked back into . The gas dissolves. the gas starts to come off when I just put the acid in. Yeah so you've got to heat it up . paper some P H erm Darren Darren sit down please. that funnel right now how did we control the speed at which the acid went in. With a tap. And then once all the acid was in if you left the tape open what would happen to the gas? It would just escape so we sh close the top and the gas has got to . Down the tube and into Yeah down the other tube and into the what's the thingumajiggy? What do you call it that tall cylinder thing? Thingumajiggy? You'll never guess it's for collecting gases so we call it a Gas . Gas jar. Not far off. Oh. Now come on. Speed it u yeah cos the black powder wasn't powerful enough. Can anybody tell me why the black powder's not powerful enough. Look at the shorthand for it M N O two it's not got so much? Oxygen. Very good it's not got so much oxygen. So you've got to give it some heat to help the oxygen to work. Now if anybody's finished and is wondering what to do check through and make sure everything is up to date. And then I've got some work here for those who thing everything's up to date. So don't start this work until everything else is up to date. It's on the end of this . And if anybody's been away and has got or has got missing sheets I've got spare sheets down here. Question sheets Don't forget your acid posters by the way. Or you getting another one. It's Right I would. The only problem is I haven't got many colours. You'd you'd do better to use your own colours if you've got . How are you doing okay Dean? Oh right well you need Oh not again. Right who can tell yes go on Michael. To let the acid in. To let not out to let what in slowly. The acid in slowly right. It lets the acid in slowly and once the acids in what does it stop next? Carbon dioxide So whatever's in there can't get out up there it's got to go through another pipe it's got to go through the other pipe. Two two reasons. To stop the gas from escaping and to let the acid in bit by bit. Sir? Yeah. Er you could put P H or universal or any antacid indicator. Sir Properties who can tell me a property of this gas. Look at it in through the in the fume cupboard I can see one from here. Green. It's green right good. It it's a bit misty alright fair enough that's a property. Anything else? If it can fall down out of that pipe into the jar it must be? Very good be heavy. If it erm sucks the water up if you're not careful it must. How can it suck the water up by? It hasn't actually done cos I put that funnel on the end to stop it from doing it. Yeah it would cause a vacuum as it dissolves. So it dissolves obviously. Have you got the smell one have you put the smell smell one down. Smells of? Swimming baths or bleach or You can put some universal indicator or erm P H paper or To stop it from sucking because it dissolves too well It's like you in there drinking drinking er coke out of a straw if you you suck enough It'll all end up in your mouth. If you just put a pipe straight in the end of the liquid it would suck the liquid up. Right Darren if you've finished the qu To s stop from sucking up Now who's finished? Number three you could on the filter paper I've out some of those P H test papers. You could put universal, P H, litmus anything. Oh yeah probably we don't stop just cos you're not . Are there any I've got the index out here if you want one. I'll thank 'em all very much then. Oh fine you want to thank them now. Can I thank you all very much for being cooperative. Come in. Good morning. Hello Doctor. Now stranger, what can we do for you this morning? a long time. A number of years. Aye, it's a long number of years. You've got spots . Mhm . I was told it was chicken pox, but I haven't Mhm. been to a doctor. Aye. I've had this for over a fortnight. Did it just come on all of a sudden? I think what happened it started on my legs, here. Right? Oh deary me . Now for a while, before I went to, I went to . That's turned into . Right. It's okay. we'll get that cleared for you. I thought it was Yeah. like that. No. Four or five days and it should all be starting to I hope it's not turning . A germ, there's a germ that floats about in the air and if it gets onto the skin when it's broken. It Was it? Was it originally . Well it looks as though it could well have been originally chicken pox? like chicken pox. Yeah. But that's all it takes, it's just the skin to get broken, and underneath the skin and it just spreads and it's And you haven't seen my arms. Same. Alright. Okay. My arms are really bad. Let's get that sorted for you. it was chicken pox and I'm saying to myself it's very infectious. What about , is that infectious? Yes. That's contagious as well. And the funny thing was I've Mm. only been off my work for about er seven days. I was at my work for a couple of days, Mhm. when this started. Yeah. So I must have passed it on . Aye. Impetigo isn't nearly as easy to pass on as chicken pox. In fact it's, it's really You have to be living in the same house as somebody who's I was ask asking myself . Aye. You, you've got to be using that same towels, you know, that sort of thing. Aha. You know, actually,mo all more or less direct contact Aha. before you can pick it up. Mhm. So there's no terrible worry in that way, that you've passed on to anybody. And that, I wouldn't worry about that. get that thing? Ah, you could get it anywhere, I mean even, see the likes of that, that wee cut in the back of my hand? Aha. Well it could start off in that. Just just . See I always wondered because er it seemed awfully slow in spreading it, it was there that's right. and a couple of days with nothing happening I'm saying, well, at least it's started clearing up, but then And then it moved somewhere else. it moved somewhere else and I'm saying I'm looking at it That's right. the only place I've not got it is my abdomen and my chest. Right down the front. It had nowhere to go. Aye. And it started on my back quite a bit, three of four days ago, well it's not just as bad but my arms are real bad. Right. Let's see if we can get you turned into a human being. Oh dear, and I'm saying to myself it was chicken pox Aye, but I don't think I've heard of that impetigo Doctor to be honest. Yeah. it's years and . It used to be quite a common thing. Yes. Correct. Aye, I remember. Ah, but it's y you still see it, I mean we still see it about once or twice every week. Mhm. But I mean it used to be every day Aye. we used to see it. So, it all cleared up okay? It won't Yes. Och aye. leave a lot of marks? No? Well, I suppose it . hopefully not. No. No. No. Now not nowadays, not with the, not with the stuff we get nowadays. Now. Now. Now. And what I've noticed is I've seen my bed linen. It's been weeping at night when I'm sleeping. That's right. That's right. In your sleep. That's right. most of this is drying up but the skull must get It seems to Right. weep. That's right. When the skin when we ju move around in the bed, the skin cracks open Oh that's it, it's all cracking here. Aye. Mhm. And the same with the crusty bits Oh aye. , when you move around at night it's the crust cracks open Mm. as well and you get this weepy, sticky Aha. yucky er yellowy green That's correct. Aye. coming out. That's right, isn't it? That's it. That's er here you are young William and that should get rid of that for you no bother at all. Right and er two things, you've got a special stuff for during the day and a different stuff for bedtime. Aha. I is it is it oral? Or what is it er? Tablets. Both of them's tablets? Both tablets. Both tablets to take. Aha. And that'll get rid of that for you. So I can get in ? What about work? An anything. I can go to work? Yeah. I feel a bit, I feel a bit embarrassed . Aye. The only thing about work is are you working with oil? I do work with oil, aye. Ah well, no chance. No chance cos that I'm working on Thursday so I'm Aye. but I work with turbines and it's Aye. No. It's for your own sake, because the o if the oil gets underneath the skin it can irritate your skin. Aha. So you're better er out the way of that for a week ? or so. Yeah. How are you keeping yourself, Doctor? Me? Fine. Oh, good. . Don't have much choice. I would say I've been pretty lucky recently myself . Oh, that's a good way to be. It's a good time to be a stranger in here. a bit guilty, you know? Right. See if we can keep it that way for another twenty years. Aha. Right. Thanks Doctor . Okay. Right. Much obliged. So, what will I gi things right now. give it another week? Give it a week,oh, within the week it should be a big lot better. So that'll be the following . Let's say a week on Monday. Back to work a week Aye. Monday. A week Monday. Great. . Aye. Thanks very much. Okay. Right, Bill. Right? Look after yourself Bye now. now. Bye. Thank you. Come in. Come in. Come in. mix up there. Aye. Well. She shouted, Mary , and two of us rose up. I said to the other one, are you Mary too? She said, aye . I said, which one ? Oh dear. . Well now. What can I do for you today? Oh it's just it's not getting any better. You're still having trouble? Aye. And er last time I came it was Doctor and he changed Yes. the tablets, and it's even worse now. And he put me off the Mhm. and I don't feel the same for off of that. I feel as if I have to use my spray more. I seemed right doing, alright drying my feet now and not my . You shouldn't have to use your spray more Mary because that's Mhm. Well I seem to be all tight Right. here. Right. Aha. I know how it is? My chest. Aye. I know how to do this. We'll Mhm. get you sorted out. Aha. Even just, usually I used to maybe just have it once. Sometimes I didn't even need it at all I could walk about shopping and everything. Aha. And this I've had to take it twice while I've been doing some shopping now. I feel as if my, it's funny it's not a pain but it's like my, I'm just going like that Aha. Right. Aha. And he put me off of that the other ones you gave me with the, what was it? Hexapol or something? Hexapol Aye. And you Yes. I, with, with this Monit Aye. that he gave you Aha. that would have fought with the Hexapol There would have, there would have been a reaction between Aye. the two Aha. so that you you're safer without that. Without that the ma without the Hexapol And you're better I've a taking the Monit Aye well the Hexapol with me. it wasn't doing me any good because it was It wasn't doing any good. still sore but it was still the same even with that. Even with that. Right. Mhm. Let's put you on this stuff and that'll get your circulation . At least they have spray now had a spray I don't know how long it is I've had it. And that's how I'd be You're I mean I never went through it much, but this last fortnight This is your . I've been using it all the time. get another one ? Yeah. No bother. No bother at all Mhm. that. It's usually in after you go I was never near the doctor myself . Well that's And this way he gets him a good life. If they hadn't had tha the accident to his Yes. it was on the er the femur? his femur that's Aha. right. And that's er bosses are after meeting and this is the one that's er That's going away. that's sore. That's going away. Well let's I feel that though I'd been dawdling it wouldn't have been so bad . let's cure you. Let's cure you. Ah. What do So stop, stop, stop, stop your Monit Stop the Monit Stop them altogether. Aha. And what about And s the Batol Mm? No. Don't touch the Batol No. Aha. These are pink tablets yo you start Mhm. taking them one in the morning and one at teatime and one at bedtime. Aha. That's three times a day. Three times a day. Three times a day. Aha. And, and come back up and see me in in three Aye. Aye. weeks and and they'll you know that er they've got ? No. You stop Wee, wee pink ones? stop that. Would Deborah need to then? I've been taking them all the time. No. You can stop them now. Stop the . Stop, stop the now. Mhm. Yes. Mhm. Stop that altogether. And I've got all these other pills I meant to bring them out and hand them in at the chemists Ah. First time you're passing. Aye. the chemists even? That'll do fine Mary. Aha. the aches the aches have been all I all got, I all got, no. I used the last of that er Minit or whatever you call it,Monit but I've got in the house and I've got Aha. Well first time, first time you're coming up to the supermarket, drop it, drop them in I just drop them in here ? Aye. Drop them in. Aha. No, no harm done. Because I say it's stupid you know to destroy them or fling them away Oh aye. or that. Oh aye. Eighteen pounds for a box is Aye. I know. Aha. expensive so throw I meant in fact to put them in my bag when I was coming here and I forgot. First time you're coming. First time you're coming up. No bother. Thank you. Thank you. But that should do the trick Mary And I and it'll settle it'll settle this as well. And will I come back again or will I? Three weeks. Three weeks? Do you work? You know back here to see how Aye. you're doing. Because it's alright doing my round the ankle and all? Yeah. Well we need to Sore. get skip ropes for you. I need to I need exercise. Right Mary. Right. Thank you. Okay. Cheerio now. Cheerio. Feeling blue? What do you do? One hundred women have an idea or two. Talking about depression is not something we do much, which is odd really because everybody gets depressed and vast numbers of us need help from time to time. Though because perhaps we feel guilty or embarrassed about the whole area of mental health we're not tackling the problems when they come up nearly as well we might. So we're going to try and start to change all that now. Let me ask the one hundred women here, have you ever been depressed? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And perhaps the only surprising thing about that result is that, is that seven people have said no! Ninety three have said yes. Let me ask you whether you would regard yourself a depressive person? Would you say are depressive rather than simply get depressed? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And there, only sixteen say they're depressive er people, eighty four no but the great majority here have been depressed from time to time. About what? I mean th a great variety of things are depressing but can you identify what makes you depressed? Lack of money. Sorry? Lack of money. Lack of money. And that's something, that must be a very Aha. common one? Aha. And then that your, your household is well, the sort of er, someone's lost their job, you know, you start what are we're gonna do? You know, how are we gonna manage? Mm. Etcetera. Who else? Ya? After a baby. Baby blues. Baby blues. Did you have baby blues? Yes. After my last one. Just after one? After the last one. What's it like? Absolutely terrible! Horrendous! What did you I , well I just didn't realize it was anything like that, I had I've had four children and the last one there was thirteen years difference between them and it was really, really terrible! He was about six months old and I didn't know what was wrong with me. How long did it last? About three months before I finally, I was husband made me go to the doctor or go to the doctors for me and that's when I realized it was depression I didn't know anything about it then. Really? Had you not been warned? Had you not No. read anything? No. Yes? Sometimes you don't need anything to make Mhm. you depressed. Mhm. Sometimes you've got a depressive illness. You know, a manic depressive or a schizophrenic or whatever. Yeah. Beside you. Living with somebody depressive has made me depressed on frequent occasions and th th the feelings of helplessness that you have in dealing with the person's depression. Yeah? Erm, one of the things that depresses me, is probably the main thing that depresses me is not being valued for what I am or what I do and I think many women suffer from depression because their strengths and their creativity are not recognised and valued. Mm. Anna? Being a single parent. Is that depressing? Yeah cos there's, on your own all the time and you feel you've got no time for yourself and that can be fairly bad at times. Yeah. Er, it's not just single parents, I think er, married couples as well cos I think Yep. society expects everybody to cope well and they don't. So I think that can become quite depressive as well. Up there. I think from what everyone's saying being a woman in Scotland today is that in itself er, a cause for depression. I think trying to exist in society at the moment is extremely difficult. And there's wi wide er, spread unemployment and there's the stress of being as that lady said, a single parent, erm, for women who work and have families they have their old conflict between what they're doing, doing at home and what they're doing at their work and who should have a priority. So I think erm, just a combination of trying to get through the week can be a sort of depression for many women. How do you cope with it, the ninety three of you who get depressed from time to time, whether it's severely or or or or not so severely? I think it's a matter of giving yourself time of accepting that maybe you're feeling low or I fe , when I'm feeling low I say right, I can't cope with things I've got to give myself some time where nothing's gonna bother me, if I can manage it, an hour, half an hour, just doing something for myself that I really like and that helps me once I accept myself as being depressed then it helps alleviate the stress involved with it. Is that something you think would work for everyone. I think it's worth a try. Doing something you like, if you can give yourself half an hour, or an hour, you know just say this is for me, and for me only. Mm mm. I think with erm, I I was brought up in a household where it was com , completely legitimate to admit to being depressed and that you would just have to cope, I think cope perhaps my most Mm. least favourite word in the entire language! Women coping all over the Mm. place with Mm. all sorts of terrible stresses and the only sort of legitimate reason for collapsing is to allow somebody else to cope beautifully with your collapse. I think with er, it's very interesting that people are actually admitting that they feel depressed and they have strategies for dealing with it. I'm sure it's re relatively recent. It probably is. It'll be useful Mm. to hear more of the strategies. Yes? I think it's important to get a listening ear and know that there are other people around who will give you support. You have to search that out. I'm not su , absolutely convinced, in terms of saying Mm. having an hour away from it is enough, I think there are a number of women who need to look and get support from somewhere. Is that hard to do would you say? Erm I think well I think it is, at times. I think in terms of people knowing, in terms of women knowing where they actually can get that support from. And also actually getting them there, themselves there in the first place is very difficult. Where's the yes? I think it helps if you can identify whether the the erm depression is just caused by erm the circumstances round about you which can be alleviated by changing them or if it's caused by eating habits or erm or erm hormones or chemical imbalances in, I've suffered, I think, from all them as well! Say like erm th stresses we're all under will cause depression, but after my had my children I suffered from reactive hyperglycaemia, low blood sugar, and we , that was glucose intolerance and I think an awful lot of women erm, suffer th from this and it's not erm found out and knowing the glucose intolerance I can understand how a lot of children erm, suffer from er problems with eating habits because I think this is being discovered more and more Mm mm. and I think society should be erm, trying to get to the root cause of like, chemical imbalances and eating problems rather than just putting people on tranquillizers. Well I wonder how many people here, I mean ninety three people say they ha , they th they occasionally do get depressed, I wonder if you ever have taken er, mood controlling drugs such as tranquillizers? Have you? Button one for yes, button two for no. It's erm it's regarded as er as an increasing problem er amongst women. Thirty nine have. Now we're talking about how you cope, the thirty nine who have do they work? Don't they work? Would you recommend it or wouldn't you? And obviously everybody has a different experience of this. Yes? Er, I actually had two stillborn babies, one one year after each other and they put me on Valium and it didn't do me any good at all! And my little boy was he was only about three at the time and I used to be used to angry at him and my neighbour used to come in and take him. And I was married to a soldier so I didn't have any family round about me at the time so it was it was pretty hard. And coming off valium was a lot harder because you don't realize that when you're on it you can't get back off it again. Did you, did you get help coming off it? Erm Well you were obviously, well you prescribed it in the first place Well that was supposed to be help. it was, it was actually there was a programme on television and my husband took me to the doctor and he said he felt I'd been on it too long, I'd been on it about six months and when I come off it, I come off it pretty quick and I ended up erm I didn't know what was wrong with me and it ended up I've now got epilepsy, and they didn't know if it was caused through erm I took a stroke about three four month after that and then I got the epilepsy as well, so they don't know if that me coming off it Mm mm. straight away, I just stopped it. Down there. Erm, I was erm, put on just for in ninety seventy three and your question that you're asked was and from nineteen seventy three till three years ago erm I know took my causes, I trust, put my trust in the doctors and erm over all those years I didn't realize that it was actually the tablets that was causing me the mental illness. And saying that, in the last three years I since discovered, and it was quite difficult to, which I did find, that there was alternative erm therapists, which was lots of groups that were going on and once I got into it erm the , it opened up a new, you know I ne I've never saw the light at the tunnel that is shining brightly now! Has anybody had the opposite experience with er with the kind of the drugs we're talking about, whereby they have been helpful and th , and they, and they would recommend them? Yeah? Er, I think anti-depressants can be helpful for a certain length of time but not for over a prolonged period of time. Erm and I think there's a big difference between them and tranquillizers and people tend to get the two mixed up. I think tranquillizers can be useful as well for a very short time limited period. Erm, but I certainly found anti-depressants helpful. Mm. Yes? Yes. I just wanted to say that speaking as a psychiatrist Mhm. valium is not an accepted treatment for depression and that we have excellent anti-depressant drugs, particularly ones that have come just in recent years that are very effective for depression, and I think bringing a great deal of benefit to depressed people. Well Ray say,i i I mean it's important that we yo you find out whether you are depressive, whether you have er ag , oh, something clinically wrong with you, whether you're just feeling a bit down. But perhaps we don't really know enough and we don't know where to go for information, I mean I don't know er I, I I'm not an expert but there are experts here, how would you assess the services available to people who feel they do need help, or for people who perhaps don't know they need help? Yes? Yes I think the situation in Scotland is very poor! I'm, I'm an alternative medicine practitioner and I tend to get a lot of people who are depressed coming to see me, people who have been through the normal routes Mhm. gone to their GP's, and often have been given some sort of medicine for their depression but haven't had the counselling side of things dealt with and they've just been given re-prescriptions, not necessarily seen every time for a re-prescription. Behind you. I think there are a number of counselling services available, but I also think it's very difficult sometimes for women to get there Mhm. and it's it's something about the shame around depression that we don't actually come forward for counselling and there's certainly not enough free counselling services in Scotland. There. I'm also an alternative therapist and I do find that this is one of the major problems, that ninety percent of my patients who come to me suffer from stress and depression, and really what has happened in a lot of cases is that they have been put on valium and drugs, they find the side effects are horrific! And actually really in a last resort in many cases they come to you. Mm. Mm. I went through a period of depression erm I'd been attending the doctor I'd been told that I was suffering from various illnesses, but nothing helped. I was given anti- depressants, that didn't help and it wasn't until four years later when they actually admitted me to hospital and then an ulcer and the depression disappeared once it had been diagnosed. But all the time I'd been attending the doctor I'd been told, first of all it was gall stones Mm. then it was something else Mm. then it was something else and I honestly thought the doctor thought I was cracked! There's nothing the matter with me! And I was taken into hospital and it was an ulcer and the depression disappeared after that. Mm. There. I think speaking as another psychiatrist er the medical profession do have to look very carefully and perhaps how a lot of the damage has been done er with how women perceive whether they can ask for help or not because a lot of the women here have raised been giving tranquillizers and my colleague across there has pointed out that tranquillizers are not an appropriate way of treating depression. Mhm. And diagnosis is very, very important that, if you have a medical, clinical state of depression try and pull yourself out of it, by your, your own efforts and doing alternative things is not necessarily going to be effective. And diagnosis is very important, as a psychiatrist again, training our medical students, we are trying to do a lot of education along that line because perhaps some of the older GP's, along the way, have not recognised the importance of this. Well I, I went to a psychiatrist once looking for a self-help group cos I didn't want tablets or anything I just wanted somebody I could talk to. Mhm. But what I found when I went was I had to go through the psychiatrist to find this group cos it wasn't available. My doctor didn't know anything about it. So having gone there I got counselling which I found was very useful to me. More useful than all the medications and so forth like them. So once you found it Aha. it was helpful? Yes? Up there. Yes. Now, when I took post-natal depression I asked my health visitor, you know, where do you go? And she sent me to a mother and toddler group, I mean, she didn't tell me about any self-help groups, it's mother and toddler, she just said take you and the baby and go to mother and toddler and that'll be it. And that's all the help I got from my G P. Beside you. I found that erm, we run par , a self-help group as well for ladies with post-natal depression Mhm. and I found, for me personally and a lot of other mothers that it started in pregnancy. Now, I don't know if anybody's had the experience but they're only interested in your unborn child, they're not interested in how you feel at that time. I mean, you think you give birth and you're forgotten, I mean your health visitor visits your baby, and then you've got the baby blues, and we we are trying to do something to get them to help and warn people about when they are pregnant it can happen because it does start then, not after you've had the baby, it builds up and them wham, it hits you! Yes? I think mental illness isn't taken seriously enough. I think that er, there's a problem, first of all you've identified that women experience er, depression and I think that's not taken very seriously by policy makers and people in power,na namely men. I think women get depressed but men suffer from stress which is somehow more respectable it's more macho, it's associated with work and Aha. you know, there are all sorts of means of dealing with stress Mhm. which are not always open to women. But it's more pu , you know, it's almost de rigueur,mo amongst certain types of executive to be suffering from stress. And I suspect it's the same kind of actual physical complaint that women who complained of being depressed have. Yes? Women have a lot different stress than men. Men Mm. go out nine to five to work, they are stressed nine till five, women, especially women with children have it twenty Mhm. four hours a day, they don't have a nine to five job, they're on call twenty four hours a day and that's a lot more stressful. Mhm. I think that men tend to rely more on a crutch such as alcohol I don't if it relieves Mm mm. the problem more but it tends to be men that cope in that way and women aren't seen to cope as well, maybe they just don't use things like alcohol Mhm. as much as the men. Well I'm vo involved in Crossline which is a a Christian run telephone helpline, erm, we off , also offer free counselling and they find that er, there's more men will actually pick up the telephone, cos they're not seen erm, whereas more women will actually come in for face to face counselling. I think it's a stigma that a lot of men feel they can't show that they're depressed or they've got a problem so they'll pick up a ph , a phone. Yes? Well as the speaker before last mentioned, men are in fact diagnosed twice as often as women are suffering from alcoholism. I think men tend to act out their depression more than women. Yes? I'd just like to raise a point that erm most men are psychiat , er mo most of the psychiatrists are men and that a lot of the diagnosis I feel, come from a very sort of patriarchal view erm, you know a lot of have sort of brought up the alternative sort of er medicine and er self-help groups, and to me, having been through psychiatry which is a, a huge machine that is very difficult to get out that er to me, that's the only future and there's millions of pounds going into psychiatry and we're reviewing it now with community care plans which, I I don't think anybody is actually clear about but er, you know, the the millions that are put into psychiatry, I'd like to see more sort of counselling er, become available or, more money given to sort of er mental health associations. Mhm. Following, from what was said there we know that there's, that there's a limited pot for mental health because that's the way it's going to be, we've been told that so there's a real big job for women Mhm. to look at er, a P R job about changing the way those resources are used so that they're used in the way that's been talked away, er, talked about tonight which is way that clearly many wo , many women want to see them being used. And women have to got to get, get out there and ensure that the people who do plan the way that these services are are operated and managed an an all the things evaluated, that women have a real say in that. Which women? The women who are the professionals in the field or being No. The women who will use the services, women who have used the services in the past, and women who will use them in the future, and that's all of us. Now, say more about that practically, because I mean if you're depressed, you may feel too depressed to go to a a professional, you may have great difficulty getting there for whatever reason because you're ashamed as someone mentioned, you're embarrassed, you don't want to admit you can't cope, which is a syndrome once you get there how do you pluck up the courage to say well actually what your offering me isn't good enough, I've heard on on television there is something better and I want it? Gosh! There'll be other people here who I'm sure who have done it. But, it's up to organisations like the ones we work for to respond to that and to not be doing the planning on behalf of other people. Yes? I think we're still talking here about depression and how to go and Mm. find a cure erm perhaps we should try and think about why we get depressed in the first place, I know there's lot of people who co , here have had problems. I think it's important to find space for ourselves which sometimes we just don't do. You know, find things to do to occupy ourselves in other ways. You mean cope? Mm. Well, no not cope but to to enable us to cope we have find space for ourselves, do something, purely for ourselves rather than always be thinking about our children, thinking about the home thinking about the family, we're as important and I think that's what people must realize to begin with. Yes? I suffer more from a feeling of guilt, perhaps than men do. I think it's part of a vicious circle, that sometimes it's guilt which leads to depression and then women feel guilty about being depressed and that's why they take what is on offer to them. I think there's a great cult of perfection amongst women, that they're trying to be all Aha. things to all people all the time. Research has shown recently that erm a life event, such as you described can precipitate depression in someone who's self esteem is low and I think this is where we women are more vulnerable. Although we've advanced a great deal in the last fifty years, we still have a way to go and our self esteem is lower than men. I want to turn this right round because a couple of people have mentioned guilt and er I I suspect that one of the reasons that women are a bit worried about talking about depression or or campaigning for changes in policy, or more funding, or or whatever, is that for a long time women have been thought of as the weaker sex, more emotional, more nervous, by a, a a male establishment, I'm talking about past centuries, isn't there a case for saying there's actually we have a right to be depressed, I mean, obviously it's normal, ninety three of you get depressed from time to time, the majority of you don't think you clinically depressive if it is, if it's normal to be depressed shouldn't the services to cope with depression, if we need outside help, be there and there's no shame in it? I mean, you've got the right to go to the dentist, the right to go to the doctor! Yes? I think what would be helpful for all of us is to think of our er mental health rather than mental illness Mhm. and er, you know it's part of a spectrum, and if we're all as aware of er mental health as we are with physical health now, and if that was, was carried out in public education campaigns and in schools, I think you're right, we would have this right to mental illness as part of a overall mental health. Ray? Erm, it is part of the e education curriculum and design, the development of inter-personal, pschyo-motor and cognition skills apparently so if the experts e actually gave me galloping schizophrenia because on one hand I thought hallelujah and in the other hand will we make as mak , bigger mess of this as they did in multi=sensory teaching methods in a coordinative approach to learning? What are the experts view on this? How are they going to manage to implement this without making the situation any worse! You'll blind us with science if we go into that right now! Yes? Erm, I think one of the important bits is th , the issue of why is is part of it, why people get depressed? And I think it's, a great deal of it is to do with failed expectations. Whose? And people get depressed, like when they're dealing with bereavement, that's an event in a person's life and causes short term dis , short term, very intense distress, but that's different from the way we're constructed through the media and all sorts of ways to be super mothers, super wives, super kiddie and a super this that and the next thing which none of use can meet all these demands at one go! But because, the media hold out these expectations as the norm and people can't meet them all, they then feel failures Aha. and that is also why, going back to a point earlier on, why I think erm counselling and alternative medicine, and so on, is marginalized it would be such a rock to the social order to actually acknowledge that people are in distress because it's the social order that's causing that distress. It's the media again! But it's tru And the patriarchal society. But I just wanted to bring up some of the underlying reasons for depression, and one of the large things that society is having to address just now is child sexual abuse Mhm. which er er in my profession as well I come up against all the time and I I think that we're not really acknowledging that that is very often a cause, for men and women Mhm. er of future mental health problems. Beside you. Yes. I I wonder really, the only rational appro , response to the world at the moment isn't to be depressed, I mean, everyone looks around famines in Africa, and war and jus and depredation Mm Mhm. all around us Mhm. as well as more domestic problems within Scotland of unemployment and so on, I mean, really depression should be regarded as a normal response Mm. and what women are experiencing half the time is perfectly rational. Yes. I don't actually believe that that depression is normal, I believe that we can overcome depression, and I think there is some creative things that we can do out of a depression people can become stronger, they can tap into their resources inside with support and help, so I can believe it's a positive experience. Mhm. I think that it's important to recognize that to have a depressed mood is not to have a depressed illness Mhm. we all can get depressed if we're talking about a mood state, that's not an illness. Depression, as an illness is not normal any more than having
