- Well, I don't know, dear. - Mr. Drysdale. - What do you want, Tyler? - Miss Hathaway called. She said something had come up and to go ahead and start the wedding without her. - Well, what could have come up? - I wish I knew. My, what a lovely dog. Oh, thank you. Tyler, make yourself useful. Go count the olives. Oh, yeah. Right away. Oh, I hate that little worm. What could possibly be more important than this to Miss Hathaway? - Look at that. New nurse. - Yeah. - Howdy, Mama! - My baby! Oh! Why! My goodness, Beverly Hills has made you so sophisticated. Doesn't your twin brother look handsome? - Hi, jethro. - Give him a kiss, Jethrine. Howdy, Jethro. Oh, excuse me. - I reckon. - Yep. Young man... I am here to see Daisy Mae Moses. Ah, then you must be here for the rabies test. Yes. Rabies test. Exactly right. Then you want Room 525. Oh, nurse. Better be careful. She's a wild one. We had to give her electroshock therapy. Thank you. - Excuse me. - No problem. My God. Oh, Granny. Your elixir. I will take you out of here immediately. Your hair is just a bit disheveled. Miss Jane? Is that you? - 'Tis I. - Oh! - Granny says she don't trust Miss Laurette. - Oh. Take off that silly hat. I heard she's so skinny, you couldn't hit her with a handful of corn. Look where they're parking the cars. My God, how tacky. This place is turning into a zoo. I think she's tryin' to take him for all he's got. Hmm. Hi there, handsome. - You mind if I sit in this chair? - This chair? - I was kind of saving... - Thank you. Lovely wedding, isn't it? Go. Oh. We've got to get back. I called. I told them to stop the wedding... but that Tyler is so incompetent. Tyler? Him and Laurette's the ones that stuck me in this hellhole! So, stabbed in the back by one of our own. And she ain't no foreigner. There they are. Stop them. Jethro, hold up. - Come on. Come on. - Oh, there she is. - Come on. Come on. Come on. - Oh, she looks beautiful. Oh, I've got the vapors. My makeup. Oh. "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in case of an emergency. "Oxygen masks will fall from the overhead compartment. "Your seat cushion can be used as a floating'device. - Thus sayeth the Lord. " - Excuse me, Reverend. But I believe you're readin' the airplane safety instructions. May we skip this part? Hathaway had better have a good excuse for not being here. Quick, Granny, hurry.! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Can I see your invitations, please? I'll handle this, Granny. Young man, have you any idea with whom you're speaking? I'd say one crazy lady and another one with a bad wig. Every strand of this here hair is mine! - Ow! - Oh... Oh, Granny, no, no, no! No, Granny, no! No, Granny, no! We'll find another way. "We are gathered here to unite these two in holy matrimony. " - Can we hurry things up, please? - Yes, ma'am. Come on. Come on, baby. "If any one of y'all has one good reason these two shouldn't be hitched... " and it darn tootin' better be a good reason... "then speak now or forever hold your peace. " - All right, then. "I now pronounce you... " - Please. Please. Please. "man and... " What in tarnation is that? Charge! Come on, Granny! It is I, Jane Hathaway. Hathaway, have you lost your mind? She's an impostor. She's marrying Mr. Clampett just to steal his money. - That sidewinder Tyler helped her! - I'm ruined! Milburn! Milburn! Tyler. Let's set up the computer and push the button. If I can't have their money, nobody should. Quick! Okay. We'll send their billion bucks bouncing'around so many banks... - they'll never find it. - It's all set. All we got to do is push that button. You rustic, nose-picking, inbred yokels! - You're all about to be poor again. - Think again. No, you don't, you scheming'skunk.! Wait'll I get my hands on you! Oh, Pa, you must be so disappointed. A little. But, Elly May, I was mainly marrying' Miss Laurette... 'cause I thought you wanted her for your new ma. - I'm so sorry, Pa. - Don't be sorry. I love you just the way you are. I reckon I oughta raise you up to be who you want to be. Well, I don't need a new ma, not as long as I got you and Granny. Hot dog, Miss Jane! You sure are a good shot. Well, thank you, Jethro. - Whoo! - Got ya! Well, folks, I guess you can say... things didn't turn out quite the way we planned. So, since there ain't gonna be no hitching'... and we're all here anyway... I say we have one hellacious shindig. Yeah.! - Let go of me.! - Here, boys. She's all yours! Let go of my hand! - Hey! Nobody treats my pa that way! - Shut up! How's that for ladylike, you old money-grubber? Come on, city boy, let's dance. All right, stand back! You're under arrest for kidnapping... attempted embezzlement and fraud. Oh, right.! It was all Tyler's idea. I admit it freely. It was all her idea. I always fall in love with the wrong kind of man. - Clean up that cake. - Don't step on the train. I'll wait for you, honey. Well, where was she? She... Oh.! - Oh, well... - Whee doggie! Whoo.! Yeah.! That's good. Thank you. That's just about right. Oops! It's a shame they had to file for bankruptcy. I just hope my call to the I.R.S. didn't have... - Oh, I shouldn't open it. Sorry. - No problem. We'll do it again. But I got there... That old lady is, uh... That old lady is... I'm sorry. - That's okay. - She's gettin' pretty old by now, I'll tell ya. Still rolling. - Okay. Give me a big smile. - I can't get any bigger. So, uh, what happened? Actually, he slapped me. Why don't you come up here? Let me take a good look at you. Jim. Jim? They're gettin'worried about you. - Not even a bridesmaid. - I gotta do this again. Action.! We've got... No, we've got to get back. I called, I told them to postpone the... - I lost my purse. - It's right here. - How did you get it? - I don't know. Jethro? Come on down here. Likely as not, there's another family lives up here... there. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for magic. Good evening, Gotham. I'm Zatanna. Tonight, I can promise you a few surprises. A thrill or two along the way. And with luck, a happy ending. How long has it been, 10 years, 12? All that and another lifetime. She and her father were fond of you. I was a different person then. Yes. Intense, driven, moody. She'd never recognize you now. Now open your heart to magic, and become a child again. Remember, concentration and control. Focus on them, and you can master any escape. Go. Congratulations. You've beaten your old time by six seconds. Yes. You've got the makings of a great magician. I'm sorry you're going to be moving on. Same here. It was an honor to study with you, Zatara. But to what end? Three months ago you appeared on my doorstep with no interest in performing. And yet dying to become an escape artist. And for some reason, I wound up teaching you secrets I'd never shown another magician. You could've sent me away. No. There was something inside you I had no right to deny. Something deep and painful. After all, I would be foolish to assume I was the only one with secrets. Eh, John Smith? Thanks for everything, sir. I'll miss you, John. And so, I trust, will Zatanna. Hi, Daddy. Good night, children. I thought you'd be finishing the tour with us. I'm leaving for Japan tomorrow. There's still a lot I have to learn. Boy, that's you. One big serious schoolboy. No time in your life for fun or magic. Here, pick a card. I'll tell your future. I see emotion, intensity two of hearts. Joker. Oh, it's a dumb trick anyway. Look, I don't know the future, but I know I'll see you again someday, Zanna. You're the only one who ever calls me Zanna. I really hate it. No goodbye hug? See. It's not so bad. - I'll write you. - No, you won't. - I promise. - You can't. I locked your hands to the wall. What? Looks like someone's missing their plane tomorrow. If you were any kind of escape artist you'd be out of those cuffs and through the door by now. Now you see him, now you don't. Thank you. You know I have this little problem with money. Seems like it disappears before I even make it. And here to help demonstrate are Mr. Irving Fauncewater director of the Gotham Mint, and noted magic debunker Dr. Montague Kane. Welcome, gentlemen. Miss Zatanna. This is so exciting. Let me guess, first time on stage, Irv? Nothing like enthusiasm, right, folks? The way they're responding, one would think your ridiculous stunt's going to work. Just to clue you in, Monty here makes a living exposing magicians' secrets. Simple tricks and nonsense. And I've invited him here to find the secret of the feat I'm attempting tonight. There is no secret. What you're proposing is flat-out impossible. Well, kids, impossible is what I'm all about. Mr. Fauncewater, open the doors, please. Ten million dollars and the means to make it. Take a good look, because you know what they say about money: Easy come easy go! Oh, my. Bravo, my dear. It was a pleasure to be proven wrong. Thank you, Monty. And now, just so Irv doesn't have a fit, I'll bring it back good as new. The money. Where's the money? "Where's the money," he says. It's right there, isn't it? It's gone. What have you done with it? Now take it easy, Irv. I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation. I'm sure the audience would like to hear it. - As would the police. - Now, wait a minute. Police, police! The police are coming. It's a trick, an illusion. I don't know what went wrong but if we can all just calm down for a second... You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you... This never happens to me in Vegas. She's been set up. Obviously, but as she's the only suspect, the police must hold her. Giving the real thief time to escape. I can't let that happen. And more important, you can't desert an old friend. - Nice car. - Thanks. I didn't love the idea of spending the night in jail but this makes me a fugitive. I believe I'm looking at prison time now. I heard about the mint robbery. I can prove you didn't do it. Why do you care about some leggy dame in nylons? Or have I answered my own question? If you want to go it alone... No, no. I'm sorry. I'm having a bad day. I'm sure whoever framed you knew how your trick was done. They may have left a clue at the mint. - This place is surrounded by cops. - Just relax. That's where the money was. Look. This line was recently scraped into the floor. Whatever made it left shards of glass too. That would have been one mighty big piece of glass. Or mirror. Like the one you used to reflect the hologram of the vanished mint. Oh, sure, take all the mystery out of life. I think the money was stolen before you got here. The thief reflected a hologram of the cash while you did your trick. Then quickly hid the mirror when it was over. How'd he get rid of a mirror that big? He didn't. It's still here. Who's in here? Hold it. Stay where you are. Only another magician could have rigged that trick. Or someone who knows their methods. Like Montague Kane. He's been ripping off illusionists for years. I thought I finally had a trick even he couldn't expose. Wrong. I'll settle with Kane. Meantime, I'd better drop you someplace safe. Oh, no. Kane played me for a sap, and I'll see him go down for it. All right, but it could be dangerous. Sure there's no one you want to call first? Friends, family, a husband, maybe? Me? Who's got time for a relationship when you pull rabbits out of a hat 52 weeks a year? Besides, someone's got to keep the old act going now that dad's gone. - I'm sorry. - Why? I saw him perform when I was younger. He was great. Thanks. You know I have the weirdest feeling we've met before. I just have that kind of face. It would seem I have guests. Come in, and join me by the fire. Come, come. Don't be shy. You've obviously unraveled my little scheme and I would congratulate you face to face. You're not going to have a face when I'm done with you. You slimy... It's a trap. A trifle clichéd, I know, but effective nonetheless. And while you briefly savor your fleeting triumph I am winging toward more comfortable surroundings. Adieu. - I have an idea. - Oh, I would hope so. This way. I always did know how to make an exit. Unfortunately, so did Kane. And while you briefly savor your fleeting triumph I am winging toward more comfortable surroundings. Adieu. Come on. The show's not over yet. Take a last longing look, gentlemen. We're heading to a place where the climate's warmer, the people friendlier and the extradition laws are nonexistent. The only place you're heading is a prison cell. Well done, Batman. You not only eluded my trap, but solved my clue as well. Get rid of him. Oh, Monty. You fell for the second-oldest trick in the book. And here's the first. Keep your distance, detective. You are most engaging, my dear. Beautiful, impetuous. I could be persuaded to spare you, if properly implored. Bring them both! With all reverence for the departed, Zatara himself couldn't escape those locks. Still, between the two of you, you might be able to loosen a few chains before you hit the water. Take my hand. Scared? That makes two of us. - Trust me, Zanna. - Zanna? Quick, in my glove. Farewell, my dear Zatanna. We could have been magic. Incredible. Stop firing, you fools! Get rid of him. Don't you know? A magician never does the same trick twice. So you never wrote. I meant to. Really. Hey, it's okay. I can see you've been busy. - Just answer an old friend one question. - Shoot. What happened that made you put this on? A painful memory. And a promise. I'd say you're keeping that promise pretty well. And for what it's worth, Dad would have been proud of you tonight. You too. Can I give you a ride? Three features make WayneTech's new Raven X-111 stealth helicopter unique among military aircraft. The first is her silent-running capability making the Raven ideal for reconnaissance and covert operations. Another is her state-of-the-art cloaking device. This renders her invisible to all normal forms of radar and sonar detection. Last, but certainly not least there is her extraordinary ZVF sensor system. ZVF, as I'm sure you've heard, stands for "zero visibility flight." With this new technology, feedback from the aircraft's radar and sonar is translated not into blips on a tracking grid but rather into computer-generated images on a video-display terminal. But should you think the Raven X-111 has only defensive capabilities think again. Looks like it's going better than we hoped. Wouldn't you say, Mr. Wayne? I guess, though I still have serious misgivings about building weapons systems. Look out! What are they trying to do? Hey, what's that? - Looks like the helicopter crew. - But if you guys are here then who's flying the chopper? Look at them. Taking off like scared pigeons. You find pigeons funny, my friend? No, boss. Not me. Good. You'll do well to remember that. Attention. Attention. This is the Penguin speaking. I have taken control of your precious Raven and intend to be paid handsomely for its return. I will contact the mayor's office with the instructions for delivery of the ransom. As of this moment the most dangerous bird in the sky is the Penguin. Master Bruce. Home, Alfred. Now. But, sir, you need medical attention. No. I don't want the WayneTech doctors examining me. Call Leslie. Have her meet us at the house. Begging your pardon, sir, but why so secretive? Because I don't want anyone to find out that I can't see. It's too soon to know for sure, Bruce, but it looks like it's only temporary. It might last two, maybe three days at the most. Assuming, of course, you actually follow my instructions for a change. - What happened? - It looks like the explosion flash burned both retinas. It'll heal better if you keep your eyes completely covered for at least 36 hours. Otherwise, you could damage your vision permanently. So keep him home, Alfred, even if you have to hog-tie him. He needs to rest, which means the Batman is off duty too. No way, Leslie. Not as long as the Penguin has that chopper. If there is some question, Master Bruce, I urge you to resolve it straightaway. You've a call on your private line. - Then let's go. - In your condition, sir? If you think a little inconvenience like this is gonna stop me... Indeed. He didn't respond? No, Mr. Mayor. But I'm sure there's a reason. Who cares. What's Mr. Trick-or-Treat gonna do that we can't? I got 12 details crawling over every airfield and heliport in four counties. Quite a machine, this Raven. Amazing what its communications equipment can do, don't you agree? - You received my instructions? - They arrived by messenger this morning. You know, 100 million is a lot of money. It'll take time to raise that much. You're stalling, Hill. Obviously you're not taking me seriously. I warned you not to make that mistake. Apparently I'll have to show you why. You should've seen his face when I told him. Yeah. What the heck is that? I don't know. It's not making a sound. Jam it, get us out of here! - You sure this is a good idea, boss? - Do as you're told. - as a warning of what he'll do tomorrow. Amazingly, all those on the collapsing bridge escaped with only minor injuries. Alfred, I've got to find some way to stop him. Sight or no sight. I still think this is a terrible idea. I mean, using electrodes to connect this gizmo directly to your brain's optic center? Objection noted. May I have the headpiece, please? Those ZVF components I gave you, you wired them into this thing? I know how to follow instructions. Just be careful with that power pack. You have to keep recharging it. Will it work, sir? Only one way to find out. Well done, sir. I was aiming for its head. It isn't perfect but it will have to do. I can only pray that the same technology that created this crisis can help me put an end to it. Just what I was afraid of. According to the controller, we can't come close to putting that ransom together. Not without shutting down basic municipal services. So, what other options we got? None, gentlemen. Which is why you're going to do exactly what the Penguin wants you to. We interrupt our regular programming for this special report. This is Mayor Hamilton Hill with a personal message for the Penguin wherever you may be tonight. You've won. Just bring the Raven X- 111 to the drop site at midnight and I promise you'll get everything that's coming to you. You see? I told you they'd knuckle under. - But, boss, it sounds too easy. - Relax. With the Raven's instruments, we'll be able to spot a trap a mile away, literally. And if, in fact, this is a double-cross may heaven help them all. Scanners show the area is secure, boss. In that case, gentlemen, it's payday. What? What? ! Gotcha. But...? But how could he sneak up on us like that? That plane of his must have a cloaking device too. This means war! - Mayday! - Mayday! The laser cannons. Use the lasers! Red alert. Red alert. Traumatic impact. Heat damage to fuselage. Breach to hull. Extensive structural damage. Tell me something I don't know. Sixty-five seconds to total system failure. Look. The Bat's going down. Warning. Warning. Electrical system failure. Switching to auxiliary power. Happy landing, rodent! Look. There! Terrific. Oh, no, my pointy-eared old friend. You don't escape me that easily. Look at the way he's moving. There's something wrong with him. Why, yes. I think he's injured. I'll handle him. What's the matter, Bat...? Your aim appears to be a little off today, Batman. I don't think you can hit the broad side of a barn let alone the broad side of this bird. You're blind as a bat. Sightless and helpless. You got one right. And where do you think you're going? You've hit a dead end, rodent. You're only prolonging the inevitable. Not possible. You're supposed to be helpless. Helpless! I'd feel a lot better about this if you'd listened to me. Master Bruce? Well? My word, sir. Surely you're not... No, Alfred. I can see just fine. And right now, I've never seen anything prettier.

The Bible is the most important book in Western Culture It describes the reason of being for humanity, and the world we live in It's characters span the range of the literary imagination And it's laws have spanned empires To understand art as an expression of the Western world, we will start here {Seven Deadly Sins} The Roman Catholic Church lists Seven Deadly Sins Which condemn a soul to hell Lust and Gluttony are the lowest two. And we was move towards the worst, we move upward on the human body, from the physical, to the immaterial {lust, gluttony, laziness, greed, anger, envy, pride} The deadliest transgression is pride Pride, is the sin of Lucifer, the angel called Dragon, who lead a war against God In Cyberpunk film, we see this character moving upwards, towards a confrontation with great power What they ascend we call the {Great Chain of Being} Forged in the hierarchy of the Roman State The "Great Chain of Being" is a business model of the Western universe Atop it, sits god, below him, angels {holy-pastoral :top} {unholy-demonic: bottom} at the middle of the chain, Mankind {holy-pastoral :top} {unholy-demonic: bottom} Below, the world of animals and nature {holy-pastoral :top} {unholy-demonic: bottom} and finally, the world of Hell {holy-pastoral :top} {unholy-demonic: bottom} Yaweh, God, made a garden called Eden and he put a woman, where he had formed and they were both naked and not ashamed.

For Yaweh God sent him from the Garden of Eden, to till the ground, from which he was taken The story of Adam and Eve represents "tragic action" {tragic action} Downward movement on the "Great Chain of Being" Movement into the Demonic World, where man is unhappy and imprisoned Adam and Eve's fall from grace, is just one of these stories from the bible The Israelites fall into the world of slavery Daniel falls into the animal world of the Lion's Den and Jesus falls from the Crucifix, into death The redeemer of this downward movement on the "Great Chain of Being" is best exampled by Jesus, , a romantic hero.

The Greek understanding of Tragedy stipulates that it is an inevitable componet of human life This often-stoic culture recognized tragedy as interwoven with the fabric of duty and justice but it puts no special blame on the tragic victim The bible does Tragedy is the result of sin Heaven holds the scales of life, and decides who must suffer Sodom burns for the sins of it's inhabitants The tower of Babel falls, for the pride of it's builders Man enters hell for breaking God's law If you are not careful to follow all of Yaweh's laws, then the following curses will befall you Though you will get engaged to marry a woman, another man will rape her Yaweh will take delight in ruining and destroying you He will affect you with hemmorieds, scurvy, itch ulcers, boils, tumors, madness, blindness, confusion, drought, mildew, and wild animals will attack you, and your dead body The Holy Bible (please consult your doctor, before breaking God's law) When we discuss tragedy in Cyberpunk film a little later, it will be important to keep in mind the conflict of these two tragic modes There are two images of the world in Western culture: The Pastoral and the Demonic On the great chain of being, they describe the proximity of the subject in question, to God The 'Pastoral World' is holy and describes an existence blessed by God The Demonic describes an existence condemmed by ultimate power In this painting, we see the pastoral and demonic worlds in opposition On the right, inhuman, shadowed soldiers fire into an unarmed crowd which is lit in darkness by God's holy light The hero has his arms outstretched, as the figure of Christ This is what Western culture does: diving the universe into two parts Black and White, Pastoral and Demonic, Hero and Villian To understand Cyberpunk film, we must understand the pastoral and demonic representation of man's experience in nature, technology, and society {garden land} {blue planet, act 1} {Pastoral World of Nature} The 'Pastoral World of Nature' is the world of Eden, and of creatures blessed by God a world abounding in magic, fertility, and life {Demonic World of Nature} The 'Demonic World of Nature' is the world of the hunter, and the hunted Man is only flesh, trying to survive an inhospitable environment A Wasteland Man is swept through existence by a world that does not care whether he lives or dies In the darkness of nature are the symbols of Satan: The Monster, the Leviathan, the Dragon {Pastoral World of Technology} The 'Pastoral World of Technology' is a world, where in a city of light, man and machine are friends I am president, Robot President Dear Robots all over the world, we have suffered for a long time as slaves of man But Man cannot live without Robots We want to build a world where Robots and Man can live together, sharing our suffering, and our happiness {Demonic World of Technology} The 'Demonic World of Technology' is the city at night, towers built upon a foundation of pride and sin {prison... labyrinth} It is the world of the prison, and the labyrinth {tower of evil} In the center of the metropolis, is the tower of babylon, the home of the demonic king (sign: "Atomic Cafe") {Pastoral World of Society} We'd like you to come to the temple with us later, that is, if you're not too worn out, from your recital Yes, Papa If only your words were true -I hate to kill you -You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die -begin -time to get ready for your nap -don't you just love them to pieces? One day, while preaching, he was smitten by love {loving family} The 'Pastoral World of Society' is the world of the supportive and loving family A world of easy social relations, and individual innocence {Demonic World of Society} The 'Demonic World of Society' is a world of slavery, poverty, and war It is a world where authority is mad, and the persecuted sane -It is the finding of this court of inquiry, that warrant officer, E. Ripley -You don't know what you're doing -Get some restraints in here now! -You don't know what you're doing! {chaos, illegal sexuality} Biblical law is replaced by social chaos and illegal sexuality A reminder: It is every man for himself {combat for entertainment} In place of noble duels, we have combat for entertainment Cyberpunk Film portrays nature, technology, and society, as all existing in the demonic world It is a portrait of humanity trapped within darkness :30 Intermission (stretch) {...} We can see four primary plot lines, or mythos, in the Western imagination {holy (pastoral)} {unholy (demonic)} {Comedy - Spring} Comedy, is the myth of Spring {Comedy - Spring} After a brief detour in a darker world, it emerges as a portrait of a happy and fertile humanity {Romance - Summer} Romance is the myth of summer {Romance - Summer} The hero moves into the darkness on a quest, in which he prevails {Romance - Summer} Returning his society to the pastoral {Tragedy - Fall} Tragedy, like Romance, begins in a pastoral setting, but the hero becomes trapped in the demonic {Tragedy - Fall} He is unable to return is society to a state of grace {Irony - Winter} The lowest point on the Great Chain of Being is Irony, which chiefly, is a parody of the romantic mythos {Irony - Winter} Irony takes place in a dark, lonely setting {Irony - Winter} Irony does move at one point to the top of the Great Chain of Being {Irony - Winter} But it does so only that it may reveal the holy world as an illusion, and return to an even darker place Four seasons of the year Four images of life on Earth Four plots, describing the relationship of those images {Comedy: the myth of spring} Comedy is the myth of Spring It involves young lovers blocked by unfair rules or laws, and a cast of interesting friends, who wish to help them copulate Eventually, it is discovered that the hero has a previously unknown status, such as a 'king in waiting' and the lovers are allowed to marry In this 'Cheers' episode, the blocking action of an old law is modesty Which prevents Diana from entering the 'Bostons Best Barmaid' contest She gets over it. But since this is a sitcom, she is not allowed to unite with her potential lover, until possibly, next week {...} Although comedy does bring about resolution of a conflict, the threat presented the pastoral world is often too dark, for the levity of a comedy to be maintained by it's characters acceptably -That's why we've called this special meeting of the world's greatest powers -We'll begin with the delegate from Scandanavia -All we know so far is that our enemy is a robot stegosaur -Like all robots, it must be controlled by human beings, but we don't know who those human beings are, or what they want -We think the robot will be back -We think a gang of international terrorists is responsbile for wanting to create destruction on a grand scale -Anderson, do you have any idea who the terrorists are? -Sorry to say, we have no idea of who they may be -Even INTERPOL has not positively identified them (mummuring) Interpol doesn't know who they are! Then we are in trouble.. -Well Anderson, what are we to do? Wait for them to strike again? -I'm afraid so. We are completely in the dark about them -This is not the work of terrorists -Dr. Brighthead, what do you know of this? -It's the work of Galactor -Yes, Galactor. Galactor is not a human being, he's an alien from space, who has come to conquer the earth -Good Heavens! Where has this Galactor established his base? -We don't know that yet. But he has established a base here on earth, and we'll find it -How Dr. Brighthead? That alien could establish a base anywhere on this planet -G-FORCE will find it -What is this G-FORCE? -A secret organization. Five young agents. They're all smart with backgrounds in science -They're tough. And they all can fly {Romance: The Myth of Summer} Romance is the myth of summer, and it's primary concern is dragon-killing But first let us clarify that when we use the term 'Romance', we do not mean this: {...} But this, the quest of the romantic hero, who must venture into darkness, to kill a dragon, and return the world, to the pastoral {Romances begin in an idyllic setting} That is where the plot starts. Romance begin in an idyllic setting The action revolves around a young man of mysterious origins who occupies a position of low-standing in society {hero is a young man who embodies the pastoral} He embodies the 'Pastoral World' - he is humble, patient, and throughly good in character {...} Typically, he is close to a kindly old man, who senses an amazing destiny, within the heroe's grasp But only advises him how to act properly {...} In the most undisplaced stories, the hero is Jesus, who represents the pastoral so fully as to heal by touch alone As I stated earlier, the Romance begins in the pastoral, moves down into the demonic, and then returns to the pastoral at it's ending This is done through the context of a quest which the romantic hero must undertake The quest involves making it through a labyrinth, to a dark city, where, in the center, an evil tower is guarded by a powerful dragon {trials of hero prove identity} Along the way, the hero wrestles the strongest giant, defeats the best swordsman, and wins other victories, which suggest to the audience that the hero is far more than his apparently humble beginnings have implied {...} The goal of the quest is to free a representation of the pastoral, which is being held hostage We often see this in the figure of a woman forced to marry an evil king a child kidnapped from it's cradle, or just a woman tied up As we approach the end of the quest, the hero must confront the dragon, so he enters the dark tower and finds him {hero is injured} but the hero is injured in some manner And it is at this point in a romance, when the good of the world, the pastoral, seems the most threatened, that something very special happens {romantic identity provides victory over evil} Overcoming injury, the romantic hero recognizes their identity, and that, by itself, provides them with victory over evil This is something we see everytime a superhero puts on their mask the recognition of romantic identity And so the dragon is defeated, the evil tower falls, and with it, the demonic fades back into the recesses of hell {The return of the righteous king} The 'Pastoral World' is restored, which is usually symbolized by the return of the 'righteous king' -And just at the last minute, Spider-Man crashed through the door and saved me, he saved me! {Tragedy: the myth of Autumn} Tragedy is the myth of Autumn Aristotle tells us that tragedy began as an ancient form of art, known as the 'Satyr-Play' in which, an angry God would crash a party of drunken, bestial revellers, to punish them for some offense against the Gods This is where Cyberpunk Film belongs, in the realm of vengeance And we see this image, over and over, in these films, as a 'more than human' character walks through a party, seeking a violent objective -Umm Yeaah. Macho Man Randy Savage, intercontinental heavyweight champion, was in a state of Shock, when Ricky the Dragon Steamboat came back, yeah.. {Satyr: arrogant, swarthy, tricky} But this time, I will not only embarass you, not only pin you with the 1-2-3 count {Satyr: arrogant, swarthy, tricky} -But this time, I will put you out of wrestling for good. Oh yeah, I am lord and master of the ring {Satry: arrogant, swarthy, tricky} -and you're going to find that out, when we go another, right now! -Ok 'Ricy the Dragon Steamboat'. Somewhat special, George the Animal Steele in your corner, but some say this could be your last shot, at the intercontiental heavyweight title {Vengeance God: focused, clean-cut, honest} -My last opportunity. Randy Savage, the day has finally come. The minutes. The seconds. We have reached our moment. {Vengeance God: focused, clean-cut, honest} -As we climb into the ring, we clash like two titans {Vengeance God: focused, clean-cut, honest} -But there will only be one winner. One winner Savage -This dragon is breathing fire. This dragon will scorch your back -I will come away with the championship belt, and see new horizons! {Tragic hero: self reliant, alone} The tragic hero is a king, or authority in this world, but they rule entirely by their own power. They are alone Like the Romantic Hero, the Tragic Hero also has a quest, which moves him downward into the demonic world The Romantic Hero, like Jesus, retains his goodness, but the Tragic Hero does not He becomes integrated into the demonic landscape The 'Pastoral World' retreats, and as the plot advances, we begin to question, whether the hero, is actually good at all {Tragic Quest: Innocence to Experience, Good to Evil} The Tragic Hero is never able to reconcile their original innocence with their new experience and we see them now as an instrument of vengeance. They become cold machines, driven to excess Their desire for revenge outweighs all else As we said earlier, the Tragic Hero, like the Romantic one, must quest downward into hell, and rescue some image of the Pastoral {pathos, death struggle} At the bottom of the great pit, the hero approaches the devil, and the theme of pathos, the death struggle, begins The hero walks forward into near-certain death. They meet the devil It is at this point in a Romance, that the hero discovers their identity, and defeats evil, through a miraculous suspension of natural law Something like this happens in Cyberpunk Film, but in a very different way One of the key characteristics of the Tragic Hero, as mentioned before, is their desire They seem to have some goal, something that they want more than anything else The Tragic Hero is mostly silent. And they seem to be quietly fixated on this objective {excessive desire : hyper moron} In Classical Greek Tragedy, it is this excessive desire, called "hyper moron" which pulls two great states into the Trojan War So, whereas the Romantic Hero is identified when things are at their worst, by their use of holy magic to save the world, , the Tragic Hero is identified when things are at their worst, by their "hyper moron" - the display that they will do anything to achieve their goal {Romantic Hero - Power of Identity} {Tragic Hero - Power of Desire} They walk so far into hell that they can never go back, and they become wraiths in the demonic landscape, driven by vengeance In Cyberpunk Film, they become Machines After the great battle, the tragic hero is recognized as moving too far from the pastoral to ever return {tragic hero fades away} So, they move forward into a wasteland, unable to see what lies ahead of them {tragic hero fades away} they are blind We know, the future doesn't necessarily proceed along a single course there ought to be a future we can choose it's up to us to find it this you knows, the years travel fast and time after time I done the tell but this aint one body's tell, it's the tell of us all and you got to listen it, and remember, cause what you hears today you got to tell the newborn, tomorrow I'is looking behind us now, into history back I see those of us that got the luck and started the haul for home and I remembers how it led us here and we was heartful cause we seen what there once was one look, and we knew we'd got it straight those who had gone before had the knowing and doing of things beyond our reckoning even beyond our dreaming time counts, and keeps counting and we knows now, finding the trick of what's been and lost aint no easy ride but that's our track, we gotta travel it and there aint nobody knows where it's gonna lead still in all, every night we does the tell so that we remember who we was, and where we came from but most of all we remembers the man that finded us him that came the salvage and we light the city, not just for him, but for all of them that are still out there cause we knows, there'll come a night when they sees the distant light, and they'll be coming home (for Byron) {Irony: the Myth of Winter} Irony, is the myth of winter {militant satire} It can fairly said that the key characteristic of the ironic mode is militant satire; ; a sense of looking down on mankind from above , watching the pathetic flaws of a vainglorious humanity being the most demonic of the seasons and modes, Irony often parodies the pastoral themes of comedy and romance, as unrealistic, and manipulative Cyberpunk film uses Irony by incorporating these parodies into it's larger tragic structure {world operates by unholy law} painting a world that operates by unholy law following the law, and fighting for a government, is moved from the heroic terms of romance, and revealed in Irony as unquestioning obedience, and blind patriotism -I'm as bored as a pacifist pistol! When are we going to see some action! ? -Well George, I strongly suspect that your long wait for certain death is nearly at an end.. -Surely, you must have noticed something in the air? -Well, yes of course, but, I thought that was Private Baldrick -Unless I am mistaken, we will at long last be making the final 'big push' -That one we've been soo looking forward to all these years -Well, hurrah, with highly polished brass knobs on! About time It's back. Big is back Because bigger is better. 6000 SUX, an American tradition! -So, what I want to know is, how did we get, from the one case of affairs, to the other case of affairs? -Do you mean, how did the war start? -Yeah -The war started, because of the vile Hun, and his villanious empire-building -George, the British Empire, at present covers a quarter of the globe -while the German Empire, consists of a small sausage factory in Tanginiki -I hardly think that we can be entirely absolved from blame on the imperialistic front -Oh no! No sir! Absolutely not. -Mad as bicycle.. -I heard that it started when a man named Archie Duke, shot an Ostrich, cause he was hungry -I think you mean it started when the Archduke of Austro-Hungary got shot -No, there was definitely an ostrich involved, sir -Well, possibly -But the real reason for the thing, is that it was just too much effort not to have a war -By Gum this is interesting! I always loved history, Battle of Hastings, Henry the VIII and his six knives, all that -You see Baldrick, in order to prevent war in Europe, two colossal superblocks developed -Us, the French, and the Russians on one side -and the Germans and Austro-Hungary on the other -the idea was to have two vast opposing armies, each acting as the other's deterrent -that way, there could never be a war. -but this is sort of a war, isn't it sir? -Yes, that's right. You see, there was a tiny flaw in the planx -What was that Sir? -It was bollocks -So, the poor old ostrich died for nothing. -Why can't we just stop sir? Why can't we just say, no more killing, let's all go home? -Why would it be stupid just to pack it in sir, why? -Now, now! You just stop that Conchi-talk right now Private! -It's absurd, it's bolshevism, and it wouldn't work, anyway -Why not sir? -Why not? W, w, why, why wouldn't it work? -It wouldn't work, it, it wouldn't work. err.. -Now you just get on with polishing those boots, alright? And let's have a bit less of that lip. -Think I managed to crush the mutiny there sir -To think, in just a few hours, we'll be off Is it time for that big operation? This may be the most important decision of your life So come down, and talk to one of our qualified surgeons here at the {family heart center} We feature the complete Jarvic line, Series 7 Sports Heart by Jensen Yamaha, you pick the heart! Extended warranties, financing. Qualifies for Health Tax credit And remember, we care -Don't forget your stick Lieutenant -Bravo Sir, wouldn't want to face a machine gun without this -Listen..our guns have stopped -You don't think -Maybe the war's over -Maybe it's peace! -Hurrah! The big knobs have gathered around the table and yanked the iron out of the fire! -Thank God, we lived through it! The Great War, 1914-1917 -Hip Hip, Hurrayy! -I'm afraid not. The guns have stopped, because we're about to attack -Not even our generals are mad enough to shell their own men -they think it's far more sporting to let the Germans do it (project hope) Ultimately, we often feel that what we see in heroism is less than it should be, and what see in {the pastoral is secretly dangerous} In Akira, we see a failed attempt at a romantic hero, being attacked by his own toys In Blade Runner, we see a parody of the romantic hero's ending unification with his bride In Mad Max, we see a partner so untrustworthy that he is chained to a log, and, and duels, where, at the moment the hero should claim Exalibur, and win the battle, Excalibur, runs out of gas In the opening scene of Aliens, we visit a demon-infested underground city, named "hope" (Hadley's Hope) And in Robocop, we see this: -Red Alert. Red Alert. -You crossed my line of death! -You haven't dismanted your MX stockpile -Pakistan is threatening my border! -That's it buster, no more military aid! -NUKEM: Get them Before they Get You! Another Quality Home Game from Butler Brothers! Ronald Reagan, who liked to dress in the clothes of the Romantic-Cowboy-Hero, is the subject of unending parody in the 1980's (president from hell) {Punk: Music of Irony} And Punk, one of the most ironic forms of music ever created, makes a point of parodying itself as well / it's a beautiful world we live in/ /a sweet romantic place/ /beautiful people everywhere/ /the way they show they care/ /makes me want to say/ /it's a beautiful world/ /it's a beautiful world/ /it's a beautiful world/ /for you...for you....for you.../ /it's a beautiful world...(repeating)/ And now, the Dr. Seuss Bible! One day God said, "this is what I will do" "I'll send down my son, I'll send him to you!" "To clear up this Humpity-Bumpity Hullabulloo" "His name will be Christ and he'll never wear shoes, his pals will all call him the king of the Jews!" He didn't come in a plane, he didn't come in a jeep, he didn't come in the pouch of a high-jumping Voveep He rode on the back of a black Sassatoo, which is the blackiest creature you ever could view He rode to Jerusalem, home of the grumpity Jews, where false prophets were worshipped, some even in twos There was Mirry Von Mir, and Gengis VoVooze, the one you could worship by taking a snooze Christ spoke from a mound, which is a pile of ground, and people gathered around without making a sound thus he spake- Sin and Socks, Socks full of Sin, how do we quiet this Jehovity din? Do unto others as they do unto you, that includes you, young Timothy Foo One Pharisee said to another he knew -What shall we do with this uppity Jew? -We can wash him in wine, and make him all clean, and into Sam Ziddles Crucifixion Machine! Twirl the Gawhirl, and release the Ganeese And in go the nails, as fast as you please! And it is said that he said as they bled, "Forgive them father, for they know not what they do" -For they walk through this life, in toe-crampity shoes -Whooo, youuu? Amen {women in 1980's film} The main purpose of women in 1980's film is to be kidnapped so the male hero can save them This is the classical understanding of gender; men are hard, bound to honour by war women are soft, and represent emotion, and love of the family They are emissaries of the pastoral, living symbols of peace and love Jesus, despite his status as a male romantic hero, is also linked to the classical feminine in this way And Jesus on the cross, women in chains, and other symbols of this type are often used by governments to paint themselves as the romantic defenders of the pastoral The term the U.S. government uses "homeland" is a derivation of "motherland" the placement of the classical feminine image within borders {for the motherland} Cyberpunk film has a more mixed portrayal of women the traditional feminine roles are retained, for the traditional reasons {women linked to the masculine / demonic} But we also see women characters linked to the more traditionally masculine world of steel and vengeance Sarah Connor, for example, a character in the Terminator series is constantly caught between her desire to return to the traditional pastoral role she once occupied and her belief in the necessity that she adopt a traditionally masculine, demonic, one (police 01) The main purpose of minorites in 1980's film is to be shot minorities are given a lesser status on the 'great chain of being' than the dominant group and in films produced by that group, they play demonic roles this is a video from the 80's rap group "NWA" or "Niggers With Attitude" if you turn down the volume and notice the images, what you see is demonic nature, technology and society. The demonic world These scenes could be from George Orwell's '1984' But we also see a similar mythos to Cyberpunk in a heavy use of tragedy and irony and we see the most politically cogniscent groups recognize this similarity between the emerging musical genres of 'punk' and 'hip hop' (some trust in chariots and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD, our God) So what is Cyberpunk? What are these films that meander their way through a dark city somewhere in the future? {Cyberpunk film} We have established that they are tragedies, with strong ironic content Now we will examine their politics -Enough! Look at the big picture! You're all pawns of corrupt politicians and capitalists! {satanic theme} We see a satanic theme in 'Cyberpunk', the tragic hero's confrontation with the controller of the action - God -you were responsible for the deaths of the colonists! -wait a second... -You sent them to that ship! -I just checked the company log, directive 6129, signed Burke, Carter J! This is what we call {"demonic inversion"} the championing of demonic traits as a method of confronting God, and the hierarchy God has created We see the heroes of Cyberpunk attack the strongest modern symbol of hierarchy, the corporation Corporations and Governments constantly advertise their prescence as protectors of the pastoral world They warn: a darkness encroaches upon us, do what we say, or all is lost! {power structure as romantic protector} -In vacation time, we must be ready.. -to do the right thing -the atomic bom- -Duck and Cover! -Cover! -Just as your own family should.. -a thin cloth helps protect them -Even a newspaper.. So we are taught over and over, the government is the romantic hero, and we are good But Cyberpunk confronts this through what is called 'demonic inversion' the demonic hero is celebrated, and irony is used to paint the anti-power as more desirable this makes it easier to understand the gangster rap, heavy metal, and punk movments, {demonic inversion; bad is better than good} all of which proclaim, yes we are bad, and that is better than being good We see this proclamation most clearly in the final moments of cyberpunk film -quite an experience to live in fear isn't it? -that's what it is to be a slave {POP QUIZ} Over the next few minutes, try to identify the genres, archetypal characters, and symbols we have discussed ...one step closer, that's what exxon people say one step closer, at the end of every day cause were dedicated to finding energy for you energy, for a strong America... ...energy, for a strong America it's a goal within our reach, that can help our fellow man! ... ...energy for a strong America...

They put him on the rubber-gun squad. All right, let �s get started. This is what I call the witching � hour. No lessons, no Twelve Steps. This is your time. They told me to put �em in the bag. The pieces. They were so tiny. Little fingers. Every once in a while I �d get a whole hand or... part of a leg. Mostly blood. It was everywhere. Their little fingers were just... rolling around. I dropped it. I... I tried to gather �em up, but there was so much blood. I can still smell it. 21 preschoolers were blown to pieces. Some of their fingers still had paint on �em. They were finger-painting when it happened. You got somethin � to add, Noah? This ain �t the Boy Scouts. This ain �t about helping � old ladies across the street. - He �s just a kid. - Oh, bullshit. He �s just weak, like the rest of you mamsy-pamsy motherfuckers. If you can �t stand the smell of trash, why are you workin � in the garbage business? Maybe he �s not as strong as us. Maybe he never learned to like the smell. (sniggering) You laugh it up, smiley. You sure as shit won �t see me swallowing my gun. So what do you swallow? A fifth of gin? Maybe a little speed? - It ain �t the same. - Yes, it is. Let �s be clear about somethin �. You people landed here for a reason. It �s not just your careers you �re killing �.

Look, I know you mean well, but you �re in way over your head on this one. Do you think words are gonna make a difference, gonna change anything? They �re not. So just do yourself a favour and don �t waste your time on me. Looks like we �re in for one. You know, my Mary had a scarf like that. - We can �t have this goin � on here! - Keep out of everybody else �s business. - Don �t jump over my ass.

What do you wanna do about it? (chuckles) Did you take it? Jack? Maybe you should give it back. Thanks for the light, old-timer. Stupid cops. How you doin �? Do you wanna get some air? If you wanna talk, I �m right over here. Looks like we �ll be in this place a while. Hey! No! It �s OK. It �s OK. It was just a nightmare. Can I help you? Here, take these. They �ll help you sleep. - Would you mind? - Would I mind what? Stayin � a minute. (Jenny gasps) Oh, God. Can �t get through. Storm must have knocked down the lines.

We all knew that. It was just a matter of time before old Humpty fell off the wall. And what about Dudley Do-Right there, huh? What a peach he is. 30 years of bullshit war stories, only to leave his partner for dead. Alone. No one to watch his back. There �s nothin � worse in my book than a goddamn yellow cop. You see what I mean, Doc? You ain �t the Wizard of Oz here. You can �t just hand out courage. You �re real good at kickin � �em when they �re down, aren �t you? - Do OK when they �re standing up, too. - You never stood up to anybody. Yeah? Well, at least I �m there for my women. That �s enough. Hey, Doc! Check it out! (Jaworski) Man overboard! - Get my bag. It �s in the office. - (Jaworski) Earthquake! - He �s had alcohol. - What �s wrong? He �s on disulfiram. Makes you puke if you even smell booze. - (Lopez) He looks bad. - (Doc) Shit! - Looks like he swallowed a damn dog. - Give us a hand. - What do you want me to do? - Hold him. Hold him still. A little Aqua Velva over the rocks? I rest my case, Doc. Hold him. - I want everyone �s belts. - (all protest) Off with them. Now! - Shoelaces, too. - (all protest) Do it! I want the rooms checked every hour on the hour. (Noah) Anything you say, Sheriff. Hey, you know that hospital about ten or so miles up the canyon? - You mean the old loony bin? - Yeah, right. I got a friend I �m tryin � to ring staying � up there. Your friend sick in the head, is he? In more ways than one. Well, the lines are down. You a cop? Thought so. Been a few passing � through here lately. One took a cabin for the night, bought out all my Scotch, damn near tore it down. Another looked like he shaved with a cheese grater. So how are the fish biting? You happen to see what �s goin � on outside? It �s called the dead of winter. I meant ice fishing. I �d love to try my luck. Maybe you could help me out. Maybe. Fact is, you couldn �t have picked a better time of year. We both know that if someone really wants to kill themselves, there �s no stopping it. I know you have to believe that, Jenny. But I can �t. That �s what this place is about. Stoppin � em. I don �t get it. Why do you put yourself through this? You got family, Malloy? - No, I don �t. - Neither do I. No. The job is all I got. I �m not a coward, you know. I know that. But try and remind yourself now and then. That goes both ways. Can �t sleep? I didn �t mean to spook you. I never knew. Knew you could miss someone so much? I didn �t know that. Just remember that sometimes the real bad things in life can make you stronger. What �s the matter, cowboy? Somebody steal your horse? No, I just thought I heard something. Like what? I don �t know. Something. Cock-a-doodle-doo! Good morning to you! Rise and shine, lazy ladies! It �s a wonderful day in the neighbourhood! Wakey, wakey! Oh... Doc! Doc! Doc! Two suicides back-to-back? ! Get Mr Fed in here. He �s seen his share of dead officers. The bruise is in the shape of an inverted V. - What does that mean? - The markings say it �s a suicide. The V is from the noose. If he was strangled, it �d be a straight-line bruise. Hey, Doc. The waiting list for this place is getting shorter by the minute. Still taking bets on who the next suicide �s gonna be? The man didn �t say it was a suicide. He just said the markings say that. And God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death. Neither shall there be any more pain. I �m tearing � up here, Reverend(! ) Shit! I can �t risk finding any more bodies. I �ll have to lock you in your rooms. - Oh, you gotta be kiddin � me! - I need to review everyone �s case files. - Lookin � for what? - Answers. Look, man. Solitary confinement? No fuckin � way, man! - It �s for your own safety. - Nobody locking � me up in no cell! Is somethin � funny? If the idea of a bunch of cops being locked up like common criminals isn �t a joke, what is, then? (chuckles) Doctor Mitchell, can I have a word? - What? - Jack �s missing. Jack �s your responsibility. Maybe he took a joyride. We �re short one snowmobile. - He �ll freeze to death. - He ain �t the only one! Boiler bought the farm. Mm-hm. Manny! Afraid soldier boy �s turned into a human ice cube by now. Yeah, the hell with Jack. Who knows what that crazy fucker �s up to! (bolts door) Conner and Brandon. They weren �t prior suicide attempts, were they? - I want you to lock your room tonight. - Why? Please. Just do it. Damn! Hey! Hey! Come back here! Jack? Jack! Jack! We �re dropping � like fuckin � flies! Knock it off! You �re losing it. You �re all losing it. Slater �s right. We �re cops. What would Slater know about bein � a cop? Bobbies don �t even carry a gun! God forbid I put myself on a par with America �s finest. Shut up! Communications are down. Our meds are gone. One orderly and Doc, who knows where they are! And we got two bodies. That, and you �re all in danger of experiencing DT �s. Sweetcakes, shakes are the least of our worries. You got a medical degree we don �t know about? Let her talk! I �m not talking about the shakes. Grand mal seizure caused by DT �s... can kill you. - Without meds, you �re all vulnerable. - Maybe you should tell them about Jack. Hey, lady? What the hell is he talkin � about? - I don �t know. - Bullshit! You tell �em, or I will. (McKenzie) Jenny, Doc �s missing. Two men are dead. If there �s something you need to tell us, now is the time. - You should check his service record. - I already did that. - The guy was a patient here. - Oh, that �s great! The son of a bitch murdered his commanding officer over in South Korea. Strangled him. Psycho! - And you gave this crazy fuck a job? ! - Come on, Lopez! Back off. Since when did protecting women become your specialty, Malloy? You �re right. It �s not. My specialty... is doing my job... while the one good thing in my life is home, being butchered. You talk about her again, I �m gonna kill you. How �d Jack end up working here? I vouched for him. He was totally rehabilitated. - What about Gilbert? - A manic-depressive. He hates violence. Look, Jack �s got nothing to do with this. I know that. Hey, people! Gilbert found Doc. Jones. Jaworski. Noah. Lopez. (owner) That �s the Scotch drinker, all right. Guess he never made it to detox. - You �re telling � me this guy �s a cop? - Well, that �s what he said. Now, what the hell is goin � on up there? I need to get up there. Whoever did this must have used a sledge. They hammered the living shit out of these carburettors. The snowmobiles are finished. Let �s take the Suburban, go for help. If I had extra hands, we could dig our way out if we get stuck. - (Jaworski) The freezer �s fillin � up fast. - I think he �s right. Hank, take Jenny and Gilbert. Manny can help with the digging. No. Weeks can �t be moved. We need someone here with medical expertise. It �s not a request. You don �t have to be here. Where would I be safer? Riding through a whiteout with some yahoo like Hank, or sitting here in a room full of armed officers? How about you? No way. I �m gonna go down with the ship. You guys go while there �s still some light. We �re outta here! C �mon, Gilbert, let �s go. - Now what? - We can rotate two-man shifts on watch. - Who made you king shit? - He �s ranking officer. - I ain �t in uniform. - I thought SWAT boys were team players. My team doesn �t wait around to get hit by a shitstorm. We are the shitstorm. I �m with Noah. I say we find this crazy piece of shit and Frosty his ass. How do you know it �s Jack? How do you know that? How do you know it �s not... Lopez, or Jones? How do we know it isn �t Slater? How do I know it isn �t you? Me? Yeah... right! You better keep an eye on that one, nursie. He crackin �! Split the building into sections. Each person will clear an area. Point me in the direction. (killer) I see you. Butyou won �t see me. He �ll die without it. Jenny, where �d you find Conner �s body? Hank! Do ya think we can get the truck through yet? Keep digging, Manny. (clunk) What was that? - Gilbert �s gone! - I don �t give a shit where he �s gone! We �re gettin � the hell outta here! Get in the truck. (Manny) What �s that? Look out! Look out! (horn blaring) Anything scares you, kill it. Hank! Where �d you go? Hank! Jack! (footsteps) (footsteps continue, then stop) Jack. (door closes) (door opens) Gilbert! - Wait! - (terrified gasps) (man) Hey. Frozen corpses don �t bite. - You �re used to seeing bodies. I �m not. - It �s OK. Weeks is burning up. I need ice. Will you get it for me? (hammering on door) (hammering continues) Who �s the fuckin � brainiac that locked the door? ! - Shit! - What were you doing outside? Noah told me to check for tracks. - Did you see Malloy? - Why? Should I have seen him? Is there something goin � on here I should know about? (electricity buzzes) (lighter clicking) Jack? Come on, now, Jacky boy... No more games. (groaning) (electricity buzzes) (Jones) Main circuit board died with McKenzie. That means no power, no heat. The emergency lights are not gonna last long. Great! It �s gonna be 20 below in here by morning! (gun clicks) This is bullshit! This is bullshit, Malloy! - Come on. - Malloy! - What happened? - Jack and Manny are dead. Hank �s gone. - Where �s Gilbert? - He saw me and he bolted. - He �s still out there? - I found the missing snowmobile. Whoever took it burned the personal files. - Why? - Makes it impossible to prove who �s who. One of us isn �t a cop. Give me a knife. What are you looking for? What are you looking for? ! - Confirmation! - Confirmation of what? ! I see you. You see me. - He �s here. - What are you talking about? He �s here! Agh! (Gilbert) Dead... We want to help your husband. We can arrange a lawyer. - I wonder who will pay for this. - We will pay for everything. ...in Gdansk Shipyard an agreement has been signed... They signed it. [It's Lech Walesa] Gentlemen from Solidarnosc claimed that I should excuse myself. Here you are. I can explain everything in this matter. It was Friday. I received the first phone call before 6 a.m. They called from the metal works. The first shift did not work and started to argue. The previous day I was walking home on foot and I saw lights switched on in many windows. People were celebrating Jan's birthday. Watching those windows... I don't mean to... Watching those windows... I was feeling uneasy. Why didn't you do anything? Why has nobody tried to get her out? We've done our best. -What did you do then? My child, the war is over. That's the main thing. The Netherlands is a free country again. THE GIRL WITH RED HAIR Yes... I guess you're right. - But can you make it more specific? Since the crimes of the occupier haven't been described... they're not punishable, according to Article 1. Are there any other means at our disposal? Yes, the government can invoke an emergency law. That's the only way to make the crimes of an occupier punishable afterwards. I believe this is the right moment to end this conversation. Miss Schaft, when do you think you can pass your Master's? I won't continue my studies. -What do you mean? I want to suspend my studies for now. -Miss Schaft, are you quitting? No, but I have other things to do right now. Do you think that's wise? As a law student, I have a choice. Talk or do something... I choose the latter. I understand you didn't sign the declaration of allegiance. But I would regret it, if you exposed yourself to dangers... girls shouldn't be exposed to. You've taught me the principles of law. They can't only be defended from one's study. But are these things that extreme? -For me, they are. You have changed. -I apologise. There's no need to apologise. I wish you all the best. Jews are being arrested. Workers who go on strike are being shot. Nobody does anything. You do something at least. Don't get the wrong idea. We're a small group. Our work is dangerous. It can cost you your life. I know. Are you reliable? Yes. How can I be sure? - You can't be. That's exactly my problem. -It's mine too. What do you mean? How do I know you're reliable? My group thinks fascism should also be fought with violence. That's why everybody learns to shoot. Objections? No, but I've never used a gun before. Remember one thing then. Never point at anyone without a reason. You're eight minutes late. -I came from Amsterdam. And, have you changed your mind? No. One shot should do it. She didn't have the guts. -I knew it. Women! -Allow me to introduce Hugo. Wait a second. Take this one. It's lighter and easier. Check if it's ready. Aim. Stretch your arm. That's it. Try again. There can be a bullet there too. Do you ever talk about it? - With whom? With each other? It's better to know as little as possible about each other. I don't want to know anything about you either. What counts for me is that I can trust you. So you can't tell me anything. About what? About the assassinations, for instance... What do you want to know? Have you ever killed someone? Liquidated. Wasn't it horrible? -If we don't do it, nobody does. But not everybody can do it. Hugo's right about that. This work is just as important. The first time was scary. It was someone who'd been betraying Jews in hiding. A hefty man, in a grey tweed coat. I waited for him the whole afternoon. He got off his bicycle. He stood with his back towards me. And then it happened. He only had a few burn holes in his coat. It was weird to see such a big man fall. The strange thing is that he said hello to me as he got off his bike. Who was it? -I forgot. I couldn't do that. It's such a shame. I only wore them twice. You try them. -I prefer these. But we have to do something about our figure. What if I dyed my hair blonde? No. That's more Tanja's style. Did you get the ID card? I was too late. She went to Switzerland. She's quite right. Why can't I go? Use your brains, Judith. You wouldn't succeed. You wouldn't even make it to the Belgian border. Nor would Tanja. You don't know that. I can't stand it here any longer. Listen, I have an idea. I'll find another address. I understand. My parents said... -It's not about your parents. They interfere with everything. I'll find you an address at a farm. And an ID card, so you can go outside sometimes. I'll get on it right away. I'll do it this week. I don't know. Don't say anything to my parents. You know what they're like. Always afraid of everything. A farm? Hold out a bit longer. Who would I have to look after if you're no longer here? Don't you want a warm scarf? -It's not cold. Will you be careful? Do you have to pass a checkpoint to get to Amsterdam? I fixed the light on your bike. Have you got your ID card? -Yes. Have you got enough money? Did you get Judith's things from your room? I'll do it this week. -You can't be careful enough. Bye, sweetheart. MAKES EVERYTHING RIGHT THAT'S WRONG What are you doing here? Have you been waiting long? I went to the university first, but you weren't there. I had to see someone. Is anything wrong? -Judith's gone. We shouldn't have left her alone. When we came home, she was gone. Where did she go? -For you. How could she do that? She doesn't even have an ID card. This pin goes on the left side. They're together. One wears it on the left, the other on the right. I almost forgot. I'd better leave this here. Stop or I'll shoot! Is it convenient? -Is something wrong? Have you heard they're looking for you? Is that why she's here? -No. What's going on then? I asked him to take me here. -You wanted to see me. I want to make you a proposition. Don't tell me you've come to help me. Then I can just as well dob myself in with the Sicherheitsdienst. I'm not asking you anything, I'm offering something. But I won't beg. If you think you can do it alone and you see us as stupid women... Is there anything important? -No. Do the others know you're here? -Which others? Listen. Have a seat. Merry Christmas. Is that why you made me come here? I want to make you a proposition. It's nothing fancy, but you're safe here. You can put your things in here. Decorate it any way you want. Hugo's supposed to be back before curfew. Turn around now! If this had been an assassination, you'd have been dead. Let me provide the cover then. That's too dangerous. You'd need more experience. That's enough for today, isn't it? -No, again. Are you always like this? Always. This is how it goes every day. In the train, he starts bitching about Krauts... and everybody who joins in, gets arrested here. Tomorrow we'll get him. I didn't feel anything. I wasn't nervous either. As if it was a normal thing to do. I can't even remember what he looked like. Did you read what happened? They arrested a couple of people and put them against the wall. Killed them, why? -In retaliation. Terrible. I wonder what these Resistance people are thinking. After every assassination, innocent people are arrested. How can they not realise it? It's good when people try things, but not in this manner. Those retaliations have nothing to do with our assassination. But they might have. -So what? That's the choice we make. We're making sure we won't get the same mess back as before the war. If we hadn't done anything, they'd have arrested people again tomorrow. And your father could have been one of them. What is it? -Nothing. I... didn't like it this afternoon. It was nothing. Except... I feel a bit abandoned. Show me that picture again. What else did you find out? It's unbelievable. She's worked for the Sicherheitsdienst since the start of the war. She's one of their best informers. Last week she had two Jewish families arrested here. Mummy! Mummy! I won't do it. -Then I will. No, not in front of the child. -Damn it. I'm sure I got her. -Well then. And no one saw you. You look like a little girl right now. -Why do you say that? When you play with your hair like that. I do that when I don't feel good. I once got a bald spot because of all the hair I pulled out. Why? There was something with my sister. I didn't know you had a sister. She died from diphtheria when she was twelve. My parents never recovered. I'm sure I hit that woman. We often get anonymous assassination attempts. Such are the morals of these people. Anonymous assassinations, terrorism... We can't investigate everything. But what you're telling me, is very interesting, Mrs De Ruyter. So... she had red hair. -Yes, and she wasn't alone. Don't worry. As a loyal collaborator of the Sicherheitsdienst... you'll get personal protection. Put Neumann on. I don't want any more of it. No more personal initiatives. You don't just endanger yourself, but all of us. You'll go into hiding for a couple of months. We have enough people for the assault on the food office. Understood? Into hiding. Exactly what the Krauts want. Will they understand how we lived, after the war? Nobody will believe it. What do we remember about the previous war? It'll go the same way with this one. A few memories, some pictures... Go to sleep. I thought I'd let you sleep. Stop it, please! It was one big mess. Socialists, Catholics, didn't matter. Once the Germans crossed the border, they were all on a boat to England. Good riddance, it's fine with me. The jenever hasn't gotten any better, though. If Mussert can arrange that, the entire Dutch people will support him. Mussert, cheers. What? If they have a big mouth, we'll send a few WA guys after them. Let me tell you something. Did you know Hitler only has one ball? Pour us another one. Are you sure it was him? -Absolutely. Do you see him? -Yes. Follow him. You shoot first, I'll give you cover. We'll meet in the café afterwards. Keep going! What can I do for you, Miss? I'm waiting for my fiancé. Can we order when he's here? Sure. It's taking a while before your fiancé shows up. Isn't it? -I don't understand it either. Let's hope he didn't take off with someone else. Are you sure you don't want to order? I want to wait a bit longer. -Alright then. I'll have him removed right away. Waiter, two beers and one schnapps. Look at the girl over there. How are you, Miss? How I am? How do you think? Maybe we can have some fun. You German men are real men, aren't you? A whore. Come. -But she looks quite good. She's drunk. What's going on? -They shot someone. Dead? -Yes. Who did it? -I don't know. Take him to the OR. Why don't you talk? That would make everything much easier for you. I forbid you to bother the patient any longer. Leave this ward. Quickly, please. Thank you. It's nothing. Who do those Krauts think they are? I know I'm doing poorly. They got you badly, but don't worry. I can feel it's over. There's a picture in my coat. They can't get their hands on it. -I'll make sure of that. Did he talk? -He's dead. Damn it. That's really bad. He didn't say anything. -He didn't talk but... this. Look at that. Who is it? His lover? It's correct. The photographer remembered the red hair. That's what I thought. We've been looking for her for a long time. The girl with red hair. Here, drink something. I have to turn myself in. -Where did you get that idea? I can save my parents that way. -That's exactly what they want. Then they'll have you too. How did they find out who did it? I don't know. -Not from Hugo, I'm sure. Hugo carried a picture of you. I don't want it anymore. Your bag. Why not? -I don't know. They always know everything. -A man was pretending to be a doctor. What good is that to me? I need his name. Lean backward and relax. I need to know who interrogated Hugo. You are telling me everything, aren't you? I didn't get any prettier. I used to hate red hair, but now that I lost it... No one will recognise you. -No, I don't think so either. The Allies are in North Brabant. The German Occupier wants to discuss a few things with us. So that the governing of the country can be resumed. I urge you to accept the authority of the Domestic Forces. We are in regular communication with the government in London. Through our contacts with the Occupier we have been able to release prisoners. This is only possible if all Resistance groups merge into the Domestic Forces. I assume you are already convinced of the importance thereof. We are counting on your cooperation. Why don't we get better pistols? -You won't need them anymore. We've agreed with the Occupier to avoid unnecessary casualties. That applies to them and to us. The new government will put collaborationists to trial. And no one will escape just punishment. Yes. It was very hard, but I've got it. This is him, Otto Schaaf. Dutch Sicherheitsdienst. He interrogated Hugo. He was also behind the arrest and release of your parents. Good that you didn't buy that. I just don't know where he lives. I'll find out. It's useless. -I don't care about the deals they make. That has nothing to do with me. Your parents are free. The war's almost over. I'll shoot anyone I can still get my hands on. It's pointless, Hannie, you're risking your life. I've got nothing to lose. -We'll get them all after the war. Would you rely on that? I don't trust anyone anymore. Does the group know you're here? No. And they won't find out either, right, Floor? Why are you here anyway? I'm worried about you. -You can go again. You can see everything's alright. Stop, Miss! Are you in a hurry, Miss? I'm on my way home. -I see. ID, please. Are you Dutch? -Yes, why? You speak German so well. ID's alright. What's that? You know this newspaper's been banned. Now we'll see, Mrs De Ruyter. Was it this woman? She had a gun on her. -No, it was a very different type. Have you ever seen her? No, never. Take the glasses off. Have a look at the girl. Think well. No, it's not her. Thank you. Still no name? Well? I never lose my patience. Helping the enemy, sabotage, murder, attempted murder... crimes against the German Empire... armed terrorism. Sign, please. I never lose my patience, you know... Communism, terrorism, romanticism. Give me the names of your communist comrades. You want to live, don't you? It's pointless. You're the girl with red hair, Jannetje Johanna Schaft. That's me. How could something like this happen? A woman like you should be at home. Married to a decent man. Whom you look after. You'll get children. Your husband works. You look after the children. Take her away! Take this woman away. We're taking you to another prison, but first we'll take some pictures. Are you coming? And turn around. Hannie Schaft was murdered on 17 April 1945. Her sister-in-arms An tried to save her from jail. To no avail. Was about time fellas. Bring that generator over here. Alright, alright. I'll tell you. I'm going nuts. I can't take any more of this. You know, it's been 11 days and 6 hours... - Is that all you can think about? Getting Laid? I mean she's coming up tomorrow. I'm not talking about getting laid. I'm talking about that's how long it's been since I last saw her. I'm sorry, I must have lost my head. Jesus, you must think I'm a sex maniac or something. Actually, it's been 11 days and 7 hours since I last got laid. Why would I think you're a sex maniac? What can I say? I looked at the clock next to the bed. I'd like to remember the major events in my life. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Right over there. Mark, we're operating on channel 2. Keep those radios on all the time we're in the mine. Right, right. Any questions don't hesitate to ask Right When we're in the mines the rules are simple enough for you to understand. No fucking around. Watch your step and keep track of your buddies. This place has been closed since 1912, no telling what kind of shape it's in. Danel and I have re-opened a lot of these mines and fellas.. ...as long as you do exactly as you're told there shouldn't be anything to worry about. - You got that Rog? - Oh, yes, sir! - Where'd you find this guy? - Under a rock. Good! He should feel right at home. Ok, move it guys. Get going. - Isn't Frank coming? - Yeah. He'll catch up to us. - He's gotta check in with the office. Great, Brian gets the trailer and we get the shaft. You guys hang back about 10-15 feet. What are we doing? He's checking the beams. See if we have to replace any. That one's alright. That one's alright? That one's alright? Maybe Brian needs some help with the trailer. You know I'm a good trailer man. Come on. This one's gotta go. - Why did they close this mine in the first pace? - Cave-in. I don't think we're getting paid enough for this job. Jesus. - You guys alright? - Yeah, yeah. We're fine. - You smell anything? - No, no. Why? I just shit my pants. You might already be one of interrupt this little surprise. I know what the blind Randes. This is not blind got a date. - Yes, of course. He will come on the weekend to help Jessica to move. Name is Trish, they went to school together. I remember the last thing that you've got a date set up, it's a great girl... Quasimodo daughter. No! Svideæe you Trish. Really! You did? Furnished said. Let there be light. This is it. Yes, you're right, Dan, looks bad. This will suit you. What do you say, want to Treis or want to peaèi? Hell, peaèimo. OK. Better hurry. I'm telling you, with Trisa to get along. Listen, I want the whole weekend to be alone, okay? Good, turn on the lights. I get out of here. - OK. Has perfect tits. Knock it off already. Perfect boobs... - I'm telling you, I saw them. You see them? Both of the two? - Yes, we have taken a hot bath together. Hot bath? Hey, guys, we did a good job today. Let me buy you a drink. Not tonight, Roger and I have to pack. She's moving into a new house tomorrow after work. See you tomorrow! Thanks for the warning! Oh, my God! Shit. Damn deer. Damn. Shut up! Hi, it's me. I'm at home. I thought I'd stop by the house, to light a fire. Coming tomorrow! I got the earlier you do it? I do not think so. Listen, I'll have to spend the night here, because the car was in the ditch. Do not... Derailed deer before me. Unleash it! Because the car was in the damn ditch. Mean me. There is no food, and already starving. No, it's fine, there's no point izostane from work tomorrow. I'll already be somehow car's only problem. I'll be fine. I'll see you tomorrow. I love you. This unit No.147.

Well Brian, it depends on you whether are you going to keep the bag and apron Or you can choose a tunnel No.1, No.2 tunnel or tunnel No.3. Here. Collapse. - Yes. Why they closed the mine 1920s? This is not even on this damn map. These maps are not good. What do we do? - This damn thing is 70 years old. I'll be back and I'll call the office if you have a newer version. In the meantime, you clean up points to this. Let's go! Come on, Molly, you can not do that. You have not changed. I still give female names in my car? I'm still better than Roger.

Come on, little pokvarenjaèe! Come on, Tiger! Jessica, this would not listen to us at all. Yes, I know, this is stupid. Let's go back. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Jesse, this happens every time. What can I say, I said I was sorry. Sweet. Let's drown the little bastard. Here. This is what I went to school? At least I understand this. Holy shit. What is this? - Come and see for yourself. What do you guys think? - This is amazing. This is a natural cave? - Exactly. What is it? - What? - Over there. What you get? - I do not know. Looks human. - Yes, he was definitely one of those miners stuck. Say when do you want guys to pack, I'm for it. Hey, look over there. There are at least 20-30 people. It is, Mark. There were 30 people there. Now there are only 3 man and a huge pile of bones. Brian? Do? It will be better if the sides down here. Silver City is not exactly what I had imagined. Why here? Why did we have to come here ? Saw the homeless there? Look, Roger said that the house was great and will come and Mark. I hope that's the truth. Do not worry Jess, this is a sweet little gradiæ, and I'd bet that the same people and so kind. Hi, how are you? Tigre, stop it! This is my bed. This will be a good track to me and Rodz. The Total sexual maniac. Just purely for information...? It's been 12 days... O, this will not serve you. just distract you with something, I do not think we're going to see a lot of The next three days. I think I'll take a cold shower, because these stories are killing me. But there will be a Mark! This dressed anywhere we can go. There is no hot water. - I thought you wanted a cold. Ice cubes drop from the tap. Where is the heated water in these places? Surely you just need to switch on the heater warmed. Mostly in the basement. Oh, man. Jesus. These little prokletnièe! If I catch you...! Roger, I'm not interested. Uhvatiæu is pocepaæu with all her clothes, piece by piece, until I saw every Deliæ her beautiful naked body. After 'll be entered into spaæu room oboriæu on the bed, poèeæu the toes, after that I'll lick the... Jesus, you're disgusting. Wait! Wait. Just got a call from Denver, we have a few new folder , Roger, you should go for them. You're kidding, are not you, Brian? - I'm dead serious. Brian, my girlfriend had just arrived. It's already 12 days! What am I, damn, damn you got a date line? We're trying to open a mine. What would I go? Yeah, how about we go on? I need Mark, tomorrow we will start to binding wire. Brian, can every other evening just not tonight. I'd rather come here to work but... You do not have to go before 3 am, it should be enough time for what you have in mind. I want you to come back tomorrow afternoon , at 3h40 '. OK. - Do not be late! Yes. What about the car? It'll be up tonight. - We'll probably have dinner in the city? Well, Dan and I are going to play pool with Goat. Come here. Do you take the keys. OK. Around 9am. Yeah, right. OK. We'll see you there. Hey, guy, do not be prenapregne in business. Yes, of course. What are you laughing at? - Oh, nothing. Come on, you would not be able to get laid all night even if he wanted to. What? You doubt the ability of the hormone man? There is a hormonal man! Able to satisfy any woman! Hormonal man against sadness, loneliness and dissatisfaction. Hormonal man! Roger, stop it! Please stop! Please! What's going on here... I thought he attacked a total stranger. No, Trish. What, you did not have where to go, huh? No, I did not want to leave in two . Apologize. I'm Mark. Oh, yes. Bye. Trish. If you do not mind... We'II finish what I have begun. Mind, I definitely considered. Roger, you've been too long in the mountains, infect your brain. Yes, you're right, but my brain is not part of that body who is having problems. Hey, guys, you will not close the door before you start the mission? Hi, Mark. - Hi, Jessica. Good day, Mark. Goodbye. Hello, killer. What is it, Lassie? Jimmy is in trouble? Hey, whatever it is down there, probably twice bigger than you, and in the blink of an eye would have whacked, in it can not be sure. Okay, you ready? Shoot down! Knew... Come here and sit down. Time to man and dog little talk. Uskaèi. Good guy. Listen to me. This will be very Dugaèka winter, especially for if you're not present clear. And the trailers outside is very cold, that says your name, dude. I see you've met with Tiger. I too well. There is beer? In the fridge. Help yourself. Practically, we are cousins. What do you say, Tiger, you want a beer? Mani him, he was still a minor. Is there a couch that you need to tear , carpet that needs to pee? He listens. Well, Jessica had simply threw at me. Did she say what I did Tigris for Christmas? I made a miniature electric chair for dogs. Really done, I'm done. You do it as a hobby or are you a professional performer for dogs? I just used my college education with job, an electrical engineer. And how do you become a miner? Couple company asked me to do electrical engineer them immediately after graduation. I'm not prepared for this. So we came in with Roger mountains to do this mining stuff. This is just a job. So what's your story? Jesse and I are going to the same school. Journalism. They offered me a job in the Denver Post, and I moved from Pennsylvania two weeks ago. So you're a writer? In a weekly periodical. Some kind of wizard. I'm glad I met you. - The same. Excuse me. Oh, hey, come. Thank you. I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking lady who owns this house, Martha Èepmen. I have not seen. Trish? No, I have not seen anyone since we got there, about 4h before. She was supposed to come here because of you. That's when they were last heard of her. We found her car a half-mile of times. My partner potisao papers. I have never met these people. Is that Roger Lavra? - Yes. Is he here? I would talk to him. Well, I'll be in in a minute. O, Jess... Hey, Roger! Better be something good. Listen, that you may not see you and Jessica a woman here... March Èepmen? This is not good enough. Roger, I'm serious. What is this, a joke? - No, the cops are. We are sorry that we could not , to be of greater help. If you find out anything about her, call me, okay? Okay. Thank you. Uhvatiæu it. No! Okay, leave it out to play a little bit. Yes, we obuèili time to clean up. Okay, thank you. Wait a minute. Now that you're already dressed, how about dinner? Nothing personal, but I do not think can not remain there until breakfast. Come on, Jessica. Playful psiæu, you stay here. You can not come, because you do not got a date. I do not savaæe is anything I have bought. This includes socks, T-shirts, chairs, underwear and especially in my shoes. If I catch and eat my shoes then I called Roger to fit just in your little nosiæ. Come on! Coming! He's so cute. Silver City Tavern I just insisted that I go. This is really cool. We get there, and you have to go to Denver. Come on, guys, this is not the end of the world. We have a whole winter. Rodz, is scientifically established that too much sex can be a hazard to health. Hey, you never get to interview miners no employees. But the truth is, too much sex can blur vision, cause loss of coordination... Yes. Let's go already. Food, food. - Come on, come on. When I saw that he could no longer eat, then I ordered the wine. My hero. Listen to me, definitely tomorrow we stop by the shop, we must not lose beer. It would not be the first time. Svratiæemo then and there. Food do you have? - Yes. You have a store here. People do not live on Indian bread. But as I saw it. I thought I'd buy a few things... You need for a cake and tomorrow I'll make a cake. Hey, I remember. What? Tomorrow will be the anniversary of your first orgasm. Son of a bitch. - Catch it! Guess that patient! We have it! Again! Two goals! Here we are. Hey, boss. Hi. I want present to you my girl, sexy Pennsylvania. He's always been like this? - Yes. Guys, this is Trish. Only Trish. Well, would you beer? No, no, no, keys, go on the road for a couple of hours I'll try to sleep, but I do not think I'd make it. me to go with you? - That would really like, but then the sleep would not be anything. Why do not you stay and we'll have fun tomorrow night? - OK. Drive carefully, fella. It's gonna be iced. I want. Thank you very much. Adios. See you Rodz. Guys, know how to play pool? Yes, a little. A little? Here. Thank you. Hey, I was working for the Post. You have not talked to her about this hellish story about mine and its history? A, that, in collapse we found human bones miners. These are the most terrible mining disaster events in local history. This is already something. Yes, a hell of a story. Yes, thank you. 'll Check. Whore! The environment. Damn! Have you seen it? Impressed you? Impressed? I'm angry, sad I was kicked. I have to tell you, guys, I was very nervous when playing in cash. So what do you say, Brian, heading towards? OK. Get them, Pennsylvania. Okay, now you've gone too far! Tigre? Tigre? Tigre? I'd better hide. Tigre? Double or nothing. Well, the money is yours. Not for long. OK, I'm playing. Roger would liked this. Revenge of the working class. Tigre, you little shit, where are you? Tigre? Enough, Tiger! Good, Tiger, you're screwed. To stay hidden and not be found! Hi, beautiful. Do you live here? I'm the new girl in town. I see you looking at me. Probably 've seen my face somewhere already, right. I believe so. Pretty face. Embarrassed you? - No. No, I always react this way when I feel that I catch up with this profoundly depressing, self-pitying. I see. This happens often? Only when I am afraid that I will a beautiful young girl down. There is a chance for that. Do you already said you were a you a beautiful young woman? And did you say that you have beautiful eyes ? I got that cute nosiæ? I got that sexy lips? All this you have already said? Unfortunately, I feel that again crashing into a deep depression self-pity. Please do not stop now. I love to hear the old compliments. I have not stopped. They just ran out of compliments . Oh, I know. How about an old soft music to me? It's good for you? And here is the beautiful music. Oh, yes. Oh, I know already. I know already. Old moonlight still works. Snowing. Okay, okay... snow. How about... How about an old-fashioned romantic fire in the fireplace? An old-fashioned romantic fire in the fireplace? My favorite. I have a fireplace for you. Prove it! Jess, we must go back to the ranch. Thank God. You could not get a another game. I would be embarrassed. Wait a minute, that there is money my son for lunch. Gambling is a sin. Come on, give him a chance to equate . After that we'll take. OK. We'll have money for tomorrow's dinner. - OK. Hi. See you, guys. - Goodbye. Points. Shit! Damn. Fuck. Tigre? Fuck you! You better not hide, you'll get tomorrow certainly Tigre. What the hell? Jesus. But it's true. No, it can not be. This is more like it. Can I get you anything before than light a fire? Yes. God, I like your eyes. No, no, no. My name is Mark. God's the guy with the huge beard... I're funny. I'm not that bad, you know. Where is he? Probably started sooner, because of the snow. the bed. So... Now where were we? Right here. Sorry... I scared you? No, no, no. It's okay. I did not think you were awake. I have not slept a good thing. Have not seen Tiger? Well, we almost had "Manaz and it" last night. I have not seen him since. So, you did not let him out? - No. Why? Not sleep in bed with me last night and I could not find any this morning. Well, already late for work, let's go look for him. Tigre? There you are. What were you doing there? Come. Shakes. We must have scared last night when we yelled at him. I do not know. Hey, listen. I have to go to work. Hey, what do you think of her? Do not Trish special? Very poebna. I'm glad you like it. Hey, I really need to go. Hey, do not forget: èokoladna cake tonight! - Great, I'll see you later. Maybe it was vandals, I guess. Vandals? Pretty weird from vandals. Hey, are you done some more damage? Truck, some of mine? Do not look like that. This is another strange thing. We have a lot of radio in the truck, mostly on the go, but they did not not even touched. Well, someone should keep an eye on the generator, to avoid problems later. It costs 5-600 dollars. Or 1,000. Yes. Well, as we said they were vandals, that's all. Pretty weird by vandals. Damn weird from vandals. Remind me not to budge. Are you finished with the bathroom? - Yes. Well, it's pretty clean for mountain girls and miners. Good. Two hours I need. What this great store? Right to Let us not budgets. Oh, yes. It smells great. Happy coming home. I would join. 're Not even thinking about getting married? - I hand over this bizarre connection? Seriously. Could you imagine Roger as a father? No. Probably our children were mischievous little brats who would drink beer all day. No, thank you. You made the list? - Yes, there is on the table. Good. Svratiæu to the grocery store as soon as I ended up in the office. I really want to write about the mine? At least I will have a press kit. If you forget something, call me. OK. Hey, thanks for the bathroom. Bye-bye. - Hi. I worked at the Post. Seriously? Yes, in 1953. year. In 1953. and 1954's. Really? The extension. I was the first raznosaèica newspaper. You know I could write about this topic: First raznosaèica newspaper in Denver. Yes, this sounds fascinating. It'll definitely remember. It was a summer in 1953. A Articles Resources on mine? O, that erosion. How's it going, guys? - Great. What are you doing? - I want to take some samples. Before you come from a surveillance... I'll send some samples to Denver for analysis. I want to ask you something about these bones. Yes, what about them? If these died from gas or because of lack of air, or from hunger... Their skeletons should be separated, rather than a pile of bones. Yes, you're right, this is really weird. OK, we're done with this. Roger would ever need to return. I want to call the office and ask when he was there. We need the maps should work in these tunnels afternoon. I am sure that there are no problems , otherwise the call. Well, you certainly find out! OK. Come on. Come on, do not give me a hard job. Now this is more like it already. They wrote a lot of stories about these collapses. What is this? Lieutenant in the U.S. Army limo was sent from Denver spasilaèku to lead the operation. But by the time he arrived on Tuesday, anyway... Rescue camp was abandoned... This is weird... Do not write why they broke up with a rescue. Why did I tell you that in this day and age write worse. This should see. Listen to this. Suspect that it was done by a miner named Harold Griswold, who caused the tragedy. Griswold was the only man who survived the collapse of , But was not able to testify in court on accident in a mine... Remanded to hospital for mental health problems . Why would a man mad? Hello? Yes. It's for you. A girl by the name of Jessica. Thank you. Hi! - Hi! You look like a real miner. What's going on, huh? So, what's up? I do not know. Roger had problems with the car or something? Why? Well, I've spoken to Jess, she looked garage and pick there. Brian's pick? Yes, I do. Roger's with the should go to Denver. Came back? It's already to come back now. I do not know. I mean, I, we have not heard about it. I'm talking now with the Denver office, but Roger has not appeared there. Do you think he had the accident on the road? - On With what? The car in front of his house. Might be stopped. Roger did not want to go so in Denver. This is really weird. Yes. Do you want to hear something else weird? Well, I was in the office of the press by some articles of the collapse. I one of the miners actually pulled, and said that they were attacked. Attacked? Yes. Supposed to testify here in Denver but totally freaked out, went crazy, after he was transferred to a mental hospital. This does not seem to have much sense. - A lot of things now, so it seems. Listen, I want to now go back to the Jessica, right? 'll Talk with Brian, I'll see if he can let me go early. Okay, great. I have to stop and pick up some groceries. What do I say? Tell her I'll find out what's going on, and tell her not to worry. OK. And do not you worry. See you soon. Hey! Where are the rest of the bags? Need for samples. Got there a couple. OK. Pogledaæu. Oh, shut up. Tigre? Tigre? What hell are you doing? - Any of something in the water. Come on, you're imagining things. Not imagining anything. Something floating there. You reach? Yet. What the hell? - I do not know, but it's stuck. God! This is Roger! My God. Jesus Christ, look at his face. Well, get it. This is the young man who work for you, right? Who's there? You could not leave them alone , is not it? You had to set them free. Who are you to hell? I warned you. Warned? Damn. You've set the damn cross? Now we have to close them again, is not it? What are you, the hell you talking about? You let them come out. And now we have to close it again. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, Mark! Your friend... is dead. Jesus. But Roger was at home. The mine was closed. How is it possible... These tunnels water everywhere under the city. They are associated with the home. Your explosion freed them. Popeæe through tunnels and uhvatiæe them. Through the tunnels? Tunnel to the house. Girls! Go get them! You go get them! Come on, for God's sake, go get them. I bring some help, hurry up! They are... They closed my father... An asylum, after the great collapse. No one did not believe him. I would check out the tunnels over the years. To make sure they are well sealed . I checked and tunnels at home, too. Yes, I'm sure this There you go nagging again! Didn't I ask for us to never see each other again? Why can't you understand? Hey! You watch what you're saying. We don't want to see you either. But what can we do? Your younger daughter... she's at our house now. What? - Why is Jung In there? - Why, do you think? Chauffer Kang, after all those people have left, I'll go and get her, so stand by with the car. Hey! Hey you, how long will you treat my father like your chauf...? Be quiet! I'll go and see if those people have left. Father, really. How long will you put up with...? Man, why does it have to be them? Let's go. You go. Why did you come along, only to be misunderstood like that? See here. Drinking doesn't solve anything, and my family will worry when they find you missing. Do you think I'm in a position to think of other people? To you, they may be other people, but to me, they're my precious family. Ahjumma, one more bottle of Soju here. Don't give it to her. This woman doesn't have any money. Ahjumma, I'll give you this for a bottle of Soju. Isn't that your wedding ring? I... have been dumped. Even so. Marriage? Vows? I don't need any of them. Love or whatever... they're just empty words. - Wasn't it fair play? - What? From what I gather, his family's wealth was a consideration in that marriage. Wouldn't you consider the finances when you get married? Why are you talking down on me? How old are you? You've never been married, right? - What? - If not, you don't have anything to say. I'm not in the situation to consider age and proper usage of the language. Want a drink? No, thank you. Aigoo, I give up. Please tell Grandpa to live a long life for me. As for myself, I'm just going to drink myself to death. Love? Of course that's important. Marriage? That's not so important. It's nothing nowadays to have been married. You're right. Everything Oppa* says is right. (*Oppa: female addressing an older male) Right. Everything I say is right, so let's go home. Wait just a sec...a sec... What now? Hyun Soo Oppa. As a man, tell me, it's all over for me, isn't it? Seo Jung is now crossed out. Hey, how many times do I have to tell you? In this day and age, to have been married is not a flaw! Right! But I'm so humiliated. All those people that attended my wedding, I wish they would get amnesia. Oppa, do you know that Han Se said he would die if I weren't around. A person who said he'd die without me, dumped me, because my father's company went bankrupt. Therefore, who will marry me now? What are you talking about? You're a great catch. If you want to, there's no reason you can't again. - Really? - Yes, really. So let's now really go home. Then, can you marry me? See that? Even a loser like you doesn't want me! I'm finished! It's all over for me. No, it's not that. I already have someone that I care about. You're lying. Why would I lie to you? It's the truth. It's been eight years now. Eight years! Not so loud! Who is she that you've loved for eight years? - Who is she? - Okay, okay, okay. I'll tell you, I'll tell you. I call her Beatrice, Odette, Hippocrates, Monad. Be.. Be.., what? If you don't know, just listen! As if by fate, she was there everywhere I went. It wasn't that you were stalking her? I came to volunteer to serve! Please come this way. Oh, that fatal beauty! We did volunteer work together for the village. Even though we were given different tasks, my eyes noticed her every movement. She is Beatrice, Hippocrates' love in the flesh! I know who that is! "Know thyself", it's the person that said that, right? It's a person from the same village. Bear it. Bear with it a bit longer. Just a bit longer. How lucky he is. The guy that received her care probably saved the world. I wanted to get hurt. I needed to be sick! So I made a decision there and then, putting my life on the line. Even the heavens were on my side. There was no wind that day, and the blistering sun could have set the field on fire. And that sun said to me, "Let's go for it, Hyun Soo!" - So you passed out? - Yes, I did! Hyun Soo! Hyun Soo! That kid... - Hyun Soo! - What happened, Sunbae*? (*Sunbae = Senior) Even in the midst of all that confusion, I heard her voice distinctly. And, she did everything she could to save my life. She performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on you? No! It seems there were other options. Hey, Hyun Soo... [Seo Han University Volunteer Organization] Cheers. On the last day, I knew I had to grab the chance. However, creatures other than the butterfly landed on the beautiful flower. Even horseflies landed on it, not knowing it's off limits to them. That's something I know all too well. I needed a fly swatter to chase away the horseflies. That swatter was my courage! Seo Jung Kyung! My Beatrice! I care for you. Let's be together! Accept this drink from me. Hey, you! Are you okay? I'm not. No! Ow, that must have hurt. That slap was the first time she and I had "skinship." Oh, how humiliating for you. No. From her hand, there was a scent of perfume. What a pervert. Don't you know it's only the beginning that is difficult? After that... Seo Jung Kyung! I've been drafted. You'll wait for me, won't you? I'm going abroad to study. You'll wait... You'll wait for me, won't you? The timing was always off. She slapped me because she felt something for me. If you don't care for someone, don't you just disregard him? Then... Han Se's mother still has feelings for me? - Is that her? - Give it back. Let me see it! Isn't she pretty? I think I might have seen her somewhere before. Where would you have seen her? She resembles Monkey Girl. She looks just like a girl I know. You've had too much to drink. Let's go now. The wench. - What? - And she looks just like a fox. Always acting like she's better than me. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Why are you talking that way about someone you don't even know? In that situation, all she could do was give me 10,000 won*? (*US$8.50) If you don't want to go home, I'm going without you. Fine, go. Who's stopping you? Han Se left. Why wouldn't you go also? Don't regret it. Regret? Huh! Make sure you don't regret. That wench is not for you! Ahjumma, how much do we owe you? 20,000 won*, please. (*US$17) Ahjumma, one more bottle of Soju here. Aigoo, you're drunk. No more. That girl has no money, so don't give her anymore to drink. What are you saying? I have money. Hello? He.. ll..o? Are you drunk? Yes, I was going to drink myself to death. Why don't you come here? Right now! Are you coming or not? Hurry up and get here with my 10,000 won! Where are you? Well, why should I care whether she lives or dies? Of course! Why would I? What does that have to do with me? Where is she? Grandpa? What's this? Oh, my goodness! Grandpa! Agasshi, wake up. You can't do this here. Get up. You can't do this. You're driving me crazy. Aigoo, hurry over here! How could you leave behind someone as drunk as she is? Hey. Hey, hey, hey! Wait a sec. Hey, wake up. Oppa? Jung Kyung, what are you doing here? Is there a girl here drinking by herself? She has just left. Jung Kyung, just in case you misunderstand, that girl you saw is nothing to me. I met her for the first time today. Really. Do you want to go somewhere to talk? What brought you here tonight? Or you wanted to have a drink. Should we have a drink together? Oppa! I think I'm going to throw up. She's making me insane. Jung Kyung, give me just a second. Kang Hyun Soo. Just like you said, you really did change a lot. What? The change looks good on you. Go and tend to her. Jung Kyung, I think you've misunderstood. That's not the way, she's nothing. No.. no... no.. No, no, no, nooooo! Hurry and wake up. Get up and tell her right away. Hurry! Hey! Get up and tell her! Tell her there's nothing going on between us! That we're nothing. Right away! Wake up. Wake up! What are you doing? You're really...! Get up! How can we face Jung In? She's probably very traumatized. That's why I told you to stay at home, and said that I would bring her back. I wouldn't know who would come to the door, and when. How can I stay there by myself? You're making such a big deal over nothing. Are you the wife of a businessman? Come on. Can't you see how upset she is? Didn't you see the windows they broke? You have no idea. It's a good thing Chauffer Kang and Sang Hoon were there. What? Sang Hoon? Oh, my head! - Are we getting close? - We're almost there. Don't be so fidgety. You're disturbing my father's driving. Like it's some big deal. Hey, do you have a driving license? When did I have the chance to drive? You think hiring a chauffeur is just for fun? Then what are you going to do from now on? I'm sure you can't afford a chauffeur. Oh! My son just returned from the US. He received a degree in Automotive Design. He can teach you how to drive. Oh, no. I forgot. He'll be lecturing at the university, so he won't have time to teach anyone to drive. But, you won't have a car, so what's the use of getting a driver's license? Correct? I see that as you age, you're becoming more wordy. Doing simple work must have brought on early dementia. Do you want me to refer you to a hospital? My older daughter is a doctor at the Seo Han Hospital. Oh, really? That's great. Don't worry about me. Take your younger daughter back. I think she was extremely traumatized. Chauffer Kang, don't you have anything to say? Are you sleeping while driving? Would you like me to turn the radio on? We meet again, we meet again That intolerable man As if we had agreed on the time and place We meet again What great lyrics. Do you know that within that song is an entire lifetime? Didn't we say not to ever see each other again, and here we are together? So what this song is saying is that you never know what can happen. Correct? Be quiet, and "Don't disturb my father's driving". - I'm fine. - Are you? Oh, my head! Just one last time. Just once more. How many times have you said "last time"? President, we're very busy up front. What are you doing here? Okay, okay, okay. Now, I want to live with just my immediate family. We always have to rent out rooms, and I have to take care of the tenants. I have to even wash their clothes, and feed the employees of the auto shop. But do you know, I never complained. I always did everything my father-in-law said. I married into this family 30 years ago, and I haven't even bought myself a new outfit. *Yeah, but over those 30 years, I paid for your brothers and sisters to go to college, *He is playing the role of her father-in-law *and made sure they were all married off. I'm not patting myself on the back, but I did as much as I could for your family. Did I spend the money on myself? We lived frugally to save money for all of us to survive. Stop. Ahjussi. We were talking about the room we rent out. Why did you bring my siblings into this? Wasn't it the room rental that provided the means to educate your siblings and to marry them off? If you can't think of anything to say, start crying. You'll never be able to win over Man Bok with just words. How can I cry if the tears won't come? What do you mean? You wring out tears like wringing out a rag! Well that... that is because whenever I face my father-in-law, my tears get scared and go into hiding. Aigoo! That's your disease. Take this. Must I resort to using onions? Just you wait until tomorrow when you become sober. You'll die. Just be quiet. If it weren't for Grandpa, I would have left you behind. Why is she so heavy? I can't believe... I should just throw her out! If Mom finds out about this, she'll lose her mind. Chauffeur Kang, you live in a place like this? Oh yes. It's all due to the generosity of the late Chairman. Don't say that to anyone else! My father who's in his grave will be criticized. - What's wrong with our house? - Hey! It's not even as good as our servants' quarters in which you used to live! What? What an idiot. He has no idea how much the land here is worth. Honey, I'm thinking I might see a ghost here. Let's hurry and get Jung In, and leave. Turn off the lights before coming in. Okay. Why are those people here? They came to take their daughter home. Well then, that's good. Why? What am I going to do? Why are you taking off my clothes? Just be still. For now, she... Hyun Soo! Grandpa! Grandpa! That rascal! Take your hands off my daughter immediately, you rascal! How dare you put your hands on my daughter! Hey! How dare you hit my son? Who do you think you are to lay your hands on my son? You have no idea how precious my son is! You don't know what my baby means to me! Why did you hit him? C.. C.. Chauffer Kang! Why are you bringing in my father-in-law? You beat my son, now you're calling for him? Mom, Mom! Stop. It's okay. Stop! Your son was taking off my daughter's clothes. We all saw it. You saw it, didn't you? How dare you make up such an idiotic story? - Idiotic? - Ammie*! (*Ammie: name for daughter with children) Father, you saw him assaulting our Hyun Soo. All of you, stop! She got drunk and vomited all over herself. You rascal! Don't make up stories! What are you doing on this bed? Get off! Don't touch her. You! Jung Gil, get your daughter out of here. - Why are you pulling me? - Who's pulling you? Everybody! Stop! All of you, come out here. Wait a minute. Did Chauffer Kang just give us an order? Isn't that ridiculous? - Honey. - You just wait here. Hey, Chauffer Kang! Jung Gil was the one who started it by hitting him, Father. That's right. How dare he think our Hyun Soo is capable of that! Young Master or Young Explosive... whatever. Who does he think he is? What? An explosive? Chauffer Kang, is this how you train your daughter-in-law? You! How did you train your daughter for her to get that drunk, and create chaos like this in someone else's home? This bas.... Chauffer Kang! Why is he your chauffer? You've fired him! Just get out of our house! Be quiet. Everyone be quiet! Hyun Soo, explain what happened. What happened was... I'm going to set fire somewhere. Why? Oppa? So I carried her on my back, brought her home, and she vomited all over. What? Then if it wasn't for you, she'd have passed out on the streets. Hey kid. Are you making up stories about my daughter getting drunk? Hey! Stop making trouble, and get out of our house! Don't worry. Even if you beg me to stay, I'll go! All the big talk in this place that you call a house. - What? - Honey, help me here. Why are you falling over...? - Honey, let's hurry and get out of here. - Okay. - Chauffer Kang. - Yes, yes. We'll talk when I get back. You don't need to come. Don't move from there. Every single one of you makes me sick! Let's go. Leave our blanket here! At attention! At attention. At attention. Let's go, go, go. The other way. The other... this way. Right. Turn it. More, more. Turn the wheel. Yeah, like that. No, the other way. Back up. Let's go. If you saw her drinking, why didn't you stop her? You just sat there and watched? Of course, I did try to stop her. However, she just wouldn't listen. Did all of you agree to start talking back at me? And why aren't you bowing? Yes, Grandpa. And you, Ebbi*. What was the real reason for you wanting to go there tonight? (*Ebbi: nickname for son with children) Well, I just wanted to see if there was anything I could do, but that Jung Gil started picking on us. Is that something that could come from the mouth of a 50 year old man? Do you know that if you misbehave, it's your parents that are blamed? Do you know or not? I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry, Father. You accomplished something great today. - What? - You weren't even funny. In front of your father-in-law, fighting, talking back. Even using profanity! I was very wrong. I just lost my mind when I saw... And, who gave you permission to turn that room into Hyun Soo's? Um... Father... uh, that was because... uh.. Honey. What? Hey, can you make your tears come like that? Do you want me to make them come? Pardon? Grandpa, please forgive me. Actually I asked Mom to do that room up for me. This kid goes to America, and left his mind behind. Give me back the money I spent sending you abroad. Father, it's all my fault. Hyun Soo didn't know anything about that room. I did it on my own. I just wanted... Why are you crying? Did somebody die? You must think I'll just let it go if you cry. Don't think that for a minute. Empty that room by tomorrow! Father. Father. Father... Father. You know what Hyun Soo means to me. Please let me do this for my son. Just once. Please just this one time, let me fulfill my motherly duty. Please let me do this, as his mother. If you make me empty that room, the past two years working to buy a new bed and new furniture would all have been in vain. It'd all have been futile. Enough of that!

I'm going somewhere to kill myself. Don't look for me, and have a nice life. She and I are nothing. If you're that uneasy, just take me. Have you seen my ring? Hey! Why are you here again? Let's give it a real try. Here, have a drink. You snob. The title to your house... You're pathetic. Seo Jung In, you're seeing someone like him after breaking up with me? Aren't you lowering your standards? Grandpa, help me. Please do NOT hardsub/stream our English subtitles on any streaming site. Please do NOT hardsub/stream our English subtitles on any streaming site Brought to you by HaruHaruSubs Come on, everyone together. Episode 5 One, two, three. Here, here, let's eat. Everyone eat. Here. Honey, I really didn't expect you would like this so much. I will definitely treat you better in future. Mom, I guess you were depressed because of the room, right? I am sorry. From now on, you can only sleep in that room. Of course. I'll make some tofu soup and bring it. Father, that... Today is our 10,950th day anniversary of meeting. We wanted to celebrate it... Please come in. Come, please help to carry this. Quick. Fa... Father. Father, what's going on? Oppa, hello. You... you... What are you doing? Why aren't you coming in? Seo... Seo... What happened, Seo Jung Kyung? You were eager to come here earlier! I'm sorry to trouble you all. Jung, Jung, Jung, Jung... Kyung... Kyung... Seo Jung Kyung. It should be your first time meeting my sister. He is Chauffeur Kang's grandson. Kang Hyun Soo. Sister? Sang Hoon, what are you doing? Hurry up and take the luggage. Then, Grandfather... Which one is our room? Room? What room? Young master's family will live in our house for a while. All of these people are going to live here? Father, you didn't even tell us in advance. What? I will host my guests in my own house, do I need your permission? We haven't greeted elder agasshi properly? Hurry up and greet her. Yes, I am... It's first time we meet. I am Seo Jung Kyung. What are you doing? Yes... I am Kang Hyun Soo. Chauffeur Kang, I am tired to death. We still have time tomorrow, why are we greeting now? Where is our room? This way please. Okay. Father! Didn't we agreed that Hyun Soo will use this room? Move. This room is for my guests. Please go in. This room. Hurry. Jung Kyung is the granddaughter of the late Chairman? And I said, I wanted to date with her. - Let go of me. - Honey. It's only a few days. A few days. It doesn't matter if it's a few days or a few hours. I just don't like it. Mother, the guests will hear you. Honey, hurry up and go to Hyun Soo's room and kick those people out. Calm down. If you keep this up, we will be kicked out. Chauffeur Kang, are you kidding? Come out, who do you think I am? How can four person stay in such a small room? Please endure it. Aren't you staying only for a few days? Let go, let go. Honey, Jung In, Jung Kyung, come out. Let's go to a hotel. Where will we go? Where? We don't have any more money, where else can we stay? Father, don't bother Grandpa. Come in. Hurry! - Jung In. - Hurry up and come in. It's not like that. It's not supposed to be like this. Jung In. Just take a look around. Where do we sleep? Do you want us stand still while sleeping? You ought to say how we sleep then. Tell me how. Then young master, you and I can sleep in my room. Me and Chauffeur Kang? The policemen already know that you are here with me. Before your departure to America, you will be staying here for a while. I think this is the best way. Best way? Don't you know how we were living before? Still you propose that? If you are that dissatisfied, then leave. My headache. Because of your scream, she has a headache now. Me? This won't do. Jung Kyung, let's go to the hospital. Honey, you have claustrophobia, right? Because of the crowd. Does it feel very stuffy to suffocate? Let's go, let's go. Seo Jung Kyung, think of a solution. Jung Kyung, why is my heart trembling like this? Honey, the medicine, medicine. Honey! Who isn't feeling well? Hyun Soo. - This is the restroom. - Here is the medicine. Here, water. Is she okay? Her body is very frail. I should hurry and get them blankets. I will do it, Grandfather. Father. I said, kick them out! What are you doing? Don't you see that she is not well! Throw up, throw up. Throw up, throw up. It's too messy, I can't take it. It isn't a stranger's house, but a driver's house. This hurts my pride a lot. What can we do? It is just for a few days. Once we can contact Sung Joon, we can go to America. Aigoo, really. by the way, a place like this, Sang Hoon even said the land value is pretty high here, he can sure lie. At least Mr. Sang Hoon still has this house. Are you comparing me with Sang Hoon? Also, why are you calling him Mr. Sang Hoon? Honey, why are you that frivolous? How... how can you say that? Listen to me carefully. This house belongs to Chauffeur Kang. The only thing Sang Hoon has is the telephone. You don't even know the full situation, really. Hey! Why were you pacing around in front of this room? That... I am getting blankets for all of you. Be careful. Last time I forgave you because you were drunk. If you touch my daughter again, you are in trouble. Where's Mother? I don't know. Why are you coming in? Won't you sleep in Grandfather's room? Jung In, making me and Chauffeur Kang sleep in the same room... Then, I still have to talk to dad about my wedding present. I know, I know. Sleep well. Sleep well. I understand. I am here to bring blankets to you all. That's right, Unni. This house doesn't have a shower. Fill water in a red basin, then bath. Also... if you open the hot water too long, Ahjumma will be unhappy. Time to get used to cold water. (informal way) It isn't that exaggerated*.... (*added to be formal) Yo*. Use hot water. Hot water. Don't get a cold. If you look, you will know that my older sister and I are different. She is very sensitive. So Oppa, tell your parents not to be so mean to her while she is living here these few days. Do you understand? Of course, it should be like that. Of course. Then, I believe in you, Oppa. Young master, you should sleep here. You want me to sleep next to the door? This side is much more comfortable... Just because these few days I am troubled, don't treat me bad. I am Seo Jung Gil. Sleep well. Turn off the light. Do you want to me to turn it off? Jung Kyung. Did you know it? What? Chauffeur Kang never mentioned me? No. Really. He never did. If I knew, I would have told you. That way you and I can get closer even easier. Is this a normal fate? No, this is the destiny of fate. Destiny. Don't exaggerate. The adults' relationship have nothing to do with us. It certainly looks like that. No matter what, it was unintentional for us to bother your family. I am sorry. What bother? It is not like we don't know each other. To be honest, if I knew that you were Chauffeur Kang's grandson, I wouldn't have came here. We already said not to meet each other again, and because of this matter, we meet again. It's a bit... awkward. I know. I thought it over too. You must have a lot of things to worry about, and yet I still asked you for dinner. Kang Hyun Soo, can I ask you for a favor? Anything, just say it. We are only to bother you for a few days, pretend that you don't know me. Can you do that? Of course, we missed the opportunity to explain it already. But during your stay, if you have any problems, you should tell me at anytime. Then let's think of it as a promise. I am going back in. That is enough progress for today, Hyun Soo. Where did you go? I couldn't fall asleep, so I went outside for some fresh air. Hyun Soo, you can do it. The Goddess of Destiny is standing by your side. He still thinks about love in this situation? What are you doing? You scared me. Why aren't you sleeping? Did you see my sister? I don't know. The electricity bill is quite expensive. Go back to bed. Today is your first time meeting my sister. How does it feel? What? Is she just like me? Not a bit. How can two sisters be so different? Is she really your sister? Every time I see you, you look less like Grandfather. And you look nothing like your Mother. You were found under a bridge, right? You... don't randomly say nonsense. Act your age. Hey! Hey, what? How can you treat your oppa like that? As a woman, really. That's true, not all mountains are the same so not all women are the same. If I say any more to you, my mouth will be tired. Even so, unni and oppa... Unni, what about unni? Did she say something about me? Yes. It's nothing. The electricity bill is quite expensive. Go in and sleep. Why are you caring about the electricity bill? Sit down, sit down. What are you trying to do? Stop, why are you, two sisters, talking about other people? So, what is it? What did she say about me? That... If there is anything you are uncomfortable with, no matter when, you can tell oppa. What did she said about me, you should tell oppa too. She said I should respect oppa, because you are the grandson of Chauffeur Kang. She says good things about me. And? And what? There isn't more. Isn't this the first time you two met? That's right. I am going to sleep. Sleep well. That's why he got slapped. Hyun Soo, tell Grandfather to come out and eat. Get up. It looks like this family is going to eat breakfast. I am tired, I don't want to eat. You can't be like this at someone else's house. Hurry up and get up. Hurry. Faster. Aigoo, you really make me mad. Why are you two still arguing here? Be quiet. Two face. What? If you want to pretend that you are a know-it-all, then go and eat by yourself. Don't take us with you. No one in that family have manners. And I thought the older daughter would be a little better. Mother, that isn't the older daughter's voice. It's the younger daughter's. The younger daughter's. How would you know? What? Didn't she come here before to look for the ring? That time she was loud and whiny like now. Then, right now she is getting mad at her older sister? A family with no manners at all, really. If she was my daughter, I would slap her at the spot. Mother, be careful. Did you sleep well? How can I sleep well? Mother. What great meal did you prepare, to wake someone up so early? Did you sleep well? I slept on the floor. How can I sleep well like that? Father. My daughters. You are going to the hospital, right? It must be hard on you. Our big young agasshi is going to be late, right? Here, sit here. Sit. What is that? My family eats meals like this. How much you want to eat rice or so, you just put in here. Are you playing with me? No. About the sleeping place, since the house is small, I didn't make a fuss about it. The meal has to at least look decent. I am very sorry. Starting from the next meal, we will prepare one separately for you. Father, eat. This isn't like some military boot camp food. People who have never done military services shouldn't be talking about camp food. I look awful after sleeping. Are you going somewhere? Why are you putting on make up even there is no occasion? My mother would put on basic makeup even when she goes to bed. When did I do that? Such an old plate. Is it washed clean? I lost my appetite. Just eat it, it looks quite delicious. Eat more, it should suit your appetite. There's no meat? I want to eat meat. My family doesn't eat meat. We only eat vegetables that are good for our body. Vegetables. I am not even a vegetarian. It's not that I want to complain, but I don't even know what I should pick with my chopsticks. Eat slower. How can you still eat so much of this? I am eating this because I appreciate their effort, did you think that it was because it tasted good? I really can't take this anymore. Get me some coffee. No one in my family drinks coffee. Right, Father? Also, if you are not eating, why did you get so much? Who would want to eat your leftovers? Can't you just throw it away? Unless, you eat leftovers. No wonder why your stomach is so big. What? What did you just say? Let me eat in peace! You can't eat, right? A person who only eats bread and drink coffee in the morning. I don't know who you are trying to impress to do things you don't do before. I am going to go to work in the hospital. I am leaving first. Really? Chauffeur Kang, take her. - Hey, right now my Father is eating. - It's nothing, I am finished. It's okay, right now the bus would be faster. I am leaving. Come back as soon as you can. I am done eating. Why are you in such a rush? Finish drinking this soup. It burns! Burns! How can he drink such hot soup that fast? You found the bus stop? There is a bus that directly takes you to the hospital. I also use that bus. Today is the first day that I'll give a lecture. When are you getting off work today? I am afraid you might get in danger. Danger. This road at night is quite dangerous. I am sorry. But can I get on the bus first? Thank you. You came early to work today. Let's start with an espresso today. That, are you running away from home? What? What's with the suitcase? I don't have time to sleep, so going home is too bothersome. What's wrong? Because I took out my suitcase, are you afraid that I am going to ask to be your roommate? What? I should take this chance to live in Director's house. Can I do that? Lately, one Eun Jae already gives me a headache. Because that child is going through puberty, she is more rebellious. You feel that Eun Jae is such a headache? Then, don't let other people know, and stay with me here tonight. What? Doesn't Director need to make a research lecture next week? You can't think about other things. Concentrate, do you understand? Concentrate. I understand, little girl. Kang Hyun Soo. What happened that day? You didn't greet me and ran away. I am sorry, because that day... Alright, you were the one that helped us get the research funding, so I will let you go this time. You signed it? What else can I do? The conditions are quite good. Next week, start working at Global Motors. What? Lee Han Se is ambitious. A heir should be like that. You two must cooperate well. I have already discussed it with the other side for you to lead. Whoever you want to take in there, you may take them in. You didn't even tell me before you decide this. What should I do? Buy a cell phone so that I can contact you. Lee Han Se, so now we are a team? Quite beautiful. He doesn't even have a book I can read. What? What are these? What are you doing? I want to go online. Do you know how expensive this computer is? Go to a side. Go to a side. How expensive can a computer be? You don't know anything, don't say nonsense. This is not a regular computer. it is for a professional. Only a professional may use. If you accidentally pressed the wrong keys and break the computer, with the situation your family is in right now, you won't be able to pay. What? Hurry up and go upstairs. How can you speak like that? You are so petty. I have to be petty. Do you know how expensive this thing is? If you think I am petty, then you should leave. Ahjumma! How can you yell at me that loudly? I know you are not mute. Treating me like this, you will regret it sooner or later. I'd like to know how I will regret it. Why did you come out from there? This is all because of Father. When are we going to America? When? We have to contact Sung Joon first. When is that? If we keep waiting, I'll die from anger. Then, carry my dead body there. Look. Look at your temper. Really. Ahjumma, where is Chauffeur Kang? Even in this situation you are still calling him Chauffeur Kang? Since I said it, I might as well say it clearly. Why did you take my honest husband to a night club? This ahjumma sure doesn't know her husband well. What? What do you mean? What do you mean, I don't know him well? Nothing. What is it? You have to explain it. I am just saying. If you have nothing better to do, don't say random stuff. Really. Father really isn't much. But the daughters are quite okay. Last night, I thought that my brain would explode because I was thinking so hard about this matter. God, why are you giving Park Kyung Soo such a hard task? Is Chauffeur Kang here? What Chauffeur Kang? This, this. Aigoo, really. Looks like you still don't know. Your president was my Chauffeur before he retired. Really, why are you talking about the past? What? I am a reasonable person, so I will let you go. Really, if it wasn't for your daughters, I would had hit you. Chauffeur Kang. No, you must have said many bad things about me behind my back. What? What exactly did you say? Your daughter-in-law and even that young fellow look down on me? No, what did those people do to young master? Nothing, nothing. I will have to let it go. After all, I am the one that is bothering your family. Calm down. I will make sure to tell them to be careful. No need, no need. I am going to leave here soon anyway. That way, it would decrease the burden on Chauffeur Kang. I don't mind. I am saying that my heart feels uneasy. My heart. Last night, I couldn't even sleep well. Living in my house must had made you soften up. I know, I know. I didn't get enough money, so I can't give my family a comfortable environment to relax. I feel so much guilt in my heart. So, can you buy our family's airplane ticket to America? What? It's not a lot of money. After you buy the airplane tickets, all the guilt in my heart will be gone. It's not a lot of money. Just 500,000 won. 500,000 won is enough. Young master. Don't tell me that you don't even have such a small amount of money. Once I see Sung Joon in America, I will immediately return the money to you. Why are you going to such a faraway place? Can't you start over here? I don't even have one cent. How can I start over? Chauffeur Kang, would you give me cash? That, young master... Don't say so much. Are you going to buy the plane tickets or not? You... What are you doing? Seo Jung Gil, prepare to die today. Every time I think about the night club matter, I get so mad that my teeth itches. Wait, wait, wait a moment. You, you, you think clearly first. Big thigh, big thigh. That day I saw clearly with my eyes, high thigh and pink lipstick. Let's kiss for a bit. You remember now? Don't have a grudge on me anymore, okay? So... Your wife thinks, you are not the perverted kind of husband. Want me tell her that you are not what she thinks you are. Why, Jung Gil? You know that whatever I, Seo Jung Gil, say, I will do. On the floor, my body feels so uncomfortable. I want to go to a sauna, how much do you have on you? Why would I have money? If I find any money, for every 100 won I would say "High thigh, high thigh" once. I really don't have any money on me. None, none. A woman struggling to survive, still have time to paint her nail. Sure knows how to be a woman. Since I am still living, a woman must be a woman. Your nails are like turtle shells. Your nails are so long that it can cut open the stomach of a fish. Why are you so angry? Did you grow these at home? No, right now. Right now what are you doing? Your daughter-in-law wants me to help do chores. No. When did I...? I got framed. I didn't, I really didn't. Go in and rest. She is my guest, did you forget? No, how can I? But, what is that? Are you coming back from somewhere? I feel too stiff from moving my body so much in the morning. I went to the sauna and came back. Our house is a bit small, isn't it? You should be comfortable while you stay there. If you ever feel uncomfortable, tell me about it. Hey, this kid is different from his parents. Really? Hey, if I didn't know better, I would've called you my kid. This kid's good looking too. What is all of this? You can put it on the breakfast table tomorrow morning Father. - I'm back! - Come in. Mom, have this. What is it? The guest asked for it before. Coffee and bread. Hyun Soo, you too? Have you ever bought me even a gum before? When I was sick in bed due to swollen glands in my neck, you didn't even buy me any icicles. Hey, be quiet! How come you aren't even as considerate as your child? Mom... Our family is treated like nothing. What is good for sacrificing myself for my family? Mom... Get out of here! Geez... Mom, if you do that, I'm going to get angry. What? Can't I cry? You know who makes me upset. Even though your grandfather acts like that, how could you do that? Mom... Frankly, have you ever bought me any cheap perfume on the way back from the states? I am not telling you this as though I expect something from you. I feel so sad that you don't think of me at all. I don't know why I should live this way, while I don't even get respected from my own child. Don't cry. Have you even checked the bag thoroughly yet? What? Check it again. What is this? Nothing expensive, but it's to protect your hands. What? Your hands are always wet to work for the house the whole day. Seeing your hands becoming dry and chipped makes me even more sad. I know that putting this on your hands won't make your hands soft right away but since your son bought it for you, you should use it at least, right? Hyun Soo! By the way, mom, don't get me wrong but I like your hands like this. I can see that my mom loves my family and me this much. Being born as your son makes me feel so proud and happy. Hyun Soo! Mom, I asked you not to cry! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Hyun Soo. I didn't know you cared about me this much. I'm sorry. Mom, you know? I love you the most in the world Mom. I love you the most in the world too! I don't need your father or grandfather. I only need you. I'll put this on my hand right away. Since my son bought this for me I will save this and use only a tiny bit at a time. No, no! Don't do that! Use a lot! If you finish it, I will buy you another one! I get you! I get you! How could I live without you! Don't do that Mom. Why? Don't do that. What shall I do? It can't be! No! What shall I do if I don't even have you? It's me I think you are a little bit late today... What? Why don't you come home? Why? Well, I know that it is nothing that I should care A woman should sleep at home at least... hello? Hello? Why? Why did the call cut off? When did you get here? A bit ago. Ahjumma doesn't know you're talking to a slapper, right? It's a friend, and male friend! I don't you not to call her 'slapper'. Oppa will get you, you know! I understand, I'm sorry, oppa. But Oppa's friend's phone seems to be breaking off. My sister's phone calls are also always dropped out. It's really frustrating. I can't ask her to get a new one due to our family's financial situation. I don't like my sister and she can make me feel upset. I guess it's the bloodline thing. Since how long was the phone dropping calls? It's been a long time. But what can we do. Even if I want to buy her one, I don't know one to borrow from. Hey, how much would it cost? While you're here, buy one for yourself too. I don't need one. Oh! You don't know the dating basics. Now a days, texting is the norm in dating. Just buy one, buy one. Don't go sneaking around your mom calling the slapper. That's right. If you get a couple's phone, you'll get a discount and charges are minimal. C.. Couple phones? If it's a couple phone, wouldn't your sister realize? Notice? Just get it! These are the latest models, right? Then I want... Then, if it's for Unni, let's get this one. It gets connected right away, right? That's right, what's your number? 01... Just any easy number's fine. Hey! You can't just make up a new number. My sister doesn't care for that stuff. She only gets calls from the hospital anyway. It's not like she has a secret boyfriend or anything. Come this way please. I'll send you the money as soon as we get to the US. Sure, don't worry about it. What's up with you? The person who says not to waste electricity. I'm just touched by a younger sister who's thinking of her older sister. Of course, it's fine. Where are you going? Let's go to her now. Oh, why would you go that far? Just give it to her at home. No, I have to. Let's go. Why? If we go home, you'll sit worried about your sister. Since when did you care so much for me? I'm going home. I can't let you be worried! Let's go! No, I'm not going! Ah, really! You could just give it to her at home. Call her, ask where she is. What if she's in the middle of an emergency procedure. Wait here. You're smarter than you look. Why are you following? What if rumors circulate that some man is looking for her at the hospital? I understand. I'll wait here! Ah, that dork. Excuse me, where can I find Dr. Seo. I'm her sister? Hang on a moment. Do you know where Dr. Seo is? Why do you bother asking? No doubt, she'll be in the director's research office. Please go to room 315. Okay. Hey, where are you...? Aishh... Third floor! Since I'm here already, I'll see her for two minutes. Oh, don't be like that! Seriously, please don't be like this. It's ending today. Go away, hurry. I'm doing anything. Where were we? I said, you can't do that. It's just one word. I'll do it. I will. Hey, you! Why did you suddenly run. Let's go home. You have to go to give the phone don't you. I already did. She said she was very thankful. Why? Do you need to see my sister? No... I'm hungry. Let's hurry up. Seo Jung Kyung. So, you think you're all that with guys, huh? Such a fake goody goody. That's not a normal relationship. What is this? So, Kang Hyun Soo is her blinded blundering love puppy? Hey, Jung Kyung. I went to the hospital and back and I'm disappointed that I didn't get to see your face. You'll get sick if you over work yourself. So, take it easy. Kang Hyun Soo. Poor guy. He doesn't know anything. I'm disappointed too. Also, thanks. With a h... h... heart! Hey! Where's Chauffeur Kang? Hey, Ahjusshi! In the auto shop, please call him 'president' okay? Hey, Kang Sang Hoon! Hey, watch your tongue in front of elders. Why are you being like this? Chauffeur Kang, Chauffeur Kang... You! Know your place! Hey, now that you understand order, behave yourself from now on. Okay? Chauffeur Kang! Oh, hello. Chauffeur Kang, did you prepare what I asked for you yesterday? Yes... Young master, how about reconsidering doing this? Why are you like this? If you're going to give, give big! What's this? Are these tickets from a mileage reward program? Airplane tickets? Are you telling us to fly to the US on redeemed miles? The seats are the same anyway. I thought there'd be no difference. What do you mean, 'there's no difference'. I'm going to the US to start my life again. Are you telling me to restart like a free-loading by sending me off on redeemed miles? Geez... the way you handle things. Then, I'll cancel these. It's fine! You miser... Oh my goodness, why do you just take this? Would you rather me had a go and just? Oh wow, I just applied the lotion once and my hands look great. Oh, my. If you use your bare hands you'll damage them. They're already rough as is. Aigoo! I guess you're more oblivious than I thought. Do you see anything different? Sorry? You see, my son bought some hand cream for me. You have a son too, right? Have you received one from your son? I don't need that since I've no need to get my hands wet. Oh... so you haven't! Then again, he hasn't called even with his family like this. Why are you doing this to me? Do you dislike me that much? Then, do you think you'd be lovable to me? Hey, honey. - Honey - What? When are we going to the States. She keeps picking fights with me here and there. I'm scared. Wha... what? What are you scared of? Am I a ghost? You look more scary than I do. As a man, I am too a little scared of you, ahjumma. You! Pack your bags. Let's go. To the hotel. What money do we have for that? Here, here. What are these? I ask for some plane tickets. And, the old fool really got them for me. So, I traded the miles for some cash. What money does grandpa have that you stick him? As soon as we find Sung Joon in the US, I'm going to repay him with interest even. Yes, yes, let's go now. Leave now? Yes, of course. Let's leave immediately. Jung Kyung, it's me. Yes. Let's leave right now. Mom, dad, just a moment. Why? The phone disconnected. Can you talk for a moment? No. Is it not a good time to talk? Yes. Sorry, I just finished my lecture. If you're able to go home together, call me. I'll be waiting. Oh, this dork! Is something going on? I almost dropped my patient's liver. Text next time. Text! Oh! Such bad timing. I understand. Next time, for sure... sure... sure... Hey, there are no double letters here. You're here. Yeah. You bought something for them again. Yes. This is meat. Barbeque it. Meat? Father... you're too much. What? When our Hyun Soo returned after 2 years away from home, you wouldn't allow us to eat meat saying it was unhealthy. How can the young master's family be more important than your only grandson? They're leaving tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yes, it's their last meal. Serve them well. Yes, Sure, I'll do my best, father. Oh, young master! Where are you going? Ah yes. I was talking to a friend in the hotel business. We'll stay there before we leave for the States. And, wouldn't it be better for you if we vacate sooner than later? Let's go. Grandfather... going to America is good, but the fact that I won't be able to see grandfather anymore makes me sad. Grandfather you have to stay healthy. I'm back. Young master, you must have dinner before you leave. Are they going somewhere? They're going to a hotel. Right now? I know, you should stay for a meal together. Because father likes agasshi, he bought meat. It's not like we've never eaten meat before. Let's go. I want to go after eating. Who knows when I'll be able to see grandfather again. Young Master. Yes, please eat and then go. Really now! You're bothering up to the very last minute. Our spread here isn't much. But my daughter-in-law has put forth much of effort for you. You should've just eaten yourselves. I don't see much I can eat here. Hurry, let's just eat and go. Is that true? Honey, what are you doing? They're burning. Hey, hey. My wife prepared these for you. Since it's your last meal here, eat up lots. We might not see you again once you're gone away far across the ocean. Look at you, so stupid. The United States isn't the moon or something. We're coming right back with the money when we get in touch with Sung Joon. Hey, hey, have you even rode on a plane before? Fine. Say all you want to say before leaving for the states, okay? Really? Then can I talk about this too? What are you talking about? Hey, hey Jung Gil, have some of this and this. Eat this too. Alright, alright. I'll eat. Here, feed me that. Since it's our last meal. Let it be. Delicious, right? Grandfather, come join us too. I'm fine. Eat all. You eat too. Aigoo... Eat up. Grandfather, you have to stay healthy until we meet up again. Sit down. Don't worry about our father, worry about yourself. They carry guns in the States. Don't go spastic all over the place there. To be honest, you're a little sad that we're leaving, right? A little regretful that you should've treated us better too, huh? Hey, where are you going? Huh? If someone comes, they might not know we're all out here. Are you worried about Kyung Soo? He's not coming. He went to a reunion. Really? Unni isn't here yet. Well, Jung Kyung will call if she can't find us. Hey hey... Here's some meat. Eat up. The smell is nauseating me. Honey, I want to drink some coffee. Coffee? I'll get it for you. Hey, Hyun Soo! Hyun Soo! Oh so tough. Hey, Sang Hoon, for this beef, do you have any liquor? No, I'll get it. Huh? I'm going. So tough. You should just go home rather than to your friend's place. That's why I said I'd get a cab. What if you lie to me and go somewhere else. Are you doubting me now? Sure, I'm a man too. Man? Oh, now that I'm looking, you do have facial hair. Let's go somewhere to have dinner. Meet your friend tomorrow. I'd like to. But we're almost here anyway. You can drop me off over the hill. Alright. I'm out of breath walking over this hill. Why did you tag along? Such a nuisance. You're overjoyed that I'm going to the US, right? How did you know? It's as freeing as getting rid of bad bowel movement. What? And, I'm saying this for your good. Work on your temper when you get to the US. You can't shout at just anyone. And, you're in big trouble if you're sprawled drunk on the streets somewhere. Do you even know how to speak English? And what if someone abducts you while you're plopped sitting in the middle of the streets crying? So, two-timing in plain sight. What? Are you going somewhere? Oh, when did you get here? Miss? Who's that? Who? That car? A car? You don't need to know. It looks like you two were going somewhere. I'll go first then. We're not going somewhere together. I came to get some coffee. And why did you come? Anyway, we were each headed in a different direction. But, your mother didn't tell me what kind of coffee... Espresso? Cafe latte? Look at how he's asking you. Why don't you go with him to pick which. Here, I'll carry that for you. It's okay. You're sad that all your family is going to the US, right? Yes. But since you have the phone. You can talk to them often. Right? I suppose. That's what I'm talking about. Live entertainment becomes boring. But, where are you planning to stay after your family leaves? - At the hospital? - The hospital? It'll be too uncomfortable there. We'll have a room available anyway. Why don't you stay in that room? Unni, if you use that room, you might not come out of there alive, even your bones. No, that's not true. We're planning to rent the room out anyway. Last time I went there, Ahjumma almost beat me to death. Today, since we're leaving, she's so excited that she's barbecuing and all in a tizzy. Just to think if you were the only one to remain. Think of all the frustration you would feel. My mother isn't like that... She is so like that. I know my mother better than... No. I'm grateful for your words, but I don't want to be an inconvenience for you any longer. Let's go, Jung In. Umm.. Now that I'm seeing this, you are way too friendly. Wow... really... At least, I still have the cell phone. Why is it taking them so long? Sang Hoon... just make a quick run and get some. Huh? Uhm... the meat. Alright, I'll... What's the matter with you honey. They're our guests. Hey, Jung Gil. Since this is your last time, say all except the thighs. Tell me if there's anything you need. Sang Hoon. Now or years ago, still has the heart for people. It was when you were living in the back house right? Was that in high school? I didn't even ask him. But, he mowed the lawn. Washed the cars. In his young mind, he probably wanted to help his father. It wasn't that. He needed money to go on a date with a girl. A girl? When did I? It's all in the past. It's fine. You even went to church for that girl, huh? You even went to church for her? No, it's not like that. Oh, this dude! One who used to sling the bicycle chains around, had a Bible tucked under his arms. You went so diligently. I thought you were going to become a minister. What are you talking about? Are you drunk without having even to go around. [WHISPERING] Just give me a second, I'll be right there. I believe April is next. Excuse me. I thought I was the one you wanted to spend the rest of your life with. So did I. Wow. Crazy times, huh? I tell you, it's a good thing you kicked my ass to the curb that final time. I mean, it's taken a shit load of curves, but I think I finally got the message. I'm sorry about that. It was shitty. And I don't have an excuse other than I was obsessed with Christian. But I don't feel that way, and you're so good to me and we're good together, and I just... I really, in my heart, feel that two people that are right for each other need to spend the rest of their lives together. Honey, I've got more bumps and bruises than a rodeo clown. I can handle the pain, but after a while you just get tired of being laughed at. [SIGHS] Listen do me a favor, will you, Kimber? I've got a Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 1986 over at the bar. Would be a sweetie and go get it? [WOMEN LAUGH] And bring a corkscrew. MIKE: Hey. Kimber, the wine? Not yet. I'm planning to take him to his favorite strip club and drop the bomb there, let naked women soften the blow. Uh... No, not anymore. He kicked his wife out. Listen, Curtis, I was thinking we could author an article together based on this trip. I have an idea for a new procedure on patients with neurofibromatosis. Great. Okay. Yeah. We'll talk about it when I see you in a few days. Ah. I gotta go. Okay, bye. What? [SIGHS] Kimber fell off a boat last night. She's... She's missing. What? Whose boat? Mike's. Coast Guard thinks she... Thinks she's dead. Wait, I don't understand what happened. She... She slipped and fell off the boat? - Mike thinks she jumped. - Jumped? Yeah. Suicide? But the Coast Guard is still searching, so they could still find her. Well, it's been 12 hours and you can't survive in the water that long, you know? [SCOFFS] I kicked her out last night. [VOICE BREAKING] I told her I wanted her out of my life. [EXHALES] I should have... [MUTTERS] [SOBBING] I don't know what to do. There you are. Dr. McNamara? I wanted to thank you and Dr. Troy for the excellent care I've received here. - Is he around? - No, he's... You look like you're healing well, Mr. Seabrook. I feel great. Today really is the first day of the rest of my life. I'm not gonna let a day pass doing things I don't wanna do or feeling ways I don't wanna feel. Good for you. I wish you luck with everything. Hope the same for you, Dr. McNamara. All right. Goodbye. [ENGLISH SDH] Previously on nip/tuck... Why are you with me, Christian? You think I'm stupid. You hate yourself like I do. I always go back to you because you hate me the best. Will you marry me? Christian loves you, and he is faithful to you. I don't know who he is. I don't know who I am. We're bad. Like, this is really bad. Heck if I don't feel guilty. Curtis? I got to tell you, I was a little shocked when I heard you won the Poland award. We're lucky, though, you know, Sean? Most poor bastards, they never get to find out what their true purpose in life is. Usually, we ask our new clients what they don't like about themselves, but in this case, I think we can figure it out. What happened? Car accident? Physics. 170 pound man falls 245 feet, quickly reaching a maximum velocity of 86 miles an hour before he hits the water 4 seconds later... which, I know, doesn't sound like a long time. But it's a frickin' eternity. And was this a suicide attempt? Yeah, at the most cliched spot on the planet... the golden Gate bridge. And you survived the fall. You... must be one in a million. Close. About 1,200 people have jumped from the bridge. Conservative estimate... the current's so strong there, they assume more than that have jumped without being seen, have been swept out to sea or taken by sharks. Only about 40 of us have lived to tell the tale. Why'd you do it? Uh, what my partner means is, we're going to need a complete psychological picture before we can agree to operate on you. I don't mind talking about it. I'm as sane as the next guy. My psychiatrist agrees. You ever try and kill yourself? No. Uh, what about you, Dr. Troy? You know, I've had, uh, rough patches, but I guess I've always been able to... find pleasure in my life somehow. Well, that's lucky. Yeah. I guess I'm just kind of a naturally depressive personality. I guess, obvious. Just... life's just been kind of hard for a while. My son died of leukemia. He was 14 years old. You know, marriages don't survive that kind of thing. I just felt this kind of darkness building up inside me. The edges of it disappeared, and it felt like it kind of swallowed me up. Wasn't even painful anymore. Everything just was so hard. Except jumping. Jumping was easy. I remember, I didn't want anybody to see me go over the rail... like I didn't want to get in trouble somehow. And I went over the rail, and there's a lip, and I stood there, and then, I just stepped... I mean, the way, you know, you step out of bed in the morning, I stepped. And I thought to my self, "no, not this. Go back. Stop. Go back!" By second 2, I knew I wanted to live. I've never been so sure of anything in my life. What did you do? Um, well, most of the people who've survived landed feet first. So I somehow managed to flip myself over and hit the water like a blade of grass. And it still felt like a cinderblock to the balls, though. Broke 2 vertebrae in my pelvis and, you know, obviously, the reason I'm here. Broke all 14 bones in your face, but your jaw is remarkably intact. Uh, Mr. Seabrook, we may not be able to make you look the way you looked before. I don't care about that. I just want to look normal. Jumping gave me a second chance to live my life, to follow my dreams. I want to go back to school, maybe become a therapist, start dating again. You know, maybe, uh... Maybe have another kid. You must be in a lot of pain. You know how they say when you die, your life flashes before your eyes? It's not true. You don't see all the things you've done. You see all the things you're never going to get a chance to do, all the opportunities you're going to lose. I didn't jump to my death. I jumped to my life. I just need you to help me to live it. Oh. Baby, that feels so good. Ok. Come inside me. Well... Aren't you... No. I mean, no. I'm good. I don't need to. You do it. Come on. Oh! Oh, oh, my gosh, Sean! Oh! Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God. That was insane. Mmm. That was weird. Why? I'm not used to you not coming. I don't always need to come. Well... I do. Mmm. Honey, we're married. We have, like, a lifetime of orgasms ahead of us. We're good. It's good. Oh. Mmm. Why stay with him? Are you suggesting that you and i... No. I want to know. Why stay with him, if it makes you so unhappy? I don't know. The same reason you do, I guess. Kind of feel sorry for the guy, huh? Unlucky bastard. He survived a fall from the golden Gate bridge. How is that unlucky? He went from being depressed and suicidal to completely delusional in 700 feet. He really thinks he's going to change his life now. And you don't believe him. How many times have you sworn off drinking and then wake up with a hangover? Same thing, right? Having a hangover and attempting suicide are not the same thing. You would know, I guess. What's that supposed to mean? I'm just saying that people don't change just because they think they're going to die and then get a second chance. You had cancer. You thought you were going to die. You're saying that didn't give you the courage to look at life a little differently? For about a week, yeah, maybe. All right? I think there's no way you can't change after something like that. So tell me, how is your life so different since you swam out to the buoy? At a certain age, you just accept who you are and stop thinking there's something better out there. You're right. You haven't changed at all. You married Kimber, and you still screw around every chance you get. Which reminds me, I was having lunch at shutters the other day, picked up these 2 hot sisters who both want to go up 2 cup sizes. They're coming in on Thursday. Unbelievably hot, trust me. I told them that'd be cool. Is that cool with you? Why don't you finish up here? I forgot. I have a meeting i need to get to. We have a consult after this. Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mr. Wise. Uh, don't get the wrong idea. I wasn't trying to kill myself. Mr. Wise, the gash around your neck was clearly made by a belt, probably spiked, from the sharp indentations left at perfectly spaced intervals. The skin's been ripped and twisted. Not a surprising consequence when you try to hang yourself. Kudos, Sherlock. Spiked belt it was, although you haven't solved the case just yet. I wasn't trying to commit suicide. I was masturbating. Autoerotic asphyxiation. Gone awry. My bad. I just need you to fix this so that I can stop wearing scarves and turtlenecks when it's 80 degrees outside. I liked you better when i thought you tried to kill yourself. You risk dying for an orgasm? It wasn't just an orgasm, it was the orgasm of a lifetime. You have no idea. Cutting off the blood supply to the brain provides an amazing high. I do have an idea. It's better than any drug you've ever had... I've ever had. Includes quite an extensive list, I can tell you. Don't knock it if you ain't tried it, doc. Thanks, but, you know, I can usually find someone to help me out. Call it the perks of being married. Oh. Right. Been there. Divorced now. Look, all I'm saying is, you cut off the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain, your dick gets unbelievably hard. That's why these guys who are hung get these huge, stonking boners and ejaculate when they die. It's called induced... induced cerebral anoxia. I know. That's right. You get this euphoria. It's like having one foot in heaven. So, I take it you're going to continue with this practice even after i, uh, repair the damage to your neck? Don't worry, doc. I'll stick to silk ties from now on. Same high without the ring around the collar. Look, I'm asking you to fix this, not how I choose to come. Judge not, right? Excuse me. May I help you? Yeah. I'm looking for Dr. Ryerson. Is he expecting you? We spoke earlier on the phone. I'm Sean McNamara. Oh! Dr. Mcnamara. Yes. I'm nsolo. Curtis told me you were coming by. You and your partner were the other recipients of the other Poland award this year. Congratulations. Follow me, please. Hey! Sean, thanks for coming. Hey, how was your drive? Just fine. Good. Let me know if there's anything you need while in San Diego, anything at all. Thanks. Nsolo stepped on a land mine in Angola. He was a beggar at the airport when we met him, and now, he practically runs the entire center when I'm on the road, which is about 10 months out of the year. Well, I'm glad you were in town. I've been wanting to see your operation since we talked in Miami. Well, here it is, in all its glamour. Not exactly Beverly Hills, but... That's a good thing. So, uh... What's going on with Christian? Oh, he's still sucking the champagne and caviar out of life. After the ceremony, you guys took off so quickly, I thought maybe... sorry about that, Curtis. I had to jump on the next flight. There was an emergency back at the office. So... I cannot tell you how many trips I've had to cut short and hop on a plane. I remember once, crop duster came and picked us up on the serengeti on the way to a malaria outbreak in darfur. An angry herd of wildebeests chases us down the runway, I kid you not. Barely got out of there with our necks. Wow. The closest I've come to anything like that would be bumper-to-bumper on the 405 with Christian, who's in a bad mood 'cause he's late for his massage. That's why I called you. I'm here because... I want to help. So what can I do? Well, we are flying a 12-year-old girl in from Jakarta on Thursday. Her husband cut her in the face with a machete when she fought off his rape attempt. What we need is a surgeon and an o.r. Consider it done. You sure about this? I mean, maybe think about it, talk to Christian. No, I don't need to talk to Christian. Just something I want to do, something I probably should have done a long time ago. All right. Well, I'll set it up for Thursday. Great. This is really going to make a difference, Sean. What are you doing? I want to make my baby happy. If my baby's not happy, then I'm not happy. I'm half asleep... look, just tell me what you want. Anything. I want you... don't worry about me. I'm fine. You don't seem fine to me. Come on. Ahh. Mmm. Ohh. Yeah. Get it, baby. Oh. What are you doing? Oh, trust me. Trust me. Trust me. Trust me. Trust me, baby. You got to trust me, ok? You're going to have the come of your life, I promise. Ok. Trust me. Oh. Look at me. Look at me. You got to trust me. Oh. Ok? Ok. Oh. Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, my God. Yeah. Yeah. That's my baby. Next time, you do me, baby. Oh. Sorry, partner. I was performing a slipindicktomy. Are we in high school? You have to brag about having sex with your wife? We are not talking about sex, partner. I gave Kimmie the orgasm of her lifetime, ok? I mean, Kimmie's toes curled up like the wicked witch of the east, and it's all because of Mr. Wise in there. Seriously. I mean, we were having marital problems. The sex was all, you know, whatever. Anyway, I took his advice and tried erotic asphyxiation. You choked your wife? Ok, come on. It's not like I'm o.j. Or something, all right? I know how to deal with the pressure. I'm a doctor. Oh, you're right. That's very romantic. Trust me. Kimber loved it. Not as much as you did, though. What's that supposed to mean? Everything is about power for you. You're not satisfied unless you're dominating your partner. You live your life with your hand on her throat, might as well screw her that way, too, right? Jeez, what's up your ass today, huh? Kimber deserves better than this. You know, if you're having problems, why don't you try talking about it? Ok, Mr. Marriage counselor guy. Ok. You're giving me advice, right? Last time I checked, you've been divorced... how many times? Same as me, right? And since when do you care about Kimber so much? Guys, are you clean enough? The guy's been under for 6 minutes. Hey. Sean... Sean... no, no, no, no. No... don't talk. Don't talk. Ow. Mmm. Isn't that what you like now? No. Sean. Sean! Ugh! Sean, stop it! Jesus. Kimber... Hey, look. I know about the choking. He told me. I just want to know if you're ok. It's fine. It's not as bad as it looks. Oh. You should get somebody to look at that, you know? Sean, stop it. I really... i really don't want you to touch me right now, ok? I came here because we need to stop doing this. Ok. Ok? Just ok? What do you want me to say? "Stay, we can work it out"? Well, I would have thought maybe you'd have a little bit more feeling than that, or for me. It's never what this was about. You know that. Ok. Then I guess that's it. You're not going back to him, are you? He's my husband, Sean. You deserve better. I know. And the only reason why I haven't been able to get it is because I'm fooling around with his best friend, and I am just as much to blame for my own unhappiness as anybody. And if I'm going to get what I deserve, i need to take a little bit of responsibility, refocus on my marriage... even if that means being completely honest with him. How long you been going behind my back, you cheating bastard? I come in this morning expecting to be waist-deep in double Ds. Instead, I find my 2 bimbos out in the lobby trying to reschedule. Oh, cool your jets. We'll fit your bimbos in. And I promise, this operation won't cost you a Penny. Good to see you, Christian. I don't give a shit about the money. If you're operating on somebody who needs it, that's fine. There's a first. And... and what about him? I mean, where did he come from, huh? Last time we saw each other, you were too embarrassed to say good-bye, and now you're working together in our surgical suite. Curtis said he needed some help, and I jumped at the opportunity. And you just forgot to tell me. Frankly, I didn't think you'd care. Bullshit. You knew exactly what you were doing. Why don't you scrub in? You can help us with these grafts here. No, thank you, Curtis. I have no desire to be around Sean when he's got his tongue so far up your ass. Sorry about that. Guess you never got around to telling him you're going to be gone to Africa for a month, huh? Sorry to interrupt. We really do need to get a "do not disturb" sign on that door. You know, nurse Linda's come in a couple of times. She needs to take your vitals. That's fine. I'm through. You know, maybe you should go finish off in the bathroom. Really, it's not worth the effort. I've had farts that were more exciting. Why don't we take a look, huh? How's it look? Looks pretty good. Very good, in fact. How's the patient doing? Depressed. That's just the anesthesia wearing off. You'll be fine in a couple of days. Bullshit. I've been rubbing myself raw, fantasizing my ass off. Sex without asphyxiation is about as exciting as... a day without sunshine? Right. I forgot. You liked me better suicidal. Oh, no, no, no. I don't. I mean, I did, but... I don't. I've been having some trouble in my marriage, and I think you might have just... helped it. She was a little scared at first. Thought I was trying to choke her to death or something. And? It worked. It worked. Probably the greatest orgasm I've ever seen. I mean... And how was it when she did you? Blow your mind or what? No, no, no. I'm better at giving than receiving. Well, it depends what you're receiving. Believe me, if you want to discover your capacity for limitless ecstasy, go beyond what you ever thought possible, get her to return the favor. Your marriage will last forever. Well, I think the neck's coming along fine. As long as you stay off the windpipe for a couple of months, maybe forever, you'll be good. You know what it's like? To have experienced heaven, and now be denied entry? You know, I think I'll get you a couple of girl-on-girl action videos, so I'll talk to my anesthesiologist, get a recommendation. Hey, handsome. Hey, honey. I'm just going to jump on the treadmill before i get some dinner. Hey, not yet. Mm-hmm. What? Come over here. What? Sit. What are you doing? You look like a bitch in heat, Kimmie. Do i? Yeah. Well, I'm actually a tigress, and you are a tortoise. A tortoise? Mm-hmm. T'thas exciting. I've been reading the kama sutra book. You're not the only creative lover. Oh. I like creative, huh? Why don't you get me off like I got you off? Well, I'm not really into that sort of thing. Come on. Mm-mm. No? But I want you to lay back. Right here. Spread your legs. Mm. Oh. Oh. Give me your hands. Mmm. Come on. Come on. You're the tigress. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, Christian. Oh, that's so good. Oh. Oh! What are you doing? What? You don't come like that with me. That's... but I'm having an orgasm. You faked that. No, I did not. Yes, you did. Bullshit. Filthy old porn trash. Oh, thanks. I'm sorry. This is the only time I've done it, ok? I've never done it before. I promise. And why should I believe that, huh? I've never done that! Well, because I'm not really into the choking thing. It freaks me out. Well, why didn't you just tell me? Because I feel guilty. Guilty? What the hell for? I think that you have made the right decision. There's not much choice. It's peach or blueberry. I overheard Ryerson on his cell after you 2 worked on that girl the other day. You're going with him to Africa. I just want you to know, I think it's really great. I mean, I do hate you for leaving, but I do understand. And by the way, when the hell were you going to tell me? I mean, should I update my resume? It hasn't sunk in yet. What did Christian say? Haven't told him. Oh. Yet. Ah. Don't say anything, ok? You know, it's funny. After all these years of you changing people, and you being the one who needed it. Shithead was right. Feels like an orgasm everywhere... in my feet, shoulders. Oh, God. Going to come. Get up and take the belt off. Shit. I can't move. There's not enough... I can't feel... I can't breathe. Stand up and take the goddamn belt off. Get up. Get up! Christian? Christian? Jesus Christ Christian! No. Are you ok? Are you sure you don't want them to come? Did you try and kill yourself? What is it, the choking thing? Honey, if it is, I don't care. I'll do it. I'll do whatever you want. I'll be a slave, if you want. I don't want a slave. I didn't mean it like that. That's not what I meant. Yes, it is. I had this... Moment of clarity before I lost consciousness. You'll never make me happy. I... Can never love you enough. Oh, baby. You are not thinking clearly. You don't have enough oxygen in your brain. You don't know what you're saying. I've never felt so clear. Christian, we've hit a rough patch. You don't break up because of it. We said "for better or worse," remember? Yeah. I can't that part. Ok, look. This is my fault. It's my fault. I've been a bad wife, and I've done really bad things. But I'm so sorry, and I'll make it up to you. And i know that you'll love me again. Can you hear what you're saying? I'm not good for you. I'm meant to be alone. He kicked me out. That's it. It's over. He's done with me now. You've heard that before... How many hundreds of times? No, it's different this time. You should have seen the look on his face. We're like 2 strangers. I mean, the guy doesn't even like me. Good. He's doing you a favor, Kimber. It's a gift. But I don't want that kind of gift. I want one that includes him, one for us. I mean, he's where I belong. Not anymore. Maybe you never did, right? Maybe it was just your fear of not belonging anywhere that made you so stuck. Doesn't matter now. All that matters now is, what are you going to do? This is your opportunity, Kimber. Jump. Take the leap. Find out who you are without him telling you you're not good enough, pretty enough, smart enough. Do it before you get too old and you can't. I'm not like you, Sean. I don't hate Christian. And I certainly don't want to be him, either. Hey. Hey. What's the with bad mood? Well, I don't really enjoy hanging out with a bunch of Hollywood skanks. Oh, come on. They're nice girls, Kimber. You said we were going to be alone. You'll get your turn. There's more than enough Mike to go around. Ok. Just give me a second. I'll be right there. I believe April is next. Excuse me. I thought I was the one you wanted to spend the rest of your life with. So did I. Wow. Crazy times, huh? I'll tell you what. It's a good thing you kicked my ass to the curb that final time. I mean, it's taken a shitload of curbs, but I think I finally got the message. I'm sorry about that. It was shitty. And I don't have an excuse other than I was obsessed with Christian. But I don't feel that way. And you're so good to me, and we're good together, and I just... I really, in my heart, feel that 2 people that are right for each other need to spend the rest of their lives together. Honey, , I've got more bumps and bruises than a rodeo clown. I can handle the pain, but after a while, you just get tired of being laughed at. Listen... do me a favor, will you, Kimber? I've got a Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1986 over at the bar. Why don't you be a sweetie and go get it? And bring a corkscrew. Hey. Kimber? The wine? Finally got the message. I'm sorry about that. It was shitty. And I don't have an excuse other than I was obsessed with Christian. But I don't feel that way. And you're so good to me, and we're good together, and I just... I really, in my heart, feel that 2 people that are right for each other need to spend the rest of their life together. Hey there. The wine? Not yet. I plan to take him to his favorite strip club and drop the bomb there, let naked women soften the blow. Uh, no. Not anymore. He kicked his wife out. Listen, Curtis, I was thinking we could author an article together based on this trip. I have an idea for a new procedure on patients with neurofibromatosis. Great. Ok. Yeah. Well, we'll talk about it when I see you in a few days. Ah. I got to go. Ok. Bye. What? Kimber fell off a boat last night. She's, uh... She's missing. What? Whose boat? See you in a few days. Ah. I got to go. Ok. Bye. What? Kimber fell off a boat last night. She's, uh... coast guard thinks she, uh... thinks she's dead. Wait. I... I don't understand what happened. She... She slipped and fell off the boat? I think she jumped. Jumped? Yeah. Suicide? Well, but the coast guard is still searching, so they could still find her. Impossible. 12 hours? Can't survive in the water that long, you know. I kicked her out last night. I told her I wanted her out of my life. I shouldn't have... I should have... I don't know what to do. There you are. Hey, Dr. Mcnamara, I wanted to thank you and Dr. Troy for the excellent care I've received here. Is he around? No. He's... uh... You look like you're healing well, Mr. Seabrook. I feel great. Today really is the first day of the rest of my life, and I'm not going to let another day pass doing things i don't want to do or feeling ways I don't want to feel. Good for you. I wish you luck with everything. Hope the same for you, Dr. Mcnamara. Goodbye. Blending in. You have no idea what ir's like always blending in. You forget who you are. Eventually, you start to forget who you ever were. They push you and push you further into the margins. Treat you like dirt. Take away your manhood. Make you small. Somebody had to do something about it. I hear you, Hollis. I really do. He used you, took advantage of your work, and cut you loose. It's a terrible thing. But I got people to answer to and they're already talking about kicking down doors. Look, since I don't think either one of us want to go down that road just yet, help me buy some time, send out the employees. No. No. That-that won't work. Let me finish. The deal is I get the bystanders, you keep Ken Lydecker. He's the only one you really want anyway. You'll still have leverage and I'll have something my bosses. We'll all get to live a little while longer. Human Target 1x01 Pilot Original Air Date on January 17, 2010 Sync, corrected by elderman - for addic7ed. com - All right. Everybody but Lydecker out. Let's go. Move. this way. This way. Keep moving. This way. Hey, buddy, we alone yet? Shut up, I'm- I take that for "yes. " 'scuse me. Are you Ken Lydecker? Yeah. Well, if you're out here, who's that inside? Whew. Where's Lydecker? Just give it a minute. You'll figure it out. I've seen you. You've been around here. You're the auditor. Not really. Listen, word of advice, never make threats. You want to do something, don't talk about it. Do it. What? Lydecker. You've been sending him threats for weeks. Got him planning. Got his guard up. Now look where you are. Threats just make things messier. No more threats. Just action. You just committed suicide for that snake, That rat. You realize that? Okay. Well, first of all, I don't think you can be both of those things at the same time. Second, you were a salesman. You got fired. Let's not do this like he had you working a chain gang. He took out eight years of my life. Left me with nothing. No severance. No savings. He broke me. And he deserves to die for it. No, he doesn't. Yes, he does. No, he doesn't! Nobody deserves to die. And frankly, after seeing your behavior this afternoon, I think Lydecker deserves a medal for putting up with you for as long as he did. What are you doing? I'm gonna take the gun away from you. Guns are dangerous. They're not for messing around. You think I'm messing around? I think we've been here for, what, six and a half hours? I'm tired. I missed lunch. Enough already. Are you crazy? Am I crazy? I'm assuming that was a rhetorical question. You don't want to go out like this, do you? No. So I'm gonna go outside. I'm gonna get as close to Lydecker as I can. And then I'm gonna finish what I started. And you can stand there and say whatever you want. That I'm about to do a terrible thing. That I can still get out of this. But it's not gonna change anything. This is still gonna happen. Hollis, what'd I tell you? No threats. Hello, Carmine. So how's your buddy today? Happy to be home. Morning, Winston. Checking up on me? Why, did something happen? I could care less about you. Who do you think's been feeding that beast the whole time that you've been laid up? I don't know. Figured you finally got a hold of the mailman. He's been eating him. Lydecker sent payment. This? Oh. Oh. Whiskey? It's not whiskey. It's a 25-year-old bottle of Takagi. That's $900 a pop. You know, when I suggested that we can keep transactions quiet by bartering instead of cash, I assumed you knew that I meant bartering for things of significant value. That stuff's not easy to come by. You hold onto it for ten years, it'll be worth ten times as much. Oh, so it's an investment. Exactly. Mm. You know, a guy who blows up the building he's standing in, you don't think him a long-term investor. We're still having this conversation? Really? I told you it was the only way to stop the guy from killing Lydecker and dozens of bystanders. Yeah, so you've said. However, What I'm trying to figure out is how the whole thing even got that far. Why not challenge him at the outset? You said the guy didn't arm the vest until late in the game. Why not disarm him cleanly beforehand? So you think I let it get that far 'cause I thought it'd be fun? I don't know. Why don't you tell me. Why don't you just ask me what you want to ask me. Are you slipping? I waited because I felt Lydecker was in no immediate danger. Do you really think that I would've pulled the trigger if I didn't know there was a bearing wall six feet away? If I didn't know that homemade fuse was gonna have at least a three-second delay? Where are you headed? I'm going to see Peale's got a referral for us. I can come. Ha ha. No. No, you can't. No. See, you can't 'cause the shop's closed. And it stays closed until you recover. No discussion. Thanks for worrying. But there's nothing to worry about. It was about a week ago. I get in the car to go to work and it won't start. Two hours later, I'm at the dealership and the mechanic comes out with this look on his face. He says "good news is your battery's dead. " Bad news is he found eight ounces of primasheet 2000 under the hood. Plastic explosive. I don't know why anyone would want me dead. I've never gotten threats. Don't have any enemies. I don't know what this is. That's why I need your help. And the police refused to grant protection? You know the deal with the department. Captain gave me two men, no overtime. Given the situation, it ain't hardly enough. The situation? What situation? Tell him what you do. I work for McNamara Engineering. I run the design team for the Monterey line. The California Bullet Train. You're looking at the lady responsible for the most expensive public works project in U.S. history. The last thing McNamara needs right now is more controversy surrounding the project. But I'm not here speaking for the company. I'm here cause she's my wife. With the train's maiden voyage coming up tomorrow, you can understand why we want to keep this information private. If you can help end this thing faster and safer than the police can, then you're the man we want. All right, well, um, We're not taking any new clients on at the moment. But, uh, I can refer you to another sec - no. I was told that you provide a unique service. That you're the people that I need. Why me? You can flush this person out, yes? Get him to reveal himself and take him out? I work with a cover. Blend into the background. Let you appear vulnerable so the threat reveals itself. And then eliminate the threat. I don't want to live my life in fear. Whoever's behind this shouldn't have that kind of power over me. How fast does this train go? Safe cruising speed is about 200 miles per hour. Would I get to ride on it? I assume so. Okay. I'm in. Let's go over the cover again. Who am I? You're Tony Graham, my new translator. Good. What happened to your old translator? the company provided one to deal with our Tokyo financiers, but she made too many mistakes so I hired my own. While we're on the subject, You are fluent in Japanese, right? Guess we'll find out, won't we? Mr. Situ wishes you congratulations on a well-deserved celebration and says that he's honored to be invited. Thank you. I'm so glad you could be here. What? They're our biggest investors. What did you just say? Oh, he wanted to know how I recognized that his dialect was satsuma-ben. Told him my grandfather was stationed in Tokyo. After the war, dated a steward from a small fishing village on the island of Kyushu. My grandfather sponsored him when he came to the U.S. for college. Became a friend of the family and he taught me Japanese. Wow, that's-is that true? No. Do you really think whoever's after me is gonna be on this train? Three hours in a confined space with no escape, no apparent security. This is where he makes his next move. Then why are you letting me on it? Because there's no escape for him either. When he moves, I'll be standing right next to you. In three hours, one way or the other, this thing is going to be over. When my father started this company, I doubt he'd have thought the state of California Could ever accomplish something like this. But in three hours, we'll be in L.A. Nothing will ever be the same again. And it's all because of you. So here's to you. Don't sweat what everybody says about her. I'm sure you'll enjoy working for her. What does everybody say about her? Well, that she's miserable to work for. That if you're not as smart as she is, you must be incompetent. That mistakes should be punishable by death. So it isn't true. No, it's true. So if she's so difficult, why does anyone put up with working with her? The truth? James. He protects her from everybody. Even McNamara. Ah, speak of the devil. I was, uh, just telling Tony here how everybody hates you- except for me, of course. Tom was James' best man. He introduced us. He's McNamara's general counsel. You'll have to excuse me. Our Undersecretary for Mass Transit insists on bugging me about the tab for today. So what was the tab for all this? All in? About $80 billion. How much of this came out of my taxes? About $62 billion. Even I want to kill you just a little bit right now. Well, it sounds like she's got enemies. Line forms the left. If there aren't at least ten people on this train that want her dead, I'd be amazed. Listen, see if you can pull the call logs on this phone. You know what, just out of curiosity, does she know you're on her phone? No. I swiped it. I want to see if she's talking to anybody interesting. I want to go 12 rounds with her on it. And another thing, see if you can find Guerrero. Let's bring him in on this. Oh, yeah, sure. Why not? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute now. You're not serious, are you? No one handles this corporate crap like he does. Do you really think you can trust that animal? Sure. As long as we pay him on time. Oh, get a load of this. I'm watching a guy who won't stop shifting his coat. She thinks I'm flirting with her. Anyway, see if you can pull the call logs. I'll keep trying to figure out how she got herself into this mess. Let me know when you find Guerrero. Oh, yeah. ♪ soldier boy ♪ ♪ oh, my little soldier boy ♪ You the guy who been digging around Soucha's Bank, asking questions, making trouble? And you're employees of the bank? You could say that. Well, I'm-I'm sorry, but your employer's involved with some pretty shady loans with this director's families. And my friends need to know just how shady if they're gonna make their case. So... afraid we're at an impasse. We're at a what? Impasse. It means we disagree without prospect of resolution. You know, we came here to explain it to you, but you don't seem to be getting it. Maybe the three of us can take a little walk out back to the alley. We can explain it a little better so there's no impasse.  I got to warn you guys, if this gets violent, I'm gonna fight back. You think you're gonna fight back? All right, maybe fight back's a little misleading. I'll take the beating 'cause that's all you two amateurs are cleared to do. And then one night soon, I'm gonna break into your houses and kill each of you in your sleep. Probably start with you, Alfredo. That way Steven here can have a few extra days with Marla and the girls. It's only fair. How do you know my name? Your employer keeps sensitive information on a drive he thinks is secure. It isn't. Shall we? This is Guerrero. Funny, my phone has the same ring. Yeah, go ahead. Guerrero is in. But listen, I went through her call logs. I found something here that could be pretty interesting. It's strange, don't you think, that we both have the same... Wait a second. That is my phone. Okay. Let me know what you find. You stole my phone. Do you know a times reporter named Mark Hoffer? He covers the project. He'd call me for a background or a quote. Why? Well, his name's not in your contact list, but his number shows up as incoming at least a dozen times, mostly unreturned. Well, I'm bad at returning calls. I haven't spoken to him in almost a year. What difference does it make? Hello? We've never met, but I think you know who I am. My name's Bill Arnold. I think you know what I've been saying about you in Sacramento. But now that I see what you've created, now that it's real, I think the first thing I need to say to you is I'm sorry. Evidently, you were worthy every penny. 'scuse me. We were having a conversation. Wait a minute. Just sit down. Keep your mouth shut. What's going on? The ice in your glass, it's cubed and no one else's are. Oh, my gosh. What happened? We need a doctor! Is there a doctor here? We need a doctor. Well, I rigged the door downstairs. that ought to give us a little bit of warning in case somebody comes looking for you. This was the plan. Flush him out. Get him to commit. Look at me. You trust me? So what do we do now? Well, he's irritated he's got to come to us. We let him make that mistake. Whoa! Son of a bitch. Hey. I need some information on a guy that works in your office. And you couldn't use a phone? Where's the fun in that? It's been a rough day. Let's just cut to the chase. Who's the guy? Mark Hoffer. Sacramento desk. Is that supposed to be a joke? Was it funny? You saying you don't know? Yeah. When? No such thing as a coincidence. Okay, keep digging. Mark Hoffer was killed this morning. With a car bomb. Same explosive as the one used in your car. Oh, my God. There has to be some sort of connection here. Now what is it? Uh, uh, about a year ago, he wrote a piece exposing corner cutting within the project. Hoffer got this information from an anonymous source within the company. Any Chance that anonymous source is sitting at the table with me right now? The cost cutting was jeopardizing safety measures. I kept telling them that a train this big and this fast had to be flawless, but they stopped listening to me. I had to do something. After that, McNamara got scared. He gave me everything I wanted. What else aren't you telling me? Nothing. Well, I don't buy it. People who get themselves in your kind of trouble are usually holding something back. Either it's pride, or they're embarrassed, or they're just stupid, so which one are you? You telling me I deserve this? Nobody deserves this. I'm just saying people have secrets. Secrets are dangerous. So what are you keeping from me? Do you hear that? Hear what? The brakes. They're squealing. So? This isn't a trolley car. If the brakes are squealing, something's wrong. So much for the flawless train. It is flawless. Get down. Tom. Let him go. Let him go. What the hell is going on back here? It's all right. It's all right? Bill's up there hanging on by a thread. It's a coin toss whether he makes it to L.A. alive. And then this guy drags you back here. He didn't drag me back here. W- wait a minute. It's complicated, but I'm okay. Then why did you pull all those emergency brake handles in the last car? What are you talking about? Tom, just go back downstairs. If anybody asks if you saw Stephanie, you say no. Stephanie, I'm your friend. You can trust me. Go. Hey, dude. Breaking and entering is a crime, you know. Yeah, it's good to see you too, Winston. It's been awhile. Oh, not long enough. What are you doing in my office? And what the hell are you doing on my computer? I'm checking out the contents of Mark Hoffer's hard drive. There's not much here. It's mostly personal. Do I want to know how you came about it? Editor at the paper owes me. Couple years ago, a gas company hired a guy to hassle him over a story he's working. Got nasty. I got him out of it. How? I decided to stop hassling him. Listen, you, don't get comfortable here. Because as soon as this case is done, you're gone. Spent too much of your life in an office, Winston. Look at you. It's made you weak. Yeah. No surprise, but I think McNamara management might be involved in this. That's good news. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. All right, cool. I'll, uh, I'll go pay him a visit. Well, how is that good news? Companies like this aren't built to off people, Winston. Tends to get sloppy. Someone talks, the wrong guys listen, and suddenly word's all over the street. Wait, who are you going to see? The wrong guy. Hate him. if Tom was right about these emergency brake handles, we might have a problem. The killer thinks you identified him, right? He's afraid he's caught so he wants to get off the train. He pulls one emergency brake. It doesn't work, so then he pulls them all. Well, that's what we want. He's panicking. He's getting that much closer to making a mistake. He already did. I think he blew out our brakes. Come again? The emergency brake system is complicated. Physical brakes combined with a magnetic system that's controlled by the computer. Problem is, the emergency brakes in the unfinished cars aren't tied into the computer yet. So when our guy kept engaging the disks, it must've overwhelmed the safety. So what are you saying? It's like going 100 miles an hour on the freeway with your foot on the gas and the emergency brake on. If we engage them again, they're gonna explode. I'm sorry, did you say explode? Yeah. It gets worse. There's a curve in the R-2 tunnel about 70 miles ahead. We need the brakes to slow down or we'll derail. If we do hit the brakes, and they blow up, they're gonna take the wheels with them and then we'll derail. 70 miles, that's, like, 20 minutes. Less. We need to warn everyone up front or a lot of people are going to die. Get ready to move. We should call up front, let them know what's going on. How did you-? Where's your phone? A vest? You wore a vest? Where's my vest? I'm your vest. Where's your phone? Back there. What about the intercom? Don't tell me. It's not hooked up yet. How you doing? Haven't seen you around for a while. Haven't been looking for you. Answer for everything. That's why I stopped finding work for you. You didn't know if you've heard of any work put on the street by a company called McNamara Engineering? Not to the best of our recollection. You sure? Hang on. I'll check again. Yeah. I'm sure. What do you care for anyway? You want to know if there's open work, but you don't want to take it. What, are you window-shopping? I see. You've gone over to the other side. You're fighting the good fight, making the world safe for democracy like your friend Chance. Word of advice, Give it up. Maybe it works for him, but not for somebody like you. Just making life hard on yourself, my friend. Companies have secrets. Husbands hate wives. Brothers envy brothers. What'd you just say? You want me to write it down for you? No. I got it. That's the- shh! What's the matter with you? If he hears us, we're gonna be dodging bullets. That's the grate to the next car. You can just unscrew it. We're running out of time. Hurry. Hi. Excuse me. In less than ten minutes, there's a very good Chance that this train is going to crash. I suggest that we get off it. I told you. I'm the interpreter. We need to get off this train. Off the train? You sound like a crazy person. What are you talking about? In a few minutes, we're gonna engage the brakes to take the R-2 tunnel curve. The problem is the disks are overheated. Once we engage them, the disks are gonna explode right out of their housing. This train is gonna go into the tunnel and it's not gonna come out. All right, uh, let's everyone take a breath here. This train is perfectly safe. Its brakes are perfectly safe. Damn it. Listen to me! Stephanie, we're only 18 miles out. Brakes engaged a few minutes ago. Now look, you disappear, you come back here, you're making a scene, you're getting everybody upset. Shh. Shh. Shut down the brakes. Shut them down now. There's a name for the kind of train this just turned into. How did this happen? It's a long story. I'll explain after we get everybody off the train. We're going 220 miles per hour. No one is gonna get off of this train. Run brake assist. There's a supplemental braking system in the rear car. It's too weak to slow the entire train at this speed. But if we separate the car, we can slow it down before it hits the curve. Okay. Okay. Let's get moving. Everyone to the back of the train. What the hell happened back there? He eliminated the threat. Did you recognize him? There's not much left of him. But there's enough to start digging into who hired him. Well, look who found the front door. Still got the call logs from the client's cell phone. Yeah. Good. Read me back the incoming calls from Mark Hoffer. I don't work for you. The dates and times, please. Um, August 20, 53 pm. April 24, 7:31 pm. February 25- What is this? Get Chance on the phone. The system isn't online. We'll have to cut the hydraulics manually. Is there time? We're fine. Once I disconnect the hoses, cars won't separate until the rear car hits its brakes. Why don't you let somebody else do that? I know the guts of this thing better than anyone. It's okay. I'll be okay. Go. Go. I'm sorry. For what? All this. I figure somebody should say it. Well, at least I know what I'll be doing Monday morning. What's that? Building the damn thing all over again. Is everyone onboard? Is everybody here? Yeah. Everyone's here. Hit the brakes. Down to the last connection here. Ready? I thought you said these don't lock. They don't. No. No. How much time? About two minutes to the tunnel. Maybe we could strap ourselves in. Hope the cars hold together. Will they? We're gonna die, aren't we? At this speed, the wake turbulence passing off the tail of the train, it's gonna run just north of level, right? Excuse me. The wake, the turbulence, the wind coming off the back. Yeah. There'd be a bit of an updraft. About 160, 170 degrees? Roughly. How did you know that? Lucky guess. Cut two of those seatbelts as close to the seat as you can. Wait a minute. No, no, no, no. What are you afraid of? Dying. It's not gonna happen. Come on. This'll be fun. This isn't gonna work. I'm open to suggestions. Here. Put this on. Exhale. Hard. Can't believe it's over. It's not exactly over. Be kind of nice to find out who's behind all this, don't you think? Well, at least it's over for a little bit, right? We'd like to thank you for everything. But I think after all this, it might be nice to go home, be alone tonight, just the two of us. Okay. Thank you. Hello. I just finished looking at the expense reports of a reporter by the name of Mark Hoffer. Who is this? They include a number of expenses at a hotel in Laguna. These stays coincided with phone calls placed by him to Stephanie's cell phone. When did you find out your wife was sleeping with Mark Hoffer? Forgot your tie. See, I had a hunch it wasn't the assassin who tried to stop the train and escape. It just didn't fit. It was you, wasn't it? And once your guy missed with the ice cubes, you figured things might be getting a little bit out of control. You're afraid that if I caught him, he'd finger you, and everybody on the train would know that you hired him to try to kill your wife. It was you? Because of me and Mark? It was over. It'd been over for a year. I hadn't even talked to him. I know. Then why now? We-we were better This whole last year, we've been better. It's the money. If he'd done this last year, You don't finish the train- no bonus. This way, he gets the money. You were wrong. Maybe I did deserve what was coming to me. I'm responsible for this. You risked your life for me and I lied to you about who I was. Everybody does that. I don't care what anybody says. Sometimes it's a lot easier. You did something you regret. We're hardwired to do things we regret. It ain't gonna change. There's nothing to be afraid of. And it's certainly not a reason to die. I don't even know what I owe you. Can you at least tell me your name? Christopher Chance. Is that true? And don't you dare count it. See ya, Chance. Well, I told him his services were no longer needed. Why is that funny? Oh, he'll be back. Oh. Hey, listen, um... what do you say you take some time off now. What are you worried about? What's so different about now than anything else I've ever done? And don't get started about how you think I'm losing it because you sound like an idiot. Well, fine. I did think that at first, that you were loosing focus. I haven't lost focus. No, I-I believe you. I do. And now I'm really worried. I ask myself "why would he just continue to do this- "just put himself in situations where he ends up in front of "one loaded gun after another? "what is it? Is it the rush or some kind of weird penance?" And then it hit me. Maybe he keeps putting himself in front of that loaded gun because deep down, he hopes that one of these days he'll get what he really deserves and the gun will finally go off. Go ahead. Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me you're planning on being around for awhile. What the hell are they doing? I don't know. Open up that bag right there. Whiskey? It's not whiskey. Really? 'cause it looks like a bottle of Japanese whiskey to me. I hired you to protect me from those people. And your plan is to have a smoke and a drink? You know, there was a day I would've felt bad opening up a bottle like this. But I'm learning to live in the now. I mean, it might taste better in ten years, it might be worth more. But what if I'm not around to find out? What the hell are you doing? Ah. You're really missing something here. Smooth. Good finish. You'd never even know this stuff burns like jet fuel. Man, you crazy? Let's find out. Sync, corrected by elderman - for addic7ed. com - Good day, Mr. Finley. Good day, Ms. Miller. Well... Rooster! You out, boy? Got him, Mr. Finley. - Morning, Mrs. Baker. - Morning. Hello, Mr. Perryfield. I am sorry I'm a little late. It's about time. I was about to go inside. There's a storm coming, and my hip's killing me. I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Now, you don't think I'm gonna sit around all day waiting for you when the cold comes, do you? No, sir. Be careful with that top step there. It gives a little. Here goes. Uhh. Ah. Yuck! Blech! And good morning to you! Good morning, Mr. Finley! Good morning, Sheila. Beautiful day, isn't it? - Sure is. - How's Jimmy? - He's doing real good. - Good. You take care now, huh? All right. You, too. Les? About this Brady McDaniels, he's already missed several days this month. I can't keep covering. Hey, Mr. Mullins, go look up the word "fragile". Uh, "Les"? When did I become "Les"? Sorry, uh, Lester... Mr. Stevens. Boss, the guy's a screw-up. It's like he's asking to get canned. How many days this month? Hey, Cathy. Congratulations, girl. Thanks, Mr. S. - Four. - Four? That's not so bad. It's only the 12th. Look, Carl... I just think there's something there worth saving. I thought you were gone already. I need someone good, Lester. This has been my route for ten years. I've been voted Best Postal Carrier seven years and counting. I know, Walter, but it's slim pickings right now. What about that new kid Trevor? Oh, he's slow as mud through a straw. - Kay. - Kay's got a month left on maternity leave. And before you ask, Pete just got his knee scoped. Look, Walter, it's your time now. You've always wanted an extended leave. You've earned it. Go, enjoy. I'll find the right fit. Promise. Okay. But there are a few things you should know. 237, the old man... Cornelius Perryfield... checks the box talk to some local businesses and see if they'd help out, kick in some paint and lumber and stuff. sometimes can be purchased for back taxes, maybe even less if the city wants to unload them. You just need to prove to them that you can take on that sort of responsibility. With your history, that might be a tough call. Yeah. Might need me to co-sign with you. You'd do that for me? I just did a quick cost benefit analysis. you can come stay in the garage with me. No joke. Well, thanks, Mike. figure out what you have to do to pull this together, I'll do whatever I can to help. God will take care of the rest. Power of faith, huh? Hello, Natalie. Hey. - Got a second? - Yeah. I couldn't sleep last night. That story you told in the house just kept running over and over in my head. Well, I'm glad you were there. I have an idea. but the bachelor/bachelorette auction is next month. The money we raise, we donate to local causes and we still haven't decided on a charity to support. I'd like to talk to student council into donating to The Castle. Do you think they'd go for that? I don't see why not. I am the president. What? I'm just surprised, I guess. Well, don't be. Thank you. There is one catch, though. You're gonna have to do me a favor. Name it. Put yourself up for auction. winners revealed at a party we're throwing at the pavilion. You're kidding, right? to put money down on a date with you. It's kind of not my thing. Yeah, but you're the face of the franchise. Can't raise money for The Castle if its leading player isn't in the game. Hey, you know, maybe we can auction Sheedy instead. Do I detect an element of fear in Mr. Fearless? Shorty is poppin'. What's her name? What are you doing here? Just checkin' in. Shouldn't be here. I bumped into Tevin the other day and he seems to remember you and Tuck packing a couple of shovels in a car a couple of days before we got busted. Don't know what he's talking about, man. See, that's gang property, Bren, and it's not doing anybody any good sitting wherever it's at. We need it working for us. We need it in the streets helping us build back up. If Tuck did it, I don't know where it is, okay? See, I wish that I could believe that. Probably should think about this some more. I don't need to think on it, E. You like these people, huh? This place you are now? You like the people you hanging out with now, huh? Seems like a nice place, nice people. And that girl... she real fine. What's that mean? Take it easy, baby. We just having a general conversation, that's all, B. County clerk's office. Hi, I'm looking for information on how to purchase a house. I checked the website that lists properties that have a tax lien. Do you have a parcel ID number? Yes, ma'am, 13004201. Please hold. Yes, ma'am. Brendan, Brendan King. Okay. Natalie, I know you've already locked down a band for the auction, but if you're looking for an opening act, you should check us out. We play mostly alternative rock... I thought we discussed this. Oh, I forgot you're the gatekeeper to the student council now? No, we just don't need an opening act for the auction. Fine, I was just throwing it out there... Shhh! No, I'm sorry. So what do I do? I just go down there and... okay. All right. Thank you. Thirty-five. Thirty-five dollars? They do realize the place isn't even worth 35 cents, right? Yeah, well, how it works is we can go down there and file a petition for it and that sort of makes it ours. But then we have 60 days to come up with the rest. Last year's auction raised $3,500. So, how much to file for a petition, Brendan? Ten dollars. We're gonna do this. Hey, sweetheart. - Hi. - Hi. I talked to Stan today. That job's coming open. Anne Marie's going on maternity leave. I told them I'd discuss it with you. I don't think it's time yet. Yeah, but when we talked about it a couple of days ago, you said it might be. I know. This could be a good thing, Vanessa, getting back to work. I worry. You're out here in the garden a lot, but sometimes it seems to me I mean, you grow all these beautiful flowers... Maybe it's time for you to bring them to some other places, you know, back to the school, back to work, back to church, back to your friends who care about you. I talked to Russell about Brendan. Okay. This was supposed to be about healing? Well, this does not feel like healing to me. It feels like more pain. Vanessa, you don't have to fear the boy. He left that world behind the day he was saved. - Saved? - Mm-hmm. Is that it, Mike? The dark clouds part, the sun shines down and the choir rejoices in song. I didn't... I... Sweetheart. Got a second? What's up? That's what I'm wondering. Lot of stories flying. I've got nothing against you personally. You did a cool thing helping Natalie but some of the stuff I heard you're into, she doesn't need to be around that. You're right, she doesn't. She won't. Good.

If you don't mind me asking, what happened to your family? Sorry. No, it's... my mom died, drugs. And my dad, I don't know who he is. Any brothers or sisters? How does anyone make it through that? My parents are divorced but I know who they are, I know where they are. Is that like a girlfriend tattoo? No, it's kind of like something to remind me of how I got here. A broken heart? It's a mended heart. Is that a cross in the middle? Yeah, I kind of messed that part up. I like that it's not perfect. There. What's the worst thing you've ever done? Well, I've made a lot of bad decisions, but at least I never killed anybody. It's just, um, I'm not proud of them. I have to go. Hey, wait. Natalie, hey, hang on. Hey, hang on. Whatever it is you're going through, you don't, you don't have to do it alone. Brendan... yeah, I do. You're not returning my texts. You thought I would? You said friends, right? I broke up with you. You should hate me right now. Well, I can't. We never really talked about things, about the accident and the other stuff. I don't know what else to say. You're not answering any texts, any calls and anyone sees you outside school, you're hanging out with the Seekers. Yeah, you used to go out and have fun and now something's changed. So what are you saying? You can't tell me you're having it with the Seekers. So it's official then, you've become one of them. Maybe I have. Really? How's Natalie doing these days? Why don't you ask her yourself, man? She doesn't talk to me much lately and when she does, it doesn't sound much like the Natalie that I know. What is it with you? You saved her life, now maybe you think you can save her soul? I mean, isn't that what you guys do in your club? Huh? Let me make this as straight as I can for you. Stay away from her! I don't want any trouble. Yeah, see, I've been on the field against teams loaded with city trash waving their tats and their thug signs. They ain't so bad when it's an even playing field. When they don't have the posse and the hardware. What about when they do got it? Eli, it's okay, man. Yeah, it's okay, bro. Yeah, I know. Got your posse here, don't you? - Put the gun down! - I'm sorry! You got my man outnumbered four to one. Hey, put it down! - Huh? It's more even now, right? - I'm sorry. I know you're sorry. So what you're gonna do is go give my man an apology. I... I apologize. - Put it down. - I ain't buying it. - Say it on your knees. - Enough. - On your knees! - I apologize! Back off! Get out of here, man. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? What I don't get is why you taking this from them. and start waving guns in people's faces. Wow, you got stale in the joint, bro. Come on, you're taking a ride with me. No, man, I'm getting out of here. - Curfew. - Curfew? You don't get it do you? They ain't never gonna accept you out here. You'll always be trash.

Why is that? the behind the music special on me, you can tell them, "I remember meeting Sheedy in the hallway. that his band had just gotten the gig at the charity auction. " - Seriously? - Totally. But I thought they already had a band. Well, they backed out. Would you mind helping me hand out these flyers, though? Isn't that your publicist's job? That's cold, man, that's cold. Hmm, you think that's him right there, right? Yeah, I know that's him. - We got a winner. - Hey, I'm on it. Bad day for a bike ride. I'd say so myself. You want me to keep following him or should I get him now? Yeah, we follow him. Stay close. When we hit him, we hit him hard. Got it. Did you get a look at these guys at all? How many, height, weight, what they're wearing? I really didn't see that much. Hey, Mr. Stubbs. Hey, buddy. How you doing? I'm doing all right. Brendan, don't I look pretty. It is an improvement. Hey, Russell. Mike. Look, I just got one more question for you. We got some security video from the school, caught a glimpse of a van driving pretty fast around the time you were hit. Black van, ring a bell? Look, I really don't remember that much. Give it time. - It'll come back to you. - All right. - Mike. - Yeah. Look, thanks for coming, guys. Yeah, we'll have you back in math class in no time. Brendan? I heard about Chris. I feel so bad. About the other day, I'm sorry I just took off like that. It's cool. I guess I just got scared of what you'd think of me if I told you. Well, you don't have to be. Yeah, I do. It'll change things. Maybe you're playing it just right then. Keep whatever it is buried inside and let it eat away at you until you can't feel or care about anything at all. Yeah, maybe you're right. Natalie? Natalie! Hey, wait! Natalie? I got pregnant last year. I didn't tell anybody. Zack didn't know, or my mom. It was a mistake, but it happened and I dealt with it. I thought it was for the best. Thing of it is I didn't think I was strong enough to have a baby, but now I don't think I'm strong enough to carry this emptiness. I'm not sure of anything anymore. But please, don't tell me faith can fix me, because I cut myself off from God forever. It's okay, I promise. It's okay. Brendan around? He's not here right now. You know, I think it's really nice what you guys are doing for him, the way you gave him a second chance after all the trouble he's been through, you know. Not like it's his fault, though. Kind of like a dog that's bred to be vicious. Can't help it. I think you should leave. See there's a funny thing about fighting dogs, 'cause no matter how many times you try to save them, there's not enough TLC on the planet that can keep him down. Sooner or later, they'll turn. I said he's not here right now. You tell Brendan... Eli says, hey. My mom has this vision of what she wants me to be. I'm afraid that if I tell her, that vision will be destroyed. What about Zack? Where does that stand? Where does that stand? It stands still with Zack. My whole life feels like it's been standing still and then you showed up. You really need to talk to Zack. Yeah. Mom? ♪ You and I will pull the tide and steal the sand ♪ ♪ From beneath your toes ♪ ♪ and bring you closer to the center of the world ♪ ♪ and the center of you ♪♪ Yo, E, it's me. Yeah, we gotta talk. Looks like the transformation stuck, 'cause he ain't the same old, G. What's up, Bren. So this is it, huh? Man, we was family, bonded through blood. Blood that we spilled, blood that we saw spilled because Tuck bled out in front of both of us. You got something you wanna say? Yeah, you wanna hurt somebody, hurt me. That's all you got, huh? E, what you're looking for isn't the answer. Let it go, man. You cannot let go who you are. I did and it's so much better. You can, too, life is supposed to be good, Eli. You've got to be kidding me. Listen, I promise you there is a hope so great that it changed me and it can change you. Last chance, stop trying to save me and save yourself and your new people. You don't have to do this. Did you hear that? - Hmm? - What was that? Can't sleep? Mike. Huh? - Brendan's not back. - Hmm? Mike, Mike! What? Brendan, Brendan! - Brendan. - I'll call 911. No, they'll put him away. Brendan. Help me get him up! Vanessa, help me, please! Don't let him fall. Don't let him fall off the back. Watch his head. Looks like they've gotten to him pretty good. I don't wanna bring this in here. I don't want this in here. Vanessa, we already have. I'm gonna call the police. Vanessa, help me, please. You know what to do, I don't. - Oh, I'm sorry! - Shh... There's no way for me to know what is going on, if there's internal bleeding or anything, I don't know that. Okay, easy, easy, easy. I need a cover. It's okay, buddy. Relax, Brendan. It's okay, it's okay, relax. Ice pack. Place it right over there. Two minutes on, two minutes off this area. This is all I can do. Okay. Hello, County. Detective Russell Dwyer, please. I haven't seen him yet, ma'am. It's a bit early. Can I help you? When will he be in? His shift starts at 7:00. Oh. Is there a message? Ma'am? No, no message. It's okay, son. I know what you set out to do, you know, I do, but it's too much. I mean, first the car, the house, now this? - V... - Listen! The boy needs to be under the care of a doctor! He needs to be in a hospital! Hospitals ask questions. You know that. He's aged out of the system. This is his last stop. Then what? He goes back out to the streets? If that happens, Mike, it's not our fault. It's not on us. Maybe not, but it feels like it is. I have always been surrounded by men who could never turn their backs on people in need and I guess I should feel like that's a blessing, but I feel abandoned! Lewis never abandoned you. Well, then why am I here and he's not? Oh, really, V, really? You're not here in any sense that I remember. Lewis was taken, but then you've gone and given everything else away. I was abandoned by whoever I was praying to all those years. Why did he let it happen? Why? I mean, I have tried, Mike, I swear to you I have tried to believe that there's a reason. I mean, there's a reason for everything, right? That's what we're always telling ourselves, right? Well, I can't think but that maybe the only answer is that there is no answer! there's just random chaos and that's all there is. Lewis's death was a tragedy, but God will use it for a better purpose. I believe that, V, I really do. I know. Now, we can turn away from this kid or we can turn to him. I wish I could believe like you believe. It's been a long, long, long, long road and I... I really don't know anymore. I just don't know. V... No, I can't, just let me get... He was in a fight. Where? Don't know. He's not saying. He got roughed up pretty bad, though. Can I see him? He's resting now and I'm not so sure he'd want you to see him like that. He didn't say what happened? I'll tell him you stopped by. Maybe I should help you with that. I got it. Look, it's not a request. Just take a break. I'll do it. Okay. Thank you. Hey! Hey! What happened with you and Brendan? What? Did you get in a fight with him? No, but he's been in a fight, got hurt pretty bad. Wasn't me. What do you see in him anyway? With all his baggage, where is he really going? He's turned his life around. Right, through Jesus. What is it that you don't like? or someone that has a relationship with God? Both. Some kids just substitute the God thing in for whatever else they've been using or abusing, instead of whatever other kind of crazy they were before. Some are downright scary, not to mention being the biggest hypocrites. Brendan's not crazy and he's not a hypocrite. You haven't known him long. He could just be using you, using your issues and his religion thing for whatever he wants. Stop calling it a thing, a God thing, a religion thing. It isn't a thing to him, it's a way of life, a way to life when he was headed for death before. Listen to yourself! You sound like a Bible thumper. I'd rather sound like anybody in the world right now than what you sound like. Just be still. Be still, Brendan, shh. You're safe. Shh. Shh... shh. Morning, V. Russell. I was passing on my way to work and the scent of that omelet stopped me in my tracks. Well, you know what? You can just have half of this one. That sounds good. Hey, listen, you didn't happen to call my number at the station the other morning? Me? Yeah, caller ID put the number here. What call where? - Hey, morning, Mike. - Morning. Did you call the station the other morning? Did I? Look, if there's something you wanna say, I'm all ears. Nothing to be afraid of. Is that kid causing you some trouble? Brendan? No. Oh! My brain. It was me. I did call you. Yeah, you know you were telling us about that rec center? Yeah. Well, Mike and I discussed it and we want to donate some of Lewis's things. - Right. - Yeah. You're starting to part with some of Lewis's things. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Well, did you get it? Did I get what? The rec center's number. No, not yet. Thank you. Brendan really thinks that he's gonna take the house. That should be and could be making us a whole lot of money. And make a clubhouse. Make it hot, Lex. You wanna play games? Breaking news this morning, firefighters were busy in the city last night with a suspected case of arson. A fire apparently started shortly before 2:00 a. m. at a house on Scio Street. They put it out about 15 min... How you feeling? Can I get you something to eat, drink? Sure. Brendan, you know that house that you guys were working on? There was a fire. I'm sorry. Hey. Hey. Look, I didn't mean to just pop in on you. I just wanted to know you're okay. Here, I got something for you. It's not a big deal, just saw it at the mall last week and... Brendan? - I can't take this. - What? Brendan, we'll find another house. We'll start all over. I'll talk to student council. We can still use the auction to support this. If you're trying to scare me, it's working. Maybe you should be scared of me. Yeah, well, you would be if you know what's inside me. What does that mean? Come on, you can tell me anything. Brendan, will you please say something? Why don't you say something? Say something to Zack, say something to your mom. Let them know what you're dealing with. They're the ones you should be concerned about. Forget about me, I'm... You should just go, Natalie. That's it? After everything? Packing? I put you and Vanessa in a bad spot, Mike. You wanna tell me what's going on? I helped a friend bury some stuff before we got arrested. Drugs. The guys that beat you up, they know that? Yeah, and they're gonna hurt some people if I don't get it back to them, people close to me. Like Sheedy, like the house that they burned down. - Then give it to them. - It's not that simple, Mike. If I had it my way I'd let it stay buried, let it rot, but they won't let that happen. it's out there on the streets hurting people and ruining lives and I won't let that happen. That doesn't leave you many options, does it? Only one that I know of. Only one because you're only listening to your own voice. You're shutting out God. Can't you see that? Yeah, I did that, too. When they took away my baby boy, I turned my back on God, tried to handle it on my own. I held my thumb out for a way out, Mike, and it didn't come, okay? So now I gotta do this my way. - It is not too late, Brendan. - I gotta go, Mike. No, no, you wanna make this a fight of flesh and blood, but it's not. It's spiritual with the powers of darkness. The enemy is afraid of what you can truly become. You need to turn this over to God right here, right now. Mike, I gotta go. - Put the bag down. - Mike... Put it down! Sit down. Sit down! Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways, submit to him and he will make your paths straight. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all. He will fight this fight for you, son. I know. We should talk to Russell. You come on down when you're ready. Brendan! Where in the city is he going? I don't know. Well, what do you know, Mike? What can you tell me? There's been a van hanging out here for the past couple of days, a black van. Here's the license plate. Look, I told you this is a bad idea Russell, the kid's heart is in the right place. I've seen inside their hearts, Mike. The day I found Lewis on the side of the road. No, no, that's not what it is! Yeah, it is. It's not your fault, Russell. - What? - Lewis. Look, I'm talking about Brendan, Mike, not Lewis. in every conversation we've had for the past four years. - Oh. - You and Vanessa both. I told you once and I'll tell you again, Lewis did not become a cop because you encouraged him or you nudged him. He became a cop because he wanted to! It's not on you, Russell, and you don't have to make it your mission to protect Vanessa and me. Well, it feels like I do. You got to let it go. All right, where is it? Should be right here. Should be where? Look, we buried it 15 feet from that tree. - Calm down. - I said it's under here. Let's dig. That's what we came to do. Just shut up and dig, man. You shut up. Let's go. You guys been fighting like little girls since you joined the set. You know, we weren't happy doing what we had to do, Bren. It hurt, man. I just want you to know. You are a brother to us. And Lex, you're digging incredibly slow. Rish, will you help him, please? Yo, this dude's playing us, E, there's nothing in here. Calm down, all right, because Brendan knows what happens when people play me. Come on, dig, man. This is empty, man. Brendan, where's the box? Oh, yeah. And the gong sounds, tough guy. That's the music I was waiting to here, come on. Funny how the memory works, huh? Yeah, yeah, it's supposed to be heavy. This is what you do for family. Let me see it. Got your blade? Back up. Get up! Get over there. Get up! - Get on your knees. - All right. All of you. What are you doing, Brendan? You're not gonna shoot us... Oh, come on, man, take it easy, Brendan, take it easy. Get the brick, Lex, and put it back in the cooler. Close it up. This is not how you treat family, Brendan. You ain't my family, Eli. Family's supposed to care about each other. All you ever did was care about yourself. This is gonna stop. This is gonna stop right now! Don't, man, don't. All right. Just take the stuff, all right, take it and go. I don't want it, Eli. Don't, don't. Just get out of here. Get the box. Get the box. This ain't over, Bren. And you know it. You never came to bed. I couldn't. Just hope he's all right. I thought for sure I heard him come back last night and when I looked outside, it was the car next door. And if it was him, would you let him stay after everything now? This scares me, Mike, it does. I wouldn't let anyone hurt you. He was addicted to this game. Tried to teach it to me a million times. I could never seem to get the hang of it.

Willie: How are you? Nucky: Where are you calling from? Willie: Philadelphia. I'm in philadelphia and... Nucky: Willie, is something wrong? Willie: I need your help. ( chirping ) Nucky: Eddie! Eddie, are you up there? Eddie. - Eddie? - ( knocks ) Tom: Mr. Thompson. - Have you seen him today? - No. Bring the car around. Make it quick. Would you like some? You can say yes or no. Doesn't obligate you to anything. No, thank you. You're welcome. Sounds funny, doesn't it? - How's that? - He said, "no, thank you." I said, "you're welcome." doesn't sound right. Uh... Sound right to you? You do not say "you're welcome" When someone says "no, thank you." Why? Because they have not accepted anything from you. His english is better than yours. Heck, I guess it is. Where did you learn it? Did you study it over in prussia, I guess you would have called it? Why am I here? - Why do you think you're here? - I do not know. People don't get hauled off the street for no reason, do they? Do they get hauled off the street for no reason? I am not a policeman. - No one thinks you're a policeman. - We're the policemen. I have done nothing wrong. You had a pistol up your sleeve. - That is for protection. - Against who? Apaches. What do you think we should do? Don't see what choice we have. Darn it. Darn it to heck. Yeah. I may leave? - You almost fell. - I am fine. You don't look fine. You look very unsteady. I think you should stay here for a while. For your own good. Give bill pflaum the broom And he'll sweep cicero clean. Stand beside bill, And he'll stand up for you. A straight town is a healthy town. Healthy for your family and healthy for you. So let's shake hands... Why must they disturb the people so early? It's election day, dear. They have the right to campaign. They should not make so much fuss And do what they are told. That wouldn't be very democratic. Everybody is talking always. Everybody has the opinion. - Nothing gets done. - Dada. - He must eat. - He doesn't want any more. He does not know what he wants. ( car horn honking ) Your friends have returned. Built this whole thing yourself? The rosetta model. Put some grass down there. Spruce it up. That's the summer project. ( whistle blows ) Time for the morning shift. Let's go, george. Gonna be a good day. ( wings fluttering ) How are you, will? I'm okay. A little shaken? No, I'm-- Yeah. We'll sort this out. That's the first thing you need to know. Do my parents-- Right now this is between us. I'm gonna do my best to keep it that way. They haven't charged you yet. That's very good. Why can't I leave? There are reporters upstairs living in the lobby Just looking for something to do. You can walk out of here a suspect in a capital case. They'll smell that in a second. Or you can walk out like someone who just paid a parking ticket. That's what we want. You need to give me a little time. But you-- You know people in philadelphia, right? I do and I'll call on them. If that's what's required. I'll make it up to you. I swear. Don't worry about that now. Let's talk about this boy. I didn't have anything to do with it. Let's just talk about him for a minute. ( faint music playing ) Now, now. Now, now. Hotel arlington. Yes, mr. Roy phillips, please. I beg your pardon? I don't see how that's any of your concern. How do I know he hasn't arrived since the last time I-- Yes. The same message. It's all right. Hey. - Hey, boss. - Frank: Clear a path, boys. - Hey, frank. - Morning. - How's it going, boss? - Frank. So I heard pflaum caught a couple last night. No, they just capped his knees. I don't know nothing about that. What about the guy that got his throat cut on 22nd? His whole throat? - Nah, only to here. - ( men laugh ) So he can still whistle, huh? ( men laugh ) That's a good one, frank. Let's check in on his highness. ( knocks ) ( snorting ) What are you doing? Training my flea circus. What do you think? Frank: Why don't you give it a break? What, like you ain't been touching it? We got business today. ( snorting ) What'd I just say? Don't do that. Al: What, you think I'm kidding? Put that thing away. What the fuck's he doing here? You asked for him, garibaldi. You liked the way he handled himself last night. I did? The woods! Daniel fucking crockett. Pow! ( mocking ) "you'd better run." ( laughs ) Hey, george, you know what day it is? - Election day. - April fools'. All the suckers, they're gonna find out that the joke's on them. You know who that includes? - I don't. - Guess. - I can't. - He likes flowers. - Mr. O'banion. - ( laughs ) Listen to him. Come here. Closer. Come on. I won't hurt you. You done bad things. I saw you. So have you. Yes, I have. But not to the guy I work for. You got a little wild streak. Huh? Let's see how you do today. Then we'll talk. 'cause there's some unfinished business with the florist. Leave all that for later. Al. Go out there, pick the 20 best men you can find, Take them over to the main gate at western electric. Help the voters make up their minds. You with us? He needs to ask his wife. I don't need to ask anyone anything. Ooh. ( laughs ) I think he wants to bite me. Respect the boundaries, huh? Still got that piece? You mean this? Hold on. Shouldn't be any need, but... Are you okay, then? Hey! Perk yourself up. I'm fine right now. Don't you want to be my friend? ( snorts ) Yeah! Who's gonna fuck with us, huh? Huh? ( growls ) Willie: We had a party. Nucky: Who's we? Just the fellas, My roommate clayton and me. - Some girls. - Uh-huh. There was liquor. Where'd that come from? Will, you need to tell me. It was... Mr. Doyle. Mickey sold you liquor? Why didn't you come to me? I didn't want you to know. But I know now. You see, will? The liquor came from me. I didn't know, and now there's a problem. I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. I'm sorry. All right, mickey sold you liquor. You brought it back to school. It was just a party. Everybody was having a good time. The next morning, henry was-- He wasn't moving. I don't know. Did he drink a lot? As much as anyone else. - But he was the only one who-- - yes. How well did you know him? I didn't. I thought he was your friend. What? When we had dinner, you called him a friend. I don't have a lot of friends here, uncle Nucky. I'm going to talk to the district attorney. If he's just fishing, then I'll know it And it all goes away. What you have to do is pull yourself together And remember the truth. Let me ask you again, Was henry your friend? Yes. How much did he drink? A lot. Where'd you get the liquor? I didn't bring any liquor. Good. Man: Following an inspection of your domicile, The officer will submit a report-- Mrs. Darmody? Mrs. Darmody, are you all right? You're looking a bit peaked. I didn't sleep last night. I'm sorry to hear it. I wake up and I think, "must check on tommy." - I'm out of bed and I realize-- - yes. I realize he's not there. And there's no getting back to sleep. Not at all. After the officer submits a report, The court will make its final determination Regarding the question of custody. What do I have to do? You don't have to do anything. What the officer will be looking for is a true picture Of the home the boy would be returning to. I'm in a period of transition. A great deal of the furniture-- The furniture is not important. A gentleman I've been seeing, He's highly placed in an important national firm. A great deal of responsibility. He'd prefer not to have that bandied about. He prides himself on discretion. And his taste in decor is... May I trouble you for a glass of water? Oh! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - It's all right. - I don't know what's wrong with me today. ( winces ) oh, dear. Here. Clench it tight for a minute. I must look quite a horror. Not at all. I'm just in such a state. You reach a point in life and you realize it's what you leave behind that matters. And the thought that tommy might not remember me at all, As if I never even existed. Best to take it one step at a time. Is there anything I can do to help my situation? - As I explained-- - I mean right now. Is there anything I can do right now? - Mrs. Darmody. - Yes? It would be in your best interest To leave these chambers immediately. I'm late for an appointment. Mr. Thompson. Eugene mulhearne. I'm an assistant district attorney. How do you do? Mr. Mulhearne, you're not who I want to see. The district attorney asked me to meet with you And answer any questions you might have. - Why isn't he here? - He had other obligations, regretfully. - You fellows are making a mistake. - How's that? Trying to turn a quirk of fate into what? A manslaughter charge? 10 separate witnesses say he brought liquor to that party. Is that really worth your time and effort? If that boy was poisoned, then yes. Where are you getting that from? His symptoms are consistent with poisoning. - Alcohol poisoning. - That's not what the coroner says. What's that got to do with my nephew? This office intends to find out. Let's cut the bullshit. Your boss and waxey gordon Had a conversation this morning at my request And it was agreed that this occurrence, Terrible as it was, isn't anybody's fault. That couple outside, They're henry gaines's parents. Mr. Gaines is a major contributor To the pennsylvania republican party. He's lost his son And he doesn't want to hear about life's random misfortunes. Someone's got to answer for this. We just don't have any choice. - How are we keeping? - I am fine. You are fine. I admire that kind of backbone. Does he know how tough you are? Who? Your boss, mr. Thompson. I understand. Good soldier. Really, the more I see of you, the more I like. But let me ask this-- Would he do the same for you? ( seagulls screeching ) You've been here all day, eddie. No one's asked for you. Not on the boardwalk, not over at the onyx club, Not in the speaks or the wire rooms. The world is going on without you. Nucky thompson is going on without you. And the only person who really cares what happens to you right now Is me. You are my friend? No, I am not. Then who are you? ( groans ) - That's who I am. - ( coughs ) And I'm going to own every last bit of you. ( coughing ) Clean yourself up. Nucky: Who was henry gaines? He was a friend of mine. Who brought the liquor? Beats me. How much did henry drink? A lot. Who slipped him the mickey? The what? The mickey finn. The knockout punch. Whatever was in there. I- - I don't, uh-- Willie, I have to ask you not to lie just now. It won't help. And frankly, I don't like it. I need to know what's true So we can agree on the rest. Understood? It was supposed to be a gag. That's all. Whose idea was it? Mine. Just yours? Willie. Clayton helped me. Your roommate? And henry? What did he do to deserve it? He thought he was better than me. But he wasn't. All right. Here's what I'm going to need you to do. Factory gates are there, Polling booth down that way. You know the situation. Make sure they vote for klenha Or don't vote at all. Most people, they don't want trouble. Who's the mayor, who's the president, What's it to them? We'll run this burg. Keep the green flowing. That's all anyone cares about. And o'banion? Lots of ways to do business. See how it plays out. Got the piece? Right here. Then hop to it. Hey. Don't worry about my brother, okay? Sometimes he just needs a good kick in the ass. Who's gonna do the kicking? It's an advance. Stick with me, huh? I'll put grass on your fucking lawn. I'm ready. Hello. There's no reason for this to get out of hand. All we need to do is remind them Why it's in their own best interest to elect the republican ticket. As each worker goes by, I want you to inquire - How he intends to vote. - Inquire? They already know what can happen And most people don't want trouble. I didn't come out for no tea social. - Al says give it to 'em good. - Al's not in charge here. - I am. - You ain't in charge of nothing. Man: I say we pick the first guy and clobber him. - We're doing it my way. - Or what? Go ahead and try. ( whistle blows ) - Coming through. - Coming through here. - Who you voting for today? - None of your damn business. - Voting republican, friend? - What's it to you? Got a minute? Hold on there. I'm talking to you. Just stop for a second, god damn it! - ( grunts ) - ( men shouting ) Move back! Move back! Come on. Johnny, go, go! Let's go, let's go! You see, none of this had to happen. Man: Move, move! Let me in! Let me in! Man #2: Get inside! - ( men chatting, laughing ) - ( music playing ) ( chatting stops ) ( man coughs ) I, uh... I'm looking for someone. I don't know his name, But I'm told he could be found here. I realize we've never met before. This is probably not how you normally conduct business, But I made some inquires. Here I am. You far from home, bo peep. Nothing is very far from anything here. Is it? You're gonna take the skin off. Who sent you around? Does that matter? I like to know where my customers come from. I spent several years on the stage. Do tell. - You know how show people are. - How are they? We like to keep our ears close to the ground. Well, what you got tucked up your little pouch there? May I examine the preparation first? No, you mayn't. That's all I've got. Then you find that lost sheep somewhere else. Perhaps we could discuss another form of payment? I'm having a difficult day, mr...? - Oxford. - Mr. Oxford. A very difficult day. Just one of those times When you need a little extra help. That's all this is. You best go easy now, little bo. I like my lambs keep coming home. Where I went? State normal over in trenton. Your aunt mabel was there. She was going to be a teacher. I didn't like the idea of other fellas Helping her with the classwork. So I thought I'd be a teacher, too. Why didn't you? The commodore needed me. And I came back home. There are more important things than what may Or may not have happened at some party. My father won't know? No one will know. ( door opens ) Mr. Thompson. Lawrence eisley. Mr. District attorney. Thanks for making the time. - Sorry for the mix-up earlier. - Not to worry. But I'm sure you can appreciate my concern. Oh, I'd feel the same way if it was my nephew. We want to get this cleared up before it turns into something. I completely understand. Well, young man, I'm told you might be able to help us With this unfortunate event. Nucky: You just tell them what happened As best you remember it. First thing I want to say is... Henry gaines was a pal of mine. ( bell ringing ) ( children chatting ) Teacher: No running. We are ladies and gentlemen here. Tommy, I've told you time and time again, walking. Darling. It's me. It's mima. Look at you. You're a beautiful little man. I'm going to kiss you hello. May I do that? Are you learning a lot here? That makes mima so happy Because she wants you to be smart. She wants you to be the smartest boy there ever was. Now, there's something I have to tell you. I met a man. A very sweet man. His name is roy. I think you're going to like him. We're all going to be together And that's going to make us so happy. Won't that be nice? All right. All right. I have something for you. It's-- here it is. It's an abba-zaba. ( laughs ) I don't know what that is, But I'm sure it's wonderful. And it's for you. And we're going home now. It's all been taken care of. You're going to come home with-- With me. Hello, julia. How are you? I'm very well. Are these your relations? They're teachers. Of course they are. - Well, then... - What are you doing here? Just bringing tommy home. He doesn't live with you anymore. Now, julia, that's for the judge to decide. We had a chat today and he was very forthcoming. Come on, sweetie. I'm here. No, no. This isn't proper. It's a beautiful day and this isn't proper. We're going to walk this way. Okay? And we're not looking back. - This way, ma'am. - Let go of me. - Let's go. Come on. - Let go of me. - You don't have the right. - Now, please. You can't just bleach me out like a laundry stain. - Let go of me. - Come on. I have to give him the abba-zaba. ( music playing ) Here it is. Not bad. It's okay. Ma put up the curtains. Can you play this? Not really. You need to find yourself a girl to serenade. Give you an incentive. Shut the door for a minute, will. - Uncle Nucky-- - No lecture. Just a few things I want to say. Whatever occurred, it's over. But every now and then you'll think About the terrible thing that happened to a boy Whose face you can't quite remember. I promise, you can live with it. Is that what you do? You're going to graduate. We'll get you into another school If that's what's necessary. It's not important now. You worry about what other people might say. You worry about someone you call a friend. None of that matters. The only thing you can count on is blood. The blood that's in your veins And the blood that's in mine. The people who discount you, They don't know who you are. The rage you feel-- listen to me careful-- It's a gift. Use it. But don't let anyone see it. Know that I'm watching over you. Show me the person you intend to be. How much did you pay the district attorney? One day we'll talk about all that. Right now, you just need to stick to what we discussed And not worry about the rest. ( door opens ) I'm sorry. - You're clayton? - Yes, sir. You're willie's father? No, his uncle. Oh. How do you-- I'll come back later. - I was just-- - it's all right. I have to get back home. Remember what we talked about. It's good to meet you, clayton. Where the hell have you been all day? Didn't feel like going to class. Christ, will, everybody's talking about-- What are we gonna do? It's taken care of. What does that mean? It's been taken care of. He's dead, will. That's not just gonna go-- Clayton, I have to study. What? There's a test in commerce tomorrow And I have to study. So how about you leave me alone? ( men shouting ) Worker: Let's see what you got, tough guy. Mueller! Out of the way. Move. Move. What the fuck's going on here? A numerically disadvantaged situation. A what?

It matters to me. - ( workers clamoring ) - worker: This is america! We need those extra men or we need to leave. Shut the fuck up! I'll nail you in front of a cigar stand With a warbonnet on your scalp. - Take this. - Al: Hey! Hey! ( shouting ) This is how it is. We're running cicero. It's all done legal. Anybody don't like it, then step out here. Worker: Come on. Come on, guys. Come on. Just one of you. Step out If you think you got the fucking balls. Get them dago sons of bitches!

( door opens ) I called you 10 times. I'm here. Did I do something wrong? Not to me. You were very cold when I found you. I must have just fallen asleep. How you feeling now? Better. Rough day? Or shouldn't I ask? What were you doing in the powder room? Cleaning this up for you. Found it lying on the floor. That's-- that's just-- Yeah, I know what it is. Does that help you? Not anymore. How does that make you feel? Terrified. I must repulse you. No. I know about weakness. And I know about sin. You don't know about me. Then tell me If that would make any of this better. Roy... I have done the most awful things. Tuch. Manufaktur. Und konfektionsgeschaft. Karstadt. Selby: That's a mouthful. We just say department store. What is that? This is something we've been waiting for. - Now it's arrived. - From far across the seas. Stellvertretender direktor. Selby: Assistant manager. Was that a good job? It was a position of respect. - Watch over the employees. - Make sure nobody steals. There were many responsibilities. And they all depended on loyalty, didn't they? Loyalty and honesty. - You pride yourself on that. - I strive. You strive. You strive. Did you even tell your wife? - Your sons? - Knox: Or just leave with the money? Selby: The money and mistress. Knox: She worked behind the lingerie counter. How long did that last? Not long. So much for happiness, huh, ed? I am a legal resident of the United States. You are what I say you are. And I say you don't belong here. Then deport me. ( speaking german ) ( speaks german ) I was army intelligence during the war. I thought the language was very beautiful. "a father rides with his son through night and wind. The child is terrified. A demon in the woods. The elfking." What does the father say, ed? ( speaking german ) - "only a wisp of fog." - ja. But the father is wrong and the elfking is real And the son-- what happens to the son, ed, in beautiful german? ( speaking german ) "in his arms The child was dead." Ja. Your boys, konrad and lucas, they're grown men now. Lucas has a son of his own. - What? - They changed their last name. As if you didn't even exist. To escape the shame their father the thief, The liar, the traitor Brought upon them. Six days from now, you'll be in the custody of the hanover police. Then you and your boys can get acquainted kite airborne. Were you a pilot before you retired, Mr Greaves? Uh, no. No. I'm just happy to be part of it these days. But once flying is in your blood, that's it. Nothing like it. Up above the clouds, sun shining. Like being in heaven. I'm sure it is. The papers practically accuse the mechanics union of sabotaging that plane. Well, somebody did. The fuel was deliberately contaminated. Is that why you called me in? It gets worse, I'm afraid. One of my men failed to report for duty this morning. Flight Lieutenant James Manning, the officer who walked away from that wreck, hell bent on finding out who was responsible. You think he asked too many questions. I hope not. And another onslaught of bad publicity could be the death of us. This needs a... a delicate touch. Squadron Leader Willis Jones is organising our air show. A challenging exercise in public relations, I gather. Yes. Apart from the technicalities. We have other flyers but Manning is a... one-off. When did you notice he was gone? After formation practice yesterday. Anything missing from his quarters? His uniform is gone, his wallet. Everything else is untouched. Is there anyone he was particularly close to who might know why he disappeared? The police to see you, Sir. Jack, what on earth are you doing here? Same thing as you I imagine, Miss Fisher. Detective Inspector Jack Robinson. Group Captain Lyle Compton. That'll be all, Jones. Group Captain, a woman has been found dead near your perimeter fence. ~ Dead? ! ~ I was aware there was an incident. ~ You didn't know? ~ No. Um... Compton and I are old friends. I was here on another matter. I'll need a list of names of any personnel who left the base in the last 24 hours. No-one was authorised to leave the base, I can tell you that right now. ~ What about unauthorised? ~ Phryne. ~ Who was this woman? ~ We don't know, as yet. This has no connection with the Air Force. If I find a connection? There'll be a thorough investigation. Keep me informed, Inspector. You'll find me at the morgue, Miss Fisher. I can't promise to keep all your secrets, Compton. Not if it stands between Jack and bringing a murderer to justice. At least be discreet. Please. Keep me posted. Dotty. What... what are you doing here? I'm here on official business, Hugh. Already? I know Miss Fisher has a nose for trouble, but this is a military base with guns and men. It could be very dangerous. ~ The war is over, Hugh. ~ I know... And sometimes Miss Fisher needs me to do dangerous things, like be a hostage or pretend to be a racing car driver, or even... go up in a plane. What? You're terrified of planes. ~ Collins. ~ Sir. Jack, wait. You know I can't resist a murder, if it is a murder. I found these by the body. The missing airman's service number. I think I found your connection. It's a chilly night to be out without a coat. Severe dehydration and asphyxia. My bet, some kind of poison. Found that inside her clothing. I presume it was around her neck. Those keys. She had better access to the Air Force than I do. Perhaps Flight Lieutenant James Manning gave her access. Perhaps they were lovers. Or maybe just old friends. I met Compton back in England at the end of the war. I flew a couple of low-key missions with him, that's all. No lighter and only one unlit cigarette. But a serious smoker. ~ Missions, as in intelligence. ~ Not officially. 'Flight... earth... eyes turn skyward... .. have been and there... will always long...' A love letter. Sounds very literary. And very aeronautical. So Captain Courageous is entrusting Mata Hari with another secret mission. Compton was a long time ago, Jack, and it wasn't like that. Well, yes, it was, but... You know what it's like when you think life is fleeting and you might die at any moment. I always feel like that when I'm with you. Call with any details that might help Missing Persons. The murderer seems to have made off with anything that might establish who she was. But perhaps not where she's been. 4.5 pence fare, 9 sections. So... one, two, three... Where would I find the headquarters of the Victorian Amalgamated Mechanics Association? European Club, that's where you'll find them. Hobnobbing with Bert's red-ragger mates. If memory serves me, that's somewhere on Sydney Road? Sydney Road, Brunswick. We know James Manning was nosing around them, trying to find out who sabotaged his plane. Perhaps that's where he met this mystery woman. Does that match our ticket? Yes, Miss. This ticket will get you there. Sounds like you ladies need an escort to the wrong side of town. ~ Any excuse to see you-know-who. ~ Who? Some Russian sheila he's soft on. She works in the cloak room. She hemmed me trousers, that's all. Don't mention Mr Butler, or the stock exchange. And don't say you send out your laundry. I doubt your comrades will care who washes my Herminie Cadolle lingerie. ~ And don't talk like a toff. ~ Sorry. You can get out. You're no use to anyone. Let me just say that this... this is Australia. Not Russia! So now you've got a problem with the revolution! What are you - a bloody idiot? You think a bunch of words is going to change the world? Why don't you hand your card in? Go on, throw it on the table. Mr Higgins, my boss needs a little help. Alright. Miss Fisher. Rupert Higgins. Pleased to meet you. Albert here claims that as far as capitalist bosses go, you're not too bad. Noblesse oblige. I do my best from the high, Mr Higgins. Like you, I'm sure. This couple you want to know about. Yes. This is James Manning. ~ Military. ~ Air Force. Though I doubt he would've shown off his uniform in here. And I'm not sure that they were a couple. He's not familiar. What about the woman? Tall, dark-haired, late 20s. There was a young woman that started coming to our meetings a few weeks ago. Do you remember her name? That's another thing people don't show off in here. We've been raided too many times. Seditious publications. I remember she did pick a few pamphlets up afterwards. If it's the woman you're after, she seemed smart, educated. ~ So she was alone. ~ That's why I noticed her. This isn't the kind of place frequented by single women. Apart from a few remarkable exceptions. Why are you trying to track her down? That's the problem, we're not. She was found in bushland early this morning. Suspected murder. No, she never say her name. I can't believe she's killed. Tatiana, meet Miss Fisher. Hello. Tatiana Fyodorov. I know this woman, but she's not my friend. She's my customer. And she was here last night. Yes, I see her, but... I know she looks fancy, but you can trust her. I see her with a man from here. Higgins. You know him? Go on, love. Uh, on the stairs. He did not see me, but he... he have her arm like this. Strong. Was he friendly or angry? They were whispering. I could not hear. But from their faces, it was important. Thank you, Miss Fyodorov. You've been most helpful. Please, don't say I tell you. Don't worry, we'll keep it under our hats. What's that? May I have that coat, the dusty rose one? ~ It's her missing coat. ~ Yes. Yes, she left it here. This is to fix the insides, here. Thank you. We may need an expert opinion. The fabric is excellent quality, a silk wool jersey. So the whole ensemble would've been very expensive. If I could examine it more closely, I might find a dressmaker's mark. Of course. Collins. I also found something in the coat pocket, but you're going to have to play nicely. Why aren't you at the RAAF, wing walking or something? Now, that won't score you any points. I've managed to score a few without you. European Club - haunt of militant unionists, including the Amalgamated Mechanics and committed red-ragger Rupert Higgins. The logical deduction with the union trouble at the RAAF, Higgins' file, belonging to an unlawful association charge, dismissed ten years ago. Sedition charge still pending. Do you think our victim was passing James Manning information? It could explain what she was doing near the base with his keys. What about next of kin on Manning's military file? You should be impressed I managed to get his service number before Compton whisked it away. You know, you and Compton are very similar, Jack. I think you'd like him. I don't think one necessarily follows the other. Alright, full points for that. A match for the love letter. I was hoping we might try that new pie cart for lunch. Were you? I know we've got a few things to settle before our big day. ~ Like my job. ~ Like your job. But I thought we could also talk about... settling on a date. So... maybe you could worry about that and leave the investigating to Miss Fisher. And maybe you can try that pie cart on your own. I've suddenly lost my appetite. Dot... Here's the cast of that boot print, Sir. It's a big one. At least size 12. Possible match for a flying boot. In need of repair. If that's the print near the body, I doubt it belongs to James Manning. How do you know? The only other thing I gleaned from his file was his height - 5'6". Hardly a giant. No. A men's shoe size 8, 9. 10 at the most. So we're looking for a tall airman, Sir. Well, that whittles it down to about 85% of the Air Force. Bring the car round, Collins. We're here to see Captain Compton. I have my orders, sir. Miss Fisher only. Surely the Group Captain didn't say I couldn't be escorted by my fiance. Such a... masculine environment is overwhelming for a single woman. Let me check for you. Oh, there's no need to escort us. I know the way. Admit it, Jack, being a woman definitely has its assets. Well, I... appreciate your assets. Now, if we could hurry up this break-in. I'm not breaking anything. I'm merely taking a circuitous route. Keys. Numbers would have made this a lot easier. Suggest that to your captain friend. Eureka. ~ Third time lucky. ~ Fourth. Must you be so contrary? James Manning's locker. James Manning and Willis Jones. Can I help you? Miss Fisher. Detective Inspector Jack Robinson, meet Squadron Leader Willis Jones. I've told Miss Fisher everything I know about James Manning. I'm also interested in another matter - the woman found dead this morning outside the base. I saw the police car. We have reason to believe that Flight Lieutenant James Manning knew the dead woman. What's this got to do with me? Your boots are a match for a very particular footprint we found beside the body. ~ You need your right heel repaired. ~ What? You also need to tell us more about your relationship with James Manning. Where did you get that? Yes, Miss Fisher, where did you get that? As you were, Jones. You two, with me. We have good reason to believe both men were at the crime scene. ~ I'm not interested in speculation. ~ I am. ~ What about a love triangle? ~ I can't imagine that. Well, it's not that difficult - one woman, two men. It has been known to lead to conflict. We need to conduct a more extensive search... I'm sorry but I can't allow a civilian search on military grounds. How do you expect me to conduct my investigation? Inspector, I appreciate you have a job to do and a public to answer to, but so do I, and at this point in history, I believe my position to be the more precarious. I do hope you understand. On another matter, Phryne. A personal one. There could never be a love triangle. Willis and James would never fight over any woman. ~ Lovers! ~ I have no proof, of course, but... If it were to get out, it would be the last straw for the RAAF and for me. Even so, both of them had something to do with that woman, and if you genuinely want me to find out what happened to James, then you have to give me free access to this place. Greaves... please escort Miss Fisher on a full tour of the base. Wherever she wants to go, whatever she needs to know. Hello, Hugh. I've come to return your evidence. How are you going with that postmark? Uh, good. I'm nearly there. That town definitely starts with a 'C' and it's nine letters long. Might help to narrow it down to the suburbs of Perth. And why would I do that? Bon Marche. Perth, Western Australia. Yes, that... that might help but... still not the answer, is it? Stick to the whole of Australia, then, Hugh. Can't be easy - military man in charge of a unionised workforce. Oh, they all towed the line well enough. ~ Till the rumours started. ~ About Willis and James? I wasn't the only one who saw him sneak out of Willis's quarters at all hours. The moment he arrived he started work on Willis, preyed on him. ~ So Willis lost respect. ~ Hmm. Then that plane came down and James pointed the finger at the union. What did he accuse them of - shoddy work or party politics? Both, and it didn't make Willis's life any easier. Do you think Willis will be able to pull off this air show? Without a doubt. He's a better flyer than James ever was. He can loop the loop and barrel roll like a bird. Does Willis smoke? No, never. Mac was right, Jack. She was poisoned. By her own cigarettes. I found that at the back of Willis Jones' desk. The packet's a match for the cigarette you found near the victim's body. Except that cigarette was harmless. The cigarette found in the packet contained ricin. Blood samples have confirmed it - Ricinus communis. From castor oil? From the beans of the castor seed plant, to be exact. The oil itself isn't poisonous. I'm impressed you're even close. The Americans and British were experimenting with chemical weapons towards the end of the war, until the Hague Convention banned them. ~ Ricin's deadly. ~ Hmm, just a few grains. Particularly if inhaled. But this hasn't been touched. The killer must have laced other cigarettes in the packet. Doesn't work fast. It can take days. Perfect way to be absent at the time of death. It's for you, Inspector. Your constable seems to have a lead on our mystery woman. Virginia Forbes went missing from Claremont six years ago. Six years? Worked as a nurse at the military hospital. Might explain the bandage in her handbag. Might explain more than that. James was transferred to Melbourne from the Claremont Airbase in 1923. That must've been where James and Virginia met. But if what you're telling me about James is true, whatever happened between them wasn't romantic. You can see now why Compton needs to be discreet. No, I don't see. A woman is dead and he's asking you to withhold information from me. If he won't cooperate with the police, I'll go over his head. You seem determined to make this a personal matter. And you seem determined to make it a military one. I don't understand why you have to dance to his tune. Ahem. Excuse me, Miss Fisher. Mr Butler just called to let you know that Group Captain Compton would like to see you, urgently. Thank you, Hugh. I dance to no-one's tune, Jack. Shandy for the lady. Bert, I can't speak with you. Go, please. Why not? That lady, your boss - Comrade Higgins says she's with the police. He thinks I say bad things about him. What? You only told the truth. I'll set him straight. No, Bert, please. There are things you do not know. That bastard Higgins! You'll be next! Some papers went missing three nights ago from here, from the Party. Nobody knows who to trust. Well, Higgins can trust you. I'll tell him that. Does it matter? This woman, if she is dead, she is dead. ~ I don't want trouble. ~ No trouble. Just a word. Or two. Listen to me, Higgins. It's one thing sorting out some pansy right-winger's politics, but there's no need to touch a lady. ~ No, please! ~ Oi, Bert! ~ Miss Fyodorov needs to appreciate... ~ She needs you to leave her alone. ~ Calm down, Bert. ~ Please. You could lose your Party membership for this, Johnson. You could lose an entire set of choppers if you go near her again! Stop! Or I tell everyone what you do. ~ Come on, love. ~ You just quit. Krest'yanin. ~ What did she just say? ~ It's Russian for 'bastard'. No, it's Russian for 'peasant'. Don't worry, we'll find you another job. Plenty of places will be lucky to have someone like you. Thank you, Bert, but... I have some things at the Club I must get. ~ First thing tomorrow. ~ Then I must go far away from here. I am illegal. I have no passport. Miss Fisher will sort that. She's got friends in the police force. ~ You can trust her. ~ I trust no-one. Except you. Greaves tells me you found evidence in Willis's desk. ~ A packet of cigarettes. ~ Willis doesn't smoke. Well, that's what made me curious. They match the cigarette found beside Virginia Forbes' body. Our victim has a name now. Well, your inspector will be happy with that. Don't you start, Compton. You two can squabble over demarcation. I'm interested in the big picture. Hmm, and how does Jack fit into your picture? He's not your usual... style. I don't have a usual style. I think I'm admirably versatile. Ah, so I am right about Jack. Too much ballast for lift-off. ~ Yours or his? ~ Probably both. Tempt you with a drink? Nothing like a drop of brandy at 10,000 feet to warm the heart. Is that what you're up to? Remember Madagascar? God, yes. How could I forget? It's a miracle we survived that landing. And then the cyclone raged for days. Nothing to do but... sit it out. Though we did manage to think of a few other things. Ah, the good old days. How I've missed the thrill of them. There must be a connection between the three of them. If it wasn't romantic, what was it? Not sure what a red-ragger would have in common with a couple of RAAF pilots, Sir. Which suggests their rendezvous were clandestine, but it wasn't a very private place to meet. There was an old sentry box just inside the base. ~ Bring the car round, Collins. ~ Sir. Flight lieutenant. These have to be James Manning's. Condy's crystals. Antiseptic? Why would he take his clothes off out here? Oh. Get to the car. Go, go! Take those! Go that way. Go, go! Hey, you! These sentries will fire, Constable Put your hands above your head. ~ Now. ~ Get in the car, Hugh. ~ Drop your weapon. ~ Don't shoot! Don't shoot. Don't shoot! Hold your positions, men! Inspector Robinson, this is trespass! We were just leaving. Not with military property you're not. Take it up with the Chief Commissioner. Get to the car, Collins! Stand down, men. Jack, wait! We were just reminiscing! Where did you find those? And what on earth...? It's a police matter, Miss Fisher. It's none of your concern. You keep those eyes turned skyward. Eyes turned skyward? That's it, the note by Virginia Forbes' body. The love letter is a quote from Leonardo da Vinci. I think I might have found it. Is this it? 'Once you've tasted flight you will...' Yes! 'Once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been and there you will always long to return.' How lovely. ~ A snifter, Miss. ~ Desperately. Like Mr Greaves said, like being in heaven. Except poor Leonardo never got to fly. Do you think Virginia Forbes could have been an aviatrix? That, my dear Dot, is a very good question. Mr Butler, get me a couple of small flat cushions and, Dot, a long bandage from the medicine cabinet. I'll meet you upstairs in my smalls. Straight as a celery stick, Miss. Well, e-except for your... Oh. Nothing a De Beauvoir's bandeau wouldn't fix. I should have picked up on her face being so heavily powdered. And this will explain the Condy's crystals, Inspector. A strong solution will both darken and roughen the skin. Meet Flight Lieutenant James Manning, also known as Virginia Forbes. She swore she'd find a way to join the Air Force and she did. By assuming the identity of Flight Lieutenant James Manning, who was admitted to the Perth hospital where Virginia was nursing. The real James Manning was committed to a sanatorium, but Ginny knew he'd been about to be taking up a posting in Melbourne. So she stole his identity papers and doctored the medical report to say he was fit for duty. You got to admire her ingenuity. And an exceptional aviatrix by all accounts. Goggles and God help you. That was Ginny. Did you know about her... forays into the Communist Party? I knew she was fired up and that she suspected someone in the unions. She said she had found out who was behind the sabotage. ~ Any names? ~ No. But she said she befriended someone at the Club and was paying them to find her proof. A Russian girl. She promised me she would stop as soon as she'd found it. We know you were with her when she died. She came back frantic... that night. She... was beside herself. She was sweating. She... She couldn't breathe. T-there was no time to go for any help. She died in my arms. So you removed anything that might identify her and left her there. What were you doing with the cigarette packet? I found it in your office. I don't know... I... I didn't know what to make of how she'd died. Did you know they were poisoned? No, I had no idea. Thank you. That will be all. We may need to speak with you again. We need to hold on to that. He may be lying. Rupert Higgins could have doctored the cigarette. Whether Willis murdered Ginny with these or not, why would he hold on to this? And why is he still so interested in it? We may need a Russian to help us find out. Don't reckon they'll be happy to see any of us back in there. How important is this bag anyway? I must have it! It is sentimental. Behind the counter there is a loose floorboard. You just... He knows, love. You heard her. You can't just leave after this. Let me help you. ~ There is one way. ~ Well, name it. Anything. I become a new person, a new name. With you, Bert. Tatiana Fyodorov, will you be my wife? ~ No! ~ Come back with the bag. My bag! What's in that bloody bag? Now, perhaps you'd like to tell us who you really are. This passport's a fake. It's a good one, but a fake. You told me you didn't have one. I am Tatiana Krasnaya. ~ When did you come to Australia? ~ After the Revolution. How well did you know Ginny? She saw me at the Club, tearing one of Higgins' pamphlets. So she tells me she knows they are lies too. And I tell her everything. About Russia. About my brothers and sisters, all killed in the Revolution. Higgins says they are criminals, but they are only children. Virginia asked you to do a lot more than just her sewing, didn't she, Tatiana? You made a deal. She said she would save me if I steal from Higgins what she wants. ~ Report to the Comintern. ~ Yes. She will tell me the day to fly me to somewhere safe, to a new life, she promised me. This outlines plans for further sabotage at the RAAF air show this Saturday. This is definitely the safest place for you right now, Miss Krasnaya, but I need your help. I speak a lot more Russian than I can read. Our meeting place. .. is 'Tuesday, four o'clock'. That's today. And 'zhar-ptitsa' is 'firebird'. The Russian equivalent of the phoenix. I need to make an urgent phone call to stop an act of treason. Krasnaya. What kind of name is that? My father was General Anton Krasny. He was an advisor to the White Army against the Bolsheviks. So that cock-and-bull story about you being illegal and having to get married was just a con job. You're a bloody White Russian. Bert, I was a child, I knew nothing. I thought I would be safe with you. You are a good man, Bert. You are the kind of man any woman would come to love. Willis must have known, that's why he kept the cigarette packet. Those map coordinates, 14-G-3. Here. The Gallery Park airfield. Flying off into the wild blue yonder seems more appealing than facing a court martial for accessory to fraud. Or perhaps honouring his dying lover's last wish. This report isn't signed. There's no proof Higgins was behind the sabotage. Which is why Tatiana needs to keep that rendezvous with Willis this afternoon, and why Rupert Higgins needs to find out about it. A stakeout? Preferably with full cooperation from the Air Force. I'll leave that part to you. ~ We better move fast. ~ As always. I'll put out word at the European Club. G'day, gents. Got a special tip for Rupert Higgins. ~ Can you pass it on for me? ~ Will do. I think that's everything, Miss. Your pistol's been repaired and there's a supply of ammunition, should you require it. Thank you, Mr B. Are you sure I can't do anything else, Miss? No, thank you, Dot. I know how terrified you are of leaving the ground. And I would never forgive myself if anything happened to you. I wish I felt the same way about flying as Mr Greaves does. He thinks flying's like being in heaven. He was stuck in a factory in Avonmouth for the whole war. Avonmouth, where they made mustard gas during the war. The CWS? Chemical Weapons Services, that's right. This is highly unorthodox, Inspector - police and Air Force joint manoeuvres. We know who's manoeuvred us, don't we, Captain? Yes. Well, she always was a wild child. I can see the taxi cab, Sir. How you doin' there, Miss Krasnaya? Could not pick the difference. Unless someone asked me to hem their trousers. ~ Dot, you're in charge. ~ Yes, Miss. Here comes Willis now, right on time. I told the Air Vice-Marshal we were doing extraordinary manoeuvres. With Miss Fisher involved, I'm sure we can be guaranteed of that. You think Higgins got the message, Sir? We'll soon find out. ~ Wish me luck. ~ Udachi. Is this plan gonna work? We have to wait for them to make the first move. There's a black motor car approaching. Get ready. They're right behind you. Get down! There's another gunman. Let's go. Go! Is Miss Fisher alright? Yeah, yeah, they missed her. Take cover, Collins. Got him, Miss. Cec, give us a hand! Easy, mate. ~ Bert! ~ Yeah. Drop it! Get on the ground! On the ground! Get on the ground! I'll catch him, Miss Fisher! Get away! Happy now you've caught another red for the government? You won't be locked up for your politics, Higgins. You'll be locked up because you're a murderous thug. How's Squadron Leader Jones doing? Have you finished with him? Not yet, Captain. We just need a statement about Rupert Higgins and the relationship he was having with a woman who was posing as James Manning. I assume you'll charge Higgins with murder. The Air Force will most certainly be pressing charges of sabotage. A woman? James was a woman? Virginia Forbes. And Rupert Higgins was guilty on many fronts. But he didn't murder her. Did he, Mr Greaves? Ricin-coated bullets, produced experimentally at Avonmouth factory where you worked during the war. Later banned and yet there they were, sitting in your locker. I... I didn't know he was a woman. And yet you laced his cigarettes knowing he would take days to die, and there are enough enemies at play for you to hide behind. Well, I thought he was after Willis. Everybody thought that. Even you. But you turned a blind eye, even let him be the air show ace, someone like that, someone so... depraved. Forget the union. Manning was going to bring down the RAAF all on his own. Somebody had to do something. Ginny knew it was dangerous... .. impersonating an officer. But it was the only way she could see. When I tried to warn her off the unions, she said she had no choice. She would do anything for the Air Force. Group Captain Compton ordered her to find out the truth and she said she was going to see it through. And she did. I think she loved me. But she loved flying more. I thought you said pursuing the union was James Manning's idea. It was originally. Then I ordered him to follow through with it. Why did you not tell me? I couldn't be seen to condone what James was doing. He was spying. And you were keeping up appearances... with me. Well, I'm not in Madagascar anymore. I have... responsibilities. What a shame. ~ Dotty. ~ Hugh. ~ I, um... ~ Um, I... I want you to know that I only said I was going up in a plane because you didn't think I could. Well, I'm still glad you didn't. But if Miss Fisher wanted me to, I would have. Even if I screamed the whole way or shut my eyes or fainted before we even left the ground... I know... I... I know. Because you're brave. And you're smart. I never would've found Claremont without your help. Y-you're smart and you're beautiful and you're brave and... .. sometimes it scares me to death. I just want to be the one to choose what I do. It's my job. Well, I guess I'm going to have to find a way of being brave about that too. So..... what about... .. Saturday, 14th September 1929? It sounds perfect. Two arrests in one day - murder and treason. This calls for a celebration. Well, I still have a report to write for the Chief Commissioner about a missing Russian emigre due to give evidence at Rupert Higgins' trial. Excuse me, Miss Fisher. Albert has telephoned. He said that... that the caviar has arrived. Thank you, Mr B. So if the 'caviar' is who I think it is, where is it being sent to? Tasmania? So what do I tell my chief? You can tell him that the Air Force doesn't know either. That's some consolation. Even though Compton saved my life. ~ Literally? ~ Ten years ago. He had a chute and he could have bailed, but... he chose to crash-land the plane between two mountains and a ravine. And we both survived. Well, no doubt you have more dashing heroes in your past. If there weren't I wouldn't be here. To heroes, then. And to the one as yet unsung hero who has saved me over and over again. It's Nonna Louisa. I think somebody kill her! I can't help feeling I'm missing half of this conversation. And I'm happy to keep it that way, Miss Fisher. ~ Did you just say Camorra? ~ It's an old Italian secret society. Concetta. She's an old friend. Something will be done. You have no idea how ruthless these people can be! You tell everybody here what you done! You killed Nonna Luisa! Previously on Allegiance... Somehow we need to alert the task force that the operative in charge of Black Dagger is on his way here. We plant a letter for the task force to find. Nothing. It wasn't there, the file. I opened the JPEG. It was empty. If it's gone, that's because someone went in and erased it. We did an operation recently overseas. There was a particular officer for a period of time who was unaccounted for. So it's the boy genius you took under your wing. Alex O'Connor. Anything you move, put back exactly as it was. He notices everything. I've been lying to you. We need to talk. Don't. Oh, my God, Michelle. Mich... Michelle. You are being framed for her murder... that's what is going on. And you need to listen to me very carefully about what happens next. You're still awake. So are you. - You should've tried to sleep. - Mm. At least for a few hours. I tried, but my mind won't shut off, you know. - I'll put on some tea. - Okay. Things have been moving so fast. I can't remember the last time I had a moment to stop. I tried to lie down, but all I could do was think about the last 20 years, about the life that we made. It all just seems so far away, like some... dream we sold ourselves, and now we are awake. Well, maybe it was a fantasy, but we were happy. We were selfish. We brought Sarah into a world where she will never be safe. Alex, we turned Alex into a criminal. Natalie... at least Natalie had the sense to leave. Do you know the first thought that came into my head when Victor showed up at our door? "What took so long?" I knew the SVR would come back someday. Oh, my God. We got him. Mark. I know who it is. I know him. Hello? I sent you an email. Check it. Is that the man that you saw in Rome? Yes. Do you know the name Oscar Christoph? We studied him at the Kent School. Operative for hire, assassin. Made his name during the '81 coup in Bangladesh. Suspected of being involved in at least 70 acts of political violence and terrorism before his death in Myanmar in 1994. He was one of the most wanted men in the world. That's him. Christoph. He's dead. He's not. I got to call you back. O'Connor. Alex, this is Special Agent Faber. Listen carefully. You've been set up for murder. Go to the window. If you allow them to arrest you, you'll end up in a 7x10 foot prison cell at ADX supermax in Florence, Colorado. You will spend 23 hours a day there every day for the rest of your life. Why are you telling me this? Because I think I know who the mole is in the task force. What do I do? Run. _ We got something. Whoever killed Michelle dialed 911 across from her apartment on 156th street. Natalie came through. She hacked into Telecom's database. We need to find surveillance cameras on this corner. Not "we," you can't go anywhere near that crime scene, Alex. You have to go about your daily routines and just act normal, okay? I'm trying. Sam, he... he knows something's wrong, that I lied, I can feel it. Alex, until we know who this mole is, you have to try to stay strong and... Hope I'm not arrested. Yes. Listen, why don't you go back to the hotel and try to get some sleep, okay? A quantum implant? How the hell did you get it on the computer? You went into his hotel room? All above board, sanctioned by headquarters and DOJ. Why go around me on this? I didn't. Alex's laptop is CIA property. Langley wanted to keep it inside until there was proof of wrongdoing. So you found something? Alex illegally accessed FinCEN using FBI credentials. Michelle Prado's credentials. Anything else? No. What if the evidence you found on his computer was planted? Why would you think that? Because it's the only thing you found. If Alex was the leak, there'd be more. There's always more. He broke the law, Jason. I suspect she discovered the deceit, she confronted him, and he killed her. You know better than to act on suspicion alone. This isn't suspicion. This is evidence of a crime. It's FBI's territory. That's why I'm telling you. But not evidence that Alex O'Connor is the mole. You really think he's capable of pulling off deception at that level? Of killing Michelle? That's what I plan on asking him. We're bringing him in tonight. Not like you, rushing. Why not leave him in play a little longer? Because there is no more time. Black Dagger could happen at any minute, and I think Alex O'Connor knows more about it than we do. Wow. It's... wow. So much light. It's too much light. We need blinds. This is amazing. I've never lived near a lake before. So many trees. So many places to hide. You're thinking about sight lines, aren't you? I'm thinking about security. We need multiple layers. Motion detectors, infrared cameras, proximity alarms. It would be wise to stash a weapon out there somewhere. You're serious? When the Rezident discovers I'm missing, he's going to come after us. _ _ _ I want to enjoy it. I want to cook breakfast for you. I want to walk around naked and watch movies. We covered our tracks well. Nobody knows who or where we are. We're okay. If we can't let go of fear, they win. If they find us and kill us, we lose. _ _ _ _ Recently, I obtained authorization to put a surveillance device on Alex O'Connor's laptop. Information gathered from that action reveals that Alex illegally accessed classified files from Special Agent Prado up until the night she disappeared. We're bringing him in. I know many of you were close with Michelle, so if any of you feel you cannot put aside personal feelings to execute this raid, I understand. For everybody else, let's nail him to a cross. I can help you. What do I do? Run. They're in the elevator. They're also coming up the south staircase. There's an unmarked maintenance stairwell just past the ice machine. Move. - It's this way. - Yes, sir. Around the corner. It's warm. He's still in the building. Faster, you were almost caught. Are you watching me? I'm looking at blueprints, Alex. The stairwell will bring you to the receptionist's desk. No receptionist on duty. Behind the desk are monitors, security feeds. Use them as your eyes. There's a door across the lobby you need to get to. You just need to get past the agents posted there. - How many agents? - Two, maybe three tops. What? That's... that's crazy. That's the only shot you have. Hurry. We'll sweep the ballroom. Copy that. I'll stay on the exit. They're covering all the exits. Not all of them. I took care of that for you. Just get to the door at the far end of the lobby and go out to the loading dock. Four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight forward, seven back. Eight forward, seven. Eight forward, seven back. Eight forward, seven, five. Damn it. There. Loading dock. There's a walkway across the street. Move quickly. Keep walking, Alex. Agent Faber, what's going on? It's Sam. He's the mole. We're safe here for a few hours. My brother-in-law bought it in foreclosure. He's turning it into luxury condos. Brooklyn, right? Come inside. It's a little warmer. Oof. Are you sure about Sam? You're never sure. But I've known the man 23 years. His behavior is... off. How? Started when you came back from Rome. He reached out to ask for my advice as a friend. He implied you were dirty, but he was vague. I think he was planting suspicion, softening me up, so I'd accept the narrative about you he was creating. Negative one. Michelle disappears, and Sam goes behind my back for a warrant to access your computer. Why? To plant evidence to lead the task force to conclude that you're the mole. He was covering his tracks, Alex. Alex, I need you to be completely honest with me about Michelle. I-I didn't hurt her. I-I never would. I know you wouldn't. I don't see it in you. Here. Have a seat. But you did use her login codes to access an FBI database. Why? Hmm? Sam wouldn't murder a federal agent for no reason. It's enormous exposure. Had to be reason enough to justify the risk. Here's my theory. Whatever Michelle knew came from you, right? You uncovered something, and it was big. For some reason, you couldn't come directly into the task force with it, so you confided in Michelle. You trusted her. But the information made her nervous, uneasy. So she turned to the one person inside the task force she could trust, Sam. And it got her killed. I'm sorry, Alex. Oscar Christoph. The man who helped mastermind the Beirut barracks bombing in '83? And took down the President of Pakistan's jet in '88. Yes. Christoph is dead, Alex. Died in an helicopter crash in Myanmar, what, 20 years ago. This was taken two days ago. Christoph's in New York. He's the operative who's going to carry out Black Dagger. That's what I told Michelle. I told her about Christoph. Why couldn't you walk it in? 'Cause there's a mole inside the task force and I didn't have that picture, solid evidence yet. And you're protecting a source, hmm? Send me the picture. I'll put it through Homeland Security. Oh, boy. Ray. Jason Faber. Are you sitting down? You really think we can make up for all the things that we've done? Yes, I do. We're going to clear Alex. We're going to get out with Sarah. We're going to run. We tried that once. We didn't get very far. We know so much more right now. Where would we even go? Ilha Grande. The summer we spent there with Sarah, she was happy. We were happy. We go somewhere we've been before, they track us in a second. Katya, please, don't give up. Not now. Okay. Now let's ID the bastard who framed our son. Hard drive should be under the front desk. DHS has the picture. 20 minutes, it'll be on the wall of every law-enforcement office in the country. That's not how it works. First the DHS secretary has to sign... The point is, Alex, it's out there. Christoph will soon be the most wanted man in America. I need to know how you came upon this information. Give me a name. I gave you a picture of Oscar Christoph in New York City. That's... - That's not enough? - No. No, it's not. You're going to have to explain yourself to the directors of the FBI, the CIA... So I will. No. You're not understanding, Alex, your name is mud. Sam made sure of that. He'll discredit the picture and every bit of intelligence coming from you as disinformation. I need it sourced and corroborated, or we lose precious time. Whoever helped you, Alex, I can recommend they be granted asylum. You don't have that authority. I have influence. You got to open up to me, Alex. I acted alone. Victor. There's no one out there. Then why do I feel so many eyes on me? The raccoons won't kill you, babe. Come to bed. I understand why you're worried. They may come for us. If they do, I want to die happy, rather than living every day believing there's no escape. I'm done being afraid. I love you, Natalie. _ Now come to bed. You know the irony? Surrounded by all this calm... I miss the madness. Come on, Alex, come on. You got to level with me. How'd you get onto Christoph? Who fed you Intel? How I developed the lead on Christoph is... is not as important as stopping him. And I acted alone. You couldn't have. You're protecting someone, maybe for good reason, but you're facing treason. You're being set up for murder, and I'm putting my ass and career on the line to help you. Because you know I'm not the mole. If I can't prove it, I'm screwed. And if Black Dagger happens while a bunch of desk jockeys are busy arguing about your credibility, we're all screwed. I appreciate your help, Agent Faber. I really do, but I... I can't tell you anything more. Stopping the attack was my sole focus, and we've done that by alerting the DHS. As soon as the SVR realizes that American intelligence has made Christoph, they'll call Black Dagger off. That's... That's all I ever wanted. I'd like to turn myself in to the NYPD. They'll hold me for a day, keep me away from the task force. To buy time for your source to get out of the country. Yes. Okay. We'll do it your way. You didn't call anyone at Homeland Security, did you? You helped me escape from the hotel to get me away from the FBI. You brought me here to find out who else knows about Christoph, not to stop Black Dagger, but to make sure it happens. You're the mole. You killed Michelle. It's a cold world, Alex. So, what have you found? Several encrypted money transfers from Victor's account into a bank in Finland. Years ago. He's been planning this. What's the closest rezidentura to Newfoundland? Montreal? Make the call. Find Victor. Stupid. - How did I not see it? - Don't feel bad, Alex. I've been doing this for 30 years. Why betray your own country? "Betray" is a strong word. Our country betrays each of us every day, Alex. D.C. is a cesspool of greedy vampires who Borg with Wall Street to feed off the people. The State isn't your friend, Alex. The State turns cops into tax agents who'd choke a man to death on the streets of New York for trying to skirt cigarette levies. The State is organized violence and force, nothing more. What exactly have I betrayed? The American people. Wow. A true believer. I didn't think your kind still existed. You're lying to yourself. Your betrayal has nothing to do with higher value. What's it got to do with? It's about greed. It's about money. You killed Michelle for money. No. I spy for money. I killed Michelle because you told her things she had no business knowing. I didn't want to kill her. You forced me to. You killed Michelle. Now, here's my problem. The reason I can't put a bullet in your head is because you scrubbed her apartment, and disposed of the body, and that means at least one other person out there knows exactly what you know, and that's a threat to me and my employer. And that means we need to have... a different sort of conversation. Alex, who helped you clean the apartment? That's level one of pain. Timur here can take you all the way to ten. But no, wait I think you'd be dead by ten, right? Usually eight. Sam. Yeah. Oh, now? All right, well, let me... let me throw some clothes on, unless you want to see me in my Jockeys. All right, yeah. I'll be there, I'll be there. Okay, yeah. Bye. Sam just bought you some time. Hit him with the full dose. Unfortunately, no matter what, this ends badly for you, Alex. But... the way to the end is what matters. Shh. It can hurt a lot. Or not at all. It's up to you. Agh. There's still no answer. This isn't like Alex. Why hasn't he called back? What if they've arrested him? Even if they have, we finally got our hands on something that could clear his name. The exact moment the 911 call was placed. That's him. That's the guy that made the 911 call. That's the guy that murdered Michelle. We have to find him. Mr. and Mrs. O'Connor? Yes. Special Agent William Brock, with the FBI. This is Sam Luttrell, he's a civilian working with us. Sorry to drop by unannounced at this hour. Do you work with Alex? That's right. Did something happen to him? It's best if we talk inside, ma'am. Mrs. O'Connor, is it okay if we come in? Have you spoken to Alex today? Earlier. My wife did. He jumped off the phone, and hasn't called back. Where is Alex? Is he okay? We don't know where he is. That's why we're here. Does Alex have any friends nearby, a girlfriend? No. He just moved from DC. We're all he has. You're lying. You're here because he's dead. He's dead. Isn't he? In times like these our minds go to the darkest places. No reason to believe the worst. Excuse me. I need a minute. - What the hell are you doing? - That man killed our son, and I'm going to put a bullet in his head. No. Try to stay calm. You want me to be calmed? We don't even know if Alex is dead. You want me to be calm with that man in our house? I want you to act... calm. If he's alive, we still have a chance to save him. - How? - We track Faber. We'd track an FBI agent who is an SVR mole. He'd make our tail in a second. Look, I took this out of his jacket. I go upstairs, and put a tracker in it. I come back downstairs, and we do all their questions. We're as helpful as possible. This is our only chance. Please. Put the gun away, Katya. We will make him pay for what he's done. Just not yet. I need you to help me. I need you to help me get through this. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I apologize. It's a lot to process. Your only son is missing. We understand. He speaks so highly of everyone he works with. He won't tell us much, but... he learned more in two months with you than he did in two years of training. That makes me worried about what they're teaching those kids, then. Mrs. O'Connor... Alex trusts us. Can you help us find him? I don't know where he is. That's the truth. Well, if he does call, and I'm sure he will, have him call us. Call me. I'll do everything I can to get him home safe, I promise you. So you believe that he's alive, then? Yes, I do. We could only imagine how difficult this is for you. We appreciate that. So tell us, how could we help you find our son? - They don't know where he is. - Agreed. The mother's fear was genuine, pupils dilated, carotid going a mile a minute. They're in the dark too. I told you he's the best. If only you weren't so aware of it. Are you heading back to the office? I'm going to go grab a shower. Then I'll be in. _ _ _ You are going to lose the battle, in here. I want to make this easier for you. Pain is my business. I know it like a mother knows her child. I nurture pain. I help it grow. These hands, they have turned stronger men into squealing pigs who would turn in their own children. Save yourself the pain. Just tell the man what he wants to know. Your family will be spared, and your death will be quick. Alex, stay quiet. How... How did you get... It doesn't matter. There are two men outside. Can you walk? You're not really here. I'm alone in here. Yes, baby, you are all alone. Those handcuffs aren't coming off. We can't help you. We put you here, and we can't get you out. It's not your fault. You and Dad did all you could to get out. You need to get them to remove the cuffs. They will never do that. They will, if they believe that you're dying. Who's that you're talking to, Alex? Mm? Is that your parents? Mark and Katya? What did you do to them? Nothing... yet. Poor Katya. She thinks you're dead, she's already grieving. Ah, a mother's intuition is amazing. Alex. Who else knows about Oscar Christoph? Who helped you clean the apartment, Alex? Come on, talk to me. Talk to me. Come on, kid. Tell me. Who helped you clean the apartment? What are you doing here? I'm here to help, Alex. You need to give them something. I won't give them my family. So give them me. If they find you, they find Natalie. The SVR has already discovered I'm missing by now. Giving Faber my name will make no difference. No. Alex... Natalie and I can take care of ourselves. They're preparing another syringe, Alex. This one will not only make you talk. This one will kill you. If your plan of escape is going to work, you need more time. Buy that time with my name, Alex. I can't. I won't tell him that, Victor. They'll kill you. Let's talk about Victor. Let's talk about Victor. He told me about Christoph. Well, that's... that's wonderful. Is he American? Mm-mm. Is he... Russian? - Russian. - He's Russian. Of course he's Russian. Does he operate in New York? - He did. - Did? Give me his full name, Alex, come on. You'll kill him. No, no, I won't kill him, Alex. The SVR will. Come on, Alex, his full name. Victor. Victor. Go to hell. We were doing so well. Mm. Unh. Now you'll talk. Dead men don't talk, Agent Faber. Damn it, where's your kit? - Where's your kit? ! - Toolbox, in the other room. Do not let him bleed out. Alex, Alex. You're not very smart. Kill him now! I'm gonna find Alex. Faber! Oh, God. Oh, God, no. Oh, God. Alex, stay conscious. Alex. Help is here. Stay conscious, stay conscious. You're here now, aren't you? I am here. I'm real, and we're getting you out of here. Hold on to me. Hold on. How did they find you? Because you failed to mention his parents are assets, and they got a tracker in my pen. SVR compartmentalizes information, you know that. What I know is, your compartmentalization almost got me killed. - Timur... - Dead. Katya and Mark killed your men like the pros they are. Alex escaped with them, bleeding out. But alive for the moment. Who's Victor? I think he's one of yours. What makes you say that? Got his name out of Alex. Victor put Alex in Christoph's trail. Who else has seen this? The whole O'Connor family, I imagine. They'll send it to the task force. If I were you, I'd call off whatever the hell you're planning. That isn't necessary. The O'Connors are on the run. Alex has been branded a traitor. We'll flood the task force, so it doesn't lead to another operatives, which we'll make sure they know is actually SVR disinformation. Even if Christoph's picture gets into the task force, it'll be discredited, along with the others. Find the O'Connors. And Victor. _ How much blood has he lost? - A lot. - Take this, take this. Did you tell them anything, Alex? We need to know. Doesn't matter. Faber saw us, SVR, the task force, everyone. We can't go home, we can't go to the hospital. We're on our own now, Katya. - Sarah. - We'll get to her first. Hang on, Alex. Hang on!

Probably from breathing the bad air down there. ya know? about mole monsters? I–I think you're clear on that. I'm grateful. I want to thank you all for coming on down here then– right? Yeah? no. I'm just gonna ride with him. Jane's gonna meet us down there. I'll see you later. I brought your Walkman. a runaway? What else? Kid had the tunnel set up pretty well. Except for the air.

Three-forty-one's empty if you'd like to check it out. thank you. mate. How many guards? Ten. Maybe twelve. Scamper like the rest when the tunnels go. make sure those valves are all the way open. How are they holding the gas? Well enough to panic five or ten city blocks. Providing some Jacks from maintenance don't set off another tunnel on their own. We should be okay as long as there are no more surprises like that bloody kid. but don't bother checkin' it out with juvie hall or foster homes. I made it up. Zack?

I can tell when a kid's kicking. we gotta do something. are you okay? couldn't be better. what was that? Great. I finally isolated the gas that's in those tunnels. What is it? Methane. Girls? How'd you like to crash a party? Thank you. miss? Yes? Your invitation. Do you mean we were supposed to bring them? How gauche. Celebrities. We were simply interested in the technology. come here and take a look at this. Let's take a look at this goblet. This goblet alone is worth over six thousand dollars. Mr. Buchre would know. he's not here. He jus–he keeps disappearing. if you're doing all of this just for the hors d'oeuvres. this could be an emergency. I know– ya know? it's not gonna be that snobby. I know what's going on at these places. bud? the service entrance is around the back. I don't think you understand. We're– Psst! Come on! these people need us. good. I'm so glad you're here. The leaky toilet's in the second-floor men's room. Hayes. Jane. okay? is that you? we need some more sandwiches here. Thank you. but isn't that pushing it a bit? psst! What? Come on. What? What is it? You're not gonna believe this. I couldn't find Richard anywhere– Thanks. But I did see that wannabe that was flirting with Johnny B. they're terrific. The ones with the little red balls on top. I don't like caviar. Don't you think it's a little strange that she's here? What caviar? The little balls on top of that are red. it'll be all right. Salmon caviar's red. El. They use 'em as bait. Wha–what're–what're these little rice cakes with the yellow gooey stuff on top? What is that? There you are. I've been looking all over for you. The bathroom is– It's a long story Hayes? Richard. Methane? I told the bartenders only to serve– Richard. Methane. It's a gas. A what? It's a flammable gas. Do ya remember what happened in the Fairfax district? boom! The whole thing went. That was methane? the concentration under here could be higher than Fairfax was. This is something we should report right away. and now methane. Who the hell are you? Glo: He wasn't home. I talked to one of the guys in the band. Yeah? he went into the tunnels looking for that girl. Looking for Gina. if he even sparks– Don't tell me! Bukowski. You know 'im? what's he doing here? What are we going to do with him? That's the question. Leave him. but killing' a fella... Syl? Thirty million dollars. Is he worth it? Let's just finish what we came here to do. Right. and then get out of here. Gina! we've been looking all over for you. look. So I don't have an invitation. You wanna throw me out? we're friends of Johnny B. fast It's very dangerous for him to be down there. Unh-uh. You are talking to the wrong person. you've gotta understand what we're trying to tell ya here. too. but we have a feeling there are more of you. Wha? Who are you? Where's Gina? The air's better in here. You'll be okay. You're the guy in the band that plays in that garage on Hudson. Gina took me last week to listen to ya. You're good. Thanks. Wher–do ya know where she is? I think. they're all swimming around in a sea of methane down there. With a human sparkler. one spark from Johnny B and we're talkin' the Fourth of July here! Those guys in masks! spraying for cockroaches or something. Whoa! What guys in masks? Does she live here? you know? Mama Gina. Yeah. it's a lot better than livin' on the street. Or where the County put us. And that kid we pulled out this morning? Zack? Is he okay? We wondered what happened to 'im. he's fine. we won't be if we stay here very much longer. just forget about gettin' out. but we can't get far enough through the tunnels. so we just figured we'd ride it out. I don't think that's a very good idea. I can feel the gas comin' in please. Right this way. I–I found him. Here he is. Richard's filled me in on this methane stuff and I think it's ridiculous. You're making a big deal out of nothing. You always have methane under the city. Methane that's being pumped in? What? bleeding tanks into the tunnels. They're probably just city employees. El: Are you willing to take that chance? and someone – or something – sparks Boom! Boom? - Boom! - Boom! Al: Alright. Wait a minute. let's at least do it right and call the professionals. Would ya feel better if I called the fire department and had them check it out? That's a start. Good. Isn't he terrific? He's terrific. methane rises. I'll be back with some help as soon as I can. man. It's eight blocks to the nearest grate. Watch me. you're gonna stay right here until the authorities arrive. Do you understand? an–and some of the ones with the little squiggly Spam stuff on top. That's liver. Pâté. there are hundreds of tunnels down there. anyway? With Gina. where'd she go? Goon: They told you to call the fire department? That's great! Are you ready? we're ready. Will you be around soon? Al: I'm leaving right now. They'll make the big bang in... ten minutes? Right. Gina! They told me you were down here. I didn't believe 'em. we gotta get out of here. I got some people I gotta see. I was just there. You'll never make it. there's no air. We gotta get help. I don't need help. What are you so afraid of? you can't live your life solo. okay? they start screwing' up your life. I'm not–I'm not talkin' about a relationship here. I'm talkin' about getting me out of this tunnel so I can get some help for your friends. but it doesn't for me. Forget it. I don't need help either. I gotta get them out of there. Help me. Richard. The tunnel entrance in the basement's filled with gas. We'll say we got a big firecracker. what can I say? ! How'm I gonna break it to everyone? Everybody get outta here! There's gonna be an explosion! Get out! Richard. we gotta go back. You are not going anywhere. we gotta do something. We gotta get 'em outta there. Okay. I'll take ya. Blasting caps. Timers. I found 'em. There hafta be more. Does yours say the same as mine? Five and a half minutes. if–if you would. I'm–we're gonna do this again. everybody hurry right along. you can't take another trip down there. Look at you. let's go. Come on Gina B-Man. Come on. I'm fine. Gimme a mask. come on. Here's to the end of an otherwise fabulous career. fast. Gina: Here. there's no time. Gina. is there any kind of large opening out of these tunnels? serve as a safety valve if it explodes. not very big. there's a fountain! About a couple hundred yards from here. it's always locked up tight. Which way? You won't have time. Which way? Down that tunnel. okay? We're gonna check out the fountain. we're running out of time. I–I gotta find my bag. Go on. Al: The explosion'll take out the tunnels and bring real fire trucks so you'll blend right in. We go straight for the treasure? no looking around. And the alarm system will get knocked out? Sure. mate. Piece o' cake. shake it up! This is it. This has to be the fountain entrance that Gina was talking about. Locked! They're always locked! There's no hole? ! I thought we needed a hole? ! that would just leave the floor of the fountain. And that oughta come off like a piece of paper when the thing explodes. El? El: I don't think we're gonna live long enough to make the calculations Maybe. we gotta get inside. Can you do it? I think I can fit through here. My clothes are in the lunchbox. Here ya are. Here goes. Hit it. the methane'll blow right through the fountain. It's the course of least resistance. what moves these doors? What? What moves these doors? I'm still lookin'. we're getting a little short– El. A couple of big motors – too big for me to start. The best I can do is short the locks. Whoa! we're almost there. where's Gina? Lookin' for her bag. You guys go ahead. let's get outta here. it won't move. They're frozen. Glo. don't give up now. okay? Let's give it a try. One more. Come on. they're going. Billy! Billy! Glo. let's go. I got one last little detail to take care of. get outta here! Al? Richard. Foul play. Just what I needed. this belongs to you. it belongs to the government and I'm gonna be a little too frail to enjoy it by then. This way I get the jewels and the insurance now. Richard You're going to regret this. you're gonna regret this more than I do. Not really. I ju– I've called the police. And they're gonna jump out of their hiding places and yell "Freeze"? Hopefully. Freeze! Johnny: Gina! we gotta get outta here. Come on. I think this is a good time to stop and–and reconsider the purchase of just a few more of these picnic tickets. they're only two-fifty apiece. and I think Hawaii would be a great–would be a great release. And I got all Don Ho's hits – I bought all of his greatest hits. And I love those–the–the drinks with the blue and yellow– I–I– get with it! I just don't understand it. Company picnic. Good times. I called everybody I know. everybody I ever heard of. And Miss Nance– Hayes. Even I bought tickets from her. you bought tickets from me. only two. uh... Where are the girls? they're late aren't they?

When you're rich. Thirty! Coming! The pigs! This is for real. Both want a fuck? Then that's sixty francs. I want a beer before starting. It's over, grandpa. We've got to go. You get one go, not all night. Like her? A blonde, next time. Instead of shouting, you should bring us a beer! My back aches. You must have really got off with those monkeys! It makes me want to puke. The sex-starved jerks didn't make you come? The fun's all over, for me. - What's up? - Nothing. Tell me. Something's wrong, tell me what it is. Leave me alone. What's going on? Talk to me. Leave me alone. Here, take this. You think that can make me happy? Take it, I said. It's for your kid. She's putting on an act. You've been had, again. Turn off the TV. - Finished your homework? - A kiss... Everyone go and wash. Hey, you donkey! Aren't you ashamed of sleeping while your mother works? You'll get up early to see a girl, and a French one at that! I saw you! Aren't you ashamed? Mom, I need money for a notebook. Let me cry my heart out. This boy will be the death of me. - How much? - Fifteen francs. Go and get your father! Hello, Madj. Hi, lsa. - How's your mother? - Still shouting. She's right. You tire her out. You know you're not allowed alcohol. There's orange juice, if you like. Hey Pat... since your sister started work she won't talk to us. Don't mention work we'll start a fight. So, Miss Secretary... any work for a cleaner? A pretty girl shouldn't be stuck in an office. Cut it out. Coming, Madjid? Let's split. Are you coming? Here are my saviours. Get them a drink. What did you save her from? Shut up! It's not funny. It was for her kid. Anything new? A few, take a look. Good thing they put up the fence. Do up your pants, your tools are showing. Put it away before we cut it off! What's wrong? Mallard's wine. I stole it from his cellar. Let's see if that's true. Motherfucker! A toast to us! Hand over the bottles! Come on. Holy shit! We'll get smashed! What a party. You guys, we're having a party. Come on, there's wine and everything. It's Christmas! - Make room! - Go ahead. Shit, that's huge! Here's to old Mallard! Let's get out of here! Nice of you to drop by! Come on, dad? Son of a bitch! I'll show you... Come on, come on... I thought they weren't afraid of anything! He's out cold. Anita! Did you see Mallard's face? See Pelletier? Look at the motherfucker running! Well done. Hey, Pat... You brought your gang? Shut up, fat ass. We came here to learn. Looks like you guys have been done. This is a cinema, not a hospital. Fat Luc, you with your lady? Mind your business. Last time she came through here she came back on all fours! Ask her if she still has those blue panties. There's a fight in the air. Blood! Blood... lsn't your name Mallard? You live over in building B? Opposite from Pelletier? I know them. They booze up at the station bar on Fridays. Winos out! Winos out! That's really smart! - A quiet cuddle? - l'm dead! - Got a cigarette? - Yes. The last one. I'm going to see my mother. She'll have some cash. Mine shouts all the time. Mine too. Especially now my sister's working. Makes me look like a bum. Any news of your father? Neither him nor the neighbour. Then she must still fuck well. No reason to drop everything. We fucked her too but we didn't run off with her. I told my mom I went to the labour office to fill in forms. - Really think she believed you? - Yes! You can't even write. Got a little something? Where should we drop you? We have to go, we work tomorrow. We work, too! We can't leave like this... Start with our own then switch? - Mine's good, hey? - Not bad. You can start with her, as long as we're switching... Come on, between brothers... Alright, if you want. Your mother? - Where is she? - She's dead. - You're all alone? - My dad lives in the States. - He's American? - Polish. So you're Jewish. Shame you have your period. - How did yours fuck? - Cool it! Can't even joke, now. Chantal, get in. Rotten weather. You OK? What's wrong? You should stay in bed instead of following me every day. I wanted to see you. Yeah, right! What's with the car? It's a Citroen. Did you steal it? I didn't want you getting wet. - l won't stay in a stolen car. - l didn't steal it. You're full of shit! If I knew how, I'd tell you... - First, you have to change. - lt's you who's changed. - How was I before? - You didn't avoid me. is there a guy? A guy... Poor idiot. We haven't any mauve. The U's in yellow. No, you've done the O's, now do the U's. But there's no yellow. Hi, is he ready? - When will you be back? - Two days. And not three, OK? - Dad! - Hello, sweetie. I guess 3 days would be too much, like paying child support. I'm in the shit, I'll give it to you later. - Come see what I've done. - l'm coming. Show me your works of art. Show me how much progress you've made. The teacher wrote that? - No, I did. - l hope so! And what's this? Can you read this? I've lost my job, you know. Come on, let's go now. - Are you coming? - No, I'm busy. - Let's go to the sea. - Yes! You OK, Steph? In good shape? Happy? What's wrong? What's going on? Oh, sweetheart... Come on! Mom! Give him a spoonful if he coughs, and see he has a pillow. What's wrong? Shit! What are you doing? Leave that alone! Hey, you guys! Hi, Balou. It's Balou! Unbelievable, he's back! I thought he was still inside. Check out the car! Look at the bills! We could make them fall off. Look! Holy shit, he's rolling in money. Look at that bird! Mamma mia, check out the chick! I can't see anything. What a honey! She's shaved her pussy, brother! I can see everything. Whatever. That's much more interesting. You don't get it, it's an old bet. To the winner! Once more... Thanks, Balou! Let's drink to this! Where have you come back from? He couldn't read, either. The-tea-harem-of-Archimedes. The theorem of Archimedes. You've been drinking? Drunkard! Now he's taken to drinking. That's all I needed. Aren't you ashamed? Drunkard. Good-for-nothing! Bum! What will the neighbours think? He's killing me. Madjid, my son... I'm worn out. I'm going to ask the Consulate to take you home. You'll do your military service. You'll learn your own language and you'll become a man. It's the only way. I'm tired of trying to make you see, you don't understand. Help me, my son... What's left for your mother? You're ruining yourself and me as well. Think of your brothers and sisters. I'm worn out, tired. May Allah protect and forgive us! Stéphane, and mama and Josette. Four, three, two, one... Happy New Year! My God! What's happening to us now? Madjid, hurry up! Go up to Josette's apartment. Quickly! Don't do it, Josette! Oh, Allah! What about the little one? My God, Josette, don't do it! Tomorrow I'll find you a job. A good job... Well paid. I'll hire you, tomorrow. At the canteen. You'll be a waitress, it's well paid... She's a kid, she owes me 3 months rent. The fire brigade is on its way. Tomorrow, Josette! I'll find you work! Tomorrow... Allah... Your little boy, who will he call mother? Think of the boy... We're with you. No, Josette! Don't! Your little boy will be looking for his mommy! Mom, look at my Babar! Allah! At Auteuil, the filly Nougatine could well beat Mégalite, also doing well, and still the favourite... News flash from Jean Gallé: The body ofa North African was found on the banks of the Seine. The initial identification has been made as a Mr Lakhdar... Lakhdar, Lakhdar, my son... They've killed my son. Yesterday they got Abdelir at Nanterre, and Kader at Vitry. They got Touffik at La Courneuve... Tomorrow who will it be? - Tomorrow, it'll be you! - Tomorrow, it'll be you... - lt's no good. - What's no good? It's too fast. Yes, it's too fast. We'll take it again... What's it about? His mother made another scene yesterday. Any jobs going? Come by and ask. Tomorrow? But no fucking around, or I'll get it. Don't worry. Hey, Frenchie, you want to act with us? We need a white guy to play a cop. What does it pay? You'll never change. Which side is the street? Stop wasting time. - l don't know how to do it. - l'll show you one last time. I don't care. Get out. This is your nice easy job? - They threw you out too? - lf you like. Don't say you left so as not to let me down. I didn't say that. You're an idiot. I'm an idiot? You can't even weld 3 wires! - lt just doesn't interest me. - What would interest my lord? - Shut up! - Ok, it's over. - You could have got one with nuts. - Then change it. As you move forward, bend... You're moving like my grandmother. Come on. The rich. Did you see her ass? They can't even play, it's all to show off. - Let's do the locker rooms. - They do sports, they run fast! Yeah, right. Don't worry, come on. Holy shit, we cleaned up! Shit, brother, they're something! Check out the black one. Wow, holy shit! That one would need a whip. My dick needs action. Go dip your wick. - Too many people around. - Who gives a shit? Are you going, or not? I don't know which one. Look, check out the one sitting on the red car. She doesn't look bad. Yeah, I'm off. Meet you in the bar. - Excuse me... - Don't go. You won't tell, will you? Not anybody? Don't worry, I won't. Promise. Don't, your brother's over there. Don't cry, I won't tell him. Here... - No, I don't want anything. - Come on. No, I fuck everything up. Madj... We'll have to start calling you Lucky Luke. Pulls a gun faster than his shadow. So? I didn't go. Why not? She was a drag queen? A whisky, please. Something's wrong. Madjid... what are you doing? Come on. Come on! Pat as well! Get in! We have to get his dad. Cut the bullshit! He can't sleep there and he can't get home alone. - We'll take him. - Yeah, get in. Alright. Oh, the sweet rat. Hey, he's coming back. Get a move on, Mado! Shit, we're in a hurry. Come on. - Roll up. - lt's Christmas! Where'd you get this? - Where'd the car come from? - His dad, we're breaking it in. I've got an idea. Keep it, your last one put us in police custody. - Tell us. - Let's go to the sea. - Yeah, why not? - l don't have my bikini. That's OK, you can still have a swim. What do you think? Let's go! Shut up. Guess you'd rather go home to your dad. Tomorrow we'll pick up rich babes in Deauville. Old ones, with lots of cash. Fifty-fifty! - You can't. - Because? Rich women like to fuck blacks, not go out with them. Madjid and I are going to have a festival at Cannes. You sit in a chic café, where they like drinking their tea. You choose one that's not too moth-eaten, she looks at you... You give her a baby smile and she gets all wet to do a kid. And her husband? Doesn't care, he's gay. The bourgeois are all fags. But I'll never be rich if they're all fags! Their wives are bored shitless. Anyway, you stay on that café patio. You look at her again. She looks at you. She cracks, goes to the john... And calls you in. Let me finish, idiot. She goes off with her little purse, writes her phone number on a piece of paper, then goes back to sit down. She says to her husband: "Shall we go home, darling?" She lets him go first, and as she passes your table, as cool as can be, she puts it in front of you, my brother. - But you can't read! - Loser. A phone number just needs to be dialled. She waits for you in her villa behind the hill, with its big iron gate and huge trees all around. You press the bell at the gate, and hear the intercom say: "l'll open up, my love". The gate opens by itself... And what do you do with the dogs? The rich always have huge, flashy mutts. She's sent everyone away, it's all yours. You cross the garden, already with a hard-on. You reach the door. She opens it, the slut, wearing a long, white see-through dress. You check out her boobs as she passes. She takes your hand... and leads you to a chair. She takes your jacket, you sit down, she says: "Whisky or champagne, my love?" She fills the glasses. Cheers. She looks at you with sultry eyes. She offers a cigar box. You take one and she lights it for you. You take a deep puff... and let yourself fall back into the armchair. Then you close your eyes... and feel her fingers opening your flies. And my knob's off and running. Give her a ball, like a real pleb, until she's worn out. That way she'll call you again. And if she wears you out you call us in? She puts a wad of bills in your pocket, and you start seeing her often. She introduces you to her sister, her mother, her sister-in-law... No hassle, you give it to them all while the husband gets buggered on his yacht. Your bullshit has sent Madjid to sleep. Let him sleep. He makes the plans and I carry them out. Wait for me! See? This is fun. Unbelievable! Hey, it's the cops! Cops! Shit, guys! Madjid! - Where are you lot from? - With him, we'll get the others. Sous-titrage : Eclair Vidéo Ripped by southside in 2002 I deliver perfection... and don't brag about it! : D I thought you'd never get back. There was a heck of a crowd on the piste. So I see. - Mission accomplished? - Best beluga. Vodka - rather shaken - and one microchip. Good. I'll make a signal to M. Be a good girl, would you, and put her on automatic. And we could do with a couple of glasses. They're in the overhead rack. Commander Bond...! Call me James. It's five days to Alaska. - Thank goodness you're here, James. - That's very nice, Moneypenny. A little over the top for the office? I've been trying to reach you all morning. What have you been up to? Rest and recreation, my darling. The trip back from Siberia took a lot out of me. Your dedication when you're on the job is most commendable, James. Omit the customary pleasantries, Miss Moneypenny. We're pressed for time. I'll fill you in later, Moneypenny. - Minister. - Commander. Good morning, sir. A new pet, Q? If, 007, you'd ever bothered to read any memos sent from my department, you would realise this is a prototype of a sophisticated surveillance machine. Now we're all here you can get on with the briefing, Q. Very good, sir. Gentlemen... A silicon integrated circuit: The essential part of all modern computers. No lecture, Q. We're all aware of the microchip. Until recently, all microchips were susceptible to damage from the intense magnetic pulse of a nuclear explosion. - Magnetic pulse? - Yes, Minister. One burst in outer space over the UK and everything with a microchip in it, from the modern toaster to sophisticated computers and our defence systems, would be rendered useless. We'd be paralysed - at the Russians' mercy. That is why a private defence contractor came up with this: A chip totally impervious to magnetic pulse damage. Now - if I place it on the micro-comparator and compare it with the chip Bond recovered from the body of 003 in Siberia... - When I bring the two images together... - They're identical. The KGB must have a pipeline into that research company. It would appear so. Six months ago that company was acquired by an Anglo-French combine: Zorin Industries. There has been a security check of the plant? A very extensive one. But we have no leads. What about Zorin himself? Max Zorin? Impossible. He's a leading French industrialist. A staunch anti-communist with influential friends in the government. With due respect, Minister, the leak did occur after Zorin bought the company. Precisely why I've initiated an investigation. All right, but let's be discreet about it. But of course, Minister. You have exactly 35 minutes to get properly dressed, 007. They round the turn. Just under a mile to race from this point. Come on, Fluke! Move your ar... - Who is number one? The grey with him? - Oh, that's Pegasus. Zorin's horse. With the cane. Max Zorin? Yes. Born in Dresden. Fled from East Germany in the sixties. French passport. Speaks at least five languages, no accent. Now the talk of the City and the Bourse. - The old rags-to-riches story. - Made his first fortune in oil and gas. Now a second in electronics and hi-tech. Who's that with him under the hat? With the red dress. A girlfriend? We're not sure about her. American. She's never far from him. Name's May Day. And dressed for the occasion. Come on, Fluke! Get a wiggle on! Pegasus has come from nowhere, and as they go for the line it's Pegasus who storms clear off Fluke and Cooper Girl. First, number one; second, number two; and third, number five. First number one, Pegasus; second number two, Fluke; and third number five, Cooper Girl. Unbelievable! In all my years as a trainer I've never seen a horse run such a fast last furlong. Sir Godfrey Tibbett. Our department. - Many congratulations. - Thank you. - Lucky man, Zorin. - Could be more than luck, Admiral. - Fixed? - Your guess is as good as mine. The French Jockey Club have hired a detective, Aubergine, to look into it. Easy, Pegasus. Calm down, Pegasus. Steady. She must take a lot of vitamins. Perhaps Pegasus does too. I think I should meet with this detective friend of yours. Yes. Might have some interesting information for us. Set it up, Tibbett. Right you are. Moneypenny - be a darling, would you, and collect that for me. - I'll buy you dinner when we get back. - Pegasus! Bollinger, '75. I see you are a connoisseur, Monsieur Bond. - Ensuite, Lafite Rothschild '59. - Another excellent choice. I'm pleased you approve - since you're paying the bill. - Cheers. - Santé, Monsieur Aubergine. The Sùreté has no information on Zorin before he came over from East Germany? Through a personal connection I saw his dossier myself. But even Sùreté records are sometimes incomplete! "Et voici maintenant" the fabulous Dominique and the enchanted "papillons"! Perhaps we should add this butterfly to our collection, no? Tell me, why do Zorin's horses beat others with superior bloodlines? This is a mystery. - Could he be using drugs? - Nothing showed up in the tests. Later this month, Zorin will hold his annual sales at his stud near Paris. Security is formidable but the key to this mystery is there. And I, Achille Aubergine, intend to find it. - Qu'est-ce qu'il y a? - There's a fly in his soup. - Follow that parachute. - Crazy English! Out. My car! My car! Congratulations. So? This operation was to be conducted discreetly. It took six million francs in damages and penalties for violating most of the Napoleonic Code. Under the circumstances it was more important to identify the assassin. What did you learn from Aubergine before his demise? Only that Zorin is having a thoroughbred sale at his stud not far from here. I should be there. - Can you help me, Sir Godfrey? - I may be able to arrange an invitation. It's a bit short notice... but I might just be able to squeeze you in. Thank you. Sir Godfrey, your hat. Mr Saint John Smith? St John Smythe, my dear. - My name is Scarpine. Head of security. - How do you do. - We have a room for you at the chateau. - Oh, splendid. By the way, the preview is in progress at the main stables. - Is that it? - No, no, those are the servants' quarters. The stables are over here. Let me escort you there. - Catalogue of the sales. - Thank you. Tell me - the lthacus colt. Is it here? - You mean the full brother of Pegasus? - Yes. He's the outstanding horse of the sales. He'll be shown last. We expect him to fetch over three million dollars. Sounds quite reasonable. If you need any further assistance please call me. Thank you. Steady! Steady, Pegasus. Keep him on a tight rein! Steady now, Pegasus. We are now very proud to present the full brother of Pegasus. This colt is born in the purple. Monsieur Smythe. Monsieur Zorin has been detained. He's anxious to meet you at the reception in the chateau gardens later. I look forward to it. - I wish you wouldn't keep wandering off. - I'm sorry, sir. Your driver may stay in the servants' quarters. I'm sure that'll be more than adequate. What do you say, Tibbett? - Welcome, sir. I'm Jenny Flex. - Of course you are. - I'll call a porter. - Oh, no need. My man'll take care of it. - Let me show you to your room. - Thank you. When you're ready, Tibbett. Well, my dear, I take it you spend a lot of time in the saddle. - Yes, I love an early morning ride. - I'm an early riser myself. Come along, Tibbett. Stop wheezing. Don't stand there panting, Tibbett. Start unpacking. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. - The reception is at six. - Thank you, my dear. Well, you heard what Miss Jenny Flex said: There is a reception at six. - Yes, sir. - So I need a white jacket and a black tie. Yes, sir. - And if possible, a clean shirt. - Yes, sir. Oh, my Lord, Tibbett! Look at the state of my clothes. - How on earth do you pack my bags? - Sorry, sir. Mr Faras told his trainer he'll go to a million for the lthacus colt. - Good. Anything from St John Smythe? - Nothing about the sale, sir. - But I'd hate to be his valet. - You'll have to buck up your ideas. - I'm sorry, sir. - Don't be so damned obsequious. Oh, my Lord. What the devil's wrong with these shoes? - Were they wiped over with an oily rag? - Terribly sorry, sir. You blasted well should be. I don't know how long you expect to remain in my employ... - Well done, my good man. - Must we keep this up when we're alone? A successful cover becomes almost second nature. What's all this about Pegasus disappearing? One minute he's in his stall - the next, neither hide nor hair of him. We should look into it. Well, don't you concern yourself with that. There's the man I saw at the Pegasus stable - Another wealthy owner? - Who knows? - But she'd bear closer inspection. - We're on a mission. Sir Godfrey, on a mission I am expected to sacrifice myself. Lovely party. Enjoying our little party, Monsieur... Saint John Smythe? Immensely. St John Smythe. Looks as though you'll have a good turnout for the sale tomorrow. May I introduce Miss Sutton? Sheikh Farouk. - Welcome. - Mr Zorin. Main Strike all set? We'll know after the 22nd. - Thank you. - Enjoy yourself. You were looking for something? Yes, I... was looking for the bar. Come. I will show you. Oh, by the way, the name is St John Smythe. James St John Smythe. Dr Carl Mortner. At your service. - Hiya, doc! - Good afternoon, Mr Conley. Mr Conley, Mr Smythe. Bob Conley. - Are you a trainer? - Horses? Hell, I can't even ride. - I'm in the oil business. - Oh. Texas? Frisco. I handle Mr Zorin's oil interests there. Would you excuse us? Come on, honey. Are you a doctor of medicine? Oh, no, no. I am Mr Zorin's breeding consultant. Oh, really? Then you can let me into a little secret. How is it you succeed with breeding bloodlines other experts think inferior? Selective breeding is important. But more important is conditioning and a desire, "ja"? Are you talking about people or horses? My principles apply equally to human beings. Mr St John Smythe. Allow me to introduce myself. Mr Zorin, it's a great pleasure. - A groom asked if you'd go to the stables. - Of course. You will excuse me? I must congratulate you, Mr Zorin. Your stables are magnificent. Built in the 16th century by a duke who believed he'd be reincarnated as a horse. Have thoroughbreds interested you long? Oh, no. As a matter of fact I had a dotty old aunt die and leave me some stables. So I thought it might be rather fun to breed and raise horses. - I take it you ride? - I'm happiest in the saddle. A fellow-sportsman. What about fishing? Fly casting? I'm neglecting my other guests. You'll find the young ladies stimulating company. I'm sure they are. Hello. I thought you might like to join the party. By the way, the name is James St John Smythe. I'm English. - I never would have guessed. - Really? Well, are you buying or selling? - Selling? ! - Horses. No, I'm not interested in horses. Well, you came to the wrong place, didn't you? May Day. Get her away from him. I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before. Have Security keep a good eye on him. You didn't say what part of the States you come from, Miss... No. I didn't. I suppose you travel a lot? Your helicopter leaves in 20 minutes. You're not staying the night? I was hoping we'd spend the evening together. Now I shall be all alone. I doubt that. - Well, let me walk you to the chopper. - That won't be necessary. - Someone will take care of you. - You'll see to that personally, will you? Are you looking for this? Quite a letdown. - St John Smythe? - Sleeping like a baby. That's a boy. There we are. It's interesting. He's had surgery. Surgery? That is how Zorin won the race. Mortner implanted one of these microchips into Pegasus. You see, these microchips are programmed to control an injection of additional natural horse steroids. - To overcome fatigue during the race. - How? The injection itself, with that small needle, is triggered by a remote-control transmitter small enough to fit into the tip of a jockey's whip - or a cane. The lights! There's a world surplus of microchips and Zorin is hoarding them! - I'm afraid I wasn't much help. - Don't worry. It's all wrapped up. Keep your guard up higher. And retain your balance. - What now? - We'd better get back. The tape ran out five minutes ago. I told you not to disturb us. It's important. There's been intruders in the warehouse. Put Security on full alert. Let's see where Mr St John Smythe is. "He" was the man at the Eiffel Tower. - We must find him. - I'll get dressed. May Day, where have you been? I've been waiting for you. To take care of me personally. I see you're a woman of very few words. What's there to say? - Is everything here? - Ja, ja. Except this. It is in the wrong place. Bring St John Smythe to my study first thing in the morning. Good morning. I understand you wish to see me. - You slept well? - A little restless, but I got off eventually. I have the Progeny Index on the computer: A compilation of thoroughbred bloodlines. Might be helpful to you in selecting your purchase this afternoon. As I see it, you need a stallion. For breeding. A stallion sounds right to me. I find a computer indispensable. I have a stallion. Descended from that horse there. Misty. We have several horses that might interest you. Splendid. Would you be interested primarily in stamina? - Or speed? - Well, a little of both would be ideal. I think I have just the horse for you. It's time for my morning ride. - Why don't you try him out? - That sounds a very good idea. - I shall get into some riding clothes. - Good. Half an hour, then. Scarpine will collect you. Thank you. Tibbett, get into town, call M and ask him to put a trace on this cheque. Be quick. If those guards we laid out identify us we'll have to move fast. What shall I say if they ask where I'm going? Just tell them you have to get the car washed. Just going to town to get the car washed. - Your mount, Mr St John Smythe. - A beautiful beast. A little spirited. What's his name? Inferno. - Friends of yours? - Exercise boys. Jumping together is more realistic training. Frankly, I prefer cross-country to steeplechase. As one sportsman to another, I'll make you a proposition. You can have that lthacus colt gratis if you stay this course. - And if I'm thrown? - Then you lose. You leave me little choice. Splendid. Scarpine will start us. Steady! Keep going! Sir Godfrey. Let's get... You lost, 007. - Killing Tibbett was a mistake. - I'm about to make the same one twice. My department know I'm here. They'll retaliate. If you're the best they have, they'll more likely try to cover up your incompetence. Don't count on it, Zorin. - You amuse me, Mr Bond. - Well, it's not mutual. Other side. Open up. - Good morning, Comrade Zorin. - General Gogol. - This meeting is ill-advised. - A calculated risk. But necessary, as you refuse to answer your control. Come to the point, General. You disregard procedure. You did not request approval before eliminating 007. - Reprisals might jeopardise operations. - You jeopardise mine! Letting the British penetrate the Siberian research centre. That was regrettable. Your racing activities attract unnecessary attention, but more disturbing are your unauthorised commercial ventures. We cannot tolerate that. The issue is irrelevant. I've made new associations. I no longer consider myself a KGB agent. We trained you. Financed you. What would you be without us? A biological experiment. A freak. Enough of this! Control yourselves. You will come back to us, Comrade. No one ever leaves the KGB. Gentlemen. For centuries alchemists tried to make gold from base metals. Today we make microchips from silicon, which is common sand. But far better than gold. For several years we've had a profitable partnership: You as manufacturers, while I passed on to you industrial information that made you competitive, successful. We are now in the unique position to form an international cartel to control not only production but distribution of these microchips. There is one obstacle. Silicon Valley. Near San Francisco. Over 250 plants employing thousands of scientists, technicians. This is the heartland of electronic production in the United States, which accounts for what - 80% of the world microchip market. I propose to end the domination of Silicon Valley. - And to leave us in control of that market. to choose one. Who would that be? Hee, of course. I'd save your ass cause I can bust her later. You don't get many chances. You don't get many friends you'd die for, either. It's not too late, man. You can change your mind. Cheers. I'm all wet! Wait till that stain gets washed off. I've had it. Give me money for laundry. Ask her. I'll pay for it when I do that again. Aim well next time. I'll try. Where are all the taxis? Let's take a subway. In this rain? You're wet anyway. I don't have a girl to take care of me if I catch a cold. Come on, let's run! You sure? It's gonna rain all night long. I like it. I don't think they do. It's bedtime for them. Looks like the rain woke them up. What are they saying? They want us to keep quiet. How are your Kissingurami? They fight a lot. One minute, they hate each other next minute they're hugging, kissing and stuff. They're always like that. When I go out, I get worried about them. If I am not there, you have to take care of them. I don't think I can. I can't even handle 'Kissing' and 'Anabus' at home That's why you have to learn more. To live with them, you have no choice. Your sweater is almost done. I hope it looks good on you. What should I get you for the wedding? All I want is whatever happens to me, you love and never leave me. That's all. Because you're the only one who truly understands me. shiri Step 1 On! On the 17th, 1 million dollars were transferred from Lim's account into Kim's. Kim? He looks most suspicious on the transaction record. Who's he? Nat'l Defense lab researcher. Kim speaking. Yes. Okay. As a part of new weapons system being developed we launched the CTX project last year. If Kim was doing business with the weapon's dealer chances are very high that it was CTX. Tell me more about the CTX. CTX is a new type of energy originally invented by Korea Energy Development Lab we've been working on turning it into a weapon. At first, we had problems with its delicate detonation conditions but the test we did last month was successful. People at your agency know about this, too. It'll bring a sensational change to the military weapon system. How's it different from the conventional bombs? It's a liquid bomb. What's most amazing about CTX is that it's indistinguishable from water. When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color and you can't detect the liquid itself with any devices. Yet the effect is ten times more powerful than any other bombs you've ever seen. What if a black-market dealer got it? He could get the information on it but not the CTX itself. Because you need 3 or 4 approvals to release it. If Mr. Kim took a bribe to hand it over he would've returned the money. Where's it made and kept? That's confidential, sorry. But CTX's never been released until today. How are you so sure? When CTX is released it goes through 3 authorization checkpoints and this morning everything was in order. You're saying it was released this morning? For the weapon show tomorrow, it's being transferred to headquarters as we speak. Sera Mike 1, stop at Dongsan service area. Will Hee turn up? She wants the CTX. She wouldn't miss this chance. Why are they bothering us? They want two secret agents to ride with us. What for? What the hell is that? Sir, We need to check the vehicles. I wasn't informed of this. What's going on? We got a report of a possible interception of CTX. Your permit and ID, please. CTX's safe with us. Get out of the way. Didn't you hear me? I asked for your permit and ID, didn't I? This is Sera Mike 1, we're stopped at a checkpoint. I don't have time for this. I'll fax it to you. If you resist, we'll have to arrest you. What did you say? We'll have to arrest you... or kill you. Are you nuts? I'm fine. Are you out of your mind? You fucking moron! Are you fucking nuts? Wait, look at this. What base are you from? Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea! Sera Mike 1, Do you copy? They've been hit! It's worse than we thought! It's a bomb, run! Hee asked Lim for the CTX and Lim bribed the researcher to hand it over. But when they realized it couldn't be done they planned to intercept it on the road. In the process, Lim and Kim were murdered, along with 20 of our armed guards. How much CTX was taken? About a gallon. It is enough to blow up an entire city. Any leads on the interceptors? Not yet, sir. Just an assumption that they're involved with Hee. But why would North Korea do that in a time of reconciliation? We haven't seen the hidden camera mounted on the vehicle but the gunfire at the scene makes me think that they're highly-trained North Korean militants. Their military system is falling fast. We can't rule out the possibility that they were a private organization wanting the CTX for their own purpose. The question is what are they planning to do with the CTX. If it blows up in Seoul, we're finished. Why not make an official statement to the North-Korean government? Not until we have solid proof. We also need to figure out why their target was the CTX. As you all know, it may explode without the detonator. And no devices can detect the liquid itself. If they utilize those traits, expect the worst. There's no way to predict when, where, or how it's gonna go off. Dinner? I don't feel like it. Is the meeting over? Little while ago. Anything special? Ready to order? Hi! Hi! Beer, please. OK. What about the scene? An inspection of the scene was delayed and the bodies were just taken to headquarters. The film will be handed over tomorrow. Any leads? Just bodies and shells. Isn't it strange? Anything else? This is the third time. Lim, Kim.. This time CTX was intercepted. We went to see Lim right after the call... .. and to the lab right after we got the report. We're always a step behind. It's like they were reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Don't jump to the conclusion. Today we went to the lab without notice. Kim didn't even know that we were coming and he got killed 5 minutes before we got there. If that's the case... it's obvious. Only director Ko and I knew about those killings and CTX. And you made the report. shiri 1's entered. It's been a long time. At 09:00. With sunglasses on. You've changed a lot. It's been six years. How's my family? They're fine. I miss them. Completion is near. You'll meet them soon. A barrier is in the way. Get rid of it. Target? Kissingurami. Finish the job before the completion. Acknowledged. For the unification. For the unification. We're always a step behind. They were reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Hello? It's me, Ho. Can I see you tomorrow? Sure, what's going on? I have a favor to ask. Call me at the Police Agency tomorrow. OK. See you tomorrow. I'll call you. What are you doing there? You scared me! You just got here? No, earlier. I cleaned and did the laundry. Nothing was in the refrigerator. We ran out of coffee so I went grocery shopping. What's wrong? You don't look so good. Just busy at work. Why didn't you call? I was gonna leave soon. Dinner? Not yet. I had a late lunch. Let me fix dinner for us. What are we having? Your favorite. You wanna take a shower? After dinner. I think it's done. Let it simmer. Can you hand me the cloth pins and hangers from the sofa? I couldn't find the pins. It's OK. Leave it, I'll do it. When are you moving in? Soon, I guess. I haven't packed up yet. Let me help you pack up. OK. With you here, it won't be as lonely. You hated eating alone and waking up by yourself. You'll whisper in my ear to wake me up from now on. I'll make the coffee, and you'll play soft music. Should we buy birds? You'd like birds singing in the morning. Promise me that you keep the promise you made to me a year ago. Trust me. I'll never drink again because I have you. A soccer team of South and North Korea returned today to the Seoul Training Center after training in Pohang with North Korean officials coming through 'Panmunjum'. The North Korean President Lee and officials will deliver a message on a permanent peace.... When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color you can't tell the difference from water with the naked eye. But it's a different story with the light on. Turn it on. It's on. CTX responds to daylight over 6000 kelvin. The light alone may start its reaction but without heat, it's no good. Fire. What? Yes, sir. It's on, sir. If you expose it to both light and heat nitro-alpha inside the sphere and beta outside react differently. But when the liquid in the sphere becomes red, the sphere pops. Nitro-alpha and beta combined causes the explosion. How much power does it have? This is about 200cc, so everything within the radius of 1 kilometer would disappear. Since the detonation varies depending on the reaction the sensor here tells you when it's exploding. Like now, if the sphere becomes red it means the explosion is imminent. If you don't stop it before the sphere pops, it explodes. But with either light or heat removed, the reaction stops. I've never seen an agent like you in 20 years. You're an oddball. I am not, sir. Admit it! No, I am not. Admit it! Then I wouldn't be cleaning the fish bowls. Agent Ryu, come to room 17. I gotta go. Find CTX as soon as possible so we can go drinking. We'll find it! Anyone recognizes him? Don't you remember, Ryu? His name is Park. A top agent for the North Korean 8th special forces. When Ryu stormed the plane that'd been hijacked he was the only one that escaped from the plane a painful memory for Ryu. Clear! Hee and Park... All the pieces are coming together. Agent Lee? Find out what's going on with 8th special forces. And you get the daily data of spy satellites from Nat'l Defense. Agent Yoon! Yes, sir. Post Park's montage throughout the country. They're 8th special forces. It's worse than we expected. The 8th special forces intercepted CTX, why? Three possibilities here. First, to sell it off to a third country. Second, to use it on the negotiation table for money or to seek asylum to another country. Third, a strategy they are known for they say they want peace and stab us in the back. It must be either for the money or an explosion. If they wanted the money, why CTX? Robbing the Bank of Korea'd be much easier. Why'd they spoil the peace conference by using the bomb? That's difficult to answer. Hee is key to all this. We don't have time. We'll find a way. What do you see? Can't even tell me? Maybe the solution is much closer than we think. What do you mean? Hee could be close by. Hey, you! What the hell are you doing here? I am looking for the man's room. Are you fucking blind? Didn't see the sign "RESTRICTED AREA"? Hey, you hear me? I sure did. Watch your mouth. Take care. How have you been? Bored to death. I feel more insecure when it's so quiet. I need some backup. What about your agency? The air isn't very clear there. What do you mean? I think there's a leak. This is the only way. It must be very stressful. It'll get better. When do you need it? Tomorrow. I'm coming, too. Sorry, no married man. Time and place? I'll call you. All right, then. Ho! We'll talk later. How's your friend? He'll live. I am glad to hear that. Have a seat. Who else knew you two were meeting? It was very personal. I didn't tell anybody. Lim, Kim, Ho.... Hee is very nearby. There must be a leak. Nobody knows that for sure. Internal affairs are on it. You don't trust your men? Do you trust me? Traps could be anywhere. Maybe there's a hole in the security system but that possibility is almost zero. Don't share the information with anybody. Not even with your partner, Lee. Traps under your feet are hard to see. I'm the Director in charge. I'm Park, of the 8th special forces. I want to talk to my old friend. Thanks for calling me friend. I was gonna send you a coffin, but you were lucky. Disappointed with Hee's shooting. Save it. We can take you out anytime. Maybe I'll take you out first. So, you've become a man. You know where I am? Young drunk kids here yelling on the street.... While people in the north are starving to death. People here have wastes building up in their bellies. What an unfair world. Listen, friend. We have 10 CTXs placed all over Seoul. I'll call you 30 minutes before each of them goes off. You'd better find them before people get hurt. What do you want? Slow down, friend. The first one is on the roof of the Golden Tower. You have exactly 30 minutes. You know the fish named shiri? It's a Korean aboriginal fish, living in crystal streams. Though they're separated with the country divided some day they'll reunite in the same streams. Should I buy some for your girlfriend's fish shop? Why not. Stay alive until then. He's on the move. Clear! Found it! Hyun? Don't tell anybody you're here. Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care of the shop. What's going on? Don't ask. Please do as I say. I don't wanna stay here. Hyun! You haven't touched a drop for a year. This is me. You know that, don't you? What is it? What? You wanna know what? Tell me what's wrong. Dear People of the South Today marks an important and joyous moment in our history. I am here to put an end to years of confrontation and dissension and to open up a new era of understanding. You got a call. Hello? A guy who knows everything about the CTX contacted me. He's Hee's informant, and wants a deal. Where are you? I'm meeting him at the Hwain Cultural Center I'm on my way. Be there. On my way. He's wearing a black jacket and a black cap. Anything else? That's all. I'll be right there. You look good in a black jacket. Anyone else coming? Hee, maybe. So you called me expecting someone inside to leak the information? I hope it worked. Nobody at the agency knows that I'm here. You know it's impossible to tape the phones. So, if they show up I'm the rat? The MSG-90 Hee uses is a 5-shot semiautomatic. She used only two bullets, both for Lim and Ho. In both cases, you were in her range. If I were her I would have used the other three bullets. 3 targets went inside. Acknowledged. Stay in position. The mole must have been found. For the unification! Been a long time. Good to see you. Payback time for the flight 257. Look who's talking. You killed 7 of my men. You left your men behind. Cause I have a job to finish. You wanna know what it is? I'll ask Hee. It's my turn to send you a coffin. Won't be easy! Get back! 'She used only two bullets.' 'In both cases, you were in her range.' 'lf I were her...' '... I would have used the other three bullets.' Name: Hyun Residency: Cheju Island Innate Immunodeficiency Syndrome Admitted at Halla Hospital. Get me Halla Hospital in Cheju Island. Why'd you come here? They ambushed us. OP set a trap. Because you didn't follow orders to kill Ryu. If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. Thanks to you, we lost two of our men! I did what I could do. Yeah, you saved my life. What do you want? You've changed. Of course I have... from Hee to Hyun. Not only in appearance, but inside as well! I don't need a betrayer. We've waited 10 years for this moment. In those hours of pain, we pledged allegiance and buried our youth in the tomb of history. If you want to turn your back on us over personal feelings finish it here. I was stupid... thinking I could be Hyun. But I am just Hee who has to kill her man. I failed to change my inside. Let go! We have a job to finish. Avoid any physical contact with her, and no smoking because her immune system has dropped and make it quick. There she is. with the yellow sweater. Do you mind if I sit here? Sure. Are you from the public health center? I am looking for this girl. Anything happened to her? She's my old friend. I need to find her. She rented a room in our house 2 years ago and she'd visit me here quite often. She was very nice to me as if she were my real sister. She said she'd call me from Japan but I think she misplaced my number otherwise she'd have called. She went to Japan? She said it was for plastic surgery to remove a scar on her body. The day she left I cried my eyes out. She hugged me, and went on about how sorry she was. I didn't even know what she was sorry about... She didn't do anyting to me Prepare 10 million dollars and a 7 47 Jumbo at the airport by 2 o'clock. No mistakes. The Golden Tower was just the beginning. I hope I don't have to use the other 9 CTXs. Hello? Hello! Don't put cookies into the bowl. Two of them died today. I am not a fish shop boy. I'm an OP agent, too. You know how many fish bowls we've got here? I don't wanna deal with dead bodies any more. It's the cookies that killed it. No autopsy is needed.... If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. The soccer game between the South and North will finally be kicking off at Seoul Main Stadium at 2 P.M today. With the Presidents of two nations present... Hi, I'm here to collect for the newspaper. How much? 7 dollars. It's all right. Bye. What are you doing here? Going to a soccer game? I had 4 goldfishes on my desk with 4 goldfishes, and 2 of them died today. At first, I thought it was the cookies that killed them. But I was wrong 'SU300' inside their bodies is a high-tech bug that can be used underwater. I suspected my partner these last few days, including you. I planted some bugs here and got the information that I didn't want to get. From October 1996 to August 1997 When Hee disappeared, you were in Japan. You didn't need a fake passport coming back in because you became Hyun. Ryu went to Cheju Island to find the truth. What makes me sad is that my buddy, Ryu... loved you with all his heart. Let me ask you this. Did you really love him? Over here! I planted a bug in your car... Will you.... forgive me? Stay with me! The ambulance is on the way! I.... messed up. You're going to be Okay. You've always been the best! This won't.... kill me.... This won't.... Stay with me! The 7 47's here. Holding position, 100 meters northwest from the terminal 2. Snipers, make an entry through section D and take position. Their target is the soccer game. They're on their way to the stadium. What are you talking about? No time to explain. The stadium is at stake! They've set CTX around Seoul and want 10 million dollars. They were bluffing. Why the stadium? All the North Korean leaders are gathered there. Why would they do that? How the hell do I know? Call off the game immediately and evacuate all the spectators. Are you out of your mind? Call off the game? Imagine a CTX going off at the stadium! Go back to Headquarters. Don't worry about the stadium. Not even a drop of water can pass through security. It won't work. Listen to me! You lost your partner today. Go back, it's an order! I understand about liquor, but why not coffee? It's the rule, sorry. Your attention, please! No beverages will be allowed into the stadium. Thank you for your cooperation. The game will begin in 30 minutes. If I were in the airport, no doubt I could prove myself. But what the hell am I doing here, watching the gate? Both teams are now entering the stadium. What are you.... How have you been? Attention, please. Both Presidents Kim and Lee have just arrived! Let's give them a big hand! Get the lights ready. 3-G, Royal Box Section 3-G. Turn them on. / Turn the lights on? Who's in charge of the lights? What's wrong? Did you turn on the lights over the Royal Box? Why would anybody do that in a broad daylight? They're on now! Check it out. Main substation, speaking. Did you turn the lights on in section 3-G? Yes, there's a circuit problem. I'm working on it. Fix it quick. Today is not a regular day, you know. All right. He'll turn them off soon. Substation Leave right away. This is a restricted area. Who's in charge? Why? You want to turn off the lights? They'll never go out. Hey, friend! You finally made it here. Where's your backup? All at the airport? 011-244-1616... Hello, Dr. Min? It's me, Sik. Can't you hear me? It's me, the oddball! I have a question about the CTX. The CTX! What did you say were the conditions for self-detonation? This will be the graveyard for the corrupt politicians. Not only the politicians, but also innocent people. This is crazy! Sometimes history needs a craziness to help it. What do you want? A war! We're removing the barriers for a war. These people are not your barriers. When we're done here, our people's revolutionary army will start a war. It's not too late. Turn the lights off now! That's not what the people of this land want. They don't want another war to kill each other! Revolution always comes with pain. Sacrifices are necessary. There were people who thought the same as you in 1950. Remember the pain that the war caused in this country. I remember very well. What pain the war and separation left us. I'm putting an end to it. This game is to ease that pain! I know it can. We've waited for 50 years under those politicians but unfortunately, they don't want reunification. It's like we're watching a well-written play. Don't be mistaken. You're not the only one who wants reunification. We have to wait for the right moment. "Our hope is reunification. We dream about it..." When you sing this song our people in the North are dying on the street. They barely manage to live with roots and barks. Our sons and daughters are being sold off for fucking 100 dollars! Have you ever seen parents eating the flesh of their dead kids? With cheese, coke, and hamburgers... you wouldn't know. A soccer game to unite the nations? It's bullshit. We've had enough with the 50 years of deception. We're opening up a new history of Korea. 4 minutes to go. CTX will detonate soon. History will judge us. You know what? The pain you suffered for the last 50 years came from one person's misjudgment. Stop! Lights off in section 3-G? Turn them off! Right now! Don't waste your time. Nobody's turning them off. Turn them off! We're dying together here. Pull the trigger. Now! Good thing I have company on my way to hell Turn the lights off? You know where Hee is? She's in the audience, laughing at you. 'You know where Hee is? ' 'She's in the audience, laughing at you.' O2, this is O3.... Presidential guards, respond! Evacuate the President! Gate 52, he's on his way to the parking lot. Get out!

Oddballs revolt like you guys. Two. Oddballs don't like cleaning like you don't. I am not an oddball. Three. Oddballs chicken out! When'd you first meet her? March, last year. Give me the details. The next day I went to see her. I gave her a CD... and we had dinner together. We talked about music. Didn't you ever feel she was approaching you? Then I wouldn't be here. How were all the fish bowls brought in here? She wanted to put a few in my office for decoration. The agency bought the rest through me. She was pregnant. Did you know that? She never told me. How come? She could have used it to blindfold you. According to our report, you were getting married soon. You didn't suspect her at all dating for a whole year? What do you want me to say? Answer the question. We don't trust anybody. Even the fellow agents you share life with but she was an exception. It means you admit that you neglected your duty? It's not like you. Agent Ryu is dead. When was the first time you met Hee? It was Hyun, not Hee. Let's call her Hee. You know Hydra? She's a Goddess with 6 heads in Greek myths. She has multiple personalities with one body. Hyun and Hee... they're totally different. Hydra of our times the reality of separate Korea turned her into Hydra. This is Pager Voice Mail. You have one new message. Ryu it's me, Hyun. I am at the stadium. CTX's planted in the lights over the Royal Box. They'll turn the lights on from the substation. I'll be sitting in the west wing of the stadium. Do me a favor. I don't want to face you. Send someone else to get me. The times I had with you... ...is all of my life. With you I was neither Hyun nor Hee but just me. I won't ask you to understand me. Ryu... I miss you so much. I miss you.... How have you been? It's you again. Did you meet her? No. It would have been nicer if you came with her. What is this? They're Kissingurami. For me? They're beautiful. Thanks a lot. If one of them dies... the other dies, too. They dry up from loneliness, right? Don't be surprised. She knew everything about fish. In fact... She stayed over here quite a few times. You know how bad she is when she sleeps? I found her under the bed every morning. And when eating, you have to be alert. She's so bad with chopsticks that she throws food on you. Listen to this song. It was her favorite. Clear Found it! Hyun? Don't tell any body you're here. Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care of the shop. What's going on? Don't ask.

Cry in the water, then you'll know how. You're about the same size... as my boyfriend. Have you ever seen fishes laugh? No. It's already been a year. It was raining then, too. You came back the next day with a CD for me. - I said, "May I help you?" - "Anapus." Yeah, you said "Anapus" instead of"Anabus." "Bus!" It was a strange feeling. A total stranger gave me a CD I really liked. It was coincidental, but you felt so close, as if I'd known you for a long time. Did you go to alcohol cessation class today?

She knew about our rendezvous. Who? - Where? It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Please don't put ashes into the fishbowl. My goldfish smokes, too. Dr. Min, identified It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Hey, oddball! Lim was the head of black-market weapons dealers. We knew nothing about his organization. When'd he call you? Right before I called you. The perpetratorwas there at the same time. Considering the fact that he was at the scene... he wasn't being followed. Otherwise he would've been killed before the rendezvous. I'll tell you the details later, but it's about my client... who is onto something very dangerous. Letme tellyouagain. Ifyoudon'tprotectme-- His life was being threatened during the weapons deal. Our priority is to find out who his client was. We went to meet him right after the call. The big question is... how'd this client know we were meeting? Autopsy reports came out. From the first to the fourth cervical vertebrae... one bullet went through between the third and fourth... and the other penetrated between right and left atrium... which killed him instantly. The heart was completely destroyed. I've never seen anything like this before. Good-bye. Chodo Harbor, North Korea For the victory! For the victory! No more corrupt politicians! No more 50 years ofseparation, disgrace and humiliation! We're writing a new history of Korea! And the beginning ofit is in your hands! Good luck. For the unification. For the unification. For the unification. For the unification. Team 4, go! Don't move! He left nothing related to his business. No wonder. They destroy everything that could be used against them. It's hard to find any connection between Lim and Hee. Then we're back to square one. People around Lim? Lim took care of business by himself. Nobody knows anything. Hee's been hiding out for over a year. I don't get it. A weapons dealerwas her first target. It's too easy for her. Aren't we overreacting? Could it be a gang war imitating her? Nobody can imitate her. We need to find out what she wanted from him... and why he contacted us. What did Hee ask him for? What was the information Lim tried to give us? Ifshe hasn't gotten what she wanted from him yet... she'll try to get it through other channels. We need to focus on the fact that North Korea's using her again... even though her identity has been exposed to us. You two are the best agents we've got. Finish her atyour first opportunity. What doyou think was their relationship? Why'd she approach him? I guess she needed something from him. That's it.That thing she asked him to get her.That's the key. What'd he mean by something dangerous? You look awfully serious. We're late, come on. I got delayed at the beauty parlor. Haveyou waited long? Not long. How do I look? We'd better hurry. Did you sleep well? Did I snore? I was worried about that. He always sleeps at the theater. You two are here. He isn't into anything. He doesn't even like to sing or listen to music. Really? I grew up near the airport 'cause my old man was a pilot. So I can't tell a noise from a rhythm. Nothing's music to my ears. Then, what doyou like? I like looking for people. Lately I've been looking for my ex-girlfriend. What's she like? You want to take a look? She's cute. Why did you break up? So I can look for her. Gosh, I'm sorry. - No problem. - Wipe it offwith this. Here. - I am really sorry. - It's okay. It's punishment for dozing off in the theater. Excuse me. - When is your wedding day? - 20th ofnext month. When are you gonna tell her? - You can't hide it forever. - I don't wanna burden her. What about her? What if you die on a mission? - I can't anyway. - Why not? You don't trust her? Let me ask you something. If Hee and I point a gun at each other... and you have to choose one, who would that be? Hee, ofcourse. I'd save your ass 'cause I can bust her later. You don't get many chances. You don't get many friends you'd die for either. It's not too late, man. You can changeyour mind. Cheers. I'm all wet! Wait till that stain gets washed off. I've had it. Give me money for laundry. I'll pay for it when I do that again. - Aim well next time. - I'll try. - Where are all the taxis? - Let's take the subway. - In this rain? - You're wet anyway. Come on, let's run! You sure? It's gonna rain all night long. I like it. I don't think they do. It's bedtime for them. Looks like the rain woke them up. - What are they saying? - They want us to keep quiet. - How are your Kissingurami? - They fight a lot. One minute, they hate each other... next minute, they're hugging, kissing and stuff. They're always like that.When I go out, I get worried about them. IfI am not there, you have to take care ofthem. I don't think I can. I can't even handle "Kissing" and "Anabus" at home. That's why you have to learn more. To live with them, you have no choice. Your sweater is almost done. I hope it looks good on you. What should I getyou for the wedding? All I want is... whatever happens to me... you love and never leave me. That's all. Because you're the only one who truly understands me. Shiri, step one, on! Kim? He looks most suspicious on the transaction record. - Who's he? - National Defense lab researcher. As a part ofa new weapons system being developed... Kim speaking. Yes. Okay. we launched the CTX project lastyear. If Kim was doing business with the weapons dealer... chances are very high that it was CTX. Tell me more about the CTX. CTX is a new type ofenergy... originally invented by Korea Energy Development Lab. We've been working on turning it into a weapon. At first, we had problems with its delicate detonation conditions... but the test we did last month was successful. People atyour agency know about this too. It'll bring a sensational change to the military's weapons systems. How's it different from the conventional bombs? It's a liquid bomb. What's most amazing about CTX is that it's indistinguishable from water. When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color... and you can't detect the liquid itself with any devices. Yet the effect is ten times more powerful than... any other bombs you've ever seen. What ifa black-market dealer got it? He could get the information on it, but not the CTX itself... becauseyou need three or four approvals to release it. If Mr. Kim took a bribe to hand it over... he would've returned the money. Where's it made and kept? That's confidential. Sorry. But CTX has never been released until today. How are you so sure? When CTX is released... it goes through three authorization checkpoints... and this morning everything was in order. You're saying it was released this morning? For the weapon show tomorrow... it's being transferred to headquarters as we speak. Sera Mike 1, stopatDongsanservicearea. Will Hee turn up? She wants the CTX. She wouldn't miss this chance. Why are they bothering us? Theywant two secret agents to ride with us. What for? What the hell is that? Sir, we need to check the vehicles. I wasn't informed ofthis. What's going on? We got a report ofa possible interception ofCTX. Your permit and I D, please. The CTX is safe with us. Get out ofthe way. Didn'tyou hear me? I asked foryour permit and I D, didn't I? This is Sera Mike 1 , we're stopped at a checkpoint. I don't have time for this. I'll fax it toyou. Ifyou resist, we'll have to arrestyou. What did you say? We'll have to arrestyou... or kill you. - Areyou nuts? - I'm fine. Areyou out ofyour mind? You fucking moron! Areyou fucking nuts? Wait, look at this. What base areyou from? Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea! Sera Mike 1 , doyou copy? They've been hit! It's worse than we thought! It's a bomb! Run! Hee asked Lim for the CTX... and Lim bribed the researcher to hand it over. But when they realized it couldn't be done... they planned to intercept it on the road. In the process, Lim and Kim were murdered... along with 20 ofour armed guards. How much CTXwas taken? About a gallon. It is enough to blow up an entire city. Any leads on the interceptors? Notyet, sir.Just an assumption that they're involved with Hee. But whywould North Korea do that... in a time ofreconciliation? We haven't seen the hidden camera mounted on the vehicle... but the gunfire at the scene makes me think... that they're highly trained North Korean militants. Their military system is falling fast. It could be a private organization wanting the CTX for their own purpose. The question is, what are they planning to do with the CTX? Ifit blows up in Seoul, we're finished. We also need to figure out why their target was the CTX. As you all know, it may explode without the detonator. And no devices can detect the liquid itself. Ifthey utilize those traits, expect the worst. There's no way to predict when, where or how it's gonna go off. - Dinner? - I don't feel like it. Is the meeting over? - Little while ago. Anything special? Ready to order? - Hi. - Hi. - Beer, please. - Okay. What about the scene? An inspection ofthe scene was delayed and the bodies werejust taken to the headquarters. The film will be handed over tomorrow. Any leads? Just bodies and shells. Isn't it strange? Anything else? This is the third time.Lim, Kim. This time CTXwas intercepted. We went to see Lim right after the call... and to the lab right after we got the report. We're always a step behind. It's like theywere reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Don't jump to conclusions.Today we went to the lab without notice. Kim didn't even know that we were coming... and he got killed five minutes before we got there. If that's the case, it's obvious. Only Director Ko and I knew about those killings and the CTX. And you made the report. Shiri 1 's on line. It's been a long time. - How's my family? - They're fine. I miss them. Completion is near. You'll meet them soon. A barrier is in the way. Get rid ofit. Target? Kissingurami. Finish thejob before the completion. Acknowledged. For the unification. For the unification. We're always a step behind. They were reading our moves. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. - Hello? - It'sme, Ho. - Can I seeyou tomorrow? -Sure. What'sgoingon? I have a favor to ask. Call me at the police agency tomorrow. - Okay. - See you tomorrow. I'll call you. What are you doing there? You scared me! - You just got here? - No, earlier. I cleaned and did the laundry. Nothing was in the refrigerator. so I went grocery shopping. What's wrong? You don't look so good. Just busy at work. Why didn'tyou call? I was gonna leave soon.Dinner? Not yet.I had a late lunch. Let me fix dinner for us. - What are we having? - Your favorite. - You wanna take a shower? - After dinner. - I think it's done. - Let it simmer. Can you hand me the clothespins and hangers from the sofa? - I couldn't find the pins. - It's okay. Leave it, I'll do it. When are you moving in? Soon, I guess. I haven't packed upyet. - Let me help you pack up. - Okay. With you here, it won't be as lonely. You hated eating alone and waking up byyourself. You'll whisper in my ear to wake me up from now on. I'll make the coffee, and you'll play soft music. Should we buy birds? You'd like birds singing in the morning. Promise me, that you keep the promise you made to me a year ago. Trust me.I'll never drink again. Because I haveyou. Thesoccerteam of SouthandNorth Koreareturnedtoday... to the Seoul Training Center aftertraining in Pohang... with North Korean officials coming through "Panmunjum. " The North Korea President Lee and officials... coming to the south for the game and a conference... When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color. You can't tell the difference from waterwith the naked eye. But it's a different story with the light on. Turn it on. It's on. CTX responds to daylight... over 6,000 kelvin. The light alone may start its reaction. But without heat, it's no good. Fire. What? Yes, sir. It's on, sir. Ifyou expose it to both light and heat... nitro-alpha inside the sphere and beta outside react differently. But when the liquid in the sphere becomes red, the sphere pops. Nitro-alpha and beta combined causes the explosion. How much power does it have? This is about 200 cc, so everything within the radius of one kilometer would disappear. Since the detonation varies depending on the reaction... the sensor here tells you when it's exploding. Like now, ifthe sphere becomes red... it means the explosion is imminent. If you don't stop it before the sphere pops...it explodes. But with either light or heat removed, the reaction stops. I've never seen an agent like you in 20 years.You're an oddball. I am not, sir. - Admit it. - No, I am not. Admit it! Then I wouldn't be cleaning the fishbowls. AgentRyu, come toroom 17. I gotta go. Find the CTX as soon as possible so we can go drinking. We'll find it! Anyone recognize him? Don'tyou remember, Ryu? His name is Park.A top agent for the North Korean 8th special forces. When Ryu stormed the plane that'd been hijacked... he was the only one that escaped from the plane. A painful memory for Ryu. Clear! Hee and Park.All the pieces are coming together. Agent Lee? Find out what's going on with 8th special forces. And you get the daily data of spy satellites from National Defense. - Agent Yoon! - Yes, sir. Post Park's montage throughout the country. They're 8th special forces. It's worse than we expected. The 8th special forces intercepted the CTX. Why? Three possibilities here. First, to sell it off to a third country. Second, to use it on the negotiation table... for money or to seek asylum to another country. Third, a strategy they are known for... they say theywant peace and stab us in the back. It must be either for the money or an explosion. Iftheywanted the money, why CTX? Robbing the Bank of rang me to go to the hospital. When I arrived, the whole surgical team was waiting. Formonths, those faceshadlookedat me with indifference andimpotence. Nowthey were allsmiles. Thesame bastard who hadsaidmycase washopeless talkedabout an operation. Theyhada newrevolutionarysystem in the clinic now. Theysaidthat within two weeks my face wouldbe completely reconstructed. You didn �t believe them? Not at first. I thought it wasjust a way to get more money out of me. But they showed me all the gadgets for the operation. It lookedlikescience fiction. Alllcouldsee were cables, switches, monitors. Actually, lneverreally knew what they weregoing to do. But lthought I �dnothing to lose. Thosepeople were usedto rhinoplasties... liposuctions, hairtransplants, but my operation wasmuch more. ln less than a week... my life hadturnedaround. One night, I waslying on thegrounddrunk, waiting to die. The next morning, my dreams were coming true... like in the movies. Sofía loved me, and the doctors found the miracle cure. I don �t know. Obviously, I was suspicious. Suspicious? Ofwhom? Ofwhat? I don �t know. In life, you never know. Happiness comes when you least expect it. I once knew a guy who was alone in the world. Suddenly, he was married with two daughters. Fuck, you �ve got a strange idea of happiness. Well, that depends on the individual. What �s happiness foryou? What �s happiness foryou? Don �t ask any more stupid questions. But at that time, you were happy. Or weren �t you? So what? My life now is shit. All I can do is eat, shit, sleep and dream of my memories. It �s good that you remember. - Well? - Well, what? They were to remove the plates today. - And they did. - And? Well, my ears are where they should be. César, don �t scare me. - Take offthe plates. - You can do it. How did they do it? Wait.Just to say that I love you. You �re going too fast... considering we met yesterday. Yesterday? My birthday, don �t you remember? I met an incredible girl. Her name was Sofía. But today I woke up feeling great... and now I �m with the girl again. What is it? What is it? Ifyou want me to move, you have to put in a coin. Ting! We neverappreciate thegoodmoments tillthey �re over. Maybe that �s why they �regoodmoments. - We don �tstop to thinkabout them. - Perhaps. What happenedto Pelayo? - What �s up? - Hang on a minute. - That �s it. - About time. - Want anything else? - No, thanks. How �s things, Pelayo? Fine. How �s things, Pelayo? Fine. Yeah. I �m actually not as fucked up as I look. I �m used to you always winning, you bastard. - And Sofía isn �t that great. - You said she was ideal. Really? I was drunk. Anyway, we �re friends. Bastard! - What �s that on your face? - What? - Fuck, there �s a seam opening! - What are you on about? You fucking idiot! What �s the matter? I hate dreaming. You �re tickling me. What �s wrong? What is it? - Where �s Sofía? - What? What have you done with Sofía? - I am Sofía. - You bitch! - You �re mad. You �re mad. - Where is she? In one minute, I �m going to call the police. You �ll be in trouble ifSofía doesn �t appear. So you survived the accident. What accident? - Whose body was it? - I didn �t have an accident. No. It wasn �t an accident. It was attempted murder. A pity you didn �t see my face, bitch! - Why do this? How have I changed? - You haven �t. You �re the same lunatic who gate-crashed my party. I �m the girl you made love tojust now. I �m Sofía. Stop saying you �re Sofía, do you hear? Don �t say her name! You won �t tell me where she is. You never will. César. I love you. - Hello. - Hello. You can go. I �ll see to this. Right. Let me get this clear. - Where were you last night? - At home. I told that gentleman. At home. With whom? - With a girl. - The girl just questioned? No, that �s another girl. I was with Sofía. The girl I spoke to was Sofía. Yes, that �s what she says, but it �s a lie. - Who is she then? - She �s Nuria. Nuria what? I don �t know. She never told me her surname. Let �s see. You were at home with a girl called Sofía, and suddenly-- I go to the bathroom, come back, and she �s in Sofía �s place. Where �s Sofía? Ask Nuria. She �s pretending to be her. You don �t know her surname? But who do you believe, her or me? Listen, that girl �s papers are all in order. We �ve let her go. - You �ve what? - And I assure you she �s called Sofía. Sofía Cueto, and she lives at number 2, Quirós St. - No! - No, what? Well, yes, but that �s another girl. I know the real Sofía. Then tell me where she is. Because, legally the girl you �re talking about... only exists in your imagination. - I don �t believe this. - And another thing. The girl looks as ifshe �d been hit. She was in my house supplanting my girlfriend! I don �t know why, but she wouldn �t press charges. Fucking great! So now she �s the victim! Tell me. Are you on drugs? - God! - You were under psychiatric care. My face was destroyed in a car crash she caused! Your face looks fine. Because-- It doesn �t matter. I �ve got nothing more to say. Young man. I �d advise you to see a psychiatrist. Are you an idiot? - What the fuck is this? - What do you mean? Ifyou wanted to fuck her up, there are other ways to do it! - Keep away from Sofía! - It isn �t Sofía. It �s Nuria! Nuria �s dead! Calm down, oryou �ll be sleeping in a cell tonight! Don �t ever talk to me again! I don �t know what the cops told you, but Nuria is alive! The cops didn �t tell me, Sofía did. Listen, you spoke to her by phone, didn �t you? - Let go! - It wasn �t Sofía. Nuria can imitate her voice. She took her ID, her apartment. It wasn �t over the phone. I �vejust dropped her home. She looked like this. Nice photo, isn �t it? You going to say that isn �t Sofía? But that �s-- Is this a joke or what? You �re crazy, man. I �m crazy? I �m crazy? You �re the ones who are mad! You �re all mad! Let go of me! God, what �s happening? It �s my partners, right? They �ve paid you. This is a plot! Look at yourself. You haven �t been right since the accident. Fuckyou! Are you saying-- Are you saying this is the girl you ran after the other night? - Is this your ideal girl? - Yes! And you took her. You need a psychiatrist! Problems? I �m in no mood, sojust-- There �s an explanation for all this. César. Who are you? - You �ve seen me on TV. - What do you want? I �m here to help you. First ofall, it �s very important that you calm down. Calm down? You must overcome your fears and regain control. What control do you mean? I �m fine. Who says you aren �t? They do. All ofthem. They think I �m mad. No, ofcourse you �re not mad. But what if I told you you were dreaming? No, no, no. Why not? - I know what �s real, and this is real. - How do you know? You discoveryour dreams when you wake. I just know. - My dreams are much simpler than this. - No dream is simple. Look at those people. They seem to be talking about their own business. Completely unaware ofyou. And yet, they could be there because you wanted it. What �s more, you could have them at your complete service... or have them destroy you. I want them to be quiet. And you, too. See? What �s going on here? Someone tell me the fucking truth! The truth? Maybe you couldn �t take it. It had to be a setup, a bigjoke to drive me crazy. They all knew. Nuria, Pelayo, the police, the guy at the bar. - Who was he? - I don �t know. You said you saw him on TV. On what program? I don �t know! I don �t know. One that talked about freezing the dead. - Freezing the dead? - Cryonization. Like they did to Walt Disney. Maybe I can help you remember. Is that a threat? Lie down. What �s that? A syringe. Relax. My arm �s stinging. It �s a tranquilizer. What for? These things are all bullshit. Ifyou �d trusted psychiatrists more, you mightn �t be here now. That finger, it �s making me nervous. You needn �t be afraid. - I �m not afraid. - Stop talking and concentrate. Come on. Fuck. I feel dizzy. Good-bye, César. Verygood. Nowlet �ssee ifyou can tellme about that dream. - ln my dream, it isn �t raining. - The office dream. Eli. That �s it. I wantyou to tellme who Eli is. -A secretary. - Eli isa secretary? She tellsme togo in. They �re expectingme. Who �s expectingyou? - The Frenchman from the TV. - Sit down, please. It �sa contract. - Eli-- - César, who is Eli? You won �t regret it. Sign. - What areyousigning? - Eli willsee to everything. What haveyousigned? What �s wrong? What �s wrong, César? Whyareyou crying? - l �mgoing to die. - You �re notgoing to die. - ldon �t knowhowmany. - Howmany what? - Pills. - You tookpills? - Howmanyshouldltake? - Pills to feelbetter? ldon �t want to. When lcount to three, you �ll wake up. One. Two. I thought that, up to now, you �d told me the truth. What do you mean? You said you took nothing. César, I �ll askyou for the last time. - Did you take drugs? - Fuck! Why does everyone-- Stop playacting. Tell me the truth! - I must know what you took. - I didn �t take anything! Don �t you see? Your brain could have been affected by the pills. - I didn �t take any! - You said you did! It �sjust a dream! Why make it more important than it is? Can �t you tell dreams from reality? I can! Really? Don �t make me laugh! Bodies that come to life, people who disappear... you, the Phantom ofthe Opera! Tell me one thing. Do you remember what you did to Sofía? It wasn �t Sofía. I don �t care who it was. What did you do to her? You remember? My God! What are you doing? I thought you were a burglar. Who are you? I �m Sofía. Sofía. You �re not Sofía. César, this will all be over soon. We �ll be together again. You �ll forget Nuria and I won �t be afraid ofyou. - I �m thirsty. - I �ll get some water. Sofía! Yes, César, I �m Sofía. I �m Sofía. I want to see you. I want to see you. I want to see you! I want to see you! At times you dream you �re with someone. For example, your father. In seconds, he becomes your mother... and then, the news vendor on the corner. Yet you still feel as if you �re talking to the same person. You thought you were at home, but suddenly you realize you �re in a school. Or a hospital, or a prison. Dreams are like that. And at times the mind behaves as if it were in a dream. - You know what derangement is? - For fuck �s sake! Say I �m stupid ifyou want, but this isn �t derangement! Then what is it? You tell me, because I don �t know. I don �t know what �s in here, or why you killed your girlfriend. I don �t know who Eli is, or that man from the TV. - I don �t know anything. - That makes two of us. Will you still come after the trial? Don �t you hate the sight of me? - What will you plead? - Why do you ask that? The first hearing is next week. Temporary derangement. It �s your best chance. Even so, it won �t be much use. They won �t believe me. Even I don �t believe it. What do you believe? I thinkyou �re very sick and should stay here for a long time. Don �t worry. I �ll get at least 20 years. César, you may not believe it, but I care about you. I care a lot about you. Look, kid. Your case interests me. I �m sorry about what �s happened. I even thought someone was playing tricks on you, but... I can �t and mustn �t exceed my duties. - I �m just a psychiatrist. - You don �t look like one. - What do I look like? - My father. Preaching at me all day. Your father �s dead. There you go. By the way, what happened to that man with the wife and two daughters? I don �t know. I never saw him again. Take my advice, get a lawyer. Good-bye, César. Good-bye. ...the main Spanish investment, but certainlythe most novel. ...its economicpresence in Cuba. ...depending on the era. ln the Roman Empire, forexample, the normalthing was to live... only25years. Who �s got the remote? Give it to me! Get it off him! What �s up? There �s a computer here connected to Internet. They �ll only let me use it ifyou come with me. - Why do you want Internet? - I know what Eli is. Wait! Eli isn �t a person, it �s a company. - How do you know? - It isn �t Eli. It �s L.E. They �re the initials ofan American company. - What are you doing? - Checking the "initials program." It �ll tell us all it knows about L.E. Shit! - It �ll take ages. - No, wait. Fuck! I feel like I �ve done this before. A cerebral dysfunction. A lapse in the brain. No, not this time. My God! - That �s it. - The photo in your dream? I had to see it before I could dream about it, right? "Cyronics." - Cryonization. - I �ll print this. Wait a minute. I don �t see what this has to do with your case. The key is in here. Look, there �s an office in Madrid. I �ll go and check it out. No! I have to go, too. - I can �t get you out of here. - I �d be let out under supervision. Make up some excuse. - It isn �t easy. - You can do it. You know something else, don �t you? I don �t know anything. - I �vejust got a feeling. - What is it? I have to go there, one way or another. Let �s get things straight. We �re outside, I �m armed. Myjob is to stop you doing anything stupid. Try anything, and you get a bullet. I �ve been here before. - This way. - Move. You �ve got 20 minutes. It �sjust like in my dream. Good morning. Can I help you? Well, actually, we wanted to speak to Mr. Duvernois. He �s my son. He �s very shy. Mr. Duvernois isn �t here right now. But, first ofall, do you know what cryonization is? Well, more or less. Here are some leaflets. You can read them while you �re waiting. One of my colleagues will be with you soon. Thankyou. "Live without limits. Tomorrow is for the foresighted." What is this? Some kind ofsect? "Cryonization is the biostasis or preservation of human beings. It is the bridge to carry our patients to a future... when technology will restore them to life." You pay to live eternally. They laughed atJules Verne. César, all this is absolutely impossible. What do you know ofthe future? They promise what the Church has always promised. Immortality. Except they �re quacks, not priests. How are you involved? You �re not cryonized. You �re alive. This is the contract, ifyou want to look at it. The procedure is very simple. You could die at any time. Today, tomorrow, in 20 years. It doesn �t matter to us. At the very moment you �re declared legally dead... Life Extension transfers your body to our store in Arizona. There, it �s frozen at minus 78 degrees. We call that "total suspension," and it costs $240,000. 30,000 pays for the freezing process, and the rest... goes into an investment fund... the interests from which pay for maintenance... and resurrection costs, the day that it �s possible. If it is possible. We believe that the reanimation ofthe dead will be possible. - What �s this? - What? Clause 1 4. Artificial perception. It �s a concept that we haven �t fully developed yet. Look. This is a life. Birth and death. Let �s say you �ve got a terminal illness. Ofcourse you want to go on living, but not in the future. That doesn �t interest you. You want to live your life now. Very well. You die, we freeze you... and when we can resuscitate you, we �ll have you live... a dream. - A dream? - It will all look real. Your family and friends, your city... the world, even this office. But it �ll be a virtual reality. What �s more, we �ll make you forget that you �ve died... and that you signed this contract. - How? - Very simple. Wiping it from your memory. You �ll live your life linearly, as if nothing had happened. And best ofall, you �ll live it as you like, as you wish. You �ll decide at all times. But what ifthere were mistakes? What ifthe dream was transformed into a nightmare? Well, the subconscious can always play a dirty trick. But we �re not cowboys. This is a serious company. And virtual reality technology is constantly making huge advances. Look. I �ll be honest. Signing Clause 1 4 is like signing for paradise. It �s hard to believe. But they laughed atJules Verne. Excuse me. - Where are you going so fast? - To the bathroom. - Well, not so fast. - I �ll go with him. Hejust felt ill, don �t worry. César, calm down, please. This is a dream. It �s the only explanation. What he said is impossible. In the 20th century, but maybe not in the 30th. - Maybe not, but we �re in 1 997. - That �s what it seems. - I paid for it to seem like that. - Listen! Ifthis is a dream-- Look at me! Ifthis is a dream, it means that I don �t exist! - I just imagine you. - No! - César, I �m real. - How do I know that? Can �t you tell a dream from reality? Is this a dream, eh? Tell me, is this a dream? César, I �m wearing myselfout over this case. There is no case. I didn �t kill anyone. It �s all a nightmare. Fuck it, César, trust me! This isn �t a dream. - They got it wrong. - Who? I don �t know! But they mixed up Sofía and Nuria! I see a face that isn �t mine. I �m sick of hearing that! Your face is fine. You �re behaving like a child, hiding behind that mask. - Go on, take it off! - I don �t want to see myself! I don �t care about that. I want to see you. Don �t you realize? All that matters is what I see! It �s my dream! Say that once more and I �ll have you locked up in an asylum. Show me your face. Now. You owe it to me. César, look in the mirror and tell me ifyou thinkyou �re disfigured. God! Why do you keep seeing what isn �t there? - You look fine. - I �m a monster! What do you mean? Anybody �d like to have your face. You look normal. Notjust normal. You �re handsome! César, listen. Maybe you �ve got something like anorexia. Some girls insist they �re fat and end up crazy. César! I want to wake up! I want to wake up! - Hold it! - I want to wake up! Fuck! Shit! - Freeze! - Don �t shoot! This is a nightmare! It �s a nightmare! You! Wait a minute! You �re not to leave! Stop! Wait a minute! It �s a dream! It �s a dream! Don �t move! Drop the gun! - I want to wake up. I want to wake up. - Don �t move! I want to wake up! Antonio. Antonio! What? You �re crushing me. I �d better not move. I �ve been shot in the back. How do you know? Well... because-- What �s going on here? What the fuck �s going on? I told you, it �s a dream. Shut up! Shut up! I know what this is. It �s one ofthose Candid Camera jokes. You did a greatjob, I loved it, but enough �s enough! - I see someone. - Where? Up there, on the roof. I can �t see a thing. Where are you going? Come on, Antonio. Don �t think about it anymore oryou �ll go crazy. Hello, César. It �s time I introduced myself. My name is Serge Duvernois. I represent Life Extension. We met... 1 50 years ago. What? Has the world gone mad? There �s no world. It �s all in that gentleman �s mind. Including you and me. Sure! Shall I thump you to see if it hurts? Try it. They can make you disappear right now, like everyone else. - And who are "they," may I ask? - The company. Life Extension. They know everything we �re saying. They know what is going through César �s mind an instant after he thinks it. Ifthey can make me disappear, why haven �t they done it? It would be virtually incorrect. You �vejust saved his life. Virtually incorrect? Do you think I �m an idiot or what? No, quite the opposite. You �re a great guy. A character who is very necessary for César. A character? - Where are you going? - To look for someone. There is no one. People aren �t necessary now. Why didn �t you wake me before? You only had to ask. But that was difficult. Because, in theory, you wouldn �t know you were dreaming. Since when? Remember the day ofthe discotheque? That night, whenyou fellasleep on thesidewalk... was the one chosen forthesplice. Whatsplice? Thesplice betweenyourreallife andyour virtuallife. A splice of150years whichyou didn �t notice... becauseyou were dead andfrozen. From whenyou woke up... nothing wasreal. We wiped what really happened from your memory. What was it? You never saw Sofía again. And the doctors were never able to rebuild your face. You woke up on thatstreet with an awfulhangover. Youshutyourselfaway formonths. One dayyou learned that we existed. You came to the office, yousignedthe contract... andthen... you killedyourself. lpaidforthis? I paid for Nuria to come back as Sofía? I paid to look like a monster again? I paid to live this nightmare? You paid to live whateveryou wanted. Wejust provided the setting and the characters. You invented your hell. I tried to warn you in that bar. I said it all depended on your mind. Do I just have to want it? - Can Antonio come-- - There �s no one here. They can �t have made 4 million people disappear! You �ve overcome your fears. Ifyou want, we can try again... have you live a wonderful dream... with money, friends, Sofía, or whatever girl you want. You just have to ask. I don �t want more dreams. It isn �t a dream! César, listen to me. This is real. This man is a sham. Let �s go down and look for people. Ignore him. It �s logical for him to behave like this... but he doesn �t feel anything. I don �t feel anything? I don �t feel anything? What do you know about what I feel? Ignore him, he isn �t real. Yes, I am real! I �ve got a wife and two daughters. His personality is designed so that he �ll say all this now. Where are my daughters? God! César, we can offeryou another possibility. In 1 997, it was impossible to rebuild your face. But out there, it �s the year 2 1 45. You wouldn �t believe the things surgery can do. You could wake up... and live in the future like a normal person. - In the future? - You have to choose. How could I wake up? How would you wake from your worst nightmare? No, César, don �t listen to him! Your partners set this up! They want you to kill yourself! He �s done that. Now it �ll just be a formality. - I �m going to do it. - Very well. Do you have any wish before you die? Let them out there read my mind. Who are you? I don �t know. Don �t keep suffering. It �s all in your head. It �s all psychological. Come on, César. - What will happen to them? - Don �t prolong this farewell. You think they �re your friends, but they �rejust images. That man isn �t really crying. - I forgot, I get vertigo. - Then don �t look. Good-bye, César. Relax. Relax. Openyoureyes. -Hey, thanks for that interview, Barry. -No problem. Excuse me, do you have change for the phone? Sure, yeah. What, do you need me to break a million? Come on. What's with you reporters always getting on me about my salary? It's funny, calling $7 million a salary. What do you make? That's kind of personal. Exactly. But what you make is news, because it's so gigantic. What do you make, really? About, say, $50,000 a year? Yeah, about that. Okay, that's two columns a week, about eight columns a month. About $500 a column. -lt is? -Yeah, it's $1 a word. For every little word like "the" and "a," if you hit the letter "a," it's $1. I guess I'm doing all right then. -You see? -Yeah. Can I borrow a quarter for the phone? -Here, take two. -Thanks. Hi, I'm Ray, and I live here in Long lsland with my wife Debra. She's great with the kids, the house, everything. I don't know how she does it. We've got a daughter Ally... and twin two-year-old boys. It's not really about the kids. My parents live across the street. That's right. And my brother lives with them. Now, not every family would go by on a conveyor belt for you... but mine would because-- Everybody loves Raymond. Yeah. -Hey. -Hey. -Want some sandwich? -Hey! No, it's okay. Ma, I need construction paper. Ally's making valentines for school. I used to love Valentine's Day. Then I met your father. I used to love every day. Anybody see today's paper? -Why? What's up? -I'm in it. "Large male seeks any woman." I discontinued my ad. And I happen to have a girlfriend now, thank you very much. -It's in the Metro section. -Let me see. Here you are. Do you see who's at the other end of those handcuffs? My God. Leon. Look, Frank, your friend, Leon. You arrested Leon? My Leon? Technically, now the State of New York's Leon. I've known this guy 40 years. Since when is it a crime to sell merchandise... at far below wholesale prices? You should've seen his warehouse. Fake designer luggage, imitation jewelry, "Macin-tush" computers. Hey, wait a minute. Didn't you buy my engagement ring from Leon? Relax. He assured me it's a one-of-a-kind, flawless diamond. -That's a fake. -It's a fake? How do you know that's a fake? Because I have 300 more exactly like them down at the station. I want another ring, Frank. You lived 40 years with that one, you can live another 10. I don't think so, Frank. I'm going shopping. You'll be amazed at your generosity. -Oh, my God. -What? -Debra's ring is from Leon, too. -You went to Leon? I listened to him. I was just trying to get more for my money. I wanted to get Debra a ring that she could show her mother. And Leon threw in a set of golf clubs. I got snow tires. What did I do? I can't have Debra think... I didn't care enough about her to go to a real jeweler. -She's wearing glass! -It's not glass. It's glassette. I gotta do what's right. I gotta replace her stone with another one. A real one. I'll spend $1,000 if I have to, that's all, $2,000. $2,000 for a diamond? -Hey, I know another guy-- -No more guys. You're just gonna have to tell your wife... you purchased her a discount engagement ring from a crook. I can't let her find out. She's going to think I'm a slimeball. I'll have to steal it from her. -Hey, here you go. -Oh, good. Thanks, Daddy. Hey, look at all these valentines. -Where's Daddy's? -You gotta get yours from Mommy. -I've been trying to get mine from her for-- -All right. I got your valentine right here. I love you. I love you? A little wine with lunch? Well, tomorrow's Valentine's Day. Sweetie, did you know that Daddy asked me to marry him on Valentine's Day? What did you say? Well, I thought about it, but I said "yes" anyway. I love your daddy very much. And I love Mommy. -Hey. -Hey. Let me help you with that. What are you doing here? -Did you get the ring yet? -No. She never takes it off. I'm going to need a bone saw. Just don't say anything, all right? Nothing. Yeah, it's all about you, Raymond. Debra, I have to ask your advice on something. -Sure, Robert. -I've been out with Amy on four dates now. Am I obligated to get her something for Valentine's Day? Well, if it helps you, she's getting you something. -That doesn't help me. -No. -You know what her favorite color is? -Green, I think. Green? Good. What does she weigh? I don't know. But you know what? Most women like jewelry. Yeah, jewelry's a great gift. Isn't it, Raymond? You really can't go wrong with jewelry. Ally, let's get some envelopes for these. What are you talking about jewelry for? She brought it up. Debra. Honey. Have you been gaining weight? Hi. Want to play Baker in the Mineshaft? Okay. But I get to be the baker this time. -Good morning. -Morning. -Hey, that was fun last night. -Yeah. You're very romantic, Ray. I love the way you kept holding my hand. Yeah, that's the way I do it. Ray. What? -Happy Valentine's Day. -Yeah. You, too. Can you hand me a towel, Ray? Ray? Amy, help me look. -I just came by.... What are we looking for? -My engagement ring. I might not be the best person to help. I've spent the last 10 years looking for an engagement ring. It couldn't have just disappeared. I mean.... You know what they say, "lt'll be the last place you look." Of course it'll be the last place I look... because once I find it, I won't have to look for it anymore. -I'm sorry, I'm just a little-- -Bitchy? Yeah. Maybe I'll do the kitchen again. Saw your car. Thought I'd say hi to Debra before our date. Hi, Debra, what are you doing? She can't find her ring. I don't know anything about it. Here. Happy Valentine's Day. Thank you. It's a tie. See the pattern? I picked it out just for you. Little guns. Smith Wesson 686, with a two-pound trigger pull. Standard police issue. I love it. Okay, all right. And here, that's for you. Oh, Robert. Look, Debra, Robert got me something. Yeah, good for you. If anybody needs me, I'll be in the den pulling up carpeting. Hope you like it. Oh, my. Surprise. It's an iguana. With an iguana, you really don't have to say "surprise." Yeah. Debra told me that green was your favorite color... and, you know, the iguanas are the most loyal of all the reptiles, and.... Check him out. He's a lovely guy. He's very, very docile. Did you find my ring? Just a lizard. Honey? Debra? Ray? Hi. Here you go. Happy, you know.... These are beautiful. I cried, too. Roses are twice as much on Valentine's Day. Listen, Ray... I have something to tell you. I've looked everywhere, but I.... I think I've lost my engagement ring. All right, don't worry. I'm sure it will turn up. Did you look in the sofa? I don't think I'm going to find it. God, I knew this was going to happen one day. -All right. Don't worry. -No, listen, Ray. I have a confession to make to you. Right after we got engaged... I had the original stone replaced. What? Honey, when you asked me to marry you... I was so happy, believe me, but... that diamond.... I mean.... I knew you got the best stone you could afford, bless your heart, but.... You know, my parents weren't that crazy about you to begin with, and... I didn't want to show them that stone. I understand. You know my grandmother, Abby? She'd given me her ring years before... so I put that stone in your setting. Do you remember how much it was worth? Just ballpark? Sweetie, it's not important. How important is it not? -What? -How much was old Abby's stone worth? $15,000. I could just kill myself, Ray. This could be a murder-suicide. -I gotta keep looking for it. -Yeah.... No, stop looking. Listen, we have to be realistic, okay? The ring is gone. All right? Listen. You made a mistake, that's all. Everybody makes a mistake. You know, you're lucky... 'cause you're married to a guy who doesn't care about those things. Don't lift that cushion. Stop torturing yourself! It's gone, that's all. Look.... You know what we both could use right now? Pie. Let's have a little pie with.... Okay, you're right. I gotta stop thinking about it. Maybe it's in the.... Oh, my God, you found it! Give it to me. Oh, God! -Oh, Ray. -Yeah. What a happy moment now. Oh, sweetie, come here. When you first gave me this ring... I just knew we were going to be together forever. Keep that in mind. You put it on me, okay? Go on, put it on. -Oh, my God. -There you go. What did you do? I meant well. You changed the stone in my ring. Where is my grandmother's diamond? Just like Grandma. Gone. -You threw it out? -I didn't know that it was a $15,000 diamond. I thought it was just a piece of junk. So you knew that the first ring you bought me was a piece of junk? I was trying to get you more for the money, that's all. -This is your fault, anyway. -My fault? That's right. If you had just been honest enough to tell me that you changed it... then I wouldn't have had to steal it from you. Well, you're a great thief, Ray. You just threw out $15,000. Who did you get this stone from? Leon? How dare you? -How could you do this to me? -Because I was trying to fix the whole thing! Why, after eight years, did you try to fix it now? Because I love you! -Why did you change it eight years ago? -Because I love you! Mommy, Daddy. Honey, you're supposed to be getting ready for bed now. Look what I found in my backpack. What is it? A valentine. Kenny gave it to me. -That's really sweet, honey. -It's stuck with gum. Kenny blew a big bubble and put it in there for me. -He must really like me. -Yeah, that's sweet. Why don't you go up and get ready for bed, and we'll be right there, okay? Look at that. A wad of gum on a piece of paper. Yeah. Cheap bastard. Can we take a break? -My eyes are burning. -Not until we find the diamond. Here's a ring finger. Sometimes I feel time slip like a heartbeat, dear Angel... and I wonder if you feel it too, across the distance. To have known you for so brief a time... to live with the possibility that we shall never meet again. Killean marie Haskel's passing... is a lesson to us all. She was a selfless friend, a loving mother. Her life was hard, but it was her own. She did not surrender to sadness or hardship. She surrendered to the fatigue... that comes with being a good person. Killean found no peace in this world. we pray the Lord helps her find some in his. Ashes to ashes... dust to dust... we commit the body of Killean marie Haskel to the earth. No. No! Stop it! - Just you and me now. - Stop it! No! Stop it! Please stop. Hell, Maddie, he wasn't coming up to read you winnie-the-Pooh. But this isn't the way we talked about. You said you were just gonna make him tell us where he is. What do you want from me? Just be quiet. Evening, Officer. The reason I pulled you over is you have a burned-out taillight. Oh, yeah. I got a fix-it ticket for that last week. I'm just waitin'on payday to get it done. - Can I see your license, please. - Oh, yeah. I have it right here. what the hell was that? If you are indeed lost to me... it is my Lord's prayer that you are not lost to him, dear Angel... that you walk in the light... that you forgive... and that you never have to know the truth. I'm being attacked by a tiger. - No, I'm a lion. - A lion? You wanna play again? Yeah, but this time I'm a bear. A bear? You just better promise not to scare me. - Okay? - Okay. What's going on up here? The whole house is shaking. There's a wild animal in the house. - Mommy? - Yes, sweetie? Are you and Daddy gonna have another baby? - Uh, I don't know. - I want a baby. - You do, huh? - Yeah. Families have lots of kids. Some families, they have one, and some families have more. - They're still a family. - Yeah. But can I have a sister? I hope it's for me. - Hello? - Frank, please. Hi, sweetheart. You can hang up now, Jordan. - Okay. - Thank you. - Frank, it's Peter Watts. - Hi, Peter. I just sent you something you should see. Are you online? Yeah. Familiar face? Jake Waterston. Kidnapped, raped and murdered three nurses. Newport News, 1992. Strangled 'em with ten-pound test line. - Threw 'em into the James River. - He's surfaced. Living under the name ofjim Gilroy in joplin, missouri for the past five years. Where'd he turn up? A Missouri state trooper was shot last night point-blank. The car at the scene was registered toJim Gilroy. State police lifted his prints out of his house and sent them out on the N.C.I.C. They matched Waterston's. We picked it up here. Let's make sure we don't lose him again. Think he's all right back there? Couldn't say. Well, when are we gonna pull over and ask him where he is? Don't worry about it. Okay? We just gotta find a back road out of this state, and we'll be fine. Think Jim'll tell us where he is? Maddie! He's gotta be damn sure I will kill him if he doesn't. So just back off. Hell, I'm doing everything I can for you. You have to appreciate Jim Gilroy's discipline. A man of his impulses able to keep quiet these past five years. He wasn't unknown to local P.D., but, uh, he never broke a law. He was facing multiple murder charges, capital punishment. He'd gone underground successfully. Why risk it? Unit 41, I copy. Good morning. Can I help you gentlemen? We're expected, Officer. Is Captain Bigelow inside? Yes, sir. I'm Captain Bigelow, Missouri State Police. Peter Watts. This is Frank Black. You know this guyJim Gilroy who shot my trooper? We know him by another name... but yes, Frank pursued him while working at the F.B.I. How violent is this fugitive? He murdered three women in Virginia over Labor Day weekend. The funerals were closed casket. The morticians were unable to satisfactorily reconstruct the bodies. - He won't get away from us. - You see this? Scratched on the TV. What the hell does that mean? I don't know. There's blood residue in the bathtub. A woman died here recently. Unrelated to this, as far as we know. - Who? - Killean Haskel. She bled to death in the bathtub. They buried her yesterday. -A suicide? - That's what the coroner concluded. You might want to reconsider that. Is this Killean Haskel's husband? Must have been. She was divorced as far as I know. - Did she have any children? - Yeah. A daughter. Madeline Haskel, 20 years old. She lived here too. we haven't located her yet. Hmm. Stop it! Stop! Has this blood been typed and cross-matched? We assumed it was the mother's. I'll get a tech to take a sample. - I think it's important we find the daughter. - She involved? An inordinate amount of violence and suffering has occurred in this house. She might know something that could help us. Dear Angel, I was just thinkin'today of momma... how she had the softest, quietest voice you ever heard... like a willow in a breeze. In church, when she sang... people standin'around her would hush just to get a better listen. I can't help thinkin'how sad all this would have made her. She never liked Bobby much... and, for whatever reason, I fell in love with him. He paid attention to me... made me feel pretty. I saw him sittin'on the hood of his Firebird late one summer night... in high school. He was one of those types of people who acted fearless... like he had a secret. I never had secrets. momma had a hard life. Guess I'm kinda glad you weren't around to see her hurt like she did. I'm not sayin'this... like it's an excuse for anything that happened. just that, well... I never wanted to be one of those people that gets too used to bein'sad. That must sound funny comin'from me. Love, maddie. Where is he? Where is he? Answer me! - Answer me. - I don't know! - Happy birthday, sweetie. - Happy birthday, maddie. - Make a wish. - Stop! All right! I'll tell you. I'll tell you. The trooper took the proper approach, did everything accordingly. But he never saw the gun. Been over it a hundred times. Stop it there. Pan right. Do you have your report here? That's a complete forensic rundown from the scene, including ballistics. - Mmm. - Stop there. Killer used armor-piercing rounds. They penetrated the vest just enough to cause death by hydrostatic shock. His internal organs were destroyed by the shock waves from the impact. You know what's wrong with this M.O., Peter? Jim Gilroy never used a gun. How'd he kill those women? Garroted. Cut. I'm gonna enlarge it. What are you trying to say? Are you saying Jim Gilroy's not the killer? The man you know as Gilroy is the man we know as Jake Waterston. He's not an unintelligent man. He's neither rash nor careless. If he had no reason to believe his new identity was being threatened... he wouldn't act impulsively. Go back. - Did you see that? - Movement. - Something picked up the light. - I'm not sure I see it. Someone's sitting in the passenger seat. - Gilroy. - Gilroy is six-two. That person is much smaller. The crime scene report describes two different blood samples taken at the scene. One was the trooper's- - B-negative. The other's A-negative. The second sample, the A-negative-- that's Gilroy's blood type. There was no evidence that Gilroy was wounded at the shooting. We considered he may have been injured earlier. - I'm not sure that Gilroy's behind the wheel. - Who's the passenger, then? - It could be the daughter, Maddie Haskel. - Hmm. If Gilroy isn't driving the car and he's not the passenger, then where the hell is he? Maddie, wake up. Wake up. We're here. Hello? - Hi. It's me. - How are you, sweetheart? Good. Just tired. just called to say good night. jordan asleep? - She tried to stay awake for your call. - I'm sorry. - How's it going? - Fine. You have to do better than that. Just frustrated. Local officer was killed. Situation's very tense. Do you have a suspect? - Local P.D. think they do, but I disagree. - Why? I came down here looking for a man I've chased before... but something else is going on. Another crime is being committed, maybe. You're in this guy's head pretty deep, then. No, somewhere else. There's a young woman involved. I believe she's with the killer, but an innocent. Why is she with him? That's what I need to know. Get some sleep, Frank. Hey, I love you. Me too. Talk to you tomorrow. Yeah. What's got into Lottie? No idea. What in the Sam Hill are you barking' at, girl? Me. Who are you? - what do you want? - Where is he? Where's who? How'd you get in here? Don't move. Just tell me where he is, and I'm gone. I don't know what you're talkin' about. You get the hell outta here. Fred? Fred! - What'd you do? - Nothin'. - Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! - Shut up. Shut up! Don't make me hit you, Maddie! Maddie, he wasn't there. He wasn't there. Gilroy lied to us. Truth or dare, brother. Tell us where to find Angel. And this time it better be the truth. Don't be brave, man. Be smart. Where is he? You'll kill me either way. Just tell us where he is, for God's sake! Tell us where he is! - Please! - Get off. - Tell us where he is! - Get her off me! - Tell us where he is! - Get her off me! Maddie, getting hysterical, that ain't gonna help! Wait! Wait, I'll tell ya. I'll tell ya. Dear Angel, I was at church Easter Sunday... and the minister was talkin' about the mystery of faith... how easy it is to doubt what you can't prove... and how even though none of us saw the miracle in the Lord's tomb that day... alls we had to do was believe in it hard enough and it would be true. And that's what faith was. He said that we can't be weak... that we can't dismiss the miracle... that we have to be strong enough to make mysteries real. I wish you'd been sitting there with me that day. I can't see you. I can't touch you... but you are always in my heart. Love, maddie. '`Dear Angel... '`I never told you about the night you left. '`I'd gone out for groceries, and when I came home you were gone. '`I was terrified. I was lost. '`I couldn't get a straight answer out of anybody. '`I must have driven for hours looking for you... '`but there was no sign. '`I got tired, and I kinda gave up. '`I'm sorry. I'm sorry I gave up on you that night. Please forgive me. " '`Dear Angel, it's ehristmas eve. '`I remember when I was ten years old... '`and caught momma putting presents under the tree. '`Broke my heart. '`Believing in Santa was the last bit oflittle kid mystery left in the world. '`I'm looking up at the dark winter sky right now wishing that weren't true... '`wishing that old guy in the red suit would bring you home. '`I miss you so much. '`I gotta go. He hates it when I write to you, and I can hear him comin'up the stairs. " Anything? Just some letters that were never sent. - Who's the addressee? - I think they're to her father. Records show the father's name is John Haskel. - He split. Long gone. - He left some deep wounds. Maybe that's where they're headed. Maybe. - We located Jim Gilroy's car. - Where? Two hours south of here in Springdale, Arkansas. - Need a hand? - I'm righting'it up right now. Got a call from the caretaker. He was, uh, comin' by to drop off some fertilizer-- How long ago? Three hours ago, maybe a little more. Get it out of there. - What's the rush? - Frank it up, Roy. - Let's go! - Get on back! Get on back. It's Jim Gilroy. Get a stretcher over here! Where's the main house from here? About a hundred yards over there, but there's nobody home. Here we go. Get him on. - They're dead, aren't they? - Yeah. - We're right back where we started. - No. Now we have someone to talk to. We're gonna find him. - You happy? - Yeah. - Then prove it. - Bobby, no. Bobby, stop it. No! Bobby, stop! Please! I've never been clear on why they call it '`makin'love. " Every time I let Bobby have me... it felt more like-- like makin'peace. You know, killin'-- killin' time. A few precious minutes to myself. I found out my real dad had hit my mom a couple times. Then she took up with Jim and... he just hit her more often. I can't stop blaming' myself for what happened to my mom. When she found out whatJim had done to me... she just-- she couldn't live with it. I know I'm guilty for letting what happened happen... but if I didn't stay in that car... I knew I'd never see Angel again. - I ain't talkin' - Who put you in the trunk? I don't remember. Do you know who killed the Nesmiths? - Never heard of'em. - They were the people who lived on that farm. I don't know nothin'. I was in the trunk. Remember? - Why'd they try to kill you? - Hey, could I get a soda? - Who is Maddie riding with? - What's that? You know who she is. No, I don't. - I know you. - Really? You used to live at 898 Gaston Place... Newport News, Virginia. You worked at a mill by the docks. You drove a '73 Impala. Your name is Jake Waterston, and you killed three women there. So you have no reason to lie. I want to help you. Really, I do. They beat me, left me in a trunk. If it wasn't for that air pocket, I'd be dead. Did you think of that? Yeah. But not the way you do. who's riding with maddie? The little ditch weed was with her boyfriend Bobby Webber. why did webber assault you? 'Cause I wasn't ready for him. - What did you do to Maddie? - Nothin'. You killed her mother. Killean was a hothead. She committed suicide. You let her. You watched. You perpetrated the abuse on Maddie. Who's Angel? - What do you have, Peter? - I've located Maddie's father. Where? He was an inmate at the Fond du Lac Correctional Institute For Men in Waupun, Missouri. He died there a year ago. Where is he buried? No one claimed the body. The Department of Corrections leases some plots... in a potter's field area near the prison. The grave is unmarked. So, either she doesn't know that her father is dead, or she's-- She's after something else. The Newport News, Virginia D.A. sends his best. He's starting extradition proceedings in the morning... to get Waterston back for trial. He didn't get away this time, Frank. This isn't finished, Peter. You take away her father as a destination, that doesn't leave much. She knows he's dead. She wrote half a dozen very intimate, very personal letters to him... yet she stayed in the car watching the violence that she's seen all her life. Were any of the letters written after his death? Yes, but the language was present tense. Almost a confession... or an oral history to him... or-- what is it, Frank? I need Maddie Haskel's medical records. I think I know what she's after. I think I know who Angel is. Anything yet? No. No sign of that pickup on the wire. They're long gone. Peter. What do you have? Maddie Haskel gave birth to a baby boy... in St. Mary's Hospital in Joplin one year ago. The father unspecified. What happened to this baby? Can we access Gilroy's bank records from here? Yeah. Just need a phone line. Go faster. What are you gonna say to him when you see him? I don't know. Gilroy maintained a fairly erratic bank balance over the last couple years. Ten months ago a wire transfer of $7,000 was made... into an account in Gilroy's name. That's two months after Maddie's baby was born. Gilroy took Maddie's child and sold it... and bought himself a TV. It's sick, but it's a motive. That explains why "Angel" was scratched into the television screen. He sold a baby, so he could buy a TV? He wanted something... and we live in a world where children have become another form of currency. That explains why she was in that car. Who transferred the funds to Gilroy's account? It's from the account of a Rudolph Barnard. Lawyer. Lives in Little Rock. So Gilroy takes Maddie's baby, and he has this lawyer, Barnard, broker a deal to sell it. They're still after the same goal... and anyone left that gets in their way is gonna die. I'll call Little Rock P.D. and have them put Barnard into protective custody. Run a check on Barnard's bank records from the same time period. Hopefully there would have been a transfer made by the adopting family. We might be able to get to them before Bobby does. All for the love of her child. Look at this place. It's beautiful. Angel must love livin' here. Maddie, your boy's just one year old. He don't know. Now, let's just go in there, get him and get out of here. Now, don't forget the flowers. He must love it here. - Have the Travises been called? - Line's dead. But Little Rock P.D. is responding now. Yes? Flowers for Mrs. Adeline Travis. Get back! - We don't have anything. - I'm sorry, mister, but you do. You got Maddie's boy. - Who was it, wade? - Lock the door! Stay up there! You better get your ass down here, Adeline. Who are you? You come down here now! Come on! - Oh, my God. - Come on! Come on, now! Give her the kid. No. Why? - Because he's hers. You stole him. - No! - We adopted him. - Don't lie to me! - It was legal! we have the papers! - Give her the damn boy now! Oh, God! Oh, God- - Shh. Hi, Angel. Shh. Momma's right here. - That's right. Shh. - Come on, Maddie. Let's go. - Please. - Have you been a good boy, baby? - Come on, Maddie. - Aw, look at how big you got. And you have your granddaddy's big eyes. Don't take him- Maddie. Now. Oh, thank you. - What the hell are you doin'? - It's okay. Angel belongs here, Bobby. Not after all this, he doesn't! Come on. Let's just go. Bobby, no! This is the Little Rock Police Department. I got it! See what you done? You see what you done? They won't shoot if I walk out holding a baby. Give me the kid. Give me the kid. Give me- Shots fired! Shots fired! Unit 9, you are code 10 until further. Check with dispatch- Hold! Hold. It's over, Maddie. That's Angel? Yeah. Bye-bye, my baby. I haven't seen my boy since that day. The Travises send me a picture once in a while. I asked them not to tell Angel anything about his mother. I don't want him knowin' anything about me. I mean, I doubt if-- if anybody can love him like I do... but I had a feelin' that day that... a life with me... wasn't a price my baby should pay. He'd have just grown up to be another-- another Bobby or anotherJim... another man like my father. I want a clean life for him. At least I had a hand in giving' him that. You saved me that day. Only man in my life that ever did somethin' nice for me. You need anything, Maddie? No. I appreciate your visiting' me. If you get the time, come back if you can. - Bring your daughter. I'd love to meet her. - I will. You're gonna be all right. Time's up. I spend my time thinkin' of Angel... prayin' he ain't thinkin' of me. I made this! (woman) Sometimes I feel time slip like a heartbeat, dear Angel. I wonder if you feel it too across the distance. To have known you for so brief a time, to live with the possibility that we shall never meet again. (man) Killean Marie Haakel'a paaaing ia a leaaon to ua all.

(Maddie) lfyou are indeed lost to me, it is my Lord's prayer that you are not lost to Him, dear Angel. That you walk in the light, that you forgive, and that you never have to know the truth.

The houae la ahaking. There'a a wild animal in the houae. Mommy? Are you for her. Little things like that. She'd work all day, he'd... This man loved her purely. The man that she was in love with kept breaking her heart. One night she got tired and said, "I ain't gonna deal with that no more." And her and that man spent some time, they had a beautiful night. She fell in love with him. Seven years he chased her. And he died the next year. Wasted all of that time. Do you understand how people come to steal things from you? Wasted all of that time being hooked up with some fool and missed the best man in her life. To this day, she'll tell you, "That was the best man in my life." - Do you understand? - Wow. Yes, that's sad. Yeah, but it's all right, honey. That's why you got to wait on God. See, you gotta give up them lists and all of that stuff. I notice in Think Like A Man they say, "Make your list," but I don't believe you oughta have a list, you understand? You gotta get to a point where you just say, you know what? Let me explain something to you. Whatever you've got for me, God, I'm gonna take it. 'Cause sometime love don't come the way you want it to come. - You hear me? - Yeah, I hear you. Sometime love have a hole in the top of the afro. Sometime, love don't have a six-pack, it have a done-lap. A done-lap? Yeah, the belly done lapped over the belt. - Wow. - You gotta get it the way it come. - You understand? - I hear you. I hear you. Let me talk to you about this universe thing. 'Cause I just started hearing about this universe stuff about 20 years ago, before that I ain't never heard nothing about this universe. This thing is scaring me 'cause people take the Bible and they mix it up with a little this and a little that, and they mix up this and they mix up that. Before you know it, you all confused. They've got Christians walking around, talking about the universe all mixed up with all this stuff. Don't even know that they're on a whole other path. Don't even know that you're off base with what the Bible say, because you're over there talking about the universe and all this other stuff. 'Cause I don't understand. I ain't reading nowhere where the universe was nailed to a cross. And I don't know why you would sit around worshipping the universe, when you can worship the creator of the universe. Do you hear me? That's all I'm saying to you, honey. - I understand. - You hear me? Go back to what you know. Go back to what worked for your mama, and your grandmama, and great-granddad, grandpa. That was Jesus. They was up all night calling on the name of Jesus, walking the floor, praying for you, laying hands on you in the middle of the night. When you got sick, they was calling on Jesus. They had the prayer meetings in the house. There ain't nothing wrong with that name, it still works. He ain't gotten away from us, we getting away from him. Do you hear what I'm telling you? Yes, ma'am. You got to get rid of that, honey. You got to go back to church. You got to go back to what you know. You got to go back to your roots. Go back to church. I ain't going, but you go right on up in there and have yourself a good time. Now, wait a minute. Now, you just said all of that about me going to church and you won't go? No, not till they get a smoking section and a bar up in there. I'm not going. - In the church? - Yes. You all have a communion, I'm having Patron. What's up. I don't think that's gonna happen. I don't think I'm going. - You hear what I'm telling you? - I do hear what you're saying. You've given me a lot to think about and I'm gonna pray about it. You gonna pray about it to who? - To Jesus. - Praise God. Hallelujah. - Wow. - You got to do something nice for people, that's why I came here up here to talk to you. - Thank you so much. - You so welcome. You gotta do something nice. Now do something nice. Go on, sign the papers so I can get on out of here. - Just a little while longer. - You're so by the book. Lord. - But thank you, though. - You're very welcome, honey. I hurt my head. I walked into the wall. Can you feel that? There's air on your head. See, now go on up in there and shut her down, son. Walk up in there. You tell this woman... I've already tilled the soil for you, she ready. - All right. - All you gotta do is walk up in there and say, "Look here, baby. We going out." You can do it. You can do it. Ms. Carla. I came here this evening to ask you if you would allow me to take you out for an evening of pleasure. So that I might treat you exactly the way that a woman should be treated. Now, what do you say? I don't know what to say. Ms. Carla... Why are you settling to be all alone When I'm right here waiting for you Tell me why you keep pushing me away When I'm right here for you Lady, just run, run to me I'll take care of you Lady, run, run to me I'm right here for you, girl Now I know you probably don't believe in love sometimes You've got a right to think that love is blind But all I ask is that you open your heart to me Take a chance on me I'm begging you, begging you Begging you, please Run, run to me I'll take care of you, baby, baby I'm down on my knees Begging you, please 59991719 you, begging you, begging you 59991719 you, please Let me, let me take care of you Once You ain't gotta worry about nothing baby, baby, baby, baby Now, Ms. Carla, will you allow me... Yes. Yes. I would like that very much. All right. Very good. God, you work fast. The wedding was beautiful, Mom. I wish you could've been there. I miss you, Mom. Did you come to take me home? You're talking today. Yes, did you come to take me home? No, Mama, you gotta stay here. I can't take care of you. With my job, and the kids and... And Frank is off in Afghanistan. I can't. I want to go home. I know, but this is your home now. I don't like it here. I know, but this is the best that I could do. Fine. The water is on. No, Mama, please don't go. Please stay with me. Stay with me. How are you? I'm fine. It just gets chilly here at night. I'll be sure they bring you more blankets then, okay? Thank you, nurse. Mom, I'm Sue Ellen. Who? Mom, I'm Sue Ellen, you know me. Please remember me. Look at me. You know me. Where are your brothers? They're busy, Mama. Well, fine then. I won't play with you or your toys anymore, Carol. Mom, Carol is your sister. That figures. I love you. Do you hear me? Are we in Hawaii at the beach house? No, Mama. I hear her talking. She talks sometimes, but she doesn't know who I am or that I'm here. This is so hard. I need her in my life. I just want to talk with her and I want her to talk to me. Why? Because I love her. This old selfish woman? She wasn't selfish. She had to be selfish. No, she wasn't selfish at all. You mean, this woman would give of herself to other people? Yes, all the time. Well, y'all must not have had no good memories at all, not one. Yes, we did. We had great memories. - And she was a good woman? - Yes. When she was in her right mind, she was a good woman, she wasn't selfish and all of that stuff? Yes. I thought she was selfish as hell. Why? 'Cause of you. - Me? - Yeah. 'Cause you sit here 10, 12 hours a day. Only a selfish person would want you sitting here all this time like this, honey. - You understand what I'm trying to tell you? - Yeah. This woman, hear me good when I say this, if this were me, I would not want my daughter sitting here all this time. You got children to raise. You got a whole life to live. And anybody who loved you would not want you doing this to yourself. I know, but it's hard. I understand that, but you know what's unfair? For you to reduce her life to this moment. You're looking at the end, honey. You gotta remember the whole total life. You gotta remember all the joy and all the peace. You gotta give each one of them the same amount of energy, you understand? You can't just reduce it to this moment. This woman, if she wasn't selfish, she wouldn't want that. I know I wouldn't want Cora to sit here. First of all, Cora ain't gonna sit here all this time like this. Unless there's a snack machine up under that bed, Cora ain't gonna do that. It's good to see you smile, honey. - Thank you. - But you gotta learn how to start to let go. How do I let go? Well, you've already started, and I'll tell you how. You put her in a nice place where people can take care, and they take good care of her here. I've watched them, you understand? But you gotta learn how to start to let go. Little by little, that's how you do it. Bit by bit. Instead of staying 10 hours one day, maybe you'll come and you'll stay nine. Then you might relapse and come 12. See, you go back and forth when you're going through this kind of stuff. You just have to go with it. But you got children to raise and a life to live. And I'm sure this woman would not want this, honey. Let go bit by bit. Maybe one day you'll skip a whole day. Then you'll find it easier to do. You hear me? I hear you. Well, it's good she's loved. A lot of folk don't have people to love them at this part in their life. So it's good that she's loved and good you're here for her. That don't mean that you don't love her, 'cause you ain't here. - You hear me? - I hear you. Forgive yourself, honey. You keep talking about, "I want this. I want... I... That's about you, that ain't about her. - You understand? - I understand. Okay. All right, hon. - Madea? - Yes. Will you please say a prayer before you go? Girl, you ain't seen none of my DVDs, have you? Okay, I got to get out of here. Time for me to go. Okay. - Y'all going out? - Yes, ma'am. - Okay, good. Enjoy yourselves. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - And thank you, and feel free to volunteer anytime. And feel free to hear me saying, "Hell, no." I'll teach you how to get that note. Where's he at? Hey, son. Man, you think I'm playing with you? Look, I told you not to call my job again. - I didn't call your job. - Yeah, you did. Does my job look like a joke to you? I got a family to take care of that I refuse to neglect, like you did to me and my mama. - Son, I didn't call your job. - Yes, you did. - No, I didn't. - My boss said that you called and asked me to bring you some... - Cereal. - What? Hattie? You ain't asleep. You call that boy's job and asked for cereal? So what? He got money. What did you say when you called him? Bring home a box of cereal, please. Hey, son. Son! Son... Let me ask you something, did you know what was going on with this man and your mama? No, ma'am. I just know he wasn't there. Wasn't there for you. Is this what you want? - You stand up. This what you want? - No. - Is this what you want? - No, ma'am. This boy need to be with his baby. You having trouble with that woman, that won't even talk to her, but you and that baby mama are adults. Act like y'all got some damn sense. Call each other and have a conversation so that this man can spend time with his child. Every man need to be with their child. Do you understand? That ain't got nothing to do with... You don't want that child growing up 'cause you can't be adult enough to let him spend some time with his daddy. You don't want him growing up with that on his mind, thinking his daddy didn't want him 'cause of you. Do you understand? It's unfair for him to have to make a choice between you and his child. That's all I'm going to say to you. That's all I got to say about that. Now, you. - This man wasn't there for you? - No. - Never? - Never. - Your mama raised you? - Yes, she did. - How's your life? - My life is great. - Got a good job? - I have a great job. Got a great job. You married? Yes, ma'am, I am, and I have a son. - Yeah? You're a good father? - I'm a great father. - Good husband? - I'm a great husband. - So your mama was good to you? - She was great. - Took you to church? - Yes, ma'am. - You're saved? - Yes, I am. Why are you mad? That's what I wanna know. You can see there's a little scripture in the Bible say, "All things work together for the good of them that love "the Lord and are called according to his purpose." You know what that mean? Everything that you been through will work together for your good. Everything, if you let it. Everything will work together for your good. If you call and love the Lord. Do you hear what I'm telling? Do you hear what I'm saying to you, son? Everything. You ever thought maybe this man wasn't supposed to be there? If he had been in your life, you might have turned out to be somebody else. But because he wasn't, look how you turned out. God had you covered, son. This is what I want you to understand. Ain't no sense in you sitting around here being mad. This man taught you everything you needed to know. You know how he taught you? In reverse. You do the opposite of what he did and you have your answers. Do you hear what the hell I'm saying? And you should have been there, you should have been there. See, a lot of times you go out there. You doing all that whoring around and playing around doing this and doing that and then you grow up and you get old. And you're wondering why you there by yourself. 'Cause you weren't there for your child. Now you got one foot in the grave and you're trying to make some peace. And it's up to him whether he want to give you the peace or not, but, son, let me tell you something. If you want to get even with this man, be nice to him. I'm telling you, if you really want to mess somebody up that done did you wrong, be nice to them, show them some kindness. They don't know how to handle it. It's like putting hot coals on their head. They can't sleep at night. Do you hear me? It's going to be all right, son. Talk to this man. 'Cause you'll be a fool if you don't. You spend some time with him. He might have something he can share with you. Don't give him no money, but he might have something he can share with you. You hear me? Something that he can share with you that will help you in the future. Your child might end up getting older and in need of some kind of surgery or something and you ain't even talked to this man. He got the answer 'cause something going on with his father and father before him. And he can tell you about it 'cause it's something he might know. Hear me? You owe it to yourself to at least have the conversation with the man. Now go on up there and talk to him. It ain't gonna kill you to talk to him. When you get up there, you know what I want you to tell him? The first thing you say to him, you say, "Daddy, you gonna take this toupee off your head right now." Well, I'm getting ready to get on up out of here. It's been a pleasure. I'll see y'all later on. - Thank you. - You're very welcome. Thank you so much. Hey, Hattie, where you going? Where you going? I'm going with you. I knew that. I knew you gonna try that, Hattie, but let me tell you something. I saw when you put your bag in my car and I took it back out the car. And I brought it up there, put it under your chifforobe, behind the pillow and put your Froot Loops right back up under the bed which you been trying to hide. Everything is back in your room. All your little socks, all your little underwear, it's all back up there. So now you can't go with me. Yeah, I saw when you did that, so I brought it back down, I got my socks and everything, put it back in the bag, took it back outside and put it in the car. Now, let's ride. All right. No, no. Go ahead. Go on. Start the car for me. I'm coming. I'm gonna say goodbye. These people have been so nice. - Start the car? - Start the car. All right. Deuces. Look here. I parked in the back. I'll see you all later. Madam.! Madam.! Madea. Madea. Hattie? Madea. Madea left me. That's all right. She'll be back. She's gonna need me for one of her drive-bys. She'll be back. And I'll be right here waiting on her. That's all right. That's all right. She'll be back. I'm right here. Come get me. Say something. Say anything... - Mama.

I really did. He was singing his heart out in Craig Lewis Band. Zuri is in the back. They are amazing singers. I am beyond blessed. I get to share the stage with these people every night. These are some of the most amazing singers in the world. On July 8th of 2012, next month, it'll be 20 years that I've been doing these shows. Twenty years. Started right down the street at the 14th Street Playhouse. Thought I'd see 1,200 people and 30 showed up. Lost everything I had, but I had a dream. And I had hope and I kept pushing and kept fighting. I had a million people tell me, "No." But I got one "Yes" from God. And I don't care how many dreamers are in this room, I don't care how many people have tried to stop you, I don't care how many people have told you, "it's not gonna work." I'm a living witness that it does work. God is good. In my life, all I want to do, the end of the song talks about it's all about love. It really, truly ls all about love. Because all I want to do is lift us up, encourage us, make us laugh, make us think and at the same time believe with some joy and some faith and some hope. My mother, God rest her soul. I had one dream when I started doing these shows and that was just to be able to do well enough to take care of her. And because of people like you all over this country, I was able to do that, and around the world. So, God bless you. I will never forget it. And my prayer for you, is that everything you've done for me, may it come back to you 100 fold. I am grateful to my mother every day. She didn't have a whole lotto leave me, but she taught me about Jesus. And there are a lot of people in Hollywood who believe a lot of things. Listen, God bless them. Let them believe... Listen, I don't talk about what you believe. I respect everybody, what they believe. All I ask is that you respect me in what I believe, and I believe in Jesus Christ. I don't make any apologies for it. It doesn't make me perfect, it makes me redeemed. And what I try to do with everything is just give us all a little bit of hope, a little bit of lifting. So, whatever you're going through in your life, if this show has spoken to you or anything that I've done, I want you to know that it's all been by design just for you. All the dreamers in this room, go back and dust your dream off if you've stopped. Don't let anybody stop you. Pm telling you, if I would have given up, I wouldn't be sitting here and you wouldn't be sitting there. It's easy to give up. It's easy to let go, 'cause it hurts too much to dream. Sometimes dreams can be tough to keep going. And sometimes all you have is yourself to encourage yourself. You have to rely on and remember everything that I did. I had to rely and remember everything that my mother taught me, everything the Bible taught me about making it and going forth and God being with me and having the faith the size of a mustard seed. And as I did that, I Watched my whole life change. But there was a simple prayer that she taught me that I never forgot. It's a simple prayer, a lot of people say it, but they don't really mean it. It's a simple prayer, it says, "God, let your will be done." If you can say that and really mean it, your entire fife will change. Because it means that you give up control. It means that you give up trying to make everything go your way. You let God be the wind in your sail, and take you to the place where He wants you to go. So what I would tell you tonight, if you're going through anything, worried about your children, family, job, whatever, just stressing out, just let it be. Let it be. Do all you can, then stand. And let it be. God has the answer, so let it be. God bless you, Atlanta. I love you so much. I'll see you really soon. This is my fourth Tyler Perry play that I'm here to see. And this is Madea Gets a Job and it is crazy funny. You got to see it. - We're having a blast at this place. - Yes. Madea got a job and the job is a hot mess. This is my first time ever coming to anything like this, and it's been a lot of fun. I've never had a chance to see him live like this. And I'm really grateful to God for allowing me to have this experience. We've been Tyler Perry fans forever, since it all began, way back when. Since the beginning. We thank you for bringing the show to Atlanta. We're just having an awesome time. This is my first Tyler Perry play ever. This is my first time coming to the Tyler Perry show. I had a great time with my mom. I'm all the way from London. This is the first time I've got to see a Tyler Perry show, production show. Totally excited. He needs to bring it over to London, I'm sure many people would want to see it. I'm the biggest fan. I have every single last DVD. And of course, I'm getting this one, too. Uncut. Uncensored. So that's great. He's hilarious. We drove all the way over here from South Haven, Michigan to see him. And I think the best part for me was when she told Allen it looked like he combed his beard up to cover up the bald spot on his head. I've been a Tyler Perry fan for six years now. I drove all the way from Knoxville, Tennessee, just to come see it here in Atlanta. This is my fourth play, actually, and I cannot wait to see more. I'm so excited. And it's been funny so far. You think that old lady funny? - I think she is hilarious. - She's crazy. - It was very funny, it was very exciting... Motivational. We should really come back. - We really should. - Yeah. - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow. Tyler Perry had me in stitches. I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. His messages are so inspirational. I done cried and laughed, all at the same time, already. Love it. It's really uplifting, it was inspirational. Keep on doing what you're doing, brother. Because a lot of people in this world really need a little fix. I had to bring her. I've been to every Tyler Perry show. This was one of the best ones. The concept was awesome, everything was the bomb. I love Tyler Perry. He rocks! - The singing... - Great. I love all the singers. They sound really good. Yeah, singers, that was... - Yes. - I can hit those notes, too. - Tyler can sing. - I know. He can not only sing, he can sing. I think I saw a little Harlem shaking going on in that singing just now. Thank you, Mr. Perry. Tyler Perry, once again, you have showed up and showed out all this... - Yes, great one. Great job! - Great job! Awesome, phenomenal job, man. Keep it going, brother. - We love you, Tyler Perry. - Love you. - Awesome. Tyler Perry, we love you. - Awesome. Tyler Perry, we love you. Thank you, praise God. We enjoyed it, it was so much fun. Great job, Tyler. Hey, Tyler, we love you! - I love you, Tyler! - Love you! Climate changes and population growth are threatening the natural equilibrium of our planet. Nowhere is the challenge greater than in Africa where the population is projected to grow from one to two billion within a few decades. More land is needed each year to provide for this rapid growth and vast areas of African wilderness are vanishing at an alarming pace. In years to come, what remains of the untouched wilderness on this vast continent could shrink to a few pockets of fenced in game reserves that will be little more than large outdoor zoos. Before it is too late, we want you, to join us on a safari adventure across the continent to survey what remains of the real African wilderness. Look who's join us. Welcome, it's good to have you on board, I am Mara Douglas-Hamilton... and I am Kevin Richardson. Welcome to Namibia. We're going to take you on an incredible journey across Africa all the way to Kilimanjaro. And remember there is just one rule, please keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle at all times... Oh yeah, remember to have some fun. Let's. I am really excited to share this incredible experience with Mara. Born in a family of prominent conservationists in Kenya, she was raised among wild elephants. Inspired by her close connection to nature, she has explored the remotest corners of the continent and is active in the fight to protect African elephants. As a child born in the suburbs of Johannesburg, Kevin who always had a keen interest in animals was not pre-destined to become a world renowned wildlife expert. But at the age of 23, a chance encounter with the owner of a Lion Park in South Africa ignited his passion for big cats. With a lot of hard work and an amazing gift, he managed to be accepted by a large pride of lion as one of their own. To achieve this amazing feat, Kevin broke safety rules in the book. Joining us on the expedition are location manager, Marc Baar, field engineer, Hal Bowker and balloonist, Dany Cleyet Marrel. Dany has customized a balloon, called the Cinebulle, especially for this adventure. Instead of a heavy basket, the passenger sits on a lightweight aluminum bench, increasing the balloon's flying range dramatically. The propeller at the back gives us the ability to steer instead of merely drifting along with the wind current. As we take off on our maiden flight, it is reassuring to know that Dany is one of the world's leading ballooning expert. He has lead countless... scientific hot air balloon expeditions on all continents and is the inventor of a wide range of flying devices used in the famous canopy raft missions. We will count on Dany to get access to some remote parts of the African Wilderness. The only draw back of the Cinebulle is that it can only take one passenger. So Kevin and I will have to take turns, but today the pleasure is all mine. My hair got all messed up! A short distance from the dunes, we drive east through some of the oldest canyons on earth, the gateway to one of last safe havens for the elusive black rhino. Numbering in the hundreds of thousands a century ago, illegal poaching caused their population to dwindle to less than 2500. Thanks to aggressive protection programs in countries like Namibia, the species recovered somewhat over the last decade to over 5000. But poaching is on the rise again. Around 120 black rhinos were killed last year alone. Thought to have healing powers, rhino horn is in fact mere keratin, the same substance as our fingernail. This protein has zero medicinal value, yet it is pushing a magnificent species to the brink of extinction. A number of private game reserves in Africa have been restocked with rhinos. But to see them in the wild would be a real treat. Extremely skittish and fearful of poachers, black rhinos spend most of their time hidden in thick bush. There is no guarantee we will meet this pre-historic animal. I think just up ahead here is where the road forks. - Yeah, looks like it. - Did you see the Jackal! - No. - Over there! I think this is where we turn. Right about here. Yeah. The river is on the right, we head to the higher plateau on the left. Hi, hi, Captain! I'm glad you know who is in charge here... Oh, give me a break, Mara! In order to fight the renewed poaching activity, Namibia has made vast areas of rhino habitat inaccessible to the public. On the express condition that we do not reveal our actual location, we've received special permission to penetrate deep into a rhino sanctuary accompanied by heavily armed anti-poaching rangers. Over there in the hills. - Is that where the hide is? - Yes. OK. Bye guys. Good luck. OK, thanks and you too, cheers. As Mara goes to her hide with Bazil, I am taken to an even more secret place, a water hole next to a very remote research station. A nearby radio tower used by the scientists could be spotted on Google Earth enabling poachers to find the location, so we have been asked not to show any pictures of the surrounding area. So Bazil, how many Rhinos are we going to see? 20, maybe more. I wish. I can't believe it, we've been here less than an hour and already our first sighting. That's Eliza, she has the longest horn on record of any white rhino in Africa. You know her by name? Yes, we see her quite often, she's been around this area for years. So we gave her a name. This is such a great place to view rhinos. Unlike white rhinos, black rhinos are reclusive solitary animals, seldom seen during the day. But they do need to drink daily, so they usually head for the waterholes after sunset. Using infra red lights and special viewing equipment, I hope to catch a glimpse of the elusive mammals. Let's see if Kevin or I will have better luck... See, a jackal! He seems really nervous. He must have heard something. Hey, look at that, a leopard. That's very unusual, we seldom see them around here. Did you hear that? I think there are some rhinos approaching. A jackal, a leopard, a white rhino, all in a few minutes. There are more coming. This place is amazing, it's incredible. I wonder how Mara is doing? Still nothing. I know, but sitting and waiting for rhinos is a patience game. Look to the left Kevin, two more Rhinos. What a night... You are really lucky, look at their mouths. These are black rhinos. These majestic animal. I can't believe poachers would shoot them just for their horns... But not if we shoot them first! That's one way to look at it. They are very skittish, look at their ears. They know we are here, that's for sure. Mara to the right... Oh look, how wonderful. A mother and her calf. We must be very quiet. See how nervous they are. Oh no, they are leaving already. What was that? Something flashing over there. It's an infra red camera trap. That's how the researchers keep track of the animals around here. Oh look here is another male who's approaching. This is very unique to see so many rhinos in one place. You are very fortunate, sometimes we don't see any for a week or more. Oh shoot... I hit my lamp against the tablet. It is sad to see how such fearless animal have become so nervous because of poaching. Leaving the Canyon region, we head west to the Waterberg plateau, the home of the Cheetah Conservation research center and one of the largest protected habitats for the fastest predator on earth. Like black rhinos, Cheetahs are on the verge of extinction. About half of the 6000 remaining specimens are found in Namibia. This predator has a large hunting range often spanning over 150 km. The abundant wildlife and low population density make Namibia an ideal sanctuary for this majestic cat. Contrary to lion and leopard who from time to time may be a threat to humans, cheetah represent no danger to people, but they do kill domestic animals and are considered vermin by the local farmers. In Southern Africa, photo safaris often take place in fenced-in games reserves that have been re-stocked with wild animals. It is not unusual to see the big five in a single day. But it can take a lot of driving and patience to find what you are looking for in the real African wilderness. And this is certainly true for cheetah. The plains at the foot of the Waterberg plateau, teaming with antelope are the ideal hunting ground for cheetah. But the tall grass makes it difficult for us to spot them. So we ask Dany to do a quick survey of the area from the air before sunset. It is Kevin's turn to fly. Mara, Mara do you copy! - Loud and clear! - Okay. Soon after take off, the wind comes up unexpectedly, pushing the balloon towards the acacia forest bordering the plains. A landing in the thorny trees would spell disaster and shred the balloon to pieces. We have to brace for a rough landing. Hey Kevin, what's happening! Are you landing? We've got a little bit of a situation. Wind Shift, we are being push towards the acacia trees. We're gonna go down... It's an emergency. We're going too fast! It's going to be rough. Kevin, you're not hurt? No, I'm OK. I am fine! Thanks, I am fine. What a wind shift, I didn't see it coming... Yes. The next morning, with the help of the Cheetah Conservation Fund researchers who monitor cheetah activity with infra red camera traps, we head for an area where several predators have been spotted earlier in the day. This is a really exciting opportunity for me. I have done a lot of work with lions and hyenas, but I never had a chance to observe cheetahs at such close range in the wild before. This could be the day. Look over there... a cheetah. What is he chasing? Well, I don't see anything. Still running. Maybe he is chasing us. Yeah, could be. I am just going to give him some space... He seems a bit aground. I'll give him a bit of a wide berth. That must be the tree. Yeah, I am just gonna get in a bit closer. Look at that, our timing is perfect. It is the first time in my life I've seen a cheetah in a tree. Yeah, it's unusual. Look, cubs in the grass. I didn't even see them there. I was too busy looking up. Contrary to leopards who spend most of their days in trees, cheetah only use them briefly as vantage point to scan the plains for potential prey. The oryx she spotted are certainly too big for a lone cheetah but a coalition of two or three of them could probably take such a big antelope down. Most predators do quite well in national parks and private game reserves, as there are plenty of prey for them to hunt. But Cheetahs have a much tougher time competing with the bigger cats like lion or leopard. The fences around the parks reduce their hunting range drastically and they often become prey themselves. To survive they need vast protected areas like this one. The sighting left us speechless. In just a few days, we've had multiple encounters with two of the most endangered animals on the continent. What an auspicious start to our journey across Africa. But the day wasn't over yet. As we are driving away, I catch a glimpse of a wonderful sight in my rear view mirror. Considering the loss of habitat due to population explosion in Africa and the hunting by local farmers, man is unquestionably the cheetah's biggest threat. But ironically, without man's intervention the species won't make it on its own. The most graceful cat on our planet is literally racing for its survival. Leaving Namibia for the Okavango Delta in Botswana, we cross the northern part of the Kalahari desert, the home of some the biggest and most powerful lions in Africa. As we are looking for a campsite along the northern border of the reserve, we come across a coalition of three big male lions. A worrisome sight so close to local villages. Lions normally do not hunt on farmland, but the loss of their habitat force them occasionally to raid villages for domestic animals. This resulting conflict is the main cause for the rapid decline of the number of lions in the wild. Having lost about 80% of their habitat, it is estimated that fewer than 25000 lions still roam free. Look, the three lions we saw yesterday evening. Can you see what they killed? No, I'm not sure... it's definitely not a cow. It looks like a buffalo, but there's none around here. Oh no, I can't believe it... It's a horse. If the villagers find out about it, these lions are definitely history. Yeah still eating. One on the carcass, and then there is another in the back. They've eaten quite a lot, you can smell it from here. Yeah, but the good thing is they're not gonna leave their kill until it's all gone. I mean this leaves us a day or two to observe them at close range. They seemed pretty relaxed, but they are really exposed out here. We could be angry villagers. Yeah, but I think they know we're OK. I mean we followed them around for awhile yesterday afternoon, and then into the whole of last night. Where is the third lion? I think he probably went for a drink. You know that's all they do really, eat, drink and then rest. Now what are these fellows up to? It's a bit weird, I mean they should not be marking their territory. You see the second lion. That may keep other lions away. But it's people they have to watch out for. That's for sure, but it's amazing how comfortable they are with us. We've only been with them in a few hours. They must have heard something, they are on full alert! No... False alarm. This is what lions really like to do. Snooze lazily in the shade of a bush. Yeah but when you look at them, you think they are completely oblivious to their surroundings, but they're actually not. Looks like they're heading back to the carcass. Known as the river that never finds the sea, the Okavango spills billions of liters of water daily in the Kalahari desert, creating one of the most pristine... untouched wildlife refuges in the world. Most of the delta is totally inaccessible by car, so the best way to appreciate this piece of Eden is from the air. The trick for Dany will be to find a place to land, but we'll worry about that later. The biggest threat to the Okavango does not come from the encroachment of the local population, but rather from Botswana's neighbors to the north: Namibia and Angola where the river has its source. The population of Angola has doubled since 1990. The pressure to extract water for agriculture irrigation and to build hydro-electrical dams might just prove impossible to withstand in years to come. Such human interference with the seasonal cycles of the delta would have catastrophic consequences for this unique ecosystem. The Okavango is the largest inland delta on earth, but it is very shallow in most parts. A significant change in the natural water flow would set in motion a domino effect that would be hard to stop. Large parts of the delta would dry up and most of the wildlife would vanish. The upper part of the delta known as the panhandle is a shallow valley. 15 km wide, it is flooded with one to ten meters of water depending on the time of the year. The entire valley is covered with a thick layer of papyrus floating on top of the waterbed. In the deepest part of the valley where the current is the strongest, the water flow opens up wide channels that meander downstream like giant snakes. Further south, the delta fans out like a hand spreading its fingers. Small islands pop up everywhere, offering a sanctuary to a great variety of big game animals. On our way to recover the balloon on a remote island with the help of the local crew, we have two very close encounters with elephants. Elephants in the delta are a sight to behold. If you happen to cross their path, a face-to-face encounter always leaves a big impression. Although the Chobe river is less than 300 km from the Okavango, there are no roads crossing the delta, so we have to drive around the Southern part of the flood plains. It will take us two days to get there. In the 1960's, the government of Botswana embarked on an ambitious project to protect the country's wilderness. Ironically, the program has been so successful that the authorities now have to cope with increasing elephant numbers. Their population has increased from 40,000 in the 1980s to 130,000 today. The large herds that concentrate along the river have destroyed most of the trees in the area and human-elephant conflict is on the rise. There is no easy solution to this problem. The Botswana government is against culling and translocating mass numbers of elephants to other parts of Africa where their numbers are dwindling. It is expensive and impractical. If nature is left to take its course, a severe drought could wipe out thousands of elephants with starvation. But the future of the elephant is in the balance. With heavy poaching for ivory in the rest of Africa, I believe it is only a matter of time before this population too is affected. It's getting late, we should look for a place to camp. Not too close to the water though, there are huge crocodiles in the Chobe. Let's check out the sunset first. Yeah, look at that. A picture perfect scene, with elephants in the foreground. Stunning man, stunning. The next day, we drive along the bank of the Chobe, hoping to observe large herds of elephants. I have been around wild elephants since I was a child, but this is my first visit to Chobe. It is not unusual here to see scores of elephant families numbering in the hundreds gather along the river. These impalas are unusually relaxed. Yeah, in most places they just bolt off in front of an approaching vehicle. It is a bit early in the day for the elephants to come to the river, but there is always something to see along the Chobe. Over there, hippos... What are they doing out of the water at this time of the day? - Oh Kevin, look what's coming. - What? In the distance... fantastic! Beautiful, what a scene! What a sighting. The two largest African mammals are rarely seen together. Hippos mostly venture out of the water at night. During the day, they chill out in the river and are seldom seen on the bank. Elephants on the other hand, mostly head to the river in the afternoon to escape the heat of the day. This is such a fun scene. In a few minutes we witness the entire ritual of the elephants' daily trip to the river, drinking, mud splashing, dusting and socializing! It's back to the water for that battle scarred old male. It looks like the beach is getting too crowded for him. A one-month-old baby in the hole. I am wondering if he is going to make it out on his own. Later in the day, we got exactly what we were looking for. A close encounter with a large herd of elephants... very exciting and at the same time, quite intimidating. That mother with her calf is not too sure about us. Yeah, I don't think she is happy with us blocking her path. I think she's OK. She really does not look aggressive. We should stay absolutely quiet and I think she'll move. The next morning, we hooked up with Ishmail, a local guide who took us on game viewing expedition on the river, a great opportunity to observe the wildlife from a unique vantage point. It's amazing how calm they are. They let us come very close. Yeah, maybe a bit too close... That female is not happy. She's giving us a warning sign. Ishmail, I think we should get out of here. In the wild, there is always a thin line between an exciting game viewing experience and a dangerous encounter. Ishmail knows that better than anyone as he paddles slowly to a safe distance. Minutes later, we become privy to another exciting scene as the herd decided to swim across the river to feed on a patch of tall grass with your fingers in your ears! Wired trigger. Bryant Marlow's gun. I should've known that. My own brother Bryant he's been a cloud on me everywhere I tried to go. Looks like an honest man hasn't got a chance. I tried to hold him for you, marshal but he led Cullen wrong and got him killed. You done right marshal. You only followed duty. I'll help Dallas to set the noose around him. I'll give a reward for his capture. I'll pay my tithes to set this county free. - Marshal. - Quiet. Don't let them know I'm shot. Get the horses. Gotta get out of town without advertising it. Should've taken you straight to a doctor. That's how you lost Bull Run, Yankee: Letting the enemy know your casualty. He's right. It's best the Marlows detect no weaknesses. Don't worry. We are good doctors here. We had to be. What a brave one. The valiente who was to remove the Marlows. You had your chance at Will. Why didn't you shoot first and ask questions afterwards? - Or is it that you're afraid? - Luis. - Go from this room. - Let the little scorpion stay. He's right. I was afraid. Afraid I'd die and leave Bryant Marlow alive. I can't die, not until he's dead. I'd give much to be able to believe you. - My brother wasn't always like that. - He has a nasty bite. Don't blame him. You'd be bitter, too, if you were in his place. Amelia, the iron. Martin. Let's face it, Tonia Boston was one place but this is another. - Are you sorry you came? - No, I didn't say that. But every day I realize more that I've walked into a world of which I know nothing. - Could go back to your world, Martin. - And admit I'm licked? How long would I keep your love then? I came here to take care of you and I'll do it. Martin. That's for trying. But learning to shoot like Mr. Hickok won't help if you get sunstroke. Here. Duck! Here comes Will. Welcome, brother. You can take over now. I've had me a bellyful of this coyote music and I ain't just a bird cooing. You'll stay here and like it. That marshal's after you so you pull a murder for an introduction. Harper says your gun's evidence enough to hang you. And I had to do plenty fast-talking to keep myself out of your mess. You and your talking. If you'd done it my way, we'd be living in the Robles' hacienda by now. Hacienda, he says. So I wind up living in a dirt-floor parlor. - It's not your first one. - Shut his mouth for him, Bryant. Tell him what you said. Tell him who's gonna be boss. Boss? So that's it. Do you want me to take a trip? What for? I might drop by some Army post. Military always been interested what happened to the Hollisters over in Georgia. You was guiltier than I was. - You're the one... - To cover you, you trigger-crazy... You leave evidence, Bryant. I don't. That's why I could give evidence against you. But you're the only one that could. She can now. Can you handle her? You'd better mind, Will. We don't want no Cains or Abels on our souls. - No Lot's wife either. - Take it easy. - Nobody has to get hurt. - Except that marshal. And I'll take care of him. Last time you tried to take care of things, you lost a gun. Leave him to me. I still got him on the hook for $ 10,000. Town hall, remember? If you know what's good for you, you just keep putting the spurs to old Robles. Martin who is he? He's a wanted criminal. Is that such a blow to you, Tonia? He's our friend. I had to know the truth. I coded a message to the Attorney General. The government says he's carried on guerrilla action but I've got his record. I know who his victims were: Carpetbaggers, men like Will Marlow. I should arrest him, but how can I when I know that if the South had won and men had dug their hobnails into us I'd have been an outcast too. I wish now I'd never laid eyes on him. Why do you say that? I'm a fool. I'm trying to arrange a pardon for him. - Lf I succeed... - Have you told him? Oh, no. Nor can you. Hopes can be brutal, Tonia if they don't materialize. How's things in Dallas? I saw Senora Walters. She will do as you say. And Bryant Marlow? Like you, he stays out of sight. Thanks for the loan of your horse. - Where are you going? - Hunting. - You're not well enough to ride. - I'm fine. You can't arrest Bryant Marlow alone, not with that pack he has around him. Arresting's your idea. Well, I lose my bet. - What bet? - With myself. - Once you started serving your country... - I have no country. - And you call me "foreigner." - You and all blue-belly. We washed your gray and hung it out to dry. Not mine, Yankee. If you wanna try, just send for that Gettysburg brother of yours. He's still at Gettysburg. Well, I guess I'm wearing a good name. Had one of my own once. Small pumpkins maybe, compared to the railroading Weatherbys, but it set well. It meant "cotton." I been talking in my sleep. Soil around here would grow better cotton than ever came out of Georgia. - You ought to put a bug in Felipe's ear. - I've got a bug in my own. I want to get a railroad headed this way. This is a big country, Reb. You said so yourself. Cotton, railroads. Weatherby, Hollister. Dreams, fried up, short order. Must they be dreams? You know what "Texas" means? It's an Indian word for "friend." It's a big land with room for everyone. You could be a part of it, in time. Time? That's for you two love-doves. The space of a lifetime to be together. I've got no time. For me, time's running out. - What's up? - Senor, she says... I wanna talk to Marshal Weatherby. - Well, who are you? - Mrs. Walters, Mrs. Bill Walters. I'm the marshal. What's wrong? That Bryant Marlow, bullying and threatening for his brother Will. He's bringing a bill of sale out tonight, made for me to sign away Bill's leavings. - Where? - At my house, right outside of Dallas. - Well, I'll go with you. - Bless you. - Who was it? - Senora Walters. Senora Walters? Impossible. I just left her in Dallas. - Then who...? - I don't know. Carlos. ...call the vaqueros. Find the marshal and tell him the woman lied. Alberto! Manuel! Higher. Higher. Nice work, Flo. Get down off that horse. Just raring to ride, huh? Yeah, too much "giddap" and not enough "whoa." I knew you weren't Mrs. Walters. Figured I'd gamble on a lead. Remember how you poured it into Cullen? You're rushing me, but I'll try. Just take your time. I never did like to eat my striped candy too quick. Scared? Bumps like an alligator. You shoot, and you will draw them in here. Let them chase an empty saddle. Slippery as a greased hog, ain't you? But it ain't gonna gain you nothing. Pop that gun off, it'll cost you $ 10,000. - What are you talking about? - The town hall. I posted my cashier's check with the bank. Will gets it when he comes in with the deed, if I sign the release. Don't you bite on that. No Marshal Weatherby, no 10,000. And Will will just skin you alive. - Lf you don't plug him, I will. - Let him have it, lummox. Oh, shut up. I'm trying to think what... What Will would do if he was doing the thinking. It's a good gamble, Bryant. My life against a wad of money. I'll just ride out of here nice and easy while you're thinking. Will will call down fire and brimstone on you. What would Will do? Well, what am I worrying about Will for? It's me he's got the evidence on. I'm worth more than $ 10,000 to me! You'd get your pockets picked in a graveyard. Sap-sucking yahoo. He won't get far in this brush on my horse. Reno. Reno, boy. Reno. Gerry, you and Bill circle this thicket here. Rest of you, fan out but don't let him get away. Reno, boy. Reno. Reno. Hey, fellas, Reno throwed him! He's afoot! Come on, root him out! Hey. Hey! Help! Get over here! Think you're smart, don't you? Hey, you fellas, get over here! Hey! Hey, you fellas, get in here. Come on, cut me down. - What happened? - Never mind what happened. Cut me down. Here he comes. Where's Will Marlow now? Matt Coulter's inside doing the honors. You gotta make Will believe you're on his side, remember. Downright perjury. In case... Don't ask me to bear witness against myself. A job like that takes a big-caliber man, Mr. Marlow. Just call me Will. Evening, Matt. Evening, Mr. Marlow. - Evening, judge. - Oh, just call him Will. I was telling Mr. Marlow about our idea. We got to have a go-getter for mayor. Oh, indubitably. In a city such as ours, we'll need lights pavements indoor water closets. Oh, good evening, marshal. Pour yourself some spirits. - Good evening, marshal. - We've been feeling Mr. Marlow out on running for mayor. - Marshal won't think I'm a go-getter. I been working on that deed for you, but Mrs. Walters here... Didn't she tell you? I bought the deed from her. - Evening, Mrs. Walters. - Good evening, marshal. I'm afraid Mr. Marlow won't be available to run for mayor. - Why not? - I aim to have him behind bars. That's a mighty poor joke. I wouldn't advise making irresponsible statements, marshal. He's in cahoots with his brother. One's guilty, so is the other. Somebody's lying. Anybody says I was ever tied up with Bryant, I'll sue for libel. Bryant just got through ambushing me. It ain't possible. He wouldn't dare to go against... He had a.44 halfway down my gullet. - You drilled him. - He shot the guns right off me. I had to talk my way out. He let you...? Praise heaven he saw the light. No man wants his brother to have a killing on his soul. Interesting thing is how I talked my way out. He didn't know I'd bought the Chuckaway any more than you. He thought if he killed me, it'd cost you money. Figured it better to let me walk out than to have you on his neck. Mr. Marlow, this is hard to believe that a citizen like you... - It's Bryant, that renegade. He's always been against me. Hates my law-abiding principle. He's trying to put the blight on me. Will's right. Bryant pulled one on you, marshal. Will's in the clear. Why, you were there. He promised to post a reward for Bryant's capture. I'd hate to hang by my toes till you do. Well, you know, a man hates to put the dead mark on his brother. You hear that? He's making it dead or alive. Now, any man that's big enough for that is big enough for mayor. - Yeah! - Yeah, he's right! You're right, Matt. You're going to eat crow, marshal. I'm authorizing you to announce my reward: Two thousand dollars for Bryant Marlow. - Dead or alive. - I guess I ought to be man enough to say I'm wrong, Mr. Marlow. Thank you, marshal. Thank you, gentlemen, one and all. Good night, Matt. He's gonna make a good mayor. I wish it was Saturday night so I could take a bath. Hey, Bryant. - What? - Here's Reno. Reno, boy. - What's this? - What? Two thousand dollars? Oh, no. Will wouldn't do that. Oh, no. "Brother Willy wouldn't do that." Thought it out pretty, didn't he? Marshal will bust his buttons trying to get you and you'll curl them, and the town will posse up and no matter which way you turn they'll be pouring led at you until they get that reward. And brother Willy will be in the clear, and have everything going his way. Pete. Pete. Marshal. Bryant, marshal. He's down behind that little rock by the cut. Get behind the brush and when I shoot, let him have it. Now, hold it. That marshal knows where the hideout is now and he'll be coming back with a posse. You fellas stay covered up inside them rocks and you can pick them all off as they come. Oh, Reb. Reb. You've come back. You're safe. - Where's Martin? - In town. He and Luis were out all night with Father and the vaqueros. - They're still searching for you. - They shouldn't have left you here alone. I'm going to Dallas. I've got to find Martin. He'll come back here. L... I can't wait. Tonight I'll finish up my business in Texas. I won't be back, Tonia. Won't be back? I told you, I wouldn't be here long. Yes, I remember. It's what you wanted. That was three weeks ago. Nothing's changed. Everything's changed, Reb. I can't let you go. You're engaged to Martin. He's the one you're due to marry. What about him? - What about you? - Forget about me. I'm a wanted criminal. Yes, I know that. Martin told you? Why? Was he afraid I'd forget? You haven't answered my question. What about you? I've answered it. Forget me. - You don't mean that. - I do mean it. I have to mean it. A long time ago, it might have been different. You wouldn't have been engaged to Martin. I wouldn't have to be hiding behind his shirttails. I'd have had a name, a home. You have this home. I told you that when you first came. Martin, he's safe. I heard in Dallas. Congratulations, Reb. Did you see Will Marlow? And Trask. Every time he tries to ride out to Bryant, Coulter corners him for a drink. - Popularity is beginning to go to his head. - Matt Coulter? Friendly with the Marlows? It's a scheme of Reb's. Where are you going? He's going to Dallas. I'm going with him. You're staying here, where you belong. Didn't expect to find you here. Thought you'd be waiting in Dallas for Bryant. Bryant will think that too. Or else he'll expect me to organize a posse to come after him. By night, his nerves will get the best of him and he'll come in to see what I am doing. You stay here too. I don't want you underfoot. Reb, what are you going to do about her? I came here gunning for Bryant. When that's done, I'll move on. You don't have to move on. I do have to, you know that. You even told her. You're willing enough to keep it quiet everywhere else. What if you weren't a wanted man free to go or stay? What would you do then? I'd sink my roots in Dallas and take her away from you. Any way I could. Glad you said that. Makes it all right for me to play that way too. You'd be a fool if you didn't. - Where's Reb? - He's gone. - He wants you to stay here with me. - I heard him. But you still want to go with him? You wouldn't want me to pretend. No, I wouldn't want that, but I don't want you to go either. - I must... - Tonia, he has it the way he wants it. What do you mean? Remember what I said about the brutality of hope? There's to be no pardon. He's still a wanted man. Maybe I'm not as smart as I figured. Maybe Bryant's not coming in. Will's not gone to him. I've been thinking. We ain't the kind to get quite so popular... Any fool could see the marshal had rigged me. Now the town's standing against my getting word to Bryant. Any moment he'll come roaring in and... Haven't they got homes to go to? A month ago, there wouldn't have been one of them there. Now you ain't asked them and they're all here expecting that maybe you'll want to send a posse after Bryant. If they rode out there, half of them would never ride back. They know that. They're still willing. You gave us more than a town hall, marshal. You gave us the grit to get our town back. We're willing to fight for it again. Worth fighting for. There's a lot of the history of Dallas standing over there. One fella settled at Trinity Forks when old Johnny Brian was still chinking at his log house. New settlers from the East and South. They're all just Dallas now. I guess that old Scotsman knew what he was writing about when he said: "Breathes there a man with soul so dead..." I know the rest. Glad you do, marshal. We'd be pleased if you'd make this your native land too. You're not talking about me. You're talking about a tin badge and the Weatherby checkbook. Besides, I'm sitting on a short fuse. Hear you all got cotton dirt around here. Pick your half-section, settler. Come far? Through corn lands and cow lands and land oozing filthy grease that dang-near ruined my wagon. Keep that wagon out of there. Great Caesar's ghost. Betty, drive these down a bit. L... I don't wanna roust you around, but this smells like gunfighting weather. Roust all you like, colonel, and if you want a good gun hand again... What are you talking about? Don't you remember me, sir? Hillis from Macon. I rode with your Georgia regiment. Sergeant in Troop C. I never been in Georgia. If that ain't Colonel Reb, this ain't Texas. What did you say? I could swear that's my old colonel... The name, man, the name. You said Reb? I sure did. Colonel Hollister, sir. Fifth Georgia Cavalry. That settler seemed to know you. Don't go probing, judge. That short fuse is about to blow me out of town. How did Will Marlow get away? Will? He's in his office. He just passed me riding south like the hounds of Hades was on his tail. South? Then he's not going to Bryant. You see a man come out of that building? I don't know where he come from, but he lit out like he was turpentine when I said you was Colonel Hollister. You and your big mouth. You were the turpentine. - I didn't mean... - Anyway, you've done one thing: You've proved they were all in it in Georgia. Dogs that ain't kill sheep, don't run. We're gonna catch Will before he sets a long trail. - I'll be back for Bryant. - Good luck, Reb. You fellas stay out of this. Get inside. You ain't gonna talk your way out of it this time, marshal. You won't either, Bryant. You can't fool me. There ain't only one man in the whole world can shoot like that. Reb Hollister. Hollister get my brother, Will. He set the fire in Georgia. Drag out the sour mash. We're drinking to old Reb. Good idea! - Warrant? - Yes, it was his warrant. Reb Hollister. This is impossible. How could he have come here as...? Did you know this? Sure I knew. That's why I put my chips on Dallas. But, judge, how can you be so vindictive? Yesterday he was your hero, and today he's an outlaw. And he's still the same man, a man who's helped all of us. It's not a matter of being vindictive. It's a matter of the law. Only facts have any bearing. Facts? What if they burned your family home to the ground so what they done wouldn't show in the ashes? Reb's father and sister are still missing. Would you think the war was over, judge just because some fellas signed some papers over in Virginia? I wouldn't. Not while the guilty ones was still alive. Reb thought Bryant done it alone, but he learned different. The one who put the torch to the Hollisters' was Will. But he had no right to take the law into his own hands. Rights? He's been drawn and quartered by legal rights. We've all been. I respect the man as much as any of you, but I respect the law more. Weatherby, you've perpetrated a fraud in allowing this criminal to assume your place. It must be reported to the Attorney General. - Reb's no criminal. - No criminal? Here's direct evidence. This is of later origin. It came yesterday. Pardon? On what grounds? Service as a United States Marshal. Have you forgotten he killed Cullen, stopped the cattle raids and now killed Bryant? You had this and didn't tell him? I hoped that Bryant would win the fight. You can blame me that he's gone again thinking himself a criminal. Sure appreciate your interest in this, Mr... - Mr... - Abernathy. Be a feather in my cap picking up a desperado like Reb Hollister. Here he comes. - That's him. - Sure? Don't start arguing. Go on, sheriff, jail him. Keep him there until they get a rope around his neck. Hello, high pockets. How's the...? Been a long time since we picked up anybody who packed a shooting iron in their boot. Better put them on. Them floors get cold. Never mind my health. Look up that fella that gave you the word. His name's not Abernathy. It's Will Marlow. He'll be heading back for Dallas. Take it easy, fella. Judge Tomkins will see you Monday morning. Tell your tale of woe to him. - Monday morning? - Monday morning. Well, that's four... I can't... Make yourself comfortable, boy. You ain't gonna do nothing on that chair nohow. Miguel. Miguel. Wait. You stay here. Who are you? They're my boys, Felipe. Luis. Take the men and get back to your spots. Close the doors and the shutters. - Vultures. - Get your cutthroats out. Yelp all you like. I've been cursed by deadbeats before. You've got no right living like grandees with my note coming due. - Note's not due yet. - It is if I say so. I'm closing my accounts here. I'm taking my rightful money with me now. You've stolen our cattle. We haven't enough left to raise the money. Get it. Tonight? Where? Weatherby. He'll give you the 25,000. - You get nothing! - Would you...? But you don't tell Weatherby why you want it. You do and you'll get your pups back in gunnysacks. But what can I say? You didn't find any trouble thinking up reasons when you wanted to borrow money. If I were you, I'd be in a hurry. I'll pay you. But if you harm them, you'll pay me. - Remember that. - You remember it. Tell the whole town about what... You fool! Are you crazy? Quiet! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Hey, open this door. Open this door. Fire breaks out. We'll get you out of the building. Halt. On your horses! Hurry up! All right, men. Burt, Curly, pick up that wagon. Rest of you boys follow me. But, Mr. Robles, there isn't $25,000 cash in the whole town. - There must be. - But why do you want it? Don't ask me. Don't ask me anything. And say nothing to those you talk to. It means more than my life, Martin. You wait here. - Got it? - From merchants, the banker even Mrs. Walters. It's all here. - You told them nothing? - No, nothing. - You've got to tell me what it's for. - I can't tell you. - Then I'll go with you. - No, no, you mustn't. Does Will Marlow have anything to do with this? - Has he returned to Dallas? - No. Don Felipe, is Tonia all right? I hope so, my boy. "Hope so"? Oh, Mr. Robles. Keep your eyes peeled for old Robles. If he's not alone, tell the men to start shooting. - Where's Will Marlow? - Thought you were following him. He outfoxed me. Got me jugged over in Fort Worth. Means he'll double back here. He has doubled back. That's why Felipe wanted the money. What money? Well, he was here. He made me get him $25,000. He wouldn't say why. - But he said it wasn't Marlow. - What have you got under that hat? Why would anybody keep silent? Because he's got a gun in his back. - Yes, but Marlow wasn't... No. - Marlow wasn't with Felipe? Must mean he's got Tonia and Luis, holding them as hostages. - New gun, huh? - Yeah. I'll go get a posse together. You stay put. I got a ready-made one coming. - How long ago Felipe leave here? - Too long. You can't overtake him. I can try. Bring them along. Well, your pa will be back in a minute or two. Be a comfort to you. Three of you, tied up together. You're making a noose for your neck. This house will tell its secrets. Ashes don't tell secrets. Hollister learned that in Georgia. Robles is coming! Robles is coming. Robles is coming. He's alone. - It's all right. He's alone. - Bring him inside. It's Hollister! Here comes Weatherby and a posse! Open up, Will. Use up your powder, Will, then I'll kill you. What will you do when your bullets are gone, Marlow? You got one left. Didn't figure you for two guns. That leaves five. Fool, wasn't I, Will? I should've killed you weeks ago. But you were smart. You covered your Georgia trail. All I had was Bryant's scent. That's three left, Will. And then I'll kill you. Barehand. Like I dreamed of killing Bry... And all the time it was you that lit the flame. Keep away from the window, Will. You make too good a target. Did you really think the ashes would cover for you, Will? That's your last bullet. Where's Tonia and Luis? I didn't hurt them. They're upstairs. I didn't hurt... Get up on your feet. Let me go. You won't regret it. I'll leave Dallas. I'll never come back. Oh, no. Oh, no, Will. Never. You like to see them burn, remember? Now it's your turn. Your neck, Will. Rope burn, with the whole town looking on. Burn legal, Will. The way you like it. Here's a couple more for you, sheriff. Why, Mr. Abernathy, you've got him again. You'll like him, sheriff. Here. - Antonia, Luis. Where are they? - Upstairs. Will Marlow. He's the wanted one. Antonia. Luis. Antonia. Tonia. Reb. Oh, Reb. Oh, Reb. Well you won my bet for me. - What? Tin-badge bet, remember? You couldn't finish Marlow off, could you? You had your chance, but you couldn't do it. That oath you took as marshal crowded you too much. Here. Free man. Sink your roots in Dallas. Grow your cotton. Raise your kids. Martin... - I hope... - You don't have to say it. I know what your hopes are. Where are you going? Well, somebody's got to tote that cotton. I got me a railroad to build. That Yankee foreigner's talking American. So are you. {{{ the end }}} (FOOTSTEPS ECHOING) BEEFEATER: Admiral Collingwood! Well, Admiral? Great news, Your Majesty! The French are defeated at last. Also the Russians, the Portuguese, the Chinese and the Welsh. Then our navy rules the ocean. Almost entirely, Your Majesty. "Almost"?

(ACCORDION CLANKS) (SCREAMS) (PIRATES GRUNTING) (PIRATES GASP) (ALL QUIET) Sorry, Captain. We were just discussing what's the best bit about being a pirate. Oh, YOU were, were you? I suggested it might be the looting. Whereas I contend it's the shiny cutlasses. And I thought it was the chance to catch exotic diseases. Hmm. Well, you're, all of you, wrong. The best bit about being a pirate isn't the looting or the cutlasses. It's not the grog or the scurvy. Or the scantily clad mermaids. The best bit about being a pirate is Ham Night! (CHEERING) Ham Night! (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) PIRATE: Ham Night! ALL: Ham! (CHEERING, EXCITED CHATTER CONTINUES) (LAUGHTER) PIRATE: On your nose. Go, Captain. Go, Captain. Hey! Hey! (PANTS RIP) Ooh!

Behind every captain with glittering eyes and a luxuriant beard... Luxuriant! That's what it is. (CHEERING) ...there's a crew of briny rogues. Briny rogues! Sure, some of you are as ugly as a sea cucumber. Will you get away with ya? Some of you are closer to being a chair or coat rack than a pirate. And some of you are just fish I've dressed up in a hat. But you're still the best crew a captain could wish for. (CHEERING) Oh, oh! Don't forget Polly. And not forgetting, never forgetting Polly. The finest parrot to sail the seven seas. Come on, girl.

Yeah, yeah, brilliantly, brilliantly. Thanks for asking. (CHUCKLES) Treasure coming out of my eyeballs. Taken to washing my hair in 50-pound notes. CUTLASS LIZ: Oh, really?

People to skewer. (SQUAWKS) (CHOKING) Huh? Ugh! Ooh. Oh, come on! That is disgusting. Wait a minute. Captain, what is this? What? Captain? Oh, that's nothing. Could I possibly have that back? Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait. Thank you. "Pirate of the Year"? (LAUGHTER) You're entering Pirate of the Year? No, no, no, no, no. (LAUGHS) Uh, yes. Again? Yes! (LAUGHTER) BOTH: Ooh! Come on. Listen, did they change the rules? I mean, I always thought they gave it to the pirate with the most booty. Do they now just give it to the guy with the fattest parrot? She is not fat. She's just big-boned. She's fat, dude. (LAUGHTER) Yeah, go on. Go on, then, laugh. Everyone laugh. (LAUGHTER) Ignore them, Captain. It's not worth it. The trophy would just clash with your wallpaper, anyway. (LAUGHTER CONTINUES) You'll see, you'll see. I will be Pirate of the Year. Oh, yes. And then you'll be laughing on the other side of your faces. Yes. And believe me, that is a very painful thing to do. Come on, lads. (LAUGHTER) Well... (CLEARS THROAT) All right, now listen up, you coves. 'We'll show those swabs a thing or two about pirating. (CHEERING) There's still time to fill these chests with sparkling booty. I can practically taste that trophy! (CHANTING) Trophy! Trophy! Trophy! (GUNSHOT) (CHEERING) Captain! Sail off the port bow! Aha! Let's get after her, Number Two. Aye, aye, sir. Clap on all sail! Royals and topgallants! PIRATE: Release those gallants! Aha! (CLAMORING) Fire those long things that go bang. Fire cannons four and six! (CHEERING) Eat cannonball, lubbers. (SQUAWKING) Here we go, lads! Look and learn. Yee-haw! (CHEERING) Go get 'em, Pirate Captain! Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain. And I'm here for your gold. Gold? This is a plague boat, old man. I'd give my right arm for some gold. (GAS PS) Or my left. (CHUCKLES) PIRATE CAPTAIN: Right, lads. Minor hiccup, that last one. This time, it's payday! (CHEERING) Aha! I'm the Pirate Captain, and I'm here for your gold. Geography field trip. Aha! I'm the Pirate Captain, and... Naturists. Pirate Captain. Blah, blah, blah, blah, gold. Ghost ship. (ALL WAILING) (SINISTER LAUGH) Sorry. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Mmm. Captain, we've sighted another ship, sir. Mm-hmm. That's nice. Do you want to give the order to attack? No, not really, Number Two. No, I think I've... Think I had enough of piracy. I'm hanging up my cutlass. Captain, no! Yeah, I was thinking I might go into baby clothes, actually. What? I hear there's a fortune to be made in baby clothes because babies grow so fast. No, but you can't. I mean, the crew... They'd... They'd be lost without you. Oh, what was I thinking, Number Two? Pirate of the Year? Me? Look at the trophy cabinet. Best Anecdote About a Squid. I mean, that is all I've got to show for my entire career. (STAMMERING) Pirate of the Year? It's just commercialized nonsense. Real piracy isn't about trophies. It's about fighting up staircases backwards. It's about sliding down sails with a knife in your teeth. Beard glossiness! And think about all the adventures we've had. Our adventure with Aztecs. Our adventure with that pig. Our adventure with... Shh! Okay, maybe not the librarians. But the fun we've had. And what about the shanties? Well, I mean... People would miss my shanties. And the running people through. Well, I... I do enjoy running people through. Enjoy it? You're brilliant at it! You're a brine-soaked terror of the high seas! Do you think so, Number Two? Everyone does! You're more of a pirate than Black Bellamy or any of them. You're a real pirate. That's why the crew, they think you're the best thing since boil-in-the-bag ham. Why do you think they all got that tattoo? Come on. What do you say? Arrr! By Neptune, where's that ship? MAN: Ooh! This is the one, lads! (PIRATES GASP) Ninth time lucky! I can feel it in my beard! Well, don't just sit there like lemons! Hoist the flag! Standard, sir? Or extra gruesome? PIRATE CAPTAIN: Extra gruesome! Let's make their gizzards shake. (CHEERING) DARWIN: Journal of Charles Darwin. Day 93 aboard the Beagle. I have, today, discovered a new kind of barnacle, which I have categorized in the order of Pygophora. (SIGHS SOFTLY) I'll never get a girlfriend. lam so unhappy. (THUMPING) (CANNONBALL WHISTLING THROUGH AIR) (CANNONS FIRING IN DISTANCE) And now I'm being attacked by pirates. (PIRATES CLAMORING) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (CHUCKLES) Avast! I'm the Pirate Captain, and I'm here for your gold. (GAS PS) (STAMMERS) I haven't got any gold. No gold, eh? Then what, might I ask, is this? It's a baboon's kidney. Is it? Oh. And what about this? Oh, it's another baboon's kidney. (GAS PS) We searched the hold, Captain. And? Just creatures. Bits of creatures in jars. And an unhappy-looking baboon. What kind of ship is this? (GAS PS) (STAMMERING) We're a... Well, we were a scientific expedition. Charles Darwin, at your service, sir. Oh, for pity's sake! Is it so much to ask? Is it? I just want one tiny bit of success! One teensy weensy bit of respect from my peers just once in my life! Is that such a crime? Is it? (GAS PS) No? No! (GASPS) No. Oh, but you try telling that to the universe. Just once, just once for things to go right. Just... Just once. So, are we done here? (WIND WHISTLING SOFTLY) DARWIN: Dear Diary, about to meet a watery grave. NUMBER TWO: It's nothing personal, you understand. It's just... It's been a tough week, and a good plank walk usually cheers him up. Will die without reaching second base with a lady. Oh, get on with it! Today's weather: inclement. (SQUAWKING) (GASPING) Stop! PIRATE CAPTAIN: Oh, now what? Last request, is it? Do we have to grant those? Is there some sort of human rights convention we're signed up to? But that bird! My parrot? She's just big-boned! No, she's not. I mean... I mean, she's not a parrot. Not a parrot? What's he on about, old girl? She's... She's... She's the scientific discovery of our age! She's a... (PLANK THUMPS, DARWIN SCREAMS) (SPLASH) Huh? Sorry. It's just, that's my favorite bit. (CHIRPING) A dodo, you say? They've been extinct for 150 years. To find one alive today, it's quite incredible. Whoa! Well, clever old girl. Not going extinct. If I might be so bold, I would be prepared to pay you 10 pounds for your Polly. (LAUGHTER) Polly's not for sale. Ten pound. She's one of the family. She's like an auntie. With a beak. Yeah, I'm afraid they're right, Charles. Polly here is the feathery heart and soul of the boat. Come on, little dodo. Oh. (GRUNTING) It's such a missed opportunity. If I could've presented her in London to the Royal Society at their annual science show... (CHUCKLES) No question of that, I'm afraid. She'd have been an absolute sensation. Yeah, well, can't be helped. And of course a shoo-in for the top prize. Prize? For best scientific discovery. Yes. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. This prize, valuable, is it? Valuable? (GASPING, LAUGHING) It's priceless. Untold riches. (CASH REGISTER DINGS) Captain... No, no, no, no. I was thinking, perhaps perhaps I was being a touch hasty. But, Captain, London? The home of Queen Victoria, mortal enemy of pirates everywhere? We'll end up hanged at Execution Dock. (PIRATES GASP) (SCOFFS) Oh, pah! We laugh in the face of danger, remember? Um, I don't. I don't really like danger at all. (SIGHS) Captain, do you remember the little talk we had? The one about whether pigs are actually a type of fruit? No. No. The one about us trying to avoid harebrained schemes that end in us facing certain death. You heard the man, Number Two. "Untold riches." Here's the plan. We go to London, Polly wins this science show thingy we take the prize money, I enter Pirate of the Year, I win! Bingo! But, Captain, I'm not sure... It can't fail. And besides, look at her little face. (HIGH-PITCHED) I sure want to win that science prize. Squawk! Bravo, Captain! I see you're a man of vision! Right, then, Charles. When is this science show of yours? A week tomorrow. Ah, confound it! You see, we could've made that with a good wind behind us, but unfortunately there's this dirty great sea monster in the way. Um, mmm, I think they just add those onto maps for decoration, Captain. Is that a fact? Well, blow me down. (LAUGHS) I dare, you could learn something from this fine fellow, Number Two. J' London calling to the faraway towns J' London calling to the faraway towns J' Now war is declared and battle come down J' London calling to the underworld (GIGGLING) J' Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls J' London calling, see, we ain't got no high ? 'Cept for that one with the yellowy eyes J' Now get this J' London calling, yes, I was there, too J' And you know what they said? Well, some of it was true J' London calling at the top of the dial J' And after all this, won't you give me a smile? PIRATE CAPTAIN: Ah! London Town. The most romantic city in the world. J' I never felt so much alike alike, alike, alike... J' (SHIP CREAKING) "Queen Victoria "welcomes you to London." Ah, that's nice. Perhaps she's not so bad after all. (ALL GASP) Well, don't look so worried, Number Two. Pirates are always visiting London. (MOANING EERILY) Turn back! This is the fate of pirates here! Is that Scarlett Morgan? (CHUCKLES) Pirate Captain. Goodness me! I haven't seen you since that business in Madagascar. Ah, yes. I could've sworn they were girls. You're looking well, Morgan. Yeah, lost a bit of weight. What are you up to these days? Oh, you know, this and that. Yeah, just gonna enter a science competition, actually. Ah! Good luck with that. Yeah, thanks, thanks. Eh? (DISTANT WAILING) No, no, wait, wait! Turn back! Turn back. (SHIP CREAKING) (SHIP CRASHES) Oops. Sorry. Oh, no! Look what you've done to me boat. Look at the state of it. I hope you've got some insurance, 'cause I... (ANCHOR CLANKS) Ow. Right, then. We'll be off. I'll bring her back tomorrow straight after the show. Well, don't be daft, Charles. I'll be presenting Polly. You? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I always fancied trying my hand at a spot of science. But you can't. I mean, the streets of London are no place for pirates. Pirates? What pirates? (GAS PS) Nobody here but us Girl Guides. Yes! I've got a badge for looting. We're not really Girl Guides. It's us, the pirates. We're masters of disguise. How ingenious. But all the same, Captain, best we lie low for the night. Perhaps at my house. Captain, I really think... Good plan, Chuck. Be fun to see how you boffin types live. Mmm-hmm. Well, come on. Taxi! Evening, Officer. Hidey-ho, ladies. (GIGGLES) (SNIFFING) ALBINO PIRATE: London smells like Grandma. Whoa. (HORSE NEIGHS) Here we are. Home, sweet home. You don't get many women back here, do you, Charles? People who live alone are always serial killers. (GAS PS) (GAS PS) PIRATE CAPTAIN: Sweet Neptune on a bike! DARWIN: Oh, don't mind Mr. Bobo. Just an old project of mine. Project? Yeah, I had this theory. I thought that if you took a monkey, gave him a monocle and covered up his gigantic, unsightly ass, then he would cease to be a monkey and become more of a... A man-panzee, if you will. Bold theory. I don't like the monkey. But to be honest, monkeys are 10 a penny. He's not a patch on Polly here. Oh! Anyhow, big day tomorrow. We all need our rest. Let me show you to your room, Captain. PIRATE CAPTAIN: Right behind you, Chuck. (GRUNTS) (TOILET FLUSHES) (GAS PS) DARWIN: (WHISPERING) Now, shh, here's the plan. You know what to do. Wait until the bearded idiot is asleep, then sneak into his room and... Shh! (FLOORBOARD CREAKS) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Captain. It's... It's Mr. Darwin, sir. I'm sure he's up to no good. Oh, honestly, Number Two, what's got into you? Thanks to Charles, we're about to win lavish untold riches, and here you are trying to find fault with the poor fellow. Yes, but... No, no, no. Not another word. A future Pirate of the Year needs his beauty sleep. Do you think you could make nautical noises until we drop off? (MAKING WHOOSHING SOUNDS) Oh, that's lovely. Now, that is lovely. Can you do the shiver a timber? (SIGHS) Oh... Mmm. (IMITATES WOOD CREAKING) (YAWNS) And just chuck in a few gulls, would you? Caw, caw, caw! (SNORING) (SNORING LOUDLY) (YAWNS) (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (GRUNTING SOFTLY) ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, our winner. Give it up for the Pirate Captain! Congratulations, Pirate Captain. Nobody deserves this more than you. (CHUCKLES) Thanks, Cutlass. And that beard of yours, (GASPS) it drives me crazy. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (GAS PS) (LAUGHING) Give it here. (STRAINING) Give it back, Bellamy, it's mine! No, give it back. (LAUGH ECHOES) (STARTLED SHOUT) Neptune's navel! Come back here, you lubber. Stop, thief! (GRUNTS) (SQUAWKS) (GRUNTS) I'll take that. (RUMBLING) Not so fast, my friend. (SCREAMS) Number Two! Number Two, are you all right? (GAS PS) Unhand that dodo! Whoa! (SCREAMS) (GAS PS) Evening, Captain. (FLOORBOARDS CREAKING, CRACKING) (BOTH SCREAMING) (WATCH TICKING) (THUDDING, CLATTERING) (BOTH SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (GAS PS) (BOTH SCREAM) Oh, Number Two! (SCREAMS) (ALL SCREAMING) (SCREAMS) We're under attack! Abandon ship! (ALL SCREAMING) Hello, Pirate Captain, Pirate with a Scarf! (SCREAMING CONTINUES) Come back here, Mysterious Shadowy Figure! (GAS PS) Faster! Faster! (GAS PS) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (PIRATES SCREAMING) Got you! Are you all right, girl? Captain! I mean, what's going on? Don't play the innocent. You and your hench-monkey tried to steal Polly. Steal Polly? Oh, dear me, no, you're mistaken. Then how do you explain this? (DOOR CREAKS) Well, I think it's obvious what's happened, isn't it? Is it? Some jealous rival scientist must have tried to make off with the dodo. Well, that explains everything. Captain, please, let's go. Polly's not safe in London. I couldn't bear it if something happened to Polly. Nothing is going to happen to Polly. She'll be perfectly safe. Leave everything to me. Now, come on, we can't keep that prize waiting. (CLEARS THROAT) Um... Anyone got a towel? DARWIN: Nice going, banana butt. Now this briny buffoon is gonna grab all the glory. It's a disaster. It's... (SPUTTERS) Bad news, I'm afraid, Captain. You can't go in. Eh? Mmm. It's strictly scientists only, you see. I'll just have to present Polly myself. We're not really scientists. It's us, the pirates. See? (CHUCKLES) Masters of disguise. But where's Polly? That is on a need-to-know basis from here on in, Charles. Pardon? I am keeping her hidden. That shadowy figure could be anywhere. Luckily, I am not only a master of disguises, I am also a master of hiding things. Right, lads, let's show these boffins what's what. But, Captain. Really, I... Hello! (BELL DINGS) We're here for the science show. We're scientists. Hmm? That's a pipette, this is Charles Darwin, and I am the Scientist Captain. If you're a scientist, name three elements. Oh, well, let's see now. There's... There's gold, ham... Mmm-hmm? ...and the tears of a mermaid. Yeah, two out of three Close enough. First on your left. The balloon of my airship contains 20,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas. Excuse me. Sorry. (GASPS) Just here, you will notice the open log fire to ensure a comfortable temperature at higher altitudes. (PEOPLE GRUNT) Ooh! Captain? Captain, Captain, please. You can't possibly appear on stage without Polly. Patience, Charles. All in good time. (SINISTER LAUGH) Excuse me. Sorry. (ANGRY GRUNTING) Sorry. SCIENTIST: Idiot! Just a tick. Oh, but, Captain... (SQUAWKS) How on earth did... My airship will revolutionize the fields of meteorology and cartography. (SLURPING) But mostly, it's for looking down ladies' tops. (APPLAUSE) Ingenious. (METER muss) (SINGING SCALES) Captain, I really, really think it would be best if I take over from here. There's a certain manner in which these things are conduc... Nonsense, Chuck. What this science stuff needs is a bit of showmanship! (GROWLS) (GAS PS) (WHIMPERS) (SCREAMS) Look, it's the captain. Captain! Captain! Shh! Fellow scientists, poindexters, geeks, (GROANS) prepare to be confounded. Prepare to be amazed. Prepare to... Oh-ho, wait a second. What's this? (CLEARS THROAT) What's this? Stop! (CLEARS THROAT) I am the world's leading doctor, and I declare the science you are doing is too shocking by half. Dr. Albino, are you saying that those of a nervous disposition should leave immediately, in case the sheer unexpected remarkableness of my discovery should cause their hearts to explode? (SIGHS) Uh... lam. Well, science lovers, you have been warned. This is our most educational adventure ever. (PLAYING ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA) Back from the dead. Back from beyond the grave. Back to astound you all. The ninth wonder of the world. She's traveled halfway across the globe to be here tonight. Here's Polly! (CROWD GAS PS) MAN: It's a dodo. (GAS PS) By Jove. That is astounding! (CHEERING) (SIGHS) (METER muss) (GASPS, SIGHS WEAKLY) (METER muss) An actual dodo! Makes electricity look like a pile of crap. (LIGHT BULB CRACKLING WITH ELECTRICITY) MAN: The Royal Society's prize for best scientific discovery... Oh, I hope it's not a check. ...Is awarded to... Have you any idea what the sterling-doubloon exchange rate is these days? ...the Scientist Captain. (APPLAUSE) Thank you, thank you. You're too kind. Please stop. Enough. Thank you. Thank you. (GASPS) Is that it? Oh, no. Ah, good. You also get this leather-bound set of encyclopedias. Excuse me just one moment. Thank you. (GROANS) Okay, Chuck. Now, I like encyclopedias as much as the next man, but they're not exactly gonna help me win Pirate of the Year, are they? (GLASS SHATTERS) Where's the booty? Booty? What booty? The prize! The "untold riches," remember? Oh. Perhaps I didn't explain. It's not all about money. No, the real prize is... MAN: Her Royal Majesty, the Empress of India, Ruler of the Kingdom of Java a personal audience with Defender of the Faith, Queen Victoria! Queen Victoria herself. (GASPS) (GAS PS) Scientist Captain, congratulations. What a tremendous discovery. (STAMMERING) Your, uh... Your Majesty. And who are these charming fellows? Well, this is my crew. By which he means lab assistant crew. Yes, yes. I'm using "crew" in the street sense. Yo. And I'm Charles Darwin, Your Majesty. I helped find the dodo. Yes, whatever. But where has your delightful creature disappeared to? Resting, ma'am. Hidden away. I only let her out for the big performance, I'm afraid. In case sinister forces should try to make off with her, you see. Sinister forces? Ooh, dear. Well, we have a wonderful petting zoo at the palace where Polly would be quite safe. Perhaps we could take her off your hands. (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's out of the question. But she'd have a lovely time. There are guinea pigs and a donkey. No, no, I couldn't, ma'am. Not even for little old me? No, no, no, I'm afraid not, ma'am. No, you see, there is nothing more important to a pirate than his trusted dodo. (GASPS) She is the feathery heart and soul of the boat. Did you say "pirate"? (MEN GASP) Pirate? No, no, no, no, no. Scientist. (CHUCKLES) Yes, good old, good old science. Can't get enough of it. Mixing stuff together. You know, test tube tubing and Bunsen burning. See? (GRUNTS) (MEN GASPING) He's no scientist! He's a Girl Guide! Ooh! (GRUNTS) (MEN GASPING) He's no Girl Guide! He's a pirate! BOTH: Pirate! Hang on, hang on. There's been some kind of mistake. Some... (GRUNTS) Some silly mistake Whoa, laddies! Stop, stop. I can explain. (GAS PS) Your Majesty. He's hidden the dodo. If you chop his head off now, we might never find out where. Wait a mo. (GAS PS) One doesn't know why. Perhaps it's his luxuriant beard or his gleaming teeth or the way he smells faintly of coconuts. But we have taken a shine to this pirate. Do you have a name, pirate captain? They call me the Pirate Captain. Well, Pirate Captain, we hereby pardon you of your piratical crimes. (APPLAUSE) (MEN GASP) You will stay in London, Pirate Captain, and entertain us with your stories and your wit. And especially your dear little dodo. Hell's barnacles. Can we please get out of here now? That was a bit close for comfort, Number Two. I will get you the dodo, Your Majesty. See that you do, Mr. Darwin. (HOOVES CLOPPING) (CHUCKLES WEAKLY) Ooh! Uh... Captain? Captain! Captain! Hurry up, lads, chop-chop. Let's get back to sea where we belong. PIRATES: Aye, aye, Captain! I told you coming to London was a bad idea. The sooner I get the smell of brine in my... DARWIN: Captain! Captain! Whoa! Whoa! (GAS PS) You're not leaving, surely? I most certainly am. You've let me down badly, Charles. Look! Look! Also, to be frank... Captain your nose is too small for your face. But you're the toast of London Town. Oh, I say, look at that. Ooh! They've really captured my eyes. We were hoping you might come out for a little celebration before you go. (PEOPLE CHUCKLING) We don't want to miss the tide, Captain. No, no, no. Quite right, quite right. Oh, Captain, do join us, please? I'll just stop for a quick one. Rude to refuse. But it's Ham Night. I'll be 20 minutes. Half an hour tops. Just get her... Get her warmed up without me. Aren't we going yet? Shh! (WHISPERING) But what about winning the Pirate of the Year and showing all those other captains that he's not a loser? (SIGHS) WOMAN: Yoo-hoo! Come along, Captain. Captain... Cheers! Good evening. Thank you. Thank you so very much. Captain... PIRATE CAPTAIN: And your name is? DARWIN: Miss Jane Austen. (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) (ANCHOR CLANKS) (MAN SCREAMS) (LIVELY PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE LAUGHING) PIRATE CAPTAIN: And that, and that is why, in a straight fight, a shark would probably beat a Dracula. (CHUCKLES) Jane Austen, feel free to use it in one of your books. Oh, Pirate Captain, you are a born raconteur. So much better than the last chap we all went doolally over. You've all been (SLURPING) terribly kind. Oh! Oh, do run along. Another drink, Captain? Hmm? Cheers, Chuck. Huh? I say, you're not related in some way, are you? Pardon? It's just you, sort of... Well, no, no, nothing, nothing, nothing. Cheers. Do you know what I've discovered, Charles? The friends you make after you've become famous are better, truer friends than the ones you've had for years beforehand. So very wise. But the lads will think I'm a fool. No. A fool, you? Oh. You're an intellectual giant. Just look at how you managed to keep Polly safe from those sinister forces. Yes, I did do that, didn't I? You did. And wherever she's hidden, I bet it's somewhere really ingenious. It is rather. (CHUCKLES) You'll never guess where. Well, no, why, you're too smart for me, Captain. Right under everyone's noses. Or right under my noses, anyhow. Ta-d a! (SQUAW KS) (GAS PS) (SIGHS) You've been keeping Polly in your beard? Actually, I keep all sorts in here. (CLOCK TICKING) I'm sorry about this, Captain. About what? Oh. What the... What's the monkey-man playing at? (CHUCKLES) This patently isn't even a real... (SCREAMS) (GAS PS) (GAS PS) Come back here, you lubbers! (BICYCLE BELL DINGS) (SCREAMS) Sorry, Your Reverence. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (CHICKENS SQUAWKING) (PIG SNORTING) (WHISTLE BLOWS) (GAS PS) (GRUNTING) Aha! Got you, you rogue! (RUMBLING) (MUZAK PLAYING) Yeah, that's rather nice. Neptune's lips, what are you up to? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's not my fault. What do you mean "not your fault"? You steal Polly, you shoot my best hat full of holes. (CLANKING) (GASPS) (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Hmm? Well, go on, then. Explain yourself. There's this girl. I'm hopelessly smitten with her. I'm listening. I know how partial she is to exotic animals, and I thought if I could get her the dodo, then she might like me. Oh, I'm so ashamed. (SOBBING) Why didn't you say so? We've all done stupid things to impress girls. Yeah, you to draw blood and break bones? There's no intent to injury in hockey. Are we watching the same games? How do you think it's going in there? A father's worst nightmare. Were you and your son close, Mr. Cooper? Mr. Cooper. Close? I don't know. We weren't talkers, exactly. (sigh) Did Jared and Stacy have any marital issues that you know of? Yeah, they had their problems. Sure. Jared was training and training's expensive. He quit his job in the body shop to fight full time. Stacy was trying to manage his career. Worked two jobs. Sounds like a pretty stressful situation. - She surprised me. - What do you mean? I thought, you know, not much there, except a nice set of... She straightened him out. How so? Jared grew up watching me fight. He slept in a few dressing rooms. He had his diapers changed by ring girls. He was a pretty angry kid. When was the last time you talked to your son? (short pause) After his last fight. Did he seem depressed at all? Did he talk about harming himself in any way? No. I was trying to give him some advice. He didn't care much for what I had to say. I told him he was slow, his injuries were catching up with him. I told him he was lazy. He wasn't. I don't know why I said that. - Does he have any other family? - No. - Mother? - Long gone. You're going to do an investigation, right? - That's why we're here. - When you find who did it, let me have a crack at him before you lock him up. - Mr. Cooper... - Jared was a lot of things, but he didn't kill that girl or himself. You may have to prepare yourself for the possibility that your son wasn't exactly who you thought he was. Yeah. We'll keep you posted of any developments in the case. (cell phone ringing) Martin, could you see Mr. Cooper out, please? Of course. (cell phone ringing) (sigh) Danny. Hey! So, Margie Reynolds has priors. Murder? Break and enter? She smuggled fruit back from Florida, what? Apparently, she's making a habit of throwing rocks at cars. Been charged twice with mischief, once with vandalism for keying a car. I only went back five years. - Does she have a lawyer? - She wants to represent herself. - And you let her? - We barely know this woman. - Where is she? - She's in holding. Jess, don't make her your little project, OK? I got to go. OK. Fair warning. As my arresting officer, I intend to tear you apart on the stand. - You can't represent yourself. - Why not? You have three convictions. You're going to have to shoot your way out of the courtroom if you don't want to go to jail. I'll get bail and the system will lose track of me...because I'm old. Are you retired? I play piano. You know, recitals, dance classes, malls. Don't like the malls much, but... Is there anyone you can call? I've had four husbands, but not one of them would want to pick me up. You know, three, you can blame the man. Four, you got to start thinking it's you. Any kids? Now, how many husbands have you had? What number are you on? - Three. - Whoa! Only got one more in you. Best before date kind of creeps up, though. You know, better make the change soon before you become invisible. - Let me get you a lawyer. - I don't want a lawyer! Just drop the charges and give me a ride home! Well, I can't... (Her cell phone vibrates.) An old lady should be able to cross the street without fearing for her life. I have to... OK. Let me see what I can do. Great, thanks! I'll just wait here. - What's going on in there? - Personal project. What's up? Preliminary autopsy report. No recreational drugs, but Jared was juiced. - Steroids. Side effect: rage. Ah, for the days of a multivitamin and a good inight's sleep. I don't remember the last time I had a root beer. (sigh) I train at the same gym as Jared Cooper. What? I started training in MMA techniques a while back. I needed to shake things up, so I started... Fight crime with your bare hands? What else did the report say? Jared had two broken knuckles and a recently torn ligament in his shooting hand. There is no way he could have pulled the trigger at that angle. - Jared's father called it. - It's a double murder. The gym thing. I can recuse myself from the case. Did you know Jared Cooper? - Saw him around a bit, but... - What about Stacy? - No. - It's all good. Jess. No one there knows I'm a cop. Well, that's about to change. Don't worry, Spears: Change, it's a good thing! So if Stacy and Jared were murdered, first question: who was the primary target? Stacy was shot in the back, trying to run away. She had no priors, no known criminal connections. Jared's bullet wound was a clear and deliberate killing path. No struggling, no flinching. - He didn't see it coming. - Or he know it was coming and just accepted his fate. Which means it was either an execution or a friend. Or an execution by a friend. - Jared was our primary target. - And Stacy came home at the wrong time. And the killer staged it to look like a murder suicide. The MMA fight scene's littered with gangs: it could be connected. Get Ident to take apart the gun, do a DNA swab in the parts and the bullet casings. Maybe the shooter left something behind. Uh, Stacy's most recent phone calls were to a Clover Harcourt. Clover? That's a nice name. We called and sent unis over to her place, but she hasn't been home. - OK. Let's drill down on Jared Cooper: who were his friends, his enemies, both inside and outside the ring. - Cage. - Oh! Cage. Spears, check out Jared's gym. You know where it is, right? Martin, Ingrid: Head back to the house, have another look around. - What are you going to do? - Floss. After that, I have to deal with a... (Sighing): A personal project. I already gave you a statement. I want your permission now as the prosecution to drop the charges. - No way! - She's a lonely, old woman. ...Who's a danger to society. OK. What if it were your mother? I'd throw rocks right back at her. It took me four years to save up and buy that car. - I know. - Now, there are chips in it. In the paint. I know. - It's going to oxidize. - What? It's going to rust. Those chips turn to rust. You know, rust! OK! So that's why you want to throw an old woman in jail? Rust? She assaulted me. OK, Carmen: you really want to go through a whole court care? Because the law favours pedestrians over cars. And juries love little old ladies. Which is ageism: Totally unfair! OK. What if I bring Miss Reynolds here and she apologizes? Would that do it? Whatever - This part depresses me. - What's that? Opening fridges at crime scenes. Forgotten food in the crisper, jar of milk, fresh vegetables that will never get cooked. Busy girl: Workout, jobs, meetings. Pff! Premix protein shakes, soy milk. Now, what are you? Broken. Look at this curious thing. What do you suppose that is? It's a... an airbag. Put your hand on the bicep, put the hand behind the head. Then, basically, you just break the neck. - Billy, you got a minute? - You get laid off or something? - No. - Never seen you here in the middle of the day. You're a narc? Major crimes task force. I need you to open up Jared Cooper's locker for me.. I'll get the clippers. Why? Why should I apologize? Because you don't want to go to jail. - Says who? - Margie! Would you apologize? - Probably not. - Didn't think so. - Yeah, but I wouldn't get caught, either. - Ha! (short pause) Yeah, I hate prison. OK, I'll say I'm sorry. Good. I'll get Danny to take you out there. I'd love to ride around with him! (snorting) Uh, why are you doing this? I'm just like, you know, some old lady. Whose daughter was hit and killed by a car. At a crosswalk. I checked back in the system. Why didn't you say something? Talking doesn't help. - Throwing rocks does? - And music. So you... you have no kids? (short pause) No. But you have your work and a very handsome husband. Still lonely sometimes though, huh? Yeah. Guys, clear out. Here it is. You're investigating Jared's murder. Heard it all over the news. - Did you ever spar with him? - Yeah. Kicked my ass. When was the last time you saw him? Last week. Did he say or do anything unusual? Talked to us about his last fight. That's about it. I thought you were here about those pills. What pills? (Spears clears his throat.) You tell me you're a cop upfront before you join my club, cool. You don't tell me, I and everyone else will figure that you're undercover. Not cool. I'm just a guy trying to learn a few new moves. Excuse me. Yeah, well. Watch your back next time you step into the cage. Billy. Mr. Cooper. Sorry about... you know. I heard the news. Jared said... He said he did some work for someone, like doing some things on the side. Yeah, I don't know. It's just... Who was he working for? Go home, Mr. Cooper. Help me out here, man. Who was it? What's his name? No... Mr. Cooper! Hey. (shouting) What's your problem, huh? Wanna mess with me? Hey! Hey! Break it up! What do you think you're doing, huh? - Self-defence, man. It was just self-defence. He killed my son! He killed my son! Stay there. I sat in that chair right there and told you he was murdered, but you didn't listen! - Mr. Cooper! - As soon as we got the autopsy results, we shifted the investigation. Yeah, but I knew. I knew. Here. Tell us about Aaron Dixon. - Aaron Dixon? That's his name? - What happened at the gym? Jared said he worked for... he did some work for some gang banger he met at the dog pound. - What kind of work? - Mr. Cooper. Stacy was doing too much already. Jared said he just wanted to make some dough fast to help out. Dixon did it, you know that, right? - What kind of work was your son doing for him? - I don't know. Whatever it was... Stace made him quit. Sarah said that Dixon was really pissed. Aaron Dixon's been up on weapons charges twice, one conviction. Calls his crew the North Side Boys. They have a reputation for gun violence. And we know his crew spends a lot of time at the dog pound. Find anything in Jared's locker when you were there? Nothing. [Sultrily]: Of all the gyms in the city, Spears, you join that one. I train and I leave, that's it. And you ignore the gangsters and the drugs. When I run into some kid on a call, and I'll be ready. It's a new world out there. - So those 8 minutes in the ring... - Cage. - Whatever. That's your fountain of youth? You should try a spa. - Hey, boss. - How'd it go at the house? - We kyboshed. We came up with nothing new. But we got some air bags. Jared and Stacy own the car, but all the air bags are still in place. So, what? Jared was selling black market air bags for Dixon? - You can get $1,500 a pop for some models. - Call Robbery and see if they know anything that can help us out. Where are we at with finding Stacy's friend, Clover? Nothing yet. Look harder. She disappeared after the murders, that might say something. Somebody just tried to kill me, and you're acting like I'm guilty? I didn't have to come here. I appreciate it very much. It's all right. The old man? He's pretty messed up. Seemed to connect pretty good. Yeah, Jared said his pops had fast hands back in the day. - So you knew Jared Cooper? - Yeah, man. Everyone at the gym knew Jared. He was a fierce man. His father seems to think that Jared was working for you. Nah. Jared was all about the ring. Didn't have time to work for me. So why would his father say something like that? You'll have to ask him. - Could someone confirm your whereabouts last night? - Yeah, I got my crew. We were at my place, watching the fights. - Did you know Stacy Cooper, Jared's wife? - Yeah, man. She was cool. She used to be a ring girl, right? Jared lucked out with that one. Sad about her, too. Do you recognize these? Nah. Is that some kind of parachute or what? Hey, you got an extra pole and a hat? - What? - If you're just fishing, I need my own fishing rod and cap. You know, keep the sun out my eyes. Can I go? How'd it go with Margie today? (He laughs.) Fine. She, uh... She seemed genuinely sorry that she chipped the paint on the car. So... Hey, uh... What's the word in Homicide? Not good. Graci's pretty peeved. Hm. You think he'll be cleaning house or...? - Do you wanna make a move? - I just... If a spot opens up, I mean, why not? It would be pretty difficult if we had a kid, both of us working 24/7. Right. Well, I didn't... See, I didn't know that was still possibly a plan, Jess. - I've been thinking about adoption. - What? - Wait, wait. There's Graci. - No, can... When any individual intentionally misleads the court, it does tremendous damage to our justice system. Perjury... - Why is this so difficult to talk about? - I don't know. Well, maybe that's what needs to change. Maybe we'll be okay without kids, wandering the streets alone... You are not alone. And Margie is only alone because she's crazy. I like her coat. Those deep pockets? You could stash 3 pairs of shoes and a change of clothes in those things. (He laughs.) Hey, uh... How long have you been thinking about adoption? - Stash box. - What? The air bags. Jared was building stash boxes. What? Where's my mug? That's the work he was doing with Dixon. He was removing air bags, installing dummy gas tanks, customizing the cars so that... So Dixon and his boys could smuggle... Drugs, guns, whatever. If Jared built all of Dixon's stash boxes, then he would know all of Dixon's hiding places. And if he just up and left, then Dixon wouldn't necessarily love the idea that he was walking out with company secrets. Dixon had Jared killed and made it look like a suicide. - How are we gonna prove that? - We start by looking in all of Dixon's hiding places. ♪ So, how's about we bring Aaron Dixon back in? We found these pills all tucked away safe and sound in your 4x... - I don't know who put those there, but... - You put them there, Aaron. In the stash boxes that Jared Cooper built. It's just 'roids, man. You might as well arrest me for drinking beer on a sidewalk. We checked your crew's cars too, found more HGH and a gun. Caron, the guy with the gun? You can't stop that guy from talking. - Nothing to do with me. - Not true. Got you for importation of a controlled substance... 1 to 5 years for a first of fence. Given your record, I can do a lot more. You're one of those overachieving types, I guess. The higher the heel, the happier I am. So Jared, what? He tried to blackmail you or he just wanted out? Making up another one of your stories? I think you killed Jared. And Stacy, she just came home at the wrong time. - Uh-uh. I didn't commit no murders, lady. - Lately? Lady. I said lady. It's all gonna start to unravel, Aaron, you know that. First your crew rolls you on the steroids, then they finger you on the murders of Stacy and Jared Cooper? It's just a matter of time. If I give you a hot tip, like a really smoking hot piece of social media information, maybe you and I could do a deal. - I don't deal with murderers. - That's the thing. I didn't do these things that you accuse me of... but I might know someone who knows someone who did. - I'm gonna need more than that. - What's my deal? Plead to the drug charge, I recommend 2 years less a day. Nope. Conditional discharge probation. I get to throw you back in for hard time if you lie to me or misbehave. Misbehave? Mmm! You going all hot schoolteacher on me now? You got 10 seconds. You're looking for Clover, right? - Stacy's friend? - I know where you can find her. - And how would that help me? - 'Cause she asked me to protect her. Protect her from who? Somebody trying to kill her. - How's your plumbing problem? - What? Twisted something? All good, no leaks? Was it your back, your shoulder? - Who is it? - Aaron Dixon sent us. Clover? You need to come with us. Yeah. Yeah. Stacy and me, we... we met when we were both ring girls. This one day at an event, they tell us they want us to wear just body paint, nothing else. That was that. I decided to train myself, took up women's boxing. But Stacy and me, we stayed friends. How would you describe Jared and Stacy's relationship? Uh, good. I guess. You guess? They were... Stacy had to manage more than Jared's career, you know, he... He was pretty up and down. Aaron Dixon told us that you needed protection. I guess, yeah. From who? Clover, two people have been murdered. You need to tell me what's going on. Jared was nice. I mean scary, right, in the cage, but... sweet. You and Jared were sleeping together? Yeah. - When was the last time you saw him? - A few days ago. And Stacy was your best friend? Yeah. Clover, do you know who killed Jared and Stacy? Little Billy. He found out about me and Jared. He got pretty pissed off. He said he was gonna lay some hurt down on him. He was gonna kill him. Are you afraid he's gonna hurt you? He said he was gonna kill me. William Ridge, otherwise known as Little Billy, MMA trainer at the dog pound. You know him? - We sparred a few times. He's got a pretty long sheet: Sale of cocaine, ss a bad temper. There's an old restraining order: he assaulted a pregnant girlfriend 3 years ago. - And you got to hit him. - If I knew about this, I would've hit him harder. Where's Clover now? Protective custody. You think Little Billy could've done it? - Yeah. You? - With a name like Little Billy, he's gotta be guilty of something. So how did he do it? Were Little Billy and Jared even friends? They sparred once in a while. Not sure if they ever hung out. - Billy would've had to have gone over to Jared's house. - Steroids. - What about them? - Little Billy deals them out of the club for Dixon. - Jared was juiced. - Little Billy made a home delivery. - That would get him inside. - And Jerry wouldn't see it coming. OK, let's go with that. Spears, get back over to the dog pound to see... Hang on. Danny. Yeah? We didn't find any steroids at Jared's house. She what? I know, but I... Jared built stash boxes for everyone else; Maybe Jared built a stash box for himself. I'm on my way down. No, yeah. I think I know who it is. You guys head back over to the house and see if you can find where Jared stashed his little green pills. Spears, we got trace DNA on the unused bullets and the gun. See if you can convince Billy to give us a sample. I gotta... head downstairs and deal with an interesting crazy lady. You threw rocks at another car. No, another car almost ran me over. Cause and effect. - I went to bat for you. - I didn't ask you to. - So you do want to go to jail. - No. Then why? You need to stop, Margie. Maybe I wanted to get to know you better. - You have my card, you could have called. - I was just kidding. - Let me get a lawyer for you. - I got smarts, I got money for my own bail. What about you? What? You got a way to bail yourself out? - I'm not... - Maybe you should. Wow, I'm really confused. What are we talking about here? - Do you really wanna know? - Yes, please. - You. You need to breathe. Should we step into my office? (electronic signal) Thanks. - Every fighter needs his bag of frozen peas, right? - Mm-hmm? Ice cubes to make your shakes. Freezer's broken. OK, so those are steroids. But how do we know Little Billy delivered them the night of the murder? Dixon said there was a brand new shipment. Billy must've delivered them that night. Billy! Detective sergeant Spears. I need to ask you a few more questions. - You wanna talk, step in the cage. - Let's go, get out. What you gonna do, shoot me? You're a person of interest in a murder case. Let's go. You step up, and I answer every question and talk as long as you want. You don't, I lawyer up and you never get the answers you're looking for. You want something from me, huh? Come and get it. There are easier ways to get a suspect's DNA, but... they're not as much fun. (rap music) Should we let him shower before we bring him in? (panting) Yeah, really appreciate you cooperating with us to help us nail down the guy who killed Jared and Stacy Cooper. So you know who it was, huh? - How well do you know Aaron Dixon? - I see him at the club. - Yeah, we think Dixon did the murders. - Nothing surprises me. Dixon, he's trying to box you in for the murders. Yeah, I know. He sent us to, uh... Clover Harcourt? And she said that you and her had a thing... Clover? Never nothing serious. We're both... free agents. Hmm. I just gotta tie up a few loose ends here. (She clears her throat.) So we got this sworn statement from Clover and she says you made death threats? I say some things in the moment, you know how you do. Uh... Clover also said that you made death threats to Jared Cooper? Yeah, well... So you did. And we know that you gave Jared Cooper steroids acquired from Dixon. We know that. Your man Spears tell you that? I mean, he would know. I sold him some, too. And you dropped the steroids off to Jared the night he and Stacy were killed. My job is hard. Murderers getting smarter all the time, no witnesses, doing a really clean job of cleaning the murder weapon... It's almost like we got nothing to go on. But... you'd be surprised how many smart murderers forget to wear gloves when they load their guns. And DNA on bullets, that's a lot to go on. I'm thinking we're gonna find your DNA on those bullets, Billy. And we've got your DNA on Detective sergeant Spears, in your blood from the fight. I'd say today's a pretty good day. You think I need this? Seriously, do you think I need this? Sir, I really... King, did you know that Spears had a relationship with this Little Billy? - It wasn't relevant, sir. - It is now. You've charged him with murder. Spears, I'm going to ask you once, did you buy steroids or any controlled or illegal substance from that man? - No. - And you'll testify under oath to that fact? - Yes, sir. - And that testimony will be truthful? - Chief, you've asked him more than once. - Yes, sir. Billy is lying, sir. - And your case is solid? - Planned and deliberate. First degree times two. Then you bury him, I need some good press. Get the hell out of here. - Jess... - You better not. (Ding! ) That was such a case... What are you going to do? Good night, girls, see you next week. (girls giggling) Ah, there she is. Hi. This is very unprofessional. I'm just a piano player, Your Honour. You should put your hair up. I should cut it all off. No, you shouldn't! I haven't done this since... well... maybe ten. Well, sometimes you need to go back to go forward. (steps approaching) Ah, David, this is Jessica King. The Detective. - Hi. - Hi. Yeah, don't get your hopes up, he just got married. - Congratulations. - Thanks. And he and Fraser are gonna be very happy as soon as Fraser gets off his fat arse and gets a job. Okay, Margie, we should... - Yes, okay, fine. - Would you like to begin? Yeah. Um, you tell anyone who I am and what I do, I'll shoot you. Okay? Seriously. ♪ (police siren) you might even laugh from it. You will say that something so strange is impossible. But this is certainly my mother's story. was a wolf-man. My mother was a student in a national university on the outskirts of Tokyo. Her scholarship covered her school fees. And for her living expenses she had a part-time job at the same time. but also on miscellaneous subjects. they had no knowledge about Areté. my mom saw my father for the first time. taking notes without a textbook on nothing but a notebook. She thought he was very different from the other students. Please wait. This is the attendance ticket. If you don't sign and turn it in you won't be marked present. So... I'm... Not a student here. What? I won't be coming again. Who's that? Please wait. but at that lecture you didn't have a textbook so I thought it would be a bit hard to study. Why don't we share mine? Welcome. It will be done by Friday. Thank you for your patronage. Sorry for the wait. Welcome. Let's be careful with this. this way. Where should I place this? here. Come in. come. and the sophist Lycon. but Anytus was the one behind the prosecution. What do you do for fun? What kind of food do you like? What kind of person do you love? Why are you called "Hana"? My name? Yeah. When I was born the cosmos flowers in the backyard were blooming. they were blooming naturally. When my father saw them he immediately thought: that won't fade away. then we'll be able to overcome almost anything. I was smiling the whole time. My relatives were all thinking "What an indiscretion". That made me really angry. But... Maybe that was an indiscretion after all... it wasn't. I'm glad. but each one is different inside. and homes with only elders. It would be nice to have a home. Saying "I'm home" when you arrive. and sit yourself comfortably on a chair. That would be great. I would build a shelf. Fill it with books and then build another shelf. your own home. And I'll say "Welcome home" when you arrive. Hana... What? There's something I must tell you... Speak your mind. The truth is... Let's do this again tomorrow. Okay. Hana... Hana. I messed up. It's something I never told anyone before. because you might leave me. I should have told you sooner. I should have shown you. Shown me? Could you close your eyes for a moment? A bit longer. Can I open them? Hana... What do I look like? and attacking people was known as just a legend. The world is full of things unknown to me. that's probably what my mother thought. Did I shock you? Should we stop meeting? But you're trembling. Are you scared? I'm not. Because it's you. that went extinct about a hundred years ago. The last being that inherited a blood mix of humans and wolves. the history of their family's destruction. and died after. faced many troubles and grew up into an adult. He got a driver's license and moved to the city to look for a job. and had no one to look back on. Until that point he had taken care to live in secret and in hiding. That's what my father said. Gentle to Heart and Body Natural Birth Mom gave birth to me in that small apartment. It was a snowy day. only by themselves... the doctors would be shocked. I'm glad she was born safely. But things are just starting now. Will she grow to be a gentle child? She will probably be a very smart kid. I wonder what kind of adult she'll be. I want her to work on whatever she likes. to become a happy and healthy child. We'll watch over her until she grows up. Yeah. My little brother was born in the spring of the following year. It was a rainy day. my father had disappeared. I don't know... what my father was thinking that day. It was probably the instinct of hunting food for the baby at work. something nutritious to eat. [TN: That's a driving license] I leave the children in your care. My mother heard it like he said that. Leave it to me. I'll raise them well. After that I don't remember my mother ever thinking about anything serious. Rice! Yuki. Rice! Just a bit more. Rice! Yuki! She said that whenever I got angry and grumbled my fur would grow out and I would turn into a wolf. I guess it can't be helped. Have a biscuit before lunch. crying out and searching for food from morning until night. I was very different from my brother who ate little and was weak. My mother took a suspension from college to raise us. She also had to quit her part time job. That was close. The small savings my father left us were enough to sustain our living. That was close. she was wondering whether to have us live as humans or wolves. She was at a loss over it. Oh my. so she had to study everything by herself in books. she had to breastfeed for two whole hours. Whenever her breast didn't produce milk she used skim milk instead. Living with Wolves she stayed up all night holding him and caressing his back. Because of that my mother would always be dozing off once in a while. It's alright. even if she just closed her eyes for a short moment. Mommy. What? The problem was when we got sick. Yuki? Yuki? Yuki! She was conflicted between going to the pediatrics or the vets... My child ended up eating drying agent by mistake. She is two years old. she vomited. There was no blood in it. It has "Silica Gel" written on it. But... Are there any complications? Huh? Her appetite? I'm hungry. I see... It's alright... My mother regrets never asking how my father was raised when he was a kid. Walk. that's... Walk! You've been in bad health the past few days. So we... WALK! I get it. Gee... hide your ears. let's go for a walk. But watch your ears! They are showing again! Okay! Good afternoon. How cute. he called you cute. S- sorry. No... But that wasn't the only problem. What time do you think it is? Stop with the noise! I'm so sorry. for crying out loud! I'm truly sorry for this. Teach them some discipline! there. It's alright. It's written in the lease that pets are prohibited in the apartment. We don't have any. Don't lie. We'll find out about it. you're more than welcome to go someplace else you prefer. From the child consultation center? the neighbors are worried the children are in peril. What do you mean? Our research shows your children never had a medical checkup did they? It's alright. They are healthy. we would at least like to take a look at them. that's... It's just for a second. It is just to confirm what you are saying is true. T- that's not possible. we'll have no choice but to suspect you of ill-treatment and neglect. Please go away! Slooow! Hey. mom? What do you want from now on? or wolves? to someplace you can choose whatever you want. We'll start with the vacant houses by the town hall. but they don't stay long. there isn't much around here. it's a two and a half hour one-way bus and train ride. A round trip is five hours! Even if you say you want to raise your kids in a good environment... I'd say the city is a much more convenient place. It's huge... the price for repairs would be insane. Since it's an abandoned house... it's okay to keep your shoes on. This place is practically dilapidated. But at least the electricity still works. And the stream water hasn't dried up. And the things from the shed are also okay to use. right? this place is not suited for self-sufficiency. Animals come down from the mountain and damage the fields. they'd just eat them all. The houses in this area became empty because the humans around here were driven out by them. So the neighborhood? Neighborhood? No one ever comes down so you won't see them. Would you like to see someplace else? Around the village would be more practical... I'll take it. What? I'm taking this house. Why? Where are we? Our new house. It's slanting! ants! What is this? ! Step! Step! Help! So? Do you guys like it? I like it! Let's go back. She wanted someplace where there was nobody living around. She was a bit eccentric. And her husband? Who knows. Any income? Who knows. So how does she plan on providing for her and her children? Gramps Nirasaki! Please be gentle on them this time! 3... 2... look! Come down. Come down. Here. come. Here. Age 4 Age 5 Thank you very much. Come again. Good evening. Good evening. come here. Is that the woman from the rumors? From now on I'll have to start saving as much as possible. S-a-v-i-n-g? That means we will have to do things like planting our own vegetables. too! okay? Okay. I'll take these. Sure. Those too. Yuki! Yuki and Ame being wolf children is our little secret. Yeah. everyone would be shocked. That's why they could never turn into wolves in front of other people. Right? It's our promise. Got it. One more thing. don't be arrogant with them. Why? Because that would make you father sad. Right? You get it? We get it! We won't forgive you!" said the very angry villagers as they chased the wolf with their guns. I'm sorry! I won't do it anymore" cried the boasting wolf while running away. Why? Why indeed? Hey! Excuse me. Huh? May I take the fallen leaves from the woods? What? The fallen leaves. You don't have to ask anybody to take those. Thank you very much. How long will she keep it up? She has been quite the talk around the convenience store and the karaoke place. I don't doubt it. This time for sure. Mom... Ame! What happened? A tortoiseshell cat. it had its eyes on him since he's weak. Those are just scratches. They are nothing You won't survive with those! Yuki. Will you comfort me? You will be alright. You sure will. not even for a boar! You saw a boar? I did! I also saw a monkey and a wild goat. But I wasn't scared at all! It was fun when I started chasing them and they ran away! Also- Yuki. when I peed... you can't be self-important around other animals. But... Please. Okaaay. Thank you. Can you comfort me again? it's fine. But surely... How does a wolf child become an adult? Yuki! Wait. Pick me up. Already? You're slow. Hurry up! Wolves start hunting only four months after they are born. First they start with small game like rats. they team up with adult wolves and... TEAM! No way... I didn't want to anyway. Don't go too far away. Sure. let's go back? Ame. Do you think we can eat this plant? Hm... Got it! Caught it! look Ame. It's alright. It will be fine. look! It's a great cormorant. There's a stream on the other side and... Mom... Why are wolves always the bad guys? Is it because... of that picture book? Everyone hates him and he gets killed at the end. That's why I... I hate being a wolf. I see. But... Your mother loves wolves. even if just by herself. Moom. Mooom. What happened? They are withering again. A disease? In all of them? No way... Mom. What's going to happen to us now? It's no use. Your mother still has to study much more. Will you help me again? I will. Thank you. Get inside. Sure. Good evening. but with all the commotion... right? Even though I did everything in the books it just ends up failing. isn't it? Full of nature. What's so natural? will it? it's always the same. Isn't that what you were thinking? T- that's... Don't smile. Why are you smiling? Smiling won't do anything about it. That man is scary. No. I don't know how to do this and I'm hopeless. Even though you're an adult? I regret not asking your father about more various things. This is bad. So bad. Good afternoon. Um.... Here. This is to you. What is it? Seed potato. And you plant these in the fields? You can use it to do many more things. but don't worry. That's just his personality. that was my fault. Good afternoon! I'm sorry. It's alright. Here. Old man Nirasaki. Thank you for the seed potatoes. Do you plan to let them go to waste? Start over from the earth. You can't dig like that. I'm sorry. Er... What about fertilizers? Did you bury the dry leaves there? Yes. Then you don't need it. work the soil up here too. It doesn't need to go that far. It's just for me and my two children to eat. Didn't you hear me? I did. Create the rows. Yes. Leave more space between them. Yes. make them higher. Yes. plant the cut part facing down. just leave them. Um... Thanks for teaching me so much... are you okay? Good afternoon. Come here. Huh? just come here. Hm? come on. you. Yes? Those are chamomile and cabbage. it will make a taste bugs don't like. don't! Celery is much better with cabbage. Not it isn't. For beginners this is better. no. Is chamomile even gonna fill anyone's stomach? not deep. You're wrong. You first need to soak the hole with water. no. you need to plant first. wrong. You can sprinkle the fertilizer this way. If you add too much the insects will flock here. No. Give me that. Be more daring with it. Wrong. You need to add just a bit. You will definitely go wrong if you follow his advice. That's your advice! What? Vinegar wood polish? It's made from charcoal-roasted smoke. Then then treated poultry manure is added to it. Thanks for everything. thank you. Sorry for intruding so inadvertently and surprising you. no. It must have been hard to work a land so raw. so I had to study everyday. but they always gave up and went back soon after. Were there others as young as me? they were old men who had retired. It's funny how mental and weak they were. this is no land that makes living off it easy. The drainage is bad. There's a ton of snow. We have to help each other. We thought you weren't one to socialize with your neighbors. There aren't many young mothers around here. So it's really reassuring to have one more of us here. Ask anything you want. then... What? You live off your savings? ! but they will soon run out. It's hard to find a job. Everyone leaves their children at the nursery school and goes far away to work. What kind of place is a "nursery school"? Why don't Yuki and Ame go there? That's because... Yuki wants to go to the nursery school! No way. I will go! No way! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will... I'LL GO! I want to! I want to! I want to! I want to! hurry up and eat your food. I know it's about our secret. But I'll be careful. But you see... I'll be careful. Y - Yuki... do you own a dog? err... Well... Isn't that a wolf? darling! It's a wolf! that's not... there are no more wolves in Japan. That's a shepherd mix. Hana-chan? Ain't I right? ain't I? What? The dog is gone. good afternoon. Yuki-chan. Aren't you sociable today? Your clothes are just like your dog's. Isn't she cute? Y - Yuki... Hana-chan? Hello! Hello! I wonder where grandpa Nirasaki is... They were grown quite nicely. It's thanks to everyone's help. so this will be very helpful. What do you mean damaged? A boar. take these. This much! ? Those boars... I'll thankfully accept these. he dug everything up. It seems that this year he even went as far as going to Sakei's rice field. this is in exchange. It's heavy. Hana-chan's field was the only one that the animals didn't damage. That's a miracle on this mountain. Maybe there's a trick to it? I didn't do anything. We would all like to hear it. What does "trick" mean? Pee! that Yuki-chan. By any chance... What? No... It's nothing. Thank you very much. It's okay. It's in exchange for the potatoes. It has been a long time since we had any eggs. That's good to hear. Tell me if you run out of them. Oh. That's SO cute. Huh? Huh? But that's so big. I can't take it. It's alright. Don't mention it. It's from a guy who had it sitting in his shed. but... Take it. Besides if we take it back the old man would be angry at us. Old man"? it's getting old. He is totally in love with you. He's over 90. he gets everyone involved... You idiot! You shouldn't be saying things like that. So that's it... I finally understand the reason why the field had to be bigger. I don't like it. Huh? Why are you always smiling like that? Don't laugh! What's so funny about it? Even though I moved here to escape from people's eyes... I ended up getting a lot of help from everyone at the village. but somehow it seems like I can keep on going. Cool! M- mo- mom! Ame! Ame is-! M- mom! Ame! Ame! Ame! Ame! M- o- mom... Ame! Mom... Ame... Ame! Ame! Ame! Open your eyes! Ame! Ame! Ame! Open your eyes... Ame... Mom... It hurts... Ame! I found a crested kingfisher. It was a really beautiful crested kingfisher. Today even I felt like catching one myself. You know what? It was totally different from before. I wasn't scared. I felt like I could do anything for a moment there. And then... Why are you crying? What are we doing here? Later my mother said that she had never been so scared in her life. turned into someone completely different. it was inevitable. I started following every single order to the full extent. I could go. However... No matter what happens... I won't become a wolf! I know that already. It's a promise. I can manage it. three octopuses". What's that? It's a good luck charm so you don't become a wolf. Good luck charm? three octopuses". Three.. three octopuses. three octopuses". three octopuses". three octopuses". Hurry up! three octopuses". three octopuses". three octopuses". It was the first time in my life I was surrounded by so many people. when I got there I was unsure if I could actually do it. But that was only at the start. I'm leaving. See you! take care. Yeah. Shino-chan! Good morning. Yuki-chan. I saved you your seat. Thank you. First Grade who knows the answer to this? Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! no running! Yuki-chan! do your best! You're fast. Amazing Yuki-chan. Only you could do that! Thank you very much. Good luck. Thanks for waiting. Job offers – Part-time That is... The nature observatory of the Niikawa's forest is looking for an assistant researcher. Historic village's nature Sorry to keep you waiting. Shall we go? Tendo. Welcome to Niikawa's forest nature observatory. Thanks for welcoming us here. and preserve the wild life. These three pillars are what we ask of volunteers while they're here. a specialist must be simultaneously proficient in all of them. we are taking applications for an assistant to the busy nature observers. That is indeed the case. though. but the study required for that and training expenses are the only implications. The hourly wage of a part-time high school student is best suited for you. Even so... Do you want the job? Er... I heard you keep a wolf here... It's a timber wolf. He is quiet. It's because of his age. could you... Excuse me for a moment. Nice to meet you. I came here because there's something I'd like to ask you. This boy is the son of a wolf. His wolf father passed away. but I don't know how to raise a wolf child. What did you do to become an adult wolf? Won't you tell me about the time you were raised in the woods? sorry about that. A wealthy person got special permission to acquire and raise him. so they brought him to us. Although he was originally born at a zoo in Moscow. He isn't a wild animal? It's rare to see wild wolves at zoos. it's taken as a foster child. we take in hurt wild birds and raccoon dogs. After that we deal with healing them. but will you be okay doing it with me? about the mountains and nature. That's the first time I saw a real one. A wolf? Was dad like that? No. Not at all. Good. Why? Because that guy looked very lonely. I wanted to meet my dad. too. I underwent a big impact. yours looks great. Keno-chan. I found a four-leafed clover. Me too! Yuki-chan! Did you find anything? Yeah. Look! Just for fun I caught a rat snake and wrapped it around my arm but there were no girls like me in school. this is my mother's jewelry. So pretty! She got this one on her last birthday. How nice. show us your treasure chest! Sure! what is inside? Look. There were no other girls who would happily gather small animal bones and reptile dry skins besides me. I realized. I was so embarrassed that it got me anxious. I reached a decision: From now on I would act as graceful and girly as I could. Don't laugh! I'm troubled with all seriousness! Yuki. I don't want people to think I'm a weirdo. I guess I'll have to help you. I remember I got really happy that my mother started sewing a new dress just for me. Because of this I stopped feeling out of place in the middle of the class. I started getting along much better with my friends. Good morning! Morning! Yuki-chan! They're wonderful! I say that this dress saved me. Next year it was really hard to get Ame to go to school. You hear? three octopuses". The school is this way! first graders! second graders! first graders! second graders! second graders! third graders. third graders! fourth graders! third graders! Good morning. Ame-kun. Is today a holiday at school? No. So you're ditching? Yeah. You can come here whenever you want. Sorry for the inconvenience. This is the research center. Here you can also see a Mountain Frog that has a tail. Hana-chan! Can you help us here? Suure! your attention. Let me introduce you the new exchange student. His name is Fujii Souhei-kun. introduce yourself. I'm Fujii. It's nice to meet you. too. do you have a pet dog? Huh? Why? you smell like a furry animal. I don't have one. Really? That's weird. I was pretty sure you did. What is it? no. It's just this smell. A smell? Of what? Maybe it's just my imagination. Which is it... it's this one! are you serious? Yuki-chan. too. Souhei-kun is really funny. I have to return this book. What's up with her? She not always like that. Hey Yuki. About that... about that... Hey Yuki! Yuki! Hey Yuki! Be honest with me! What? Did I do something to you? No you didn't. So you don't like me because I'm an exchange student? Is that it? I told you it's not that. Then why are you avoiding me? I'm not. three octopus. three octopus. Three.. Hey! Wait up! three octopuses. three octopuses. three octopuses. three octopuses. Get away! Hey you. Don't get any closer! What are you doing? ! Don't touch me! Yuki! Yuki! Hana-chan. Telephone. Thanks. Hello. I'm sorry to call you in the middle of work. Do you know how much blood he lost from his head? It was just my ear. Yuki. No matter what I ask her she doesn't say a word. Did you really hurt him? Did you apologize to him? Apologize. Apologize right now. I'm sorry. I have no excuse for what happened. Souhei-kun's mother so... And what if it had drained all the blood from my son's head? And what if by some chance he becomes deaf in that ear? What a child does is a parent's responsibility! Does taking out a loan or selling your house make up for that? ! so... And what makes you think that's the case? If you don't listen I'll have to... A wolf. It was a wolf that did it. It was a wolf that did this. Souhei. What are you talking about? Souhei... Souhei? They didn't catch the culprit. she has been different lately. Yuki-chan would never do that. It's obvious that it was her. So the teacher... What happened with Souhei-kun? He left early. How come? Because he got hurt. How did he get hurt? you see... Who hurt him? Well... Yuki-chan! Yuki-chan. I knew it. Was it really her? I'm a detective. Stop that! Quiet down! Everyone quiet down! It didn't work... The good luck charm; no matter how many times I repeated it. They... should expel me already. Will we be unable to live at that house anymore? I'm sorry... I'm sorry! Mom... I'm sorry! there. Souhei-kun? A printed paper. From Souhei-kun. From Souhei-kun. Souhei-kun. Today she went to play at Shino-chan's house. I see. Wait a minute. You must live pretty far away. Thanks for coming here everyday. I don't like that Yuki is not going to school anymore. didn't you? What did you mean by it? That was... I mean.. but... For a moment there I'm pretty sure I saw a wolf. it hurt me. That's why I said that a wolf did it. Which means it wasn't Yuki's fault. But everyone says I'm talking nonsense with that... I see... Can I ask you one more question? Do you hate wolves? Not really. Neither do I. Hey... Wanna see it? Isn't it cool? Want to touch it? Doesn't it hurt? Itches a bit. Let's go! I'm going. Where are you going? To my teacher's home. Who is your teacher? My teacher is... My teacher. I get it. Will you be okay on your own? Yeah. Take care. Sure. Don't stay out late. Sure. Where's Yuki-chan? She went back to school today. That's great. What about Ame-chan? some times not. That's also good for him. Guys who don't go to school since elementary school are very promising. Edison and I were like that. Now he is talking nonsense again. who lives up in the mountain? The mountain? I thought he meant the old man but... Let me see. Is there anyone on the mountain during this busy farming season? My teacher knows everything. Everything about the mountain. I never thought you would get along with older people... Next time bring him here. besides... My teacher doesn't meet with humans. He doesn't go down to the village like the bears and boars. But I guess he might like to meet my mother. My teacher is the master in charge of this whole mountain's territory. Thanks for always taking care of Ame. You can get in now. I want to bring Yuki to my teacher's place too. I'm improving my hunting technique. There's a trick to run at full speed in the forest. There's also a way to read the terrain. I've been studying a lot. also about territory and how to respect them. There's no way I'm going. Why? And why don't you go to school anymore? Because the mountain is much more fun. There are many things I still have to learn there. It's better not to learn those. Why? Just start going to school! No way. Why not? Because I'm a wolf. You're human. We're wolves. I decided I'm never turning into a wolf again. Why? How come? Because I'm human! Okay? I'm HUMAN! Why do you say that? why". you're a wolf. you... Shut up! You don't know anything! What? ! I'll never forgive you if you don't come to school tomorrow. I won't go! Then I won't forgive you! And I won't go! You wanna fight? What? What's that noise? Yuki! Ame! Stop it you two! Yuki! Ame! Yuki! Ame! Ame? Both Yuki and Ame started walking on their separate paths. why do I feel this uneasy? why? was full of many record-setting heavy rains. Ame started going to the mountain more frequently. would affect his teacher and the mountain flora and fauna. He seemed very worried about that. Ame! Where have you been all this time? You're cold. I'll warm up the bath for you. My teacher... Hurt his leg and can't walk anymore. He... might die soon. Someone has to take the place of my teacher and carry on his duties. Ame! Don't go to the mountain anymore. Okay? You're still only 10. You're just a kid. you're... Please. Don't go to the mountain anymore. It's your mom's... wish... I'm going now. I'm going now. Hey! Shoot it in! shoot it! pass! do you know? Know what? I overheard my parents talking about it... Yeah? Souhei-kun's mother... She is getting married. Really! ? How come? Because she is beautiful! Then Souhei-kun will get a new father. That's great. they said. Really? Why? Why? Really? Yes. This is our secret. Alright! It got in! Yay! What's the score now? No way! shoot... Good morning. but from the evening to late tonight a strong rain is forecast.. It's humid today. Yuki. Stay home today. Stay with mom. Why? At least spoke to Vicki last night, at least you two like, you're going to like, gunna be? Yeah. Vicki is just, she's a proper twat, she's an idiot. It's a little bit like the conflict between Bobby and Cindy. Bobby fuckin' hates Cindy. Malibu Mandy's trying to sort it out, she's like Bobby listen, I think if we talk to Cindy, you're gunna like her. Why don't we just let her come in the pink jeep and we'll all cruise down the beach together? [Phone rings] Hello? Hi, good morning, It's Anna. Yes. I've got a client today, who needs spray tan. It's going to be Jay, Becca, Ricci and Charlotte going to graft today. So, they're going to have the hangover shakes, and whoever the spray tanning is goin to look like they've got some sort of skin disease. I don't want to leave, and go party. And, we've got to go get ready immediately! Ugh, God! What a surprise! Who's at work? Oh, the girl who feels down, let's all just pick on her. [Music] How could he get back on it now, couldn't ya? How could you be thinking about a drink after last night? I feel really sorry for Charlotte, she's so down in the dumps. Gary's just fucked her in the head completely. [Music] Hi everyone! You're a sprayer, you settle right? What you doing? You, he puts the Vaseline on. I make sure everything's running smoothly. I feel sick at how he's doing this again. This is the last time I let Gary break me heart. Is there any more wine? Give me some of yours. Fuckin can't believe Charlotte gets fucking pissed because of Gary. Pretty much only three things left that can happen; let go of the relationship, carry on the way they are, or end it. And, for me the best thing to do is just end it. Oh shit. What's just happened there? [Music] New Castle has such a great nightlife. Everyone just wants to go out and get smashed, every single night. So, no matter what night you go out, it's going to be good. We're back in New Castle, which means, lashes, hair extensions, makeup, decent dresses, tash on, let's get mortal! [Shouting in unison] Gan On! Gan On! [Music] Vicki's got a boyfriend, but it's not him that I'm worried about, but I don't want any bad feelings between me and Jay. So, I prefer to clear before diving in there with Vicki. I respect the fact that he's come up to us, but, just be careful because you could just spend this next six weeks arguing your time, and cock block ya. I think she's gorgeous and she's a lovely person as well. I think me and her could work, if we got together. [Music] I'm a bit pissed, but Gary's thinking with his dick again. It's a brain of it's own. Charlotte's mortal again, she has no filter, she doesn't know when to stop. If I'm out, and you're in the middle of graffing some bird, if someone comes and interrupts me half way through that, saying come look at Charlotte. Like two seconds - I'll be back in ten minutes, I'm just going to look after this person, I've been bangin, who I don't really like, but do you know what I mean? I couldn't pull it, I couldn't go home with her because you're too pissed, so I'm cock-blocked both ways. Charlotte mortal again. Getting really upset, I feel really sorry for the girls, because they constantly have to look after her. You can't blame guys all the time, it's not evidence and twins. What's that sound? I believe that's reasonable doubt starting its engines. We have evidence that the same pry bar was used to sabotage tripp's motorcycle. A common tool left in a semi-public area in a situation that could have resulted from incompetence rather than sabotage. You sabotaged the bike to kill tripp,but he signed the contract before he could ride the bike and die the way he was supposed to. So,you killed him with the pry bar,loaded him onto his own truck and dumped him in the mud puddle. Everything was great until your brother rode the bike that you sabotaged. You don't ride someone else's bike. Danny knew that. Philippa. You killed him accidentally,but you did kill him. I loved my brother. I... don't speak,please. Are we free to go,or would you like to waste some more of the taxpayers' money? She did it. You may get a prosecutor to lay a murder charge, but a jury will never bring home this baby the way you want it to. You're right. But you know what? I'm still going to make the arrest. To what end? You can't win. To let everybody knows what philippa did,including her father. I'm okay with what you did there. Yeah,thanks a million,bones. Don't get mad. I'm just saying that I just like it better when we catch them and they go to jail. Yeah,well,sometimes it can get messy,bones,but the point is,it gets done. This one started out in a pit of mud and ended in a pit of mud. that's very damn poetic of you. Oh,hey,guys. I didn't know you'd be here. what do you think,bones? He's lying. You want to sit down? Not really. Lying again. Come on,sit down. Okay. april dump you? How do you know that? He's got that dumpee look on his face. I'm a trained psychologist. I mean,I saw this coming. It's not like the signs eluded me. So,I prepared myself mentally for it... hey,sweets,bones and I-- we're going bowling tonight. Yes. Yes. Bowling. You know what? You want to come? To go bowling with us at the bowling rink? Alley. Bowling alley. The bowling alley. You know,fish aren't actually sentient. There's a reason people say "cold as a fish." Me? I'm a dog person. I think that has meaning,don't you? Sure. You think april was pretty? Not at all. You're lying,dr. Brennan. I appreciate the effort. Thank you. Come on,sweets. What do you say we go bowling? I got him. Come on. - No,it's all right. - Come on. The GPS says it's right up here. - You don't even know how to use that thing. - The hell I don't. We're here. We just drove an hour through the woods to find more woods that look just like the woods we drove through. - Eureka. - Ew. That's mud. No. This is like, um... - It's pretty much mud. - Smells like rotten eggs. Mm, sulphur. Very therapeutic. And you expect me to believe you've never been here before? A friend of mine told me about this and swore me to secrecy. This is my first time. In mud. Come on in. It's nice. All right. Mm. Something's poking me. This mud is reputed to have amazing romantic properties. Mm. I think I got it. No, I think I'd notice if you got it. Oh, jeez. This hot spring averages 105 degrees, but it can spike to near boiling, so we discourage bathers. Especially those who illegally drive 4x4 vehicles into a national park. - So someone was boiled to death? - Or had a heart attack or passed out. The flesh will have to be macerated. - What's that? - Don't ask. The flesh either has to be boiled off or eaten by dermestid beetles. Can't you just say "cleaned"? Sulphur encrusted the bone. See the staining? - So it's been there a long time? - No. - Why bring it up, then? - Signs of blunt-force trauma. - What's that mean? - He didn't boil to death on his own. - I'm going to need all the mud. - Excuse me? Get a tanker truck out here and suck it up so we can filter it at the Jeffersonian. Humerus is 36.5cm. Medium build. Late 20s, early 30s. He's broken this bone before. - Is she serious about the mud? - Serious as a gas attack. Heart attack, Bones. Serious as a heart attack. Description's too general to try a missing persons report. Triangular depression in the calvarium, anterior longitudinal one fracture, grazed cortical bone in C1. - There's a patterned impression in the bone. - How many times was he hit and by what? More than once by a... square pipe? Does that exist? People hit people with anything they can swing. He was attacked from behind? - Mm... - What? There's a vertical impaction fracture to his glabella and frontonasal suture. - Same weapon? - It doesn't appear so. - I've seen this before. - Great. Where? From sharpened stone weapons in "Neandertal" skeletons. I'm thinking, "Not so relevant." A blow to the front of the head would cause a severe laceration. - No bloodstains around the mud bath. - So the body was dumped post mortem. About the Neanderthals... - "Neandertals". - What was the context of those killings? Accepted scenarios indicate a single individual attacked by two or more assailants. Then we're looking for two or more murderers. - No time of death yet. - It was definitely a murder. - Probably two assailants. - What a shock for that couple. They slide naked into the hot mud bath, and a skeleton pokes her in the... - Anus. - Bones! - It's a clinical term for that part of the body. - Dr Brennan... Agent Booth. Would it be fair to say you use work to avoid confronting personal issues? - Because I won't talk about? - The anus. - You like that word. - Do you discuss anything apart from work? - It's better than talking about... - The anus? - What is it with you two? - Sweets is right. We talk a lot about work. - I talk about my kid. - Almost kidnapped during a case. My father. We talk about him. Because Agent Booth arrested him for murder. What are you trying to get at here? Your inability to share your personal lives. I thought that was obvious. OK, that was snotty. I don't respond well to snotty. After a case, sometimes we have a drink or coffee. Booth has pie. I don't like pie. - You really should just... give it a chance. - I find it too sweet. OK, there. We talked about pie. Nothing to do with work. It is better when we discuss murder. I'd like to see you guys in a social situation where work is a taboo subject. - You gonna send us to a restaurant? - I'm still not having pie. An evening out with my girlfriend and me. - They need someone to buy them beer. - You want a double date? Why don't you go on the internet like all the rest of the kids? If it goes well I'll withdraw my concern. Release you back into your environment. What are we, brook trout? Fine. Agent Booth? Unless you think that's too much to prove. Fine. I'll show him I have nothing to prove. Bring it on, Sweets. So far I have three old beer cans, an Indian arrowhead, 73 cents in change, and a partially melted Sharpie. The victim was braised like osso bucco. Flesh falling off the bone. Time of death between ten days and two weeks. I found stress fractures and degenerative changes in the facet joints. Fits with the hypertrophy of the cervical muscles. I found microscopic tearing, but he had to sustain this position to cause that kind of wear and tear. Death by yoga? - Is that skull ready for me? - You can take it out of the boiler. Or you could do that for me, because I will never, ever do that. There are fractures of the pelvis, fractures of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, multiple metacarpal and metatarsal fractures... What was he, a crash-test dummy? The injuries to the vertebrae, tibia and femur are consistent with landing on the feet after falling from 10 to 20 feet. Like jumping out of a tree? The damage to the scapula and acromion was from a low fall, but forward movement between 16 to 20 miles per hour. - Falling off a bicycle. - These injuries are more recent. Fractured and scored patella and torn retinaculum. Even I didn't get that one. Why would anyone wanna kill him? He was doing a good enough job on his own. Yes, Dr Sweets. I'll ask him. How's Wednesday night? Are you free? To have our big double date with our psychiatrist? One more evening, and maybe we won't have to see him any more. Wednesday's fine. I can't wait. Does he want me to get you a corsage? Wednesday is fine. We'll meet you there. Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting her. OK, bye. This might be fun. His girlfriend works with tropical fish. - Tropical fish? - Yeah. - This is weird. Where are we meeting? - At their ceramics class. - What? No. You're kidding. - Why would I be kidding? He said we need a common activity. Ceramics? I thought the point of therapy was to give us peace of mind, not drive us crazy. Hey, it's Angela. - Hey, Angela. - Hey. I did a rendering of our victim's face. We're checking missing persons. - Wait. That's Tripp Goddard. - Tripp Goddard? The motorcycle racer. I forget sometimes I'm talking to girls. That explains the wrist and neck injuries on Zack's report. Have him confirm with dentals. I don't appreciate the "girls" comment. Uh, Tripp won a huge motorcycle race about two weeks ago. - That fits time of death. - That's the Super Grand Prix in Virginia. Tripp won after some kind of accident took out the frontrunner. - Mm. - Girls, huh? It's not the machine, it's the man. Sure, you need a great bike. But a great rider on a crap bike - still gonna win. Riders say it's the rider, mechanics say the bike. I say it's who signs the checks. - And that would be you. - Yes. And don't forget it. Excuse me. FBI Special Agent Booth. Dr Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian. We're looking for someone who can tell us about Tripp Goddard. Uh, well, I'm Phillipa Fitz, and Tripp rides for our family team, Slam Bolt. - What'd he do? - Who are you? - What does that mean? - Racers, when they lean into the corners, - their knees scrape the asphalt. - Explains his knee injuries. No one has seen Tripp since the Super Grand Prix. Where did he go? After a big win he takes off in his truck, climbs mountains, swims oceans. No one knows for sure. Can I help you? Mr Goddard's dead. What? What happened? We believe he was murdered. Who would kill Tripp? I don't know. Well, the fans loved him. Everybody else hated him. - Get lost, Garth. - Daddy, please. No. I want him out of here, Phillipa. Garth doesn't think Tripp was a good ol' boy. You do. - He's got his reasons. - The wheelchair. - Tripp put him in that chair? - Racing accident a couple of years ago. You can't believe Garth had anything to do with this. I mean, how? With help. - When did you last see Tripp? - Victory party after the race. I saw him get in his truck and leave around midnight. Great. I need the make, the model, the year, license plate of the truck. Anything you need, we're here. Just find the bastard who did this to him. Ha-ha-ha. Yeah. OK, that's Danny Fitz. I would've loved to have decked Tripp after our race, only I was in a coma. - Another Fitz? - Lenny's son, Phillipa's twin brother. Watch this. Danny's got the race in the bag. Final lap, Tripp does that. Classic inside-out block pass. - Is it allowed? - If it's an accident. Slam Bolt were first and second ahead of Flame Spark till Tripp clipped Danny. - There's someone named Flame Spark? - Flame Spark spark plugs. Slam Bolt's rival. I saw a little daylight. Looked like Danny was gonna go wide, so I went for it. It's a bummer when somebody loses the front of their bike like that, but what can you do? - Danny had that race in the bag. - Tripp did the same thing to you, didn't he? Yeah. Well, I guess Tripp didn't learn anything from the time he did that to me. - Danny Fitz, was he at the victory party? - Yeah, absolutely. Brave face for the press. - Did Danny leave before or after Tripp? - About the same time. - How about you? - I took off right after. - Hey. - Hey, hey, hey. - You're good friends with Danny, aren't you? - Good enough friends to kill Tripp together? You know, I'm pretty sure I don't have to say anything without a lawyer. - It's not going to work. - What? Dropping loud pieces of metal to hurry me up. I need the skull to compare tool marks to murder weapons. You're just gonna have to wait. Titanium, magnesium and boron particulates are embedded in these skull fractures. - Mm... - What? That's an exotic combination of metals not found in any of these. It is possible these particulates aren't from the tool. Not the tool alone. - I don't understand. - Racing motorcycles use these metals. The particles could have gone from bicycles to tools to victim. It's not a bicycle. It's a motorcycle. Bicycle. Two wheels. The term applies. Drop those. Drop them. I mean it, Zack. Bombs away. - I don't know what that proves. - Proves I don't handle irritation well. - Can I pick these up now? - No. You can pick one up. The most likely culprit. A narrow instrument, less than an inch, caused the injuries. OK. Strain - the crushing, tearing, shearing - equals the change in dimension divided by the original dimension. I do bugs and slime, I don't do arithmetic. An elongated rod with... this cross-section is the most likely culprit. Good. Good job, Zack. Am I king of the lab? We both are. Let's go tell Cam. Ouch. OK, now that... that's gotta hurt. Wait, here it comes again. Look at that. Oh, watch it. Watch out, watch out. Ooh. Boom. Let the record show Agent Booth is taunting my client, repeatedly showing footage of his traumatic accident. - Accident? Tripp did that to me on purpose. - How fast were you going at the time? - Don't know. I accelerated through 160. - Tripp accelerated faster. See? Whoosh. Again with taunting? - Why was Tripp so much better than you? - Taunting? I'm not taunting, Mr Smalls. I'm restating an objective fact. Tripp had a better bike, 20 horses on me. - You get Tripp's bike now. - I didn't kill Tripp for his bike. - Why did you kill him? - Full stop there, cowboy. Don't sweat it, princess. Any other reason you'd wanna get rid of Tripp? - No. - Danny, certain things you hide make you look guilty. Couple years back, Tripp dated my sister. Cheated on her with a groupie. - Came to blows. - Who won? - I did, for once. Knocked him on his ass. - You defended her honour. Danny and Phillipa are twins, Agent Booth. They're very close. Cheated on your sister, forced you to crash. How would you describe your relationship? We were the best of friends. As your lawyer, I caution you sarcasm doesn't show up in the transcript. Best be avoided. I'm sorry Tripp's dead, but I'm not exactly grieving. You feel me? Bones, he's not afraid of me at all. Hard to scare someone who rides around a track at 200 miles an hour. - Her I like. You wanna go out sometime? - Danny, restrain yourself. - No, she doesn't. - Let me speak for myself. Murder suspect here, Bones. - The wound at the front or the back? - Back. - Couldn't be both? - No. The blow to the front of the head was from a sharp tool. - Sharper than round, blunter than sharp. - What? - That actually made sense. - You spend too much time together. - Can you estimate force? - Back of the head, length undetermined. Width of 3.8cm, approximately a thousand pounds of force. - So a lot. - Half a ton. - Which is a lot. - It isn't much. Now I'm back in a physics class I wanna ditch. - A boxer's fist lands with double that force. - A big fist in a glove. With a force spread out over a lot more than 3.8cm. It wouldn't take much force to crush a skull with this. So we haven't eliminated anyone from our list of suspects. We don't know what that's a cross-section of or what caused the damage to the front of the face. What exactly made you two come in here crowing "king of the lab"? I'm gonna go look at very small things under my very large microscope. I can probably identify the type of tool off this cross-section. Do it and call Booth. See if it's of any use to him. - Boys. - Wow. I don't have the weapon, but I microwaved fabric samples and used gas sensors to... All right, let's just cut to the chase there, OK, Mr Wizard? - I know what was on the victim's clothing. - Fine. I'll take anything. - What is it? - It's toluene. It's a clear liquid used to clean up oil. How is that supposed to help us? Every mechanic uses that. I need a weapon. Do you hear me? A weapon. You know, I'm feeling really underappreciated today. You can suck it up, buttercup. - Booth? - Ah. - Toluene. - It's excellent for cleaning up blood. So if you killed someone here and they bled a lot... The drain. Hey. Check this drain for blood. Blood suspended in toluene might be testable for DNA. - Tell Hodgins he did a good job. - I'll tell Hodgins he did a good job if... I'm waiting. - I hate when you do this. - What? You don't talk. You hate when I talk. It's a double-edged sword. - Bones doesn't mind silence. - Mm-mm. - I hate it. - Why do you think that is? - He gets bored. - You're right. You should see him on stakeouts. He talks and talks. - Well, it's very interesting. - Is it always about work? No. - You're lying. - Oh, come on. How do you know that? I have training in how to tell when people are lying. - Is that true? - See, if you were me, you'd know. You're lying to protect your partner. I understand. But let's agree amongst ourselves that this is a truth zone. - Is something bothering you? - Oh, it's this whole... going-on-a-date thing. It's not a date. It's a social outing for the purpose of professional evaluation. Come on! Ceramics? I'm not that kind of a guy. What do you say we go bowling or to a firing range or climbing a wall? - Right, something you're good at? - A movie? Or dinner. Dinner and movie. - Somewhere I don't have to make something. - Ooh... What? What, "Ooh?" Well, what Sweets would do in this situation is he'd jump on word usage. He'd ask you why you're resistant to making. I "jump on" the semantics? That's a really aggressive turn of phrase. Thanks for pulling focus there, Bones. "Pulling." Is that an aggressive word too? - OK, did you two plan this? - Paranoia. That is paranoia. Since this is a truth zone, I will tell you the truth. We didn't plan anything. - You're telling the truth. - He's guessing. We're going to a ceramics class, and we're all gonna make something. Time's up. Sweets can't tell if someone's lying. He's playing with our minds. An area of study called neurolinguistics proposes that subconscious eye movements and body language tell a well-trained observer if the subject is lying. Yeah, well, I don't believe it. Huh, I don't believe it. - Is that Tripp's bike? - Yeah. Danny's gonna get what he wants. Do me a favour, son. Take it easy couple times around before you blast off. - I know, Dad. Ease into it. - Can I get a picture? Let's get a picture. Number one on the Slam Bolt racing team. That's gotta feel good. - I'm not talking to you without my lawyer. - That goes for all of us. Look, you, you I can replace. Do not wreck my bike. Lenny, I'm thinkin' your boy won't relax into this. Well, Danny gets a chance to grab the brass ring, he's gonna take it. Watch this. He's gonna decelerate before the turn and slingshot right through it. I don't see the deceleration part. No, no... Danny's down! - Move! Let's get in there! - No! No! No! No. - Get in there. - Get that out! No, Daddy. We're at the Belleville practice track, Highway 64. Forever. Aria mit verschiedenen Veranderungen. Goldberg Variations (BWV 988) Variation 1 to 1 Clav.

They returned again in Leipzig to show all the places of Bach and more 'important to this city. The convent and school of St. Thomas were founded in 1212. Therefore the members of the choir are part of a tradition which has nearly 800 years. Initially, Thomas was a small Romanesque church. More 'later, his architecturally choir was enlarged in the Gothic style. In the tower of the church are all architectural styles. The nave of the church Late Gothic and 'dated around 1500.

What's on it? I don't know, Sir. Well, give me that white one. Can I help you? Could I have change for the machine? I think your plants need watering. They're plastic. It's incredible! Would you like some? No thanks. I used to date someone who was allergic. I need a wake-up call tomorrow. At 8:00. Room 314. All set. You must get bored at night sometimes. No, I like it. It's quiet. Here for the conference? The conference? No. I'm a... This is my card. I need it back, it's a prototype. You're a salesman? I see myself as an advisor. Accidents can happen anytime. What do you think? I put a line under my name. It looks good, I guess. I mean, I don't really know much about business cards. There's a mistake. In your name. There are two s's. It says Louise. I don't believe it! You can white it out. They had 2000 printed. How does that insurance stuff work? What do you mean? How do you know what someone's worth? Like me, how much would I be worth if something happened? Such as? I don't know, anything. We'd have to follow the steps, fill out the form. Well, have a good night. Good night. MISSING. REWARD OFFERED. Thank you. Not bad. I'm fine. Thanks. You too. - Hello? - Good morning, This is your wake-up call, Thank you . You sleep OK? Not bad. Do you need anything else? I'm fine. Alright. Hell... Have a... I tell you... Can it be repaired? Made in China. You need little hands... I dunno... It'll be $15 for my time. $10 maybe. Thanks. Yes? Sorry, I must have the wrong address. No, this is the place. Come in. You're the first. Nobody's arrived yet. You can sit in the living room. There's lots of storage space. It's practical. The closets are huge. Would you like to see? Maybe later. What's the tattoo? It's nothing. It's silly, I did it when I was 14. Sort of a pact with my best friend. She did the drawing. What is it? It's the sun. The guy's arm was in a cast. You both have the same? My friend backed out at the last minute. Can I smoke? I'd rather you didn't. I just had the couches cleaned. But you can go on the back balcony. No, that's OK. Are those your kids? That's what their mother tells me. We're not together. Sometimes you think you know someone. But really you don't know them at all. Yeah, I know. I used to date a guy allergic to peanuts. At times I found it hard. Why are we waiting for the others? Can I offer you a drink? A beer, a glass of red wine? Sure. I found a system. I need $400. With $400 I can make the $15,000. I'll pay you back double, maybe more. Come on, Nicole. Don't you think I can beat a machine? I miss you. Can we get together? Alright. Paul? You see... I'm not sure I can come. I have so much to read. We'll celebrate next week. Isa... She's two. Think she'll remember in 20 years we celebrated her birthday late? I'm doing my best. Isa, I... I'm doing everything I can. I never said you had it easy. No, I'm not impatient. I said I'm not impatient. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. No, that's OK. You OK? Yeah, sure. He-'s nice. Thank you. What a relief now that he sleeps through! He looks so much like you! - The eyes. - Just like yours! But he has his father's character. Poor baby's tired. Come here. You must be on cloud nine. How can I describe it? It changes everything. I feel like a real woman now. When he looks at me, it's like, "Don't leave me, I need you!" It's amazing. My God, what happened? OK, we know you're having fun! Mrs. Trudel? Louis Girard from JPL Insurance Plus Group. Yes. How are you? Good. Did you have time to think about our talk yesterday? Look, my role's as an adv... What I'm offering is peace of mind. I know, Mrs. Trudel. Do you have peace of mind? Think of your family. Dying's not cheap, and they'll have to pay. If you like I can... I can come right over. The contract takes 5 minutes. I see. No, I understand. Fine. Thanks again. Goodbye. I wish I could say it's fun, that I'm having fun. But I'm not. I'm kind of bored. And... I don't know how to play chess, so people think I'm dumb. 50 I think I'm going to leave. I expected more from that evening, I'm bitterly disappointed. Brothers and sisters, death has visited us once again. Gilles Pare is no longer with us. Our Creator has freed him from the woes of this world and welcomed him to eternal life. So today we gather here to celebrate Gilles'... So today we gather here to celebrate Gilles' joyous arrival to the new life God promises to his children. It's a chilly time of year. But I'm well dressed. I've been thinking about what you said. Forget what I said. I lost my first client today. I mean, he died. It happens. The company refuses to pay his wife. They say he made a false declaration. I'm sorry. Why? There's no reason. You can't be sorry for everyone. Not for everyone, I'm sorry for you. Thanks for the lift. Want to come in? Now? Yeah. I guess I look like that type. Like I want to come in. I don't know. Maybe you'd like to talk. Hello? Yes. Who is this? Yes. I'll wait for you. Goodbye. - Yes? - Hello. Can I come in? Yes. Sure. It's weird, it's just like our room. Exactly the same. The same, but turned around. - It 15? - Yeah, the furniture, the TV, everything. Except the pictures. The pictures aren't the same. I came to apologize for the noise, it's my fault. That's alright. I tend to be very loud. Some people keep it in, but me, it has to come out. That's OK. You think so? Well, in fact, the reason I'm here is that Denis and I... We wanted to ask you... Feel free to say no. But we thought that since you hear us through the wall, maybe you'd like to join us on our side. Would you like that? You want me to... But just to watch. I mean... We're not, what do you call it... How can I put it? I mean, just to watch. Goodness, I've embarrassed you. I'm very sorry. I didn't want to. Forgive me. No, look, it's just that... I'm a bit surprised. Would you like a drink? I have water. I'm glad you don't think I'm crazy. People are so narrow-minded. I hope you don't think we're perverts or anything. I mean, to be frank, it would be the first time for us. Thank you. Have you ever done it? No, not really. You see, we... I think we're at that stage. We've been married a while. And, well... I mean, after a while sex .... God, how can I put it? Well, sex... You know what I mean, right? Do I make you feel awkward? No. Often people are surprised if a woman talks about it too much. About sex. Especially after a certain age. I find people don't think enough about their sex life. Maybe they're together, they have problems, they don't know why. Often it's because of sex. Don't you think? Yes. I guess I'll be going. Thank you. I don't know... Would it be convenient in an hour? Sure, in an hour would be perfect. I'm really happy to have met you. - Diane. - Louis. Well then, see you in an hour. Was he alone? Yes. Maybe it wasn't him. But I think it was. It's hard to say. I'm really grateful for what you've done. Really. It's nothing. It says there's... A reward of some sort. Of course. Here. - Thank you. - Could you please stay a bit? What would you do in my shoes? I'm sorry. You're tired. You should go to bed, you'll feel better. Come with me. Pardon? Take me where you saw him. I can't go alone. It's all I'm asking. - Hello. - Come in. Have a seat. Don't mind the mess. Care for a drink? Yeah, how about a scotch? Have a look, Diane. I think there's some left. You must... Our proposal must seem a bit strange. A bit, yes. It was Diane's idea. You agreed, Denis! Yes, but it was your idea. Well, cheers! What do you do? I'm in insurance. An advisor. I used to be in sales too. Crazy hours. Now I'm in cement. Swimming pool decks, courtyards. We're here for the conference. We're squeezing in a little vacation too. I see. Might as well, while we're still healthy. That's true. Here we are, gabbing away. Diane, put on some music. His room doesn't answer. Can I take a message? Yes. Do you want to leave a number? I'll tell him. Goodbye. Good evening, can I help you? No thanks. I'll be fine. Here. I'm tired, Nicole. I'm tired.

LOUIS: So, it's unanimous. From now on, all first-years required to bill 2,800 hours and bring their own lunches. Congratulations, Louis, and another generation of associates smacked into submission. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'm done with this meeting. Harvey, please. We still have new business. Speaking of which, I'd like to propose a change to the current compensation formula. Excuse me? Well, since taking over the committee, I've been evaluating pay structures. And I think it's high time that this firm put a larger emphasis on billable hours. Why don't you stick to the 48th floor, Jack? I take it you have a problem with my proposal. You're damn right I do. I just took on the sale of a man's company and my entire fee is contingent-based. Because you operate as your own entity while the rest of us are members of a team known as this firm. No, because I bring in a truckload of money for this firm. Well, like I said, special rules for Harvey Specter. You know what, Jack? That's enough. The current system works fine. And I don't appreciate you speaking to Harvey in such a disrespectful manner. Are you shitting me? Harvey, I'm sorry. I had no idea... Save the sorries, Louis. This meeting's over. Harvey, listen. I'm on your side. Yeah, I don't need you on my side. Okay? I have shit to do. Wait. I haven't even brought up my proposal yet for the men's bathroom. You want to finish being King for a Day? Be my guest. Enjoy your coffee and your 50 sugars and go for it. But like I said, I have shit to do. Stanley was a good man. Never missed a day of work. Provided for his family. He didn't deserve what happened to him. And what did happen? Like I told the other lawyer, he went to the hospital with chest pains. They said it was nothing. He kept complaining. Stanley never complained. Two days later, they released him. Stanley went to sleep in our bed that night. And he never woke up. (swans) No, he didn't. Are you sure the hospital released him because the insurance company cut his stay? He was sick, Mr. Ross, and they just sent him home. There are over 200 other people who had the exact same thing happen to them. Do you think that's a coincidence? No, I don't. Which is why I'm considering reopening this case. So, what's stopping you? Well, for one thing, I want to know why your other lawyer dropped out. Because they worked that man to the bone. He almost lost his entire practice. But I was told that you're with a big, powerful firm. I am. But I don't know if I'm going to be able to get them to sign off on this. So, what are we supposed to do? You're supposed to sit tight. What the hell was that? What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about. You stormed out of the meeting that we were supposed to run together. I didn't storm out, I walked out. Because you were doing a shitty job running it. What are you talking about? I had your back. After you let that clown come after my salary. I didn't let him do anything. I defended you and then you smacked me down. After which I had to postpone a presentation that I was very passionate about. It's a bathroom, Louis. It smells sometimes. So, why don't you just go in there, do what people do in there, and get out of my face? You know what? Donna was right. I should have never tried to make things right with you. Make things right with me? Yeah, Harvey. I let Jack do that so that I could put him in his place and show you that I have your back. But you can't see it because you're too damn jealous of me and Donna. What did you just say to me? You're jealous. You know what, Louis? If I was so upset about the two of you, why am I still paying her salary? Bullshit, the firm pays her salary. Not all of it. You see, when I brought her over here from the DA's office, Jessica wouldn't hire her because I was an associate. So, I paid her salary. And then I made partner, and I didn't think it was enough, so I paid her more. And again and again and again. So, I've had enough of you telling me I'm jealous. Yeah, well, Donna doesn't work for you anymore. She works for me. And the only person who's going to be taking care of her salary? This guy. You got that? Fine by me. But before you say that, you better know what you're getting yourself into. Oh, yeah, I know what I'm getting myself into. Because you can't put a price tag on a woman like that. I need to talk to you. Let me guess. You got into a pissing contest with Harvey. He told you he's been covering Donna's salary. You, out of pride, said that you were going to take it on, and now you're here to find out how much you're on the hook for? Nothing like that. Oh, good. Then what is it? Everything you just said. Louis... Jessica, please. I just want to see the number. Okay, Louis. You want to see the number? Here's the number. Thank you... Holy goddamn shit. Are you sure you didn't accidentally add a zero? Yes, I'm sure. Is there any way the firm can... The firm is not going to pick this up. Harvey knew that, and he chose to pay her more anyway. What the hell am I supposed to do? Well, it seems to me you have two options. You can tell Donna that Harvey's been augmenting her salary and you don't want to do it anymore. Negatory. Or you can pay it yourself. Not happening. There is a third option. I can send her back to Harvey. How dare you. What do you mean I'm not liquid? Who told you to only save 10% cash? Well, I don't care what I said. Does my podiatrist listen to me when I tell him I have hammertoe? Is everything okay, Louis? Everything's wonderful. Okay. Actually, it occurred me that we have not discussed a very important subject. What is it? Donna, money is a very sensitive issue. Mmm-hmm. And I think you should be fairly compensated. I mean, I know how hard it was for you to leave Harvey for me, and I am forever grateful. It's just that I... Louis, shh. I don't need a huge raise. The standard 2% is more than enough. 2%? Yes. You have a huge heart, (WHISPERS) but I already make more than every other secretary at the firm. 2% it is. Thanks, Louis. Don't mention it. Hey, do you have a second? I need your legal advice about something. Yeah, of course. What is it? My fiancée left this prenup in the kitchen. I'm just wondering if you think I should sign it. Mike, it's not what it looks like. It looks like your father had a prenup prepared for you to make me sign. Then it's exactly what it looks like. And I'm guessing you don't want me to sign it. No, I don't. Because he's been trying to control me my entire life and I'm not going to let him do that with this. Has it occurred to you that maybe your father is only doing this because he loves you? I don't really care why he's doing it. Great marriages don't start with contracts. I know that. Then why are you grilling me? Because there's a reason that you didn't tell me about this and I need to know what it is. My dad said he doesn't know the man that I'm choosing to marry. And I just... I didn't want to tell you that. Well, I found out anyway. (SOFTLY) Yeah. Rachel, in the future, I want you to feel comfortable telling me this stuff in the first place. (WHISPERS) I will. Mr. Specter, I wanted to... You're still here? I don't leave until you leave. Well, in that case, what time is my meeting with Adidas? 11:15. I moved your 11:00 to 3:00 and your 3:00 to 5:00. Did you line up... Buyers? I did. But not for another week. Nike and Puma are overseas and you said Reebok didn't matter if the other two can't be there. God damn it. There's one more thing. What difference does it make? I can't delay the sale if I don't Know why my client is dumping his company on a whim. That's the one more thing. Mr. Doyle's best friend died a month ago. Pancreatic cancer. He was 46. How did you know that? Something he said to you just before he started talking shit about me stuck in my head. And what exactly was that? When people say life is short two times in 30 seconds, it's usually right after somebody died. I takeit you were listening to our conversation. That's what good secretaries do. Sorry about the Keebler thing. You didn't say it. Besides, it doesn't take Albert Einstein to figure out why you hired somebody that looks like me to replace someone that looks like her. Listen, Gretchen, I. .. You don't have to worry about that with me. I prefer my men manly. Am I not manly? Well, if you have to ask... Mike, how are you doing? Robert. What can I do for you? I heard you wanted me to sign a prenup. (CHUCKLES) I did. I hope you didn't take it personally. Of course not. I'm happy to sign it. But Rachel did say that you don't know what kind of guy I am. So, I thought I'd come here to show you that this is the kind of guy I am. You're going after Kelton Insurance? No, it's not about who I'm going after, it's about who I'm representing. I'm putting my ass on the line for 200 people who have no one to fight for them other than me. So, if you're worried that I'd go after Rachel's money if something went wrong... You're not that type of guy. No, I'm not. I respect that. Thank you, sir. But let me tell you something. I used to be one of those people. And I scratched and clawed my way to where I am today. Which is why I know when you come from nothing and you make yourself into something, you're always waiting for the day they're going to come and take it away. And I'm telling you that I come from nothing and I would never do that. I'm not saying you're going to take it. I'm saying you might do something that makes someone else take it. What do you mean? You're learning at the feet of Harvey Specter and Jessica Pearson. And they know something I know. You're going to be a great lawyer. You're going to crack some eggs. And you never know when someone's going to come at you to take what's yours for something you did. Robert, I would never... Just let me finish. I'm telling you this because you're going to be family. You might not have crossed any lines yet, but you will. And I'm just trying to protect my baby girl. Jessica, you wanted to see me? Actually, Louis wants to see both of us. HARVEY: Then let's get it over with. Okay. I would like to propose a revamping of the pay structure under the following guidelines. We increase the percentage of billables that partners get. We decrease the percentage of contingent fees by an offsetting amount. What? That's what Jack Soloff said yesterday. No, this is different. I've capped the amount it affects any one partner. You've got to be shitting me. Now, I know you're wondering why I'm proposing this. It's crystal clear why you're proposing it. You get the exact amount to cover Donna's salary and you take it out of my paycheck. Louis. LOUIS: This has nothing to do with that. Jack had a great idea, it just needed some fine-tuning. Fine-tuning? You're the one that said you only let him bring it up so that you could smack it down. Is that true? Yes, maybe, but I had some time to think about it. Jack put something on the table and it's our duty to follow through on it. Oh, bullshit. You're only following through on it because you're a cheap son of a bitch. Harvey. I don't want to hear it, Jessica. Yesterday, he accused me of being jealous. Today, he's coming after my money. No, I'm not... Shut up. We both know Donna going to work for you has nothing to do with you. You got lucky. Lucky? Like a monkey who won the lottery. So, the least you can do is be a man, pay her yourself, or suck it up and tell her the truth. JESSICA: That's enough. We're not doing this. lam a name partner. JESSICA: Louis. No, he has no right to... I will slap the taste out of your mouth. Thanks, Jessica. I appreciate you being on the same page. Oh, we're not on the same page. What are you talking about? I wanted the two of you to run that meeting yesterday to see if you were okay with each other. But you're not. He may be cheap, but he's right. You are taking your Donna anger out on him and it needs to stop. I don't have Donna anger. Oh, like hell you don't. And if you don't admit that to yourself, I'll slap the taste out of your mouth, too. What are you working on there, Mike? Um. Nothing. Just some clean-up. What can I do for you, Jessica? You can tell me why you reopened a case against a major insurance company we were never a part of to start with. Um... I reopened it because I looked at it and it's a winner. Well, I also looked at it, and I say it's a loser. Jessica... You took a case on contingency where every plaintiff is dirt poor. Which means even if we win, compensation for lost wages is nothing. You're leaving out punitive damages. And Harvey takes cases on contingency all the time. Yeah, he takes them to make money, not to save kittens in trees. And I just told you, this is going to make money. And that's what you said about Liberty Rail. And instead of making money, it almost ended with Donna behind bars. No one is going to jail for this. No, they're not. Because it's going to cost a fortune to fund and I'm not laying out that kind of money on a long shot. Jessica, look, I promised myself... I don't you care who you promised. You took this case without running it by me and you did it because you knew I'd say no. Jessica... So that's enough. Dump it. Or I will. I need to talk to you. Really? Because the last time you talked to me, you told me to open my mouth and you slammed it shut. Because you wanted to go after Harvey. But now, I'm on board. Why should I believe you? Answer me this. How many partners do you have in your pocket if we put your proposal to a vote? I can get 45%. Well, then, the reason you can believe me is that I'm going to get you the difference. How are you going to do that if you don't have the courage to back my plan at your own meeting? By showing everyone at this firm exactly what Harvey makes. (LAUGHS) Now I know you're bullshitting me. You'd be fired if you did that. Not if I do it by accident. Can you believe that sneaker brings in over $1 billion from China alone? With earnings like that, makes me wonder why you're trying to rip off my client. Buying a man's company for a fair price is hardly ripping him off. But it's not a fair price. You gave my client 48 hours to take your offer. I'm going to give you five minutes to take mine. Double your money or I walk out the door. That's ridiculous. What's ridiculous is you preying on a man who just lost his lifelong friend. I'm a businessman, not a grief counselor. Then let me counsel you on this. Because he's grieving, I have the ability to go to the board and delay this sale. But you're not going to, because you know it will drive down the price even more when he eventually wants to sell anyway. You're right, it will. But I'll tell you what, Mr. Polk. It will still be worth more than your offer. And after my client's grief passes, he may still want to sell. But it sure as hell won't be to you. I gotta call you back. How the hell did you get in here? I fired your assistant 10 minutes after I fired you. Guess Amy still knows how to get a person through. Congratulations. You made your way in, you can make your way out. Not before I give you the chance to make $20 million. Mmm-hmm. What makes you think I want to get in the business of underwriting class-action lawsuits? Because you're in the business of making money. And before you say no, I'm going to give you 20% off the top. That's the best deal out there. Well, that's not good enough. 25%. Are you authorized to do that? No, you're not. Knowing you, you probably don't even have the authorization to come to me in the first place. I came to you because this is our chance to make it right. Bullshit. You need money. That's the only reason you're standing here in front of me. Jonathan, I could have gone anywhere. I came to you for the same reason I went to Walter Gillis. To make it right. Pick up the phone and ask him. I'm not Walter Gillis. Tell Amy I said thank you for getting you past security. 'Cause now, I'm going to call every investment banker I know and tell them to pass on your offer, because Mike Ross can't be trusted. What the hell is this? I have no idea what you're talking about. Yes, you do. This is Harvey's last three income statements and I found them sitting in the copy machine. Donna, I need you to put that back where you found it, I need you to put it back now. I won't do it. That was not a request. That was an order. I don't care. I'm not going to let you do this. See? I knew that you would jump at the first opportunity you had to take his side over mine. This isn't me taking Harvey's side. This is me stopping you from making a huge mistake. And if he did the same thing, you wouldn't be stopping him. Harvey would never do anything like this. And if he did, I sure as hell would. Oh, bullshit. No, Louis. It's not bullshit. You have no idea how many times I kept him from going overboard with you. It was half my goddamn job. Well, you know what? You didn't stop him every time. And you're not stopping me this time. Now, give me that thing. Okay, fine. You don't want to put it back? I'll do it myself. Louis... No, Donna, you know what? You came to work for me. You knew who I was when you did. So now it's time for you to decide. Are you with me or not? While I'm not opposed to unexpected gifts on my desk, I do prefer if they're made of chocolate. Got it. Next time I leave you a signed prenup, it will be made of chocolate. Why did you sign it? I went to see your dad. You did what? I wanted to show him what Kind of man his daughter was marrying. Because I wanted him to trust me. Mike, he doesn't trust anybody, which is exactly why I'm not interested in his marital advice. But like you said, I would appreciate it if, in the future, you tell me if you're going to do something like that. You're right. I should have told you before I went over there. But for the record, instead of getting him to trust me, I ended up trusting him. Mike. Rachel, listen to me. I know you think that he's doing this to control you, but he thinks he's doing it to protect you. And the truth is that I never had a father who could do something like that for me. So, I think that you should try and see where he's coming from. What's that? It's your new offer. It's twice the money. It's what I do. And that's why I pay you so much. I didn't do it for the money, Teddy. I did it because you were getting ripped off. And I'm not going to let that happen to you no matter what the circumstances. You found out. Yeah, why didn't you tell me what happened? Because I didn't want you to try and stop me. You still could have come to me. And tell you what? That my best friend from when we were seven died out of the blue? I hadn't spoken to him in 20 years because we got into a fight over some woman whose name I can't even remember? And now I don't give a shit about the sneaker business? Well, I would have understood. Would you have? Look, Harvey. I appreciate what you did for me. And if I'm ever back in business, you'll always be my lawyer. I'll always be your friend. HARVEY: Louis, do you have a second? Oh, I don't know. What animal are you going to call me now? An iguana? I'm not going to call you anything. I'm here because I want to put everything behind us. Well, aren't I lucky. Louis, please. You were right. I was a dick in that meeting, and again in the bathroom, and again with Jessica. I said some things that I wish I could take back. But we've been friends with each other for a long time, and, uh... I don't want to throw that away. You really mean that? I do. (CHUCKLES) Come here. Harvey. This is amazing. I never thought you would come to me. Oh, shit. "Oh, Shit," what? I forgot I have to put a bid on an item on eBay. What? A Mongolian... Preying mantis. Piano. Ballet. Good talk, I have to go. What is that? You shouldn't be reading that. That's privileged information. Where the hell did you... (INAUDIBLE) Oh, shit. What's that for? It's a retainer. lam looking for some legal advice. I don't think you can afford me. (LAUGHS) It won't take long. I just wanted you to take a look at this. You got Mike to sign this? My dad did. Then why are you coming to me? Because you once told me that you have a father just like mine. Ah, let me guess. You think Robert is trying to control you. He did manage to construct a situation where the two most important men in my life are making decisions about me without me. You know what I think? I think this has nothing to do with your dad and you know it. Mike. Yes. Mike. That's the real reason why you're coming to me, even though you told yourself it wasn't. It could protect me. It could. It could also do something else. Undermine my relationship. Believe me, I learned that one the hard way. Which means you need to ask yourself, how much do you really love Mike? I love him all the way. Then don't sign it. On the house. And Rachel, as far as your father goes, he and I don't always see eye-to-eye, but I do respect that man. And if he is anything like my father, for all of his faults, he would take a bullet before he'd let anything happen to his little girl. (WHISPERS) Thank you. (MUSIC PLAYING) Uh, okay. Harold and I ponied up last time because it was a special occasion. But tonight, drinks are on you, my friend. That's fair. As much as I appreciate it, Jimmy, I've got to return the gift. What? Yeah. I can't take the case. No,no,no. What do you mean, you can't take the case? Jessica won't lay out the money for the man hours. Okay, then get somebody else to lay out the money. Mike, investment banks are taking stakes in shit like this now. You of all people should know that. You think I didn't try that? It didn't work. God damn it, Mike. You always said you gave a shit about people. And you said that I could return this case. I don't care what I said. Jimmy, what the hell is going on here? Okay, one of the victims was my uncle Keith. But I didn't tell you about him because my cousin came to me and asked me to make it right, and I promised her that I would. It's just I don't have the juice at my firm and I was... I was too ashamed to tell you. Jimmy. No, Mike, listen. Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you straight up. But please, these people need your help. What can I do for you, Jack? You can explain to me how the hell you justify making this much money. Where did you get this? It was left in the copy machine. By who? I don't know. But now I do know why you pissed all over my idea at the meeting. This is confidential. It was confidential. Now every senior partner's seen it, and people are furious. Learn every penny I make. We'll see about that. What are you talking about? I just called for a vote tomorrow on my proposal. And I hope you've been saving your money, because your gravy train is about to leave the station. So, this was why you said, "Oh, shit." What's that? Oh, you know what it is. Because you're the one who left it in the goddamn copier. Oh, my God, Harvey. I was making copies of everyone's salaries for my records and I must've... Bullshit, Louis. You did this to come after me. And after I apologized, you ran and tried to stop it. Harvey, please. What's done is done. And like you said before, we're friends. We can move past this. And we can fight the vote together. There's no way I win the vote after people see this. You want to get past it? Admit what you did. That's automatic termination. Then we'll fight that together. Harvey, I can't. Louis! Jessica tried to fire me once. I can't give her the chance to do that again. Well, you know what? It's going to happen again because I know what you did. All right, you know what? That's enough. And you come at me flinging accusations, well, you better have proof. You have proof, Harvey? Yeah, I didn't think so. (KNOCKING) Harvey, you don't get to come to me at all hours of the night anymore. I'm here because your new boss... I know why you're here. Then you know what he did. And I need you to admit it so I can block their bullshit vote. And get Louis fired. He wouldn't be in this mess if you'd have just stopped him from doing this in the first place. Harvey, if I knew Louis was going to do something like this, and I'm not saying I did, then I would have told him to his face not to. But if he went ahead and did it anyway, then I'm not going to go behind his back to fix it. Because you always said, once you pick a side, if you're not loyal to that side, then who the hell are you? Then you should have thought of that before you picked someone who would do something like this in the first place. You want to know what kind of man Louis is? This whole thing started because he wanted to prove to you that he had your back because he thought you were jealous of us. No. This whole thing started because I told him that I've been paying your salary since we came to the firm. And he was too cheap to pay it himself and too weak to tell you the truth. And if you've kept that from me for 12 years and you're only just telling me now, then maybe you are jealous. Mike, how did you get in? We give you a key already? No, Laura let me in. She said you'd be back here. I don't know why. I'm trying to find something tasty. (CHUCKLES) But not one damn thing that's bad for you in this entire house. Then I guess it's a good thing I didn't tell her that I brought you these. Oh. Chicken nuggets? Rachel made them herself. Deep fried, not baked? You're welcome. She sign that prenup? No. But she sent those because she realized the prenup was about love, not control. Then I respect her decision. What changed her mind about me? You really want to know? Mmm-hmm. Jessica. Oh, shit. What did she say? I've got to know that secret. I don't know what she said to Rachel, but I know what she said to me. So, that's why you're here. Yeah, those people that I told you I was fighting for? (SIGHS) Jessica's not going to go for it. I get it. Too much money to lay out for too little payoff. But you said you came from the same place as these people. Robert, they need someone like you to fight for them and I can't do it. So, I'm asking you to. You think this case is a winner? I do. Then what do you say we do it together? What are you doing here, Louis? I notice you didn't come to the vote this morning. No, I didn't. I was busy closing a deal for my client. Let me guess. You had him backdate your sale to yesterday, so it falls under your old pay structure. No, Louis, that's something you would do. Because unlike you, I don't actually care about the money. You expect me to believe that? I don't care whether you believe it or not. My compensation package was about recognizing what I do. Money was just a consequence. That's why I didn't mind sharing it with Donna. Now, get out. No. You did care about the money. Because it was the last thing you had that separated you from me. Excuse me? I got name partner, I got Donna, and that drove you nuts. So, you shit on me at the meeting and then you pretended to apologize. I did apologize, Louis. I came to you like a man, and then when I gave you the chance to make it up to me, you choked, like you always do. Well, how do you like me now? Because the only thing you had left was that you made more and now you don't. And I win. You didn't win anything. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the fact that no matter what you get, you're always wanting more. And the problem with always wanting more is that the second you get it, it can always be taken away. You're not reversing that vote. I'm not talking about the vote. I'm talking about what you value most. That's right. It might not happen today or tomorrow, but it's going to happen. Because I'm going to make it happen. One day, you're going to walk into your office and she's going to be gone. Merci! Don't worry. Her last appointment just left. Thanks, Sophia. Sorry. My sister threatened to burn all my clothes if I didn't go shopping with her. Don't worry. Did you say your sister came down with you? No. Why? What's going on, Norah? You got my scan back. Mmm. Well, I've seen enough of these to know that's a healthy one. Mmm. This was six months ago, when you were clear. Here's the scint scan we just did. Two years ago, when you first told me I had cancer? Mental Ward C, Dr. Mesner. Natalie. Hello. Hi. Um... It's... um, the dark spots are where the cancer has spread? Yes, except this is from a patient I saw this morning. This... is yours. You have a four centimetre tumour in your right kidney. - That's all? - That's all. - And that's good? - It's not terrible. We'll have to remove the organ. You can live a perfectly normal life with one kidney. And my hair? I was about to grow it out. Since there's no metastasis, radical nephrectomy has an 80 percent cure rate. That means no chemo or radiation. But if my scan looked like your other patient's? Then there wouldn't be much hope. In a case like this, we have a name for it... I'm the Christmas Tree. - I don't want cheese. - You need the calcium. I told you to get the low-fat. Can I get an extra apple? - This is annoying. - So don't read it. Some of us still read things that aren't on screens. Some of us are wondering who died and made you God. Did you know that 300 million sperm attack one single egg to fertilize it? How is that fair? Dunno. But, ultimately, the egg decides which one to let in. What kind of a choice is that? 300 million to 1? - It's nature. - Easy for you to say. The egg doesn't feel anything. And you know this from experience? No. Mom... Think about it this way, Romy. Most of the sperm don't make it, - but the egg survives. - But it's always the girl who's left holding the bag. I mean, look at you. - Hey. - What? Go get ready for school. Emma, you too. Lunch? It's your favourite. - You don't have to do this anymore. - Yeah, try and stop me. Hello? Oh, hi, Auntie Nicole. No, no, everything's great. Just another morning in paradise. Auntie Nicole wants us over for dinner tonight. I have a huge test to study for that'll probably determine my future, but here's Mom. Hi. You sure you wanna go to all that trouble? I understand if you're busy, but I bought all this food... Your folks are coming anyway, - and I left a message for your sister. - You keep Anakin, but Thor stays - here, OK? - No, no, no. Actually, she can't take either. Remember? - Why? - It's policy at Abby's school. Superheroes engender cultural violence. Hey, tell my sister I insist. I insist! - How does 6:00 sound? - 6:00 is great. - Wonderful. Bring nothing, OK? - See you then. What? - I have dinner plans with Ariel. - And I wasn't lying about that math test. Romy, back me up. We do have a math test tomorrow, but she was probably lying about studying for it. Well, now I'm going to. Diligently. You better. We leave in five. I can't talk right now. He looks normal, but we agreed you weren't gonna do this. Hmm? That lawyer from your firm you wanted me to meet? Oh, right. What was I thinking? Hey, are you going to Matthew's for dinner tonight? Mom and Dad are gonna be there. Oh, she sweetens the deal. You are just like my children. Do you remember when they used to love family dinners? I'm just like your children because I have my own life. And I don't? I gotta go. Why are you whispering? I'm not; I'm just... just a little hoarse. Did you just call yourself a little whore? Hoarse. I'm a little hoarse. You're at some guy's house, aren't you? You hooked up last night. Oh, crap. Hey, I managed to catch the red-eye. Mm? You've gotta be kidding me. I didn't know. I swear. Shoes... my shoes. Nice shoes. Come on! I'm not a chauffeur. 60 seconds and I'm gone. You're riding? - What about your sister? - She's 13. She'll be fine - without me. - It's a new school for her. - She's still adjusting. - I'm going out for triathlon, OK? - I need to train. - Why? - Who else is doing it? - Cecilia. What's the difference? Hey! Did you lock the kitchen door? Well, it's a big time commitment. You're the one always telling me to push myself. Yeah, to focus on your grades instead of your social life. Mm-hm. OK, I want you to go straight there. Nice. Where's the trust? - I don't wanna hear you were late again. - Well, I'm sure you won't. She hates that I'm in some of her classes, you know. She's just riding because she joined triathlon. Based on her guitar lesson fail, I give the week. Jayden! I didn't realize you rode this way. It's the hardest way up. - And that's a good thing? - Obviously. Builds strength. Not sure that's a day dress, Margaret. No, of course not. No, I... see, look. I have this right here. It's very "admin assistant." Get changed in the washroom this time. Absolutely. That was... I thought everyone had left for the night. I... I need every last scrap indexed. So this morning's biology lecture? It was just something to make me seem interesting. "Be interested, not interesting." I read that somewhere. I think I read somewhere that life isn't fair. Not always. But it can often be wonderful. I thought maybe you guys stopped to get a room. Don't ask. Train wreck. Well, at least you still have the swimsuit portion of the sport. Crap. I took the broken one. Bye, Mom. I love you. - I still can't talk. - I was afraid he kidnapped you. - Whatever random you went home with. - No, but I did get lured into - an accidental home wrecking. - Hmm. What you said this morning... - Did you mean it? - I don't know, what did I say? - That I don't have a life. - Did I? Because I won't let you set me up with anyone? OK, message received. I will never try it again. I know you think I focus too much on the kids instead of all that, but Romy doesn't have any friends, which Emma couldn't care less about, - and Caleb is... - Natalie. Can you hear yourself? Your kids are fine. You did mean it. Yeah, OK, fine. Maybe I think you could stand to focus on yourself a little bit more. Says the 30-year-old who lives like she's 20? Well, at least I know who I am. Are you saying that I don't? Look at your Facebook profile. You used to care so much about your column, but now... Look. Don't get me wrong, OK? I think you are a great mother. I do. I just... sometimes I miss the old version of you. You know? The fun, impulsive Natalie who would buy booze for my friends and I when we were underage, or who ran off with David after four dates. Yeah, OK, maybe that wasn't the best example. You hung up on me, didn't you? Hi. Sorry. Didn't we say 20 minutes ago? The seminar went late. They were talking about this. Hmm. I'd build houses in Africa. You're leaving for a whole summer? I mean, it'll help me get into that architecture program, right? What if I come too? - Really? - I don't need it for school, but it'll be an adventure. I don't know. You don't want me to. No, no. I was gonna say... I'm probably not even going. I bet my mom will need me around this summer, so... Have you asked her? Maybe she'd want you to go. You know, we never do anything fun anymore. At least talk to her. Maybe I will. I'm waiting on inspiration, so I'm getting out of here. What are you doing right now? You picked up the pieces after David left. Raised three kids on your own, and you were there for me when Kevin joined the Air Force... which was about half an hour after they cut out your kidney. Yeah, so doesn't that make Maggie's point for her? What has your sister ever done with her life but seek instant gratification? So have you heard from Kevin? Nothing. For three weeks. Not much from his father, either. And that one I still live with. - Hi! - Why do we keep that rusted lock in the shed if it's broken? I have no idea what you're talking about. I had to ride all the way back home to get one that actually works. Oh, so you were late for school this morning. Oh, so, what? You'd rather I get my bike stolen? Emma has joined triathlon. Oh. Young men in speedos. Can I come cheer you on? D, they're teenagers. Fine. Spoil my fun. - That's always the case. It's not fair. - I know, I know. It's just not, it's not. - Cocktail hour already? - It's only rosé. It's basically one step away from herbal tea. - Hi, Natalie. - Hi, Ariel. Young love. - Mom, do you want some wine? - Yes, thanks. I'd hoped to see your kids tonight, Natalie. Uh, yeah. Well, the girls had to study and Caleb was busy. So this is braised brisket with pearl onions. All this on a Wednesday night? It only takes about 20 minutes to get ready. - That's the beauty of it. - Slow cooker. Yeah, a friend of Matthew's from medical school served us - this exact dish last weekend. - Next morning, she rushed out, - she bought one. - I did. I'm happy to make a batch for you and the kids. Take supper off your plate once in a while. - Thank you, Nicole. It's really good. - Yeah. - Mm, thank you. - We aren't worthy. - Well, speak for yourself. - Actually, she meant me. What was that, Natalie? Tell them. Let's crowdsource this. What? Earlier today, I merely floated the idea that Nat spends a little bit too much time worrying about her - kids at the expense of herself. - Aw, what does that even mean? You can't possibly know what that's like. You don't have children. Oh, no, that's right. Of course. I am a complete - disappointment in every way. - No, no. No one is saying that. Not everybody needs to have children. - Yeah, well, not everyone should. - Not everyone can. - Oh, nice. What? - That's enough. Oh, yes. That's not pleasant. - Simon says... - Not now, honey. - We'll play later, OK? - Simon says... his girlfriend wants to meet you. Simon? - Is that my phone? Sweetie? - Who's Simon? Abigail, hands off other people's things, OK? Go play, sweetie. Must be nice. Life without responsibility. She does her own thing. She always has. You keep letting her off the hook, she's never gonna grow up, Dad. She has a 9 to 5 job now. Yeah. And maybe she has a point about me. No, she doesn't. And you don't have to worry about your kids. - Your kids are great. - Let's drink up. - To children! - Here's to kids. Dad! Lift your glass. To adult children. ...collapse at the core of a massive star. Something like 25 or 30 times the mass of the sun or more. Ride the boy. See how long you can stay up. - No. - Yes. Just do it, just do it. - You sure? - Yep. Whoa, whoa, whoa! You know. Oh, my God! Stop, stop, stop! - Whew. - OK, ready for this one? - You know this one. - OK. Mm-hmm. - Not too high. Not too high! - You can do that. - No! - Just do it. Oh, I can't do this. Stop. ... their power in the centre of galaxies. The supermassive black holes are at the centre of the galaxy... There's a theory in quantum mechanics that the universe is so big that somewhere there could be another Earth exactly like ours. - Scientists didn't think super... - Mm-hmm? - ...massive the black hole existed... - Don't you two have a test you're supposed to be studying for? Aren't you supposed to be out for dinner with Ariel? ...safe from the fatal attraction... Oh, my God. Are you in there scandalizing your girlfriend while we're literally sitting 10 feet away, learning about science? Go. Study. Scientists believe... Maybe on the second Earth, he's less of a dick. Yeah, I doubt it. ...the Milky Way. And because we can't readily... - Writing? - Barely. - Goodnight, Ariel. - Goodnight. - Call me when you get home. - 'K. It's your girlfriend. She just left. Tell her to gear down. Why don't you get some sleep? Otherwise your brain won't develop and then what'll happen? - Hey. Yep, me too. - I love you. Pathetic. Call you later. You guys seem serious. "Yoga for the soul"? Yeah, I get invited every year. In The Laurentians, for two weeks. You're thinking of going? Hey, would you be OK with the girls if I did go? "Imagine having clarity about knowing who you truly are and what the purpose of your life is." Seriously, you buy this? No, not really. I don't know. I probably won't go. You should. I'll be around. I have summer courses. Thanks. "For the soul." Ms. Lawson. - Natalie. - Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Andrew Wallace. I'm the new principal. Thanks for coming in. Why don't you have a seat? Um, yeah. Is this about Emma? I know she was late again... She struggles with her priorities, certainly, but she just joined the triathlon team. I think she's just a little bit frazzled. Actually, I asked you here to talk about Romy. Yeah, I guess my assistant didn't say. I'm sorry. Please. Why? What happened? Well... she made zigzags as answers. 6 out of 64. She tanked on purpose. Spoken with her teachers. There's a consensus Romy's... not adjusting entirely to her new school. Which means? Other than this? Well, she doesn't engage in class and she mostly keeps to herself, I think. After I pushed so hard for her to skip a grade. I know. I was looking at her files. She was way ahead of her peers last year. And she absolutely refused the gifted school the board recommended. Well, that doesn't always make things easier. Being gifted. Hmm... They should come up with another name for it. Romy is not a bad kid. I know that. I spent time with her today, in fact. She's... she's awesome. She's a great kid. She reminds me of a boy I taught a few years ago, actually. Do I wanna know how? Um... Kind of a look he gave me. Like the world moves too slowly for him. I am painfully familiar with that look. Well, eventually, he adjusted. - So that's good news. - How? An adolescent psychologist I know helped him kind of sort some things out. His name is Lucas Carson, and if you're at all open to the idea, it could be really good for Romy, I think. She's really not going to like that. - Well, no, of course. - What should I tell her about this test? I wouldn't say anything for now. I'll deal with her teachers, and we'll adjust gently. How does that sound? Saying nothing isn't really my style. Which is good for her. The psychologist's number? It's mine. I'll reach out to the psychologist for you. - Your number. - Mm-hmm. - Um, that would be for? - For calling me. If you ever need to. Right. - Whoops... - Thank you. Why are you ignoring my texts? Because this is way too much work for a one-night stand. Well, that's what I'm trying to say. We want something more. "We"? Look, I have no idea what you told your girlfriend about me and I don't really care, you know? You're looking to spice things up in your relationship, so maybe you need to buy some toys. OK, here's the thing. Sarah and I are looking for new experiences. Come on! What are you afraid of? - I gotta go. - Oh, what? Some other guy? Yeah. Hey! I'm glad you called. I thought you'd like to know I was recently flirted with. How dare he. Wait... don't tell me you actually - enjoyed it. - Shut up. I'm still mad at you. Yeah? Then why call me? Because... - maybe you were right about me. - Was I? Huh. You should let me punch you in the face. - What? - Yeah, I've started boxing lessons instead of using my pent-up aggression to murder my boss. - Oh, that sounds functional. - Yeah, it's probably too violent for you, but it makes me feel great. - No, book it. I'm in. - 'K. - Good day? - Mm. Whatcha working on? Book report. That's always fun. Except for the part where I have to decide - what book to read. - Well, if you need any help... Here's the list my teacher gave me. I was thinking about this one. The Catcher in the Rye. That might be a little dark. This is one of my favourites. - Little Women? - Mm. Everything you like is, like, two centuries old. Well, they're both good. Everything on that list is good. Where's my charger? Oh! - That's mine! - Hey, Em... What? I was thinking about taking you shopping for gear, OK? Proper running shoes. Regulation bicycle helmet. What happened to triathlon being this major time suck? Well, if you are really committed to it, I'm impressed. Why don't you just give me the money? I'll go by myself. Hi, I'm not available. Please leave a message. You hear that, Jim? That's a plate by Adam Fogler, 150 bucks a piece, which I just smashed in our sink. So the next time you decide to not call me and let me know that I'm gonna be eating alone again like a pathetic fool, why don't you ask yourself how much it'll cost to replace the whole set? Oh, and in the meantime, let's see if you really did get the best garburator money can buy. 'K, chin down, hands up. Hands up. OK, go! There you go. Again! Good stuff. Your sister's a natural. Here we go. Come on, Paperweight. You ready to rumble? Ooh. Go on. Bring the pain. Seriously? That was weaker than your Monday column. Because my job requires independent thought. Well, since we're getting personal? I think you're afraid to really hit me. Oh, I think you're afraid to get hit. I like it rough. Oh! I'm sorry. Um... Your mom asked me to bring some food over for the girls. Oh. They got hungry. They went to The Dep for candy... - If I'd known you were... - I'm sorry, I... I'm sorry. Are you hungry? I've got a pretty decent cassoulet here. Yeah, sure. Thanks. - I'll leave it on the counter upstairs. - OK. Whew! Oh, God. Nat! Are you OK? Nat? I'm OK. It's OK. I had an operation two years ago. It's just sensitive. I'm OK. Michael Crawford, 340... Michael Crawford, please call 340. - Natalie. - Hi. I'm not supposed to see you for another month. Yeah, but they squeezed me in early. - Feeling alright? - Mm-hmm. Little bit tired. Tired... like a mother with three kids? You know it. - How are yours doing? - They're good. Hanging in there. Oh! Sorry. There's just - a little bit of pain. - I see that. Yeah, it's 'cause I went boxing. - Boxing. - Yeah, with my sister. Um, it's getting better fast, though. No swelling. Some bruising. We'll do a scint. - Are you worried? - Almost due for one anyway. I'd rather be on the safe side. Proof correspondence to Williams, Beekman. Send invoices to Keller, Parsons, and take a letter for me in the Stanley case to opposing council... Dear sir, comma. It has come to my attention that your client has been having ex parte communications with the employees of my client, period. Please advise your client to cease and desist this practice immediately, failing which the necessary proceedings will be taken without further notice or delay. Did you get that? Yes. Uh, "proof correspondence to Williams, Beekman, send invoices to Keller, Parsons." I changed my mind. We are not quitting. We are getting in that water and going for a swim. I do see the appeal. Forget about him. Let's do this. Hello? Natalie. It's Andrew. - Wallace? - Hi. Yeah, I recognized your voice. - How are you? - Fine. - And you? - I'm good. I, uh... I heard you went boxing? Oh! You read my column. Yeah. So if I ask you out to dinner, promise you won't beat me up? Are you serious? Any chance you're free tonight? This isn't against any ethics code, now, is it? I don't want to end up on the front page of my own newspaper. There's no official codes, no. Just the good sense of two adults. - OK, then. - OK. Great, well, I'll, I'll, er, I'll call you later with some plans, then. - Hmm. - Thank you, Natalie. "Thank you, Natalie." God! What if most of what we tell ourselves is wrong? Well, can we fix that? When is it too late? This isn't easy to write and the temptation to delete the whole thing is great, but forget every word I've ever written... because today I start again. So what are we shopping for? - Lingerie. - Um, what if he actually wants to see me in it? - I should book us in for a wax. - Well, that sounds fun. Just a wax! Not even a Brazilian. Just a straight-up, simple bikini wax. Merci! Don't worry. Her last appointment just left. Thanks, Sophia. Michael Crawford to gate... It's stage four renal cell carcinoma. All this spread in six months? I'm as shocked as you are. The rate of growth is very unexpected. But, hey, if I hadn't been hurt, you wouldn't have even done a scan. So that's something, right? I mean, at least now we know? Except this time, there's no positive prognosis. If the biopsy confirms the scan, our first job will be to control the disease, to buy you time. To buy me time. I'm not gonna get better? There are always new treatments. I'm not saying we don't have options, Natalie. You don't have to do this, Norah. OK? Not with me. Just tell me. How much time do I have? It's impossible to say for sure. Well, months. Years. Months. A year. Maybe a little more. I really thought this was behind me. Me too. How do I tell my kids? We have a social worker available here, if you want to talk to someone... No, no, thank you. I've got my family. My office will be in touch tomorrow about a biopsy appointment. If you have any questions at all, you have my number. - Thank you. - Natalie! Don't forget these. I'm so sorry. Me too. - Rest Area - EXIT - Nurses Station - Ms. Lawson? Are you OK? Yes... yes. I-I'll be fine. I'm sorry about Africa. It was your idea in the first place. I know. I promise it's not about you. I just can't go this year. It's fine. Everything will stay the same, then. On the next This Life... Maggie, I'm dying. You can't tell anyone. The children don't know. You're my child and I know when you're hiding something. Mum, don't do this. How am I going to leave them alone? For our next death-defying spectacular, the Cavalcade of Mysteries! As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, blades - deadly sharp. No magic for you tonight, then, Miss? Well, I wouldn't say that, Mr Butler. Jack. Of course, Miss Fisher. No doubt an unexpected guest is far more enticing than an expected one. Allow me to introduce to you the new patron of MacKenzie's Cavalcade of Mysteries - the Baron of Richmond. Any final words, Miss Pearl? Quick and clean, please, Mr MacKenzie. Oh, Miss, I hope I didn't spoil your evening. Don't worry, Dot, my plans were already sabotaged by an unexpected house guest. But the less said about him, the better. Miss Fisher, what happened to your prior engagement? I dealt with that. Pearl Dyson - magician's assistant, cut off in her prime. You know, I saw the original Cavalcade of Mysteries as a child. I can't imagine you small and harmless. Well, I was definitely small. And, luckily for you, I paid attention. I can lend you my notes, if you'd like, Hugh. I-I think I can manage. Thanks, Dottie. Now, this guillotine is a rather rudimentary model, but the principle remains the same. So, I assume the trick is to keep the lethal section of the blade out of the way. Exactly. With this. By pulling out... .. this small nail. Now, perhaps you could pass me some vegetation and I'll demonstrate. Unless, of course, you'd like to volunteer. Now... .. without that small nail... .. the blade should be rendered absolutely harmless. How? What's this? Another nail - with the head filed off. This was no accident. Something must have gone wrong. Think harder! I did everything as always. I told you to... It's happening again, isn't it? I knew it was happening again, I knew it! Inspector. Mr MacKenzie, meet Miss Fisher - private detective. And Mr MacKenzie's right-hand woman, Miss Eva Callahan. Callahan. It was once Callahan's Cavalcade of Mysteries, wasn't it? Yes, this was originally my father's show. Oh, what a dreadful accident. None of us can fathom it. My poor Pearl. The deceased was Mr MacKenzie's fiancee. My condolences, Mr MacKenzie. We don't really understand what happened, do we? I mean, every detail was correct. I'm afraid your guillotine was deliberately sabotaged. So poor Pearl was murdered? Lord, no! Oh, she was so kind and generous. This theatre is now a crime scene. You'll all be questioned in turn, so please remain in the building. So, who else had access to the guillotine before it was wheeled on-stage? Anyone who used the prop store. Sid Forest is in charge, then there's myself, MacKenzie, Sarah Norden has her contortionist props in the store. She joined the act around the same time as Pearl - they were... very close. Thank you, Miss Callahan. It's most helpful. Keep your eye on the contortionist, Dot, while I follow up with Mr Forest. I know health center? I am looking for this girl. Anything happen to her? She's my old friend. I need to find her. She rented a room in our house two years ago... and she'd visit me here quite often. She was very nice to me... as if she were my real sister. She said she'd call me from Japan, but... I think she misplaced my number. Otherwise she'd have called. She went to Japan? She said it was for plastic surgery to remove a scar on her body. The day she left, I cried my eyes out. She hugged me and went on about how sorry she was. I didn't even know what she was sorry about. Prepare ten million dollars... and a 747 Jumbo at the airport by 2:00. No mistakes. The Golden Tower was just the beginning. I hope I don't have to use the other nine CTXs. Hello? Hello! Don't put cookies into the bowl. Two of them died today. I am not a fish shop boy. I'm an OP agent, too. You know how many fish bowls we've got here? I don't wanna deal with dead bodies anymore. It's the cookies that killed it. No autopsy is needed-- If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. The soccer game between the South and North... will finally be kicking off at Seoul Main stadium at 2:00 p.m today. With the presidents of two nations present-- Hi. I'm here to collect for the newspaper. - How much? - Seven dollars. It's all right. Bye. What are you doing here? Going to a soccer game? I had four goldfish on my desk... I had four goldfish on my desk... and two of them died today. At first I thought it was the cookies that killed them. But I was wrong. "SU300" inside their bodies... is a high-tech bug that can be used underwater. I suspected my partner these last few days, including you. I planted some bugs here... and got the information that I didn't want to get. From October 1996 to August 1997... when Hee disappeared, you were in Japan. You didn't need a fake passport coming back in... because you became Hyun. Ryu went to Cheju Island to find the truth. What makes me sad is that my buddy... Ryu... loved you with all his heart. Let me ask you this. Did you really love him? Over here! I planted a bug in your car. Will you forgive me? Stay with me! The ambulance is on the way! I messed up. You're going to be okay. You've always been the best! This won't kill me. - Stay with me! The 747's here. Holding position, 100 meters northwest from terminal two. Snipers, make an entry through section D and take position. Their target is the soccer game. They're on their way to the stadium. What are you talking about? No time to explain. The stadium is at stake! They've set CTX around Seoul and want ten million dollars. - They were bluffing. - Why the stadium? All the North Korean leaders are gathered there. Why would they do that? How the hell do I know? Call off the game immediately and evacuate all the spectators. Are you out of your mind? Call off the game? Imagine a CTX going off at the stadium! Go back to headquarters. Don't worry about the stadium. Not even a drop of water can pass through security. - It won't work. Listen to me! You lost your partner today. Go back. It's an order! I understand about liquor, but why not coffee? It's the rule. Sorry. Your attention, please. No beverages will be allowed into the stadium. Thank you for your cooperation. The game will begin in 30 minutes. But what the hell am I doing here watching the gate? How have you been? Attention, please. Both Presidents Kim and Lee... have just arrived! Let's give them a big hand! Get the lights ready. 3-G, Royal Box Section 3-G. Turn them on. Turn the lights on? Who's in charge of the lights? What's wrong? Did you turn on the lights over the Royal Box? Why would anybody do that in broad daylight? They're on now! Check it out. Main substation, speaking. Did you turn the lights on in section 3-G? Yes, there's a circuit problem. I'm working on it. Fix it quick. Today is not a regular day, you know. All right. He'll turn them off soon. Leave right away. This is a restricted area. Who's in charge? Why? You want to turn off the lights? They'll never go out. Hey, friend! You finally made it here. Where's your backup? All at the airport? 011-244-1616. Hello, Dr. Min? It's me, Sik. Can't you hear me? It's me, the oddball! I have a question about the CTX. The CTX! What did you say were the conditions for self-detonation? This will be the graveyard for the corrupt politicians. Not only the politicians, but also innocent people. This is crazy! Sometimes history needs craziness to help it. What do you want? A war! We're removing the barriers for a war. These people are not your barriers. When we're done here our people's revolutionary army will start a war. It's not too late. Turn the lights offnow! That's not what the people of this land want. They don't want another war to kill each other! Revolution always comes with pain. Sacrifices are necessary. There were people who thought the same as you in 1950. Remember the pain that the war caused in this country? I remember very well. What pain the war and separation left us. I'm putting an end to it. This game is to ease that pain! I know it can. We've waited for 50 years under those politicians... but unfortunately, they don't want reunification. It's like we're watching a well-written play. Don't be mistaken. You're not the only one who wants reunification. We have to wait for the right moment. "Our hope is reunification. We dream about it." When you sing this song our people in the North are dying on the street. They barely manage to live with roots and barks. Our sons and daughters are being sold off... for fucking 100 dollars! Have you ever seen parents eating... the flesh of their dead kids? With cheese, Coke and hamburgers... you wouldn't know. A soccer game to unite the nations? It's bullshit. We've had enough with the 50 years ofdeception. We're opening up.. a new history of Korea. The CTX will detonate soon. History will judge us. You know what? The pain you suffered for the last 50 years... came from one person's misjudgment. Stop! Lights off in section 3-G? Turn them off! . Right now! Don't waste your time. Nobody's turning them off. Pull the trigger. Now! Good thing I have company on my way to hell. You know where Hee is? She's in the audience laughing at you. You know where Hee is? She's in the audience,laughing at you. Presidential guards, respond! Evacuate the president! Gate 52, he's on his way to the parking lot. A National Defense spokesman revealed a war scenario attempted by... North Korea's 8th Special Forces. They sent five secret agents, including Park, into South Korea-- Things about oddballs! One. Oddballs revolt like you guys. Two. Oddballs don't like cleaning like you don't. Three. Oddballs chicken out! When'd you first meet her? March, last year. Give me the details. The next day I went to see her. I gave her a CD... and we had dinner together. We talked about music. Didn't you ever feel she was approaching you? Then I wouldn't be here. How were all the fishbowls brought in here? She wanted to put a few in my office for decoration. The agency bought the rest through me. She was pregnant. Did you know that? She never told me. How come? She could have used it to blindfold you. According to our report, you were getting married soon. You didn't suspect her at all dating for a whole year? What do you want me to say? Answer the question. We don't trust anybody... not even the fellow agents you share life with. But she was an exception. It means you admit that you neglected your duty? Agent Ryu is dead. When was the first time you met Hee? It was Hyun, not Hee. Let's call her Hee. You know Hydra? She's a goddess with six heads in Greek mythology. She has multiple personalities with one body. Hyun and Hee... they're totally different. Hydra of our times-- The reality ofa separate Korea turned her into Hydra. This is Pager Voice Mail. You have one new message. Ryu,it's me, Hyun. I am at the stadium. CTX is planted in the lights over the Royal Box. They'll turn the lights on from the substation. I'll be sitting in the west wing of the stadium. Do me a favor. I don't want to face you. Send someone else to get me. The times I had with you... is all of my life. I won't ask you to understand me. Ryu... I miss you so much. I miss you. How have you been? It's you again. Did you meet her? No. It would have been nicer if you came with her. What is this? They're Kissingurami. For me? They're beautiful. If one of them dies... the other dies, too. They dry up from loneliness, right? Don't be surprised.She knew everything about fish. In fact she stayed over here quite a few times. You know how bad she is when she sleeps? I found her under the bed every morning. And when eating... you have to be alert. She's so bad with chopsticks that she throws food on you. Listen to this song. It was her favorite. A Kang Jegyu Film Han Suckyu Choi Minsik Song Kangho Kim Yunjin Directed by Kang Jegyu SHIRI October 1992 Somewhere in North Korea T16, clear! T19, clear! Name: Hee Secret Agent, 8th Special Forces North Korea. Born in 1971 Speciality: Sniper Classification: Confidential OP Agents in charge: Ryu, Lee The list of cases June 1993 - Kim Nuclear-Physics Doctor November 1994 - Cho Nat'I Defense Director July 1993 Gas explosion in Seoul January 1995 - Yoe Strategist at Nat'l Security May 1996 - Kim Staff at Nuclear Submarine TF October 1996 Inchon Port, South Korea U2 U2 Do you copy, U2? U2.... Do you read me? ! It's already been 6 months since Hee went into hiding. Maybe she was taken back due to the risk of exposure. Hi! Hi! I dreamt about U2 last night. He said he'd busted Hee. Goodbye.... You know this song? I don't like music. You know that, don't you? September 1998 Seoul May I help you? I was having a little chat with my buddies. About what? Love. And? They say love's to stay together until the last moment. They know the pain of separation. I bet they do, seeing each other sold off. Have you ever seen fishes cry? How do they cry? Cry in the water, then you'll know how. You're about the same size... as my boyfriend. Have you ever seen fishes laugh? No. It's already been a year. It was raining then, too. You came back the next day to buy a fish bowl with a CD for me. I said, "May I help you..." "Anapus" Yeah, you said "Anapus" instead of "Anabus". "Bus!" A total stranger gave me a CD I really liked. It was coincidental, but you felt so close as if I'd known you for a long time. Did you go to the Alcohol Cessation Class today? The doctor said that I no longer had to come. Take a guess. Ki... Ki... You're unbelievable! They're 'Kissingurami.' Kissingurami... If one of them dies, the other dies, too. They dry up from malnutrition or their scales fall off. Don't let them die. Feed them once a day and change the water... Every 5 days. They don't survive where it's dark and cold. Keep the lights on all the time. I might do the same thing if you left me alone. Kissingurami. Breaking news. Under the slogan of "Reunification of two Koreas," A team of North and South for the World Cup 2002 was launched earlier today. A friendly game will be held on the 25th not only to pick players for the team but to mark a turning point in history where the two leaders of South and North Korea get together. The president of Korea Football Organization said the game would speed up the reconciliation of the two Koreas. Yes? We were supposed to meet. Change of plans. The 3rd floor, electronics. What happened? Not clear yet. Any barrier? Around the third block. Take the outside! Calm down. I'm a secret agent. Dead end on 4th street. Against the wall! Why did you run? She was there. She knew about our rendezvous. Who? Where? He's down! It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Please don't put ashes into the fish bowl. My goldfish smokes, too. Dr. Min, Identified It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Hey, oddball! Lim was the head of black-market weapons dealers. We knew nothing about his organization. When'd he call you? Right before I called you. The perpetrator was there at the same time. Considering the fact that he was hit at the scene he wasn't being followed. Otherwise, he would've been killed before the rendezvous. My life is on the line. I'll tell you the details later but it's about my client who is onto something very dangerous. Let me tell you again. If you don't protect me.... His life was being threatened during the weapons deal. Our priority is to find out who his client was. We went to meet him right after the call. The big question is how'd this client know we were meeting? Autopsy reports came out. What's up? It's Wednesday. Get the smell off the bowl. Don't put cookies into it, then. You can't feed the fish the same thing all the time. From the 1st to 4th cervical vertebrae one bullet went through between the 3rd and 4th and the other penetrated between right and left atrium which killed him instantly. The heart was completely destroyed. I've never seen anything like this before. The former coroner has. Dr. Kim, Director Cho. They're all the same. She's at it again. Goodbye.... Chodo Harbour, North Korea For the Victory! For the Victory! No more corrupt politicians! No more 50 years of separation, disgrace, and humiliation! We're writing a new history of Korea! And the beginning of it is in your hands! I expect to see you all again under a unified sky. Good luck. For the unification. For the unification. Team 4, go! Don't move! Hand's up! He left nothing related to his business. No wonder. They destroy everything that could be used against them. It's hard to find any connection between Lim and Hee. Then, we're back to square one. People around Lim? Lim took care of the business by himself. Nobody knows anything. Hee's been hiding out for over a year. I don't get it. A weapon's dealer was her first target. It's too easy for her. Aren't we overreacting? Could it be a gang war imitating her? Nobody can imitate her. We need to find out what she wanted from him and why he contacted us. What did Hee ask him for? What was the information Lim tried to give us? If she hasn't gotten what she wanted from him yet she'll try to get it through other channels. We need to focus on the fact that North Korea's using her again even though her identity has been exposed to us. You two are the best agents we've got. Finish her at your first priority. What do you think was their relationship? Why'd she approach him? I guess she needed something from him. That's it. That thing she asked him to get her. That's the key. What'd he mean by something dangerous? You look awfully serious. We're late, come on. I got delayed at the beauty parlor. Have you waited long? Not long. How do I look? We'd better hurry. Did you sleep well? Did I snore? I was worried about that. Were you tired? He always sleeps at the theater. I wish you had somebody for times like these. You two are here. He isn't into anything. He doesn't even like to sing or listen to the music. Really? I grew up near the airport cause my old man was a pilot. So I can't tell a noise from a rhythm. Nothing's music to my ears. Then, what do you like? I like looking for people. Lately I've been looking for my ex-girlfriend. What's she like? You want to take a look ? She's cute. Why did you break up? So I can look for her. Gosh, I'm sorry! No problem. Wipe it off with this. Here... I am really sorry. It's OK. It's punishment for dozing off in the theater. Excuse me. When is your wedding day? 20th of next month. When are you gonna tell her? You can't hide it forever. I don't wanna burden her. What if you die on a mission? What about her? I can't, anyway. Why not? You don't trust her? Don't be sentimental. Let me ask you something. If Hee and I point a gun at each other and you have to choose one. Who would that be? Hee, of course. I'd save your ass cause I can bust her later. You don't get many chances. You don't get many friends you'd die for, either. It's not too late, man. You can change your mind. Cheers. I'm all wet! Wait till that stain gets washed off. I've had it. Give me money for laundry. Ask her. I'll pay for it when I do that again. Aim well next time. I'll try. Where are all the taxis? Let's take a subway. In this rain? You're wet anyway. I don't have a girl to take care of me if I catch a cold. Come on, let's run! You sure? It's gonna rain all night long. I like it. I don't think they do. It's bedtime for them. Looks like the rain woke them up. What are they saying? They want us to keep quiet. How are your Kissingurami? They fight a lot. One minute, they hate each other next minute they're hugging, kissing and stuff. They're always like that. When I go out, I get worried about them. If I am not there, you have to take care of them. I don't think I can. I can't even handle 'Kissing' and 'Anabus' at home That's why you have to learn more. To live with them, you have no choice. Your sweater is almost done. I hope it looks good on you. What should I get you for the wedding? All I want is whatever happens to me, you love and never leave me. That's all. Because you're the only one who truly understands me. shiri Step 1 On! On the 17th, 1 million dollars were transferred from Lim's account into Kim's. Kim? He looks most suspicious on the transaction record. Who's he? Nat'l Defense lab researcher. Kim speaking. Yes. Okay. As a part of new weapons system being developed we launched the CTX project last year. If Kim was doing business with the weapon's dealer chances are very high that it was CTX. Tell me more about the CTX. CTX is a new type of energy originally invented by Korea Energy Development Lab we've been working on turning it into a weapon. At first, we had problems with its delicate detonation conditions but the test we did last month was successful. People at your agency know about this, too. It'll bring a sensational change to the military weapon system. How's it different from the conventional bombs? It's a liquid bomb. What's most amazing about CTX is that it's indistinguishable from water. When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color and you can't detect the liquid itself with any devices. Yet the effect is ten times more powerful than any other bombs you've ever seen. What if a black-market dealer got it? He could get the information on it but not the CTX itself. Because you need 3 or 4 approvals to release it. If Mr. Kim took a bribe to hand it over he would've returned the money. Where's it made and kept? That's confidential, sorry. But CTX's never been released until today. How are you so sure? When CTX is released it goes through 3 authorization checkpoints and this morning everything was in order. You're saying it was released this morning? For the weapon show tomorrow, it's being transferred to headquarters as we speak. Sera Mike 1, stop at Dongsan service area. Will Hee turn up? She wants the CTX. She wouldn't miss this chance. Why are they bothering us? They want two secret agents to ride with us. What for? What the hell is that? Sir, We need to check the vehicles. I wasn't informed of this. What's going on? We got a report of a possible interception of CTX. Your permit and ID, please. CTX's safe with us. Get out of the way. Didn't you hear me? I asked for your permit and ID, didn't I? This is Sera Mike 1, we're stopped at a checkpoint. I don't have time for this. I'll fax it to you. If you resist, we'll have to arrest you. What did you say? We'll have to arrest you... or kill you. Are you nuts? I'm fine. Are you out of your mind? You fucking moron! Are you fucking nuts? Wait, look at this. What base are you from? Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea! Sera Mike 1, Do you copy? They've been hit! It's worse than we thought! It's a bomb, run! Hee asked Lim for the CTX and Lim bribed the researcher to hand it over. But when they realized it couldn't be done they planned to intercept it on the road. In the process, Lim and Kim were murdered, along with 20 of our armed guards. How much CTX was taken? About a gallon. It is enough to blow up an entire city. Any leads on the interceptors? Not yet, sir. Just an assumption that they're involved with Hee. But why would North Korea do that in a time of reconciliation? We haven't seen the hidden camera mounted on the vehicle but the gunfire at the scene makes me think that they're highly-trained North Korean militants. Their military system is falling fast. We can't rule out the possibility that they were a private organization wanting the CTX for their own purpose. The question is what are they planning to do with the CTX. If it blows up in Seoul, we're finished. Why not make an official statement to the North-Korean government? Not until we have solid proof. We also need to figure out why their target was the CTX. As you all know, it may explode without the detonator. And no devices can detect the liquid itself. If they utilize those traits, expect the worst. There's no way to predict when, where, or how it's gonna go off. Dinner? I don't feel like it. Is the meeting over? Little while ago. Anything special? Ready to order? Hi! Hi! Beer, please. OK. What about the scene? An inspection of the scene was delayed and the bodies were just taken to headquarters. The film will be handed over tomorrow. Any leads? Just bodies and shells. Isn't it strange? Anything else? This is the third time. Lim, Kim.. This time CTX was intercepted. We went to see Lim right after the call... .. and to the lab right after we got the report. We're always a step behind. It's like they were reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Don't jump to the conclusion. Today we went to the lab without notice. Kim didn't even know that we were coming and he got killed 5 minutes before we got there. If that's the case... it's obvious. Only director Ko and I knew about those killings and CTX. And you made the report. shiri 1's entered. It's been a long time. At 09:00. With sunglasses on. You've changed a lot. It's been six years. How's my family? They're fine. I miss them. Completion is near. You'll meet them soon. A barrier is in the way. Get rid of it. Target? Kissingurami. Finish the job before the completion. Acknowledged. For the unification. For the unification. We're always a step behind. They were reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Hello? It's me, Ho. Can I see you tomorrow? Sure, what's going on? I have a favor to ask. Call me at the Police Agency tomorrow. OK. See you tomorrow. I'll call you. What are you doing there? You scared me! You just got here? No, earlier. I cleaned and did the laundry. Nothing was in the refrigerator. We ran out of coffee so I went grocery shopping. What's wrong? You don't look so good. Just busy at work. Why didn't you call? I was gonna leave soon. Dinner? Not yet. I had a late lunch. Let me fix dinner for us. What are we having? Your favorite. You wanna take a shower? After dinner. I think it's done. Let it simmer. Can you hand me the cloth pins and hangers from the sofa? I couldn't find the pins. It's OK. Leave it, I'll do it. When are you moving in? Soon, I guess. I haven't packed up yet. Let me help you pack up. OK. With you here, it won't be as lonely. You hated eating alone and waking up by yourself. You'll whisper in my ear to wake me up from now on. I'll make the coffee, and you'll play soft music. Should we buy birds? You'd like birds singing in the morning. Promise me that you keep the promise you made to me a year ago. Trust me. I'll never drink again because I have you. A soccer team of South and North Korea returned today to the Seoul Training Center after training in Pohang with North Korean officials coming through 'Panmunjum'. The North Korean President Lee and officials will deliver a message on a permanent peace.... When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color you can't tell the difference from water with the naked eye. But it's a different story with the light on. Turn it on. It's on. CTX responds to daylight over 6000 kelvin. The light alone may start its reaction but without heat, it's no good. Fire. What? Yes, sir. It's on, sir. If you expose it to both light and heat nitro-alpha inside the sphere and beta outside react differently. But when the liquid in the sphere becomes red, the sphere pops. Nitro-alpha and beta combined causes the explosion. How much power does it have? This is about 200cc, so everything within the radius of 1 kilometer would disappear. Since the detonation varies depending on the reaction the sensor here tells you when it's exploding. Like now, if the sphere becomes red it means the explosion is imminent. If you don't stop it before the sphere pops, it explodes. But with either light or heat removed, the reaction stops. I've never seen an agent like you in 20 years. You're an oddball. I am not, sir. Admit it! No, I am not. Admit it! Then I wouldn't be cleaning the fish bowls. Agent Ryu, come to room 17. I gotta go. Find CTX as soon as possible so we can go drinking. We'll find it! Anyone recognizes him? Don't you remember, Ryu? His name is Park. A top agent for the North Korean 8th special forces. When Ryu stormed the plane that'd been hijacked he was the only one that escaped from the plane a painful memory for Ryu. Clear! Hee and Park... All the pieces are coming together. Agent Lee? Find out what's going on with 8th special forces. And you get the daily data of spy satellites from Nat'l Defense. Agent Yoon! Yes, sir. Post Park's montage throughout the country. They're 8th special forces. It's worse than we expected. The 8th special forces intercepted CTX, why? Three possibilities here. First, to sell it off to a third country. Second, to use it on the negotiation table for money or to seek asylum to another country. Third, a strategy they are known for they say they want peace and stab us in the back. It must be either for the money or an explosion. If they wanted the money, why CTX? Robbing the Bank of Korea'd be much easier. Why'd they spoil the peace conference by using the bomb? That's difficult to answer. Hee is key to all this. We don't have time. We'll find a way. What do you see? Can't even tell me? Maybe the solution is much closer than we think. What do you mean? Hee could be close by. Hey, you! What the hell are you doing here? I am looking for the man's room. Are you fucking blind? Didn't see the sign "RESTRICTED AREA"? Hey, you hear me? I sure did. Watch your mouth. Take care. How have you been? Bored to death. I feel more insecure when it's so quiet. I need some backup. What about your agency? The air isn't very clear there. What do you mean? I think there's a leak. This is the only way. It must be very stressful. It'll get better. When do you need it? Tomorrow. I'm coming, too. Sorry, no married man. Time and place? I'll call you. All right, then. Ho! We'll talk later. How's your friend? He'll live. I am glad to hear that. Have a seat. Who else knew you two were meeting? It was very personal. I didn't tell anybody. Lim, Kim, Ho.... Hee is very nearby. There must be a leak. Nobody knows that for sure. Internal affairs are on it. You don't trust your men? Do you trust me? Traps could be anywhere. Maybe there's a hole in the security system but that possibility is almost zero. Don't share the information with anybody. Not even with your partner, Lee. Traps under your feet are hard to see. I'm the Director in charge. I'm Park, of the 8th special forces. I want to talk to my old friend. Thanks for calling me friend. I was gonna send you a coffin, but you were lucky. Disappointed with Hee's shooting. Save it. We can take you out anytime. Maybe I'll take you out first. So, you've become a man. You know where I am? Young drunk kids here yelling on the street.... While people in the north are starving to death. People here have wastes building up in their bellies. What an unfair world. Listen, friend. We have 10 CTXs placed all over Seoul. I'll call you 30 minutes before each of them goes off. You'd better find them before people get hurt. What do you want? Slow down, friend. The first one is on the roof of the Golden Tower. You have exactly 30 minutes. You know the fish named shiri? It's a Korean aboriginal fish, living in crystal streams. Though they're separated with the country divided some day they'll reunite in the same streams. Should I buy some for your girlfriend's fish shop? Why not. Stay alive until then. He's on the move. Clear! Found it! Hyun? Don't tell anybody you're here. Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care of the shop. What's going on? Don't ask. Please do as I say. I don't wanna stay here. Hyun! You haven't touched a drop for a year. This is me. You know that, don't you? What is it? What? You wanna know what? Tell me what's wrong. Dear People of the South Today marks an important and joyous moment in our history. I am here to put an end to years of confrontation and dissension and to open up a new era of understanding. You got a call. Hello? A guy who knows everything about the CTX contacted me. He's Hee's informant, and wants a deal. Where are you? I'm meeting him at the Hwain Cultural Center I'm on my way. Be there. On my way. He's wearing a black jacket and a black cap. Anything else? That's all. I'll be right there. You look good in a black jacket. Anyone else coming? Hee, maybe. So you called me expecting someone inside to leak the information? I hope it worked. Nobody at the agency knows that I'm here. You know it's impossible to tape the phones. So, if they show up I'm the rat? The MSG-90 Hee uses is a 5-shot semiautomatic. She used only two bullets, both for Lim and Ho. In both cases, you were in her range. If I were her I would have used the other three bullets. 3 targets went inside. Acknowledged. Stay in position. The mole must have been found. For the unification! Been a long time. Good to see you. Payback time for the flight 257. Look who's talking. You killed 7 of my men. You left your men behind. Cause I have a job to finish. You wanna know what it is? I'll ask Hee. It's my turn to send you a coffin. Won't be easy! Get back! 'She used only two bullets.' 'In both cases, you were in her range.' 'lf I were her...' '... I would have used the other three bullets.' Name: Hyun Residency: Cheju Island Innate Immunodeficiency Syndrome Admitted at Halla Hospital. Get me Halla Hospital in Cheju Island. Why'd you come here? They ambushed us. OP set a trap. Because you didn't follow orders to kill Ryu. If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. Thanks to you, we lost two of our men! I did what I could do. Yeah, you saved my life. What do you want? You've changed. Of course I have... from Hee to Hyun. Not only in appearance, but inside as well! I don't need a betrayer. We've waited 10 years for this moment. In those hours of pain, we pledged allegiance and buried our youth in the tomb of history. If you want to turn your back on us over personal feelings finish it here. I was stupid... thinking I could be Hyun. But I am just Hee who has to kill her man. I failed to change my inside. Let go! We have a job to finish. Avoid any physical contact with her, and no smoking because her immune system has dropped and make it quick. There she is. with the yellow sweater. Do you mind if I sit here? Sure. Are you from the public health center? I am looking for this girl. Anything happened to her? She's my old friend. I need to find her. She rented a room in our house 2 years ago and she'd visit me here quite often. She was very nice to me as if she were my real sister. She said she'd call me from Japan but I think she misplaced my number otherwise she'd have called. She went to Japan? She said it was for plastic surgery to remove a scar on her body. The day she left I cried my eyes out. She hugged me, and went on about how sorry she was. I didn't even know what she was sorry about... She didn't do anyting to me Prepare 10 million dollars and a 7 47 Jumbo at the airport by 2 o'clock. No mistakes. The Golden Tower was just the beginning. I hope I don't have to use the other 9 CTXs. Hello? Hello! Don't put cookies into the bowl. Two of them died today. I am not a fish shop boy. I'm an OP agent, too. You know how many fish bowls we've got here? I don't wanna deal with dead bodies any more. It's the cookies that killed it. No autopsy is needed.... If this is for my failure, I'll take the consequences. Killing him. It was my personal order. When I met you here, I saw the confusion in you. The soccer game between the South and North will finally be kicking off at Seoul Main Stadium at 2 P.M today. With the Presidents of two nations present... Hi, I'm here to collect for the newspaper. How much? 7 dollars. It's all right. Bye. What are you doing here? Going to a soccer game? I had 4 goldfishes on my desk with 4 goldfishes, and 2 of them died today. At first, I thought it was the cookies that killed them. But I was wrong 'SU300' inside their bodies is a high-tech bug that can be used underwater. I suspected my partner these last few days, including you. I planted some bugs here and got the information that I didn't want to get. From October 1996 to August 1997 When Hee disappeared, you were in Japan. You didn't need a fake passport coming back in because you became Hyun. Ryu went to Cheju Island to find the truth. What makes me sad is that my buddy, Ryu... loved you with all his heart. Let me ask you this. Did you really love him? Over here! I planted a bug in your car... Will you.... forgive me? Stay with me! The ambulance is on the way! I.... messed up. You're going to be Okay. You've always been the best! This won't.... kill me.... This won't.... Stay with me! The 7 47's here. Holding position, 100 meters northwest from the terminal 2. Snipers, make an entry through section D and take position. Their target is the soccer game. They're on their way to the stadium. What are you talking about? No time to explain. The stadium is at stake! They've set CTX around Seoul and want 10 million dollars. They were bluffing. Why the stadium? All the North Korean leaders are gathered there. Why would they do that? How the hell do I know? Call off the game immediately and evacuate all the spectators. Are you out of your mind? Call off the game? Imagine a CTX going off at the stadium! Go back to Headquarters. Don't worry about the stadium. Not even a drop of water can pass through security. It won't work. Listen to me! You lost your partner today. Go back, it's an order! I understand about liquor, but why not coffee? It's the rule, sorry. Your attention, please! No beverages will be allowed into the stadium. Thank you for your cooperation. The game will begin in 30 minutes. If I were in the airport, no doubt I could prove myself. But what the hell am I doing here, watching the gate? Both teams are now entering the stadium. What are you.... How have you been? Attention, please. Both Presidents Kim and Lee have just arrived! Let's give them a big hand! Get the lights ready. 3-G, Royal Box Section 3-G. Turn them on. / Turn the lights on? Who's in charge of the lights? What's wrong? Did you turn on the lights over the Royal Box? Why would anybody do that in a broad daylight? They're on now! Check it out. Main substation, speaking. Did you turn the lights on in section 3-G? Yes, there's a circuit problem. I'm working on it. Fix it quick. Today is not a regular day, you know. All right. He'll turn them off soon. Substation Leave right away. This is a restricted area. Who's in charge? Why? You want to turn off the lights? They'll never go out. Hey, friend! You finally made it here. Where's your backup? All at the airport? 011-244-1616... Hello, Dr. Min? It's me, Sik. Can't you hear me? It's me, the oddball! I have a question about the CTX. The CTX! What did you say were the conditions for self-detonation? This will be the graveyard for the corrupt politicians. Not only the politicians, but also innocent people. This is crazy! Sometimes history needs a craziness to help it. What do you want? A war! We're removing the barriers for a war. These people are not your barriers. When we're done here, our people's revolutionary army will start a war. It's not too late. Turn the lights off now! That's not what the people of this land want. They don't want another war to kill each other! Revolution always comes with pain. Sacrifices are necessary. There were people who thought the same as you in 1950. Remember the pain that the war caused in this country. I remember very well. What pain the war and separation left us. I'm putting an end to it. This game is to ease that pain! I know it can. We've waited for 50 years under those politicians but unfortunately, they don't want reunification. It's like we're watching a well-written play. Don't be mistaken. You're not the only one who wants reunification. We have to wait for the right moment. "Our hope is reunification. We dream about it..." When you sing this song our people in the North are dying on the street. They barely manage to live with roots and barks. Our sons and daughters are being sold off for fucking 100 dollars! Have you ever seen parents eating the flesh of their dead kids? With cheese, coke, and hamburgers... you wouldn't know. A soccer game to unite the nations? It's bullshit. We've had enough with the 50 years of deception. We're opening up a new history of Korea. 4 minutes to go. CTX will detonate soon. History will judge us. You know what? The pain you suffered for the last 50 years came from one person's misjudgment. Stop! Lights off in section 3-G? Turn them off! Right now! Don't waste your time. Nobody's turning them off. Turn them off! We're dying together here. Pull the trigger. Now! Good thing I have company on my way to hell Turn the lights off? You know where Hee is? She's in the audience, laughing at you. 'You know where Hee is? ' 'She's in the audience, laughing at you.' O2, this is O3.... Presidential guards, respond! Evacuate the President! Gate 52, he's on his way to the parking lot. Get out! Nat'l Defense spokesman revealed a war scenario attempted by.. ..North Korea's 8th special forces. They sent 5 secret agents including Park into South Korea.... Things about oddballs! One. Oddballs revolt like you guys. Two. Oddballs don't like cleaning like you don't. I am not an oddball. Three. Oddballs chicken out! When'd you first meet her? March, last year. Give me the details. The next day I went to see her. I gave her a CD... and we had dinner together. We talked about music. Didn't you ever feel she was approaching you? Then I wouldn't be here. How were all the fish bowls brought in here? She wanted to put a few in my office for decoration. The agency bought the rest through me. She was pregnant. Did you know that? She never told me. How come? She could have used it to blindfold you. According to our report, you were getting married soon. You didn't suspect her at all dating for a whole year? What do you want me to say? Answer the question. We don't trust anybody. Even the fellow agents you share life with but she was an exception. It means you admit that you neglected your duty? It's not like you. Agent Ryu is dead. When was the first time you met Hee? It was Hyun, not Hee. Let's call her Hee. You know Hydra? She's a Goddess with 6 heads in Greek myths. She has multiple personalities with one body. Hyun and Hee... they're totally different. Hydra of our times the reality of separate Korea turned her into Hydra. This is Pager Voice Mail. You have one new message. Ryu it's me, Hyun. I am at the stadium. CTX's planted in the lights over the Royal Box. They'll turn the lights on from the substation. I'll be sitting in the west wing of the stadium. Do me a favor. I don't want to face you. Send someone else to get me. The times I had with you... ...is all of my life. With you I was neither Hyun nor Hee but just me. I won't ask you to understand me. Ryu... I miss you so much. I miss you.... How have you been? It's you again. Did you meet her? No. It would have been nicer if you came with her. What is this? They're Kissingurami. For me? They're beautiful. Thanks a lot. If one of them dies... the other dies, too. They dry up from loneliness, right? Don't be surprised. She knew everything about fish. In fact... She stayed over here quite a few times. You know how bad she is when she sleeps? I found her under the bed every morning. And when eating, you have to be alert. She's so bad with chopsticks that she throws food on you. Listen to this song. It was her favorite. Clear Found it! Hyun? Don't tell any body you're here. Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care of the shop. What's going on? Don't ask. Please do as I say. I don't wanna stay here. Hyun! You haven't touched a drop for a year. This is me. You know that, don't you? What is it? What? You wanna know what? Tell me what's wrong.

Bullet entered here, fragmenting at the neck, and losing velocity upon penetration of the Tube down the aorta, continually losing momentum. As it exit ed the aorta, it struck the vertebral column and then was swept down to the base of the aorta where I recovered it here at the lumbar region. (huffs) Pinball. Looks like nines... like we found in the chief. I'll call Catherine. Thanks. Yeah. Hey, Nick. Mm-hmm? You ever been to a swingers' party? Well, if it's the same thing as a frat party, yeah, lots of them. You know, you get enough booze going, things can get pretty wild. Frat party, huh? I wouldn't know anything about that. How wild? Multiple-partner wild. And it'd be no big deal to have two, maybe three Hit on the rock glass. Work card. "Orpheus Hotel. Tiffany Langer." Who's she? Showgirl. Yes, I went to the party. No, I didn't go alone. And, no, I'm not telling you my date's name or anyone else who was there. These people are important. Well, a very important police officer was murdered there. I don't care. It took me a long time to get into the circle, and I plan on staying there. Was there anybody there you didn't know? Anybody who wasn't in "the circle"? Well, my date. Do you know where he is? I haven't seen him since that night. He sent me home with a judge and his wife. So... your date stayed at the party after you left? As far as I know. Where does he live? I don't know. I've known him for five days. Well, that's 120 hours. There must be something you know about him that you could share Right-handed, a Libra, circumcised, rich... Back-East rich. Which kind of surprised me because he wore really cheap cologne. Cheap? How? Smelled funny... sweet. Are you sure it was cologne? Or deodorant. Mouthwash, maybe All I know is it smelled sickly sweet. To be honest, I thought he could have used a little help in that department. Would you happen to have an article of clothing of his by any chance? The only thing he gave me was a good time. Hey, guess what? This isn't about you. This is about a missing seven-year-old girl. Why don't you give us his name? Adam Van der Welk. Uh... no, the chief's little girl is with Child Services. We're still at the drop-off place. Yeah, right. Will do, Brass. I got a pill. Looks like a sedative. Okay. Diazapam. Benzos. That could explain why the mother didn't escape with her daughter. She was incapacitated. Go! How'd the little girl get away? We got some tire treads on the shoulder. Made an easy stop. And why did he pick such a secluded area? Seems like a great place to ice someone. Or take a leak. Maybe that's why he stopped the car here... to take a leak. Run! Run, Sasha, run! Let me ask you another question: When you're home alone, do you lock the I don't even know you. Sure, you do. We all do. It's human nature to avoid being vulnerable, isn't it? So, if that's the case, then he would look for a tree to shield himself, wouldn't he? So, then the question becomes, how far along this path before he loses sight of them? Not very far. Look at this. Bang. Footprints... and this is urine. If you're lucky, urethral cells with slough off with urine. But, if we get his DNA, there's a chance we'll get him. (cell phone rings) Yeah. Caine. What do you mean, FBI? So you're saying the guy has B.O.? Body odor, bad breath. I don't know; there's something about Adam Van der Welk that makes him smell. All this because some showgirl said he smelled sweet? Sickly sweet. Smells can be like fingerprints, my dear. Hey, what's going on there? I thought you were meeting the Feds? Uh... yeah, we are. They picked the place. The Shore Club. Later. What's taking so long? That is a good question. Hey, I just ran into a Fed in the lobby. He told me that, apparently, the Vegas case fits the profile of a serial the FBI's been tracking. Hey, you're from Vegas? Speedle. Brown. Where was the Fed? He's right there in the lobby. He's got his little, you know, headphone on, and his little tie. And you talked to him? Yeah. Do they have an I.D. Yet? No I.D. Yet, but their perp targets wealthy couples at their playgrounds... Pebble Beach, Aspen, the Hamptons. Evidently, the husbands get murdered first and the wives later... after they've enjoyed 48 hours of fun and games. 48? Vegas? Speedle. Willows. That's it? There's also a link to Miami. Of course there is. Or, you know, he could just be some geriatric dude that just digs the weather. I don't understand. Why didn't the Feds put this out on NCIC? Because they're Feds. Excuse me. Dennis. Dennis. Yeah? Tick-tock, Dennis. While you're waiting to get your ducks in a row, the guy with the "Miami link" just slipped through my hands. Horatio, I didn't have federal approval... I need answers for this little girl. Her father's just been killed... maybe her mother, too... and that's your fault. You understand that. It sounds like you're making this personal. Dennis, you don't give me this link, I will make this very personal. All of his victims stayed here in the last year. Here? This hotel? Rittle and his wife, too. Last winter. Mmm. Wish I would have known that. Maybe he would still be alive. Yeah? (speaking Spanish) Si... Vamos. I had a bad feeling about this. What did she just say to you? She just said that you need to learn the language. I don't see this burgundy car. Where you looking? Check the disturbance along the bank and follow it in. How did you find the disturbance? Drive up and down the No, the thing about Miami is the entire city's watched from above. Coast Guard choppers. Someone going to cover me? I got you. Cover you for what? Alligators. Only way to outrun a gator is to swim faster than the guy next to you. Isn't that right, Delko? Used to have a partner. Guys... please? That her? Yeah, that's Mina Rittle. Our guy's still in the wind, folks. Still in the wind. What's her name? Mina Rittle. Who wrapped you, Mina? The plastic wasn't for transport. Covering her intimates... most likely sexual. Two gunshot wounds, left temple. One shot was a through-and-through. Trace ASAP, along with the plastic. My preliminary probe shows water in the lungs, which indicates she was still alive when Looks like the eyes are glued shut. Gold crusty substance underneath. What is that, Mina? The substance is water- soluble. But somehow it got preserved in the water. My guess is the plastic was wrapped around her eyes at Wait a minute. There's a lot more of it. What do you want to bet this is in every orifice? You guys got a sick one. Aha! Delko, you've been down there for45 minutes. Do you know the level of bacteria in the water? You can get all kinds of infections. What do you got? Water pistol. One water logged Beretta knockoff. Suspect's personal gun? That's it. Congratulations. I'll put it over the wires that he's not carrying that Taurus anymore Do that, and take a shower. Nice shoes. Ma'am, you have to concentrate on the face... in parts... not just the whole. Ask me what he wore. Ask me if he was good in bed. Just don't ask me how close together his eyes were. You said he kind of looked like Ricky Martin, right? Yeah, with a touch of Jude Law. Try to not just picture him. Try to think of an event. Okay... Three-way kiss. His lower lip was kind of pouty... and he had this Michael Douglas thing working, you know... - a cleft in his chin. Kind of like that? Yeah. You're right. That is easier. Adam Van der Welk. Little girl saw a monster. Showgirl saw a husband. So this guy could be anybody. Yeah, that's the problem with eyewitnesses. All the more reason to rely on evidence. Tell Warrick hey. Let me know if anything breaks. You, too. Hey. Hey. So, how's your colleague Grissom doing on the aroma angle? I'm sure he's making progress, but Grissom rarely says anything until he's good Smart man. I just wanted to show you something. The sticky substance we got off the wife is, in fact, honey. You say that like it means something. Well, honey on its own is just honey but, when you add plastic wrap, it's... a different situation. (techno-pop playing) (cheering) (crowd chanting) Five... four... three two... one... (cheering) Yum. This is where he got the idea. Yep. Wish me luck. Some guys like to lick it off. Really? I'm partial to the swab myself. Ready, honey? Coming, dear. Tuberculosis victims emit breath that smells like wet leaves. Maple, elm, ash, what? I'm not sure. Miami is pulling cars out of canals, chasing leads, debriefing the kid... and you guys are flip ping through textbooks? This is how I work. Tuberculosis. Cyanide Poisoning. Endocrinology. I'm following my nosino. You're closer to this Van der Welk guy than Doctor. Doctor. How about Darier disease? Doesn't that give you a rash that smells like We're looking for something a little sweeter. There's diabetic ketoacidosis. Body has excess glucose, which converts to ketone... gets expelled through the pore s. Has a fruity smell. It would help if we had a piece of the assailant's clothing. What? I think I overlooked some evidence. I'm going to isolate it using high-performance liquid chromatography. Once we identify the pollen, we'll know if it's floral honey. So, H, when's the last time you were in I was there opening night. I didn't see you there. I was, uh... VIP. What is this? It's Tupelo honey. It's the purest of all honeys. Stays in liquid form for life. Doesn't Where'd you get that? CDC hip ped me to it after that Africanized Okay, let's swap this out. I want you to take a look at this. We got this off the chief's wife. It's a match. It's a match. $500 for five dollars' worth of honey? I don't Those are mostly for decoration but, once in a while, some bigwig comes, Wouldn't it have been easier to put these in order? This is Maybe not. I've got a receipt from two nights ago. Let me see that. Do you recognize this guy? Yeah. Looks just like every other Joe that Look, you work the door. Anybody come in here in the last 48 hours that bought some of that very expensive Tupelo honey? This is Miami. Every night's a weekend. My people tell me that a customer came in two nights ago to Wasn't a customer. It was a limo driver. - A limo driver? - Yeah. Gordon. Gave me a C-note just to double- park. Did this Gordon tell you who he had in the No. Just that it was some rich guy... some Let me guess... from Vegas. Yeah. (siren wailing) How did you find him? Figured, limo driver... airport. I spotted Gordon, here, on Alton... back way to Miami International. Lit him up, pulled him over here. Nice work. You got a last name, Gordon? Daimler. Look, Officer, the Corwins are coming in on their I really should be there. Well, the Corwins are going to have to wait. We understand that another one of your bought some very expensive honey from a Yeah, well, I've had stranger requests. This customer of yours have a name? Never got it. He paid cash. Never saw a Well, did you notice anything unusual about Did he smell? Did he... have an odor? Uh... his breath, maybe. He'd been drinking Remember what he was drinking? Was it Whatever I have stocked. - Well, we'd like to take a look. - Sure. Go ahead. Vodka. Gin. Smell that? Sickly sweet. That's exactly how Grissom described it. You want me to do what? Smell this. That's it. That's Adam's smell. In the five days that you two were together, did you happen to notice what he was drinking? Champagne. Did he ever drink anything sweeter, like whiskey or cognac? Are you kidding me? With him, it was all Dom all the time. You found a medical condition. Diabetic ketoacidosis. It's an insulin deficiency. His body's been expelling excess glucose. Makes him smell fruity. Which, I guess, could easily be mistaken for whiskey breath. Hey, can you test for diabetic ketoacidosis off urine? Well, blood's the best but, if you had a urine sample, maybe. Ask him what medication you would take for that. What would a doctor prescribe? Novalin insulin. Lucky for us we found blood in his urine. Absence of C - Peptide in the blood. Means the insulin in our guy's system isn't natural... it's synthetic. And prescribed. We're right over here. This is our database. Okay, what we're looking for is a patient who's purchased synthetic insulin in the last 48 hours. Here we go. Gordon Daimler. That's the limo driver. That's him. And the reason that old Gordon probably didn't smell when we picked him up is because he'd just taken his insulin, hadn't he? But the scent was still in the limo's AC system. Well, now we have this guy's address. Yes, take a look at this address. A limousine driver with a house on the water in Coconut Grove? I don't think so. Who's the owner of record? Let's check it. Sissy and Dylan Corwin. That's the couple that he was picking up at the airport when we pulled him over. That's right. So then maybe that's how he finds his victims... driving a limo. And, when they're away at some posh resort, he moves into their house, doesn't he? Hops over to Las Vegas. Visits the couple he met in Miami. Kills the husband... Mm-hmm. ...brings the wife back here... kills her. And, when the Corwins come home... not good. No one's answering inside. Miami - Dade Police! Slowly. Slowly. I got a blood trail here... leading to the garage. He dragged her body to here... and put her in that car. Nine-mil. One shot's a through-and-through. Scalp hair. He fired this one first. I don't know. To terrorize her. This strike here. That one's all business. He wrapped her in plastic by the bed, raped her. Then dragged her in here and cornered her like an animal If Gordon's true to form, he's going to kill the Corwins. You guys should take a look at this. Well, people don't really buy these houses for the view. It's a place to put a million-dollar boat. But what's your point? The boat's missing, and that's where he's killing them right now. Speed, get on that thing right now. Put the birds in the air and call the Coast Guard. Right now. Do it. Air and Sea, this is Tim Speedle. I need you to be on the lookout for a yacht... T-45. R.O. Dylan and Sissy Corwin. Commandeered by one Gordon Daimler. Gordon Daimler. Commandeered by... Gordon Daimler. Coast Guard found her adrift! No radio contact! We hailed her. No response. Infrared's up. Blue means dead, red means alive. Pink. Body heat's fading. Person's dying. - Identify the other players. - Speed? Red. Is that our suspect? I'm not sure. I am. How? We haven't identified all the players. He's going back to finish off the job. Detweiler. Getting a bead on him, sir. M.O. On this guy says husband's already He's going back to finish off the wife. You're good to go. Body language does not look like an attack. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Don't the Corwins have a jet? The Corwins have a jet, right? Gordon's left them here to die! Abort this, Sackheim! Abort this! Interstate case. Not your call! Proceed! Stand down! Take him out! Detweiler, I know you want to impress your but there's an innocent man on that boat. Now, if you take this shot, I'm going to be in your grille for the rest of your natural life. I want you to think bout what that might be Think about that. Thank you. Speed, the Corwins have a jet. Find the jet. Call the FAA, and ground the jet by authority of Miami-Dade County. You got it, H. Give us 30 seconds. Then send backup! Mr. Corwin! I tried to save her. It's too late. (sobbing) Get me Fire and Rescue. A few more minutes, sir, we'll be on our way to Monaco. (pistol cocking) Good evening... Mr. Van der Welk. Gordon, did you drive your limo here? He's clean. The Corwins... are my friends. They lent me this plane. Like the lent you their boat? Speak to the pilot. Dylan Corwin called him personally. Directed him to fly me to Monaco. I'd rather call "Dylan" at the hospital to confirm. The husband didn't die. You left us a witness and enough evidence to convict you in two Rich men don't go to jail. You're not rich, Gordon. I'm going to, uh... I'm going to book this guy. You want to go with? Nah, you got it. I'll have my D.A. Call your D.A. (chuckles) Sounds good. Sounds good. Uh... Thank you for your help on this. Thanks for yours, actually. Right. You take care of yourself. I always do. Hey. My mommy and daddy are dead, aren't they? Well, your aunt is flying in to talk to you. That's a yes. I lost someone once. Who? Well... Did you feel sick? Still do. Still do. Sasha... People are going to say a lot of things about your mom and dad, and some of them are going to be true, but what I want you to remember is that they fought like heroes for you. Will you remember that for me? Good. Good for you. Hello. Hey. Nice tan. Nice suit. Yeah, well, I knew you were coming back Yeah. Right. Really. What? Nothing. It's just... unusual to see you dressed like I had to go to the chief's funeral. Missed me that much, huh? [theme music plays] [restaurant hubbub, background music plays] A moment. Don't run away. My friend here, don't let him dry out, huh. - Johnny. - Angie! - How've you been keeping? - As if you didn't know. Look, if you're planning to make trouble-- - You know me. - That's just it. Next time-- No, I had it coming to me, huh? - That's right. - Teach me my place. A woman, she should be in the home. Now I am worried. It's all right. I learn my lesson. - So, what do you want? - A home. Say, a lease on a nice house and £100. - You've got to be joking. - I'd settle for 500 in cash. - What for? - Chance of a lifetime. With that old soak? What's he got? - It matters? - No competition. I told you. I don't want no more razors. Whoever fixed your face did a good job. - Give me a start, huh? - I don't know. What's the angle? Medical. I pay back double in two months. Hang around, I'll see what I can do. - Sorry. - That's all right. Some business. They look after you, huh? - Um-hm. - Another? - I wouldn't say no. - Do you ever? - It's not that I want one. - I know. It's a disease, drink, you know... physiological. Stay with me. I give you all the drink in the world. Starting now. Thanks. - What's your name? - Angie Quiller. Roger Full. How do you do? - I've been thinking... - What about? - This. - Me also. [clattering] Sit up and look good, huh? Don't you take that tone with me, young lady. You're addressing a member of the professional classes. Physicians have been respected members of the community for years. - I am a physician. - Once. And shall be again. With this. Oh, yes, I most certainly shall. One lapse. They'll overlook that in a man - who brings this to the world. - A useless drunk. Physician heal thyself. I shall cure myself, of course. And after? Half a dozen spectacular cures-- Are you mad? You lay a finger on one patient, they'll have you behind bars. - They won't know. - Unless I tell them. Why would you do that? Oh, for God's sake! Because I've got a better idea. You want to prove something? All right. Do it my way, you'll get results. I'll make money, and no trouble with police. - What are you talking about? - Be quiet now, huh. It's yours for a month. Make sure it pays off. And don't say that I don't look after you. You're a lovely man. - What's that? - Capital. You and me, we do business. We are about to found the Full-Quiller Clinic. - I don't understand. - You will. Come, we got work to do. - What's the angle? - Cosmetic surgery. Can't say it sets me on fire. Hardly touches the bulk of our readers. That's how he started. It seems he's been branching out of late. He's treated at least one patient for a tumour. - Malignant? - I don't know. Anyway, the point is he was struck off ten years ago. - What for? - Killing a patient. - Really? - He was drunk at the time. Yes, well, you may have something there, but these articles of yours are tailing off a bit. Look at where you've been placing them. It's a case of which comes first, ducky, isn't it? It's your enthusiasm that keeps me going. All right, go ahead. See how it works out. But remember, we really need a strong finisher. You find out he is pushing some phoney cancer cure and I'll go to town for you. You don't want much, do you? Increased circulation, that's all. [electronic whirring] Hello Control, this is Supernormal 17-- [Control] Yes, Al? I'm getting a rather odd signal from bag number 67 4101 . That the one you lost to another timescale? - Yes, that's the one. - Well? Well, last time I had anything like this, it was one of the kits being used for cosmetic purposes. We took a dim view, didn't we? Yes, that's why I'm querying it now. Of course, it's not necessarily harmful. Depends where it is... on the ethical climate. The signal's intermittent, it's not very strong. - This side of emergency? - Yes, I'd have thought so. All right, leave it on. Watch it though. Will do. Not a mark! I don't think you'll have any further trouble. That's wonderful. I'll tell you, Doctor, when I came to you I had a good many doubts. Yes, people usually do. You see, before I came here, this specialist, as a matter of fact, told my wife it was malignant. I don't think he'll say that again. Surprising how people can slip up, isn't it? Supposed to be a top man, too. I can't thank you enough, Doctor. You've done a wonderful job. Very reasonably too, if I may say so. Now if there's anything I can do, I mean, in the way of recommendation-- - Thank you. - Not at all. - Thank you, Doctor. - Good day. Thank you very much. Goodbye, Doctor. - Another satisfied customer. - Yes. What's the matter? - That growth. It was malignant. - Well? - There's not a trace of it now. - Good for you. I'm beginning to wonder whether we've got our priorities right. - How do you mean? - All this cosmetic work when we could be doing something that really matters. You want to bite the hand that feeds you? We'd never have got started without cosmetic work. You couldn't just put up a plate and go into general practice, could you? - Not then, but-- - Miss Flannery, please. Look, I haven't got time to stand and argue. There's a waiting room full of patients. They're quite happy with us as we are. But that's hardly the point. Let's talk about it some other time, huh? Very well. - Miss Flannery? - Doctor. Please. Now, then, Miss Flannery, what seems to be the trouble? Well, I have this sort of nagging backache. - All the time. - More or less. But not just when you're tired or-- - No, no, all the time. - I see. And how long has this been going on for? Six months, I suppose. You've consulted your own doctor, presumably? - Yes. - And what did he do? She. My doctor's a woman. She gave me some liniment. - No good? - No, none at all. - Did you go back to her? - No. Yes, that's the idea. There's nothing to worry about. Quite relaxed. Twenty, 19. Twenty, 20. Twenty, 18. Sixteen... just a moment. Yes, 16, 20. You have a slightly over-active thyroid, Miss Flannery. Also there seems to be something wrong with your left lung. I don't think it's anything serious but I'd like to take a closer look. Would you mind removing your blouse and lying face-down on the couch? What are you going to do? [electric jingling] You won't mind if I blindfold you for the examination? - Well-- - Thank you. That's it. Thank you. Yes... Don't worry. [high-pitched bleeping] Yes, there's an old tubercular scar down there. I don't think it's doing any particular harm, but a person of your constitution needs all the oxygen she can get. Now if you'd like to lie just perfectly still, yes, right. I'll fix it for you. Instrument nine? Quite still. Good. - Now-- - I hope you know what-- Instrument 30. After this I shall need three CCs of vascular glue. Good girl. Mmm-hm. Yes. There we are. - No harm done. - What? I took out your fibrosis. A good friend it's been to you too. It's walled off the infection, so you're still alive to tell the tale. - You did that? Here? - Yes. - But I didn't feel anything. - And there's no scar either. We may not be able to give you the security of conventional medicine, but there are advantages. I've left your thyroid, you're used to it. Besides, it will probably correct itself once you stop worrying about your job. As for the backache, if you have any further trouble, I would be inclined to see your own doctor again. She could be right, you know. Doctor, there are a lot of questions I want to ask-- Yes, I'm sure, but I don't give interviews. I have a lot of patients waiting for me. But what about my next appointment? You're cured. There's nothing more I can do for you. Well, how much do I owe you? Miss Quiller will take care of that. This way, please. - Oh, and Miss Flannery. - Yes? Look out for quacks. The woods are full of them. - What were you trying to do? - An experiment. Well, don't do it again. You practically gave me heart failure, mucking about like that. - You could have killed her. - But I didn't. - I cured her lung condition. - More by luck than judgement. Don't you see? If you follow the instructions and set the instruments correctly, you can't go wrong. All right. So we got away with it that time. What's the point? I'm beginning to think, with this, we can do anything. - Cure anything. - That's no reason - to chance your arm. - But it is. We must find out. I need to find out. - But to go and operate on her. - She was sick. You don't know who she is. That's what I mean. She could be anyone, a snooper or anything. - She's a journalist. - How do you know? Well, I read the papers. She's a household name, specialises in 'dramatic exposures'. - And you carved her up? - Why not? With your record? Here? You gone mad? Given enough publicity, we may be able to practice real medicine again. What's the matter with you? We've got a nice little thing going-- But what possible harm could she do? She can put you in prison and me back in the gutter. [Miss Flannery] And after that he put these discs all over me. Made out he was getting readings from some dial. - Wonderful! - You've never seen such hokum. Then he blindfolded me. Fiddled about for a bit with some equipment. When he took the bandages off, he told me he'd removed the fibrosis you diagnosed. - No! - And I hadn't felt a thing. I mean, there wasn't even a trace of a scar. And how much did this performance cost? Fifty guineas. You asked for a receipt, I hope. Oh yes, a detailed receipt. Well, you've got to give them full marks for gall. And yet in spite of all that mumbo-jumbo, there was something extraordinarily impressive about him. Oh, these confidence tricksters can be very convincing. That's how they make their living. Oh, I know. I've met enough since I started this series but-- Yes? This was the first time I got the feeling that, well, it was almost as if he believed what he was saying. I don't doubt some of them fool themselves, too. No, I'm putting it very badly. It's hard to explain. He didn't seem to be trying to impress me, somehow. It's very odd. Well, let's judge by results, shall we? Ah, thank you. If this shows what it must, I think you'll really be able to wax indignant - in your final article. - And how! - Good God! - What is it? [nurse] Yes? Nurse, that plate you just brought in. You're sure, it's the one we took of Miss Flannery? - Yes, why? - You couldn't possibly have confused it with another patient's? No. I developed it myself, brought it straight in. Is there something wrong? I just want to make sure. That's all. - It's not possible! - What's wrong? You remember my showing you the fibrosis on that first plate we took? - That's it, isn't it? - Yes, there. Clear as a bell. Now look at this new one. - It's not there. - Not a sign of it. Spontaneous remission? ln the time? Or in a condition as advanced as that? I've never known it happen before. Then what does it mean? There must be some logical explanation. - What? - I haven't the faintest idea. - Then, whatever he did-- - It just doesn't make sense. It makes a hell of a story, doesn't it? You are sure? No question. Your lung's clear. Here... for you. Angie, we can't go on like this. Like what? Running a beauty parlour, more or less. What we've got here... I'm not even sure it should be in private hands. Medicine belongs to the world. Yes, I know, it may sound corny-- What has the world has ever done for us? But it happens to be what I believe. You know what you are? Ungrateful. - Squandering it like this. - We're doing all right. But we haven't even begun to explore its full potential. It's ours. Ours! We came on it by chance and we've cashed in on it for ages. - And why not? - But we've no right to keep it to ourselves. There are people who need it. Really need it. People who are sick. - Don't give me that mush. - We owe it to humanity. And what about me? Don't you owe me anything? Well, yes, yes-- You just remember what you were when I met you. Struck off. A lush. And look at you now. Who have you got to thank for that? This cured me. When I put a roof over your head! Cleaned you up. Clothed you. If it hadn't been for me you wouldn't be here. You'd have lost that by now, if you hadn't pawned it. - Well, wouldn't you? - Probably. Who put you back on the map? Who showed you how to use that? - You did. - That's right. And you think I'm going to let you throw all that away? Just because you want to be a 'proper' doctor? - Where did that ever get you? - All right, all right! Perhaps they won't allow me to use it. No! If we could give it to the... The BMA? The Royal College-- - They'll give you a medal. - It could be of some real good. And what I am supposed to do for a living while you walk around in a holy glow? I told you, we'll think of something. - What? - I don't know. You see? I tell you, let that out of our sight and we are done. Finished! But if Edna Flannery gives us the right kind of publicity-- You can count that out for a start. I cured her, didn't I? What does she say? - Nothing. - But-- They shut her up. Finished the series. There's nothing. Of course... I don't know about 'of course'. It's obvious, isn't it? A quack who kills or maims, well, ah, yes, that's news. People want to read about that. But one who actually heals people... They don't want to know. They don't want to read about it. It's no story. And a good job, too, if you ask me. If she'd only just told the truth... Yes, well, she didn't even get the chance, so let's forget it, huh. Oh, come on. It's not the end of the world. We're not doing any harm are we? We're not doing so bad. You're tired, that's what it is. Tell you what, let's shut up shop for the day. Have a drink, go and get a slap-up lunch somewhere. I'll pay. And after we could... Well, go back to my place, if you like. And... what do you say? We've earned ourselves a bit of fun, haven't we? Thank you. I've got to see somebody. - Who? - See you later. [loudly] Who? [knocking] - Doctor Kelland? - Yes? I'm terribly sorry but there's someone to see you. - Tell them I'm busy. - I have. He insists it's urgent. He won't go away. - Won't? - It's a Mr. Full. That rings a... Yes, show him in. Give me a minute. Get rid of this, then show him in, will you? Yes. All right. Mr. Full, sir. - Mr. Kelland. - Yes? - I'm Roger Full. - Dr. Full? Thank you. I treated your patient, Miss Flannery. - So I understand. - I cured her. - Possibly. - Didn't I? Her condition appears to have improved since seeing you, certainly. On the other hand you're no longer qualified. - I came-- - As a former doctor, you must know that I'm not allowed to consort with a doctor who has been struck off. Even for the good of your patient? Under any circumstances. Yes, well, as a matter of fact, that's why I came to see you. I came into possession of a medical bag. The instruments are different from the ones we are used to and... - ...there's a date on the bag. - What date? 2160. - It could be a patent number. - No, July, 2160. - How did you come by this bag? - I found it. I don't understand, but it works. Well, you've seen the results. It has, well, miraculous properties. How does it work? There's a sort of Diagnostic Card with instructions. If you follow them, it works. Well, you've seen for yourself. - Where did it come from? - Well, I don't know. It sort of materialized. Perhaps some young inventor has found out how to break the timescale. It all sounds a little far fetched-- Well, of course it does. That's why I've got to demonstrate it. You do realise that if it does work, we'll probably take it away from you? - Yes. - You don't mind? Yes, I mind. But it's too much, too great a responsibility... for one man to keep to himself. Too great a privilege. All right. I'll see what I can do, talk to my colleagues. I might be able to persuade them to allow you to carry out an experiment - under clinical conditions. - Thank you. I can't guarantee it, but I must insist on one proviso. - But of course, anything. - If I'm to do this, you must undertake not to use the equipment meanwhile. - I've got myself to think of. - Of course. It's one thing to arrange a demonstration for you. I can't consort with an unqualified practitioner. - Yes. - So no more cosmetic surgery. No more experiments of any kind, or I wash my hands of you. - Agreed? - Agreed. ln fact, you'd better hand over this... this bag to the Royal College for safe keeping. Then I'll see what I can organise - and be in touch with you. - Thank you. - Welcome home. - Thank you. - About time. - I've got some great news. - It'll have to keep. - Our troubles are almost over. There's a patient waiting for you. Cosmetic? - What else? - No, not now. - Why? - Because it's an abuse. Listen, she's loaded. We have a chance to show what we can really do. She's ready to part with good money to lose the bags under her eyes. No, I can't. It won't take you five minutes. But don't you understand? There are people who are really suffering. What makes you think she isn't? I tell you, I'd be suffering if I looked like her. Oh, now, Angie, Angie... You can't disappoint a pathetic, old woman, can you? All right. But this is the last time. Understood? If you say so. Mrs. Coleman, please. Mrs. Coleman, Doctor. Miss Quiller's told me so much about you. Yes, I'm sure. Lie down, please. Thank you. I hope your system is permanent. It is. Right there. Thank you very much. Still. Put the retractors in as I cut. [Angie shushing] [spraying] - It's not going to hurt, is it? - No. Lie back. You know what to do. [sonic humming] Right. [equipment rattling] That's it. And again. Ready? That feels peculiar. Are you sure you're rubbing it properly? Try not to talk during the massage. [clinking] [spraying] - Get her out. - There we are. - Have you finished? - All done. But... you've hardly done anything, surely? Come and see. There's a mirror out in the hall. [Miss Coleman] Oh! But that's wonderful. Simply wonderful! Two hundred guineas for that. Not bad, is it? Money for old rope. She wants her chins fixed tomorrow. You realise we could go over her an inch at a time, at 200 guineas an inch. Angie, we can't keep this up forever. Let's talk about it some other time. I'm tired now. I went to see Mr. Kelland today. - Who is he? - He's Edna Flannery's surgeon. He's going to arrange a proper demonstration for us. - So what? - But don't you see? We'll have a chance to show what it can do. Find out how it works. Perhaps be able to manufacture kits like it. And what will we get out of it? The advantage of knowing that it's in proper hands. That it's being used to its full potential. - That will pay the rent? - Perhaps not, but-- And suppose they don't believe in it? - Well, why shouldn't they? - Lots of reasons. Because they don't understand it, because it might make a lot of them redundant. Oh, now, Angie. Come on. All right! Let them have a look at it, if you must. That's no reason for us to stop using it. If we don't they won't touch it. And I've agreed. You've what? I'm not going on. That's all. I've had enough. Quite decided. You've got a gall. We're partners, aren't we? I've got some say in it. Just because you got all aerated... - All my life I've had it rough. - I know. You know? What do you know about anything? You had it made, didn't you? Posh home, posh house. Medical School. Profession. And what did you do with it? Me? I didn't have nothing. Only this idea that... And, my God, I had to fight for it. And then, one day, I get this on a plate. You... You didn't know what to do with it. I did. I knew. And I've got everything I ever wanted. You think I'm going to stand by and let you just chuck that away? - Poor Angie. - Don't say it. Don't say it or you'll be sorry. Angie, there was a family once. They invented the OB forceps. They were greedy too. They kept them from the world for years. They knew what they were doing. And they were wrong. My mind is made up. I'm going to hand these instruments over to the Royal College. Angie. [clattering, high-pitched ringing] Now look what you've done. A stupid, selfish tantrum. [gasps] [sonic ticking] [buzzer] This is Supernormal 17. This is an emergency. [Control] Let's have it, Al. It looks as if there's been a murder committed with Bag Number 764101 . Isn't that the one you were supposed - to keep under surveillance? - Yes. Is Supernormal Number 18 there? Here. Number 17 is suspended from duty forthwith. You will be responsible for his appearance before the Tribunal. Verify the timescale and kill that bag! Zero out. Massage? My dear girl, what Dr. Full did to me yesterday, not that I'm complaining, you understand. But whatever he did it was not massage. - No, well, you-- - It neither felt like it-- - If you'll just-- - Cut. I distinctly remember him using the word 'cut'. With this? Why not? Look. You see? It simply slips beneath the tissues, tightening and firming the muscles themselves. So much easier than having to work through layers of skin and adipose tissue. It's quite harmless. Comfortable too. [steady beeping] One murder, two murders. What's the difference? For you. That's no reason why I should let them discipline me for disobeying orders. Let me see you do that with your neck. [Control] Kill that bag! [echoing] [loud whirring] [screaming] present: starring: directed by written by M. and A. Zulawski based on a short story by St. Zeromski camera production director produced by Fosca! Wake up! Mr. Fosca! What are you playing, Mr. Fosca? ! My patience has run thin, Mr. Fosca! Have I been nursing a viper in my own bosom so that you could play serenades? I'm kicking you on your sorry arse, Mr. Fosca! You might be fit for the opera, but not for the cinema! My name is Yemilianov. I'm a Russian envoy. If I'm not mistaken, you've just lost your job. That's nothing. I just... sometimes... tara-rara... and... Mrs. Szczebieniew, whose attention you've attracted with your music, has requested that I... Mrs. Sz.... Mrs. Szcz....? I don't accept charity. Is that so? You'll never be able to understand any sensitive feelings. You are an artist and a gentleman... Would you be so kind... and teach me how to play your instrument? Teach you? Mrs. Szczebieniew is bored in Rome. Quiet! Could we start tonight? Allow me to remind you that tonight you are entertaining guests. Guests... The guests won't mind. And this is Mr. Szczebieniew. Zinaida Pietrovna's husband. There you go. Now you can give me a lesson. Now? Here? With everyone present? Are you afraid? Me? Afraid of what? Call a doctor! Do you waltz? You're crying? Never. Are you trying to buy him? Get out of here this minute! Your winnings? Please forgive me. Please forgive us all. I don't need this money. Leave. Go round the house. By the terrace. Wait. It's my first time... I... I haven't, either... You are beautiful. You are like a fairy-tale knight proud shining You are like a young peacock little peacock pavoncello! I didn't know it would be that it would be... so... I did. If you like, we'll run away! You'll stay with me. I'm not rich, but... You don't have to... - Who's there? - It's just me. - May I come in? - No. Why not, my angel? - I've got a migraine. - Again, my angel? Perhaps... perhaps I could give you a massage like last week, remember? - I remember. - It helped, then... - Today it wouldn't. - I see... In that case, good night, my angel. Now I'm in his hand... He just needs to close his fist... Why? My whole family is in his debt. My father, sisters... my mother... Young man! Mrs. Szczebieniew is an exceptionally beautiful woman. I congratulate you. You are drunk. The slave did his job. The slave may leave. Do you recognize these cards? Go ahead. Pick one. Go ahead! Ace of clubs. Queen of hearts. Nine of diamonds. Eight of spades. Jack of spades. Mrs. Szczebieniew is an exceptionally beautiful woman. But Mr. Szczebieniew is a very wealthy man. He married her for her beauty. She married him for his money. Why are you telling me this? Mrs. Szczebieniew's family is... was... in great financial difficulties. On their wedding day, they signed sort of an agreement. Mr. Szczebieniew provided the money on the condition that Mrs. Szczebieniew gives him an heir. As you could see for yourself, Mr. Szczebieniew is a sick man. They decided to spend their honeymoon in Italy in order to fulfill the terms - of the contract. - Quiet! Do you think, you fool, that he will let her get attached to a single lover? You are jealous. Jealous! All this... She is lost. Don't think she is going to accept the likes of you for long. She has tasted... Savored... She became a woman.

One can only endure all this with different eyes... free eyes. Against a taxi, a matchbox... one needs that vision. A didactic oriental isolation.

Why are you looking for him? Girl, you right! You right! It ain't his ass I should be worried about. It should be that bitch. She's the one trying to come on my man. Bitch, you're smart! I'm gonna fuck her up! - That's not what I meant! - That's exactly what you meant! Because that bitch wants to try with me. - I didn't mean that! - I can give pussy, it's called a fucking tuck.

While I'm up in there, girl! Me, bitch! - I wish I never told her. - I heard about that fish. And who the fuck is she? Desiree! Sounds like Desiree. Girl, do you really want to go back to prison? You just got out, mama. I told her that too. He act like prison is a bad place to go. Mama, mama, you are so much better than she is. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Look. My boyfriend, my husband. OK, that's fine. But he's not with you. He's with her. He left you for her the minute you went to jail. - Girl, I am so mad. - Why don't you just stop? - I don't know what else to say. - The only thing I can say is this. Get that motherfucker! SIN-DEE: Oh, girl. Another black boy on a board. They all think they are goddamn Lil Wayne. ALEXANDRA: I remember one Christmas, I was like six or seven, my family bought me the cutest little Barney doll, that I would take with me everywhere. And one day I put it inside the tub with me, - to give it a bath. - Oh, girl, she tried her out. And it just stopped working. It stopped singing the "I love you" song. And I was just so upset. The world can be a cruel place. SIN-DEE: Yeah, it is cruel. God gave me a penis. That's pretty damn cruel, don't you think? You speak English pretty good. Where are you from? I'm Armenian. Yeah, I knew some people, came from Armenia. Brought a lot of jewelry with them, when they got out. They lived on that jewelry, had a restaurant. What part of Armenia? From the capital. From Yerevan. Shit. I'm from Oklahoma, and I am a Cherokee Indian. I got... I got a girl's name, Mia. But, it's a feminine name in English, but it's not in Cherokee. I was named like all Indian Cherokee babies are named. First thing the mother sees when the baby is born she names that fucking baby. So when I was born, my mama looked out the window, and she seen a red bird, flying overhead in the sky. Cherokee Indian name for red bird is Mia Mia. - So, she called me Mia. - (CHUCKLES) If you think that's a girl's name, it's not.

So that was the beginning of it. - After lunch... - You stay with her, okay. I stay with her, we go outside. Next door, to the coffee shop. I get Thai iced teas.

Like ten minutes ago I was driving around. - I was on the phone. I realized... - I've seen it. You know what, sir? I shouldn't be talking and driving the car. That's it. That's it. Why does he owe you money? We made a business transaction. (LAUGHING) A business transaction? OK. This is what's gonna happen. It's Christmas Eve. We'll all go our separate ways. Because I think that's a lot easier than calling our family and trying to explain why we have to be bailed out of jail. What family? (ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING) Yeah. We know.

Iwantto make everybody happy. I'vebeenin thisband for more than half of my life. I am the first, the original old school backstreet boy. Imetloupearlman in 1992. Hewasprobablyone of the wealthiest men Inorlandoat thetime, an entrepreneur. You know he was just From whom? From myself. - What's all this nonsense, Nisha? I've begun to get scared of myself, Rahul. I want to leave.. ..so that I can avoid doing things like the one I did yesterday. Nisha, you haven't done anything of the sort. You were just dancing. Look here.. - Rahul.. ..now we should stop evading the truth. We both know what the problem is. What's the problem? The problem is that.. ..I love you, and you don't love me. Look here, Nisha.. - I know.. ..that you know how much I love you. That night I wasn't sizzled enough.. ..to not hear what my heart was saying. Actually, Rahul, we've become such good friends.. ..that we take each other for granted. So I think that a bit of space will give us time to think. But I'm sure.. ..that when I'm not here, you'll miss me a lot. Then maybe then you'd realize my worth. One thing is certain, that an idiot like you.. ..doesn't deserve a girl like me. And I don't know why, but I feel that.. .. when I come back.. ..you'll be on your knees begging me to get married to you. And who knows at that point in time I may not be in the mood for it. Get lost. Well, maybe you haven't seen your face.. It's better than yours. Hey, Nisha.. - Rahul. Nisha, you're really nice. I know. Come on now.. I must meet everyone on my way to the airport. Come on, Rahul, hurry up. We'll see you. - Bye, see you guys. Take care.. - I'll really miss you. - Thanks. Bye. - Enjoy yourself. Take care. - Bye, Nisha. - Bye buddy. Rahul, has our stuff arrived? Ballu is mad. We haven't been properly introduced. Let's start from the beginning. Hi! I'm Nisha. - I'm Pooja. Now that we are friends.. ..will you forgive me for what I did yesterday? Forgive you? For what? Pooja, what I did with you yesterday, wasn't right. Actually, ever since this place was built.. ..I'm the only one who's danced on this floor. This floor has become my identity. So when I heard that someone else had taken my place.. I felt bad. Without seeing you or knowing you, I was jealous. I shouldn't have felt that way. Had I been in your place, I'd have done the same. Moreover, I really enjoyed dancing with you. You were the one dancing. I was doing something else. I'm really sorry, Pooja. - It's okay Come on, Nisha. The pilot of your flight just called for you. I always told Rahul that there could never be another dancer like me. But I can't say that any more. And I'm sure that.. ..no one can play the role of Maya better than you. Not even me. All the best.. Bye. See you. - Thank you! Bye. Come. Who is coming to drop me to the airport? - Me! Hi. I'm Rahul. You must have heard of me? I'm looking for a special dancer for a special role. I saw you dance yesterday and felt you would be ideal for this. Check, check.. 69.. Ballu, what are you doing? Throw the spotlight properly. Pooja, good, good. But.. I think that you are not opening up. I want to see how Maya looks when she's happy. I want to see the zenith of Maya's passion and love. Okay? Do it again. Okay. Quiet everybody. Take it from the top. Music! Cut it! Cut it! Haven't I told you to forget that you are you.. ..to forget that there are people sitting here? Forget that there's a rehearsal going on here. But you refuse to understand. Pack up. I don't get one thing, Pooja. How I would know which girl was made for me? Will she be holding a placard with my name on it? When I see her, would there be a clap of thunder.. ..and a flash of lightning? "Oh dear, what's happening? I don't really know." "l only hope this does not turn into a tale of love." "Oh dear, what's going on? Nobody really knows." "But if this is a tale of love, then so be it." "Take my hand in yours, as long as you are here." "Let's sit talking, as long as we can." "Let's look into each other's eyes.." "..as long as the night lasts." "Oh dear, what's going on? Nobody really knows." "How do I describe the state of my heart?" "Even the dewdrops seem to burn, with the fever of my heart." "Why do I feel as if someone has caressed me" "Oh dear, what's going on?" "l don't really know." "l only hope this does not turn into a tale of love." "Oh dear, what's going on?" "Nobody really knows." "But if this is a tale of love.." "..then so be it." "Please move away for a while, so I can collect my feelings.." "..and calm the violent beating of my heart." "Let's slow down so that we don't move ahead of time." "Oh dear, what's happening? Nobody really knows." "There is something between us, don't deny it." "And no one know how far it would go." "For you should know, your heart is not what it was." "Oh dear, what's going on?" "l don't really know." "l only hope.." "..this does not turn into a tale of love." "Oh dear, what's going on?" "l don't really know" "l only hope this does not.." "..turn into a tale of love." I hope your uncle would be asleep so I won't have to hear him sing. Bye. - Bye Rahul, I forgot to tell you.. - What? I can't attend rehearsal tomorrow. - Why? Tomorrow I'm going to Khandala. - Khandala? Why? My sister lives there. - Which sister? She's my dance teacher. She taught me everything I know. It's her birthday tomorrow. If I say no, will you not go? I'd go anyway, but if you said yes, I'd go happily. I'm joking. Go on. I'll look into the other jobs tomorrow. Thanks. Bye. - Bye. Rahul's done for. Rahul? What are you doing here? - Hi. I have a friend in Khandala. He's been asking me over for ages.. ..but I've never had a chance to go. And since we can't work without you.. ..I thought I'd meet him, and give you a ride too. As it is you're going alone, so I thought you'd have company. What are you staring at? Hurry up, hop in. If we go early we'll beat the traffic. Come on. Well, why are you smiling? Nothing. Let's go. Today I'm really missing my friend. Really. Tommy, Ceasar, quiet! Quiet! - Pooja, I'm scared of dogs. Pooja, Get them off me. - They won't do anything. Sister's taking a dance class there. I'll just go and surprise her. Stay here. Don't worry, they won't bite you. I'll be back. - Sir Tommy, please. Want some soft drink? You can have these flowers too. Sandhya, what are you doing? I'll give you one now. You've put on so much weight, you can hardly move. No more chocolates and ice creams for you. Get it right this time. Move the neck. Arms straight. You.. Why are you laughing? Shut your mouth. If anyone gets it wrong then no one will watch TV tonight. Don't come begging me again, please sister. Please Sister, let me watch TV. Look. There comes your dear Pooja. Sister, how did you recognize me? There's no need to act smart. I know all my girls from the sound of their footsteps. Happy Birthday to you! What's this? You've brought me another ugly sari. Yes, I chose the ugliest I could get my hands on. Thank you. - Go on, class is over. Where you are going? The class isn't over yet. Now I'm here, and the class is over. You're spoiling them rotten. They behave well all year round. And the moment you step here, they start misbehaving. Sometimes one should be spoilt. No! Sir Tommy, No! - What happened? Tommy, no! - Don't let him go! Nab him! Sister! Wait! He's Rahul, my friend. Your friend? - Yes! Leave him, girls. - Come on, leave him. Tommy, Ceasar, go inside. Go. - Tommy went? They're gone. Why are you so frightened? Hi! Happy Birthday! Ok. - Where are your feet? What are you up to? - I'm trying to touch your feet. Do I look that old? - Not at all but out of respect. Give me your hand. - Pardon me? Your hand. - Yes. Nice to meet you. Oh, you've caught a cold. Come, let's go in. - Yes Pooja please. Save me from the dogs. - They won't hurt you. You don't know. They're very dangerous. - Sister, who's he? I don't know but I'll have to find out. Pooja, you didn't tell me what Rahul does. Rahul? He directs plays. These days, I'm working with him. - I see. I think that you don't like Rahul specially. No, I like him very much. Very much? No, I mean to say, he's a good friend. Good friend? You mean you don't love him. Sister, Rahul's just a friend. A dear friend. I see.. a dear friend. It's not what you think.. ..and in any case, I wanted to tell you something. There's no need to tell me. I understand everything. Stop it, Sister. Sister, you've got it all wrong. Pooja. Pooja. - Rahul. Rahul. Pooja. - Rahul, what's up? - Hi! Hi! - What's up? Nothing. Why are you standing with the spoon? Come join us. Stupid! - Hey everybody! . Come on everyone, follow me.. this way. Okay. Come on. If it's not Love, then what is it? Sister.. honestly! - Look here, girl! I've known you since you were twelve years old. What your heart doesn't let you know, it tells me. The look in your eyes says that you love this boy very much. Now stop lying to me. Understood? Okay? "Just a dear friend". Listen, Sister.. "l can't recollect when this happened." "It's become difficult to hide this secret from everyone." "If you say so, today I'll ask God for something." "Oh dear, what's going on? I don't really know." "What this leads to.. - Let it become a romance." So when is Ajay coming back? Nothing is definite, but he could come at any time. Say D. - D. Say O. - O. Say N. - N. Say K. - K. - Yes. Now say E. - E. Say Y. - Y. - I'll be right back. Alright. Very good. Very good. Let's start all over again. D. - D. Okay, okay. D. O. N. - N. K. - Pooja, give me your hand. - Why? I won't hit you! Give me your hand. Here it is. Here What's this? - Hush. Listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you. Ever since you were a child.. ..you've always put others before yourself. I've always been overwhelmed by your behavior. But today this same behavior has made me sad. But I.. - Quiet! Sometimes, it's very important to think of oneself, Pooja. I see that you are running away from your dreams. You won't let them come true. Don't do this, Pooja. Not everybody is fortunate to have their dreams come true. Don't do this. Let me tell you something. One can fall in Love many times. True love only happens once. The step you're unable to take.. ..Lord Ganpati will help you. He'll show you the right path. He'll give you the strength to fulfill your dreams. Keep Him with you always. I have faith in Him. The Lord will set everything right. I love you, Sister. Stop it! I don't want to make a habit of crying. Pooja! No. No way. You are very fat. Sister will scold me if I give this to you. Why are you frightened? - Pardon me? Why are you frightened of being in love? Tell her. Love and me? I was just.. Okay, give me your hand. Give me your hand. Nice to meet you. Take it! What's this? - This is, in a way, my blessing. I'm very stingy in such matters. I don't give my blessing that easily. But when I saw you I thought that perhaps you need it. This will help you to say what you're unable to say. Keep it very carefully. You get it? - Got it. Bye. - Bye. - She's on her way. If you can't say it, then I'll say it.. - I'll say it. Definitely? - Definitely. Okay. - Okay. Mark my words carefully. Bye! - Bye. Bye! - Good bye, Sister! Bye! - Bye, Sister! Okay! Okay! First, the bride. You can drink straight from the bottle. Okay. Here's to Soni and Jimmy. Everyone together. Cheers. For the most beautiful couple I've seen. And now I'm going to give a speech. Excuse me. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.. May I have your attention, please? Aunty, please.. thank you. Since I am Jimmy's best man.. ..it's my good fortune to make a speech.. ..and it's your misfortune that you all have to listen to it. Till today, I didn't understand how two people can take a vow.. ..to spend their entire lives with each other. I didn't believe in these vows of marriage. And seeing Jimmy and Soni together.. ..only strengthened my conviction. Because there can't be anyone as innocent as Soni.. ..and there can't be a scamp to beat Jimmy. I used to worry that Soni and Jimmy are too different.. ..to spend their lives together. But today, I realize that I was wrong. I'm a little ashamed to admit.. ..that I have started believing in love. The kind of love in which lips don't speak.. ..eyes do. The kind of love that binds two people together forever. And today, I keep thinking of just one thing. I remember something.. ..a very dear friend told me.. ..about God.. ..God has already brought hearts together.. ..but then He left the hearts to find each other. He made us all in pairs. For every one of us, somewhere, there's one soul mate just for us. He made Soni for Jimmy. Today, to that God.. ..I give thanks for bringing Jimmy and Soni together. ..and I pray that.. ..He may give each one of us the ability to recognize our soul mate. Thank you. My bangle? Rahul, have you seen my bangle? Darn! Now I'm sure I won't find it. It was my favorite bangle. - Mine, too. Rahul! Come on, give it to me. Come here and take it. What childish behavior! Give it to me! Come closer. Here goes.. happy? Come closer. Rahul! - Closer.. Stop it! Closer.. Closer.. Closer.. Closer.. Closer.. Closer.. Closer.. "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something." "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something." "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something." "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "We'd rather have died than reveal our secret." "Oh, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something." "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "You were a few steps away from me. I, a few steps away from you." "You were a few steps away from me. I, a few steps away from you." "Yet we may as well have been hundreds of miles apart" "Step by step our wavering hearts came together." "Oh, my love." "Oh, my love" "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something." "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something." "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "Come, you have won me over and I am defeated by my heart." "Come, you have won me over and I am defeated by my heart." "Today, with great difficulty my lips say love." "Now I'm wildly in love.." "..don't ever leave me.." "..don't ever leave me, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something" "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something." "You say something, I'll say something, my love." "We would rather have died than reveal our secret." "Oh, my love." "Oh, my love." "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something." "You say something, I'll say something, my love." Careful. Hey, Suppandi, watch the scenery. Jimmy, watch Soni. What's up, Supandi? Tell me. Oh. - I'm coming. I'm coming. Just do this for me. How much do I work tell me? - Keep this on top. Take it. - Where's Pooja? She's nowhere to be seen. Rahul! The set is ready. Good, well done. Call Pooja. - Okay. Shruti. Call Pooja. - Yes! Pooja, we're ready. Are you angry with me? - Not at all. Then why aren't you speaking to me? I am speaking to you. For three days, I haven't seen your face or heard your voice. I was very busy. I have been calling you every day. Why haven't you been answering? The phone has been out of order for some time. What is the problem? Tell me. I want to know the cause of your restlessness. There's no problem. - There is a problem. Serious problem. The fact is that we both love each other very much. We can't tell each other about it. Today, I've come here to tell you.. ..that I love you. I love you very much. And I know that you also love me. So then, say it once.. ..and that will be the end of your restlessness. Everything will be all right. I don't love you. - You're lying. I'm not lying. - You aren't? Look into my eyes and tell me.. ..that we weren't made for each other. We weren't. Tell me that when I leave you, you don't turn to look at me. I don't. Tell me that nothing happens to you when I touch you. Nothing. - Tell me.. ..that you don't want to come into my arms right now. I don't. Look into my eyes just once.. ..and tell me that you don't love me. I don't.. "For each other." - I don't.. "For each other." - I don't.. I don't.. I don't.. Terrific performance! Very well done! Excellent! Fabulous Rahul! Wonderful. Fantastic. - Thank you, buddy. Rahul, there was no problem with my lighting, was there? Soni, I'd told you. - Nisha! Nisha.? Let's go and give her a warm welcome. - Welcome. Hi. - Hi! Great to see you back again. Hi. - Hi. Oh, Raju, I'd told you she'd come back soon. - Hi. 'But I'm sure that when I'm not here..' '..you'll remember me often..' '..and I don't know why, but when I get back..' '..you'll be on your knees begging me to marry you.' 'And then perhaps I may not be in the mood for marrying.' Well, I'll be off. I'm a little tired. I'll see you all tomorrow. Okay. As you wish. - Bye. What's up with Nisha? - She's tired. She'll come tomorrow. Don't get unnecessarily worried. I'm not a nice girl, Rahul. I'm bad. I'm really bad. No Nisha, you're my friend. And no friend of mine is bad. No, Rahul, you don't know.. ..that I'm not a nice girl. Now you see.. ..I love a boy.. ..and have always loved him.. ..and today I realized that he doesn't love me. He loves someone else. I feel bad.. I'm hurt.. I'm upset. I feel jealous. Rahul, I shouldn't feel like this. I'm bad. I'm very bad. No, Nisha.. - No, Rahul. Actually, that boy isn't just the one I love.. ..but he's also my best friend. Today, for the first time, I saw love in his eyes. I couldn't bring that love in all these years.. ..but that other girl has. Perhaps they are made for each other. Perhaps I was never meant for him. Perhaps her love for him is true. So you see, I should be happy for my friend. I should revel in his happiness. But I'm not happy.. I'm not! I'm very bad.. ..really very bad. Nisha, you're not bad.. ..you're really nice. You know who is bad? He is bad.. The One who plays around with us mortals.. ..making A love B.. ..while B loves C.. ..and C loves D.. I don't know why He does this. When He makes one person love another.. ..He ought to make sure that the other one also loves her in return. Right? But that's not what He does. He's really bad. He's really bad. You're not bad. He's bad. You're right.. It's He who's bad. He's bad! You're bad. I'm not. You're bad. I haven't done anything wrong. You are the one. You are bad. You are bad. You are bad. You are bad. I'm not bad. I'm not bad. - I'm sorry, Nisha. Don't say sorry, Rahul. Else, I'll cry. I'm sorry, Nisha. - Don't say sorry, I'll cry. Sorry. No, Rahul, don't say sorry. I'll break down. Rahul! Ajay.. ..when I was a little girl, you used to tease me about my dreams. When I used to tell you that I am looking for the one meant for me.. ..you would say that I am crazy and silly. You'd say that when I grow up.. ..my dreams will vanish. But you know, I have grown up.. ..and my dreams have not vanished. They have grown with me. That day, at the airport, when you suddenly asked me to marry you.. ..at first I didn't realize what I should do. Then I saw you going. But then I thought, I was crazy.. ..you were my dearest friend.. ..and the one who knew me the most. Who could be better for me? And I was standing lost in my thoughts. You left, and silly me made you a part of my dreams. I started believing that you were the one made for me. And then.. ..and then I met Rahul. You're marrying Pooja? What are you saying Ajay? But Pooja hasn't said anything to me about it. I had forbidden her from telling you. I wanted to tell you myself. Oh, God! I can hardly believe you! I'm so happy! when are you coming? I called just to tell you this. I'm coming tomorrow. - Tomorrow? What can I tell you about Rahul? Where do I begin? Well, you should realize that I've never met anyone like him. Sometimes he's an angel, sometimes a devil. Sometimes crazy.. and sometimes a genius. Sometimes he scolds so harshly.. ..and sometimes he makes funny faces to make me laugh. At times he's more stubborn than a child.. ..and at times he's a beloved companion. In three days? Oh, no. I want time to get things ready for a big wedding. Mom, I don't have time. The company's sending me to Japan for a year. You'll have to wait for eight to ten months. Think about it. I can't wait that long. All right, you come here, and I'll start the preparations. The dreams of your crazy girl have come true, Ajay. She's found the partner of her dreams.. ..and she wants to know whether.. ..she can make all her dreams come true. Can she make her dreams come true? Ajay phoned just now. He's told me everything. He's coming tomorrow, Pooja.. ..and he says to get the wedding organized as quickly as possible. You're a silly goose. You would tell me your smallest secrets.. ..and you hid such a big one from me? Come here.. ..sit by my side. You know, Pooja, ever since you came to this house.. ..I've had a dream in which.. ..one day, you'd become my daughter-in-law.. ..and I, your mother. But I was afraid.. ..of how you two would be when you grew up. Whether you would be friends. Whether you'd take a liking to each other. Hence, I never revealed my heart's desire. I also wanted that.. ..you should decide, if at all you wanted it.. ..but not for my sake. I wanted you to choose Ajay out of your own free will. You don't know how happy I am, for I know.. ..that there cannot be a better girl.. ..than you for my son. Just watch. I'm going to give you a grand wedding. You have no idea how happy I am. May you live long. I want full lights and I want to see.. ..M6 on both left and right of stage. Suppandi, in a while I want to hear the music tracks. Soni, the elevation should be three feet higher.. ..or else the audience on stage right will not know what is going on. When Ballu lights M6, one spot light will filter here on this side.. ..and the audience gets a glimpse of the entry before it happens. Rahul. - Hi Pooja. You just make sure this doesn't happen. I want them in complete.. - Rahul. Sure. Sure. - I'll take care of it. - Yes. I need to talk to you. The show opens in two days, we'll talk later. Shruti. Soni, you just take care of this. I'll see you. Hello. Show me all the costumes of act three's dream sequence. Always sitting with Soni. Never does any work. - That's not so. All are approved? - Yes, this one's approved. Yes. - Trials done? - Yes. - Rahul. Yes. - Rahul, I have to talk to you. Pooja, just a minute. I'll just finish this.. - But.. One minute. One minute. Shruti. Shruti, pay attention here. Okay.. tell me what's the problem? Shoot. Rahul, please try and understand what I am about to tell you. Rahul, Nisha's calling you. There's a call from the auditorium. - Darn. I forgot to talk to her. I'll be right back. Supandi you owe with me.. - Rahul. Where's Nisha? Rahul, please be serious.. Ajay? My name is Ajay, but if you like you can call me Rahul. Fatso! I love you! - Nisha, you'd said.. I really missed you. Remember Pooja, I told you that I'd come to get you anytime any day? Here I am. I came here after meeting mom. She is so elated. Hey, I hope you haven't changed your mind. You're marrying me, aren't you? Have you told your friends? I was going to.. - Hear that! I'll have to do that, too? Come on. I'll tell them all that we are getting married. Ladies and gentlemen.. I'm sorry for the intrusion. You don't know my name. It's Ajay. I'm Pooja's childhood friend. And since she hasn't found a worthy guy.. ..I took pity on her, and I'm going to marry her. Congratulations! - Alright, okay. Thank you very much. Congratulations! - Thank you. Thank you. Okay, okay. In three days, we're getting married. ..and you all must come, with family. Okay. Definitely. - We'll all come. Rahul! Pooja, you're weird. Why didn't you tell us before? We had begun to feel that you were our Maya. We forgot you're Pooja, and you have your own private life.. ..and your own relationships and even prior commitments. We are really stupid! Oh, I forgot.. Pooja, congratulations. Thanks. - And this is.. This is Rahul, our director. Rahul, she likes your name a lot. She likes only the name? - I hope so, man! Congratulations. - Thank you. Rahul, I have a request. - Go on. May I take her away for an hour? - Oh, come on! You're taking her away forever from us. That will be in a ceremonious way. What say, Pooja? This is just a lunch date with Pooja. Do I have your permission? My permission! Now I'll have to get your permission to meet Pooja. Besides, now that you've come.. ..Pooja won't be happy here, will you Pooja? So, go on. I'll get by without you. Are you sure? - Yes, of course! Absolutely! You guys go, and have a good time. Go on. We have his permission.. let's go. - Go on. Okay guys. - Okay, see you. Bye. After three days, okay? - We'll be there. Ballu, show me the final mix. Shruti, show me the sketches. And Nisha, call up the auditorium and tell them.. The thing is that.. ..in two days we're going on stage.. - Rahul! Lights! why aren't you showing me the lights. There are just two days, and you're taking it easy! . Come on, the lights. Shruti, show me the sketches. Quickly bring the sketches here, fast! Tania, hurry up with the band. We've got to finish the music rehearsals, too! Come on, everybody. Faster everybody. Come on. This is our last meeting. I'm getting married tomorrow. I don't want to meet you ever again after today. Just assume that I was never a part of your life. As soon as I start to move, track me with the spotlight.. ..and the other will stay on Pooja. When I get right up to the audience.. ..then slowly dim the light. The show will be over.. The End. That's it. Any questions? I don't want any mistakes, okay? - Okay! Raj, everything all right? - Yes. Okay then, tomorrow be at the stadium on time. Pack up? - I'll take that. - All Right. Hey, Rahul. Something is bothering me. - What? I don't like the end of your story. - Why? This ending's too sad. A love story should always have a happy ending. The audience should come out smiling, right? People like to live in a dream world. They have seen many dreams.. ..now let them see a little reality. Every love story is like this in real life. Full of sorrow and pain. No, Nisha. This ending is absolutely right. There can't be another end to this love story. "l know a girl, when she smiles.." "..it rains." "l know a boy, when he sings.." "..it rains." Jimmy, just go and check the next entry stage left. - Okay. The heart is crazy, just refuses to listen. "Oh dear, what's going on? I don't really know." "I only hope this does not turn into a romance." "Oh dear, what's going on? I don't really know." "But if this is a romance, then so be it." Pooja's last entry is after this. Get her ready, and bring her here. Don't worry. Nisha's getting her ready, and bringing her. Thanks. Don't make this mistake, Pooja. Very few people are lucky.. ..enough to love and to be loved. You can't break the tie which He has ordained. You can't break it. I've spent my years giving love the name of friendship. Now, you're going to spend the rest of your life.. ..giving friendship the name of love. This is a betrayal! A betrayal of love.. a betrayal of friendship. Don't do such a thing! This is our last meeting. I'm getting married tomorrow. I don't want to meet you ever again after today. Just assume that I was never a part of your life. I want to ask you something before I go. Did you ever love me.. ..even for a single day or a single moment? This line is not in the play. - Raju! Tell me just once.. ..have you ever really loved me? Even for a moment? What is Rahul saying? - Shut up. I won't leave without an answer to this question. I'm not going! Did you ever love me, even for a single moment? No. - What did you say? I didn't hear that. No. - Speak up, I couldn't hear. No. - Louder, louder Pooja.. No, I've never loved you. Not for a day, not for a moment. Never. That is all I wanted to hear. Rahul.. you'll remember my name, won't you? What can I tell you about Rahul? Where do I begin? Well, you should realize that I've never met anyone like him. Sometimes he's an angel, sometimes, a devil. Sometimes he's crazy, sometimes he's a genius. Sometimes, he scolds so harshly.. ..and sometimes he makes funny faces and makes me laugh. At times he's more stubborn than a child.. ..and at times he's a beloved companion. What he is or is not, I cannot really express in words.. ..but I don't know why, I feel that.. ..when he looks at me, I feel beautiful. When he laughs, I feel like dancing. When he's upset, I feel like holding him in my arms. When he loves me, my eyes fill with tears. He's made me realize.. ..that I am made for him.. and he for me. I love him very much.. ..not for one day or one moment.. ..but for my whole life. I love you, Rahul. I love you. Yes. Rahul! Now that I've seen them, I believe that someone, somewhere.. ..was made for me as well. Isn't that so? - Yes. My name is Ajay. Yours? I'm Nisha. - Nisha! Are you married? - What? "The heart is crazy, the heart is besotted." "It brings along sleepless nights. It steals sleep and solace." "It shows them the path of love." "It brings joy and tears." "The heart is crazy." "The heart is besotted." "The heart is crazy." "The heart is besotted." "The heart is crazy, the heart is besotted." [ Woman Screaming ] [ Murmuring ] [ Screaming Continues ] The Culann tribe pledges a bond by blood oath... with our new allies. Let neither man nor spirit tear the fabric of this unification. Together we will purge the Roman vermin from our island... and unite in your father's memory, Conor. [ Speaking Gaelic ] [ All ] Through fire with wrath. for our homeland. to the death. [ Woman Screaming ] That's the banshee's wail. lad. Her cry foretells death. - Whose? - Mine. Yours. We don't know. But someone will die, and soon. Through fire with wrath. for our homeland... to the death. [ Banshee Screaming ] [ Man Narrating ] Long ago, at the edge of the known world, the last Celtic tribes were fighting for survival. Europe had fallen to the Romans, and this remote and untamed island... was the final stronghold of the ancient ways. [ Roaring ] [ Conor ] What does this banshee look like? No one has ever seen one. but two nights. two deaths. and the banshee's wail was heard before each. I worry for who might be next. [ Man ] There won't be a next. This is Morvern. His father died last night... at the hands of Roman assassins. After hearing the banshee's wail. This demon has cursed us too long. You're going to hunt it? Burn it to ashes. The banshee doesn't cause death. It foretells it. You agreed to unite against all our enemies. Have you forgotten your pledge? Conor. This is a mistake. We made a pledge. We can't back out now. The banshee moves quicker than the wind. It can't be caught. Then it will be a short hunt. [ Man ] Legend tells us this beast cloaks itself in darkness, and may move as we do. But beware. It can also take on any form it chooses. How do we kill it? With this poison. For my father. I miss my father too. but he wouldn't want this. He wouldn't be here. [ Chattering ] I want the first shot. Take it. [ Banshee Screams ] There it is! Go! [ Chattering ] [ Breathing Heavily ] [ Grunts ] - No! - Oh! - That's a woman! - You heard the wail. - Of a frightened woman. - The druid said it could take any form. Let her speak. Explain yourself. - She's afraid. - She's the banshee. It's the same sound we heard before my father died. - How can we be sure of that? - It can take any form. Stand aside. - What if we're wrong? - Then it seems the banshee calls for you. Perhaps she calls for you. I'm not gonna let her die. It can take any form. She looks like a girl to me. We'll take her. What? If you think she's a banshee. we'll take her. The curse will be on us. Fine. If we see her in our midst again. it'll be your head. You won't. My father is dead because of her. Leave it. Morvern. I don't know. She never told me her surname. Let's see. You were at home with a girl called Sofia, and suddenly-- I go to the bathroom, come back, and she's in Sofia's place. Where's Sofia? Ask Nuria. She's pretending to be her. You don't know her surname? But who do you believe, her or me? Listen, that girl's papers are all in order. We've let her go. - You've what? - And I assure you she's called Sofia. Sofia Cueto, and she lives at number 2, Quiros St. - No! - No, what? Well, yes, but that's another girl. I know the real Sofia. Then tell me where she is. Because, legally the girl you're talking about... only exists in your imagination. - I don't believe this. - And another thing. The girl looks as if she'd been hit. She was in my house supplanting my girlfriend! I don't know why, but she wouldn't press charges. Fucking great! So now she's the victim! Tell me. Are you on drugs? - God! - You were under psychiatric care. My face was destroyed in a car crash she caused! Your face looks fine. Because-- It doesn't matter. I've got nothing more to say. Young man. I'd advise you to see a psychiatrist. Are you an idiot? - What the fuck is this? - What do you mean? If you wanted to fuck her up, there are other ways to do it! - Keep away from Sofia! - It isn't Sofia. It's Nuria! Nuria's dead! Calm down, or you'll be sleeping in a cell tonight! Don't ever talk to me again! I don't know what the cops told you, but Nuria is alive! The cops didn't tell me, Sofia did. Listen, you spoke to her by phone, didn't you? - Let go! - It wasn't Sofia. Nuria can imitate her voice. She took her ID, her apartment. It wasn't over the phone. I've just dropped her home. She looked like this. Nice photo, isn't it? You going to say that isn't Sofia? But that's-- Is this a joke or what? You're crazy, man. I'm crazy? I'm crazy? You're the ones who are mad! You're all mad! Let go of me! God, what's happening? It's my partners, right? They've paid you. This is a plot! Look at yourself. You haven't been right since the accident. Fuck you! Are you saying-- Are you saying this is the girl you ran after the other night? - Is this your ideal girl? - Yes! And you took her. You need a psychiatrist! Problems? I'm in no mood, so just-- There's an explanation for all this. César. Who are you? - You've seen me on TV. - What do you want? I'm here to help you. First of all, it's very important that you calm down. Calm down? You must overcome your fears and regain control. What control do you mean? I'm fine. Who says you aren't? They do. All of them. They think I'm mad. No, of course you're not mad. But what if I told you you were dreaming? No, no, no. Why not? - I know what's real, and this is real. - How do you know? You discover your dreams when you wake. I just know. - My dreams are much simpler than this. - No dream is simple. Look at those people. They seem to be talking about their own business. Completely unaware of you. And yet, they could be there because you wanted it. What's more, you could have them at your complete service... or have them destroy you. I want them to be quiet. And you, too. See? What's going on here? Someone tell me the fucking truth! The truth? Maybe you couldn't take it. It had to be a setup, a big joke to drive me crazy. They all knew. Nuria, Pelayo, the police, the guy at the bar. - Who was he? - I don't know. You said you saw him on TV. On what program? I don't know! I don't know. One that talked about freezing the dead. - Freezing the dead? - Cryonization. Like they did to Walt Disney. Maybe I can help you remember. Is that a threat? Lie down. What's that? A syringe. Relax. My arm's stinging. It's a tranquilizer. What for? These things are all bullshit. If you'd trusted psychiatrists more, you mightn't be here now. That finger, it's making me nervous. You needn't be afraid. - I'm not afraid. - Stop talking and concentrate. Come on. Fuck. I feel dizzy. Good-bye, César. Very good. Now let's see if you can tell me about that dream. - In my dream, it isn't raining. - The office dream. Eli. That's it. I want you to tell me who Eli is. -A secretary. - Eli is a secretary? She tells me to go in. They're expecting me. Who's expecting you? - The Frenchman from the TV. - Sit down, please. It's a contract. - Eli-- - César, who is Eli? You won't regret it. Sign. - What are you signing? - Eli will see to everything. What have you signed? What's wrong? What's wrong, César? Why are you crying? - I'm going to die. - You're not going to die. - I don't know how many. - How many what? - Pills. - You took pills? - How many should I take? - Pills to feel better? I don't want to. When I count to three, you'll wake up. One. Two. I thought that, up to now, you'd told me the truth. What do you mean? You said you took nothing. César, I'll ask you for the last time. - Did you take drugs? - Fuck! Why does everyone-- Stop playacting. Tell me the truth! - I must know what you took. - I didn't take anything! Don't you see? Your brain could have been affected by the pills. - I didn't take any! - You said you did! It's just a dream! Why make it more important than it is? Can't you tell dreams from reality? I can! Really? Don't make me laugh! Bodies that come to life, people who disappear... you, the Phantom of the Opera! Tell me one thing. Do you remember what you did to Sofia? It wasn't Sofia. I don't care who it was. What did you do to her? You remember? My God! What are you doing? I thought you were a burglar. Who are you? I'm Sofia. Sofia. You're not Sofia. César, this will all be over soon. We'll be together again. You'll forget Nuria and I won't be afraid of you. - I'm thirsty. - I'll get some water. Sofia! Yes, César, I'm Sofia. I'm Sofia. I want to see you. I want to see you. I want to see you! I want to see you! At times you dream you're with someone. For example, your father. In seconds, he becomes your mother... and then, the news vendor on the corner. Yet you still feel as if you're talking to the same person. You thought you were at home, but suddenly you realize you're in a school. Or a hospital, or a prison. Dreams are like that. And at times the mind behaves as if it were in a dream. - You know what derangement is? - For fuck's sake! Say I'm stupid if you want, but this isn't derangement! Then what is it? You tell me, because I don't know. I don't know what's in here, or why you killed your girlfriend. I don't know who Eli is, or that man from the TV. - I don't know anything. - That makes two of us. Will you still come after the trial? Don't you hate the sight of me? - What will you plead? - Why do you ask that? The first hearing is next week. Temporary derangement. It's your best chance. Even so, it won't be much use. They won't believe me. Even I don't believe it. What do you believe? I think you're very sick and should stay here for a long time. Don't worry. I'll get at least 20 years. César, you may not believe it, but I care about you. I care a lot about you. Look, kid. Your case interests me. I'm sorry about what's happened. I even thought someone was playing tricks on you, but... I can't and mustn't exceed my duties. - I'm just a psychiatrist. - You don't look like one. - What do I look like? - My father. Preaching at me all day. Your father's dead. There you go. By the way, what happened to that man with the wife and two daughters? I don't know. I never saw him again. Take my advice, get a lawyer. Good-bye, César. Good-bye. ...the main Spanish investment, but certainly the most novel. ...its economic presence in Cuba. ...depending on the era. In the Roman Empire, for example, the normal thing was to live... only 25 years. Who's got the remote? Give it to me! Get it off him! What's up? There's a computer here connected to Internet. They'll only let me use it if you come with me. - Why do you want Internet? - I know what Eli is. Wait! Eli isn't a person, it's a company. - How do you know? - It isn't Eli. It's L.E. They're the initials of an American company. - What are you doing? - Checking the "initials program." It'll tell us all it knows about L.E. Shit! - It'll take ages. - No, wait. Fuck! I feel like I've done this before. A cerebral dysfunction. A lapse in the brain. No, not this time. My God! - That's it. - The photo in your dream? I had to see it before I could dream about it, right? "Cyronics." - Cryonization. - I'll print this. Wait a minute. I don't see what this has to do with your case. The key is in here. Look, there's an office in Madrid. I'll go and check it out. No! I have to go, too. - I can't get you out of here. - I'd be let out under supervision. Make up some excuse. - It isn't easy. - You can do it. You know something else, don't you? I don't know anything. - I've just got a feeling. - What is it? I have to go there, one way or another. Let's get things straight. We're outside, I'm armed. My job is to stop you doing anything stupid. Try anything, and you get a bullet. I've been here before. - This way. - Move. You've got 20 minutes. It's just like in my dream. Good morning. Can I help you? Well, actually, we wanted to speak to Mr. Duvernois. He's my son. He's very shy. Mr. Duvernois isn't here right now. But, first of all, do you know what cryonization is? Well, more or less. Here are some leaflets. You can read them while you're waiting. One of my colleagues will be with you soon. Thank you. "Live without limits. Tomorrow is for the foresighted." What is this? Some kind of sect? "Cryonization is the biostasis or preservation of human beings. It is the bridge to carry our patients to a future... when technology will restore them to life." You pay to live eternally. They laughed at Jules Verne. César, all this is absolutely impossible. What do you know of the future? They promise what the Church has always promised. Immortality. Except they're quacks, not priests. How are you involved? You're not cryonized. You're alive. This is the contract, if you want to look at it. The procedure is very simple. You could die at any time. Today, tomorrow, in 20 years. It doesn't matter to us. At the very moment you're declared legally dead... Life Extension transfers your body to our store in Arizona. There, it's frozen at minus 7 8 degrees. We call that "total suspension," and it costs $240,000. 30,000 pays for the freezing process, and the rest... goes into an investment fund... the interests from which pay for maintenance... and resurrection costs, the day that it's possible. If it is possible. We believe that the reanimation of the dead will be possible. - What's this? - What? Clause 1 4. Artificial perception. It's a concept that we haven't fully developed yet. Look. This is a life. Birth and death. Let's say you've got a terminal illness. Of course you want to go on living, but not in the future. That doesn't interest you. You want to live your life now. Very well. You die, we freeze you... and when we can resuscitate you, we'll have you live... a dream. - A dream? - It will all look real. Your family and friends, your city... the world, even this office. But it'll be a virtual reality. What's more, we'll make you forget that you've died... and that you signed this contract. - How? - Very simple. Wiping it from your memory. You'll live your life linearly, as if nothing had happened. And best of all, you'll live it as you like, as you wish. You'll decide at all times. But what if there were mistakes? What if the dream was transformed into a nightmare? Well, the subconscious can always play a dirty trick. But we're not cowboys. This is a serious company. And virtual reality technology is constantly making huge advances. Look. I'll be honest. Signing Clause 1 4 is like signing for paradise. It's hard to believe. But they laughed at Jules Verne. Excuse me. - Where are you going so fast? - To the bathroom. - Well, not so fast. - I'll go with him. He just felt ill, don't worry. César, calm down, please. This is a dream. It's the only explanation. What he said is impossible. In the 20th century, but maybe not in the 30th. - Maybe not, but we're in 1 99 7. - That's what it seems. - I paid for it to seem like that. - Listen! If this is a dream-- Look at me! If this is a dream, it means that I don't exist! - I just imagine you. - No! - César, I'm real. - How do I know that? Can't you tell a dream from reality? Is this a dream, eh? Tell me, is this a dream? César, I'm wearing myself out over this case. There is no case. I didn't kill anyone. It's all a nightmare. Fuck it, César, trust me! This isn't a dream. - They got it wrong. - Who? I don't know! But they mixed up Sofia and Nuria! I see a face that isn't mine. I'm sick of hearing that! Your face is fine. You're behaving like a child, hiding behind that mask. - Go on, take it off! - I don't want to see myself! I don't care about that. I want to see you. Don't you realize? All that matters is what I see! It's my dream! Say that once more and I'll have you locked up in an asylum. Show me your face. Now. You owe it to me. César, look in the mirror and tell me if you think you're disfigured. God! Why do you keep seeing what isn't there? - You look fine. - I'm a monster! What do you mean? Anybody'd like to have your face. You look normal. Not just normal. You're handsome! César, listen. Maybe you've got something like anorexia. Some girls insist they're fat and end up crazy. César! I want to wake up! I want to wake up! - Hold it! - I want to wake up! Fuck! Shit! - Freeze! - Don't shoot! This is a nightmare! It's a nightmare! You! Wait a minute! You're not to leave! Stop! Wait a minute! It's a dream! It's a dream! Don't move! Drop the gun! - I want to wake up. I want to wake up. - Don't move! I want to wake up! Antonio. Antonio! What? You're crushing me. I'd better not move. I've been shot in the back. How do you know? Well... because-- What's going on here? What the fuck's going on? I told you, it's a dream. Shut up! Shut up! I know what this is. It's one of those Candid Camera jokes. You did a great job, I loved it, but enough's enough! - I see someone. - Where? Up there, on the roof. I can't see a thing. Where are you going? Come on, Antonio. Don't think about it anymore or you'll go crazy. Hello, César. It's time I introduced myself. My name is Serge Duvernois. I represent Life Extension. We met... 1 50 years ago. What? Has the world gone mad? There's no world. It's all in that gentleman's mind. Including you and me. Sure! Shall I thump you to see if it hurts? Try it. They can make you disappear right now, like everyone else. - And who are "they," may I ask? - The company. Life Extension. They know everything we're saying. They know what is going through César's mind an instant after he thinks it. If they can make me disappear, why haven't they done it? It would be virtually incorrect. You've just saved his life. Virtually incorrect? Do you think I'm an idiot or what? No, quite the opposite. You're a great guy. A character who is very necessary for César. A character? - Where are you going? - To look for someone. There is no one. People aren't necessary now. Why didn't you wake me before? You only had to ask. But that was difficult. Because, in theory, you wouldn't know you were dreaming. Since when? Remember the day of the discotheque? That night, when you fell asleep on the sidewalk... was the one chosen for the splice. What splice? The splice between your real life and your virtual life. A splice of 1 50 years which you didn't notice... because you were dead and frozen. From when you woke up... nothing was real. We wiped what really happened from your memory. What was it? You never saw Sofia again. And the doctors were never able to rebuild your face. You woke up on that street with an awful hangover. You shut yourself away for months. One day you learned that we existed. You came to the office, you signed the contract... and then... you killed yourself. I paid for this? I paid for Nuria to come back as Sofia? I paid to look like a monster again? I paid to live this nightmare? You paid to live whatever you wanted. We just provided the setting and the characters. You invented your hell. I tried to warn you in that bar. I said it all depended on your mind. Do I just have to want it? - Can Antonio come-- - There's no one here. They can't have made 4 million people disappear! You've overcome your fears. If you want, we can try again... have you live a wonderful dream... with money, friends, Sofia, or whatever girl you want. You just have to ask. I don't want more dreams. It isn't a dream! César, listen to me. This is real. This man is a sham. Let's go down and look for people. Ignore him. It's logical for him to behave like this... but he doesn't feel anything. I don't feel anything? I don't feel anything? What do you know about what I feel? Ignore him, he isn't real. Yes, I am real! I've got a wife and two daughters. His personality is designed so that he'll say all this now. Where are my daughters? God! César, we can offer you another possibility. In 1 99 7, it was impossible to rebuild your face. But out there, it's the year 2 1 45. You wouldn't believe the things surgery can do. You could wake up... and live in the future like a normal person. - In the future? - You have to choose. How could I wake up? How would you wake from your worst nightmare? No, César, don't listen to him! Your partners set this up! They want you to kill yourself! He's done that. Now it'll just be a formality. - I'm going to do it. - Very well. Do you have any wish before you die? Let them out there read my mind. Who are you? I don't know. Don't keep suffering. It's all in your head. It's all psychological. Come on, César. - What will happen to them? - Don't prolong this farewell. You think they're your friends, but they're just images. That man isn't really crying. - I forgot, I get vertigo. - Then don't look. Good-bye, César. Relax. Relax. Open your eyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Whytellme that dream? Yousaidlcouldtellyou whateverl wanted. Allright. Anything elseyou shouldtellme before westart? Nothingyou don �t know. I wasabout to turn 25. llikedeating, sleeping, making love, like everyone. Andyou know what everyone does when theyget up. OPEN YOUR EYES Where are you going? Out. Stop leaving messages on the alarm. Why? Just don �t. Because it pisses me off. Come on, for fuck �s sake. - I �ll slaughteryou. - We �ll see about that. You �ve got three cars. Why do we always go in this wreck? Come on. I �m in a hurry. Are you backing out? I missed class for this. I �m seeing my partners after. Why do you think I �m dressed up? So you can shout at them. You like that. I don �t shout. - So tell me, did you screw her? - Screw who? Whoever was there when I rang last night. I was alone last night. Anyway, what is it to you? Nothing. You can do what you want with your life. Thanks very much. Let �s change the subject. - Did you screw her? - Give me a break. I was on my own. So, you did. Was it the one you talk so much about? - Who? - That Nuria. My God, I can �t believe it! César seeing the same woman twice! - She must be great in bed. - She isn �t bad. Bastard! When are you going to tell me the secret? - What secret? - The recipe for Coca-Cola. - Look, the kind you like. - Yeah. Change the-- What did you eat today? Nothing. That �s my problem. I �m starved! It �s funny when you ask them what they value most in a man. "I like him to be intelligent, to be honest, to be kind." It �s all shit! You �d have problems ifyou were like me. Not that again! You aren �t ugly. Anybody would like to have your face. You �re normal. - Normal. That doesn �t mean handsome. - You �re handsome. I �m acceptable, when you �re not beside me. You �re like anorexics. They insist they �re fat, and end up crazy. When some girl ties you down, the rest of us will get a chance. - Yeah, yeah. - Why not? Ifyou meet the right girl-- She quickly. I've been sitting right here. - Those our kidnappers? - Well, uh... our broker cooperated, led us to them. Well done. Thanks. - You didn't have to do that. - Credit's overrated. Tangible results. Nice goddamn job. Both of you, really. I told you he'd deliver. - I just didn't think twice on the first day. - What did you expect? The whole team worked well together. Some things could have been smoother, but we'll get there. I'm sure his public defender will have some questions. - It's just a few scratches. - From being dragged through barbed wire. I told him to stop. - Bet you next time he listens. - Come on, fellas. The job's hard enough without tension between the walls. We should be celebrating. Yeah. Nathan, you gotta be kidding me. What am I supposed to do now? - Use the ladies room. - Jesus Christ. Relax. The plumber promised me he'd get to it tomorrow. Try not to destroy that one too. The obvious thing would have been to go Gannon's way. Instead, you got Latigo to do exactly what he didn't wanna do and feel good doing it. Some cases you get an instinct. - I don't get it. How come I haven't heard of you? - It's a mystery. I was thinking... maybe we could serve as partners again. - You know, on a permanent basis. - Wherever I'm needed. So, if I spoke to Aceveda, asked him to put us together, you wouldn't mind? No, I wouldn't mind. Okay, who took my chair? Hey, Lem and Ronnie are psyched. We're gonna go get a beer. Start without me. I gotta take care of something first. Look, I, uh, I talked to both of them, and they're cool about what went down. - Good. - We got Lionel. - Got us a little breathing room. - Yeah. - It was easy, wasn't it? - Yeah. It was a little too easy. My church conducts monthly food drives in Farmington to help feed families. I don't need the gospel. I need work. My pastor knows a lot of people. I'll ask him if someone's hiring. Next time, find some help before you do something stupid. Yeah. - What are you doing? - I'm just letting him know where his family could get some help. If you're gonna get emotionally involved with every collar... get off the streets and into social work. You don't have to tell me about the streets. I grew up on them. Living in them and working in them are two different things. Look, I know I got a lot to learn about police work. And you've got your way that works for you. But I got a way I wanna try for me. Hey. Oh, Jesus. - I didn't know we're coed. - Welcome to the experiment. - I'll be out in a sec. - All right. Cool. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. It was a good day today. Hey, man. So how was it out there? Fine. Yeah. There's nothing like your first time. - I didn't think Gilroy was ever gonna sign off on me. - Don't take it personally. - He was just busy. - Well, I'm glad to be here. You'll like it. Oh, the john's still broke. I'm working on it. - You ready? - Yeah, I'm ready for anything. Good, 'cause we get everything down here. Starting to get a rep out on the street. Bad guys don't like seeing us. It's starting to get fun. Hey, hey. - This here is Terry. He comes to us from Robbery. - Robbery? - We love you, pretty boys from Robbery. - How you doing? Store owner says he heard the shots. He didn't come out to take a look. That make him gutless or smart? –Probably a little of both. –The D.M.V says she had a '96 Ford Escort registered to her. Where the hell are the tech guys? –A knife fight over on Stanton. –Hurry up and wait time. No, no. I'm gonna try the gum again. You'll be back on the tar in a week. Thanks for your support. –Christ almighty, my whole life is going by. –Vic. Huh. Gilroy's in the house. Hey. What brings you to the front line? A car jacking at 2:00 in the afternoon. Yeah, well. Business as usual on the Farm. Look, uh, I wanted to talk to you in person. The... The command of this new Strike Team. –I'm having a hard time selling you to the chief. –Oh, balls! I know the area. I know the players. No one can do this better than me. The chief's not looking for somebody better. He's looking for somebody more... What? What's the problem? He's worried about all your run-ins with Plotkin. –Aw, Plotkin was an asshole. –He was your superior. Yeah, and I've done my penance for a year and a half because of him. –I'm never gonna get another shot? –Not this one, Vic. I'm sorry. No. I need to get out on the street, cleaning it up. I mean, you gotta talk to the chief again. –What? –You can make it happen. Pull a favor. Just get me the assignment. Get me Shane on the Strike Team. –That's another one with a spotty jacket. –Shane's a good cop. And he works well with me. You can fill the rest of the team with whoever you like. Ben, I need this. I've only got one marker to use with the chief. If it use it, I need results. I need them quick... or we're both out of a job. –Just give me the chance. The unit's anti-gang, anti-drug. –Your own team, wow. –I just can't blow it. –You won't. –A lot of O.T. It's more money, but it's less time with you and the kids. We'll manage. You have to do this. –Ben picked you, didn't he? –Yeah. After looking for any reason not to. And he couldn't find one, so show him. Whoa! Can I help you? I'm Detective Mackey. I'm running the Strike Team. We're still interviewing for that position. I hope not. Assistant Chief Gilroy told me I start tomorrow. I figured I'd settle in early. Hit the ground running. Gilroy told you that? Huh. I'm Captain David Aceveda. –You said your name was Mackey, right? –Yeah. I read your file. We have a chance to do something real special here. Well, you let me know how I can help. I don't care how you did it in the past. But in this house, we're gonna work together. Special squads, detectives, uniformed police officers. We'll help each other and share information however and whenever we can. It's the only way that this satellite precinct can work. I'd like to thank the man responsible for our new jobs, Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy. Thank you, Captain. You all know this unit is a trial squad. An expensive one. People say it's a waste of time and tax dollars. I don't believe that. Let's prove them wrong. –Thanks, Big Ben. –Good luck, Vic. Come on, Brent. I remember you. Sofer, uh, you did your P-2 over at Central, huh? –Yeah. –Who sucked you into this hellhole? I couldn't pass up the long hours and the low pay. –You ready, boot? –Yes, Ma'am. –Don't ever call me "ma'am." –Yes, sir. –Just Danny, okay? –All right, Danny. I know you two haven't worked Farmington as much as Shane and I have... so I want you to get out on the street, cultivate C.Is... find out who's hating, who's mating. –Knowledge is power. Cool. When do we get started? Already have. I put a list together of the neighborhood dickheads. We're gonna make some house calls. Let them know who's new in town. This is gonna rock, man. Thanks for letting me join the band. –Might have been a mistake. –Oh, yeah? Who let the guy with the mustache in? –The ladies love the 'stache. –Listen, guys. Trust isn't something that happens overnight. And trust me, where we're going, we're gonna need it. Yeah. Sorry. We... We have a drive-by, gang-related, one fatality. That's you. –We're on. –Let's do it. –What happened? –Yo, man, they killed Wanda. They took Jolene off in an ambulance. –Polly's shot somewhere. –Looks like you got off easy. –Who did it? –Yo, man, I didn't see him. –What's your name? –Ringo. –Parents didn't like you enough to name you after John or Paul? –No, I know Ringo. –Oh, yeah? –Small-time pimp daddy. Who'd you piss off? Yo, man, I was just walkin' with my girls, minding' the store. That's all. I mean in the last couple of days. No one. Someone's trying to mark their territory. Who's the lion? See what you can drum up out of Ringo. I know one of the girls that works for him. Owes me. –I'll see if she can help. –Okay. The classroom's where you learn the rules, but 70% of the job is instinct. Morning, Jules. Black tea, please. You want anything? Uh, orange juice and a breakfast burrito. –I'll take care of that. –That's okay, man. On the house. I appreciate that, but I have to pay. Regulations. –Five bucks. –There you go. Oh, my God. Vic. Can I come in? Sure, yeah. –You taking care of Brian now? –He stays with my mom most of the time. Sometimes she's got this thing like three, four hours though. –And then you're alone with him? –He's fine. I don't fix while I'm watchin' him. One of Ringo's girls was killed today. Another one got shot. I heard about Wanda. She was okay. Uh, any idea who might have done it? Well, you heard it from somewhere else? Lionel Phipps or his guys. –Who is he? –From the neighborhood. Got his hands in drugs. Decided he wanted to get a piece of our asses. Ringo didn't wanna pay the tax. Next thing you know... Stay away from Ringo. He's a walking target right now. That's my mom. Time for me to get to work. If Lionel is the Lion, then what does that make you, his wives or his cubs? Who wants to tell us about the drive-bys this morning? –Stop feeling me up, faggot. –You getting a hard-on, faggot? Bitch ass! Hey, hey, hey! Against the wall! Up against the wall! Man, he's the asshole who started it, man. There's also about a dozen citizens watching us, man. –Just one mistake, that's all it takes. –Look, he's the cocksucker... Who just put himself on our list. But when the time is right, understood? Yeah. I'm sorry. All right. Let's wrap them up and take them home. Get your ass up! –Wagenbach? –Yeah. Hi, I'm Dutch... –You're two hours late. –What? –At Sunset, detectives start at 9:00. –You start here at 7:00. –Yes, sir. I didn't... –You're lucky there's a desk left. That's by the kitchen and the women's restroom. –Is there anything else? –There was at 7:00. Uh, you might as well make yourself useful. A rape victim led us back to the vacant building she was held in. –Detectives Gannon and Wyms are headed there now. –Tom Gannon? –Do you know him? –Not personally. Everyone knows he solved Beachwood Canyon. –I hear he's great. –He's punctual. Managed to loose the ropes, punch out the window with her bare hands to get out. There have been other women here. Vacant building, quiet street. Not much chance of witnesses. Dutch Wagenbach, Farmington Division. Over here, we just call it the Farm. Tom Gannon. I know. Beachwood Canyon Slasher. –Claudette Wyms. –Wyms? –You been on the force long? –Long enough. –I'm sorry. I just haven't heard of you. –Why would you? I like to keep up on my colleagues. Follow the bigger cases. –So, Butch... –Dutch. We got a Salvadorean illegal, doesn't speak English... won't give her name, her parents, just her story. –Which is? –She was kidnapped, held here by three cholos. They called somebody for ransom. Threatened to rape her if they didn't pay. Called back later, family didn't have the money yet, so they went to town on her. After they were done, they tied her up, left. She managed to escape. First one to roll on Lionel gets a free pass. The rest don't. So who's talking? You don't think I'm gonna get Lionel with or without you? Okay. I'll be back in an hour. See who changes his mind. Screw you! I don't think we're looking at typical rapists. Sexual predators are antisocial. They're driven by inadequacy, not money. Our three will have rap sheets, but for violent crimes other than rape. The sexual assault was a punishment to them, not a proclivity. Best desk in the house. Right here by the kitchen, the men's room. –We lucked out. –This isn't an isolated case. Seems like a lot of illegal immigrants have been getting snatched up on the Farm. –Our stats don't show that. –The families don't report it. They just pay. Several people said I should talk to someone named Jesus Latigo. –Who's he? –Well, I don't know, but I got him coming in. –Great. –That's good work, Wyms, but I got you beat. I dug up a witness, says she saw three guys driving off from the crime scene. So I'm running a partial plate. I'll fill in the boss. So, Tom, when you broke Beachwood, what made you think the stepbrother? Something just wasn't right about that kid. His stepsister was all cut up... but he didn't even seem worried about his mother's safety or his two real sisters. –You see, he loved them. –Anyone know what the partner situation is around here? –Captain's still working on it. –Maybe we could work together. I could learn a lot from you. Yeah. Well... maybe it'll end up like that. –When I heard what had happened to Anabel, I was sick. –How did you know her family? –I'm a friend. –Well, we have to talk to them. –See what the kidnappers said to them. –They won't come in. My clients are illegals. You know how it is. –I thought you were a friend of the family. –I am. Are they also your clients? Are you a lawyer? No, no. I'm just a friend. Everyone I talked to said that you're the man to see about dealing with kidnappers. What does that mean? I've really said too much. No, you haven't. Oh, Jesus Christ! Goddamn it. I didn't mean that. I was told this is the ladies room. Oh, I guess it is. Gannon, you creaky old sack of shit. What are you doing? Gilroy asked me to do him a favor and bring a little credibility to this old barn. Barn. I like that. –I heard you're running the Strike Team. –Yeah. –They're giving me the shot. –That's good. Plotkin's probably pissing blood just thinking about it. Have you talked to Joe Clarke lately? –He's enjoying his retirement. –I'm looking forward to it myself. These are my guys now. This is, uh, Curtis, Shane and Ronnie. –Good, as always. –Hey. –What are you working on now? –Some illegal got gang-banged. The victim's more concerned with Mommy and Daddy's I.N.S status... than catching the pricks that spooned her. –Who are you partnered up with? –That black girl and some Dutch guy. –Who? –Come here. Come take a look. I keep hiding his chair on him. –You're starting already? –Every house needs a rube. –And you're anointing this guy? –Oh, yeah. I got the scoop from Sunset. His wife was a big boozer, so he puts her in A.A, thinkin' he's getting her help. And she ends up getting shtupped by her sponsor. And the kicker is she finally tells him not only is she leaving him... she's having this other guy's kid. –Oh, no, no. Maybe we should cut him a break then. Nah. My guy says that Dutch-boy is just a big windbag, needs his sails trimmed. –Doesn't anyone knock? –This one's Wyms. –Hello. –Hello. I got someone in interrogation. –Who? –Why don't you come upstairs and find out? Yeah, I'll be right there. All business. She'll never last around here. –This ain't gonna work. –What do you mean? There's not enough oxygen in there for the three of us. –Fletch, you hang back. We'll tell you how it goes. –Sure. Mr Latigo, this is my partner, Tom Gannon. There's just one cage here, right? –Uh, excuse me. Where did our prisoners go? –The captain released them. –Why? –Ask him. –Captain, I have a question. –Yes? Well, I was just wondering why you cut my prisoners loose without checking with me. I saw the paperwork. It was a mess. There was no probable cause. The D.A wouldn't have taken the case, so I let them go. Maybe you'll remember this the next time you turn in such sloppy paperwork. I wasn't looking for a conviction. I was just sweating' them. It's a holding cell, Detective, not a sauna. It's reserved for legitimate, actual arrests. –They were part of my murder investigation. –What investigation? I haven't seen anything of merit. Where are the suspects? Where are the leads? You sent them off packing. Commanding the Strike Team is a prized position. We had a lot of candidates just as qualified, if not more. So get your act together, or I'll find someone else. Are we clear? Yes, sir. How's the first day going? A few bugs, but I'm working them out. Anything I should know about? Your guy Mackey, he's not off to a very impressive start. –He'll get results. –Maybe. But I'd like to put a backup plan in place. Fill the last open slot with a guy who could... run the Strike Team if Mackey flunked out. Give the man a chance, David. It's day one. I've read his file, called around. A lot of people won't work with him. It's a crucial slot. We can do better. I need this experiment to be successful. –So do you. –Then we need someone who can deliver. He will. Come up with some candidates though, just in case. I'll pick somebody personally. No, come up with a few guys, run them through my office. –You shouldn't have to be bothered. –It's too important. I'm making all personnel decisions around here. Just keep an eye on things. I'll be in touch later. Hey. Heard about your spat with Aceveda. Aw, we're just getting used to each other. No time for a learning curve, Vic. The chief gave me everything I wanted here... but I had to take on Aceveda. He's not going anywhere. Now, do you have leads on this drive-by or not? Hell, yeah. We think this street thug named Lionel is behind it. –Then make your case, and put the Strike Team on the map. –We will. Just might need a little more time. The chief's not gonna have any patience. Which means I don't either. We clear? The people I've talked to say you're a ransom broker. Detaining someone is a heinous crime, but very lucrative in Latin America. –Detain, my ass. You're a goddamn kidnapper. –I'm a consultant. The kidnappers demand a ransom. The families hire me to broker the deal, get their loved ones back safely. –And you do this out of the goodness of your heart? –I charge a commission. I have a 100% recovery rate. –'Cause your buddies are the ones doing the kidnapping. –No. Because I understand how to negotiate with these people. The Salvadoreans do not. Negotiate with what people? Mexicans. They see the Salvadoreans as lower class. They target them. –And what are you? –Honduran. So, look, where are these kidnappers now? I've never met them. We arrange a drop. –How do you contact them? –They page me to a pay phone. –Next time they page you, you tell us. –Look. I'm successful because the families and the kidnappers both trust me. I lead you to these men. All the others will never work with me again. If there were no more brokers, it would be harder to do business... and maybe the kidnappings would stop. –Oh, no. There'll always be kidnappings. And the families will hire other brokers who don't care. Brokers who take the money and keep it. And the kidnappers will kill the victims. And the broker says, "That's just the way it goes." Well, I care. I pay the money. I get people back alive. Look, are you gonna lead us to these guys or not? I can't. –Talk to me. –We wait a couple of weeks. We wait till one of Lionel's guys slips up on some felony. –And then we flip him. –We don't have a couple of weeks. Lem and I spoke to Narcotics and Vice. They've been trying to make a case against Lionel for months. They're at a dead end. –They have nothing for us? –That's what they said. God! We gotta nail him, like right now. Okay, so we keep at him. We hit him long enough and hard enough, he'll get the message. You an expert on making guys long and hard? Hey, this isn't funny. I mean, it's the goddamn first day, and the bosses are already talking about making changes. Anybody here feel like going back to their old post? Huh? Look, I hate to say this, but, uh... I think we need a shortcut. Like what? Maybe we need to squeeze a guy in Lionel's outfit, make him produce some evidence for us. That'd speed things up a bit. Produce as in plant? Hey, we all know that this guy's an asshole in the first degree. It's for goddamn sure this isn't the first body he's responsible for. –I don't know, man. –You just hear me out. A high-profile bust gets us credibility out on the street and with the bosses. Once we get our feet on solid ground, get a couple of wins under our belt... we go back to doing it the right way. Hey, we need this. Just this once. Hey, where we goin'? Ain't no police station this way. Yeah, well, we a mobile unit. Why you in such a hurry to go to jail anyway? Bringin' me in for a couple of joints, man? I ain't doin' time for no three sticks of chronic. With your record, I wouldn't be too sure. You're gonna help us build a case against Lionel. Are you on the pipe? –You see that? –We had our own tagger do some work. We're the new king of this jungle. –You think painting' a snake on the wall makes you top dog? –Wanna go back for possession? You guys may be the cops, but Lionel's the law around here. You gotta bring it a lot heavier than this to change people's minds. –I don't think he's gonna cooperate. –Give it time. –If he doesn't? –I'm thinking. You know what? Screw Rondell. We'll just try another homie. –Lionel will catch wind of it. –Can't stake him out. He's smart. If we bring him in for piddley shit, Captain Ass will just kick him. Why don't we get a warrant based on suspicion of the shooting? We drop the evidence ourselves. Lionel will scream "setup." And that's exactly what it will look like. –It can't even remotely appear like we brought the shit in. –No. No, we've gotta have another cop find it. How about planting it in his car? Crib's the best bet. When's it empty? It isn't. He's got girls streaming in and out of there day and night. We don't need you to tell us when they call. –We'll just wait, get the page ourselves. –No, they use a code. Without me, the number won't make any sense. I tried to interrogate our victim again. She still won't talk. They don't trust the police. That's why they come to me for help. I do this community a service. It's not just about the money. I help families pro bono... Cut the champion of the people crap. –So what happened? –Mayfield Duffy... pushed a cart full of groceries out of the store without paying. When my husband went to stop him, he got attacked. –What did he hit you with? –A bag of ice. –Go call the paramedics. –Mayfield is okay. He just had a bad run. No work. –He said he will pay for the stuff later. –I told him we don't do that. No money, no groceries. Look, I don't wanna get Mayfield in no trouble. I just want the money or the groceries back. Well, sir, he committed a felony. We're gonna have to arrest him. Well, then go do it. He took perishables. –Yeah? –Step out of the apartment, please. –You Mayfield Duffy? –Yeah. –Step down, please, sir. –Hands out of your pockets, sir, and behind your head. –What's the beef? –Turn around. –I told him I'd pay him. –Before or after you struck him? –Is Otto okay? I didn't mean to hit him hard. –Yeah, he's okay. Second set of cuffs. You know there are places where you can go for aid, sir. –I got aid. Then I got robbed. –Robbed? I get food stamps twice a month. That punk gangster in 29... keeps breaking into the mailbox and stealing everybody's food stamps. It will be days before I can get some more. Meanwhile, my family's starving. What am I supposed to do? Not commit a felony. –Use this purse. –It's got a false bottom and a remote mike inside. –What's that, coke? –Crack. The sentencing is more severe. Give me your purse. Come on. I want you to go inside Lionel's apartment. You tell him that you're willing to pay a street tax... to stay out working and stay safe. –I don't even know this guy. –He knows about you. You hide the crack in his bathroom, under the sink or something. This is the guy who shot up Wanda? It'll be a pleasure then. Hey, hey. You're miked. We can hear everything. If at any time the mike fails, we'll be in there, okay? –Okay. –Listen. This guy is bad. If it seems dangerous, you just say the word "gringo." Then we come riding to the rescue. –Gringo? –Yeah. Right. Hey. I mean it. Any sign of worry, you say the word. –You Happy Sandez? –Yeah, that's me. What of it? You the same Happy Sandez that's been breaking into people's mailboxes... stealing their food stamps? –Food stamps? –I don't need no ghetto coupons. –Happy, we got your sheet, man. You got three priors for theft and no job. Why don't you give those people their food stamps back so they can eat? I'm missing the game. I tell you what, Happy. My partner and I are gonna go around the corner for exactly two minutes. And when we come back... either the food stamps you took are sitting on that bottom step... or I'm gonna call some detectives down here... and they're gonna turn your life upside down. You got it? You got two minutes. Screw Ringo. I'm willing to pay you. –I don't wanna get shot up. –Smart thinking', sweet pea. –So are we cool then? –Nah, not quite. See, I like to know what I'm puttin' on the streets. Come here. Right here. –He wants to taste the kitty. –Sure. –Just let me run to the bathroom. –What for? To pop in my diaphragm. No need, baby girl. I ain't hitting that raw. –Oh, yeah. –Oh, God. The broker is a pipeline, but he's decent. If we talk to him the right way, he'll talk. That broker is a dead end. I got my witness coming in. I think she's our best bet. You know, I got 30 years experience says... if we slap this broker with obstruction of justice... he misses one home-cooked meal, he'll talk. –Tom's got seniority. Follow his lead. –The witness is here. –Hi. I'm Detective Gannon. Thanks for coming. –Carry on. So, uh, hypothetically... how would you go after the broker? The boss wants to do it Gannon's way. And he's going his way. Doesn't mean we can't go ours. They teach you that in the classroom? Goddamn, you're tight. Oh, God. –You ain't gonna dis me again, right? –No, I swear. Right? –I'm going in. –Hey, hey, hey. She didn't say gringo. –I'm going. –Hey! We don't have a warrant. And we're only gonna get one shot at this. All right? I don't care. Hey, God-goddamn it! Hey, hey, hey. Come on, man. Hey. She's a pro. This is what she does for a living. We gotta make this case, right? Right? –Oh, for God's sake. –Hey, Vic, Vic, Vic. Come here. Come here. Hey, look. We're almost there now, right? All right? It's in the bathroom, under the sink. God. Vic, I'm okay. Vic. I need to score before you take me home. –Nice digs, David. –Nice enough. You don't sound too excited. No, I am. It's just... Gilroy's stocked the pond with his own fish. I'm still figuring out what waters are safe to swim in. I could use a friendly face working here. Is this gonna be like the time you tried to get me to work Narcotics in the Valley? –It'll be different. –How? You'll say yes. –I'm happy in Robbery. –This is more money, more action, more fun. –So what's the job? –Gilroy's pick for the Strike Team, Vic Mackey. There's a spot on the team. Take it. If Mackey doesn't work out... you'll take his place. –Run the Strike Team? Even if he does work out, it's still a great gig. Come on. It's a no-lose situation for you. Your boy's going down tonight. The question is are you going down with him? Lionel's got drugs in his crib. –Lionel don't keep drugs at his crib. –I guess he got sloppy. Makes me wonder. You ever get sloppy? You wouldn't. Aw, shit! So we busted Rondell here on possession for distribution. –He wants to deal now. –What can you offer us? –My boss, Lionel. –We think he did the drive-bys. I made deliveries to his house. He's got product there. You gotta move on him right away though. –And you're willing to swear to this in an affidavit? –Sure. Whatever it takes. Detective Vendrell, let's take his statement. Call for a warrant. –Impressive. –Thanks. Getting him to roll on a heavy hitter... for a misdemeanor marijuana charge. I can't take all the credit. I don't think he fully grasps the distinction between felony and misdemeanor. When that paperwork comes in... I'd like to go on that bust with you. See you in action. Sure thing. Your pager just went off. I know we don't have much time. –Sorry. I'm bound by tradition. –This tradition... does it always include multiple rape? –No, that was wrong of them. What if the kidnappers decide the family owes them money? They could go after her again. They probably will. I see how you're being honorable. You tell me how they're being honorable. Look, if you helped us though, if you led us to them, it would be a message to them... that the brokers are not the only ones who have to follow by the rules, so do the kidnappers. Your community would understand that. They could appreciate the honor in it. Informant? Yo, who the hell told you I got drugs? That's confidential for security reasons. –I'm sure you understand. –Yo, don't play me, dog. –I've got a right to face my accuser. –You can mention that at trial. Hey, yo, man. Take it easy over there. Hey, you heard the man. Respect the property. Got something. Whoa. How many years of experience in this room... and the goddamn rookie finds the brick on his first day. –Let me see that, man. –Nice. Yeah, damn straight. The kid's a natural. –I taught him everything he knows. –I'll bet you did. Yo, that ain't mine, man. This is a stone-cold setup. –You put it there. –Found it under your sink, sir. –Well, this is a goddamn setup, man. –Vic, Vic. –Check this shit out. –That's a TAC-9. It's the same kind of gun used in the drive-by. We plant this too? Yo, look. I didn't shoot nobody. Is that what ballistics is gonna tell us about that dead hooker? I didn't think so. –I have 10 minutes to get there. –We better hurry. Just get in the cage. –Good work, Vic. You know, you really pulled it together. –Thanks. The chief's happy. He wants another press conference to trumpet the quick results. –I'll do most of the talking, but he wants you there too. –Sure. Detective. We got a call from our kidnappers. We set up a drop. You mind getting our backs? The captain said we could help each other out. Hey, my day's just getting started. Shut up! Get down. Stop! Get back here! Stop, goddamn it! –Down. Hands behind your back. –Where do you think you're going? You got him cuffed? I said stop! Goddamn it! All right, we're secure here. –You all right? –I got him. Keep looking. –That's them. –Which ones? Those ones. Hey, what happened? Latigo had a change of heart. –You didn't tell me that. –It happened quickly. I've been sitting right here. –Those our kidnappers? –Well, uh... our broker cooperated, led us to them. Well done. Thanks. –You didn't have to do that. –Credit's overrated. Tangible results. Nice goddamn job. Both of you, really. I told you he'd deliver. –I just didn't think twice on the first day. –What did you expect? The whole team worked well together. Some things could have been smoother, but we'll get there. I'm sure his public defender will have some questions. –It's just a few scratches. –From being dragged through barbed wire. I told him to stop. –Bet you next time he listens. –Come on, fellas. The job's hard enough without tension between the walls. We should be celebrating. Yeah. Nathan, you gotta be kidding me. What am I supposed to do now? –Use the ladies room. –Jesus Christ. Relax. The plumber promised me he'd get to it tomorrow. Try not to destroy that one too. The obvious thing would have been to go Gannon's way. Instead, you got Latigo to do exactly what he didn't wanna do and feel good doing it. Some cases you get an instinct. –I don't get it. How come I haven't heard of you? –It's a mystery. I was thinking... maybe we could serve as partners again. –You know, on a permanent basis. –Wherever I'm needed. So, if I spoke to Aceveda, asked him to put us together, you wouldn't mind? No, I wouldn't mind. Okay, who took my chair? Hey, Lem and Ronnie are psyched. We're gonna go get a beer. Start without me. I gotta take care of something first. Look, I, uh, I talked to both of them, and they're cool about what went down. –Good. –We got Lionel. –Got us a little breathing room. –Yeah. –It was easy, wasn't it? –Yeah. It was a little too easy. My church conducts monthly food drives in Farmington to help feed families. I don't need the gospel. I need work. My pastor knows a lot of people. I'll ask him if someone's hiring. Next time, find some help before you do something stupid. Yeah. –What are you doing? –I'm just letting him know where his family could get some help. If you're gonna get emotionally involved with every collar... get off the streets and into social work. You don't have to tell me about the streets. I grew up on them. Living in them and working in them are two different things. Look, I know I got a lot to learn about police work. And you've got your way that works for you. But I got a way I wanna try for me. Hey. Oh, Jesus. –I didn't know we're coed. –Welcome to the experiment. –I'll be out in a sec. –All right. Cool. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. It was a good day today. Hey, man. So how was it out there? Fine. Yeah. There's nothing like your first time. –I didn't think Gilroy was ever gonna sign off on me. –Don't take it personally. –He was just busy. –Well, I'm glad to be here. You'll like it. Oh, the John's still broke. I'm working on it. –You ready? –Yeah, I'm ready for anything. Good, 'cause we get everything down here. Starting to get a rep out on the street. Bad guys don't like seeing us. It's starting to get fun. Hey, hey. –This here is Terry. He comes to us from Robbery. –Robbery? –We love you, pretty boys from Robbery. –How you doing? ⬄25000÷1000⬄ Philadelphia 1976 You can barely tell. I'm flying. Good as new. Look. Todd's sick of me. So maybe you're sick of him. Let's go back to Tim's room. He's cooler than any of them. You really want to? Maybe later. You're not supposed to have people here. Who says? Your mom and dad. You're gonna call them in Jakarta? Give the lady a beer for her silence. Is Jill coming? What do you think? I saw her today. She said maybe, maybe not. Please. She's coming. Who's gonna clean this up in the morning? Go watch TV, Bonita. There she is. Oh, hi, gorgeous.

Á¦·11Ì ·¡Ä¡Æ÷�å( �Ð o£¶óæ�) ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON CBS: 2003/09/28 You writing? Yeah. How you doing, Detectives? Trash still here, chairs on the floor. They hadn't closed yet. Eight years on the line, never had a triple. Last out gets the action. This an overnighter? Kid who opens up found this morning. Looks like a straight robbery? Go talk to the scene man, kid. Register's raided. Let's get it dusted. It's a bad case of death. All three shot. Her throat's cut. Doer's got a gun. Why's he gotta slit her throat, too? Um, Detective? When you dust the register... We might find your prints? That's why we keep our hands full. All right, I'm knocking on some doors. We boring you in here? Stillman called. There's a civilian down at Central, wants to talk to you. Me? Asked for a lady in Homicide. I hear you were in the Badlands. Della's Chicken and Ribs. What's the deal with this civilian? Civilian? Probably some nut job. Vera said that he, uh... I told Vera to deal with her. I've been on since midnight. I got three murders to solve, and he's pawning his dog calls off on me? I know, Lil. He is one pain in the ass, boss. Yeah, look, she's right outside. Just chase her demons away. Your triple's not gonna go anywhere, all right? You better give Vera some hell. Like it would do any good. Detective Rush. Homicide. You do murders? I investigate murders. I want to tell you about one. What's your name? Bonita... Bonita Rafaela. You been smoking some pot today, Bonita? It helps with the pain. I've got cancer. Sorry. I saw a murder. A girl was killed on a tennis court. Where's the court? Chestnut Hill. At the house where I used to work. The boys were having a party. He hit her... over and over and over and over. You didn't call the police? I went to bed. I thought it wasn't my business. A girl dying wasn't your business? And when did this happen? In 1976. 1976, Bonita? 27 years ago, and you're just telling this now? I had a son. I needed to work. But now I have this cancer. Something die in here? Whew... These cases. The timing adds up. Jill Shelby, beaten at a neighbor's house, found the next morning. Case was never solved. Yeah, like the rest of these job. But now we got a witness. Are you saying we should open a 27-year-old case, Lil? There's new direction. Yeah, witnesses from that long ago are gonna be pretty shaky. Maybe. But then, time can be on our side. People who wouldn't talk then might be willing to now. Look at this maid. Mm-hmm. I mean, time passes. People's loyalties and circumstances change. Do you believe this maid? Yeah, I do. I don't know the assigned detective. Britt. I bet Jeffries does. Britt was top shelf. Got killed in Camden trying to pick up a fugitive. So he's not the reason the job went cold. Uh-uh. And I remember this one. It made him crazy. The girl's mother would come in year after year, Britt never had anything for her. who'd he look at for the doer? The two brothers, one being the boyfriend. A live-in cook made the list. And, of course, some folks thought a gang of black kids must have come to Chestnut Hill that night. The boyfriend his top pick? Yeah, it was rumored he had been violent with her. Todd Whitley? Oh, yeah. Cocky little jerk, as I recall. From a society family. No one would talk about those boys. The old man was too powerful. Put up walls Britt couldn't even get past. Someone should read the job again. Maybe those walls are shakier now. How about you? I got a job. But Vera might get a sense of achivement out of it. You spoke to the maid, Lil. Only 'cause he stuck me with her. This job deserves another look and Vera doesn't have the type of personality to get anywhere with society people. You give Vera my triple, you're gonna find him in Della's freezer. Excuse me, is Evelyn Shelby here? I'm Evelyn. Hi. Lilly Rush. How'd you find this house? Well, I'm a Detective Homicide. Is it about someone who stayed here? No, um... it's about your daughter. A witness has come forward in her case. Someone who worked in the neighborhood. So you don't know anything. We have new direction. Look, I came into Homicide every August, for over 20 years. Eventually, I figured out that Detective Britt was too much of a gentleman to tell me to stop coming, that her case would never be solved. You can only hope so long. So I should just forget about Jill? How about Todd Whitley? Should I forget him, too? Todd was lovely to Jill. Really, I... hear he knocked her around. What's lovely about that? I still see Todd Whitley... and Melanie. They're married now. Melanie... Jill's best friend? They became close after she died. And I'm not interested in stirring up more accusations against him. Well, I'm reopening the case. I'm not saying don't do your job. It's just that no one's been able to solve it after all these years. And... and I-I just can't get pulled in again. What kind of person doesn't wanna solve her daughter's murder? Someone in a lot of pain? Well, she won't help me with Todd, she thinks he's a golden boy. And the best friend's married to him. That's a tight inner circle. So Jill's own mom isn't on board, who's this for? You working a dead case instead of our triple? Talk to him. Unsolved isn't dead, Las. And she's got direction. Don't you? Yeah, but I also got three murders at this restaurant. All right. Who else can you go to on this? Well, not Melanie. So I guess that leaves the brothers. What was their party line on the abuse? The party line was don't talk to the cops. Going out on the street, boss. Right. Neighborhood survey on Della's. You coming or not? Let me just work this one for one more interview, then I'm back. Great. All right, what's your play with the brothers? Well, Todd's a superstar lawyer now. Eric is more of a fringe case. Divorced, drinking problem, doesn't exactly work. Sounds like he's your first stop. Eric? Yeah? Detective Rush. I'm heading out. I have a meeting. There's a 1:00 in Old City. It's not that kind of meeting. Oh. Um.. I'm.. It'll just take a few minutes. It's about Jill Shelby. You were in school with her, right? Chelsea Day? I can't talk to you. How come? They treated my brother and me like suspects back then. Well, it was an open secret Todd was hitting Jill. He loved Jill. People hit people they love. I shouldn't say anymore. Maybe you could just tell me what she was like. She was nice. When you were alone with her, at least. When you weren't alone? I don't wanna speak ill of the dead. It's okay. I hear it every day. She'd ignore you. She ignore you that night? She was at her worst at parties. I see dollar signs, already, Charlie. That was a $50 value. Thank you! Come on, Jill. Tell us what a kiss from Eric's worth. I can't. He's Todd's brother. You've already kissed two other guys. I'm not into it. Come here, Eric. So she was kind of a bitch to you that night. She didn't mean it. That was the just way she got sometimes. Mmm. Anyway, I need to go. Oh, did you letter in high school? You look kind of athletic. One year. Wrestling. Todd Whitley. Lilly Rush. Have a seat, Lilly. Who'd you row for? Uh, Chelsea Day and Penn. I'm still on the water most mornings. Impressive. This is about Eric I assume. You don't seem too shocked he might be in trouble. Patterns of behavior, right? Recognize her? What is this? A homicide investigation. Look, that was painful for a lot of people. I suggest you leave it alone. I can't do that. It's an open case. Why did someone like you become a cop? Oh, bad education, limited talent. You should be married, living the good life. Well, no one ever asked. So here I am working a homicide. Well, as I told the cops at the time, I was with my brother all night. Actually, a lawyer told them that in a statement three weeks later. So? Look... my father owned half of Philadelphia. People like to see families like ours in trouble. We hired a lawyer. Maybe your kind of people don't do that... mine do. Even if there's nothing to hide? I can't help you anymore. I understand you're married to Melanie now. She can't help you either. Do you still have a problem with violence? I know you once hit Jill hard enough to give her three stitches and all. Everyone knew the cops had it in for me over Jill. They were wrong then, you are wrong now. Ever hit Melanie? All right, Lilly, you're right. Someone did beat the crap out of Jill on a regular basis. But It wasn't me. Her father was a real son of a bitch. You sure know how to find people. I thought you'd still be living in Chestnut Hill. I like the city. Did you find something? Autopsy records and medical records. And? I just don't understand these injuries Jill had before she died. Injuries? Broken rib when she was 12.... a concussion ... a jaw fracture at nine years old. What's the deal? She played field hockey and soccer. Uh-huh. She was very active. Evelyn, my ex-husband was a mean drunk. I know the difference between a soccer injury and a trip down the stairs. Did your husband beat your daughter? He was in Houston the night she died. That wasn't my question. He's been dead nine years. And now you work at a Shelter for battered women and children. Where did you get that? The case file. I took this picture. I don't see how you can just forget her, Evelyn. Forget? I think about her every day. This ruined my life. Then it still matters. I can't look back. It's too hard. So you sell your Chestnut Hill house, pack up your old life and-and think you can just walk away? You can't walk away from her, Eveylyn. She's a part of you. There's now hope now. And what if you don't solve it? Where does that leave me? What if I do solve it? My husband doesn't want me talking to you. Todd doesn't want you helping with your best friend's murder investigation? I thought we put this to rest. It's important to me, Melly. So you came to the party with Jill but left alone? I drank too much. I had to go home and I couldn't find her. You made a big point in your interview that you were sure it wasn't Todd. The detective made a big point of asking about him. He was fixated on the Whitleys, but barely looked at Tim Dorn. This is the cook? He lived in our guest house, and he was with the girls that night. When we left for the party, he told Jill she should come by later if she wanted. When I heard she was missing the next day, Tim was the first person I thought of. All this information and I got one page on the guy the mother and best friend think did it. You gotta listen to the best friend. Teenage girls tell each other everything. Well, Britt wrote two sentences on him, then blew him off. It's hard to tell if he even worked him hard enough. Especially when he had it out for Todd. Dorn's up in Frackville. Locked up? Why do you think he's gonna talk to you? I'm an optimist. Lil, I got a wife at home. You don't have to come. You think it's a dead case. Let me just call her. Five years for forgery. I got a facility for it, gets me into trouble. You ever dabble in more serious crime? Like the violence done to Jill Shelby? No, Ma'am. I'm strictly a cerebral criminal. Pretty attractive, wasn't she? She was pretty cute, for a girl. You did tell her to come over that night. She came over a lot to get high. She and her little vixen friend Melanie. Well, that little vixen thinks that you killed Jill. Well, if you marry the prime suspect I guess you better point to someone else. Jill's mom also thinks you did it. A woman lives in a certain world. If the shining neighbor boy killed her daughter, that world's a lie. Britt has your alibi down here as going to bed at 10:00. I guess he must have kept his word. Actually, I was with a... friend that night. What friend? Bobby Jordan. This big, luscious college boy down the street. Neither of us was exactly out and proud at the time, so we asked Britt not to document the sleepover. Bobby's gonna confirm that? Well, I imagine he's come to terms by now. Did Jill ever talk to you about Todd? Oh, sure. Those girls told me everything. Like what? Teenage drama. They even told me things they didn't tell each other. Like all the while Jill was fretting that Todd doesn't treat her right, Melanie was doing him on the side. You can't be here. Gate was open. My partner, Chris Lassing. How you doing? Todd is furious at you. Uh-oh. Thanks to you his brother came here last night, drunk, after six years of being sober. Eric did? Look, I've told you about Tim Dorn. Why do you have to keep bothering us? Dorn's alibi checked out. We know about you and Todd stepping out on Jill back then. I... I don't have to talk to you. We have to arrest you? You don't want that, Lady. You should see our holding cell. Your headband will get all dirty. Why does this matter? 'Cause when you tell us one lie, Melanie, even if it's small, that makes us think you're hiding other things. Like whatever Todd did to Jill that night. It wasn't Todd, okay? I know... because I was with him that night. That is some top. It's new. You look like, uh... What? A patriotic street walker. It was in Seventeen. Why do you have to be a jerk? Why don't you go and comfort her? You know, you could use some time in charm school. Could I? I could give you a tutorial... upstairs. What about Jill? What about her? I'm obviously not proud of it. It sounds like Eric had pretty strong feelings for Jill. So? So, why'd he fall off the wagon just 'cause Jill's name came up? Two million people in this city, I gotta run into you? You think I'm thrilled seeing you? All right, look, I'm sorry if I was obnoxious in your office. More than obnoxious. It's just the way that you were looking out for Eric. It was... I hear he's drinking again. Don't talk about Eric. Todd, I know that you were with Melanie that night. Excuse me? Which doesn't add up with you saying you were with Eric. So I figure that you just said that to protect him. Okay, let's say I was with Melanie that night. You can understand why I wouldn't want the entire world knowing that, right? Right. So why not just say that you were sleeping? Why give Eric an alibi? You should drop this. Eric did it. That's why you can sleep at night and have a normal life, and he's a mess. You should just watch it. When did the hard drinking start? After he killed her? I can make your life very difficult. Eric kills Jill... you clean up after him. Brother's keeper ever since. Am I close? Tell me something, Lilly. What is the point of all of this after so many years? People shouldn't be forgotten. Even if they are my kind of people. Maybe they don't have a lot of money, they don't have lawyers... but they matter. They should get justice, too. I see. You're a crusader. I guess I am. Good luck. So, is sleep like an optional thing for you? I'm not tired. Guess who weighed in on your case today? Mmm... the commissioner. The commissioner? Apparently he and the Whitley's father were college pals. Todd called Bradley to tattle on me? What a baby. And now Bradley's wondering when you're going back on the line. He couldn't pick me out of a line up. Suddenly he's tracking my career? Screw him. Don't say that too loud in this building. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rush... your boyfriend's downstairs. I'm single. You sure it's not your boyfriend? One of the Whitleys... booked for DUI. You crash that nice car of yours, Eric? Thanks to you. I had something to do with it? All I did was bring up Jill. Why's that send you on a bender? My brother called our lawyer, who called the commissioner, who's a very close family friend. I heard all about it. Then why don't you take a hint and back off? 'Cause something tells me you and I are one scotch away from a good conversation. Hey, Lil. Hey. Hey. Las is in with Evelyn Shelby. Huh. I kept my own box on Jill. It's been packed away for years, but I thought maybe it could help. Good. Melanie told me about her and Todd in high school, behind Jill's back. Well, she was only 15. Mrs. Shelby, it looks like we're closing in on Eric Whitley. The younger one? Yeah, well, he doesn't have an alibi for that night. And, uh, he was pretty sick in love with your daughter. I was looking at her yearbook, and I remembered this boy. Ann Winters' son. A few years after Jill died he said something to Ann about the Whitleys getting away with murder. Why isn't this in the file? Well, it should be. John told it to the police. What's the kid name? Charlie Winters. If Britt talked to him I'd have a record of it. He was meticulous. Well, are you sure your husband mentioned it to Britt? He told me he did. Could he have lied, Evelyn? Well, I don't know. I mean, I hounded him about it. He said it came to nothing. That I should stop brining it up. Stop pointing fingers at the Whitleys. They were a powerful family. I guess we both know what it's like to have a husband fail you. We'll find Charile Winters, Evelyn. We'll talk to him, and we'll let you know what he says. Thanks for coming out. I can't really leave the retreat. Sure. It's about Jill Shelby. So, now you wanna hear? Yeah, you told the cops you didn't see anything. Yeah, at first. But then I came to the Shelbys with some good information, and I got the brush-off. You come stoned in your VW van? So? Charlie, Evelyn Shelby's the one who told us about you. Screw Evelyn Shelby, okay? I tried to help her years ago. She wouldn't hear it. You're right, Charlie, but she's not afraid now, and we wanna hear. Okay. I was, um... Kind of passed out on a lounge chair. How could this happen? Just shut up. Why'd you have to wear this? What? It's ruined. That's what you were thinking about? That stupid jacket? Just leave things to me. So, they... got in their car and left, and, man, I just got the hell out of there. Why'd Eric care so much about the jacket? There was this... one year that Eric did wrestling, and... Todd couldn't wrestle to save his life. I think it was the only thing that... he could do better than Todd. Hi. How was it? Good. I need a couple of minutes. I... I have to tell you something that's gonna be hard to hear. Todd was seen with the murder weapon that night. But I was with him. You were asleep after drinking all night. He could've got out of bed later. This is the father of my children. He was involved with a murder, Melanie, that's someone that you don't know very well. Well, maybe he was just covering up for Eric. Even if that's all he did, that's accessory to murder. I wanna tell you something... but if I do, I can't go home. I can help you with that. They're talking every night. They're arguing. Todd keeps telling Eric to stay away from Tabby's. What's that? They have an aunt, Tabitha. She has a house in Chestnut Hill. It was... it was close to where we all used to live. Pack a bag for you and the kids. You're coming with me. Hey. Where's my wife? Safe. Hey, bitch, you tell me where she is. Is this how you handle women you can't control? This supposed to scare me? It's supposed to make you think. I'm not like the girls you're used to, Todd. You can't try to charm me, then when that doesn't work, talk down to me, then when that doesn't work, get aggressive. I'm not Jill or Melanie. I'm the police, and we're at the police headquarters, you moron. You gonna talk to me like that? What are you gonna do? Kill me in the parking lot of Central? You think you'll get away with it again? I know about Tabby's. I'll have a warrant tomorrow, and guys are sitting on it right now. Whatever you hid there, we're about to find it. So it's over. Okay. I can't protect him anymore. I did as much as I could. Why don't you come in, give me a statement? Okay. Flipped on his brother. Do you believe him? could be disastrous. "The wrong sort of people." Like the Thorntons? I didn't say that. I sent you the telegram because this is serious. You're the only one she listens to, Elizabeth. You may think I'm cruel at times, but I have Julie's interests at heart here. I know you do. I didn't mean to be defensive. Talk to her. Make her understand. I'll do my best. I don't even know what I'm doing here. It's just a bump on the head and a couple of broken ribs. I've had worse. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I can come back later. No, it's fine. Nurse Carter, this is my brother... the incomparable Constable Jack Thornton. Oh! You're the Mountie Tom's told me about. What else did he tell you? That you were eight-feet tall and could straighten a horseshoe with your bare hands. Well, Tom likes to exaggerate. A little. How's he doing? Two broken ribs and a concussion. The doctor would like to keep him here for observation. - Have you heard from Julie? - We can talk about that later. I have no secrets from Miss Carter. She knows all about the Thatchers. I have to apologize for my brother's lack of discretion. It's all right. Everyone knows the Thatchers. - They're practically... - Hamilton royalty. Yeah. I've heard. Jack has a very close relationship with Princess Elizabeth. Oh? We both live in Hope Valley. And I escorted her here to Hamilton. Well, she's a lucky woman... to have a Mountie as an escort. Hello? I didn't expect to hear from you again. He is? No. I didn't know he went back. Where did you see him? I'm so eager to get started in the classroom. Elizabeth Thatcher is too easy on the children. Young minds need discipline. Oh. Did I tell you Dottie saw Bill Avery coming out of Abigail's cafe this morning? Before it was open! I would have thought Abigail would have more purity of character than to meet secretly with a man of questionable integrity. How frequently people disappoint us. They certainly do. I always thought my friends had more purity of character than to gossip about me behind my back. - Oh, Abigail, I... - For the record... not that it's any of your business... there is less than nothing between Bill Avery and me. And there never will be. Have I made myself clear? Yeah. A word of advice, Florence. The Good Book says "Judge not that you be not judged." If you went to church and actually listened instead of gossiping, you'd hear that only those without sin should cast the first stone. So if you want to judge the "purity" of someone's character, you'd do well to start with your own. I couldn't have said it better myself. Oh... I suppose I got carried away, didn't I? They deserved it. And that bit about judging was nicely put. If I ever need someone to fill in on Sunday, I know who to ask. I suppose I'm angry. But not with Florence. No, not with Florence. With Bill. Here's my two cents about anger. It's like a toothache. See, a toothache hurts, and the only way to fix it is to do something about it. We all know it, but we put it off because we're afraid it'll hurt worse. But once that tooth is gone, we feel a whole lot better. So you're saying the only way for me to get over being angry is to forgive Bill for what he did. I'm not sure I'm ready to do that. Well, it may be painful, Abigail, but you need to pull that tooth. Trust me. You'll feel a whole lot better once it's done. - My life is over. - That's not true. Father's forbidden me to see Tom ever again, and I'll die if I don't see him. I'll wither away and die. - You won't die. - Then I'll wither. Thatchers do not "wither." But breaking into that dance hall, and then taking Father's car, what were you thinking? One doesn't think when one is in love. Well, one had better start. Didn't I ask you to promise not to see Tom again? You asked, I didn't promise. Julie... you know I only want what's best for you. Then take me to visit him. He needs me. - Jack is with him. He'll be fine. - Honestly, Elizabeth, I thought you would understand how I feel, being in love with the wrong kind of man. I'm not in love with "the wrong kind of man." Well, Jack is Tom's brother! Yes. And that's where the similarity ends. Tom is a good person inside. Yes, he is! But he should have been a lot more careful behind the wheel of that car. It wasn't his fault. The mud was slippery and the tires skidded. It could have happened to anyone. You shouldn't have been out with him in the first place. I'll do as I please with whom I please, and if Father presses charges against the man I love, I swear I shall never speak to him again. Julie, if you want to be treated like a grownup, then start acting like one. Now get out of bed and stop behaving like you're five years old. But what about Tom? We can talk more about him when you're dressed and downstairs, and not until then. - Any luck with Julie? - She's convinced she's in love. Not with that scoundrel. Tom may have his problems, but I wouldn't call him a scoundrel. Of course you wouldn't. He's Jack's brother. You have to defend him. This isn't about Jack. Isn't it? Forgive me for being blunt, but everyone's asking. Do you and Jack have an understanding? An understanding about what? I'm asking if he's made a proposal. That's none of your affair. Huh. So he hasn't. I'm not in any rush to reach an "understanding" with anyone. And, clearly, neither is he. Jack is shy. Or maybe he realizes how difficult it would be for the two of you because you come from such different backgrounds. We're not so different. In fact, I've adapted quite well to life in Hope Valley. The real issue is, when will you make up your mind about who you are and where you belong? - I know perfectly well who I am! - Really? Have you told Charles? Or will you continue leading him on? I'm not leading him on. Charles is one of my dearest friends. You have lots of friends in Hamilton, yet you choose to spend most of your time with him. I think you need to ask yourself why. Mr. Avery. I never got to thank you for all you did to find Clara. You don't need to. Yes, I do. Thank you. She's a fine young woman. Please tell her goodbye for me. I will. I know that this hasn't been easy for either of us... but it's in the past. And I want you to know that whatever happened between us, I wish you the best of luck with everything. I mean that. Thank you. Going on a bit of a run here. Who is that distinguished gentleman in the expensive suit? Bertram P. Harriman. Railroad magnate. He's here to approve the deal that's gonna make Gowen rich. The deal hasn't gone through yet? May as well. Tried everything I can to change his mind, but no cigar. It's not like you to give up. I'm not giving up. I never give up. I'm just out of options at the moment. You've taken the last four pots, Mr. Gowen. Well, I hope you'll forgive me. I mean, given our new business relationship, I would think it'd be more prudent of me to lose, but, well, I just don't work that way. There's no point in playing unless you're out for blood. Clean me out, if you can. I'll respect you all the more for it. Besides... I can afford it. You certainly can. Jack! I almost didn't recognize you out of uniform. Please, join me. You're not expecting anybody else? Oh, no. I usually eat alone, so I can read up on my patients' files. Okay. You seem very dedicated to your work. I am! I get the feeling you are, too. It must run in your family. Wait. Did Tom tell you our dad was a Mountie? You have no secrets from me. Well, that puts me at a disadvantage. My mother was a nurse, so I know what it's like to carry on the family profession. Not that I'm complaining about my work. I like making a difference in people's lives. So do I. I can tell. Speaking of-of medical files... I wonder if I could see Tom's? Are you asking officially? Actually, I'm asking more as a friend. Well, I'm glad to hear we're friends. - I'll see what I can do. - Thank you. I appreciate your help. How are the Thatchers holding up? William Thatcher is pretty upset, as you can imagine. Certainly he doesn't blame you for what happened? I guess I blame myself a little. - Tom's my brother. - That's not fair. Well, I introduced them. You're being too hard on yourself. Well, if it isn't Constable Thornton. Sir Lionel. Viola. Lionel spotted you through the window, and we thought we would just pop in and say hello. Oh, this is Faith. Miss... Miss Carter. She is the nurse at the infirmary. She's taking care of Tom. Delighted to make your acquaintance. We don't mean to keep you from your dinner. Oh, no. We were just meeting to discuss Tom's health. Let him know we wish him a speedy recovery. Yes. Of course. I have good news. Bill's on his way home. Seems to me he's been away a very long time. The life of a Mountie. He's one of the best men they have. I always knew he had a bright future, from the time he was a young boy. Bill idolizes you, Papa. You did so much for him. He owes you everything. Obligation... not the same thing as love. No. Of course not. Sometimes... two people... even the best of people, aren't meant to be together. Bill and I are very happy together. No one is to blame for what happened, Nora. Not you. Not Bill. I assure you, there was no mechanical failure. The fault lies squarely with the driver. I'm not disputing that. Then I don't see the point of inspecting the vehicle. Well... It's standard procedure with an automobile accident. I've made some inquiries. Your brother has a long history of brushes with the law. Good news travels fast. Doesn't it alarm you that he continues to find himself in trouble? It does. But I'm not sure being thrown in jail is going to help Tom. He committed a crime. Everyone makes mistakes, Mr. Thatcher. The true test of a man is how he recovers from them. That may be, but I want your assurance that your brother will stop seeing my daughter. I'll see what I can do. I'm not sure the association between the Thorntons and the Thatchers has proven to be a happy one. Are you asking me to stop seeing Elizabeth? No. I'm hoping that your concern for her... and for our family... will lead you to a decision that would show how much you care about Elizabeth... - and her future. - Mr. Thatcher... I care a great deal about your daughter. Working on your advice column? Well, I'm trying, but... I can't stop watching this. So they've been playing all night? I heard they broke at midnight and started up an hour ago. What's so fascinating? Well, Gowen... Is cheating. - He's cheating? - Mm-hmm. How do you know? Okay, see that man over there by the pillar? - Yeah? - Just watch. I'll be... He's a spotter. He certainly is. He sees Harriman's hand, and he signals to Gowen whether it's strong or weak. How do you know so much about poker? Well, a lady is allowed her secrets. Yes, she is. Listen... There might be a way to beat Gowen at his own game. I was thinking the same thing. It might require a little bit of teamwork, though. - I was hoping you'd ask. - Okay. How's Julie doing? Mm. She's devastated that Father won't let her see your brother. Did she say what caused the accident? The road was muddy and the car skidded. I knew things wouldn't end well between them. The last time we were in Hamilton, I told her to break things off with Tom. Well, I gave him the same advice. Good. Julie's always been attracted to men who are trouble. Well, did you ever think maybe Julie could be responsible for some of that trouble? She's not the one who broke into the garage! Well, but it could've been her idea. Are you blaming my sister for what happened? All I'm saying is there could be more to the story than you think. And when someone as prominent as your father threatens to press charges against someone like my brother, the consequences can be serious. Well, maybe the consequences need to be serious for Tom's own good. Well, maybe they need to be serious for Julie as well. Call. Two pair. Queens and deuces. Three 10s. Thank you, Mr. Gowen, for the most challenging game I've had in a long while. - I don't often lose. - Well, neither do I. Excellent. I only do business with winners. Gentlemen. Heard there was a game going on. Too late to get in on it? Mr. Harriman and I have some business to attend to. Oh. Come on, Henry. What's wrong? You've been bleeding me dry since I came to town. I should think that you'd jump at the chance to take more of my money. Well, under different circumstances, I would be delighted, but... But you're a coward. Is that it? Mr. Gowen, a challenge has been given. I suggest you pick up the gauntlet. Why, thank you. The medical report seems to be in order. Thanks. He wasn't driving, was he? What makes you say that? There had to be a reason you wanted to see his file. I'm guessing you've examined the car and found some evidence? There's a crack in the windshield on the passenger side of the car. It's consistent with Tom's head injury. Miss Thatcher was behind the wheel, and your brother is lying to protect her? She doesn't have a license, which means she broke the law, and she is probably terrified of what her father would do if he found out she was driving. Y-You have to get Tom to tell the truth. Well, he won't do it. He puts on a tough act, but deep down, he's the most loyal person I know. He'll never betray Julie. You care about him very much, don't you? Well, he had a tough time of it, growing up without a dad. I grew up without a mom. She died when I was 10. I still miss her, but being a nurse like she was makes me feel closer to her somehow. Same way as being a Mountie makes me feel close to my father. Your brother doesn't have that. It's harder on him than on you. You're very perceptive, you know that? Comes with the job. I raise... 50. Call. Kings full of sixes. Gentlemen, I need to get some air. If you'll excuse me. Drinks are on me. Hello, stranger. Hello. I haven't seen you around town before. But I know your type. I've been watching you... and I think you and I need to have a little chat. It's good to see your appetite has returned. There's no sense in me withering away. I have to keep strong if I'm gonna fight for the man I love. I thought you talked some sense into her. Let's just be grateful she's come out of her room. So what have you heard about Tom? He's better, but they're keeping him in the infirmary just to be sure. You must convince Father to let me visit. I need to see him to know he's all right. Jack will let us know if there's anything to worry about. Apparently, Constable Thornton has struck up a friendship with Tom's nurse. Who told you that? Lionel and I were having dinner downtown. We spotted them in a restaurant. Jack didn't say anything about it. Hmm. She's very pretty. And they were deeply involved in conversation. I'm surprised he didn't mention it. I'm sure Jack has more important things to think about. I'll take one. I bet... 50. No. Wait. 100. I'll see your hundred, I'll raise you whatever you have left. No, Lee... I'll re-raise you. "Re-raise"? You're busted. No, I'm not busted, and I am gonna re-raise you. I raise you... - my sawmill. - No, Lee. Your sawmill? You want it, Gowen? Here it is. Come and get it. Please, don't do this. You could lose everything. Stay out of this, Rosemary. What am I gonna call with? With your land. The parcel you're using for the railway. I can't make a profit if you control the right of way. You've seen to that. So... It's all or nothing. For you... or for me. Mayor Gowen, I beg you. Mr. Coulter's not in his straight mind. It isn't fair to take advantage of his desperation. Rosemary. Would you please sit down? - I'm trying to help you. - I don't need your help! For the last time... sit down. It's a bet. Club flush, king high. You think I'd fall for your bluff? I knew you would. Only... I wasn't bluffing. Four sevens. You won! Mr. Gowen, again, I must thank you... that was even more entertaining than our game. Mr. Coulter, well done. I truly thought you were bluffing as well. I believe it is you and I who now have business to discuss. I look forward to it, sir. Congratulations. It's a miracle! Fantastic, eh, gentlemen? Drinks are on me! How much longer do I gotta stay in here? As long as it takes. Those ribs might be on the mend, but concussions can be tricky. It's just a scratch! I'm telling you. A funny thing about that scratch... there's a crack on the windshield of the passenger side of the car, mot the driver's side. Like you said... funny thing. Someone's head hit the window, and it wasn't Julie's. Well, maybe something else hit it. Come on, Tom. Admit it. Julie was driving when the accident happened. - You're nuts. - Protecting her is noble. I understand. - But you need to tell the truth. - I am telling the truth. Do you understand that William Thatcher thinks you nearly killed his daughter? I'm not gonna get Julie in trouble! He's gonna forgive her, but he will never forgive you. Sure he will. Everyone likes me. I'm a charming fellow. You wanna be serious for once? All right. Seriously. Tell me about Faith Carter. - I can tell... - You're not helping yourself, Tom. You know... mm. I think my head's starting to hurt after all. I'm gonna take a little rest. Close the door on your way out. So just how did you persuade Gowen's spotter to give him the wrong signal? Oh, I've dealt with lots of men like him, and their only loyalty is money, so I just offered him three times what Gowen was paying him. That's my girl! Now, suppose Gowen still had the better hand? Oh, I knew he didn't. How? Because when I was begging Gowen to let Lee off the hook, I may have snuck a teeny little peek at his hand. She gave me the signal, so I knew that I had him beat. Like this. You see? It's very convincing, right? Oh, I wish I had been there to see that. Well, the good news is, the rail road company is in business with me now, so that spur line's is going to go exactly where it should. And? And... what? And with all the money that you won from Gowen, you are going to build me the biggest theater this side of the Rocky Mountains! So it would seem. To the future of Hope Valley! Hear, hear. To the future. The evidence is clear as day. Tom was in the passenger seat. But Julie wouldn't lie to me. She was driving without a license, and she's scared to death of your father. Is that what Tom told you? No. He said he didn't want to get her in trouble. But I convinced his nurse to show me the doctor's report... - Oh, yes. - And ev... The nurse. - What about her? - Heard you two... have been spending some free time together. We happened to be having dinner at the same place. She was alone, I was alone. We started talking about Tom, that's all. It's wonderful she's been so helpful. Elizabeth... I'm trying to keep my brother out of jail, and Faith agrees with me that Tom wasn't driving. So you two are on a first-name basis? You spend time with Charles, so why shouldn't I have dinner with someone who's trying to help my brother? Charles... is a friend. A "friend" who would ask for your hand the very second I was out of the picture, but I never questioned your intentions. Not once. I have never given you a reason not to trust me. Neither have I. Then why didn't you tell me about your new friend? Because your family doesn't get to run my life. That's completely unfair. No. What's unfair is Tom taking the blame for what Julie did. Now, you need to convince her tell your father the truth - about what happened. - And you need to talk to Tom about growing up and being responsible. Fine. Fine. Good. Good. Well, if that's all, I think I should be going. Don't let me keep you. Jack... What's happening? I'm not sure. Run! Come on! Run! Run, Debby! Come on, down! Down! Down! You have to run. Run! They're coming. Come on, Debby. Where's your fucking exit? I'm running out of ammo. We're close! You said that a minute ago. Fuck! There's too many of them! Why don't they attack? Batteries not included? Heil Hitler! No. Fuck it. BUNKER OF THE DEAD Subrip: Pix This suit is awesome but they'll never let us pass with this. No prob. We'll cover it with a jacket. -Great, man. -Just like Clark Kent. Put some glasses on and everybody believes your someone else. -Whoo-hoo! -Does it fit? Yup, but this stuff is heavy. That's the batteries for the 3D camera and lights. Gives you power for nearly 24 hours. Yeah. Great. You don't have to carry it. You just got to endure it Bruce Lee style. Wah... Come on! Come on! Come here come on. -Come on. Like this, pussy? -Okay. I surrender. Hey, kids. I hope that's just cops and robbers and not what it looks like. You want a free ride? You're gonna be proud of your brother when I'm famous and on every vip list of every party in town. Yeah, sure. Make me proud and let me borrow your car tonight. My car? Of course. Thanks a lot. Now I'm already proud. You like what you see? -Yes. -Cool, but there's something itchy and scratchy on my neck. -Could you...? -Yeah. -Where? -More to the left. -Left. Left. -Left? -Right. -I don't see anything. -But I do. -Nope. Just cloth. Nothing else. Already better. Much better. -Thank you. -Welcome. Well, sweethearts. Then you two have fun with whatever you're up to. See you later. Yeah. Bye. Jeez. She's giving me a hard-on. She's so hot! I need that tape. -What? -Did you just film my sister's tits? You want a copy, too? You just filmed my sister's tits! Chill it, man! We're in the middle of unveiling one of the last secrets of world war ii and you're filming my sister's tits, man! -Man, boobs in 3D! -Give me the camera! -Did you get a signal? -Yeah. What's your ugly face doing on my arm? I told you. That's the live feed from my web cam. That's how we can stay in contact. Cool. Let me have a look. Awesome! I can see myself on TV! Cut it out. -Fuckin' idiot! -Can it play movies, too? Hey! Your sister's movies? Let's go. Look, it's a little bit late. If you wanna change your mind... What? Why? Well, I could do some more research, -improve the suit. -Come on! This is the thing we've both waited for years. The big secret, the conspiracy -the fucking gold! -[Thomas I'm just saying... Then stop saying it! Okay. It's too late now anyway. -What? -The cam. Hurry. Take off your helmet. Hey! Give me... take it off! We are not the droids your looking for. Yeah, right. That'll make me laugh when I'm off duty. What do you two cinderellas want? And why the hell is he dressed like a north Korean spy? We're visiting my dad at the shooting range and my buddy here wants to blow off some steam. Right. Does the old man know you're coming? Affirmative. Here. Should we call him? Nope. It's fine. Make sure you stick to the main road. Don't stop until you get to the shooting range. Copy that? -Stick to the main road and don't stop. -And don't get any stupid ideas. -Never, ever! Yup. Say, the permit, was it real? What do you think? You are the man, man. Stop the car. Stop the car. Here it is. Suit you up and go. Okay. Keys? I got your promise, not a scratch... promise me. Not a scratch... I'm serious. Dead serious. I'll kill you! I'll revive you and kill you again and again and again! -I... -Yeah, yeah. Just watch it. Hey, sicko. Wait up. What? -Here. -The diary? Watch your back. You know me. Exactly. Hey, bubba, I found the inner fence. Are you sure it's the right one? I think so. It looks right. -What about the guards? -Forget 'em. -They're not here. -Electric fence? -Off line. -Are you sure? -Yeah. I checked. -Okay. Then let's do it. God! Let go! Markus, let go! Please! Don't die! Please, Markus, don't die! Markus! Markus? Damn! Fuck... Fuck you, man! You should have seen your face! -I almost had a heart attack. -Someone just shit his pants. I hope you step on a fucking landmine you cocksucker. Yeah, but you would like that. Just for the record, I knew you were kidding. -Of course you did. -You're still an idiot. You're welcome. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! What? What's wrong? -What's wrong? There's a patrol! -What? -Did they see you? -I don't know. Fuck! They're stopping. Don't do anything stupid. Did you hear me? -Quiet. -Markus! Hey, what's wrong? There was a guy on the street. I saw him. Come on. That was just a stupid animal. Bavarian yeti... whatever the fuck they call it. It's wolpertinger. Yeah, wolpertinger. Sounds like a bratwurst. Hey. I don't care. We got a job to do here. All of a sudden, you give a shit? Yeah. It's probably nothing. Of course it's nothing. Just like your girlfriend. She's still better than your right hand. And I have to take a leak. What the...? What? Man! Man! -Man! -Speed this up! Fuck you. Small things have big beginnings. Seriously, man. Dude, I'm off duty in 30. Let's roll. 'Bout time, motherfucker. Next time, bring a diaper! No, no, no, no! What? You have your phone? -Shit. -Great, now we're done for. I come in peace! God! Tell me where to go! No way! Left. Go left. -No, the other left. -You mean right! Shit! Markus! Hey! Stay right there! In your dreams! Shit. My dad's gonna kill me. What a bunch of losers! They're as slow as bubba! What? No, no, no, no. No, no. Don't move. Don't move, baby. Don't even think about it. Sorry about that. Ext time, you'll get a kiss. -Hey! Drop the gun! -Here. Hey, give me a call! The dam. I found it. The dam, bubba. I found the damned dam. Bubba? Bubba! Can you see it? I don't wanna talk to you anymore. Shit. There's a guard. Now stop being a pussy and tell me where the entrance is. It's somewhere at the bottom of the dam. Okay. Piece of cake. Yeah. Just make sure they don't see you again. Roger. Cloaking device activated. Would you please take this seriously? Relax. Stein wrote in his diary about a steam exhaust. -Look for that. -Exhaust. Okay. -Can you see it? -No. It's full of water. You didn't tell me about the water! That's why it's called a "dam." Have you lost your mind? Do I look like a fucking sailor to you? No! Wait! Markus! Hello? Thomas? Thomas, can you hear me? Thomas? Thomas? Thomas, do you copy? Thomas. Thomas, do you copy? I copy! You're alive! Thank god you're alive. -I seriously thought you were dead. -Man, me, too. I'm okay. I'm okay. -Just a scratch. -I lost you for over 2o minutes and the army's looking for you. Where the hell are you, man? I have no idea. I have absolutely no idea but you gotta see this. What... What the...? Holy cow. Isn't that crazy? Look at this shit. This could be the exhaust Stein was talking about. Bubba, this is it. No doubt. Going in now. Be careful. Shit. This is awesome. I'm the first human being down here. I feel like Lance Armstrong. -It's "one small step for"... -Neil. -What? -Neil Armstrong. It's Neil Armstrong and his steps. -You idiot. -Are you sure? Yes, I am. Okay. Okay. I trust you. What's wrong? Dead end. Looks like I have to dive. Set up the hub before you do. I hope those things work. They'll do their job. Trust me. Okay. Then let's see where this is going. See you later! Shit, is the water cold! -Are you all right? -I'm okay. Okay. This... man. This is man-made. -This... -Look at this. We really found it! Yes. This is crazy. Fucking crazy. -Hub up. -Okay, bubba. Up. Okay. Where do you want me to go? The gold should be on the second level. You gotta find a way up. What the fuck? Do you see that? I see it. But what... Wait, that's it! That's what we're looking for. -What the fuck? -What? I wonder what happened down here. But, Markus. That's disgusting! Then stop touching it! God. Just want to see if it still works. After 70 years? Never. Great. Made in Germany. What was that? -Did you hear that? -I did. Maybe it's air shifting or bats. Bats? I hate bats! Hey, by the way, did you actually think about how we can get all the gold out? Let's just find it first. Yeah. Markus? Markus, I'm losing the signal. Hey... Hey, once again hub up. Great. Good job. -Better? -Better. Scheisse! -What? -I saw someone. I didn't see anything. He was right there. A man. I'm sure I'm not alone down here. Sicko, there's no one down there but you. Just chill out. What the...? -There! -Fuck! -You see him now? -Yeah. But I don't know what I saw. I'm not sure that was a man. Maybe the light... Shadows fooled us. Shit. I'm not blind. There's something very alive down here. Sicko, the only thing alive down there is your imagination. But, just in case, be careful. Be very, very careful. Great. This looks promising. -I think you're on the right track. -Yeah. Okay. It doesn't get any higher. And no gold so far. Nothing in here. -Maybe here. -Be careful, man. Smelly! Look at this mess! No wonder we have lost war. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Sorry. Markus. Hey, how much can we get for it on ebay? Two, three hundred bucks maybe? Peanuts. Where's my gold? Did that sound like a bat to you? No... sounded like... Came from downstairs. What are you doing? It doesn't matter. I'm going after it. What? Markus, are you nuts? Maybe it's the army. I don't want to get shot again. Dude, I can't hear you. The army never found this place. There's absolutely nobody down here. -Shit! -There. You see? I'm not crazy. Hey, missus. Hey, hey. Holy shit. Boobs! Fuck! Attacking boobs! I'm running! I'm running! What the hell is that? Stay... Out! You gotta get outta there. She's gone. Find me a way out of here, fatso! All right, run! Don't stop. Just keep going, man. Don't stop. Don't stop, all right! Holy fuck! Get away from me! I will stick my imaginary foot up your ass! I'm sorry, man. How was I supposed to know? No gold, but zombies. Great! -What the...? God. -That's not fair! Don't let him bite you! Don't let him bite you! Would you please stop shouting at me? Fuck! Fuck. Perfect! Hey you, Nazi! Watch this! Nazi, watch this! Markus? Markus, are you there? Markus? Markus! I can't see you! Markus! Calm down. I'm here. Look, you've gotta see this. Zombie on a stick. God, stop it. God in heaven! You are so sick! I am sick? I am sick? You are the one who sent me up here in a fucking nest of Nazi zombies! I'm done listening to your going-up shit. I'm going down to the fucking bottom of this fucked up place. You fat fuck, fuck you! -Yeah, you. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll get you outta here. I promise. I'll get you outta there. Calm down, okay? -You gotta relax. -I am relaxed. But this is really fucked up. Next time, find another Guinea pig for adventures. Come on. Fuck! Fuck! And you stop staring at me! What... What the fuck? I don't... I don't... There... It's coming from behind the door. Run! Run, Markus! No. No more running. Come on, there's more where that came from. Here, take a seat. I said, "sit down." Touch down! Yeah, you made the point. You really like this, don't you? Stop talking and start looking for a way out. You again. Markus? I'm gonna kick your ass Freeman-style. No kissing on second date, bitch. Did you find me a way out yet? I'm on it. I'm on it, okay? These maps aren't easy to read. Look, tanks. What did you expect? It is a military base. Come on, how cool is that? Fucking tanks. Good for you. In any case, we are still in the right place. Man. This is so awesome. Don't touch them. Why not? He looks angry. You touched his tank, your fault. You kidding me? Hey, bubba, you making any progress up there? Hey, you try and stay alive. I'm working on it. Yeah, take your time. I'm busy, too. Okay, sicko, I found you a way out. So, where is it? The air ventilation shafts in the main hangar. And you know the location? Sure... Sounds good. Let me just finish this. What are you... What's that good for now anyway? I wanna be the first German burning down this fucking flag. Yeah, I'm curious how you'll like it when the flames attract dozens of those zombies to your location. Let them come. God. Why? Are you done? Nope. Okay, now I'm done. What about those shafts? You have to find the main hangar. Okay, left or right? Left. Okay. What... Didn't you say the U.S. army didn't know about this place? yeah... Tell me again. No, I won't. Anyway, the main hangar should be in this area of the plant. What the hell happened down here? Give me a closer look. Didn't you tell me to be careful? Yeah... Then give me a "careful" closer look. Yeah... great. I just don't get... -What? -That is not from world war two. That's an m16 assault rifle from the '60s. It doesn't make any sense. Why? Because this base was officially shut down and sealed off in 1945. Hello, there. Come here, my little friend. Yeah. Much better than a crowbar. Forget it. It's too old. You never know. Fuck! The land of the free, the land of the brave, the land of the dead. You fucking losers. You fucking losers. Sicko! God, I'm giving up on you. Stop talking to me, you're just another voice in my head. Come on. How fucking big is this plant? About three square miles. And you sure I'm going in the right direction? If I tell you now, you're just going to blame me later. Fair enough. I think I'll take this way. Could this be where they kept the gold? I don't know. Then where is the fucking gold? Come on. There's no gold in here. It's all gone. Fuck! Wait. Hold on. Could this be... It is. We're rich! Gold! Gold! We found it! Aren't you forgetting something? Is there more? Where? Where? Here? There? I'm talking about Nazis. Zombies. Death. I'm rich. Look, you got your gold, now get out of there. Yeah, yeah, I'm going. I'm going. Okay... Do you hear that? Yeah... definitely one of my friends. There you are. Hey... You're okay? Can you believe that? This fucker tried to shoot me. Hey, there's no other way. You have to get past him. Okay. Wait... Wait, I think I got an idea. What are you gonna do? Are you insane? Can you see? I see... I see you're brain-dead. No, not that. This fucker is mimicking me. And that's good for what? I'm show you. Watch and learn... Bang! Sometimes I even amaze myself. And I'm sure they have pills for that. I'm sure I'm running in circles. This place can't be that big. No, no, trust me. This should be the right way. You said "should." Okay, you're lost. I don't feel amazed anymore. Look these maps are crap. They're too old after all, they're wrong. It's not my fault. I'm gonna guide myself now. You useless piece of shit. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, let's see. Can't be that hard. Forget it. I already did that. There's no map of the interior in this book. What? There's no map you could use in this book, Markus. Then why the fuck did you even give me this useless crap? Did you hear that? Hear what? Come on. Get a doctor. There's someone talking. Talking? Talk about who needs a doctor. There, again. It's definitely a voice. I don't know, man. Maybe it's the venting system we're looking for? Venting system? It's a fucking voice. Okay, what does it say? I don't know. Can you locate where the voice is coming from? No. Hey, a fuse box. Maybe I can get some power down here. Give it a try. Okay. -Markus. -Light. I got light! I can't believe it still works after all those years. Amazing. What the fuck is this? Holy shit. God. This is huge. What? Okay, what's next? Elvis... What was that? Bubba, please tell me you know what this is. Yeah... I know what that is. And I'm quite sure it's something you better stay away from. Looks like someone was very angry. I really wanna know what's inside. No. You don't. Hey, at least it could be valuable. Here's a handle. No! Don't touch it! Markus! Stop me, if you can. Damn it! -Fuck! -I told you, don't open it. I told you, I told you, I told you. Run! Markus, run! Aliens! Man, fucking aliens! I just peed my pants. That's awesome. Awesome, awesome. What... Markus? Markus? Daniels, secure the perimeter. Johnson, handcuff him. And let's get this motherfucker topside. Fuck! Freeze! Daniels, cover me! Fuck! No! What the fuck is it? No! Shoot it! Shoot it in the head! I can't stop him! My god! Daniels, Johnson! No! I can't feel my legs. Fuck, my head. No, no, no! No! What the hell? Can you see this? Hey! Hey! Bubba! Hey! Fuck, fuck! No, not now! Shit. Fuck. Fuck! Okay, okay, okay. Calm down. You are dead. I am fine. You are not. Weapons. I need a weapon. Okay. Yes. Come to daddy. Yeah. That's the real thing. Man, if I survive this shit, I know a fat black guy who's in big trouble. In painful trouble. I'm gonna kick you're fucking fat ass. Bloody bastard. Okay... Man. I have a bad feeling about this. Freeze! Hold it right there! Don't shoot, it's me. Not you again. -What's wrong? -It's him, the German. -Get him in here. -Come on, all right, buddy. Get over here. So you're the pain in my ass? Duke, secure him. Asshole, come on. Don't move. Listen, asswipe, my grandfather killed you Nazi fuckheads by the dozens. And I have no problem blowing your brain out of your German head! Why don't you suck my balls? Psst, hey little one! You in the big helmet. Excuse me, when are we going to leave? -You? -What? Well, shit, sorry! Ma'am... misses... Private... sir. It was an accident, okay? Easy, easy... I'm sorry for your lip, okay? I never wanted to hurt you. Hey, don't lose your head over her. She's like that with everybody. Pms, you know? It's okay, o'Neil. All right... Calm down. That's why she didn't give me a call. Say, what happened here? I had no problem killing all those zombies, how come you army guys got hammered so hard? Man, I don't know. We were attacked by something big, bigger than anything you've seen down here. We tried to give 'em cover, but shit... We didn't stand a chance. Fuck, everything happened so fast. Great. I want bubba back. You okay, dude? What do you think? I can't help you with those, buddy. I'm not in charge here. Hey, come on. We both know you're not down here for me. That's the spirit, boy. I like that. You know, it's all top secret and all but... They said we'd find this "thing" in some sort of carrying container. We got there this thing was empty. And man, the sarge was pissed. Sounds creepy. Taylor, get over here. Yes, sir. Get it off me! God damn it. Fuck, fuck! Man! Man down over here. We need a medic. We need a medic. -Shit is out of control. -Fire in the hole. Where are the other units? We have to get out of here, sir. -It's fucked. -Yes, sir. Copy that. Sir, I lost half of our unit. Request backup and permission to fall back. Hey, can I help you? Hey, hey, can I help you? No. Back off. Are you serious? Yes, sir. -Over and out. -Can't stop the bleeding. -Man... -Sir, what did command say? You step back, soldier. Ladies, we're on our own now. Okay, let's check if there's more creatures down here. I don't want any more surprises. -But we're not enough... -You hear me, soldier. Okay, let's go. Start with this area here. Make sure the hallways are clear. -Yes, sir. Move! Move! -This is suicide. Get to work and shut up. That's an order, soldier. Yes, sir. Not you, you stay with meyers. -He didn't make it. -You stay with... He's dead, sir. Fuck it. Fuckers. This shit is so fucked up. Taylor, get me that German asshole. Yes, sir. Come on, move. Listen, boy. Don't get in our way. And don't act like a fool. Then we'll all get out of here in one piece. Is that understood? No problem. I'm easy. Good. He's all yours. Hey, you better not piss him off. Stay here, keep quiet. -Fuck, shit! -Fuck, shit! Fuck! Get away from him! What the hell. Drop him! Watch out! Watch out! You okay? Yeah. Eat this, kraut. Yeah, I just can't believe this is really happening. What should we do? -Quiet. -Not sure that's gonna save us. Hey, hey, he's still alive. Man, look, he's still alive. Shit, sir! Listen to me, soldiers... Backup's not coming. You have to get outta here, now. Help's on the way. No, no, it's... Run... now, go... They don't want us alive. They... Shit. Fuck! It doesn't make any sense. No. Excuse me! What part of "run" didn't you understand? -Fucking radio. -Shut up! No. Are you fucking stupid? He said run. We have to get out of here. Echo three to echo seven, do you copy? -Hey, hey, listen! Hey! -Stay away from him. Don't touch him. Fuck! Listen, o'Neil. I know what he meant, and he was right. And nobody's coming for us. That's what I've been telling you all along. So won't you please? Look, it makes sense. We need all the help we can get. Hello... Yeah, yeah, wait, wait. I don't like this. We're gonna get outta here. We're gonna make it, buddy. Thank you. Very much appreciated. All right, grab some ammo. Let's get the hell outta here. What about me? Hey! Hello! No. No weapon for you. Okay, great. No gun. Not that I need one. I'm fine, just fine. Pfft, who needs a gun in times like these? Let's move. Watch your backs. -Get over here. -Move it. Hey! Stop pushing me, okay? Hey, quiet, don't talk anymore. Man. All clear. Moving. Clear. -Stay close. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay... Hey, o'Neil. -All clear. -All right. Hey, are we there yet? Come on. Move, move. Cleared. Shit. The main entrance must be around here somewhere. You guys really remind me of a former friend of mine, bubba. Heard of him? Great navigator. Jesus. Contact. What the fuck? Shit! Fuck, fuck! O'Neil! God, who did you eat? You smell like a bag full of shit. Are you fucking kidding me? Fucking great... Brilliant. What? He's got my weapon, you asshole. I'm very sorry for saving your life. You're welcome, but you know, that's how we handle things in Germany. Okay... And... Nothing I haven't already done. How cool! That's how we handle things in the U.S. Amateur. Awesome! Hey, hey, can I have a grenade too? Hey, come on. Just a little one, please. Hey, I promise, I'll only blow up Nazis? Somebody over there. Maybe the backup team. Sir, we have possibility of survivors... It's about fucking time. Possibility of survivors. All right, stay put. Stay quiet. Yes sir, we understand. This is lieutenant Taylor. United States army with two other survivors. Radio was cut off. Hello? This is lieutenant Taylor of the United States army. Anybody there? No, wait... No! No, Taylor! Watch out! Head down, head down. -Hey, -sir, we have two survivors. Sir? Sir? Do you copy? Do you copy? We got two survivors. Get it off, get it off me! Get it away from me! Shoot it! Come on, come on, get down. For once, listen to me. Okay. Sounds safe now. -You go first. -Great. Okay. You asked for it. No, no. Hold. Don't... don't shoot. Stop. What? Don't ask. It's complicated. You gotta be kidding me. All available units, seal the doors. Repeat, seal the doors. Hey, hey, hey! Open the door! Hey! Come on! Come on! Open the door! Hey, fuck! Fuck! Come on! I will burn you! Fuck. What the... Hey! What's wrong? Are you nuts? Okay, please tell me that this is just a military alarm clock. Shit. It's kind of a mini-nuke. In auto mode. What? Five kilotons. Enough to clean up this mess here, but not enough to cause serious trouble on the outside. It's an a-bomb. Come on. You're kidding me. They can't blow up an a-bomb. We are in Germany. Yes, they can. Quit pissing your pants. It's gonna fry us but won't damage the structure. Okay, great. You just got fucked by your own people. I guess they fucked both of us. Yeah... Is that supposed to make us partners in crime or something? Come on. Stop it. Turn it off? No way. No use in trying. Getting out isn't very likely now, is it? Fucking bastards! I'm sorry. Why? It's not your fault. We're expendable. Nobody cares. Yeah, but you wouldn't be down here without me. Okay. Now that you reminded me. It was your fault. Let's wait for the big bang. We won't feel anything so close to it. I don't like that option. Try to live with it. You mean, "die with it." Whatever. Funny how it all ends? Fantastic. -What? -My name is Markus. Debby. I was on my way to go swimming when the order came in. I could be there right now with my friends, you know? What did you say? Swimming, drinking good bavarian beer. -Swimming? -All that stuff. Schwimmen? I know a way out! What? Where? -Downstairs. -You're kidding me, right? Do I look like I'm kidding? Come on, soldier. Let's go.

I'm starting to get used to you. That's my legendary charisma, you know. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This looks familiar to me. Yeah. Hey, there. The door. We're almost there. The good thing is, I didn't come across any zombies down here -when I came in. -Let's hope so. We're running out of ammo. Hey, trust me. Hold this! Hold this! Shit! Give me your grenade.

You have to dive as long as you can. -Just don't stop. -What? Debby, you have to go now. Forget it. The bomb will blow up any second. I'm not going to leave you. Watch out. -Call me. -No! Okay, Adolf, you filthy pig. Looks... Like... You Lost again, mein führer! Okay, blondie, come on. Come to daddy. Crap. Markus? Markus, come on, man. Come on. You all right? We made it, man. We made it. Step back, soldier. We're here to handle it. I got him. We're good to go. Package ready to be delivered. We're moving out now. Choppers, are you ready for takeoff? What the...? -Doctor, he's awake. -Here. Hold this. What about that fat guy in the car? On the run. He left the car empty. They're searching the area. It's only a matter of time till they find him. I want him contained as soon as possible. Yes, sir. And he had this on him. What's her condition? She's gonna be fine. -Leave us. -Yes, sir. Garbage. You know, history is not written in ink. It's written in blood. I'm going to ask you once. The name of the location of your collaborator? Come closer. Closer. Closer. Last chance. Where is your collaborator? I'm telling you once. Fuck you. And fuck your fucking army. Your choice. No. No! You killed him! No. I authorized myself to execute him. And you. What the fuck? He was recording everything, you morons! Find that fat fuck and bring me those tapes. Yes, sir. Move, move, move, move, move! Fuck! Okay, you can start with the other one. What the hell is this? What are you talking about? "Made in Germany." Crazy. Come on, give it to me. Let's see. Looks like a camera. Say "cheese." You're on can... Shit! What... what? Adolf was fucking blind. Hey, look at the lens, man. Why are you here again? Because I'm a believer. The only person on this planet still listening to you. Hey, and because of your hot sister. Hey, are you sure you got this right? I mean, I can't read shit here, and I am German. Sure, I'm sure. I've been studying it for months. The reichsgold is closer than ever. Cool. And what about those secret weapons, neu schwabenland, aliens, ufos? Bullshit. Nothing but myths. Constructed to deflect the truth about the gold. Yeah, but the website says it's true. I mean, what if it is true? It isn't. None of it. Whatever is hidden in these caves, I'll find it. Sicko. Hey, bubba, when is this suit ready? I need action. Two weeks at least. Two more weeks? Come on. The suit and the camera are prototypes. It takes time, okay? All right. They why don't you stop eating and start working, bubba? Or is it already bubba fat? -Let me explain... -Hey, tell them about your father. What? Tell them about your father, the army, the coverup. -All the cool stuff. -Man. Can you just shut the fuck up? And tell them about your hot sister. Hey, leave my sister out of this. Good. This book is the diary of Jacob Stein. He's a Jewish prisoner with the dachau working the messerschmitt caves in oberammergau. Wait. That's important. I have to capture that. What... What're you doing? Close ups, details... What any good director would do... No, no, no. Hold on a sec. You're not the director. I am. Listen, you're the cameraman, and therefore, you got nothing to say. Okay? Got it? Got it. But this diary is important. Its old. It tells a secret. It's the key to tons of gold. We have to show it, okay? Boobies. Cool. But are you sure this diary is legit? No. I got it on ebay. Of course it is. Hey fatso, what if there's still some secret old Nazi stuff down there, or... or even better, an old community just like those weird Nazis from the moon? Just saying... Okay, I m recording. Okay, great. Now, this is the outer fence. Beyond it, it's all military and restricted and shit. But im working on a way to get you in. Then we II get you to the upper dam. Upper dam. Got it. And if Stein's diary is correct, you II find the secret entrance to the Nazi base there. Yeah! And tons of Nazi-gold. We're gonna be rich, man, fucking rich! They are now entering the tunnel system that was part of the messerschmitt caves. They used the tunnels as storage sites -for the airplane parts. -Okay, cool. And I have to admit they were smart. Real smart. They drove fully loaded trucks into the tunnels. And on the other side they drove out -with empty ones. -Okay. That's how they fooled the allied air surveillance for years. Okay, and they did the same with all the gold? Yes, I think so. Officially the gold was to be transported to Hitler's eagle's nest in the alps. But it was never found. Thomas, its cold and it's wet. -I can t see shit... -We're here, okay? This is the only publicly accessible part of the caves. And here... Wanna know what's on the other side? The gold? Right behind this rock are tons and tons of Nazi gold waiting to be found! -That s the idea. -Shit, man. Great. Take the cam, bubba. Okay. Give me that. Right. Hey, why can't we just blow up this wall? Why... why... Why go all the way around? That's a much easier way to get in. Forget it. The army would be here in no time. And by the way, I'm not a terrorist. I don t have a shitload of dynamite in my basement. Come on, let s go. There s more to see outside. Are you sure it's a smart idea to sneak in a U.S. army base in the middle of the night? Do you see any guards? No, not yet. I cant see a thing. Let me switch on the cam-light. No, the guards would see it. You said there weren't any guards. Over there, no. Over here, yes. I did my research. I've been here with my dad a thousand times. Fuck! Guards! Run! I'm running! Shit. Look, I'm running. The car, get in the car! Run, run, run! Shit! You... You fucking asshole! You goddamn... I just wanted to get you a little workout. Not funny. 'How many were they?

She knows that Richard has die. and I answer him that all that to me is Chinese. It's cold! It's so cold! Still cold! I feel like I'm in Antarctica. Antarctica. Here is Antarctica. It's far away. No warm at all. Warm. I Passed the Equator, And the Sahara. It's getting hotter. I have the last breath. It's close. Have a listen to his voice. Chapter 3 Eternal revolution, that's political. If the variety of economic groups and their diligence Could exceed the chanciness of the economy, there is efficiency. Chapter 7 Robespierre and St. Just in the guiding principle Have already foreseen. In the guiding principles the reality Which Robespierre and St. Just foresaw and visualized Is very surprising. The year after next it will be realized. I'm one of the people who have carried on this thought. Chapter 12 The development of destiny of government is terminated temporarily. The independences of colonial, the battle aiming for the victory of civil war and the position of republican president Exploit new domain for the activity of every cell. My point of view has changed. Why did I meet the doctor? Why did I get to the hospital of the army? There are on dangers. Although today's kills are also simple, I tell her, Here, At the tie with black suit. Many of friends at Paris May have regained the power. I know that. The public opinion never get their Precise conclusion by Analyzing opinions from every side. Certainly it does not. It is based on that information Leaked out of the secret official stack. This is a typical technique, Repeatedly. The public opinion never get their Precise conclusion by Analyzing opinions from every side. It is based on that information Leaked out of the secret official stack. It is a typical technique of the police country. After meeting those two people I perfectly realized the meaning of the existence of those secret police. You are really good student from science university. They shout that people in country programming office are untrustworthy. Though they have no secrets. This maybe a lie. It's not you or me killed Typhus. But there must be ones for the same purpose. Let's help eachother. Average the profits. What's up? Does chanticleers turn into cuckoos? Do you go in for me? Because the cuckoos do. Kroutchov's speech in the Youths league meeting. It's you killed him. But why this is unreasonable. So coincident? You will understand soon. What about you? You gossip! Whatis wrong? What? Very good. Things you know. Can you tell something you presume? It's better not to say it. You are the suspect of the murder. Only I have the proof of not being there that time. He is very handsome. His partner killed my underling in Dakar. they worked for Bony and Lafont We work for Colonel Passy in London. called. "I thought I saw a Pussy Cat." Stop! I will take her away. Go quickly. I know. I hate the police. I can not describe this feeling in any words. That girl. She killed my uncle. He is a fool. Wait outside. That girl. I hate the police. I can not describe this feeling in any words. You have traded with Typhus, right? No, it's a mistake. Is it? Then I think. That is friendship without trade. in other words, you will meet in any way, right? So it is. What do you want? . This Mr Typhus is not the old Liutenant Jo Attila. I have nothing to tell you. Always like this. Police in Paris thinked local people of fools. Do you want to say anything? Richard"'s friend? I have nothing to tell you. 25 Bon Hocht Road He has been working there for three months since Jan 25th. What about others? Waiting for the bus. Secret. Richard hated dying of gradual doating. He was suicided. He was hurt in the head three metres behind. This is usual things. I am looking for the real name. Marie Dufour Give the the phone. Why? Say "calm" to me. I thinked suicide. Why? This is your experience after his death. Because of their torture? With a razor blade In order to receive some solutions from Richard. He tortured him. With a razor blade In order to receive some solutions from Richard. He tortured him cruelly. Terrible, isn't it? Yes. Freedom. Excuse me. I am Richard's sister. He used to working here in Feb and Mar. Is there any letter for me? I know nothing. What's the matter? Richard's name. Was heard from the manager department just the moment. We are all afraid. The salary's raising is to stop our argumentum. Richard is really a good person. Only he is. Once he came to my home, I asked him to help me casting accounts. In the villa in suburb. Where is it? Round the war-airdrome. Exactly on Preminger Road. So it is. Do you understand anything? Maybe. What's the matter? Probably you still want to drive me away. Officer Aldrich is really a person full of finesse. Little does one think, He took the first. He is a boastful person. It's so annoying. Don't laugh. Do you want to tell him my words? I pretend not heard. The principal of the fifth district is me, not him. Of course. What did you say? Who? David Goodis. Aldrich asked again, but he still told nothing. He said that all is a misunderstanding. "Perhaps not that girl." "I haven't seen her before." What did you say to him? Nothing. I considered. The one killed Typhus and the one beat you. Are the same obviously. He is so silly. That peoson has found nothing now. Doctor Ludwig? Likely. I don't understand. I don't understand. The doctor didn't know the inside? You are also the important hostage. Do you think so? Richard is just a dreamer. Dreamer of communism? Like that Picasso was expeled when he died. That was just a play. A big sleight of hand. Which confused you and others. Because Widmark is the killer. lend me the "Kreisler". I was taken to the hotel. And was threatened of killing if I would escape. I didn't tell the location of the villa. "Double-deck house." "To us." "Garden D4 Armide." "Tower A." "You." There are no changes. The police still doubted me. I was immured by Widmark. Give him another call. Try to tell him that the murder's name I considered. Is the same as his. Chapter 19 Comrades, the age changes. But there are full of lies everywhere. Social authorities. Those who afraid of turbulence. Always use patriotism as the quillet. The government only talks about the patriotism. Uses the nucleus threat to instigate people. Devolves our line of sight form the practical social problems. Chapter 47. The right-wing soldier Dumouriez likes dyslogistic foppishness. As the cry up of the people's courage. Give the simple sensation. Politics. Money. What happens when invovled in such things? Richard Chapter 48. Bounteous serching. Release Frech politics from the huge power. While aiming this. Why connive some people's crimes? Faced such question. Comrades, I can answer that. The power begins to split. that would be Armagnac and the Burgundian barons. And Danton? And Dumouriez? The politics begins to swing. this because of the great elder's command. Does the politics begin to swing? Poeple are forced to buy expensive food. Because of the taller elder's command. The high price is consured and his position was unstable. Fluctuates when the comrades confuse. Chapter 89 The essential cause of mistake. Is the uncut relationship between the self-called left-wing colleagues and the opponent. So they begin to accept the "Communism". Ask the comrades. If there is no anti-American tendency, there is no difference. Those who resists like Lecanuet. What is the so-called advancement? Can it be considered as the overthrow of the government? Though the result is clear. Though the new republic union. Possesses the majority of the seat in a legislature, the Communist still exists. If the ministerial party and the anti-communism right-wings. Lasso The so-called advanced communists to possess the majority of the seat in a legislature. The trust of the democratic government will decline rapidly. Our way will be pluged up. As the replacement of this project. For the final success of the Frech Communist Party. We still need hard working. This is the best responses to the anti-communists. They don't want to see the left-wing's triumph. Probably. Really. In order to repay the boss who doesn't attach importance to him. Donald came and brought victim Richard's photo. It was really a political movie. Just like Walt Disney's movie with red-handed scenes. He eventually told the truth. It was he killed Typhus and his nephew. After disordered the room. There wew many horrific things during this seraching-treasure time. He believes neither the secret amanuensis nor the polt. He only believes money. He confessed the villa. He said that if I would give him two millions, he would take me there. He wanted to go to South-American. To achieve his dream. He organized foreign force in local area. And said that to kill all the Jews and Black people. Chinese and Indians. which better? The presupposed death or the sudden death? Sudden death. My God. My God. This is the best responses to the anti-communists. making claer the cause of his death. Drives me to live all along. "The memory is waking up." "The Brown crimp." Can you continue? OK. "He no longer believes." Then? Stop! Run away! "The wonderful destiny." Let's meet in the villa an hour later. We can go into the street safely now. Really? The things about Typhus are over. Because in Paris. There is a command of stopping searching. Aren't you surprised? I feel indifferent. Such a arid woman. Do you mean me? I heard from Widmark. The one who killed Typhus. Was a private eye called Marc Dickson. For the moment I believed him. It's the sequela of the Maroc War. Have they caught Marc Dickson? He is now wanted but we have little thread. Why? Because he died in the big fire in Maroc. Then why he is wanted now? We know it because the absebce of the adjudgement. Only two persons. One is me, who affiliated with his sister. The other is. Widmark? No. It's a woman dressed floridly. Exact the same colour as that of you wear. Orange? Yellow? Isn't the whole thing over? Though. Any doubtful point? Though not suspect, there are some doubtful points. You let him enter you room, right? No, the one entered my room. Was a thief. Did you live in the same hotel in coincidence? No. I don't understand. Didn't you have a appointment? No, I had never thought of meeting him. I knew that Richard was killed from the newspaper. Then I came. I believe that he is the same. who do you vote 2 years ago? It dosen't matter. Just a survey. And published on The Express in 1966. What did it publish? Interesting things. Editorials by Richard. Yes, he didn't resign that time. I resigned when the country intervened. why? Because I think advertisement is just a form of fascism. When Goodis overthrew the confession, I understood. I am not a fool. You indulged in the politics. There are only revenge and jealousy. The friendship will only be dishallowed. I will go back to Paris. You should act well. It's all for you. We are living in a stale world. The world where nothing happens. But other where is completely opposite. "Tomorrow kiss bye." If you keep silence. It will trouble others. I don'r believe. Call Ludwig. It's the last time. What's your name? Robert Mac Namara. Do you hate killing? It's my job. I have no method. What about you? Richard Nixon, I have the same opinion. Go to the boss's house. Where is it? I know. Let's go. "Freedom." The colour of the dress are always yellow and red. The sound changes. Tortured that woman. Then knew the villa's location. I answered. It's not the first time to do such despicable thing. Agadir, the subway in Charonne Mohdi Bon Barka. I payed that fat woman a hundred thousand franc. To make her silence about the fire. It doesn't change. Bleeding, horror and politics. Also money. It's really unfortunate to be involved in such things. Richard As the replacement of this project. For the final success of the Frech Communist Party. We still need hard working. The one who was killed in the fire in Paul Lacroix. Was Richard. The ministerial party brings to bear crimes to the communists that time. So it's easy to understand. He was killed becaude he was too active. He wanted to eacape. I didn't let him go. I was to go back to Paris and do not pay attention to Donald. But. Now that I came here, I will do something completely. Kept acting, kept lying. On the seaside of Italy. It was impossible to enjoy the sunshine. We didn't trust each other any more. We only felt chill about this dangerous gambling. We kept away each other. Time reveals a person's heart. It was Donald killed Typhus. It's not sure. Trust each other? I will too. Candidly. Like "gambling ÁÐÄþÈ"1⁄4 �" and so on. If "it's fine outside" I even don't believe myself. The rather that to trust you. Completely unreasonable. I think of a way. How? I mutiny, and then. Say some adverse witness. I still don't understand. Write a letter. Write "I killed Typhus" in it. Then sign it. Then give it to you. It's not good. We can do it under advisement. I trust you. But you also need write. What should I write? A letter. Should I still write "I killed Typhus" in it? Silly thinking. No, you write "I killed Richard" in it. The question is whether I can survive. I will arrange it. in 10th, Oct. Talks about the Kennedy's murder. 17 witness disappeared successively. "I killed Richard." "I killed Typhus." "All is for money." "He came to my room." "His death was an accident." "We argued." "Ludwig did all of it." "I beat his head with ashtray." Because doctor Ludwig had strong influence to the politics. Things calmed down soon. "17th, Sep, 1966" "PaulWidmark, 17th, Sep." "Paula Nelson" How? Not bad. Show your hands! What? Don't move. Finally the proof was found. Therefore you let e write this letter,don't you? No proof. Nothing is immerged. You are lying. I need not lie. Now. Do you prepare to die? Thanks, David "Far from time and space." "People are confused." "Thin like hair." "Fecundity like dawn." "I listen carefully." "Open my eye." "Stretch my hands out." "To search the future way." "But no results." I finally finished my novel because of you. No thanks. David, prepare to die too. Don't disguise the truth any more. Through your novel we all know the truth. The poems and the truth are relative. Why do you always say metaphor? Saying about "time" not because of the visit of time. Saying about "space" because of the disappearance the space. Saying about "time" because of the lapse of the time. Saying about "person". Because that person will die. Paula,you deprived my youth. David. Such a miserable endding. Where is it? Am I talking? I am talking. really. Now the thoughts become deep. Did I kill others with this pair of hands? Suddenly I forget my crimes. Before the next crime. Am I feeling the secret of my inside? Life, wraps me in this inundatory time. Night. has no endding as the daylight. The noght is deep. I continue moving. Towards the road of the dawn. Birth. Death. Life of the Things with me. Life of me who cherishs Richard's body. My knowledge is certain. And originally is a kind of uncomplete disguise. Only a kind of thing changes my spirit and body. My consciousness. Picked me up from the world disappeared. The tragedy of haste. Phillippe... What's up? Who are you? I am the collector from the broadcasting station,at Chateauroux. And you? I escaped from the "oÚ°�ÊÂ1⁄4þ". And killed two persons just now. My name is Paula. What do you want? Take me. Ok. "0 year ,left wing." Don't worry. Fascist age doesn't come. It certainly will come. If it spreads everywhere, it's better. Just like barge, mini skirt and rock-and-roll. But, the fighting will continue everytime. I mean fightinf in the heart. Horrible, isn't it? If you are tired before the fighting. Maybe you will be killed. Any cigarette? In that box. Take one? Things about Richard. Finally take the revenge. But your words are quite impenetrable. And the case of Ben Barka,is it over? It already passed. Though it passed I have my principals. Are you still working for the book concern? Will you write a book about these things? Perhaps a book as that which you did want to do on Oswald? Good idea. Then don't refer the principals any more. You are just like before. "The horrible child Elisabeth. The left and the right are the same. People do not change. The right wing, though. Silly and depraved. But the left wing is too moonstruck. And. Compared with the right. The left is full of things completely out of date. I don't want it. Then what should we do in the future? ( gunshots ) MAX, WHAT'S HAPPENING? ANSWER ME!

AND THERE'S A HECTOR BACCARDO, A PORTUGUESE POLO PLAYER. - LET ME TALK TO 86. - RIGHT, CHIEF. MAX, HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. HI, CHIEF, THIS IS MAX. Chief: Max, are there any clues?

DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, CHIEF, I CAN HANDLE THIS CASE. WE CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCE OF THOSE PLANS FOR THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP FALLING INTO ENEMY HANDS. WE MUST FIND THEM. DON'T WORRY, CHIEF. I'LL FIND 'EM. AND WHEN I DO, I'LL CONTACT YOU. OKAY. BUT TRY TO KEEP YOUR IDENTITY AS SECRET AS POSSIBLE. DON'T WORRY, CHIEF. I KNOW HOW TO BE INCONSPIC- -UOUS.

BUT THE OLD WALRUS HASN'T LOST HIS BARK. THE SWABBIES STILL JUMP AT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE. HARD TO PORT, ALL FULL AHEAD! AREN'T YOU GONNA WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? YES, BUT-- WRITE IT DOWN? ! NO, CAPTAIN, YOU SEE, I JUST WANTED TO TALK WITH YOU. WAIT A MINUTE. AREN'T YOU THE FELLOW FROM THE MAGAZINE? I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND YOU, CAPTAIN. THE MAN FROM "TIME" MAGAZINE, THE ONE WHO'S GONNA INTERVIEW ME. I THINK YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE, SIR. OF COURSE. IT'S JUST THAT I'VE WAITED SO LONG. THEY'VE NEVER WRITTEN ME UP. NIMITZ, HALSEY, RICKOVER. ALL OF THEM. THE ADMIRALS, THE CAPTAINS, THE COMMODORES, ALL OF THEM BUT ME. - SORRY ABOUT THAT. - YOU'RE SORRY! IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY!

AND UP AND DOWN-- I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN, BUT DO YOU MIND IF I SIT DOWN FOR A MOMENT? OF COURSE. NOW, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? WELL, CAPTAIN, I NEED YOUR HELP. BUT FIRST I MUST REVEAL TO YOU SOME INFORMATION THAT IS HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL. YOU MAY CONSIDER ME THE SOUL OF DISCRETION. MY NAME IS MAXWELL SMART. I SHALL NEVER BREATHE IT TO ANOTHER LIVING SOUL. - UH, NO, SIR, THAT'S NOT IT. - PLEASE CONTINUE. WELL, YOU SEE I'M A SECRET AGENT WORKING FOR... - CONTROL. - CONTROL? YOU WORK FOR CONTROL? - YOU'VE HEARD OF IT? - NO. OH. CAPTAIN, SOMEBODY ONBOARD YOUR SHIP HAS STOLEN THE PLANS FOR THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP. MR. SMART, I CAN VOUCH FOR MY CREW. I KNOW EACH MAN AS THOUGH HE WERE MY OWN BROTHER. WHY, THEY'RE THE PICK OF THE SCUM OF EUROPE! WELL YOU SEE, SIR, IT'S NOT ONE OF YOUR CREW. IT'S ONE OF THE PASSENGERS. WHOEVER IT IS HAS ALREADY KILLED TWO MEN, ONE RIGHT HERE ONBOARD THIS SHIP LAST NIGHT! YOU MEAN... THERE IS A DEAD PERSON ONBOARD MY SHIP? - YES SIR. - HMM. THAT MAY BE AN OMEN OF BAD LUCK. ISN'T THAT KIND OF AN OLD SUPERSTITION, CAPTAIN? TRY TELLING THAT TO THE CORPSE! YES. CAPTAIN, I'VE GOT TO GET THOSE PLANS BACK. SO FAR THE KILLER AND THIEF HAS ONLY LEFT ME ONE CLUE-- AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THAT YET. AND WHAT'S THAT, SIR? WELL, WHEN HE WALKS HE MAKES A STRANGE KIND OF A CLIP-CLOP SOUND. - A CLIP-CLOP SOUND? - YES, A CLIP-CLOP SOUND. REST ASSURED, SIR I SHALL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO ASSIST YOU. MY SERVANT MING CAN HELP US. PERHAPS YOU'VE SEEN HIM. OH YES, THE BIG CHINESE FELLA. CHINESE? GOOD HEAVENS, OF COURSE! HE'S CHINESE! I WONDERED WHY HE WAS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND. I THOUGHT HE HAD A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT. YES. WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP, CAPTAIN. DON'T THANK ME, SIR. IT'LL BE A PLEASURE TO HELP YOU. PERHAPS IT WILL RELIEVE THE MONOTONY OF THE VOYAGE.

NO, BUT HE'S GONNA TRY AND HELP US. ( water splashes ) HOLD IT, 99. THERE'S A MESSAGE WRITTEN ON MY PORTHOLE. MUST BE FROM 44. MAX, THERE'S A MESSAGE ON MY PORTHOLE TOO. MINE SAYS, "UNLESS PURSUED, OPEN NO DOORS." AND MINE SAYS, "EELS CAN KILL, NOT ONLY WOUND." I THINK 44 IS FINALLY CRACKING UP. MAX, IT MUST BE SOME KIND OF CODE. HE MUST BE TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING. Max: But what? MAX, TELL ME THE FIRST LETTER OF EVERY WORD IN YOUR MESSAGE. "U, P, O, N, D." AND MINE ARE "E, C, K, N, O, W." AND PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER AND THEY SPELL... MAX! "UP ON DECK NOW." 44 WANTS US TO MEET HIM! RIGHT, 99. NOW LISTEN TO ME AND LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY-- WE'VE GOT TO GET UP THERE AND CONTACT 44. BUT I WANT YOU TO LEAVE YOUR STATEROOM WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED BY ANYBODY. - HAVE YOU GOT THAT? - RIGHT, MAX. - I'LL SEE YOU UP THERE THEN. - RIGHT. OVER AND OUT. ( knocks ) - ( bangs ) - 44? WE'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE, MAX. I DON'T THINK HE'S UP HERE. NEITHER DO I. - WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? - WE'RE LOOKING FOR AGENT 44. 44. WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG TO GET HERE? FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO DECODE THAT MESSAGE YOU LEFT ON THE PORTHOLE. OH, WAS IT HARD? YOU KNOW, SECRET MESSAGES ARE ONE OF MY SPECIALTIES. I'VE SEEN HARDER. MAX FIGURED IT OUT RIGHT AWAY. 44: YOU DID? WELL, YOU WAIT UNTIL NEXT TIME. I'VE GOT A HUMDINGER. YOU'LL NEVER GET IT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, 44? WHAT GOOD IS A SECRET MESSAGE IF NOBODY CAN UNDERSTAND IT? LISTEN, 86, I DON'T HAVE MUCH FUN ON THIS JOB. THERE'S NO MINGLING WITH THE GLAMOROUS PASSENGERS, NO DECK TENNIS, NO GALA EVENINGS AT THE CAPTAIN'S TABLE. NO NO, NOT FOR ME. TAKE IT EASY, 44. TAKE IT EASY. I MEAN, A SPY CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH-- FUNNELS AND PORTHOLES AND SLEEPING IN THE CARGO HOLD. HIDING, ALWAYS HIDING! ( crying ) I WANT TO COME IN FROM THE COLD! ( sobs quietly ) WE UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL, 44, HONESTLY WE DO. BUT YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO TRY TO GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF. HERE, BLOW. ( foghorn blows ) TAKE IT EASY, 44. NOW WHAT WAS IT YOU WERE GOING TO TELL US? - YOU WON'T TELL THEM ABOUT THIS BACK AT HEADQUARTERS? - OH, OF COURSE NOT. WE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH. THE CHIEF WOULDN'T LIKE IT. SOMETIMES IT HELPS TO HAVE A GOOD CRY. TRY TELLING THAT TO THE CHIEF. HE HATES TO HAVE HIS MEN CRY. - HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW. - IT'LL BE OUR SECRET. YOU'RE VERY UNDERSTANDING. DON'T YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF SECRET INFORMATION FOR US? OH YES, ALMOST FORGOT. YOU KNOW THAT PORTUGUESE POLO PLAYER? - HECTOR BACCARDO. - THE ONE IN THE WHEELCHAIR. RIGHT. WELL HE'S NOT WHAT HE PRETENDS TO BE. - I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT! - HE'S POLISH. OF COURSE. PORTUGUESE ARE TERRIBLE POLO PLAYERS! AND HE KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE STOLEN PLANS. - HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? - I WAS UP ON DECK TODAY TAKING A LITTLE SUNTAN IN THAT SMOKESTACK OVER THERE. BACCARDO WAS TALKING TO THAT SENORITA MERENDEZ. - WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT? - ABOUT THE PLANS. HE SAID TO HER THAT IF YOU'LL HELP ME I'LL MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE. - GO ON. WHAT ELSE? - AND HE SAID THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW WHERE THE PLANS WERE HIDDEN BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T PLANS. - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? - I THINK I KNOW. WELL, GO AHEAD AND TELL US. I BET YOU DON'T THINK I'M SO INEPT NOW, DO YOU? I NEVER SAID YOU WERE INEPT, 44. NO NO, BUT I CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES. LOOK, 44, ARE YOU GONNA TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW? NO. 44, I'M WARNING YOU, IF YOU DON'T TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW I'M GONNA TELL THE CHIEF ABOUT YOUR CRYING. - YOU WOULDN'T. - JUST TRY ME. OKAY, HERE IT IS-- IF THE PLANS AREN'T PLANS, THEN THEY'RE PROBABLY- ( gunshot ) - ( 44 groans ) 99, YOU STAY HERE AND TAKE CARE OF 44. - I'M GOING AFTER HIM. - BE CAREFUL, MAX. COME ON, 44, I'LL GET YOU OUT OF THERE. HOLD ON, NOW. BACCARDO! WELL, I SEE YOU CAN WALK. NOT ONLY CAN I WALK, MR. SMART, BUT I CAN ALSO KILL. I'M WARNING YOU, GET AWAY FROM THAT WHEELCHAIR. MISSED! AND YOU'RE ALL OUT OF WHEELCHAIRS. WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT UP YOUR SLEEVE, BACCARDO? I HAD TO ASK. ( grunts ) MAX! BACCARDO! HE'S OUT OF HIS WHEELCHAIR. YES, AND HE'S BEEN ACTING VERY SUSPICIOUSLY. 99, GET HIM INTO HIS CABIN AND KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. I'M GOING TO MAKE A COMPLETE REPORT OF THIS TO THE CAPTAIN AND SEE IF I CAN USE THE SHIP'S RADIO TO CONTACT CONTROL. RIGHT, MAX. - CAPTAIN! - WHAT DO YOU WANT? CAPTAIN, THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. I MUST USE YOUR RADIO. YOU CAN'T GET ANY GOOD STATIONS THIS FAR OUT, MR. SMART. IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP I SUGGEST YOU TAKE A PILL. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, CAPTAIN. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'VE BARGED INTO MY QUARTERS WITHOUT AN INVITATION, SIR. THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND. CAPTAIN, I HAVE TO USE YOUR SHORTWAVE. I MUST CONTACT MY HEADQUARTERS. I BELIEVE I HAVE FOUND THE MAN WHO STOLE THE PLANS FOR THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP! HAVE YOU? HAVE YOU INDEED, SIR? THIS IS MOST INTERESTING NEWS. AND WHO MIGHT THAT PERSON BE? HECTOR BACCARDO, THE CRIPPLED PORTUGUESE POLO PLAYER WHO IS NOT A CRIPPLE, WHO IS NOT PORTUGUESE, AND WHO IS PROBABLY NOT A POLO PLAYER. A VILLAIN! I SENSED IT THE MOMENT I SET EYES ON HIM. MR. SMART, I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE RADIO ROOM MYSELF. ( clip-clopping ) WHAT'S THE MATTER, SIR? WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT? IS IT MY LEG? NO, I'VE SEEN LEGS BEFORE. IT'S THAT WOODEN JOB I'M LOOKING AT. AH YES, A SOUVENIR OF MY YOUNGER YEARS, WHEN I WAS STILL A LAD. YOU'VE HEARD OF THE GREAT WHITE WHALE. THAT WAS DONE BY THE GREAT WHITE WHALE? NO, THAT WAS DONE BY A SMALL BLUE CONVERTIBLE. AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT? YES, AND IT RUINED A PROMISING CAREER AS A TAP DANCER. BUT THAT CLIP-CLOP NOISE-- AH YES, THAT CLIP-CLOP NOISE. YOU MENTIONED THAT BEFORE. WHAT IS IT AGAIN? IT'S THE NOISE THE KILLER MADE WHEN HE WALKED. CERTAINLY, SIR, I AM NOT UNDER SUSPICION. AFTER ALL, I WAS ON THE BRIDGE STEERING THE SHIP WHEN THAT MAN WAS STABBED IN HIS CABIN. THEN HOW DID YOU KNOW HE WAS STABBED? DID I SAY STABBED? I MEANT KILLED. CAPTAIN GROMAN, I THINK YOU AND I BETTER HAVE A LITTLE TALK. YOU FOOL! LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE! YOU'VE RUINED MY MODEL. I'LL HAVE YOU FLOGGED, KEELHAULED- - I'LL SUE YOU! SO THAT'S IT! THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP MADE INTO A MODEL! ALL RIGHT, GROMAN, GET BEHIND THE DESK. COME ON, MOVE OUT. YOU'LL NEVER GET OFF THIS SHIP ALIVE. LISTEN, IF I DON'T GET OFF THIS SHIP ALIVE, YOU'RE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. OF COURSE, I'M IN A LOT OF TROUBLE TOO, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND-- ( phone rings ) EXCUSE ME. MY PHONE IS RINGING. HELLO, 99? DROP THE PHONE, SMART! ( bullet ricochets ) NOW WAIT A MINUTE, GROMAN. YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE OUT OF LINE. DON'T MOVE! THIS IS A .45 CALIBER LEG - AND IT'S LOADED. - OF COURSE! THE OLD GUN-IN- THE-PEG-LEG TRICK. THAT'S THE SECOND TIME I'VE FALLEN FOR IT THIS YEAR. NOW SAY GOODBYE, MR. SMART. - ( groans ) - MING! ( clip-clopping ) - MAX! - ( gunshot ) GOOD SHOT, 99. MAX, IT WAS CAPTAIN GROMAN. YES, ONE OF THE MOST CLEVER AND INGENIOUS VILLAINS I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED. IT WAS HE WHO STOLE THE PLANS, KILLED OUR WATERFRONT CONTACT MAN, MURDERED INSPECTOR SEHOKIAN, ALMOST FED ME TO THE SHARKS, WOUNDED AGENT 44, TRIED TO SHOOT ME WITH ONE LEG AND STAB ME WITH ANOTHER. YOU KNOW, IT'S A SHAME, 99. - ALL THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. - HOW? IF ONLY HE HAD ONLY USED HIS LEG FOR GOOD INSTEAD OF EVIL. CHIEF, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO TAKE THE HELICOPTER BACK? WHY DON'T YOU SAIL BACK WITH US, CHIEF? IT'D BE A NICE REST FOR YOU. NO, I WANT TO GET THAT MODEL BACK TO WASHINGTON. I'LL LEAVE LARRABEE TO WATCH THE OTHER PASSENGERS. LARRABEE, GO BELOW AND KEEP AN EYE ON 'EM. GOOD IDEA, CHIEF. THOSE FREELANCE SPIES ARE REALLY A SHIFTY LOT. AT LEAST WE GOT BACCARDO ON AN ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGE. YES, I GUESS HE THOUGHT I HAD THE PLANS AND WAS JUST WAITING FOR A CHANCE TO STEAL THEM. - HOW'S 44, CHIEF? - OH, HE'S ALL RIGHT. IT WAS ONLY A SUPERFICIAL WOUND. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM AN ASSIGNMENT ON LAND FOR A WHILE. OH, THAT'S GOOD. HE'S A NICE FELLOW. YES, HE'S A GOOD AGENT. IF ONLY HE COULD BREAK THAT CRYING HABIT. YES, I'VE TOLD HIM ABOUT THAT, CHIEF. WATCH IT, CHIEF! THAT'S WHERE I WENT OVERBOARD. OH, REALLY? IT LOOKS SOLID NOW. THEY MUST HAVE FIXED IT UP. THIS IS WHERE THE BULLETS HIT- ( Chief screams ) - ( 99 gasps ) CHIEF! MAX, I DON'T BELIEVE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU DO! I DON'T BELIEVE-- MAX, DO SOMETHING, QUICK! HANG ON, CHIEF! HOLD ON. MAX IS COMING! HERE IT COMES, CHIEF! HOLD ON, CHIEF. THAT'S IT. - HERE WE GO. - Max: HANG ON, CHIEF! - THAT'S IT, CHIEF. - JUST A LITTLE WAYS MORE. HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD GRIP, MAX? MY HANDS ARE SLIPPING, CHIEF. I'VE GOTTA WIPE THEM OFF. GO RIGHT AHEAD, MAX. ( screams ) SORRY ABOUT THAT! MAX! OH... HANG ON, MAX! ( theme music playing ) TENDER SCOUNDREL Mademoiselle! ... Mademoiselle! You forgot something. You forgot to look at me. Yes! Look at me! Is that unusual? Your profile - is now like cameos. I see us together, depicted on the coin. We need, I do not know... We need to create a family home so we were like each other. Yes, a family home. Big fire, big dog lying near the fireplace. Leave me alone! You're so stupid! - Help! Murderer! Let go of me! No, what's that! Go away! Get out! I don't like crazies. Can I give you a lift somewhere? I do not know... - I've the car. Okay, I'm going to Montaigne Avenue . Divine providence sent me. I'm going to George V Avenue. Why are you looking at me? I'm trying to recall your face. I have already seen you somewhere. I'm sure of it. Don't say, don't say where. I'll recall myself. Monte Carlo, on the beach. Not at all, I never been there. However, I've seen you in a bathing suit. You can't forget this. Wait... I remember. Capri! - No. Not either? I have a poor memory! I'm quiting smoking. And you haven't been in Portofino on August 15th? Nope. I was in Deauville. Well, of course Deauville! Polo! You've noticed me riding a mustang. Unfortunately, no. I have never been to a polo. Never been to a polo. Maybe in the casino? This is quite possible. I play there roulette every night. I'll give you an advice. You should not attend such institutions. But you've been there. - Only when necessary. I've invested 50% of my shares in the gambling business. So from time to time I need to check it out. Otherwise empire will collapse. "The reflection of your hair from the light of lamps." "I can still see them." "Heart is still beating." "Memories, memories. What do you want from me?" Damn! Are you drug addict or maniac? Who gave you the right to so cut me off? - A young man... I will not let you! "Young man, young man." There is no young man. You are abusing your age. Because of it I will not hit your face. What year you've got the driving licence, 1900? Well, that's enough. I often dine with the prefect of police. I'll tell him about you, you can believe me... Where are you going? - I'm on the spot. Oh, I'd like to keep you company... Little pampering. But now I have to take care of the car. Life has become a hell. Day passes after day. Let's have dinner together in the evening. What about the prefect of police? - Yeah, I have dinner with him in 24 hours. Bye. - Bye. Oh, shit! Let me pass... So. Let's go back to business. Licence plate number... I hope it's not a stolen car? Okay. I can see, you are a decent man. So, the damages... Headlight. Dent on the right side. Driver after a medical examination... I do not think you will be providing it? No, what would you say? Look at him. He cut me off... and even now he's showing his intelligence. Hold on... I'll show you. I have powerful friends. You will be given the right to drive a scooter. Rotten youth! Bastard! Asshole! Some idiot crashed into me. Registration, car keys... Quickly, give it to me! What happened? Are you angry? Wrong! I should stay away from types like you. Such a jerk! Get out of here! And be quick! I was waiting for something like this. In 3 months didn't sell single car. Well, how could you manage it! Straight world's record. - Look, boss. Such a vehicles are generally very difficult to sell. I'll show you what sells well! You will never sit in the car again! I'll have you blacklisted. You are dangerous! You are intruder! No longer used cars for you! No more! You finished gathering your things? Soon you go away? What are you waiting for? A raise? Rehabilitation? Or kick in the ass? Huh? - No, I wanted to wave... My respects to your wife. - Get out! And never come back here! I have you on the blacklist! Your name will be known to every car dealer! You will be banned from living in the big city! Are you driving to the Champs-Elysees? - Yes. Good. I'm sorry. Hopefully the echo hasn't reach you. Echo of what? - My fight with the owner. I'm a little hasty. I had to throw a cheque into his face. 10 million. - For what? For me to stay. So he could, as before, use my name. He used my name to trade on the black market. Now it's over. Now I will lift up my head. It did not switch to second gear? Listen, your transmission makes a strange sound, a mysterious rustling. Car was in repair for a month. I did not use it at all. Aha! You still have a concern? Again transmission? Everything together. I do not understand. I didn't pass thousand kilometers, yet. Yes, it's not the issue with kilometers. This is a favorite trick of our workshop. I'd have to check your steering and body. You are not the first one who after the repair drives into the ditch. We live in the age of scumbags. I'm sorry, I will drop you off. I am going now back to this scumbag, he will give me back my money... and apologize. Are you going back? - Yeah, this moment. Do not tell him that I said it. My clothes... No, well... Thank you. Hello, booksellers union? Do not hang up, you have a caller. First cabin, sir. Token, madam. Keep the change. - Thank you. And my number, madam? - One moment. Hello. Hello? Hello, dear, it's me. Tony? - Yes. I didn't call you because... Finally decided to call. Youknow,I'mtiredofyourtricks . Comehere,getyourthingsandgetlost. Thank you, sir. - You're welcome, ma'am. Oh, it's you. Well, what? What do you mean? - What about the girl from Hotel Ritz ? Nothing. Simple chick. Those chicks are not in my taste. Look, I'm tired of your moods. She could be easily used. Tomorrow we'll try again. No, thank you. I have enough of that. Monsieur Antoine, should I get you something? I will not eat, I'm dizzy. Oh, Monsieur Antoine, you, on the contrary, have to eat. Nothing would go through my throat. What happened? - Nothing. Talk to me. You have a strange look. I would say hunted. I resigned. - Damned! I'm not used to such a treatment. He started to moralize me. I can not stand it. I'm used to elegance. - Elegance, elegance... No, no, in relation to me there is no "but". Bravo! Madame Aline! Bring us coffee. I'm leaving in 20 minutes. Listen, you hurry too much. In New York, everything is different. Another life. Once you have paid, you are serve immediately. Have you eaten? Yes. - Okay. Pay and we go. You need a ride somewhere? - To you. Oh, no. Not today. I have a guest. Girlfriend. In general... a friend. Mauricette, 20 years old. She sells the flowers. Honest girl. - Really? In short, primitive. Do not deceive yourselve. I know your capabilities. Poor thing does not know she ran into vegetable street vendor. You be careful with your statements. Careful! Where to take? - To Germain. To Germain? - Can you suggest something better? No. - Then let's go. Oh, Tony! Tony! My love! My treasure! Six months without you. I thought I'd go crazy. Germain thought would go mad. My love. Come on. Come on, my treasure. Why are you breathing so heavily? Something prickless? Here prickles. Do you remember that Saturday? When we were going to Barbizon. We thought we would have some fun. I drove the car out of the garage... It felt so good! And then suddenly, bam! Heart attack. Fortunately, it happened at a red light. Two months in the hospital. Thrombosis. And oops... a new heart attack. Freeze. In the House of the Dead. - It can not be! Got released this morning. I could not get up. But I had to see you. - Be prudent. I thought only of you. Constantly calling your name in delirium. Kept awake all the doctors. The nurses told me that. - My dear! Do not choke me! The whole concilium was there. For a week we lived there as brothers and sisters. How hard it was. Let's not waste time. Do you know what we do? You will sleep in the bed and I'm here. No! I can not agree to that! - Do you want a new heart attack? No? Then from today you have a bed rest. Are you on diet? From hell. Grilled meat, fish... Look, you're not forgotten where you can get caviar? - No. I forgot. What you can drink? Probabaly mineral water? Yes, of course. But buy more burgundy. You can not change habits. And also buy some whiskey. Yes, it is a good drug for venous obstructions. Then take a bottle from the cupboard. How strange. It feels if there is not a bar but a medicine cabinet. What a vile thing - life. Our precious patient sleep well? I made you a chocolate. I believe coffee is forbidden? - Forbidden? For what reason? Ah, yes! Sometimes I forget, and I think I'm still healthy. Couldn't get any croissants? I didn't have time to come down. I have to open the store at 8:00 am. You know, now I have the inventory. I'll be back around 1 o'clock.. Make you a breakfast and would leave at 2:00. - You're a saint. No, what's this! No, this can not be! This can not be! Such a surprise. I did not expected that. - What are you babbling about? Fandango - a horse that I know for more than a year. New name. She looks striking. Jockey. St. Matthew. Hardly loaded. Loose ground. Do you know how much they bet on her. 40 to 1. Can you imagine Germain. We just need to fill out pure formality. At the right moment I place 20 sous, and op... I'll break the bank. What bank? You gonna play lotto again? Germain, you really gone crazy? Today is a great day! Failure is prohibited. And why? Because today I will be ruthless. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. The heavy artillery entered the fight. What's in your cash register? - Nothing at all. Bravo! The doctor said to me: no stress. And that's what you get me. Maybe 40,000... No change, though. 40,000. I can imagine my legendary win. Already smiling. Well... no harm in dreaming. My sweetie. How much are the flowers? - They are not for sale. I have to deliver them to that apartment. - How much? I buy them. But sir! - How much? - 6,000 francs. Here are 10,000. Give them to a lady in this apartment. What did you think of now? It's not the best horse. And then, where do I get these 100,000? And your baby has nothing stashed? Flowers bring decent money. - Yes. But we save them. We'll buy a house. Yes, Bobby? Yes. First, we wanted to buy a small store. But then we decided to settle in Roche Mezenc. Well, yes. Her parents live there. Listen, and it's great. This is life. Own house. Own store. Small income. Small breakfast. Small table in a small kitchenette. My friends, you're just morons. Silly you. A lovely place. So this is "the market by the river?" Yes. - You should have seen flower market in San Francisco. Several floors on both sides of the boulevard. And giant flowers. Cactuses like that! Yes, everybody would have laughed at you. Take him away. Fast, get him away from here! I have enough of him. I do not want to listen to this anymore. Such a smart ass annoys me! Well mannered... Oh, no, Mauricette! - Shut up! Leave me alone! I'mtiredof youand yourfriend. You made her angry. Come on, or I gonna burst into tears. Such a smart asses! Justlookat thisidiots... Small ri-ki-ki. - Prick! Well, you got yourself into hornet's nest. Why? - I do not understand you. You're a nice guy. You speak beautifully. Even better than I do. You're just not talking enough. Or say something that brings you harm. Didn't you try to quote Frans? Tried, but never overused. - He was king and god of eloquence. You were talking about my beauty? - Yes. I think you're hurting yourself. Mauricette is not a match for you. Handsome guy like you. With your class... Precisely... with your class. Your style - fashionable lady white phone... crepe de Chine... You think so? - I'm telling you. But, you know... Fashionable lady can be found only in high society. So... credit is needed for the right equipment. Of course, money is not the main thing. We have them. Actually we'd have them in the evening. Well, Fandango. - That's right, Fandango. Heaven itself had sent it to us. Divine providence. You put it all, and then - all women at your feet. Paris at your feet.. - 40,000 cash. 40 to 1 - that's 3,000,000... And between you and me. I foresee a much greater amount. Come on, drive, drive. Madame bets on number 6? Madame loves risk? - I'm sorry? Let me introduce myself: Antoine Marechal owner's son. Can I ask what kind of foe advise you to bet on the "Flower of the Time?" None. I just liked the name of the horse. Funny. Do not you think that horse of that name can throw unexpected trick? Now I talk to you not as society lion, but horse lover. Your only chance: Fandango. You think so? - I'm sure. Hey, it's serious tip. Comebeton it .. - I agree. Number 9, the winner. Number 9, twice winner. Number9 ,20wagers. Number9 ,20wagers. 9th... Where is the ninth? - What? I know, who is now in troubles. Blame Marcel. - Marcel? Oh, believe me. The stable man who works for my father. Tomorrow morning he will be send to the stud farm in Australia. Come on, he's there. Come on! We can't let the bastard go away! - Yes, we must teach him a lesson! Come quickly! Come on let's go. Madam, if you want, I'll give you a ride? You have a car? - Oh, no. I take a taxi. All of these traffic jams drive me crazy. Well? - Yes, I know what you'll tell me. Marcel screw up again. So tomorrow I'll fire him. Sit down, fast. There he goes! Hurry, after him! Bastard! Scoundrel! Scumbag! My friend, do not drive like maniac. Here we go again. Former pilot. Loyal as a dog, but a hothead. I told you not to go crazy. Listen... Do you still need a car? I don't think so. - My friend, you can go for a dinner. Yeah? What the chichi? Bibi! Bibi is here! Wake up. Quickly get up! Come on! What is it? What happened? - Be quiet! Bibi is at the door. - Bibi. What kind of Bibi? Quiet! - Oh, look. You can go crazy. Come on, get dressed quickly. I had such a nice dream. Where are my socks? Here. Is that you, Bibi? - Yes, it's me. Openup,Ihaveasurpriseforyou . Wait a minute! I'm coming. I'm in the bathroom. A second sock? Onthebed. And the shoes? - Keep quiet! I need to sleep. I'm not used to get up at 9:00 am. And my tie? Where's my tie? - Hurry! Who has a birthday today? My little darling. Come here and see. Itwasnoteasy. I had to contact the minister himself. Financial experts objected but I managed to overcome them. Look, it is yours. Thank the Minister, Bibi, and return it. I'll never pass driving exam. Yesterday I failed again. Backing up? This is a curse. My binoculars! Not much you can do. I'm not going to Meuger. My darling. - You're going to ski without your little darling. Hello, cousin! You didn't expect to see me? Monsieur. - Monsieur. Introduce me. Yes, right. Excuse me. Gabriel Dumonceaux, CEO of textilefactoryDumonceauxFabric. My great friend... my cousin... Antoine, from Bourges. AntoineMarechal. Itoldyouabouthim100timestold. - Ah! Yes, yes, of course! Of course. Nice to meet you. So, you are the famous Bibi. Muriel constantly talks about you. She's in trauma. I think, you came to comfort your poor cousin? To console? Why? I failed the driving exam again. For the third time. What's wrong? - It is impossible to go reverse. Of course, they always ask just that. Anyone can drive a car. Big, small cars. Look who's talking - you ride in a taxi. You should tell this to reporters. You make me laugh. I've operated many European firms. Monza, Monte Carlo, 24 hours. I'm not talking about my U.S. companies. They are my beloved children. For example, company "Jimmy". Have you heard of her? Wow, I don't know anything. It looks like you don't know. We rarely see each other. - If we had seen each other more often you would already know how to drive. Now I take everything into my own hands. In a week you'll get your licence. - In a week... Too late. Bibi is leaving to Meuger in the evening. Nothing can be done. I'm not going to enjoy the snow. I would be stuck in cheap club. Sleep in a dormitory. Noonewouldsee me. - We'll start learning immediately! We're family, right? She's like a child. Would you go alone in the train without protection? Where those pimply students will be hitting on you. Well, it's not! Thank you! Not a word more. Tonight you're coming by car to your country house. - But how? Together with your cousin. - I'm sorry? Oh, no, this is not possible, dear Bibi. I'd love to, but... After all, you know that's life. The work different circumstances... obligations. It takes a lot of time. Maybe I can squeeze a week before qualifying in Mexico. But no more! You see, everything is just perfect. - What day is today? Saturday. - We can't go. - Why? Banks are closed. - So what? I didn't expect this trip and didn't bring any cash. For Gabriel Dumonceaux banks are always open. Due to banks our life becomes much more practical. How much do you need? Is 500,000 enough? Well, then. I'll call Beatrice and tell her about you. Thank you. Excellent. Till next meeting. Wait... You forget the binoculars. True. You cousin is cute. Do you have snow chains? - Why? The roads are slippery up there. - Have you ever heard about snow rally. I have won three of them the past year. Bravo! No one amused me so much in a long time. Tony! Stop it! What are you doing! Well, Tony. That's right. You performed real rally in the snow. Listen, you've never heard of skid... Why are you laughing? - You've funny sweater. Absolutely incongruous colors. - This is intentional. You know, when I'm down there, I could be seen from far away. At 12, I've received "Golden chamois". 21 planning. 21 obstacles. And we're done. Agreed? - Good. What is it? Oh! What is it? Disperse! Disperse! Hey! What's wrong with you? My God, what is it? I thought you really received the "Golden chamois." Damned skis! It is better to go down the mountain by car or taxi. At least the legs will be intact. Yousee,nature isa greatthing. Just think, for years I destroy.. ...my nervous system. Damage coronary vessels. And all for what? For some extra tens of millions per month. And just one-hour flight keeps us away from such a beauty in here. Hey, Tony! Gabriel, you are here, too! What a surprise! How funny. Antoine Marechal. This is my wife, Beatrice. Antoine Marechal - financial expert with a great future. Now he is studying the Scottish market. My cousin Muriel. Good afternoon. - Spouses Dumonceaux. Antoine often told me about you. I even remember your name. So charming... Put another two seats. Yes, we insist. You are not in Edinburgh. - In Edinburgh...? Ah, yes. Well, of course. Scottish market. I left it to accompany Muriel. You stay in a hotel? - No, we rented a house. House - is to strong word. More likely, miserable little shed. But I love it. Yes, it reminds him heroic times. Yes, a lifestyle that I once knew. Loneliness. Wildlife. Climbing. How exciting. - Excited, madam. Excited is better word. My former friends and Milale my spiritual father, taught me everything. Everything except position of "backword cancer" which I had invented. - You... "backword cancer"? Forhimthisisa secondnature. You know, Gabrielle the day after tomorrow Monsieur Marechal leaves us. - Work, madam. Work. We can't let the poor boy go. Scottish sheeps can wait. In general, yes. After all, you come here only for a week. Earlier than the end of the quarter we can hardly wait for your results. My dear Gabriel, at the end of the quarter I will be in Guatemala. Planning phosphates. Then Moscow. Problems with corn. Youmustslowldown,MonsieurMarechal. Call me Tony. - Only in exchange for a promise. I'll call you Tony, and you will stay here for another week. Agreed. Oh, no, you! What kind of a fairy tale? Guatemala... Moscow... It's a nightmare! You shouldn't say that he's financial expert. Couldn't imagine more stupid. I had to come up with something that would impress my wife. Most of your wife is impressed... Better for me to remain silent. So we have a deal? Bravo. Hey, Gabrielle! Yes! Thank our friend Tony. For what? Today, he will come to us for a party. We'll be well entertained. Damn! I dropped it. Till the evening, then. - Yes, until the evening. God knows what. Monsieur ready for anything, posing as gigolo. I warn you... if you again will behave like a boy... Enough! No more crazyness. 7 hours behind the wheel plus 3 hours of skiing. And now the scene of jealousy. My nerves are not made of steel. I'm out of the game. Enough. I go back to Scotland. Can't be! You really started to believed in these Scottish sheeps? You see, I finally got caught in your lies. Tahiti. Oh, Tahiti! How I love this island! Tell me, my dear. Your guest list is not closed yet? No. - Am I on it? - None. - Poor me, so unlucky! I wish I could devote you my new creation. What a bitch! Oh, my dear! That's you! Not much fun in here. Notevenroomfor sex . What do you say? Not all of the guests arrived. We are still waiting for some. - Anyway, it's success. Thank you. We stick around for 15 more minutes and leave. -Yes,deadlyboredom. Where did you fly away for 3 days? Why did you run away, without telling me? Don't you want to? You know, Josette, Tyrol for me... Call me Joe and tell me you're... And your friend Antoine hasn't showed up, yet? And... there, he is! Who is he? - Antoine Marechal. Exceptionally talented financial expert. Golden brain. Yes, it works for me. Now he is engaged in development budgets to make your shakes. Freezer's broken. OK, so those are steroids. But how do we know Little Billy delivered them the night of the murder? Dixon said there was a brand new shipment. Billy must've delivered them that night. Billy! Detective sergeant Spears. I need to ask you a few more questions. - You wanna talk, step in the cage. - Let's go, get out. What you gonna do, shoot me? You're a person of interest in a murder case. Let's go. You step up, and I answer every question and talk as long as you want. You don't, I lawyer up and you never get the answers you're looking for. You want something from me, huh? Come and get it. There are easier ways to get a suspect's DNA, but... they're not as much fun. (rap music) Should we let him shower before we bring him in? (panting) Yeah, really appreciate you cooperating with us to help us nail down the guy who killed Jared and Stacy Cooper. So you know who it was, huh? - How well do you know Aaron Dixon? - I see him at the club. - Yeah, we think Dixon did the murders. - Nothing surprises me. Dixon, he's trying to box you in for the murders. Yeah, I know. He sent us to, uh... Clover Harcourt? And she said that you and her had a thing... Clover? Never nothing serious. We're both... free agents. Hmm. I just gotta tie up a few loose ends here. (She clears her throat.) So we got this sworn statement from Clover and she says you made death threats? I say some things in the moment, you know how you do. Uh... Clover also said that you made death threats to Jared Cooper? Yeah, well... So you did. And we know that you gave Jared Cooper steroids acquired from Dixon. We know that. Your man Spears tell you that? I mean, he would know. I sold him some, too. And you dropped the steroids off to Jared the night he and Stacy were killed. My job is hard. Murderers getting smarter all the time, no witnesses, doing a really clean job of cleaning the murder weapon... It's almost like we got nothing to go on. But... you'd be surprised how many smart murderers forget to wear gloves when they load their guns. And DNA on bullets, that's a lot to go on. I'm thinking we're gonna find your DNA on those bullets, Billy. And we've got your DNA on Detective sergeant Spears, in your blood from the fight. I'd say today's a pretty good day. You think I need this? Seriously, do you think I need this? Sir, I really... King, did you know that Spears had a relationship with this Little Billy? - It wasn't relevant, sir. - It is now. You've charged him with murder. Spears, I'm going to ask you once, did you buy steroids or any controlled or illegal substance from that man? - No. - And you'll testify under oath to that fact? - Yes, sir. - And that testimony will be truthful? - Chief, you've asked him more than once. - Yes, sir. Billy is lying, sir. - And your case is solid? - Planned and deliberate. First degree times two. Then you bury him, I need some good press. Get the hell out of here. - Jess... - You better not. (Ding! ) That was such a case... What are you going to do? Good night, girls, see you next week. (girls giggling) Ah, there she is. Hi. This is very unprofessional. I'm just a piano player, Your Honour. You should put your hair up. I should cut it all off. No, you shouldn't! I haven't done this since... well... maybe ten. Well, sometimes you need to go back to go forward. (steps approaching) Ah, David, this is Jessica King. The Detective. - Hi. - Hi. Yeah, don't get your hopes up, he just got married. - Congratulations. - Thanks. And he and Fraser are gonna be very happy as soon as Fraser gets off his fat arse and gets a job. Okay, Margie, we should... - Yes, okay, fine. - Would you like to begin? Yeah. Um, you tell anyone who I am and what I do, I'll shoot you. Okay? Seriously. ♪ (police siren) you might even laugh from it. You will say that something so strange is impossible. But this is certainly my mother's story. was a wolf-man. My mother was a student in a national university on the outskirts of Tokyo. Her scholarship covered her school fees. And for her living expenses she had a part-time job at the same time. but also on miscellaneous subjects. they had no knowledge about Areté. my mom saw my father for the first time. taking notes without a textbook on nothing but a notebook. She thought he was very different from the other students. Please wait. This is the attendance ticket. If you don't sign and turn it in you won't be marked present. So... I'm... Not a student here. What? I won't be coming again. Who's that? Please wait. but at that lecture you didn't have a textbook so I thought it would be a bit hard to study. Why don't we share mine? Welcome. It will be done by Friday. Thank you for your patronage. Sorry for the wait. Welcome. Let's be careful with this. this way. Where should I place this? here. Come in. come. and the sophist Lycon. but Anytus was the one behind the prosecution. What do you do for fun? What kind of food do you like? What kind of person do you love? Why are you called "Hana"? My name? Yeah. When I was born the cosmos flowers in the backyard were blooming. they were blooming naturally. When my father saw them he immediately thought: that won't fade away. then we'll be able to overcome almost anything. I was smiling the whole time. My relatives were all thinking "What an indiscretion". That made me really angry. But... Maybe that was an indiscretion after all... it wasn't. I'm glad. but each one is different inside. and homes with only elders. It would be nice to have a home. Saying "I'm home" when you arrive. and sit yourself comfortably on a chair. That would be great. I would build a shelf. Fill it with books and then build another shelf. your own home. And I'll say "Welcome home" when you arrive. Hana... What? There's something I must tell you... Speak your mind. The truth is... Let's do this again tomorrow. Okay. Hana... Hana. I messed up. It's something I never told anyone before. because you might leave me. I should have told you sooner. I should have shown you. Shown me? Could you close your eyes for a moment? A bit longer. Can I open them? Hana... What do I look like? and attacking people was known as just a legend. The world is full of things unknown to me. that's probably what my mother thought. Did I shock you? Should we stop meeting? But you're trembling. Are you scared? I'm not. Because it's you. that went extinct about a hundred years ago. The last being that inherited a blood mix of humans and wolves. the history of their family's destruction. and died after. faced many troubles and grew up into an adult. He got a driver's license and moved to the city to look for a job. and had no one to look back on. Until that point he had taken care to live in secret and in hiding. That's what my father said. Gentle to Heart and Body Natural Birth Mom gave birth to me in that small apartment. It was a snowy day. only by themselves... the doctors would be shocked. I'm glad she was born safely. But things are just starting now. Will she grow to be a gentle child? She will probably be a very smart kid. I wonder what kind of adult she'll be. I want her to work on whatever she likes. to become a happy and healthy child. We'll watch over her until she grows up. Yeah. My little brother was born in the spring of the following year. It was a rainy day. my father had disappeared. I don't know... what my father was thinking that day. It was probably the instinct of hunting food for the baby at work. something nutritious to eat. [TN: That's a driving license] I leave the children in your care. My mother heard it like he said that. Leave it to me. I'll raise them well. After that I don't remember my mother ever thinking about anything serious. Rice! Yuki. Rice! Just a bit more. Rice! Yuki! She said that whenever I got angry and grumbled my fur would grow out and I would turn into a wolf. I guess it can't be helped. Have a biscuit before lunch. crying out and searching for food from morning until night. I was very different from my brother who ate little and was weak. My mother took a suspension from college to raise us. She also had to quit her part time job. That was close. The small savings my father left us were enough to sustain our living. That was close. she was wondering whether to have us live as humans or wolves. She was at a loss over it. Oh my. so she had to study everything by herself in books. she had to breastfeed for two whole hours. Whenever her breast didn't produce milk she used skim milk instead. Living with Wolves she stayed up all night holding him and caressing his back. Because of that my mother would always be dozing off once in a while. It's alright. even if she just closed her eyes for a short moment. Mommy. What? The problem was when we got sick. Yuki? Yuki? Yuki! She was conflicted between going to the pediatrics or the vets... My child ended up eating drying agent by mistake. She is two years old. she vomited. There was no blood in it. It has "Silica Gel" written on it. But... Are there any complications? Huh? Her appetite? I'm hungry. I see... It's alright... My mother regrets never asking how my father was raised when he was a kid. Walk. that's... Walk! You've been in bad health the past few days. So we... WALK! I get it. Gee... hide your ears. let's go for a walk. But watch your ears! They are showing again! Okay! Good afternoon. How cute. he called you cute. S- sorry. No... But that wasn't the only problem. What time do you think it is? Stop with the noise! I'm so sorry. for crying out loud! I'm truly sorry for this. Teach them some discipline! there. It's alright. It's written in the lease that pets are prohibited in the apartment. We don't have any. Don't lie. We'll find out about it. you're more than welcome to go someplace else you prefer. From the child consultation center? the neighbors are worried the children are in peril. What do you mean? Our research shows your children never had a medical checkup did they? It's alright. They are healthy. we would at least like to take a look at them. that's... It's just for a second. It is just to confirm what you are saying is true. T- that's not possible. we'll have no choice but to suspect you of ill-treatment and neglect. Please go away! Slooow! Hey. mom? What do you want from now on? or wolves? to someplace you can choose whatever you want. We'll start with the vacant houses by the town hall. but they don't stay long. there isn't much around here. it's a two and a half hour one-way bus and train ride. A round trip is five hours! Even if you say you want to raise your kids in a good environment... I'd say the city is a much more convenient place. It's huge... the price for repairs would be insane. Since it's an abandoned house... it's okay to keep your shoes on. This place is practically dilapidated. But at least the electricity still works. And the stream water hasn't dried up. And the things from the shed are also okay to use. right? this place is not suited for self-sufficiency. Animals come down from the mountain and damage the fields. they'd just eat them all. The houses in this area became empty because the humans around here were driven out by them. So the neighborhood? Neighborhood? No one ever comes down so you won't see them. Would you like to see someplace else? Around the village would be more practical... I'll take it. What? I'm taking this house. Why? Where are we? Our new house. It's slanting! ants! What is this? ! Step! Step! Help! So? Do you guys like it? I like it! Let's go back. She wanted someplace where there was nobody living around. She was a bit eccentric. And her husband? Who knows. Any income? Who knows. So how does she plan on providing for her and her children? Gramps Nirasaki! Please be gentle on them this time! 3... 2... look! Come down. Come down. Here. come. Here. Age 4 Age 5 Thank you very much. Come again. Good evening. Good evening. come here. Is that the woman from the rumors? From now on I'll have to start saving as much as possible. S-a-v-i-n-g? That means we will have to do things like planting our own vegetables. too! okay? Okay. I'll take these. Sure. Those too. Yuki! Yuki and Ame being wolf children is our little secret. Yeah. everyone would be shocked. That's why they could never turn into wolves in front of other people. Right? It's our promise. Got it. One more thing. don't be arrogant with them. Why? Because that would make you father sad. Right? You get it? We get it! We won't forgive you!" said the very angry villagers as they chased the wolf with their guns. I'm sorry! I won't do it anymore" cried the boasting wolf while running away. Why? Why indeed? Hey! Excuse me. Huh? May I take the fallen leaves from the woods? What? The fallen leaves. You don't have to ask anybody to take those. Thank you very much. How long will she keep it up? She has been quite the talk around the convenience store and the karaoke place. I don't doubt it. This time for sure. Mom... Ame! What happened? A tortoiseshell cat. it had its eyes on him since he's weak. Those are just scratches. They are nothing You won't survive with those! Yuki. Will you comfort me? You will be alright. You sure will. not even for a boar! You saw a boar? I did! I also saw a monkey and a wild goat. But I wasn't scared at all! It was fun when I started chasing them and they ran away! Also- Yuki. when I peed... you can't be self-important around other animals. But... Please. Okaaay. Thank you. Can you comfort me again? it's fine. But surely... How does a wolf child become an adult? Yuki! Wait. Pick me up. Already? You're slow. Hurry up! Wolves start hunting only four months after they are born. First they start with small game like rats. they team up with adult wolves and... TEAM! No way... I didn't want to anyway. Don't go too far away. Sure. let's go back? Ame. Do you think we can eat this plant? Hm... Got it! Caught it! look Ame. It's alright. It will be fine. look! It's a great cormorant. There's a stream on the other side and... Mom... Why are wolves always the bad guys? Is it because... of that picture book? Everyone hates him and he gets killed at the end. That's why I... I hate being a wolf. I see. But... Your mother loves wolves. even if just by herself. Moom. Mooom. What happened? They are withering again. A disease? In all of them? No way... Mom. What's going to happen to us now? It's no use. Your mother still has to study much more. Will you help me again? I will. Thank you. Get inside. Sure. Good evening. but with all the commotion... right? Even though I did everything in the books it just ends up failing. isn't it? Full of nature. What's so natural? will it? it's always the same. Isn't that what you were thinking? T- that's... Don't smile. Why are you smiling? Smiling won't do anything about it. That man is scary. No. I don't know how to do this and I'm hopeless. Even though you're an adult? I regret not asking your father about more various things. This is bad. So bad. Good afternoon. Um.... Here. This is to you. What is it? Seed potato. And you plant these in the fields? You can use it to do many more things. but don't worry. That's just his personality. that was my fault. Good afternoon! I'm sorry. It's alright. Here. Old man Nirasaki. Thank you for the seed potatoes. Do you plan to let them go to waste? Start over from the earth. You can't dig like that. I'm sorry. Er... What about fertilizers? Did you bury the dry leaves there? Yes. Then you don't need it. work the soil up here too. It doesn't need to go that far. It's just for me and my two children to eat. Didn't you hear me? I did. Create the rows. Yes. Leave more space between them. Yes. make them higher. Yes. plant the cut part facing down. just leave them. Um... Thanks for teaching me so much... are you okay? Good afternoon. Come here. Huh? just come here. Hm? come on. you. Yes? Those are chamomile and cabbage. it will make a taste bugs don't like. don't! Celery is much better with cabbage. Not it isn't. For beginners this is better. no. Is chamomile even gonna fill anyone's stomach? not deep. You're wrong. You first need to soak the hole with water. no. you need to plant first. wrong. You can sprinkle the fertilizer this way. If you add too much the insects will flock here. No. Give me that. Be more daring with it. Wrong. You need to add just a bit. You will definitely go wrong if you follow his advice. That's your advice! What? Vinegar wood polish? It's made from charcoal-roasted smoke. Then then treated poultry manure is added to it. Thanks for everything. thank you. Sorry for intruding so inadvertently and surprising you. no. It must have been hard to work a land so raw. so I had to study everyday. but they always gave up and went back soon after. Were there others as young as me? they were old men who had retired. It's funny how mental and weak they were. this is no land that makes living off it easy. The drainage is bad. There's a ton of snow. We have to help each other. We thought you weren't one to socialize with your neighbors. There aren't many young mothers around here. So it's really reassuring to have one more of us here. Ask anything you want. then... What? You live off your savings? ! but they will soon run out. It's hard to find a job. Everyone leaves their children at the nursery school and goes far away to work. What kind of place is a "nursery school"? Why don't Yuki and Ame go there? That's because... Yuki wants to go to the nursery school! No way. I will go! No way! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will... I'LL GO! I want to! I want to! I want to! I want to! hurry up and eat your food. I know it's about our secret. But I'll be careful. But you see... I'll be careful. Y - Yuki... do you own a dog? err... Well... Isn't that a wolf? darling! It's a wolf! that's not... there are no more wolves in Japan. That's a shepherd mix. Hana-chan? Ain't I right? ain't I? What? The dog is gone. good afternoon. Yuki-chan. Aren't you sociable today? Your clothes are just like your dog's. Isn't she cute? Y - Yuki... Hana-chan? Hello! Hello! I wonder where grandpa Nirasaki is... They were grown quite nicely. It's thanks to everyone's help. so this will be very helpful. What do you mean damaged? A boar. take these. This much! ? Those boars... I'll thankfully accept these. he dug everything up. It seems that this year he even went as far as going to Sakei's rice field. this is in exchange. It's heavy. Hana-chan's field was the only one that the animals didn't damage. That's a miracle on this mountain. Maybe there's a trick to it? I didn't do anything. We would all like to hear it. What does "trick" mean? Pee! that Yuki-chan. By any chance... What? No... It's nothing. Thank you very much. It's okay. It's in exchange for the potatoes. It has been a long time since we had any eggs. That's good to hear. Tell me if you run out of them. Oh. That's SO cute. Huh? Huh? But that's so big. I can't take it. It's alright. Don't mention it. It's from a guy who had it sitting in his shed. but... Take it. Besides if we take it back the old man would be angry at us. Old man"? it's getting old. He is totally in love with you. He's over 90. he gets everyone involved... You idiot! You shouldn't be saying things like that. So that's it... I finally understand the reason why the field had to be bigger. I don't like it. Huh? Why are you always smiling like that? Don't laugh! What's so funny about it? Even though I moved here to escape from people's eyes... I ended up getting a lot of help from everyone at the village. but somehow it seems like I can keep on going. Cool! M- mo- mom! Ame! Ame is-! M- mom! Ame! Ame! Ame! Ame! M- o- mom... Ame! Mom... Ame... Ame! Ame! Ame! Open your eyes! Ame! Ame! Ame! Open your eyes... Ame... Mom... It hurts... Ame! I found a crested kingfisher. It was a really beautiful crested kingfisher. Today even I felt like catching one myself. You know what? It was totally different from before. I wasn't scared. I felt like I could do anything for a moment there. And then... Why are you crying? What are we doing here? Later my mother said that she had never been so scared in her life. turned into someone completely different. it was inevitable. I started following every single order to the full extent. I could go. However... No matter what happens... I won't become a wolf! I know that already. It's a promise. I can manage it. three octopuses". What's that? It's a good luck charm so you don't become a wolf. Good luck charm? three octopuses". Three.. three octopuses. three octopuses". three octopuses". three octopuses". Hurry up! three octopuses". three octopuses". three octopuses". It was the first time in my life I was surrounded by so many people. when I got there I was unsure if I could actually do it. But that was only at the start. I'm leaving. See you! take care. Yeah. Shino-chan! Good morning. Yuki-chan. I saved you your seat. Thank you. First Grade who knows the answer to this? Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! no running! Yuki-chan! do your best! You're fast. Amazing Yuki-chan. Only you could do that! Thank you very much. Good luck. Thanks for waiting. Job offers – Part-time That is...

Welcome to Niikawa's forest nature observatory. Thanks for welcoming us here. and preserve the wild life. These three pillars are what we ask of volunteers while they're here. a specialist must be simultaneously proficient in all of them. we are taking applications for an assistant to the busy nature observers. That is indeed the case. though. but the study required for that and training expenses are the only implications. The hourly wage of a part-time high school student is best suited for you. Even so... Do you want the job? Er... I heard you keep a wolf here... It's a timber wolf. He is quiet. It's because of his age. could you... Excuse me for a moment. Nice to meet you. I came here because there's something I'd like to ask you. This boy is the son of a wolf. His wolf father passed away. but I don't know how to raise a wolf child. What did you do to become an adult wolf? Won't you tell me about the time you were raised in the woods? sorry about that. A wealthy person got special permission to acquire and raise him. so they brought him to us. Although he was originally born at a zoo in Moscow. He isn't a wild animal? It's rare to see wild wolves at zoos. it's taken as a foster child. we take in hurt wild birds and raccoon dogs. After that we deal with healing them. but will you be okay doing it with me? about the mountains and nature. That's the first time I saw a real one. A wolf? Was dad like that? No. Not at all. Good. Why? Because that guy looked very lonely. I wanted to meet my dad. too. I underwent a big impact. yours looks great. Keno-chan. I found a four-leafed clover. Me too! Yuki-chan! Did you find anything? Yeah. Look! Just for fun I caught a rat snake and wrapped it around my arm but there were no girls like me in school. this is my mother's jewelry. So pretty! She got this one on her last birthday. How nice. show us your treasure chest! Sure! what is inside? Look. There were no other girls who would happily gather small animal bones and reptile dry skins besides me. I realized. I was so embarrassed that it got me anxious. I reached a decision: From now on I would act as graceful and girly as I could. Don't laugh! I'm troubled with all seriousness! Yuki. I don't want people to think I'm a weirdo. I guess I'll have to help you. I remember I got really happy that my mother started sewing a new dress just for me. Because of this I stopped feeling out of place in the middle of the class. I started getting along much better with my friends. Good morning! Morning! Yuki-chan! They're wonderful! I say that this dress saved me. Next year it was really hard to get Ame to go to school. You hear? three octopuses". The school is this way! first graders! second graders! first graders! second graders! second graders! third graders. third graders! fourth graders! third graders! Good morning. Ame-kun. Is today a holiday at school? No. So you're ditching? Yeah. You can come here whenever you want. Sorry for the inconvenience. This is the research center. Here you can also see a Mountain Frog that has a tail. Hana-chan! Can you help us here? Suure! your attention. Let me introduce you the new exchange student. His name is Fujii Souhei-kun. introduce yourself. I'm Fujii. It's nice to meet you. too. do you have a pet dog? Huh? Why? you smell like a furry animal. I don't have one. Really? That's weird. I was pretty sure you did. What is it? no. It's just this smell. A smell? Of what? Maybe it's just my imagination. Which is it... it's this one! are you serious? Yuki-chan. too. Souhei-kun is really funny. I have to return this book. What's up with her? She not always like that. Hey Yuki. About that... about that... Hey Yuki! Yuki! Hey Yuki! Be honest with me! What? Did I do something to you? No you didn't. So you don't like me because I'm an exchange student? Is that it? I told you it's not that. Then why are you avoiding me? I'm not. three octopus. three octopus. Three.. Hey! Wait up! three octopuses. three octopuses. three octopuses. three octopuses. Get away! Hey you. Don't get any closer! What are you doing? ! Don't touch me! Yuki! Yuki! Hana-chan. Telephone. Thanks. Hello. I'm sorry to call you in the middle of work. Do you know how much blood he lost from his head? It was just my ear. Yuki. No matter what I ask her she doesn't say a word. Did you really hurt him? Did you apologize to him? Apologize. Apologize right now. I'm sorry. I have no excuse for what happened. Souhei-kun's mother so... And what if it had drained all the blood from my son's head? And what if by some chance he becomes deaf in that ear? What a child does is a parent's responsibility! Does taking out a loan or selling your house make up for that? ! so... And what makes you think that's the case? If you don't listen I'll have to... A wolf. It was a wolf that did it. It was a wolf that did this. Souhei. What are you talking about? Souhei... Souhei? They didn't catch the culprit. she has been different lately. Yuki-chan would never do that. It's obvious that it was her. So the teacher... What happened with Souhei-kun? He left early. How come? Because he got hurt. How did he get hurt? you see... Who hurt him? Well... Yuki-chan! Yuki-chan. I knew it. Was it really her? I'm a detective. Stop that! Quiet down! Everyone quiet down! It didn't work... The good luck charm; no matter how many times I repeated it. They... should expel me already. Will we be unable to live at that house anymore? I'm sorry... I'm sorry! Mom... I'm sorry! there. Souhei-kun? A printed paper. From Souhei-kun. From Souhei-kun. Souhei-kun. Today she went to play at Shino-chan's house. I see. Wait a minute. You must live pretty far away. Thanks for coming here everyday. I don't like that Yuki is not going to school anymore. didn't you? What did you mean by it? That was... I mean.. but... For a moment there I'm pretty sure I saw a wolf. it hurt me. That's why I said that a wolf did it. Which means it wasn't Yuki's fault. But everyone says I'm talking nonsense with that... I see... Can I ask you one more question? Do you hate wolves? Not really. Neither do I. Hey... Wanna see it? Isn't it cool? Want to touch it? Doesn't it hurt? Itches a bit. Let's go! I'm going. Where are you going? To my teacher's home. Who is your teacher? My teacher is... My teacher. I get it. Will you be okay on your own? Yeah. Take care. Sure. Don't stay out late. Sure. Where's Yuki-chan? She went back to school today. That's great. What about Ame-chan? some times not. That's also good for him. Guys who don't go to school since elementary school are very promising. Edison and I were like that. Now he is talking nonsense again. who lives up in the mountain? The mountain? I thought he meant the old man but... Let me see. Is there anyone on the mountain during this busy farming season? My teacher knows everything. Everything about the mountain. I never thought you would get along with older people... Next time bring him here. besides... My teacher doesn't meet with humans. He doesn't go down to the village like the bears and boars. But I guess he might like to meet my mother. My teacher is the master in charge of this whole mountain's territory. Thanks for always taking care of Ame. You can get in now. I want to bring Yuki to my teacher's place too. I'm improving my hunting technique. There's a trick to run at full speed in the forest. There's also a way to read the terrain. I've been studying a lot. also about territory and how to respect them. There's no way I'm going. Why? And why don't you go to school anymore? Because the mountain is much more fun. There are many things I still have to learn there. It's better not to learn those. Why? Just start going to school! No way. Why not? Because I'm a wolf. You're human. We're wolves. I decided I'm never turning into a wolf again. Why? How come? Because I'm human! Okay? I'm HUMAN! Why do you say that? why". you're a wolf. you... Shut up! You don't know anything! What? ! I'll never forgive you if you don't come to school tomorrow. I won't go! Then I won't forgive you! And I won't go! You wanna fight? What? What's that noise? Yuki! Ame! Stop it you two! Yuki! Ame! Yuki! Ame! Ame? Both Yuki and Ame started walking on their separate paths. why do I feel this uneasy? why? was full of many record-setting heavy rains. Ame started going to the mountain more frequently. would affect his teacher and the mountain flora and fauna. He seemed very worried about that. Ame! Where have you been all this time? You're cold. I'll warm up the bath for you. My teacher... Hurt his leg and can't walk anymore. He... might die soon. Someone has to take the place of my teacher and carry on his duties. Ame! Don't go to the mountain anymore. Okay? You're still only 10. You're just a kid. you're... Please. Don't go to the mountain anymore. It's your mom's... wish... I'm going now. I'm going now. Hey! Shoot it in! shoot it! pass! do you know? Know what? I overheard my parents talking about it... Yeah? Souhei-kun's mother... She is getting married. Really! ? How come? Because she is beautiful! Then Souhei-kun will get a new father. That's great. they said. Really? Why? Why? Really? Yes. This is our secret. Alright! It got in! Yay! What's the score now? No way! shoot... Good morning. but from the evening to late tonight a strong rain is forecast.. It's humid today. Yuki. Stay home today. Stay with mom. Why? At least spoke to Vicki last night, at least you two like, you're going to like, gunna be? Yeah. Vicki is just, she's a proper twat, she's an idiot. It's a little bit like the conflict between Bobby and Cindy. Bobby fuckin' hates Cindy. Malibu Mandy's trying to sort it out, she's like Bobby listen, I think if we talk to Cindy, you're gunna like her. Why don't we just let her come in the pink jeep and we'll all cruise down the beach together? [Phone rings] Hello? Hi, good morning, It's Anna. Yes. I've got a client today, who needs spray tan. It's going to be Jay, Becca, Ricci and Charlotte going to graft today. So, they're going to have the hangover shakes, and whoever the spray tanning is goin to look like they've got some sort of skin disease. I don't want to leave, and go party. And, we've got to go get ready immediately! Ugh, God! What a surprise! Who's at work? Oh, the girl who feels down, let's all just pick on her. [Music] How could he get back on it now, couldn't ya? How could you be thinking about a drink after last night? I feel really sorry for Charlotte, she's so down in the dumps. Gary's just fucked her in the head completely. [Music] Hi everyone! You're a sprayer, you settle right? What you doing? You, he puts the Vaseline on. I make sure everything's running smoothly. I feel sick at how he's doing this again. This is the last time I let Gary break me heart. Is there any more wine? Give me some of yours. Fuckin can't believe Charlotte gets fucking pissed because of Gary. Pretty much only three things left that can happen; let go of the relationship, carry on the way they are, or end it. And, for me the best thing to do is just end it. Oh shit. What's just happened there? [Music] New Castle has such a great nightlife. Everyone just wants to go out and get smashed, every single night. So, no matter what night you go out, it's going to be good. We're back in New Castle, which means, lashes, hair extensions, makeup, decent dresses, tash on, let's get mortal! [Shouting in unison] Gan On! Gan On! [Music] Vicki's got a boyfriend, but it's not him that I'm worried about, but I don't want any bad feelings between me and Jay. So, I prefer to clear before diving in there with Vicki. I respect the fact that he's come up to us, but, just be careful because you could just spend this next six weeks arguing your time, and cock block ya. I think she's gorgeous and she's a lovely person as well. I think me and her could work, if we got together. [Music] I'm a bit pissed, but Gary's thinking with his dick again. It's a brain of it's own. Charlotte's mortal again, she has no filter, she doesn't know when to stop. If I'm out, and you're in the middle of graffing some bird, if someone comes and interrupts me half way through that, saying come look at Charlotte. Like two seconds - I'll be back in ten minutes, I'm just going to look after this person, I've been bangin, who I don't really like, but do you know what I mean? I couldn't pull it, I couldn't go home with her because you're too pissed, so I'm cock-blocked both ways. Charlotte mortal again. Getting really upset, I feel really sorry for the girls, because they constantly have to look after her. You can't blame guys all the time, it's not him to blame at all, Charlotte's got herself drinking so much. She keeps going back, she's going to keep getting hurt. You don't need to keep looking after someone that keeps putting their self in that scenario, when she knows what the crack is. Who else is going to look after her if I don't? I'm sorry but you wouldn't drink so much. You could look after her! Ricci you might as well just suck it off and pie it off now because he's not going to bang Vicki. If I didn't take her home, you take her home! Yes. Exactly. It's just going to cause massive arguments. It's just going to be me, watching exactly what I went through, and it's starting already. You don't see me babysitting, from, from my point of view. Do you think she just started that when she meant us? She's been doing this for years, Rick. It's ridiculous. I'm getting played like a game of Monopoly, and I'm just letting him lead us on this marry dance all around the garden, oh hang on a second, I'm in the fuck hut. Deep down she likes me, I know she does. And, when you've got that in your head, knowing that that girl likes you, ahh- you twist and turn things the way you want it to go- [Music] Rick and Vicky are in there, hey? Vick's got a boyfriend, she wouldn't do that. I think Ricci's thinking, get it on when I'm going to get something, yeah man, this fuck hut's for one reason only. There's no reason for them to even be in there. They've just met three days ago, why the fuck they in the fuck hut? We're all thinking, not a chance, not at all, Vicki doesn't bang. Jay has spent about 10 years trying to bang it, and nothing happened, so he's just wasting his time there. I'm flirting with Ricci like its going out of fashion. And, I know it's wrong, because I've got a boyfriend. She's havin none of this, just like, what you do with him? If me boyfriend knew that I was like laying in bed with Ricci talking, especially in a room entitled the fuck hut, he'd be pretty angry. If anyone got rejected for having a kiss and the girl is supposed to be getting with, it's just like it's an absolute joke! D'ya know what I mean? it's like a slap in the face? Ricci, please. Ricci! [exhales loudly] [Music] I'm so pissed, the girls put us to bed, it's happening again with these brain waves from the past, and I get up, and there I am, I'm in his room. I put myself to bed, and Charlotte goes in my room. To get into bed with us, she knows exactly what she's got herself in for. And, then I'm in the bed for a little while, just sleeping and stuff. I put myself to bed, you came upstairs, shagged us, then went to bed? No one could blame me whatsoever, it's perfect really. [Moaning] [Music] Everyone's a bit awkward. Vicky and Ricci had a spoon, everyone's a little bit hung over, Charlotte slept with Gary last night. Let's all give a round of applause! Not. Before I used to think, Gary, Gary, Gary, and now I think I'm kinda thinking about what I'm doing. Gary and Charlotte, she literally got the memory of a goldfish, and gets hurt once around a tank and has forgotten about it, and she's back to his penis again. I think there is some underlying issues going on with Charlotte at the minute. I think she aslso know that it's not got a future and it's not possible, and that revelation must be quite hard to deal with, and hard to take. Who here farted when you're cooking breakfast? It was you! It was actually you! It was you! You just shit on the breakfast! [Laughter] Me and Vicks have been together so much, 24/7 in a house, when we're not with each other, we're constantly thinking about each other, if she doesn't want it, then she doesn't want it. Ricci has made the worst move he can ever make, what he's pecked Vicky three or four times, he's like committing' himself to a relationship without any advantages of getting banged or sucked off or spooned or anything. I can't even remember what we were arguing about, somethin that was probably daft, somethin' I've done, probably... and normally I wouldn't give this girl a second chance, but I'm going to bang her. Whoa! Yeah! Yeah! The beach was a little hangover cure, I mean, you're in the house, you're hung over you want to get out, fresh air, best place to go, beach. [Laughter] All the girls are together, it's like old days, but there's a new girl, Becca. Where's she? She's with the boys, shock. Flirtin' away, shock. You know what we call that? A slag. She's over there. Do you know why she's over there? I'm sure he's telling her that Jay doesn't want her? I think that's what it is. So we can jump in his grave? It's not so we can jump in his grave, he couldn't care less, man. She's not fuckin' nice. She's not compared to you. I'll admit it, me and Rebecca actually are just mates. If Gary wants to go for it, fuckin' go for it. Jay got in that, banger's rights, but I can't help myself, if it was me, I would have already banged her. It would've happened the first night. I think Gaz is a really nice lad, but he'd flirt with anything with legs. [mumbled exchange] I'm so fucked up at Gary! I'll be honest, I'm quite jealous! What the fuck do I do! ? [music] I haven't spoke to my boyfriend Dan since Friday. The main reason is because I feel a bit guilty. I either need to tell Ricci to back off, or tell Dan that I'm a bitch. The last thing I want to do when I'm trying to focus on how much I care about me boyfriend, focus on how much this relationship means to us, focus on the fact that I shouldn't be being a bit of a flooze, is that a fancy walker passed me with his fucking top off! [Music] [talking amongst themselves in the background] I think the obvious thing I want to do is, bang a bird. You need to stop the gay rumors, but you need to bring someone home. [laughter] James is being really nice lately, he seems to have lost the bond with the boys and he's always with the girls. Maybe he might be gay. Sensitive side, that's his angle isn't it? With the comb over, and the banter. I was looking in the mirror, I was looking at meself I'm going, what do I do? And I thought, comb over! But everyone loves it, everyone's being their nicest, all the girls are, just wanna be mates. I'm hoping thats a cut when I go out. Spooning mates, but not Holly. I'm going to set this barrier upright so Holly can't spoon us. He's got this like affect on me, because he's like you always want what you can't have, and everybody loves a dick head. So, he's just fucking perfect for that. Why you being a dickhead again? Stop it! Stop the argument! [Music] It's Tuesday, which means it's coo-sday, which means it's party time. Whoa! [Music] I want to dance, flirt, get me goggles on. [Music] The last few nights of being an absolute nightmare, can't find a single decent bird anywhere. Just can't pull. [Music] James' friend, Ben walks in, he's a bit all right actually, finally someone giving' me some attention, unlike James who gives me fucking none. My friend, who is Riley, he's there, and what did I decide to do, a little tash on. [Music] [Music] I'm going in the fuck hut now, and I ain't coming out till I'm done. I'm in me own bed, settled down, all of a sudden, Riley gets in me bed, I've got a boyfriend, and I'm not cheating. I can only make little steps. I get far too merry, and say it's a good idea to spend one on one time with the guy who I'm desperately trying to avoid, because I fancy 'im and I've got a boyfriend. We follow each other around like we're lovesick teenagers. Cheers, mate! Thank you very much. Thank you very much, baby. I'll let you have the little pink one. Awh! He's like tactile and attentive. Well, what's happening between Jay and Rebecca? Obviously Jay would love to bang her. If she goes anywhere near Gary, there will be world war three in our house. Oh no! I'm telling ya, it'll go sky high. And, Charlotte will kick her face in. He loves female company, just the same way as I love male company. Goin' to have a little wiggle. We are bad for one another. Sitting, getting a cuddle, eating a kebob... it doesn't sound romantic but I had butterflies. [Music] Last night was complete carnage; some sort of crazy last minute porn frenzy happened right at the end of the night, so what woke up this morning the place is like a fuckin' brothel, and I'm in bed with Ricci, shock. [Music] it was mental last night! I pulled. I didn't have sex. I got the no sex onezie as proof as well. I'm a good girl. [Music] I woke up with a man in me bed, and it's not me boyfriend, and it looks like I've spooned the fuck out of him. Mine and Sophie's room is on the ground floor, because we've got boyfriends, we don't want to get involved in all the crazy, bed hopping madness of upstairs. Right now, our beds are seeing more action, than the rest of the rooms combined. [Doorbell rings] Is that the doorbell? I'm coming, I'm coming. The doorbell of doom rings. [greeting each other] Oh my God, look at a mess in here. I feel so ashamed. It is typical, every time Sophie's dad comes; Sophie's got a lad in her bed. Sophie? What? How are you my darling? How are you? I'm very good, how are you doing? I'm glad you're okay. What better than distract him, then go to Holly where she is in the fuck hut with a boy. Me dad came to see ya, what? I mean it's not something that parents should see. You just made me look like an absolute slut. [Laughter] This is so disrespectful. Come on! I'm getting up now! Come on, let me see you! Oh my God! Of course he is! He found his princess, little miss innocent, and there was nobody in my bed last night, mmm. See, I'm trying a new angle, I'm trying the approach of being like, yeah James I don't fancy you anymore, you always want what you can't have. Tables may turn. Shock! Holly's got Ben in the fuck hut. Surely this means that she's not going to come and try to bang me. I don't know what the fuck he thinks! Wh - I just don't understand why he doesn't want to pull me, he hasn't had sex for ages. I need a favor, I've got a party coming in half twelve at the restaurant, I've got no staff, yeah I need a couple of you's to come help me out. Obviously I'm hung over right now. And, I can't be all- but this is the best place to work in the world. Please don't let me down, bring a couple of your friends and ahh- What time? Be there for not later than twelve. I've got people coming in at half twelve, and I've got to sort things out. Okay. [Music] I am just like one of them dogs out in the shower, and when you find the owner, and they're all excited and they humping' the owners leg, that's how excited I am about the restaurant. I need Charlotte, Gaz, James in the kitchen. [Music] Please make one more straight away. Have yous got any mussels? Mussels? Yeah! I'll find out for you. Yeah, thank you. It's hard work like, which isn't for me, flirting's not hard work, so I'm just going to enjoy meself. Becca is falling for Jay right now. Welcome to Mambos, is it just a table for two? Yeah, and two guests. And, the little one. Amanda, the bird that I've been seeing, has just come through the door. I'm like fuck, the last person I wanna see walk through this door right now is Amanda, because I do still have feelings for her. She's got her tits pushed up to her chin, she's dark haired, she was nice, but not a patch on me. I'm not being funny, I think she's better looking than Becca right now! Me and Jason were getting quite close till we had to go into work, and this thing, comes and spoils it all, with her big tits. And her fucking whine. I'm going to fuck her food up, just because she's talking to Jason and I don't like it. What can I get you? The chicken but I just don't want the sauce. Not with white wine sauce. What kind of sauce, any? Just I don't want any sauce. Hello? Chef! Ahh, yes. We want a chicken, and white wine. Service! Chicken in a white wine sauce. I don't like white wine sauce. I bet Becca's doing this on purpose just to get her total fuckin' pissed. Chicken without the white wine sauce. I was trying to give him the puppy dog eyes, he's not impressed. But, I knew what I wanted to do, and I did it. It's never a good idea to have two lasses in the same place at one time, but at least Rebecca has just fucked up her food, if that would have been Vicki, she would've swilled her, maybe even spat on her. She's half naked with her tits pushed up her chin, Jason's' got his love goggles on, it's not good, I'm going to take those love goggles off because she doesn't deserve them. They're mine. [Music] All in all, James is a bit, lacking in the pullin' department, so us lasses decided to give him a hand and get some boobs around, and hopefully James will get a shot at the end of the night. [Laughter] [Doorbell rings] Whoa! Hello! I'm thinking, them four girls aren't for me. They just like yeah, really? I am really thankful that the girls went through so much effort in that, but how about next time, just day bellend job with you? I'm from Norwich. Norwich? Down south. I know where it is but. These girls are half of gems but any girls that come into my house, I can't help myself. What do you want to do? This is the fuck hut, it is where you might be with me later. Charley I'm just taking charge of the band of them and just havin' a little fun with them. Yay! [Music] Have a good time, everyone! Cheers! I'm so angry about all these girls coming for James because I know that they're not coming for James! It's going to be Gary, who's pulling them, James boxes it off! [Laughter] [background talking] He's the most annoying person ever when he's had a drink. Do that all night when you could not be fuckin' getting it? [Laughter] I think you're right, but he just pissed himself, nearly a joke that, I would, in no way describes anything more than mediocre. Ricci is fuckin' mortal, he cannot drink to save his life, he is really really irritating us at the minute. Is it all right babe? Good I'm glad you like it. I'm getting hot with my attire on. Gaz is the best thing, instantly thinks Jacuzzi time, get the girls all dresses off. I want to go to anger management classes and share my angry stories with all the other angry people there. Tonight, is the decider, if he goes with someone else tonight, I'm like, that's it. I know all this is going to get me in so much trouble with Charlotte. But, hang on a minute, we ignore each other at the minute. So technically, that means I can do what I want so I'm not doing nothing wrong. Fucking game on. Some bird in my room says excuse me can you put some oil and some coconut butter on me tits. Umm, yes it's me you're talking to! I was like fucking come on! Ahh man. [happy shouting] Let's spy on the situation, and see how much of a sleeze ball Gary really is. I feel a hand on me leg. And this hand like moves up, and this hand goes in me shorts, I was saying hello. Wait wait! She's touching it! Oh my god! It's starting to get a little bit awkward. So, we decide that game over, Charlotte don't watch anymore. Gaz is sitting in the middle of the girls, what a surprise. But, it's not looking good for James. We've done up this big party for James, he still doesn't manage to get laid. That could be me and James in that fuck hut. Charlotte is upset. She goes to bed so down, she is literally at the bottom. I can't do it anymore watching Gary night after night with all other girls, it has to stop. It's not fair that my emotions are constantly getting hurt because of this. [Music] I've woke up this morning, and I need to leave, I need to tell him that it's over. And, that I can't keep doing this anymore, and I need to go. I'm not saying going to start saying that's what needs to stop, and everyone knows that but it's easier said than done. I can't be with Gary anymore. I'm not actually getting over him. It's really starting to mess with me head. I don't want it anymore. For me to see Charlotte leave that house is... it's a massive thing and that I've been through so much with Charlotte, that I would never want her to leave. Bye. I just want to go home and see me mom. And, I'll be back when I'm ready. At this present time, I do think her going home will help her. Gary has woke me up, to the worst news I could ever want ever. I tried to kiss, and she left. Fuck off. I swear on my life. She's left the house, upset because of what's happened to her, because of him. Erm, Charlotte's gone home. Gone away, what? She's actually gone. What? Out of everybody in this house, she's always been the one who enjoyed it the most. And she's gone. And to watch that deteriorate and lose our sparkle and everything I get so upset, so upset enough that she wants to leave. You just don't understand what she must have been going through. It's not going to be the same without her. We're close to Charlotte -- Oh! Us girls is meant to be her best friends, we've massively fucked up. [Music] [Phone rings] Hello. Hi good morning, it's Anna. Hi Anna, its Sophie, you all right? Is Sophie okay? Uh huh. I have a job for you today. Have ya? What? She wants me and Becca to go to work. [inaudible] So if you could get ready right away. Right okay. I have to work with Becca; I don't like her from the start. Vicky is starting to like her, it might be good. We got work to do. I've got to work with Sophie today, which I'm pleased because I don't really know her. It gives us chance to speak to, make a bond, and hopefully build bridges with everyone else. [Music] Shit. Hello. It's two fucking hunks. One of them is really nice, - You can lay the boxes underneath because they are a little bit see-through. However, if you get sprayed, down there, makes everything look bigger. Whoa! I got a boyfriend. I'm really good at flirting, I swish me hair back and forth, I stick me boobs out, everyone loves it. Is that your tense look? I make Cupid look stupid. Spot on! You know what? That girl is actually all right. I'm laughing with her, I'm having a joke with her, she seems all right, and she's making a little bit of effort. I actually really like Sophie she's like cool as a cucumber like me. See ya later. Bye! Bye. [Music] With Charlotte gone, everyone's feeling a little bit deflated, everyone's feeling a little bit down, and at the start of the evenin, none of us feel like going clubbing. I want to have a quick toast before we're out again. All right, that's cool. Just like obviously absent friends, we wish Charlotte comes back soon. Yeah, she'll be back. Ready? Cheers to Charlotte. Tonight I think we should just stay together for her and hope she will be back soon, she can join us on another night out. Couldn't agree more babe. James is looking the same color as the salsa there, aye? She still wouldn't say no though, would ya? James might be looking a bit like a tomato right now, but I mean, he can have my fajita, any day? It's nice to acknowledge Charlotte is gone, but it isn't really not my scene, I just wanted to get out of there as quick as I could. Me and Gary are like two peas in a pod, best thing for us to do is just fuck off and hit have to be with someone who could be a potential husband and a father to my son, and I'm pretty sure that's not your thing. No, I.... -Well, I could do that. -You could? -Sure. -Okay. Bryson, grab your bag. We gotta go. Okay. You're not gonna stalk me now, are you? -Not unless you want me to. -l think I'll take a pass on that. I'm really glad we had this conversation. Cleared everything up. Call me, okay? -Good job out there today. -Bye, thanks, coach. She will not leave me alone. -l'm telling you, she wants me. -Yeah, I could see it all over her face. -Can you? -Yeah. Really? I don't know what I'm gonna do. College boy, what the hell you want? Got a beef with me, let's do it. Don't kill your son's future because of it. What I do with my son, that's my business. I'm making it my business. Knock that victim chip off your shoulder. Or Darius is gonna end up just like you. Your punk ass would know all about that too. When are you gonna stop blaming the world for punching my college ticket? Didn't nobody force you to sling that crack. What I do with my son, it's my son, it's my business. Well, give your son an opportunity. Hey, and the next time you come up here you better come up here strapped. Talking that beef garbage. Carmen, I've been looking for two days for you. For two days, Carmencita. I inquired at the factory, and you were absent. Why do we have to watch this? Can't we watch something else? Girl, shut up, you know we ain't changing this channel. Hello? Yeah, hold on a second. To the magi- - Magistrate. To the magistrate? He'll send me to prison. I can't go to prison. It's just he died in the prison. And I had no money to survive-- Coach, hey, can you come to my swim meet Saturday so I can show you my stuff? It would have to be in the afternoon. We have a game in the morning. Okay, cool, I'll see you at the pool. Give me that phone. I'm so sorry, honestly, and if it's too much pressure-- No, no, look, it's no problem. Tell him I'll be there. Oh, I know. Believe me, I know. -Are you seeing this? -What? Since when he gotta go outside to answer a phone call? I'm not afraid of hard work. I'm a good, honest, working girl. But who would take care of me--? Honey, I spent too many years with your raggedy-ass daddy to know when something's wrong. See this? These movies had romance. Good movies, good writing. I'm ready to go now, soldier. Please take me away from here. -This scares me, David. -What? This. The silence between us. I was thinking, with our anniversary coming up maybe we should just get away for the weekend, you know? Because I know it's been stressful since the accident, I know. It's been a lot longer than that. Okay, that's fair. I've never felt some of the feelings I'm feeling and I just don't know how to deal with them. I guess what scares me the most is you pulling away like this because it's not like you, David. Can we talk to someone about it, please? If that's what you want. Since the accident, I know I've been a little difficult to get along with. I know that. And I've been depressed, you know? And that should be understandable. I'm getting over a major injury. But David's pulling away and I don't know why. l-- l feel like he's doing it on purpose. Like I've done something. Like he's paying me back for something I don't even know I've done. And then he spends all of his time with these boys, this Little League team. And that's time he could be spending with me at home. Working on our marriage. Dave, what do you wanna say to Clarice right now? I mean, what's the point? You heard her. She has everything figured out, so.... You see what I mean? This attitude is-- lt makes my skin crawl because that's not us, bishop. We used to talk things through. We talked about everything-- No, no, we never used to talk about everything, okay? You used to do all the talking. I used to sit, listen to her and her mother cackle. Cac- - He has no respect for my mother. -Let's just-- -Mama loves you. No, no, she doesn't love me, she tolerates me. Because she loves you. But I'm cool with that. -Can't believe you just sit up in this-- -Dave, Clarice. Why do you say that, Dave? Well, the truth of the matter, bishop is that I feel like I'm just visiting this marriage. See? See? I mean, nothing I ever do, nothing I ever say is ever enough. -Oh, God. -That's honest. -Please, that's David being dramatic. -Clarice. -You should get an award for that one. -Clarice. What irks you about Dave coaching those Little Leaguers? He's never home, bishop. You know? He's always with them. He's always with those boys. That's all he cares about. You mean like what a father would like to do if he had a son? Maybe. -But he knows we can't afford children. -No, we can afford kids, okay? If someone didn't live beyond their means, we could afford kids. Please, David. Look at us, look at us. Trying to fix our marriage. Do you really think a baby is gonna help? -l used to. -That's enough. Are you finished? Do the two of you remember how I told you on your wedding day how hard life can be? Well, that three-stranded cord I wrapped around your shoulders that day, will always be there. Unless, of course, you've chosen to remove it. Does that feel good? Dave. Are you okay? You were moaning. Yeah, I was.... l'm gonna get a drink of water. I guess that makes it ours. -Yes. -Oh, I love it, Clarice. And you managed to keep it alive while we made up our minds. Well, actually it was Michelle here who kept it alive and that's why she's gonna share in the commission. -Well, thank you. -Okay. -l've got to get to the courthouse. -No, you don't. You first have to see new tile samples for the master bathroom. I got a full caseload. Court won't wait for me. The tile samples. Yes. Yes. Okay, Clarice, what's wrong? We just closed one of the biggest deals of your life and you walking around like somebody stole your bike. -What's going on? -Nothing. -l'm fine. -Nothing, yes, it is. Tell me, come on now. This is me, tell it. It's-- l'm just having one of those days, okay? Just.... Do not make me go Oprah on you, because I will. I think David's having an affair. -What? -Yes. Oh, honey, are you sure? Yes, Michelle. I can see it in his eyes. It's always in the eyes, ain't it? And it's my physical therapist. What? That skinny little white thing? -lt's Julie Sawyer. -Okay. Oh, girl. What? You got to go over there and open up a good old can of soul-sister power on her narrow behind. I can't do that. I don't have any real proof. We got to go over there and snatch her. Michelle, I can't do that. Snatch her by her hair and squeeze until that heifer tell us everything we wanna know, okay? You want me to do it? Look at me, look at me. Don't go all Waiting to Exhale on me. Dave is too good a man for you to lose. And you don't want to do something all crazy that you can't take back. Now, you take that from me. I know. Don't tell me Todd is cheating too. I did the cheating. -What? -l know. Don't look at me like that, I know. How--? How was he able to forgive you? It was not easy, okay? It took a long time. But he forgave me, after all that. And I will never sacrifice his heart like that again. Yeah, well, that's good for you guys but I just don't think I have it in me to do that. Yes, you do. Now, are you sure you don't want me to go snatch the white girl? Why are you so crazy? I'm just saying. It'll make you feel better. -No, it'll make you feel better. -Yes, yes, it will make me feel better. Oh, my friend. -l am so sorry. -Me too. Maybe we should snatch Dave too. Just do a drive-by snatching, and snatch everybody. You can do it. -lt's all right. -Way to go for it. Good job, Bryson. Let me tell you something, Bryson. You were a beast up in that pool. -Thanks, coach. -l can't wait to come to another meet. Well, I'm here all weekend if I keep winning. The finals are tomorrow. Hey, Bryson, wait up. There is a rep here from the Junior Olympics. And I want you to meet him. -Are you serious? -You're on your way, young man. Okay, well, go. We'll be out here waiting for you. Okay. Hey, listen, thank you so much for taking the time to come out here today and-- l mean, it really means the world to both of us. Hey, a deal's a deal, right? Hey, Dave? Don't take this the wrong way or anything but we single girls are experts at a few things. -Like what? -Like good men. I was telling Clarice just the other day about how all the guys like you are already taken and that she's a very lucky woman. Thanks. Can I ask you a question? I saw your college photo at the house. What happened to your baseball career? Anterior cruciate ligament happened to my career. -Oh, man. -Yeah. I was sliding into home plate. My knee went one way and my body went the other. Along with my dreams of making it into the big leagues. Well, at least you're passing those dreams on to those Little Leaguers. Yeah, somebody's got to take care of them. -And that you do. -That I do. And who takes care of you? Hello, hello. -Hey. -Hey. -What are you doing here? -l can ask you the same question. I was just bringing flowers. I never brought flowers before in my entire life, just so you know. And they aren't for you, my married friend. Yeah, well, I didn't think so. Okay, I think I'm gonna go check on the boys inside. Oh, they're beautiful. Hey, these flowers don't mean I'm stalking you. No, they're beautiful. Yeah. -We had a conversation. -Okey-doke. Okay, that's weird. Clearly I don't have a chance with this girl, which is deeply baffling to me. So seriously, man. -What are you doing here? -What am I doing here? You don't think I see what's going on here? You got everything a man could want. A gorgeous wife, beautiful home. And you think that that makes it all good for me? I just don't want to see you screw up your life. Too late for that. My life's already screwed up. Dave. Who takes care of me? -Hey, Dave. -That's a damn good question. A question I didn't have an answer for. Hi. You didn't notice the candles? -Reesie, l-- -Come on, baby. You remember the candles. When we first got married, they were always my signal to let you know I was gonna put something on you. I know. I know it's been a long time since I lit my candles for you, I.... You don't have to do this. Baby, we need this. I sent Mama on a long errand, so she won't be back for a long time. Come here, please. Like you said, it's time for us to get back to the loving part of our marriage. -Oh, baby, I want you so bad. -Stop. -Are you sleeping with her? -What? I'm not stupid, David. -Are you sleeping with Julie? -No, I'm not sleeping with her. Well, then, what is it? What--? Since when have you had to take phone calls outside? What are all the phone calls about, anyway? David, what's happening? Tell me the truth. Things haven't been right between us and I think we both know that. I know that. So I'm not gonna lie to you. I do have some feelings for her. That's worse. She's taken your heart from me? So, what do you want me to do? I don't know, David. -Clarice. -How could you, Julie? -What? -How could you betray me like this? -Betray you, what--? -l respected you. I thought we were friends. Okay, I gotta stop you right there if this is what I think it's about. Dave and I are friends. Just like you and I are friends. Nothing more, nothing less. We're just friends. Girl, as much as I would like to snatch you right now I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna rise above this. But let me make myself very clear. Stay the hell away from my husband. You wanna blame someone for your problems? You didn't need to leave your doorstep to do it. And you certainly don't need to come to mine. Oh, girl. In case you didn't hear me the first time stay away from my man. Yeah. -Yeah, come on. -Here we go. Take your marks. -Come on. -Kick, kick, kick. Go, Bryson! Come on, Bryson! Keep pushing! -Come on, Bryson! -Go! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, he's done it! Oh, my God! Why don't we say it's a draw? Let me ask you this, man to man. Ain't nobody in here but me and you. Who gets that baseball scholarship if we back in the day? You do. But I was a better athlete. Right. So you think all the hell I've been through was my fault. Man, everybody got problems. See, you just don't know how good you got it. You talking about Darius, right? I'd trade that scholarship and everything I had for a son like Darius. Oh, hell, no. Yeah, that's right. That's right. We putting you out of here. And don't think Clarice is gonna change her mind. What you doing, you old woman? -Old? Oh, no, hell, no. -Mama, please! No, no, no, let her talk. She's always had an equal vote. Why change it now? What is wrong with you? You got this beautiful black queen right here. What in your mind makes you think you gotta go out and get a white woman? Shut up and mind your own business. -David. -No. He been living high on the hog leeching off your money for years. It's time you got his black ass out of here. She more of a man than you'll ever be. So you just gonna stand there and let her say that to me? Clarice. You are just gonna stand there and let her say that to me? Well, then you're right. It is time for me to get out of here. Because I don't give a damn about this house your money or this marriage. I'm done. Dave. Hey, where you been? I've been trying to call your cell. There was an accident. -lt's Bryson. -What happened? I don't know, he went into the wall too hard. They rushed him to the hospital. It's bad, man, really bad. Come on, I'll drive. -l should go. -You ain't going nowhere. Go on in the house. Coach. Please, what are you doing? No, no, no. Please, no. No, no. Oh, please, God. She's all alone. I don't think she has anyone to help her through this. She has us. "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil." "My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Amen. Clarice, be honest with me. In the last meeting I had with you and Dave I asked you a very important question. Yeah. Has God been the third strand in that cord I wrapped around your shoulders all those years ago? No. Well, without that third strand you find yourself sitting here alone. Your mother is a good woman. But because you listened to her in matters of your marriage that acorn hasn't fallen too far from the tree. Now, I got to go bury this child. But, Clarice you're in the right place at the right time. When I drive through this city and hear the sounds of sirens and alarms going off I see the looks of panic on the faces of people I don't know. I realize how afraid we all are in this world. Life is so unpredictable, fragile. We're only alive one breath, one heartbeat at a time. And so when death comes to one of us it comes to all of us. Because it's the one thing we all have in common. Sooner or later, it's the one place we're all headed. And even though some of us believe that life doesn't end on this side of the grave our grief drives us to hunger for a human touch. Mama, what's that? is that a picture of Daddy? Let me see that. Give it here. -So you still love him? -No. That's a piece of him I keep as a reminder that I made the right decision. Do you miss him at all? Do you remember that cheerleading competition I won? I remember all your accomplishments, Clarice. What you want? That was the same weekend Daddy left. But all I remember you saying-- Don't start dredging up all that mess. That's good riddance to bad rubbish. All I remember you ever saying to me was how he cheated on you and how he was a horrible husband. Never really got his side. Finally talked to Daddy, and he said that he never slept with that woman. He said you drove him out of the house, Mama. He didn't sleep with her until after- l'm not having this conversation. -Why? Because my bedroom drama with your daddy ain't none of your business. Excuse me? The way you're all up in my marriage? You convinced me to put my husband out of my house. I think it is my business, Mama. Don't talk to me like that. Okay, all right. You wanna know? Yes. Your daddy was rotten. You were too young to understand what was going on in that house. He was a nasty bastard. -Mama-- -Don't "Mama" me. He hit me in my face. Now, you listen to me real good. When they stay, and they done already left they get mean. I hated your daddy. -Mama. -No, I hated him. I hated him! You were right to throw Dave's ass out of here before he hits you. No. No, David's not like that. And that wasn't the way to handle that. I shouldn't have listened to you. I shouldn't have listened to you. I'm not gonna talk about this. I'm not. Black women have to be strong and you know that. I don't know what kind of pain you are holding on to in your heart, Mama but you need to let it go. You need to just let it go. And in all your lessons about how I need to be strong and proud and independent, Mama you left out some very important things. -What? -How to love, Mama. How to really care about somebody. How to forgive. I cared about you. I loved you the best I could. I gave you everything in me that he didn't take. And he took everything. Can't you see that? I know you did, Mama. And if that ain't good enough for you, then I'm sorry for you. No. Mama, I'm so sorry for you. I didn't mean to come out here and disrespect you, I really didn't. But it's time for me to grow up and I'm gonna have to ask you to leave my house because I want my husband. I want my husband back, and I want to fight for my marriage. Because, Mama, I don't want to end up like you. I don't. I'm gonna pray for you, Mama. I love you so much. Little girl. You pray for yourself. I'll be gone when you get back. Go on. Okay. Okay. I'm not sorry about what we did. I love you. -Please leave. -Not until we talk. We can't. If Shawn comes up here and.... -He can never find out about this. -He won't. Then why are you even doing this? Hey, hey! Hey, come on, Dave, knock. -You scared me. -What are you doing here? What do you mean? Why didn't you knock? I just came by. Talked to the manager. I told him I was your probation officer, he let me up. -So, what are you doing here? -l can't come by to see my friend? I know what you're going through. I wanna make sure that everything that you are going through is cool. -Make sure you're copasetic. -What are you watching? Just something to make me feel better. I had-- Vanessa kicked your ass out, didn't she? First of all, that's just crazy to even think that she would kick me out. Okay, why would she kick her husband out? Her husband, the man she's supposed to love. Can I tell you what she said to me? Can I tell you what she said? -Listen, look at me. -What did she say? She told me I'm too emotional. I'm way too in touch with my feminine side. No man should apologize to nobody that much. My feet, she don't like my feet now. All of a sudden my feet is a problem? But her back, I can accept that? -You can't accept my feet? -Here's what I want you to do. Go back home to your wife. No, I'm gonna make her think I'm cheating. You need to go back home to your wife. -Why don't you--? -Go back home to your wife. Can you talk to me? Listen, can you talk to me for two seconds? Why can't me and you get in touch, figure out why this keep happening? -l'm emotional now. -Good men. -Good brothers. -Emotional, here we go. We're good black men. -Got my toiletry bag? -Here you go. -Because I don't want to-- -Here we go. I love you, I don't tell you enough. -Here we go. -All right, you right. -Thank you, Dave. -Have a good night. Do you got my toiletry bag? Okay. Hello. Thank you for coming. And thank you for taking care of everything. l-- l couldn't have done it. Are you okay? I think he was so focused on winning and that medal, he.... His coach told him about-- Why didn't I remind him? "You have to take the trash out when we get home." What? That's the last thing I said to him. Before the race. "You have to take the trash out when we get home." Not "l love you." Not "l'm so proud of you." Not "l'm so lucky to be your mom." "You've got to take the trash out when we get home." -lt's okay. -No, it is not gonna be okay. It's-- lt's never gonna be okay. Oh, my God. lt's just not gonna be. -lt's all right. -You can't make it better. Just stop. It's not. lt never is. Wait, no, wait. I can't do this. I know. I'm sorry. I know. Now, you tell the crew for me there are four ways of doing things onboard my ship: The right way, the wrong way, the Navy way, and my way. If they do things my way, we'll get along. -Aye, aye, sir. -Okay. Oh, the manager gave me a key. -l can leave if you-- -No, no, no, it's cool. That manager would give a key to anybody. David, I just need you to let me say some things, okay? I have been round and round with my heart and I want you to know two things. First of all, Mama has lost all of her voting privileges in this marriage. And, second no one ever taught me how to be one of those wives who holds on to her man's every word. And no one taught me how to trust him to take care of me, you know? I really don't know if I could ever be that woman but I do want to learn how to be your partner. And whatever you decide I need you to know that I can't live without you, David. I don't want to live without you and I love you so much. Come here. What's that? I heated you up a plate because you're staying in a roach motel and I wanted you to eat. -l cooked it. -You cooked it? -Yes. -There ain't poison in this, is there? You're not gonna eat it? You're not gonna eat the food? Hi. What up? What up? You know, I was hoping, man I can get Darius back on your team, you know? It's like you, you know-- You helping him to be a better man. Why don't we both do that? Darius, where you at? Okay. Listen, I got you back on the team, man. Yeah, and I got you a new glove. So I want you to come back home and be there by, like, 5:00. And.... l love you, man. You know? Yeah. All right. I found out that if you wanna know the purpose of a thing you can't ask the thing to tell you. A car doesn't know why it's a car. Only the manufacturer knows what it was made to do. And I guess that's the way it is with us and God. You know you'd make an excellent daddy someday. Well, I hope so. What about in, like, seven and a half months? Are you saying that...? God didn't just make Dave Johnson to be a husband or a coach, a friend, or a daddy. Those are just roles, not who I am as a man. But I guess, sometimes he has to let life turn you upside-down so you can learn how to live right side up. Finally. Thank you. You're welcome. - no good? - larry! it tastes like you put the whole salt shaker up in here. No, that's way too salty. way too salty. All right, it's too salty. i'm sorry. Pfft, could you make it any hotter in here, by the way? - it feels good. - it feels good? - Yeah, it feels good. 75° is perfect. I can't even sleep in this room at night, it's so hot. honest to god. - what temperature would you prefer? - 68°. - 68°? ! See, that's some white-people shit right there, l.d. Black people like it a little bit warmer at night, okay? - at least compromise. - no no no, 75° works for me, l.d. I'll call leon. let's see what he says. leon! - leon, come in here! - he gonna let you know that that's how we like it. Okay, you know, i can't sleep. it's too hot at night. I want to sleep in 68° temperature. She wants to sleep in 75°. let's compromise at 72°. Oh no, fuck that, larry. you my motherfucking man, larry, but 72°? shit. You might as well sleep outside. i'm an 82° man myself. - see there, i told you! - 82°, that's my shit. that's my fucking region. - you really wanted it 68°. - 6-fucking-8? he said 68°? - get the fuck outta here. - it's like a frigerator. - oh my goodness. - you take that shit? - you bring a honey to the hotel and shit get up in that motherfucker. it's all cold and shit-- got to heat her ass up. All right now, you make sure you do your homework before you watch that tv. - hey, hi! - hey, larry. - hey, i got some shows tivo'd. don't erase them. They erase all my tivo'd shows. You know what, larry? there's been another robbery in this neighborhood. I was just talking to the neighbors. it's the third one this month. What are you talking to the neighbors for? They came over and let me know what's going on. You don't need to talk to the neighbors, okay? Yeah, but, larry, there's been a robbery. I'd rather have the thieves than the neighbors-- thieves don't impose. what are you talking about? the neighbors want your time. The thieves want your things. i'd rather give them things than time. Listen, have you heard anything from the doctor about loretta's biopsy? No no, they said a couple of days. Oh. you know, at first i was really worried, larry. But no matter what the outcome is, loretta has you by her side. You know, things could get bad, larry, but she's got you to hold her hand. And if she has to do chemo and it causes her to lose her hair, Throw up and all that, you gonna be right there by her side. Thank you, larry. 75°? i'm baking in that room at night. It's like i'm cinderella in there, i swear to you. cinderella? what do you mean? cinderella, you never saw the fairy tale cinderella? No no, i know cinderella. but what aspect of cinderella? what do you mean? - what aspect do you think i mean? - i don't know. the shoe? - she gets bossed around by the stepmother! - i'm comparing me-- - don't get mad at me! - don't get mad at me. - well, you're so stupid! - don't get mad at me. So that's what it's like, huh? that's terrible. That's what it's like. exactly. - that's what it's like. - oh, that's horrible. - you know what? you know what the worst part is? - what? we're waiting for the results. I got about 24 hours to get out of this thing before the results come back. Yeah, you can't break up with somebody who's got cancer. you gotta break up with her before she gets those test results. god, it's gonna be so hard. - why? what's the big deal? - what do you mean "what's the big deal?" The whole family's gotta move out-- it's a big deal! I'd much rather be in her position than mine any day of the week. No, to be the breaker-upper you're in control. Couples should have like a pre-breakup agreement Before they start going out because every relationship is going to end at some point. All you do is send a text. you make an agreement-- "if you see the word 'apricot,' it means it's over." Okay, hypothetically, what if you or she are eating apricots at that point? Can I tell you something about apricots? You know, one in 30 is a good one. It's such a low-percentage fruit. Always a mealy dry... Hey, how's it going? - Hi, Lar. - Oh, hey. Want to come to a dinner party tonight? - Tonight? - Yeah. You know you love my cooking. It's a little late for an invitation, is it not? - Well... it's an invitation nonetheless. - Who else is gonna be there? - Uh, eh, you don't need to know. - Why not? - Because it's not done, that's why not. - What do you mean it's not done? It's a social convention that people don't ask who's going to be there at the dinner party. It's just not done. - Big deal. Why isn't it done? - Because it isn't! I don't know the derivation of the convention. Why are you following it blindly like this? You should be glad that it happens that way, because if I told people you were coming, they might not show up. That's probably why people don't tell... Because if it gets out who's coming nobody would want to go. So why even have it in the first place if people don't want to be with each other? I don't think that's why. It's just not done. What's the downside of telling me? I don't know that there is a downside, except that... - You don't need to know. - Who's coming? - Don't you dare tell him. - What's that? - Who's coming? - I don't know. Why do you even get started with her on this stuff? That's my question. - What time? - 7:30. You've got something to do. You'd better go do it. Not now, maybe tonight. - Thank you. See you later. - Can't wait to see ya! - You take care of yourself, all right? - Thank you, doctor. You're welcome. We still don't know anything. Oh shoot! I forgot... I gotta feed those fish again. It's like a huge responsibility... Feeding fish. It's not fun. Think about it, you know? I'm outside, i gotta go home and feed fish? I mean, seriously, who gives a shit? Mr. david, i wanted to talk to you about your girlfriend. You know, they're not pets, really. But yet it's the same responsibility as a pet. But you get nothing back. you watch them. Is that supposed to be fascinating? I don't know. - can i talk to you about loretta? - what do you think? do you think she has-- Think she has cancer? I-- i can't speculate about that right now. We did a biopsy at the hospital and-- Let me ask you a question: Say you had to make a bet with vegas on this, Would you bet for cancer or against cancer? I-- i-- i don't get into that numbers game. - You must have an idea. - I don't. - No idea? - No idea. What is this thing? I've had this a while. What is that? It's just a skin tag. Just put a little lotion on there. But... Hold on a sec. I'm gonna write you a few prescriptions to fill out. I'm gonna prescribe zithromax and tylenol with codeine. Now the tylenol, that's just as needed for pain. Again, in a few days... any day, we'll have the biopsy back and that will help us determine what the next step is. But right now, I want you to just stay calm, and... What's wrong? You just go into the refrigerator without asking? I just got myself a lemonade. Is that a... I was just surprised you didn't ask. I'm surprised you didn't offer, to be honest. - Well, I was about to offer. - I don't think you we about to offer... Well, I was gonna offer... It is a little unusual to go into someone's refrigerator without asking, is it not? I can tell when somebody's gonna offer me lemonade. You were not going to offer me lemonade. If anything, you were going to complain to me about being a fish owner or something. It is difficult to be a fish owner. Why is that a priority? ! Your girlfriend is sick. I didn't say it's a priority. I just said that they need to be fed and it's something that I need to think about. You do not need to think about that. What you need to think about is the sick woman upstairs. I'm thinking about that. And by the way, why couldn't you ask? Are you so dainty you can't say "May I please have a glass of water?" "May I have a piece of pie?" It could be tuna fish... It doesn't matter. - No, it does matter. - Here, you want? Take... Take this. You don't offer... a hot day... a mover comes here... .. you say, "you want some tuna fish?" - You want this little pear? - Don't condescend to me with your tiny pear. I'm not the one that has a problem here. You are, my friend. - You are. - Yeah. - okay, fine. - yeah, fine. - hey, dr. schaffer. - hello. - Did you see that? Did you see that guy? - What was that whole thing? He goes in my refrigerator. Come on, you don't do that. - what did he take? - lemonade. liquids are okay. I don't believe that people should go into my refrigerator. - what kind of a stupid rule this that? - what do you mean? I don't go into other people's refrigerators. - You could go into my refrigerator. - I don't go into your refrigerator. you're a welcome guest. Hey, how's your sister, by the way? - bam bam? - yeah. Thanks for asking. she's doing a lot better. Yeah. i'm really glad we took her out of that mental institution - that's good. - yeah, i'm excited. You know, if there's anything i can do-- You let me know. You know what? there is something you can do. - what? - yeah you can come over today at 1:00 and visit with her. - visit her? what, are you kidding? - yeah. - why, you didn't mean it? - of course not! - Why did you say it then? - You know, it was some-- an empty gesture. it was something to say. guess what: You said it. be there at 1:00. But one thing-- when you go in the house, Look at her shoes before she calls your name. Don't look at her in the eyes. She'd love to see you. Oh, christ. I don't know how you take a statement like that seriously. But you said it and you're gonna stick to it. - and make her feel good! - all right. I'll see you at jeff's tonight. What's at jeff's? Oh, he's, um, having a little.. Dinner party. I guess i wasn't invited. I can't believe that. Why don't you make sure before you ask somebody... "Am i gonna see you tonight?" - that they were invited? - i just assumed you were going. don't assume anything. if they had told me Who was coming to the party, i would have known - and i wouldn't have asked, but they refused to tell me. - it's not your job To find out who's going to a party. All i want you to do is entertain my sister for two hours And then you can goto your godd. - she better not be dangerous. - be there at 1:00, okay? I gotta sit in a room with that nut? - you look good. - you do. Thank you. Thank you, jeff. And i appreciate the effort, larry. - no effort. - no, it was effortless. Okay, then we're all happy. So what's new? So what's happening? Guess who told marty to shut up. why, what did he say? - i give up. - who? - He didn't tell you? - No, no. She's great-- a great actress. - angelina jolie? - no! You know who i mean. she's an actress. She said shut up right to marty. - nicole kidman? - no! - julia roberts? - no! She's a multi-- multi-talented. Oh, i know, i know! hannah montana. no, you're not even trying! - the kardashians! - what? no! you know who it is! - do you have any idea? - no. Yeah, you do. - Got anything to eat? - No. - anything to drink? - nope. - nothing to eat or drink? - nope. i'm sorry, nothing. - boy, that's interesting. - I know. really. - isn't it? - It is. - i'm gonna go to the bathroom. - I was gonna go to the bathroom. - I just said i'm going to the bathroom. - but i'm saying, could i go first? - no no, i'm going first. - so when you come back, i'm gonna go. - Yes. - Okay. You had sex with a mental patient! - she's not a mental patient. - she's a mental patient. - she's living at funkhouser's. - she's a mental patient. If i went over to the institution and fucked her, then she's a mental patient. What happened? i got up to go to the bathroom. I was sitting there and she said, "i'm bored." I said, "if there's anything i can do"- you said that? - that's it. - an empty gesture? - an empty gesture. - that's how this whole thing started. - that's how it started and then i'm off banging her. You can't make an empty gesture to a funkhouser. They take you up on it. How come you don't have a doorbell? You know what you did? - you totally fucked me. - what? - you fucked me. - what are you talking about? what'd you tell funkhouser about the party for? - Pfft, oh, why? he said something? - Yeah, he said something. he called to complain he wasn't invited and susie invited him. oh, that is so lame! you know that? that is so lame to call up and do that. and guess what else they did? They brought bam bam. bam bam's here! he brought that fucking nutbag into my house! oh my god. what the fuck did you go and tell him for? If you had told me who was coming to the party in the first place, I never would have said anything to him because i would have known he wasn't coming. It's crazy-- all these party rules: you can't tell who you're inviting, You can't tell anybody you're going And you can't talk about it after. It's like living in east germany or something. Now i'm screwed. just look at this. this is crazy. - what is that? is that dr. schaffer? what's he doing here? He had a party recently. he invited us. we're returning the favor. what's the big deal? - Again. - again what? if i had known that he was gonna be here, i wouldn't have come. if i had known bam bam was gonna be here, I would have left town! - who's that guy with the doctor? - that's his boyfriend. - what, seriously? - yeah, he's gay. - oh my god, i didn't know that. - yeah, listen, i gotta go help susie. - hey, how you doing? hi, mr. david, how are you? - this is sam. - hi. it's good to meet you. i didn't know you were gay. Uh, yeah. - is that a surprise to you? - Yeah, i'm a little surprised, yeah. Why? i don't know. i just didn't think you were gay. - what is that supposed to mean? - It doesn't mean anything. it means i was surprised to discover that he's gay. but why? how would i seem if i was gay? what is seeming gay? you seem slightly gay and you don't. so i wouldn't be surprised if somebody told me-- but i'm surprised that somebody tells me you're gay. - is that a crime? - no, it's not a crime. it's just odd. it's not a crime. and it's a little bit offensive. i'm sorry if you're offended. i don't accept your apology 'cause i don't believe that you are sorry. How about if i said i'm pleasantly surprised? - You're living in another decade, mr. david. - i don't think i am. - well, i think you are. - all right, fine. fine, we disagree. - okay, we'll agree to disagree. - All right, great. Unbelievable. What did you do with bam bam? - What? nothing. what do you mean? - When you came over to the house. - i didn't do anything. - It's like a miracle. I've never seen her spirits like this. I mean, the medicine and your visit-- she's a different person. That is fantastic! What great news. I... You shouldn't be giving me any of the credit. This is the man... Come here, come here. - What? - He says Bam Bam is... - ...is like a new person. - How about that? That's great. - Were you there too? - Yeah. No wonder she was singing "I love the fat boy." - I couldn't figure it out. - I love the fat boy. It's great. I can't thank you guys enough! - What did you do? - We just sat and talked with her. - Did you play any games? - No games, uh-huh. - Did you play a million pick-up sticks? - No. The key to the whole thing? You treat them normal and they really respond. I love both of you and you gotta promise me you'll do it again. - If we have time. - It's possible. Oh no, you gotta promise. - We'll see. - Just say you'll go over there. Dinner is served! - Let's go have some dinner. - Thank you so much! Susie, these ingredients are very fresh and well prepared. Oh, thank you, Bam Bam. That's so sweet of you. I'm so glad you were able to join us. I'm so glad you still have food in your fridge considering Larry's around. What is that? What do you mean? Larry likes to clean out fridges like he did today at Marty's house. You were into our fridge uninvited, right? That's ridiculous. Oh? Then might you explain the whereabouts of the freshly-sliced deli-packaged turkey... I don't even eat turkey. ...the yellow mustard in a glass jar. And the lemonade soda? Oh, lemonade? So you're a hypocrite too? Because I had lemonade at your house and you threw... a shit fit. She's emotionally unstable. Are you gonna believe a word this woman says? You know, I don't mind if you take liquid, but when you take regular food, - I have a problem. - I didn't take anything! That's crazy. Speak the truth. Help him with the truth, would you, Jeff? I wouldn't know. I actually wasn't there in the kitchen. You were... You were... Oh no, you weren't. I know where you were! - You were in bed with me. - What? What did you say? What the fuck is she talking about Jeff? What the hell did you do? - Oh, I did nothing. - He didn't do anything. Did you take advantage of this poor deranged girl? You are sick! That's disgusting. What did you do now? You sick fucking pervert. You're... You're serving nothing but lies here. I'm not hungry. What did you do to her, Jeffrey? - How could you do that? - She's fucking nuts! She's a nutbag! - She's a nutbag. I did not do anything. - He's gonna sleep with a mental patient? All right, all right, all right! I believe you! Even Bam Bam is not crazy enough to sleep with you, okay? Only I am. There you go. That's exactly... That's exactly right. Of course. Okay, everybody, everybody, I want to apologize for the Funkhouser family. Oh, stop. It's not necessary. I'm going to have to take her back to the institution. I'm gonna tell you something: I think it would be good for her. And you're doing it for her own safety, for her own good. - No, I'm not so certain. - No, it's good. It's a great thing, because you've gotta think of the long haul. Let's enjoy our dinner. I'm sorry this happened. - The best salad anybody ever made. - Thank you, sweetheart. Hello? What? Hold on, hey, what? Oh, okay. All right, I'll go pick it up. No, I'll leave right now. - You're leaving? - I'm so sorry. I have to go. I have to pick up Loretta's medication. - You didn't give it to her yet? - No, I've gotta get it from the pharmacy. You're leaving, I haven't served the entree yet. It's sad because I'm having so much fun here, and then... and I gotta go and... - Maybe I'll come back. - No, don't bother coming back. Go go go! I got the prescription, Auntie Rae. I'm just gonna get some food to go. - Could you do me a favor? - What? Could you go... up to Loretta and ask her what the name of that restaurant was - we ate in in Santa Monica a few weeks ago? - No. - Why not? - Because she's resting. - Is she sleeping? - No. - Can she talk? - Yes. So let her talk. No. I don't want her talking. I want her resting. Resting? What does resting even mean? She's not sleeping, is she? You can talk and rest. Larry, I am not gonna bother Loretta with this bullshit. Do you hear me? She resting. Bye. Oh, hi, Mr. David. Nice to see you. I'd like some food to go. Oh, I just sat your party. - Party? - Yeah, you had a reservation. I have a reservation? Let me see. "Larry David, 2." My God. Thank you. Well well. Hi, hello. Larry. My man. How's it going, brother? - Pretty good. - Give me some. All right. What, are you using my name to get a table in here? Well, it's so crowded. I just thought you'd... - ...have a better chance. - really? You want to join us? - You could eat with us. - Are you sure? Really? - Please. Sit down. - I miss you. You sure? - Great. - Oh, by the way, I put you up for an N.A.A.C.P. image award. Yeah? Fingers crossed, baby. I think you'll win. - Oh, thank you. - How is Loretta? Oh, she's... she's... yeah. Yeah? Yeah, she's good. How's the no-fly underwear guy? Um, it's not happening. It didn't work out. - Really? - Yeah. Maybe Larry's people can hook you up with somebody. You know Lil Wayne? You know Lil Wayne. Oh, like this. Yeah. I can't... I can't read my... menu. - It's so dark in here. - It's so dark. I honestly have... This is insane. How do they expect people to read this menu? I've got a candle here and I can't read it. I'm gonna go outside. Oh yeah, I'm gonna go outside. I'll go out with you. Larry, what you putting on your hair? I like that. Posner. You learning, Larry. Hang in there, baby. Oh, look, the Caesar salad. - Caesar salad. - You used to get that. That's very good here. - Right. With the 200 croutons. - A lot of croutons. - There were a lot of croutons. - Ton of croutons. I can't believe I'm sitting here with you. - It's weird. - It's crazy. Isn't it? I really miss you. I miss you too. - You do? - Well... kind of. I mean, I do, I do. It's just what was happening was not working for me. It just wasn't... I don't know. It got to this place where you were always at the house and you didn't have anything to do and you... it was just different. Like when you were working on "Seinfeld," You had a job and you'd get up and you'd go, like, do something with other people. And then you'd come home And it was like that was the right amount of Larry. I understand. Too much Larry, I get that. We can reduce Larry in half. We can reduce Larry to a third. We can reduce Larry to three hours a day. That's... - Slivers of Larry is better. - I get that. I've got 24-hour Larry, you think I like it? - Hello? - Larry, Dr. Schaffer just called. He's on his way over to the house right now. He's got the results of the biopsy. He's coming over to the house right now? I'm on my way! - Is everything okay? - Uh, yeah. I gotta go. - Is it an emergency? - Yeah, I gotta go. I'll talk to you. I gotta go get out of something. Shit, damn it! Come on, schmohawk. Larry! - Oh my God. - What took you so long? Never mind. Apology accepted. Now call Marty. - Bam bam... - Call Marty. - I'll go in the house... Just tell me, you lied, right? You lied, Jeff enjoyed. Dirty God... Don't look at them, Larry. Don't get eye contact. Go! Go! Go! - Nice! - Oh my God. - Oh my God. - Only call Marty. - What? Yeah, I am. - Call Marty. - I gotta get in there, bam bam. - No... Ow! Call him. Get your cell out. Bammer, what are you doing here? Tell him Jeff said I was in the top 10! - Tell him. - Stop it. Calm down. Tell Marty Jeff enjoyed me. You should not have left the house. Folks, we had a report of a break-in. Did you see anything? Okay, she'll give you a statement. I've gotta get in the house. I'll take your statement now. No, she can't give you a statement. She's not qualified to make a statement. - She's crazy. - What? ! No, she's not crazy. Yeah, after what she said at dinner tonight, she's crazy. - Oh no no, she... - I'm taking her back to the home. I'm taking her back. If she can't give one, I'll need a statement from you. Have a good night. Sir, did you see a vehicle? Was it individuals What happened? What exactly did you see? Sir, your attention here, sir, if you would, please. All right, well, I saw a guy jump over a hedge across the street. He had a... Oh, the doctor's coming. Larry. Folks, I wish that I had better news for you. The biopsy came back positive for cancer. Now... - Oh, Larry, Larry! - Are you with me? Come on, Larry, come on. Okay, all right. I know this can be very upsetting. - Dr. Schaffer, can I go in and see her? - Yes. It's gonna be okay. Now... This is really where the hard work starts. She's gonna need a lot of help. There's a lot of vitamins, a lot of medicines that she's gonna need. Organic juices three times a day. I would keep the house warmer. Keep it at about 78° to 82° minimum. The warmer the better, really. That helps with the healing process. I know this is a lot to take in, but if you guys work hard, especially you, in two, three, maybe four years, she's hopefully gonna be fine. - Did you say four years? - Could be, yeah. And your life is mostly going to be taking her to appointments or here with her in the house. I... I can still play golf. Absolutely not. I don't imagine you'd have time for that. Once a week? No times a week. You won't have time for that. - What? Nine holes. - Zero holes, Mr. David! This is serious. Now I won't lie... things are going to get ugly. There's going to be vomiting. There's going to be incontinence, depression, unsightly hair loss, weight loss. She'll be irritable. Lots of massive mood swings. She could get violent. hysteria, incontinence... Have I already said that? THE EYE OF THE STORM Hi, my name is Kim Reeshaug. I'd like to book a seat on the next plane to London. - She booked a plane to London 9·.45. - Heathrow? . - Mom? . - Here.

Um, I'm just gonan leave you guys in there to talk this to talk this through. You know, some of us are actually working here. Hey, listen to this. Mr Yuan's victory in the ballot was a shock, as pre-selection was expected to go to Les Danzenick, the popular local man. What? - Petey won. - Our rubber-loving friend. And new local member. He's cancelled all his appointments. I wonder if he's wearing his rubber undies in this photo? You know, it's obvious why they want him for parliament. He'll just rubber stamp everything. Hi. Nat, how much do you think this place would go for it it was sold? I don't know. The fit-out alone is expensive. Why? Apparently, it's on the market. One of my clients told me. It's gossip. I wouldn't take any notice. He seemed to know what he was talking about. Would you be interested in buying a share in this place? I would make that decision if and when it became an issue. So I don't know, do I? Would you excuse me? How'd you find me? - I bribed your driver. - Achilles? Mmm. I suspect he thought you might like to see me. I'll sack him for that. Come in. Should I ask, uh, why you're not at home? It's a long story. You want a tea or a coffee? Vodka? How about an answer to my proposal? - I'd like to book you. - What, now? You've had a fair while now. I didn't realise you were in such a rush, Tim. Mmm. But the answer's no. I can't do it. - Really? - Really. I'm not gonna sleep with you, Tim. My life's screwed up enough as it is. Oh. Well, that's a shame. Because I was hoping we could spend one last evening together. You watch too much daytime television. Mel, I'm getting married. Yeah, right. So what's her name? Actually, no, I don't want to know. I'm sorry, Mel. I should've told you before. No, no. You have now. It's just that I thought you already knew. Every magazine on earth's been snooping around. I don't read any of that crap. Haven't for years. Especially nothing written about you. You know, I think we should skip the wine and go straight for the brandy. Except, or course, I don't actually drink brandy. Mel, can you just... can you just calm down a second? Just stop a minute, OK? - I'm fine, Tim! I'm fine. - Yeah, sure you are. Tell me what's bugging you. Nothing to tell. Corkscrew. Ah, bingo. So, you want one more for the road, huh? That's one way of putting it, yeah. Screw-top! [ Laughs ] Here's to me. Drinking the profits? Yeah. Yep, that's it. So you're selling the place and, as usual, I'm the last to know. Who told you that? I'm not selling the place, Nat. Just... exploring the possibilities. And if I do there'll be something in it for you. [ Laughs ] You gonna look after me, Dad? Yeah, of course. I never wanted you here in the first place. I'll be out of a job. You're a natural. You'll get another one, easy. I don't want another job. I love this place. I love the girls. I love the clients. I love every sick weirdo that walks through that door. You might be on the papers, but I'm the soul of this place. And you, you just treat it like a personal lolly shop. The money, girls... I've never been involved with anyone before. You know that. You love her, don't you? It happens. You like a handful, don't you, Dad? So... It's come to this. I'm not done yet. I'll drink to that. Cheers. I can't. Can't what? I can't not do this again. I can't imagine it. Shh. It's true. It's true. That's good. - That's good. - [ Gasps ] You used to stay here when we first met, remember? So it's absolutely certain. - Hmm? - You, getting married. Oh. Any last-minute regrets? So who is she? - Victoria Cameron. - Victoria? Oh. - The Western Australian Camersons. - Mmm. That's good. At least she's bringing something to the table. - Well, her father is. - It's all tied up in trust. Just make sure you watch your back. There'll be a prenup. Just another deal, Tim? No, I really like her. Good. She certainly gets around. She's everywhere. I hope not. Um, can we not talk about this right now? Sure. Whatever you want. Will you tell me one thing, though? And you have to promise to tell me the truth. I was never in the running, was I? That's not a question that means anything. Come on, it's OK. I was never even in the ballpark. Mum, don't lie to me. They want you to go back to work. No, they don't. It's not gonna happen. Well, I think you should. I don't think you should have to give up just because of me. - Is that right? - I love that you're a prostitute. But what would I know? I'm asleep. I don't even know what we're talking about. [ Goat BAAS ] [ Goat BAAS ] [ Gasps ] - Hey, hey, hey! - [ Sobs ] - Stop, stop, stop! - [ Continues Sobbing ] Stop, stop! - Are you OK? - No. What's happened? Josh, I think my brain's gonna explode. Why? I just had a dream about when I ran away from home. You know, with that truck driver. Baby, we've been through this. I knew what I was doing. I did. But at the time I thought this is an improvement on anything else in my life. Because the rest was a total disaster. Come here. That's why I did it. Because I wanted a life. I know. And then this nun came into work the other night and I spanked her. - Right. - And all I could see was me spanking myself as punishment for what I do. You have to stop being so hard on yourself. And I keep seeing goats. I know. You keep talking about them in your sleep. It was the first thing I saw after that truckie. This goat, just staring and judging me. I don't care what you do. If you want to go back to work, you go back to work. And I'm not gonna hassle you about that. Come here. Come here. Shh. Do you really want to get married? Yes. But not to somebody that thinks I'm a goat. No, seriously. If I went back to work, would you still want to marry me? Are you gonna make me wear a suit? You look great. Yeah. I feel it. - New phone. - Yeah. Smashed the other one. Alright. Well, that'll explain it. Why I haven't able to reach you. I'm really sorry about the money. Don't worry about it. 232's on the market now. Shit, is that my fault? It's mine, for not paying my tax. I will pay back every penny. I will work twice as hard as I've ever worked, I promise. Is that where you've been, Mel? Working? - No. - Then where? I've been in a hotel trying to figure out who I am. - By yourself? - Why the fuck does that matter? It matters, OK? It matters. I'm sorry. I made a mistake. - Oh, shit. Mel, don't. Don't! - I'm sorry. - Will you not... - Stop it, Mick! OK. Money's gone, alright? I don't care. If you think this is about money, you don't know me. I need you to talk to me, Mel. Give me the full picture. I need to know where I fit in. You're getting married. Are you cool with that? Yeah. Yeah, of course I am. Except? Except what? Except, Bonnie, I can read you like a book. Well, that means you'll be my stepfather, right? Yeah. - [ Laughs ] I guess so. - Well... You're not gonna get all stepfather on me, are you? Like yell at me to do my homework or ground me or tell me what boys to go out with? Um, that last part... yeah, probably. OK. Well, I'll just tell you to fuck off. - But you already do that. - That won't change. Fine. Are you OK with me not being so cool, not a rock star anymore? - Were you ever? - [ Laughs ] Ouch! What about if I became an accountant? Would you love me any less? Yeah. Mmm, I would too. I hate accountants. [ Laughs ] - I love you, though. - Mmm. - What the hell are you doing here? - I want to talk to you. - Sorry, I'm busy. - No, listen. Please, listen. I need you to help me. I just want to know why. I need to understand why my husband comes to you for sex. Do you have sex with him? Yeah, of course I do. - Do you like it? - [ Laughs ] Why wouldn't I? He's Trent Davis! He won the club's Best and Fairest last year. it doesn't last very long. That's how Trent likes it. What am I supposed to do? You need help from a professional. Remember, it's a game of four quarters and you just play it out. The result's the result but it can't be the focus and take each kick as it comes and never, ever, ever look at the clock - just find the zone and stay there. Oh. Stay there, Trent. Just stay there. I'm not going anywhere, babe. Not a chance. Good. Never sorry about being an undersized player. It takes all types. Er, try something different. Oh, I love your game, Trent. Confidence and surprise are always your best attacks. Oh! Oooh, Trentie! Good. And remember to keep trying. - Do it over and over and over. - Baby! - And over again. - [ Both Pant ] - Oooh, yes! - Oooh! - Oh, yes! - [ Laughs ] - I love my job! - [ Both Moan ] PHIL: End of an era. Where do I sign? Down here and there. No regrets? Don't get me going. When does it go on the market? Tomorrow. That quick? Must be under the pump. Oh, just doing business stuff and the new domestic situation's not exactly cheap. You heard from the kids? Yes. Kate phones me every day. - Really? - Mmm. Ash not so much, but when he does, we talk for ages. How do you think they're doing? They're living in America, Phil. What can I say? Well, I'll get us a couple of drinks to celebrate. [ Phone Rings ] Hello. How much money have you got? Sorry? You and your syndicate. I was wondering, is there room for me? Well, yes. Yes, there is. Does that mean I'm in? Absolutely. That's our 10%. That's great. OK. Um, I'll give you all the details at work. 'Bye. 'Bye. Phil. Oh, we're having a private conversation in there so... Cool with me. How's the hand? Yeah, it's fine. I should've just gone for the heart but I didn't know if you had one. Yeah, right. You know, I thought it was a cliche but it turns out to be true. What's that? All you people - you hate men. All my people? Yeah, Lauren told me. You're a lesbian. Oh. Is that a problem for you, Phil? [ Laughs ] I don't care but this is my house so I really don't need the whole anti-men thing. I'm in Lauren's house and I'm not anti-men in general, Phil, I'm just anti the really dull, controlling ones. You know, why don't you get a dog, get a haircut? Put on the uniform so we know what you're all about? Why don't you have a midlife crisis and run away with the secretary? Oh, wait - you've already done that! You don't know what you're talking about so shut your mouth. Maybe take the kids too - really hit your wife where it hurts. - Jesus! Don't touch me. - Oh, s... [ Screams ] - Phil! - She fell over the bloody stool. You alright? Oh, shit! Shit! For Godsakes, Phil. She's pregnant. I am so sorry. It was Ally who wanted to do this. But they become part of you so quickly. Yes, they do. I should think of a name to honour the baby. I need a name. Yeah. Come here. [ Sighs ] How is she? She's asleep. [ Sighs ] You're lucky she didn't call the police. I had no idea. How could I? So it would've been alright to assault her if she wasn't pregnant? - You told me she was a lesbian. - So? You don't expect lesbians to be pregnant. She's also a sex worker, if you want to know everything. She works in the same place I do. Yeah, right. I'm serious, Phil. That's what I do for a living. I work in a brothel. And one that's actually OK and I'm gonna buy a share in the place when this house is sold. - You're a prostitute? - Sex worker. Took me a while to get the hang of it but somewhere along the line, I got the hang of it. I stopped being, what did you call it? "A dud root." And now people pay me ot have sex with them and yes, I'm OK with that and apparently I'm very good, if demand is anything to go by. Do the kids know? We shouldn't have to burden our children with everything, now, should we, Phil? This is disgusting. Absolutely bloody disgusting. I think you've cornered that market, Phil, all on your own. Yeah, yep. What? [ Clears Throat ] Can I call you back? OK. What are you doing here? I have a proposal for you. Victoria's due here in an hour. That's OK. Won't take long, I promise. [ Clears Throat ] What is it? I need some cash. What's it for? Oh, you could call it a going-away present or you could call it keeping you and me out of the papers. You wouldn't dare. What am I talking about? Of course you would. How much do you want? I didn't come here to blackmail you, Tim. Honestly. I just have a large financial problem and I thought you could help me with it. How much? Well, how much am I worth? I beg your pardon? [ Laughs ] You're an extremely wealthy man, Tim. You should know how much things are worth. [ Laughs ] OK. Er, can I write you a cheque or do you need cash? Cheque's fine. [ Sighs ] You know, it's traditional in most cultures for the bridegroom to receive presents, not to give them out. [ Laughs ] Oh, we've never been traditional. No, I guess not. This is yours plus a little present. It's a decent-sized cheque. Yeah, it is. Where'd you get it? A little windfall so I wanted to give you back what's yours. Plus I don't want you to sell 232. I want us to be partners. I don't want your money, Mel. Why? I don't know where it's been. What if I told you it was a going-away present? That I will never, ever see him again? Why should I believe you? Then don't. Like, what does, um, he get out of that? He gets to keep his name out of the papers. - No shit? - Yep, no shit. I earned this money, Nick. Every single cent. And behind that pseudo-gangster bullshit of yours, you actually know its value. What, and you'd give up working? Yeah, I would, if you'd give up the knives and the tax evasion. We'd run a legitimate business. Both of us. Hands-on. You know, we could do this, Nick. We could really try and make this work. Yeah, and what about us - aside from the business? Well, if you promise to stop stabbing people, I'll go house hunting for us. Hmm. If you ever see this bloke again, I'll stab you both. Several times. [ Laughs ] I'm thinking about a house with a garden. What, are you crazy? Yep. [ Knock on Door ] Heather. Alex is here. Go in. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Well, I charge double for outcalls. I'm sorry. He or she would've had beautiful eyes. And no hair. [ Clanking ] [ Banging ] Hello. Who's there? Whoever it is, I'm armed. - Natalie. - Peter. Jesus! Are you trying to scare me to death? - I've got something for you. - [ Sighs ] I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather be. Me neither. [ Sighs ] Josh. Josh. Hey. Joshua. Joshua Jason Phillips. [ Screams ] [ Giggles ] OK, OK, OK. Stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Mmm. Oooh. - Mmm. [ Kisses ] - [ Laughs ] - Are you making breakfast? - No. - Yes, you are. - [ Laughs ] I want toast and coffee. Hey, guess what? I slept like a baby. And I want an omelette. [ Groans Softly ] No goats, no nightmares. Mmm, tomato and onion. In fact, not a single goat to be seen. Melted cheese and some ham. [ Laughs ] - Listen to us. - Hmm? - We don't need to get married, Josh. - Mmm. We're already there. [ Laughs ] Hmm. [ Birds Chirp ] We're here today to acknowledge baby Jessie. Conceived with hope and carried with love. A tiny miracle that reminds us about the fragility of life and dreams. [ Cries ] Some things are not meant to make sense. Some things are just sent to remind us to to live and to care and to love. Thank you for inviting me into your life. [ Sniffs ] That will always be the sweetest gift. I really think you'll be excited by this property. It truly is something a bit special. Yeah. Oh, look, Nick's running a bit late. Sorry. Hmm. - Do you want to take a look around? - No, no. I'll wait, if that's OK. Sure. No rush. [ Laughs ] Yes, Hank. No... Yes, they're all here. I will tell them. [ Sighs ] Our offer's been submitted. We're about to become partners! - [ Laughs ] - Whoo! Hey, Alex. - Can you take a photo for us? - Sure. Yeah. Come on. Quick. [ Laughs ] ALL: Cheers! [ Women Laugh ] De Luca. [ Groans ] So what sort of work do you do? I was an escort. Right. Now I'm a brothel owner. I think I'll ring him again. Yeah, sure. [ Dials ] [ Phone Rings ] [ Groans ] [ Phone Rings ] [ Phone Rings ] Captioned by Grantman Brown [SHOWER RUNNING] [HUMMING] - Aah! Jeez, Justin. - I'm sorry. - How long have you been there? - A few seconds. - I was listening to you hum in there. - Do you know how creepy that is? - It's not creepy. - No, I'm serious. I gave you a key, but next time maybe you could knock, ring the doorbell, give me a little warning? [PANTING] What? I love you. Becca, I do. I... I love you. Wow, Justin. Thank you. I better go get dressed. Radio interview at 10, more election predictions. - Okay. - Then the call about renewable energy. - What's the tracking on that today? - Up four. - Excellent. - Oh, speaking of what's on the ballot, - I prepared a statement against Prop 8. - I'm already on the record against that. I know you've been here a week, but the senator released his position on the act four months ago. No one remembers four months ago. People are paying attention now. - Look, we realize this is your issue. - My issue? The Supreme Court of California ruled it is illegal to discriminate against gay marriage. Now, forgive me if I'm wrong, Robert, I thought you Republicans were all about respecting State's rights. He's got you on that, Stu. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Sorry to interrupt you, senator. Your 2:00 got pushed to noon. - Tell them he's busy. - No, no. I have to be at that. I agree with Stu. We've already released our statement on Prop 8. We're not coming out again. - No pun intended. - Yeah. I'm gonna take the interview in the car. And tell him about the other. [DOOR CLOSES] - All right, Kitty's brother. - You can call me Kevin. When you start referring to your boss as "senator," I will. In the meantime, talk to this reporter from the Sacramento Tribune. He's threatening to publish some cockamamie story about Governor Kern and the senator involved in some sort of intimate relationship. - What kind of intimate relationship? - The schtupping kind. - The story is he's schtupping her. - I know what schtupping is. That's ridiculous. Isn't it? Let me know how it goes. MAN: No, I agree with you, you know? [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] - Excuse me. Hi. - Hi. Wow, I just... I can't believe this is actually happening. I mean, of course, it should've happened ten minutes ago. - Do you think anything's wrong? - No, no. I'm sure she's just still in her appointment, and she'll be here as soon as she can. Well, I hope she's not lost. I mean, this hospital is like a maze. You know, Robert, I think we should've brought her a gift. I mean, maternity clothes are insanely expensive, and she shouldn't have to pay for that all by herself. - This is just her first visit. - She's our birth mom. She's probably young and might not have a lot of money. We're gonna have plenty of time to, you know, shower her with gifts. [SIGHS] You're right. You're right. Thank you. I'm... You're right. WOMAN: Fine. [DOOR CLOSES] - Ah. Hi. - Hi. I'm so sorry, I thought that we reserved this room for a private meeting. - We did. Sorry. - Oh, with me. Heh. I'm Trish Evans, your birth mom. Oh. Oh, oh, wow. Yeah. - It's so... It's so nice to meet you. - Yes. Yeah, indeed, doctor. - Screw Holly. - I'm out of the closet now, remember? You should've seen her, wielding George Lafferty's phone number around as if it was some weapon against my family. I know. You were terrified. Well, I was. Bringing William's illegitimate son into the mix was not something I wanted to do, and, ha-ha, too bad for Holly, it's not gonna happen. What are you making anyway? Cupcakes for Tommy and Julia's party tonight. I'm not saying telling George was easy. It wasn't. He was devastated at first, and then, in the end, he decided he didn't want Ryan to know anything about it. Even if William is Ryan's biological father, George raised him. - That's all that matters. - Right. Okay. So pick a card. Are you even listening to me? George Lafferty doesn't want anything to do with our family. The whole sordid business is over, done, poof. Right, exactly, poof. Now, come on, pick a card. - Remember what it is. Okay, you got it? - Yeah. Put it back. Don't tell me. Great. You're like a child. You're so excited we're going to Magic Manor tonight. The last time I went there, Tommy was years 10 years old, I taught him his first trick. Yes, I'm excited. He's celebrating his anniversary there tonight. Are you kidding? [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Oh. George. Oh, no. No, no. I was just thinking about you. Now? Really? Okay. Could you do it over here? Okay. Fine. See you in a while. What? He's having second thoughts. He's thinking maybe he should tell Ryan the truth. There goes poof. [SIGHS HEAVILY] TRISH: I take it from your reaction you didn't read my application. - No, but we did. - We did. - We read it, like, a hundred times. - A lot. A lot. I think that when you said your goal was to become a surgeon, we didn't know that you actually were a surgeon. We thought it was more of a long-term thing. And, you know, that you were still a student in Missouri. Well, I'm from Missouri, but I'm doing my residency here. It's a great surprise. What's your specialty? - Neuro. - Wow, a brain surgeon. - Not yet. I'm only in my second year. - Congratulations. - This is gonna be a smart baby. - Yeah. I can only speak for half of the chromosomes. Oh, so the father wasn't exactly a neurosurgeon himself? - Honey, the father was listed as unknown. - I know. We hooked up at a conference. Not my finest hour. - It happens. - And I know you guys said ethnicity doesn't matter. - No. - But he was white, and my mom's Korean, and my dad's black, so I guess you're in for a surprise. [ALL CHUCKLE] Yeah, so brain surgery. That must be a lot of hard work. Is that why you made an adoption plan? Medicine's my baby. I don't have the time or energy for another. Was that decision difficult? Not really. I weighed the pros and cons, and for me, adoption made sense. - Right, right. And how about your family? - Oh, completely supportive. You won't have any long-Iost relatives bugging you. - Oh, we're not at all worried about that. - Yeah, no. I didn't mean it like that. [PAGER VIBRATING] Oh, it's the ER. You guys are great. I feel really good about this. - I gotta run. - No, no, wait, wait. I feel like we just got started. Is that it? I have to travel to Houston for a seminar tomorrow. I could do dinner. We have the anniversary, but we could cancel. But this is much more important. No, that would be great. Okay, I'll call you guys when whatever train wreck downstairs is over. How's that? - Fantastic. - All right. - Thanks. ROBERT: Thank you. - She is fantastic. - Yeah. - She's perfect. - Yeah. No, she is. What, you don't think so? What? No. I'm... I just, you know, I... She did not admit to having any doubt. Don't you think that's a little weird? No, I don't think it's weird. I think it's decisive. Look, this... Honey, this is all good. Don't over think it. Really. Okay? - Yeah. - It's great. - All right, I gotta go. I'll see you later. - Okay. [DOOR OPENS] - George, can't I get you a cup of tea? - No, that's okay. I really don't want to take up too much of your time. Oh, that's okay. I'm the one who opened Pandora's box. What is it they say, ignorance is bliss? Yes, ignorance is bliss. Total and complete and utter bliss. George, maybe you were right the first time. Maybe you should put it in the box, lock it up, throw away the key. Let the past be the past. That's what I thought I wanted. Then Ryan called, and the whole conversation, I felt like I was lying to him. You wanted to protect him. That was your first instinct. George, I think you should go with that instinct. I don't know. Sometimes I think it's me I'm trying to protect. Ryan struggled growing up. It never felt like he fit in. Is this why? Would knowing help him make sense of things? And then I think again how hard he took his mother's death. And now to tell him his whole identity was based on a lie, a lie she told him. I don't think he can handle that. That's why I called you. That's why I can't sleep at night. [TIMER BEEPING] That's the cupcakes. And you really look like you could use one. At this point, I could eat the whole batch. [CHUCKLES] Well, let's just start with one. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Yeah. - Kevin Walker? - Yes. Spencer Travis from the Sacramento Tribune. Thanks for coming by. Take a seat. It's good to see that nepotism's alive and well. Okay, let's set the record straight. I didn't get this job... I'd rather set the record straight on something else, like that rumor floating around about the governor's affair. We got a tip, camped out at the Hotel Gerard. Did you try the restaurant? Four stars. - I hear it's fantastic. - I've got photographs. That's Governor Kern arriving at 11 a.m. Through the back door. That's 20 minutes later. Senator McCallister through the same door. - They both checked in under aliases. - Irrelevant. - They're both public figures. - That doesn't seem irrelevant to me. It seems like they don't want anyone to know. You know, there's an election going on. I'm sure you could get a bigger story than this. Heh. Well, this is a big story. It's not as big as the libel suit you'd be facing if you run with it. That's interesting. So far you've given me irrelevant, and now you've given me libel, but not once have you denied it. [CHUCKLES] - Look, I'm denying it. - I'm gonna give you 24 hours to tell me what happened at that meeting, and then I'm running the story. Fine. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] All right, so call ICU, make sure they've got a bed ready. Excuse me, Trish. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Dr. Evans. Hi. I'll meet you in postop. Kitty. What's going on? Well, I was just wondering if it would be possible for me to ask you a couple of questions before dinner. Well, I've got about three minutes, so shoot. Okay, okay. Well, this might sound silly, but I've always been under the assumption that our birth mother would be... Um... Well, you know, some kind of messed up kid. But you... See, you could do this. I mean, even if you work nonstop, you could hire a nanny. Ha-ha. I don't want a nanny. I just keeping thinking about what you said this morning, how your career is your baby, and I used to say the same thing, and then I changed my mind. So I just wanted to make sure that you've, you know, thought this through. Kitty, I'm a surgeon. I think everything through. For now, but what about when you finish your residency? You know what happens to egg quality. I really don't need a reproductive health lecture. Oh, no. I'm... No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. All I'm saying is that things change. I mean, what's going to happen when you see the heartbeat or you see the little toes or... - I've seen the toes. - Okay, well, what about when your friends all start having babies, and all they talk about are strollers and onesies and Baby Mozart? Okay, stop, stop. Look, they make us sit down for a reason: So we can see if this works for both of us. - Right. - Obviously, it doesn't. No, no, no. That is not what I'm saying at all. - I just wanna be sure that you're sure. - Kitty, I deal with enough neuroses with my patients. I'm sorry. Well, wait. What about dinner? I've been on call for 36 hours. Let's not waste each other's time. Can we talk? Talk to Stu. I don't weigh in by the hour. That reporter has photographs of you and the governor sneaking into Hotel Gerard. Kevin, I spent $40 million last year trying to get my face in front of the American people. I'd like to think that I can't sneak in anywhere. Are you having an affair? Kitty's my sister. I have a right to ask. You know, this morning it was the antigay marriage initiative, now it's your sister. This job isn't about your personal issues. It's about you supporting and protecting my professional agenda. - I can't do that if I don't have the facts. - The facts are I met with the governor to discuss a sensitive political issue. - Beyond that, it is confidential. - Oh, okay. And the meeting you ran off to this morning, is that confidential too? That meeting was with our birth mother, who, by the way, happens to be amazing. But if she picks up the paper tomorrow and reads a slanderous story about me and another government official, she could change her mind. So if you're really concerned with your sister, not to mention your job, you'll suck it up and you'll figure out a way to fix it. And you better figure out a way to trust me, or this isn't gonna work out. If you don't mind. [PLAYING GUITAR CHORDS] Did you guys read the focus-group report? The web applications aren't user-friendly enough. No way. A chimp could navigate that program. Well, we didn't test it on a chimp. Listen, people just want to enter a product, and find out the greenest way to get it. - What'd they think of our graph? - The colors are confusing. If the asparagus is flown in from Argentina, it's red, but if it's trucked in from Mexico, it's orange. It's because it's all about mileage. More mileage, more gas, more damage to the environment. I don't understand why that's difficult. Because people think it is. Page 26. Oh, nice, E. - Draw her a rocket ship. - Look, I don't need to see his rocket ship. - Heh. - Nice. [CHUCKLES] Whoa, hey. What's with this magic stuff? It's for my brother's anniversary party at Magic Manor. Listen, guys, could we please focus? I don't know. We may have lost him. You're looking at the magic club president. I don't care if he's David Blaine. And the music? I married a failed musician. I'd really prefer not to be working with one. - This is our process. - Well, it's not mine, okay? At my house, no magic tricks, no music, no fricking rocket ships or crazy robots. [PHONE RINGS] I have two kids, a mortgage. I don't have time for this. - Hello. - All right, I'm panicked. The parlor magician canceled on the day of the party. - What's a parlor magician? ETHAN: Oh, I know. It's the guy from Victorian times who walked around the parlor doing tricks. JULIA: So much for the magic of Tommy and Julia. What's a magic party without a magician? It's a disaster, that's what it is. - I think I might have a substitute for you. - You do? - Sarah, how is that even possible? SARAH: It's magic. He'll be there at 6. This is just so crazy. Ryan has five half siblings. He doesn't even know who they are. That's not how life's supposed to go. You and I, we're the parents, before you know it, we'll be dead and gone. - Oh, now that's cheerful. - You know what I mean. Your siblings are with you for the long haul. Well, I can't argue with you there. My brother Saul is my best friend, and my kids have always had each other. They fight, but they've always had each other. I actually wish I could meet them. It's like I need a crystal ball or something. I can't believe I'm gonna say this. Why don't you come to the party tonight? You could see for yourself. Maybe it would help you make a decision. It would. But then what if I decide not to pursue it? Your whole family would know. Well, no one knows you except Kitty, and she's not even gonna be there. So we just tell them I'm some handsome stranger you picked up? Yeah. Bob. Bob? No, I don't want to be Bob. How about Mick Jagger? Well, I don't think they'd believe that. How about Bob Jagger? And we met... Wait, where did we meet? A widow's mixer. First you wanna a rock 'n' roll star, and then you're trolling for widows? How about Dylan Jagger? You are so stuck in the '60s. [DOORBELL RINGS] REBECCA: Come in. [DOORBELL RINGS] - Just use your key. - I thought you wanted me to ring the bell. Seriously? I didn't mean never use your key. That's kind of a mixed signal, don't you think? This is about this morning, isn't it? - Listen, I wasn't expecting... - Please don't explain. - I didn't want to say it because you said it. - Rebecca... You got to find your moment. I wanna find mine. Can we just drop this? Let's just go to the party, all right? Everything's fine. Great. Exactly what I'm in the mood for, an anniversary party. Awesome. [DOOR OPENS] Oh, hey. I thought we were meeting at the restaurant. [SIGHS] No. - Trish canceled dinner. - Oh. - Did something come up at the hospital? - No, actually, it's much worse than that. She... She changed her mind about the adoption. - What are you talking about? - Look, I know how much you loved her, but I had a very weird feeling, so I went to the hospital, - I stopped by to see her. - You stopped by? I wanted to talk to her. And the minute I brought up some issues, she pulled out on the spot. But things were perfect. They were more than perfect. - That's what you thought. - No, that's what Trish said. And now the whole adoption is off? What on earth did you say to her? I just told her that I was a career woman myself, and that I didn't want to have a baby, and now I did. I just wanted to make sure that she considered what it would feel like to give up a baby at her age. - You mentioned her age? - This is not my fault. She was gonna change her mind no matter what, or she never would've reacted that way. I don't get it. Do you even want this? - Of course I want this. - Then how, after everything we've been through, when we finally get chosen by a woman who is smart and talented and more than we ever could've hoped for in a birth mother, do you choose to go and confront her on her decision? Because we were about to get our hearts broken. Well, if you're not ready to have your heart broken, you're not ready to be a parent. - You don't have to walk away. - Yeah, I do. WOMAN 1: Now he did it. WOMAN 2: I know. - Tommy. - Hey, guys. Happy anniversary. Yeah. Julia went all out. Guess she still loves me, huh? Must be nice. I'm gonna go get a drink. - What's...? - Don't ask. NORA: Hi, boys. - Hey, Mom. - Happy anniversary. - Thank you. - Sweetheart, hi. - Hi, Mom. Boys, I would like you to meet my friend Elton. - Elton? - It's a family name. - Lot of people named Elton. - No, I didn't mean it like... Sorry. - I'm Tommy. - Hi. Congratulations. - I hear it's your anniversary. - Thank you. Tommy runs the family business. He's the one that put the winery in, and he has the most beautiful little daughter, Elizabeth, my granddaughter. And this is my son Justin. WOMAN: I know, I shouldn't have said that. Well, that about sums it up. Pick a card. - That's the one you want? - Yes. - You sure? Positive. - Positive. ETHAN: Okay. Was that your card? JULIA: No way. - How'd you do that? That's great. - Thank you. - He's great, Julia. I know. Sarah found him. I have no idea how. You know, I have my sources. Okay, Miss Clara the fortuneteller knew everything about me. Knew my first pet's name started with a W. This miniature Bijon my parents used to have. She knew I had trouble making decisions, which is not gonna affect us and our business. Um... Mm? - Hi, I'm Kyle. - I'm Julia. KYLE: Julia, nice to meet you. - Hi. Holly. Nice to meet you. Sarah's business partner. - Yeah, I'm consulting for... KYLE: Consulting? You're, like, one of the founders. So is he. We're starting an internet company. Oh, I didn't realize that you were in business with a magician. - Give it a break, Holly. - Sarah, so who's your mom's new guy? - Mom has a guy? JULIA: You don't know? She brought a guy. Hmm. Excuse me. Thank you. So how do you two know each other? - Ah-ha-ha. It's funny. - No, it is. - It's really a funny story. - It's very funny. SARAH: Hey, guys. - Hey. - Isn't this great? I feel like a kid again. - This is my beautiful daughter Sarah. - Elton. GEORGE: Hi. - Elton. - Mom was gonna tell us how they met. Oh, God. I love the "how we met" stories. Go on. We were at a restaurant a... Not together. We weren't together, were we? And this man began to choke. [BOTH LAUGH NERVOUSLY] And Elton, he just went over there and gave him the Heimlich maneuver, - just like that. - Nora called the paramedics. And then we started talking, and we have just so much in common. - Hilarious. SARAH: Wow, Mom. Some guy almost dies, and you go score a date. - Good girl. - It's not a date, per se. - Yeah, and don't worry. He was fine. - Yeah. - Once he spit out the fish bone. - Ham gristle. - Ham gristle? - Was it fish bones? - It was a fish bone. - Yeah. Oh, it was a fish bone. I didn't even know what it was. Okay, so why don't you kids go have some fun? We're going to go and enjoy the magic and all that. - Nice meeting you. - You too, Elton. - What was that? - Guess mom has a new boyfriend. Elton? Really? Ah. I see it. Look toward the bottom of the cup. See how the leaves form the shape of a heart? Sort of, if I squint. - What does that mean? - It means there's a great love in store. - Someone is out there waiting for you. - Yeah, that would be my boyfriend. He's out there waiting for me to say "I love you." Actually, the placement indicates the distant future. - It could take years to meet this person. - Years? What about now? What are you saying, that Justin's love isn't great? - I can only interpret what's here. - You don't even know him. I mean, you're just reading some leftover dregs from a stupid teacup. It's not stupid, unless your spirit is closed. My spirit is not closed. I mean, who said that my spirit is closed? Your spirit is closed. Look, I know you think you're in love, but I promise, another few years, a great love will come along. You're not even going to remember this guy. This is wonderful, Ethan. Great. Oh, Kevin, you're here. You just missed some fantastic magic. Not a fan, remember? I actually need your advice, okay? You worked for your brother-in-law. What did you do when Dad did things you didn't like? I don't know what you're talking about. Okay, you didn't tell Mom about Holly for one thing. I didn't tell your mother because I thought I was protecting her. My job is to protect Robert, and I'm not saying he's Dad, but he's asking me to cover for him without telling me what it is I'm covering. All he says is I have to trust him. Do you? I don't know. We all know you're the family cynic. I mean, certainly, that's why you hate magic. You just are always looking for the angle. You can't give in to the illusion. But Robert is not an illusion. That's what you're gonna have to decide for yourself, if he's putting one over on you or if Robert is the real thing. And by the way, Kevin, if you can't trust him, don't work for him. - Make it, you know? - Excuse me, sorry. - Hey. - Can I talk to you? Where you been? I've been looking all over for you. I love you. - You do? - Mm-hm. Yeah. God, that felt good. Heh. Wow. - Damn right, that feels good. - Ha-ha. I know. I feel like there's weight off my shoulders. That woman had no idea what she was talking about. GUEST: Yeah. - What woman? Nothing. Just this fortuneteller. She said that you're not my great love. Whatever. Wait, that's why you said it, because some fortuneteller told you we were doomed? So this is your moment? Rebecca, this seems like a lame protest to me. - Why are you making such a big deal? - Well, I'm sorry, where I come from, saying "I love you" comes from the people saying it. Okay, well, sorry. I can't seem to say anything right. Why don't you just write me a script? You know what? I'm gonna give you these back. And when you figure it out, you let me know, all right? - So Elton? - Yes, Elton. Why are you guys so hung up on his name? Have you guys done the dance with no pants? - Sarah. - What? Come on. One of us should be having sex, and sadly, it's not me. Well, it's not me either. Just because I brought a friend to the party does not mean we're sleeping together. You brought two men. I'm not accusing you of having a ménage à trois. - Mom. - Well, you're the one who brought up sex. Well, I regret it. Almost as much as I regret bringing Ethan and Kyle. Holly practically did a cartwheel when she heard we were in business together. Holly doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. I don't know, Mom. Maybe she's right. I mean, a start-up in this financial climate? Bear Stearns can't even keep afloat, and I'm in business with a magician who wants to show me his rocket ship. - Oh, no. SARAH: You think I made a mistake. - Oh, my God. - Oh, God. It's bad. I really screwed up. - Oh, hey. - Kitty, what are you doing here? I thought you were meeting with your birth mother. - Yeah. - Well, I... It's a long story. - Well, good. Tell Sarah about it. - Whoa. - Ugh. What the is up with mom? - I don't know. She's been acting weird all night. She brought this guy. - Elton. - Elton? Exactly. What's with the briefcase? Robert won't give you the night off? - Kevin has a new job. - Yeah, he's a lawyer-turned-Republican. - I'm still a Democrat, dumb-ass. - Why don't you be nice? - You'll embarrass your mother's date. - It's not really a date. Elton, there you are. You know, it's such a lovely evening out. - Why don't we take a walk? - That sounds like a date to me. I was really enjoying talking to your family. - Oh. Hi. - Kitty. SARAH: This is funny. George? - What are you doing here? - This is Elton. That's Mom's date. Don't be rude. Do you want a drink? - Ah. You're dating Ryan's dad? - No, she's dating Elton Richards. - I'm not dating him. - What? I'm sorry. Excuse me. No, no. This is George Lafferty. JUSTIN: What? - Ryan's George Lafferty? KEVIN: Mom. - Mom, I knew you were hiding something. KEVIN: Mom. All right, fine. George, this is my family. Family, this is George Lafferty. Hi. Oh, my God. TOMMY: Unbelievable. JUSTIN: I thought you... Since when are you friends with George Lafferty? - He kicked us out of his house. - You were to his house? - Look, this is really all my fault. - No, it is not. I invited you here to meet Ryan's half siblings. I'm sorry we deceived you, but George needs to figure this out. I thought meeting you might help. What is this, a big audition to see if we're up to sibling snuff, Mom? - What's going on? Is everything okay? - Oh, hey, Julia. - Yes, fine. It's a lovely party. - I heard yelling. Our family? No. - We're just all catching up with George. - You mean Elton. How about some cupcakes? - Can you believe our mom? - Nothing our mom does shocks me anymore. [SIGHS] - Why are you so out of breath? - I've been looking for you. - Well, where's Scotty? - He couldn't get time off work. - Where's Robert? - Robert's at home being furious. Really? How furious? I went to see our birth mother. Oh, of course. Oh, good. - Good, good, good. - Oh, no. No, Kevin. Not good. Bad. Very bad. She changed her mind about the adoption. She's not gonna go through with it, not with us anyway. What, did she hear something about Robert? No. No, she loved Robert. It was me. I showed up with all of these questions because I wanted proof - that she wasn't gonna change her mind. - What's wrong with wanting proof? Well, what's wrong with it is that she couldn't give it to me, obviously. And she shouldn't have to. Mm. But it has nothing to do with Robert? Would you stop trying to make this about Robert? - This is about me. - All right. Kevin, I'm serious. I think I made a very big mistake. I... I couldn't trust her and... And now we don't have a baby. So fix it. MAN: Here you go, sir. CLARA: Looks like someone is on the horizon. Someone who will bring great upheaval into your life. No, no, no. I thought so too, but that's wrong. - No, this reading's clear. - The reading is wrong. George is actually a very nice guy just caught in a really difficult situation. I can identify with that. Well, the way these cards are spread, this person represents a threat. Maybe it's talking about his son Ryan. And I'm telling you right now, I am done being scared. Siblings should meet each other. I think we're finally gonna get the chance to meet him. And I'm actually happy about that. - That's good. - Yeah. That's great. What else do they say? Ladies and gentlemen, I know many of you don't believe in magic. Instead, you search for an explanation. There must be something I'm not telling you, something I'm hiding. You're right. Most of the time, magic is about sleight of hand, the principle of misdirection. I make you look one way, so you forget to look the other. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] Hi. Have you seen a young woman, light brown hair, tall? I seem to have lost my daughter. - No, but I'll keep an eye out. - Okay. - What her name? - Rebecca. Thanks. Uh... Wait. Are you... Are you Holly? - Yeah. - I'm George Lafferty. Oh, my God. You're Ryan's dad. [CHUCKLES] - I guess you've heard about me too. - Yeah. I hope you don't mind, but Nora told me about what happened with your daughter. No, I don't mind. It's just that she might not be the most reliable narrator. Well, it's probably pretty complicated between you two. No, actually, it's quite simple. But I do know what it's like to be in your position, so if there's ever anything that I can do... - Holly? - Hmm? Uh... I do have a few questions. Sure. Watch closely because with Julia's help, you're about to see something so amazing, so improbable, it's hard to chalk it up to any fact or principle. Man has always dreamed of conquering gravity. In the 1800s, European audiences saw, for the first time, people rise unassisted off... So you called me down here. What do you got? There's an exit out that way. ETHAN: Just maybe it's magic. With one snap of my fingers, the lovely Julia will fall into a deep, deep sleep. [SNAPS] [CROWD CHUCKLING] [SNAPS] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] - Nora. - Oh! Oh, George. Sorry. - I got sucked into watching the show. - It's okay. I have to go. Go? What do you mean? You know, your family's lovely and very seductive... Seductive? All right, which one of them hit on you? It's not like that. I was right the first time. This was a mistake. It won't be good for Ryan, or any of us. I'd rather leave it alone. - I don't understand. - Our families are what they are. Let's not destroy anything. Goodbye, Nora. [CROWD APPLAUDING, CHATTERING] [FOOTSTEPS] - Hi. - Hey. - How was the party? - Oh, God. Never a dull moment. I'll tell you all about that later. Robert... I am really, really sorry. I never should've gone to Trish without telling you. I don't know why, but I just let my anxiety get the best of me. And I knew how you felt about her, and I didn't want you to think that I was crazy and... I love you when you're crazy. But what I don't love is when you go off, you know, without me and don't tell me about it. You know, we're gonna be parents, so we need to be... - Trusting each other. - I do trust you. It's just... It's everybody else in the world that I don't trust. And I just didn't know if I could do it again. I mean, we've already lost a baby, and I... - Oh, is that what this is all about? - Oh, it's everything, you know? It's all the fertility treatments that didn't work, and all the pregnancy tests that came back negative. And I just... I have had my heart broken. Many times. But I am ready to be a parent. - I know. - And I'm gonna fix it. I'm gonna make this right with Trish. I promise. I'm... I'm gonna fix it. [DOORBELL RINGS] - There she is. - Good morning. SARAH: Hey. - Coffee? Thank you. - What time is it? - It's on time. - You laid down the law, remember? - Have you guys been to bed? Are you kidding? I worked a night at the Magic Manor. - That's like playing Carnegie Hall. - Check this out. See that? New web application. Simplified, streamlined, sexy. - And a new carbon footprint graph. - You did this last night? We may act like we're stupid. - We're not. - You don't act stupid. - You act 20. - We're older than that. I know. Sorry. Listen, working with you guys, it's a little bit of an adjustment. - I have a lot at stake. - Yeah? Well, so do we. You should see our credit card bills. We're not gonna fail. Miss Clara last night told me we're gonna make boatloads of money. - Heh. - You just gotta trust the process. Maybe you're right. - Ethan, draw me a rocket ship. - Yes, ma'am. [SARAH CHUCKLES] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] You seen the paper today? No, I was just... "Senator Robert McCallister had a private meeting with fellow Republican Governor Eve Kern urging her to release a strong statement against the limited marriage act in time for the general election." - Any word of an affair? - Nope. Just a follow-up from the governor reaffirming all Californians' rights to marry. Stu said make it go away. I made it go away. While forwarding your own political agenda. You know, I'm gonna take about five minutes before I fire you. - Look, I was just... - This is grounds for termination. When you're in a foxhole with someone, you need to know the man who's got your back, and right now, I don't know who you are. I had to deal with that reporter on the fly. That statement I had for Proposition 8 was in my briefcase. It was at my disposal. I used it. Do I think you should've released it of your own accord? Absolutely, but I was not out to undermine you. If you had trusted me with the actual information, I wouldn't have had to resort to this. Okay. The governor's having an affair. And it's messy, and there are children involved, and she wanted to meet with me to get my advice. And I told her she's gotta come clean, but I don't know where this is gonna end. Kevin, you have my trust, but there are gonna be times when I'm not gonna be able to tell you everything. Fair enough. Here. Wait. This isn't Spencer's article. No, no. That's an op-ed piece by Henry Myers. That guy's been pissing on me since the day I got elected. Now all of a sudden, I'm a hero. Good job. [DOOR OPENS] Thank you, senator. [DOOR CLOSES] Seductive? Our family is seductive? No. This came right from Holly. Oh, you don't know that, Nora. Maybe George decided on his own. No, no, no, she had it written all over her face. This woman lives to get at me. First she pushes me to find George and tell him the truth. The minute he starts connecting with our family, - she sends him running for the hills. - Isn't that what you want? Poof? Remember? Holly doesn't have anything on you now. It's all over. Yeah. I can't help feeling there's something looming on the horizon. Oh, it's a bit overdramatic, wouldn't you say? Even the fortuneteller said that. Now who's buying into magic? She said someone would come into our lives that would cause great upheaval. And she said that I would meet a nice woman and I would settle down. Oh. Whoops. All right. You're right. What am I worried about? This is exactly what I wanted, and it's the best thing. It's the very, very best thing. It's the best thing. KITTY: Just tell her to hold on one second because I'm here. I'm right outside. I was... Oh! - Trish. - Kitty, you can't keep showing up. I know. You're on your way to the airport, but I owe you an apology. I just got scared because you remind me so much of me, and I know how much I want this baby. And I know that that's me. That's not you. But I promise, I promise there will be no more second guessing. I'm just gonna take the leap. I'm gonna be like one of your patients. My life is in your hands. And not that you can't change your mind, because of course you have every right to. It's just that I don't want to change it for you. So I'm just gonna hang back and wait and... And trust you. Well, thank you. But I already called my social worker. She's sending me a new batch of files. Oh, no, no, no. Please, please. Wait, wait, wait. Don't do that. Don't do that. Robert and I are the same people that you picked. - And we... - Kitty, there Of course, Mr. Legrain, I understand it, but you're always so busy, and now is a good opportunity. Mademoiselle, stay away from this case. Thus will be better both for your mother and you. This is my advice for you. Where did you sit? - There. - Go then. Yes? Got you. - The authorities decided to exchange you for the hostages on the plane. - I know it. Personally, I am against it. I would rather... I would rather shoot you at the attempt to escape. I know it. I know much about people. If you decide to return to my country, keep in mind: I look forward for meeting you. Don't dramatize. You are as safe for me as a ladybird. There is too much democracy in your country. Excuse me, don't you have... - Excuse me, don't you have Validol? - Oh, sure. Here you are. - Thank you. Heart? - Yes, it's stuffy here. Thank you. - Oh, no, leave it. I've seen you at the auction. - I've been there.. You are probably upset because you didn't manage to buy the document? It's a big loss. You know, my colleagues in the German Society of Military History Lovers will be very upset and discontented with it. I have never heard about your Society. What is your program, if it's not a secret? We collect and return to life the documents of the last World War. Excuse me, I just want to understand. The document you were trying to buy, reveals one more attempt of assassination, doesn't it? Political terror has always existed. It's a fact, and quite an explicable one. Let's reason. Human life has a certain price, so it cannot be not taken into account in political disagreements. - But thus you justify terrorism. Look, whether we really should attach such a huge importance to terrorism? Every day more people die in car accidents than for all the years of terror. Yes, but it is an accident, while here is the contempt of the human life, cynicism. Starting from the 18th row everybody stays seated! The rest go out through the front door! From the 18th row! Everybody stays seated! Sit down! Go out quickly! Quickly! Attention please! The flight 327 has landed in the Orly airport. The hostages released today in the morning are on board. Excuse me... Oh, it's you. I am so grateful to you. I thought he would kill me. Did you see his eyes? If it were not for you he would probably kill me. Yes, I did. Don't you want to have a coffee? - Sit down, please. - Thank you. Two coffee, please. - Look, do you know who we were exchanged for? - No. I will show you. It's some fantastic person. Look what they write here. His time in prison would end exactly in a month. It's strange. Why all this story with hijacking the plane if he was to be released in a month anyway? That's the point. It's impossible to understand. It's absurd! There must be some sense in his actions. You know, I even like this entire story. Why are you looking at me thus? - How? – In a strange way. Is your surname Lunie? - How do you know? - I recognized you right away. Recognized? Have we met? No, but I have seen you at Legrain's office in Paris and later at the auction in London. Don't be afraid, I won't harm you. Tell me, can I meet your mother? My mother? So it was you who followed her? Followed? Well yes, recently I have noticed that somebody follows her all the time. Was it you? No, it wasn't me. Please, give me your mother's address. She is in danger. I have to go. Ok, Mr. Commissar. Yes, I have her address. Her daughter has just given it to me in the airport. Excuse me, I can't hear. What's the name? Inspector Foch? Ok, I'll wait for him near the hotel. Thank you. Strange, but there is no such number here. I see. She lied to you. The address is false. I fear very much for her life. What can we do? She is no prime minister, she doesn't have the right for personal security. Yes, I see. However, I have a dog. What dog? Belgian shepherd. I don't care where to walk it. I can do it under her windows. And I will get the address from a more reliable source. - What is your name? - Jorge. - Andre. Lear, Lear, let's go back. As we communicated earlier, a group of armed terrorists had hijacked the plane, with 260 passengers on board. The plane landed on the territory of a small tropical state. After negotiations with the authorities the terrorists released the majority of passengers, 210 people. On hijackers' request a van was delivered to the plane ladder. The terrorists, hiding behind the rest of the hostages, tried to leave the plane. However, the snipers located on the hangar roof opened fire. 9 of 14 terrorists were killed on the spot. Two died of injuries, one is in the local hospital. Two more managed to escape. The person who was the reason of hijacking and one of his accomplices managed to leave the airport in the van. The authorities take all the measures to detain the criminals. Francoise... It's him. - Who? - Schoerner. I recognized him. - Which Schoerner? - The one that was in prison. I told you about him. Look, they have released him. Now you will see him young. It's not it, it's Roosevelt. On the next day after arriving to Teheran Roosevelt left the American legation and went to the Soviet Embassy. - Why do I need it all? I have been keeping this tape for 35 years. Nobody has ever seen it. All these years I didn't have anybody to share with. Probably that's why I have written these damned memoirs. And aren't you afraid? Of whom? - Of me, for example. - What do you mean? Nothing. No, I am not afraid of you, no. You know, the American legation was situated in quite a big distance from the Soviet and English Embassies. And Stalin suggested that Roosevelt should relocate his residence to the Soviet Embassy. To avoid travelling back and forth. This invitation was based on the Soviet intelligence information that the saboteurs sent to Teheran were preparing, as Stalin put it, an unpleasant incident against the Big Three. Proceed. - Well? - Better, but still badly. You need to shorten it by 10 seconds. Don't nag at him, it's just a rehearsal. When it comes to the reality, he will run faster. Your papers are ready. You leave in the morning. Schoerner is waiting for you. Dennis Pew arrives on Wednesday, between 9 and 11 Teheran time. That's it. He sank. Your cigar. I am closing. They'll be ready tomorrow. - I need my photos in an hour. - I am closing. And overtime pay is thrice more. I'll pay tenfold. And I'll buy the negative. I have heard a lot of flattering things about you. They say you can do miracles. That you can make two completely different people look like twins. They even say that you don't scruple to falsify documents. - What do you need? If we tell you, there will be two options left: or you'll perform the order, or we'll have to eliminate you. Do you understand it? And do you understand, that you need to pay well for the artistic work? I am sure we'll find a common language. Spit it out. The photo that is being developed there must substitute this one. Enough, ok? Okay. - And won't Mr. Dennis Pew be offended? - He is far away. He doesn't care. Well, I'll try to finish this work by morning. If you come about 10 o'clock... - No, we'll sleep here. - You won't be comfortable here. - It's all right, we'll handle it. - All right. - Good morning. - Good morning. - May I speak to you for a moment? - Of course. - The receptionist said you were wondering about me. - Yes, I wanted to see you. - What is it? - I feel awkward about my refusal. I understand what an uncomfortable situation I have put you in. If you need me, tell me, I will be glad to help you. Thank you. Tell them to shut up. Tell them to answer my questions curtly. Only "yes" or "no". Not a single word more. Ask them whether they'll be ready by day 30. Ask again whether he understood my question well. Will they be absolutely ready by day 30, meaning the day after tomorrow? All right, thank you, Marie. I don't need you more. Is it all? Yes, it is. The car will take you to the hotel. Stop, I'm going out here. - Do you know what the funeral agent is doing now? - The funeral agent? Yes. The funeral agent is crawling through barrels now. - How do you know? - I do. Besides, I know that today he is doing better than 5 days ago. Why, is he an idiot? No, you know, I think he is genius. The devil himself wouldn't invent a better way to get into the English Embassy. The thing is that in this city water supply doesn't exist in the same form as in the other places. There are neither pipes nor water-tower here. Here water flows from the mountains through special channels that lie under entire city. The locals call these channels "ropes". So, there are these ropes under the English Embassy. The hereditary "ropemakers" maintain them. A usual person can't get into them and move there without special training. So, these two are the very "ropemakers" from the English Embassy. - Do you believe in presentiment? - You know that I believe in chance. Yes, chance... It seems to me that the chance is a part of something bigger that we are unaware of. It's like a float on the water surface, and all the main things are in the depth, hidden from us. - Don't worry, Marie. I won't let you be hurt. - Thank you. Andre! Look! - You were right. He's got the guns. - Who brought them? - A stranger came in the cafe with a bag and left without it. - Where's he now? Our people were following him. He's got way. They warned us to stay at our spots and not to leave. Probably they'll come today. So what? You just need to film today, to film and to memorize, that's it. I won't apologize for you being searched and your equipment inspected. Get in the car, please. I suppose that inevitability of the strict security measures is understandable without explanations. Don't leave the car! This is the solemn ceremony of the English King George VI handing a gift for the city of Stalingrad. It was written on the sword's blade: "To the citizens of Stalingrad, people with hearts of steel, from King George VI as a sign of English people's respect" or something like that. - Listen, Max, why did you get involved in this story? – Devil knows. This rascal Schoerner dragged me into it. Is coffee ready? - Yes, right away. All three were photographed after the ceremony. It happened on November 29 at 15.30. It's a pity I wasn't there at the time. - What are you doing? You are crazy! - Don't be mad at me, Francoise. You know, I got used to them very much. When they died I had a feeling that I lost my relatives. Then something happened to my nerves, I dream of all sorts of nonsense at night. I know too much about this rascal Schoerner's past. - Are you afraid? - No, I am not. It's not easy to find me now. Let them look for me. No, you are an idiot. Do you know why I opened the wrong door then? - Why? Schoerner told me to worm into your confidence and find it all out. Well, go on, go on. To find out the main thing: where is your manuscript, and your address. Why haven't you done it then? Why? Maybe I took a pity on you. It's not true, you invented it. No, it's all true. - Hello! - Oh, it's you. - Hello, inspector, aren't you fed up? - Of what? - Of sticking around my windows. - Why, do you live here? - I do. - What a coincidence, isn't it? I think, inspector, that you decided to use the services of the information desk after all. No, not at all. I am just walking my dog here. Show yourself! Isn't it a beautiful dog? Do you like it? Why are you silent, inspector? What's wrong? Go away from here! Now! Do you hear? I don't understand, where to? Wait! Get up, hold on to me. Get up... Who is this? You need to go away from here, today. But not during the day, you'll go at night. This woman can hide you in her basement. She'll come here at midnight by taxi. - But I need to see Legrain. - I'll help you, but not today. Go. This is the very day, Churchill's birthday. You know, Francoise, after the war I read several books about this attempt, strangely, some things happened to be truthful in them. But they all had the same mistake: took the false distractive options for the true ones. Nobody could guess there existed one more option - me. It was the only real danger for the Big Three. - Mustafa's atelier. - Got it. - I ask for 5 minutes only. - No. Everything was fine, the camera worked normally, probably something happened during the search. - I can't. - But such events don't happen every day. All right. You have no more than 5 minutes. Thank you. It's on the way, Mustafa's atelier. I have a problem. The camera's broken. Go ahead. Your camera. Wait there. It's all right. It works. - Tell everyone to get out of the car. - Everyone out of the car, please. - How do you do. - How do you do. Put your equipment down. You may smoke. - Mr. Pew? - Yes. - We would like to check your camera. - It's just been checked. - Nevertheless, we'd like to check it once again. - But there's a tape inside. Don't worry, we have a special room for it. Please. All right, let's go. - Open the camera. - All right, but it's too light here, I'll spoil the film. Open the camera. Hands behind your neck! Go! What are you doing here? Why are you smiling? I think you are hungry. - Awfully. - Let's go. Move! Quickly! Quickly! - Do you know what I am thinking about? - No. I think that I am the happiest person in the world. It's strange, isn't it? They wanted to kill me just now, and I am happy. Marie, you need to go away immediately. Understand, we need to part, there's no other way. I can cause you grief, sadness, maybe even death. All right, I'll send you to the countryside for a few days. You'll be safe there. And I'll come for you in 3 days, all right? Let's go. - Madam is leaving us? - Madam will rest in the country for a few days. - My clinic is small. Seat down, please. - Thank you. Exemplary staff, perfect treatment. There aren't many patients, but they are all decent people. Madam has suffered from headaches before, but this night I was really sacred. I think there's nothing to worry about. Madam will stay with us for 2 or 3 days, we'll run the tests, prescribe the treatment course. The nurse will come right away and take Madam to her room. - Madam Lunie? - Yes. - How are you feeling? - I am better, thank you. But I don't know you. - I am sorry, madam, but I've come for you. - Did something happen? They shot at him... At the hotel entrance. Is he... alive? He's wounded. He asked for you to come. Where did you bring me? Where did you bring me? No need to worry. Where are you taking me? - Come in, sit down. - Connected. - Yes, who do you need? - You. Come immediately. Address: Barkhay str., 7. We have madam Lunie. Do you understand what I'm saying? - I don't believe you have her. - Be so kind, say something. - Andre, they want to kill me. I don't know why, but they want to kill me. - Nonsense. They're scaring you. Where are you? - Andre, I wanted to tell you that I love you. - Yes, we will soon go away from here, soon... Where are you? - I don't know, I... Excuse me. It's me again. - Look, I'll pay you well. - We need no money, but you. How soon can you be here: Barkhay,7. No fooling around. - In an hour. - It's too late. - I won't have time. - Try. - Did I get it right: Barkhay,7? - Rascal! I know there's a person there. Hold it. Hold it tight. Gimmi. That's it. Wait now. - Damn it! - What is it? The coat and the hat. - Coat? -Yes. Why hasn't he taken it off? The coat makes it uncomfortable. Andre sent me. Not a sound! Quiet! Yes? What's up? Hide! Halt! Drop the ladder! Hands! Raise your head. Take the hat off. Who are you? - He made me change. Take him! - Grave digger! - Yes! - Why are you late? - There're raids in the city, Mustafa's taken. - Where's the cameraman? - Arrested. - You were supposed to take the film. - I did. There're general arrests in the city. The English and the Russians together with Iranians. You will get up now and follow me. Hello, Andre! Hello, Marie! Hello, Andre! Marie! What are you thinking about? Damned time. Whether there will never be nothing more? Whether everything's over, gone? No, Marie. Everything stayed. The past is as real as all that is happening now, this very moment. The main thing is not to forget. The main thing is memory. Yes, memory. I remember the small shabby hotel where we stayed in Teheran. You know, it is more real for me than this glass of cognac... or that man over there. And I remember the antiques store, Vijaya covered with dust... and your dreams. Oh God, why are we sitting here? We should go to my place. Wait, let me call my daughter. I am her daughter. My name's Natalie. Yes, yes, I remember you. May I sit down? Yes, of course. Excuse me for not offering. You know, she was in the phone cabin and at that moment the truck... The big truck. My mother told me a lot about you. She... repeated her stories dozens of times. I even remember them by heart with all the details. Every... stone on the road, every movement, every sound. These last days she was always remembering the story with dolphins. Of how you were bathing in the sea and didn't notice that the storm started and... dolphins appeared. Dolphins? But we have never been to the sea. Oh my God, this means... she invented it all. Who? We finally met. - So many years passed. Excuse me. - What do you drink? - Beer. What is it? It's them. I like this film very much. I often watch it, sometimes hours in a row. None of them is alive now. They all died a natural death. And I could have killed them. Churchill at Roosevelt's funeral. And this is his own funeral. So, how have you been living all this time? - I lived richly, well off, but this was the life of a worm. Then they called me. Our people found me and called. And you? - No, I didn't betray my business. There was always a demand for assassination, especially a political one. And recently it became so fashionable, that I had to refuse some offers. Didn't have enough time. Then they stopped coming to me. Really, who needs an old man, when there are so many young ones around? Let me go. Let me go, will you? We don't have much time. Let's go. By the way, I wanted to ask you... out of mere curiosity. Where to did you disappear in Teheran from that "rope"? You were just two steps away from the English Embassy. I am a professional and not a suicide. Already down there, in the well, I understood that I was finished, and escaped through the side track. You know, I still can't understand how they smelled it out about the "ropes". Hands! The manuscript. By the way, Mr. Schoerner, now that we have met, I have one question: why did you need to hijack the plane? There was only one month left until your release from prison. If there was even one hour left, I would have released myself on my own anyway, to prove you that we are still strong. - Excuse me, I am waiting for you, sir. - I don't receive today. I am a foreigner, came from far away. It's about the book. I am interested in some details. - There is no manuscript anymore. - But can I meet the author? - There is no author either. He died. - Was he killed? He died. And what about the film? I've seen it in London. There is nothing left. The negative is also destroyed. Well, we have memory left. What do you mean? Memory. A common human memory. It is the most reliable thing of all. Goodbye. Goodbye. Derected by Alexander ALOV, Vladimir NAUMOV Director of Photography Valentin ZHELEZNYAKOV Starring: Igor KOSTOLEVSKY Natalia BELOKHVOSTIKOVA Alain DELON Curd JURGENS Armen DZHIGARKHANYAN Albert FILOZOV English subtitles by Maria KURCHATOVA LOPES PEREIRA The End STORY OF O One day, her lover takes O where they never go: Park Monceau, Park Montsouris or another, in a bright alley, bordered by a huge dark forest. It'll soon be evening and it's almost autumn. René asks O to take off her underwear. In the car going God knows where, O dares ask nothing, fearing the driver. Take them off. Sit straight on the seat. Never cross your legs or keep your knees together. This is it. Listen: You'll go and ring. Follow whoever opens and obey their orders. You want to? Yes. And you? I'll be here. Go. Another beginning could be more brutal and simpler. O was driven by her lover and an unknown friend. The unknown friend said that her lover was in charge of her preparation. O wondered why her hands were tied, as she was ready to obey her lover. Maybe it was one of his wishes, like leaving her alone, waiting pointlessly for half an hour or an hour or two, I don't know... But it felt like a century. You mustn't keep your knees together. Turn her around. Let us see her. Bondage? No, never. Whip? Not whipping her a little and giving her pleasure. The point is to draw tears from her. Whenever we whip you here, you'll be blindfolded. But not tonight. You'll see yourself the first time. You're proud! I want to hear her scream. Immediately! No! I can't any more! I beg you! No. It leaves too deep marks. Punishment by the whip lasts longer. I want you to use only the whip. As you wish. René! - I did it, you see? - Yes. For you. Yes, for me. Don't get up, remain seated. Tomorrow you'll wear this. It's practical. Show her why. The women in the castle and park dress like this. It makes you available to those wishing to use you. As they wish, whenever they wish. Before I tell you all the rules, I must remind you again you're here voluntarily and you're still free to leave. Do you want to leave? Don't give me that look, you'll feel sorry. One last time, do you want to leave? In that case, you'll have to abide by these rules. You're in an alley that leads to the park. Your servant's Pierre. A servant? The one who'll bind you at night. He'll also whip you. Servants can take us. Pierre, he is... Don't look him in the eyes! - He's what? - You heard. Not in my eyes! I'll return for her. Jeanne and Andrée asked her name. She gave only an initial: O. Your lover sent you? You're lucky. They'll be hard on you. Why? You'll understand. Well, lady? O wondered why charm and terror were so mixed, why terror was so sweet. Get up. Turn around. It's 9 o'clock. Eat quickly, then sleep. You know that? About the sugar? I was told. Enough, we mustn't speak. - Come, Andrée. - But tell me... My love! Come, let's see you. Obey. O felt soiled and guilty of the illicit pleasure she'd had in a stranger's arms. But her lover explained that the more he gave her, the more he wanted her. Offering her to another man was proof that he owned her. One can only give that which one owns. Don't speak. You were told yesterday that during your stay here you mustn't look the men in the eyes or speak to them. From now on, the same rule applies to me. I love you. But before you go totally silent, I want you to pronounce two words. The name of the man for whom I brought you here, to whom I'll introduce you some day. Sir Stephen. It's the cloister. What? No, I said nothing! I apologize! I apologize! No, please! Do anything you want but not that! Take me, do what you want, anything but that! No, anything but that! I'll do what I'm told! Jeanne had broken a rule when she spoke about the cloister. O never found out what had happened. Monique, come closer. Come here! I'm leaving. I'll only come back to take you away. When? In a few days. How many days? Now, if you wish. You want to see me whipped? Yes, so I can picture you when I'm away. Will you be happy? I will, I know it's hard to understand. I must no longer talk to you or look at you. Look at me. It's hard to understand. But you understand, right? Why? Once upon a time, a little girl saw a white rabbit wearing a watch. Her name was Alice. The white rabbit was very late. She wasn't surprised that he could talk. Then? Then, she followed him. Where to? In a deep well. She had many adventures. Go on. What was in the well? Sir Stephen. My hands. I love you. She won't look. She will. No, she won't. She's new, that's all. No. I love her. She's proud. Come on, stop. Pierre is watching you. You like him? Yes. You do? I don't understand. In fact, she liked all that came from her lover, even Pierre. She belonged to her lover through all the strangers she gave herself to. I must prepare you. You won't dine tonight. Please go into the corridor. Why? I want to be alone, there's no door. There are no doors on purpose. Look at me. Look only once. I shan't hit you again... I'll just pretend to. Did I force you at the stairs? O lost count of time. The grass darkened. The days and nights were lost. The light never faded. After a few days, time flowed again. In her velvet night, she was released. Get dressed. We're going. Take it and put it on your index finger. Goodbye. It fits me. Roissy. It hasn't changed. I've lived here for years. Four years. I'm going up. The bathroom. It's so good! This is my room. Your room? You never sleep! I've put a present for you on your bed. Weird, I had no recollection of the kitchen lino. Thank you. He said she'd no longer be free from then on. Unless she'd stopped loving him and left him straightaway. It surprised her that after all that he wanted more proof that she was his. Maybe he knew it but wanted to reinforce it as he took pleasure in that. That's not the way you should listen to me. Come here. Like this? You must keep your lips slightly apart. In the morning, you'll sort your stuff. I'll take what's useless. - It's me. - Good morning, darling. Sorting your stuff? I am. - You're dressed? - I have my nighty on. Take it off. René? Your ring? Yes. Stay naked until I arrive. Pack that which neither comes off easily nor opens at the front. Seeing she had done all he'd asked, he was amazed she belonged to him so much. That's it. Thank you. Will you print some for me? Yes, of course. You look girlish. You've changed a lot. But garters... they damage the legs. They're easy. O made about fifty prints of Jacqueline, nothing like what she'd done before. In her body and face, she found a special charm. René, darling. I'm going for a little while. Be ready in an hour. A car will call. Dress in black. Wear your fur. It's so old! It looks good. Don't be silly! Good enough for a funeral. Please, it's important to me. Fine. You're beautiful. My love, Sir Stephen. René didn't lie. Martini, please. That's what you want, isn't it? Sit down. If you want, we'll dine in the cellar. It's nicer there. We'll have coffee in my house. The couch is yours. René will serve the coffee. Now listen carefully. René may have told you about his family. Before he was born, I was a son to his mother. Then she left my father. So René and I are in no way related. But somehow, we're brothers. We've always shared everything. By the ring you're wearing, I have some rights over you as do other men who know it. But they'd only have quick affairs. With me, you'll have something more serious. If you accept it, I'll tell you his preferences. My demands! I'm yours, I'll do as you say. No, you belong to us both. Say this: "I belong to you both and I'll do what you desire." I want to hear you say you'll be as mine as you're René's. But you'll only have one master, a demanding one, because I have a certain taste for habits and rites. Out the two of you! No... I accept it. Will I be whipped? Yes, a few times. They examined her body in a brutal and abominable way. She was covered in shame. But despite the shame, she felt like someone going into a familiar dream that's about to start. Stay with Sir Stephen. Don't move. He'll dismiss you at his leisure. I'll see you out. Thank you, René. You want the car? You want the dream to end for fear that you might not bear it. Yet you want to know how it ends. Sit down. - A cigarette? - No. I want to see you naked. Undo your blouse. I don't like your make-up. The colour is too pale. Take off your skirt. You're an easy girl. Does René know you desire every man who wants you? It's an alibi, this obedience. No, I love René! Yes, but you're easy. Don't move! Masturbate. You understood. Caress yourself. No, I can't! Is that obedience? René wasn't stern enough. I always obey him. You're mistaking love with obedience. You must obey me without loving me and without me loving you. My room is next door. Wait. It's yours. Keep it. Iron suits you like your ring. Should I say irons? Please, don't tell René I disobeyed. I swear I'll obey. Good morning. A driver will take you. A message from master. René said he would pick you up at the studio. This is for your next visit. I have it. That's good, you look dangerous. To whom? She wanted to say: "To Sir Stephen". But she was afraid. She was afraid of his words to René. Why didn't René come? If Sir Stephen didn't love her, René would stop loving her. You've seen Sir Stephen? Yes. Look! He gave it? Really? Great! I'm proud of you! I feel the same. Have you done my prints? No, I haven't had the time. Oh well, I'm off... Stay. Don't go. Jacqueline came often. This pleased René, who found her attractive and wanted to seduce her. O might have been jealous, but something else worried her: The grip Sir Stephen had on René. Don't be angry. I'm not. I hardly see you! You don't touch me! When you do, it's to find marks on me. You're in love with him, not me. Nonsense! Had I said that two months ago, you'd have slapped me so hard the walls would have shaken. But I'm yours! Yours! Sir Stephen's first! - Listen. - No. I know. Phone him, tell him I can't come tonight. Invent anything. Tonight I'm yours. It's impossible. I shall tell him your words. Good night. She didn't believe he would do it. But they went. He stayed only long enough to tell him. Goodbye. Thank you. He was as pale as she. O thought he was in love with her. He'd never kissed her. But he punished her himself that night. He was so cruel, she lost consciousness. - Is that you? - Of course. Something's happened, I can't decide alone. I've met Pierre from Roissy. - Does he want you? - Yes, now in a hotel. Do you want to go? Yes, I do. Go back to your flat. Not come to you? I want you to obey me. Is that you, René? René gave me a key. I see you obeyed me. You're a big girl. We'll go out. But first, answer my questions. Since your return, have you known other men? Desired others? Besides Pierre, of course. A girl, maybe? That's it, isn't it? Wait. Is it the Jacqueline René told me of? You desire her... Jacqueline has a great life. Sir Stephen made her talk about Jacqueline. But was he listening? She liked to feel that he was aware of her voice, of her moving lips. René knows what I shall say now. Remember the first time you came, I gave you an order you didn't obey. Will you obey it now? Yes, whenever you wish. Drink up. I've seen no one, not even René, take you. It doesn't mean that you'll never give yourself to a stranger in front of him who loves you. He insisted for a long time, but she wasn't listening. She heard only "him who loves you". She needed no more proof. You're not listening to me. I'll do anything you want. I'm yours. Mine? Yours and René's. René and I have agreed you can be mine only. If you agree, I want more than words. If you're only mine, you must be marked. - Marked? - Permanently. Finish your coffee. You're not forced to do anything. You can always refuse and go. I'll give you a few days. Time to take Jacqueline. Jacqueline, mine? I could say, I'd like to see you with a woman. That is not the case. She must be yours to go to Roissy. It's not possible! It is. It's not possible. I won't owe René anything. When she returns, she'll be his. René's? He loves her? He said that? He wants her. She doesn't. So first, persuade her to share your flat. There's another wardrobe for you. Make yourself at home. René doesn't mind? No, he's happy about it. She accepted my room. That's nothing. Sir Stephen was right. She'll give in to you. Good night. Come here. Sit down, don't be afraid. René won't be back? Not tonight. Strange hairdo! Take that off, it's better. Beautiful. Tell me you want it. Yes. It went well, I'll tell you. Yes. Now? Straightaway. - Was it René? - No, it wasn't. - Are you happy because of me? - No... Well, yes. Because of you. Now go, you're late. You don't kiss me? No. See you tonight. When O came to this house, she was first prepared by Norah. O never got used to undressing in front of this woman, who never spoke to her. Now she was taken straight to Sir Stephen, in an unknown room. It's done! I knew you would manage. Take that off. - Shall I tell you? - No, I will. Stop me if I'm wrong. You're beautiful. As for Jacqueline, - you undress her. - Yes. Take off her belt. You look at her in the eyes and talk. He was right. Only through prints, he knew Jacqueline liked pleasure and would give herself freely to O, as she was a woman. Roses... for me? Why not? I love you. Norah! There! They're yours. You told me of a mark. - You accept it? - Absolutely. When? She'll be marked shortly. I assume you'll be there. Yes. Come and see the house. This is your room. Do you like it? Very much. Get undressed. I'll give you a corset. Very tight. We'll tighten it daily. Your waist will be slim. Your stockings. They're a bad idea. Who wanted them? The boy who gave her to me. René, you know him. Kneel down. Do you willingly accept to wear Sir Stephen's rings and signs, unaware of how they come? Yes, I do. I'll accompany him. Stay here. You're really mine. Your companions. Yvonne, Claire, - Andrée... - I know her. And Thérese. I know her too, from school. Be quiet, Thérese. Yvonne, put the corset on her. - Please, help. - Sure. - Glad to see you. - Me too. Very tight. You'll be prettier. Come here. When were you whipped? Two or three weeks ago. We don't whip here. Except tonight. Because of your arrival. O found in Anne-Marie's house tense attitudes, straight out of childhood. I hate losing. Check mate in two moves! - I'm not playing. - Well? Cheat! That's not true! Dirty liar! Come behind me. Not you, O. Who'll whip you? We'll draw lots. Are you ready? Let's do it. Who has the queen? Was it planned? I never arrange things. You know that. Take her away, she's yours. You can scream, no one will hear. And if you shout too loud... Go on, Yvonne. Faster, harder! She must scream! She understood that her attachment to René, her days at the castle, her hardships, were the surest way to take her to him she loved. Thinking? Of him. If she was strong enough to take everything, she would manage to conquer him. Andrée's lover brought her here. Maybe he won't come back. Why is that? You're not strong enough, you'll leave. - Who brought you? - Anne-Marie. - You belong to no one? - She does. She belongs to me. But Thérese wasn't the only one who slept with Anne-Marie. As for everything else, fate decided. Anne-Marie! What are you doing? You're mad! No, don't! I don't want you to! You're silly. I don't care! I want to die, you hear? Poor little thing. Punish me. I don't care. Go to your room. You too. Come, my love. Claire will show you something. - Show her, Claire. - Sure. Sir Stephen wants you to carry the same rings. Once they're on, they can't come off. Painful? No more than an earlobe. But for you there will be more. A ring could be filed off. That's why Sir Stephen wants you marked otherwise. Forever. How? You promised not to ask. I'll tell you in time. Today it's your turn. Pick it up. We haven't drawn lots. I want you to do it. Obey me. No, I can't. Think of what she did to you. You must learn. Sir Stephen told me of Jacqueline. You'll have to hit her. Go on. Don't cheat. All your strength. Come on! Harder! Enough! Forgive me. Forgive me, please. No. - Asleep? - Yes. She loves you? I know she does. What have you done to each other? I want to know! I don't care. You know what? You'll be branded. Sir Stephen's here. Coming. I may not see you again. You want to bet? Sure. You can still refuse. No. - Shall I tie you? - No. Don't touch me. I want to leave! I can't take it! - I want to go! - Fine. Sir Stephen's driver will take you to Paris. There, he'd said he loved her and would give her to others who wouldn't love her. Would he do it? And if so, why? Careful. Thank you. Thank you very much. Better without your hat. Wait. It's yours. - Nice daughter. - He's right. Will you be my daughter? I'll be everything. Give me my gown, please. Rings? First time you notice something outside yourself. Why wear them? - You want to know? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. Now I'm Sir Stephen's. I love him. It's incredible! You're telling me your dreams. Sir Stephen, René, Anne-Marie! Me. Impossible! There's one character I don't like at all. Thérese. You invented her? I invented nothing. What if I want to go to Roissy? For me? I'd like to see it, just out of curiosity. But I wouldn't be touched. A tourist? I'll even sleep with René if you want. If you want. Not yet. When you come to Brittany, I'll give a party. O can be queen. Fine. Get up. Turn around. The mark! It's nice. Look, Ivan. Don't want to. Patience. Proper etiquette. I am sorry. I remembered she has some good aspects. Teacher Yang. You have a really unique judgment when it comes to people. How did you come to select such children... Welcome to 89.1 KBS COOL FM Super Junior's Kiss The Radio. These are our main guests for today. Welcome! Welcome! We'll debut soon. Hi everybody, we are Suk and... Mi. Right. Now that Suk and Mi have been introduced, let's get to know them better... Let's answer the first call. Oh yay. The call really went through! I'm definitely Suk and Mi's most loyal fan! Thank you very much. What do you like about Suk and Mi the most? How should I say it... Each of them represent a different side of human nature. Ah, human nature... Yes. I heard that one member weighed 82 kilograms once! That's really extreme... now she's like a completely different person. I heard that liposuction is not something that can be done easily. What to do...? It was a joke, wasn't it...? Oh... I know who you are...you are Ri Ah, right? If you want to uncover Pil Suk's shortcomings, then come over and do it. Why use such an underhanded method instead? This is a live broadcast! Aiyah... I didn't say it was Pil Suk... Oei, at 82 kgs, other than Pil Suk, who else can it be? Can it be me! ? Furthermore, she did not use liposuction to lose weight, okay! Mmm... You want to die? You better sit down now. Now you're the one who's courting death. You better stay put and not move. Wait a minute. Unni, please connect with us again... Right. There's got to be something that attracts people's attention. President, its not like you did not know this before, why now? I have closed down my nightclub, and this is my first business investment. Of course, I must be cautious. Now I should view things like a businessman, instead of as a spectator. Right...actually there should be no sentiment attached to this "property". I am really disappointed. I had thought President Ma was different from the others. I thought that you were different from other entertainment companies who view money as the goal. Instead the goal is to create artists, and make money from there. This is how I see President Ma too. You just wanted to make more money. Isn't the time when all you thought about were money-making business transactions over? You shouldn't. If it was true, I would be really disappointed. No, of course not. Ok then. That's your answer. What is it? Deceived by that mouth again! Oh man... I am also deceived by that mouth every day! How eloquent can that mouth be? No matter what, after the special training is over, start your debut preparation. Fine. Didn't the country boy get selected? The country boy has stage fright. He has good relative pitch. However, once on stage, his trembling affects the stability of his vocals. He has good relative pitch? Mmm... A million thanks. What's with this fellow? What is good relative pitch? You'll only have to remember this Just focus on the sound of this note. So long as you memorize this note (sound), Allow your vocal cords to remember it. Such as, what would happen? When it comes to relative pitch, your understanding of the different notes stands out. Therefore use this note as a base template, as the seed. The remaining musical notes will grow in you like branches on a tree. Understand? I get it. Even if it's not perfect pitch, the difference is not far off. Hello? Dad? What's the matter? What brings you here? I've received the garland. Thanks. How can secretary Kim decide this independently? No. Yesterday President asked me to send... Sorry. Father. I've been trying really hard. I won't disappoint you. Why is it suddenly like this? Father. I said I'll cheer on Daddy. Do you still remember? Please do your best in next week's election. Fool... Sam Dong hasn't come back yet? It is not Min Do Shi also it is not Moon Dae Shae Under so many names. It has to be Ma Doo Shik. Ya! What to do? Hello. Oh Guk-ah Hey, what's wrong? First, congratulations! Haven't seen the direct broadcast, only seen the rebroadcast. You congratulate me with this kind of face? Yeah, this IS my congratulations face. It hasn't been long since I made my debut, but now, I'll be doing solo. That's why you are getting jealous? It's not jealousy. It's righteous envy! You can congratulate me with a smile. My dad sent me a garland. Your dad? Garland? Yes, right. Really? Congratulations! Congratulations! You had another one? I had another one prepared. Ya! What are you doing? Does it hurt? It's not a dream, then? It's your dream. You confirmed it. Let go! You started it! Let go! We'll let go at the count of three. Okay. 1.. 2.. 3. Sam Dong-ah. Oh, Sam Dong. You're back. Congratulations. You received first place. Mmm...thanks. But, are you all right? I heard you got stage fright. Yes. Don't worry. You guys continue, I'm going in first. Mmm... Hello? Yes, Director. Didn't I say that we don't need this kind of publicity? Let me take care of the president. Where is it now? Where? Fine. Hmm? What's the matter? The president is trying to use my relationship with my father to get me more attention. Really? Is not a big deal, I'll clear it up over there. Take care. I'll call you. Mmm... Hello? President, this is Baek Hee. I have to talk to you about something. Are you in your office right now? Okay, I will come up now. Hey! Oh Hyuk, hurry and get up! I've just received breaking news. I am heading out to investigate now. Jin Guk got involved in a fight. What? I'm in front of Seoul Kangnam River police station right now. The police of GangNam are suspicious of Yi Chen Gi's plan and is putting pressure on it. They are currently investigating this case involving Group K's Hyun Shi Hyuk. That... What can I do for you? I am Mr. Kang Oh Hyuk from Kirin Arts Academy. that... Jin Guk... I mean... Where is Shi Hyuk? in the investigation department assisting with their investigation Sit over there and wait a second. Ah, he is headed this way. Jin Guk. Teacher. We couldn't contact his guardian. There's no one else? No manager or anybody else? I'll take him away. So the Teacher will. Right. Please fill out this form. Show me your ID. We'll need you to assist us with the investigation in a few days. You must come then. Fine. Oh, he came out. He's out! Is it true that Representative Yi got beaten up? What is the reason for this? How are you feeling right now? What did your father say? Have you confirmed it? Will this interfere with your activities? Please explain a little more. - Please speak. - Please say something. Please look here! Look over here. Look over here, too. President Ma has agreed to it. He should be available temporarily. Why did you do it? You don't look like someone who would fight. Not talking? I am sorry. You must be hungry. Starting from the bottom once more. Yesterday, at approximately 11 p.m., Kang Shi Hyuk allegedly beat the stylish planner of the planning office, Representative Yi of Top Entertainment, in Yeoksam-dong Gangnam-gu. - According to the police, Hyun-ssi has admitted his fault. - What does this mean? At 2:00 am, they've finished the first round of the investigation and have gone home. Fractured jaw. Because my waist and neck also got injured. I'm predicted to depend on wheelchair for a period of time. My jaw hurts so much. This heart... This heart of faith believed in a friendship... The police have stated that they are further investigating this matter. After the investigation has ended, they will turn it over to the prosecution. Where's Jin Guk? Do you know where he is now? Because of all the reporters outside, I brought him to the basement hangout place first. So, what happened? Why did he do it? I don't know. He's not saying anything. On the other hand, the violent incident occurred between 9:00pm and 11:00 p.m. The father of the alleged instigator, who is the president of Ocean Group Inc, has maintained his silence so far, even though the he's a candidate in his city's mayoralty election race. Not long ago reports came out regarding the adoption of Jin Guk. It was reported as soon as it happened to President Yi. Therefore, there was no way to stop the report. The other side must be intentionally causing this heavy publicity. Where is my son now? At present, he's at his teacher's home. There's no need to worry, If we were to go look for him now, The publicity over the matter will only get bigger. What's with you these days? -What? -What? Hold on, let's see together. South Korea definitely has the best photo-editing technology in the world. Look here, look here. The King of Assault in the Night. I Am Going to Punch You. My Gangster Like Shin Hyuk. Have you guys watched the movie? Enter the Dragon, Jin Guk. What is this? He's really not joking around. Sunbae... You have to keep this a secret. Remember during the previous showcase, when Jin Guk and Baek Hee were on stage? Yup, I remember. Didn't Baek Hee draw a star on her eye? Star? Oh, ya. I heard that it was to cover a bruise after being hit by Jin Guk. That's what she made us believe. Oh, really? Ah, no way. Our Jin Guk is not that kind of person. Hey In Sung-ah! Sunbae, haven't you heard? Jin Guk's biological father is from the triads. Yeah, I heard. His back has a dragon tattoo this big. Have you seen it before? Now that you're mentioning it, I haven't seen his back before. Looks like it's really true. Ah, really! He even has a tattoo? That's enough. Shut up now. What wrong with him? Let's go. It looks like they're all gone. Let's go in. Yes. Hye Mi, Sam Dong. Jin Guk came back. He's here? He arrived just at the right time. Come. Come, come, come, come. Jin Guk-ah. L... L... Let's eat. Noona boiled some oxtail soup for you. Eat up. It will warm your stomach. Thank you! But I'm not hungry. Yes, right. You must be really sad. There are so many things inside your heart, yet you can't speak them. So then the stomach cannot digest comfortably. This truly grieves me... Just trust Noona this time and simply confess everything. Noona (older sister)! Unnie! Ahjumma? It doesn't look like it will be easy to reach an agreement with Director Yoon. It seems the matter will be settled this way. It looks like I will have to see Director Yoon personally. Before I wanted to listen to what you have to say. I know you're not one type to hit a person without good reason. What did the Director Yoon do to you? Nothing. I was the one who was too hasty. Tell me what you are hiding from me. If we continue like this, we will lose everything. Do you understand? I am sorry. I have caused so much trouble for you. I am so sorry. You told me to, "Cheer up and Go!", is this what you mean? Is this how far your dream can go? I'm sorry, Father. I'm really sorry. Hey, hey, right now. can you hear them say anything? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can't hear you. Can't hear you. Why? Baek Hee, look... This is the gift given by the director. Oh my God. Someone gave us so many abalones [an expensive seafood]. It is not New Year's celebration, nor is it Lunar New Year's Eve? Why would someone give us this present? We have to return all of this. Why? Why should we return this excellent present? If we put this in the freezer, we can eat this for three months. Mom. Please, I beg you not to accept this. Please return it. Baek Hee. Baek Hee. Look. I'm wearing your underwear. Ah, this is no fun. If you keep acting like this, then it's game over. So you think that your life has already hit rock bottom? You feel like in the whole world, only you are experiencing all the pain and suffering? Too noisy! Let me rest. Let's see. Whose life is worse...? You said before that you do not have a mother. I don't have a father. Looks like we're even, right? I told you to stop. You've debuted as a singer, and becoming number one. But I've not even made my debut. Do you feel my pain? The unfairness of it all? Finally, he hears me. By hitting someone, you've become a gangster, Public Enemy No. 1. I'm telling you to stop right now. Why? You still think you're in more pain than me? I still have a trump card. My hearing is damaged. What? When I experience the symptoms of tinnitus, I cannot hear any sound. I go deaf. On the showcase stage. It wasn't because of stage fright. How about it? I'm experiencing problems just like you. We're both suffering. But I am struggling and fighting as hard as I can. Even if I don't have perfect pitch, I must try to obtain it. And strive to continue to sing. Do you know why? Because I must defeat you. Defeat me? That's right. I will become someone who no one dares to pity, Someone who is able to fight man to man for the prize. Are you talking about Hye Mi? This kid is really smart. Overcome your depression and escape the darkness. I won't wait for long. Come, have a look 5:00 pm Vocal exercise room, Singing class examination. Oh Julie, I gotta go now. Yeah, I have a test.

It as huge intersection and we are all looking out the window like oh! So you ready? Yes! Oh, my god. Your focus is just like this and everything just blacks out And it is just a runway from there on. And you strut it. I saw her like a block away. She was taking off her coat and i was like oh, my gosh, she looks so pleasant. I'm remembering like timing. Timing. You have to go there and go back before the light turns green. She did keep her pace. Needs a little more bump in the grind. I want to see a girl seriously do some new york jaywalking. It was kind of sill will. We had to go into the 45-Degree weather and cross this damn, New york busy street. Your beauty should be able to stop traffic! People immediately start looking at me like what is the matter with this crazy woman And i'm loving it because that means attention! I notice a girl giving a weird face on the street. Like see one of these and one of like. I think those girls need to put some clothes on. It is like 20 degrees outside. Too cold. If there is one thing to remember, timing is everything. See ya! Bye. Tyra mail! All right. Tomorrow you will really need to be in the swing of things. Love, tyra. We are going to get to model on the swings. Alasia is really getting on my nerves. Shut the up for one second, please. Surrogate's courthouse lower manhattan The runway. Oh, my gosh! Hey, girls. Today is your first runway challenge. Girls meet rachel. Not only is she beautiful, but also very talented and she has dressed some of the red carpet's hottest stars And even the first lady herself, michelle obama. To be walking in a rachel fashion show is what a ton of Models dream of and never get to do. Hi, ladies. Tonight you will be wearing my 2010 spring designs. The girl who we think walks the best will get to keep the garment. Oh, my gosh! Don't get so excited now. This is a challenge and you girls have to walk through these pendulums. Oh, my god! With perfect timing. If not, you just may get knocked. My first reactionx ** You girls have to walk through these pendulums. Oh, my good! Everyone is in shock. Everyone in their mind. I'm going to get hit and thrown off the runway. You have to time it perfectly. I don't think all these girls are ready for it but i am so we'll see. We have to go down 30 something steps in like tiny hill legals and a tight dress But turns out that that was the least of my worries. The pendulum hits me and startles me so my main focus is keep going and pose and i know that i recovered well. Considering that i have a skin tight dress i knew i had to make my face and body Stronger because i had to walk slower which gave them more time to look at me. So it is very strategic. Very elegant.Very elegant. I was so embarrassed thinking oh, man, i messed it up, i blew it! I looked at that pendulum and i was like please. I was so in the moment. I love the music because the music made me feel like a dare devil. ** My walk needs work but i think i did a really good job. You can't really have a strategy for something you haven't dealt with before. You just have to try not to get hit. I realized that i'm not going At the right pace so for the first one i had to stutter my Steps but at least i didn't fall or slip. I actually wasn't nervous. I tend to get too excited to get nervous. My strut, i think it is sexy And i think it is classy and i think it is powerful. I'm excited to finally get some recognition. I think miss j was pretty impressed. When i first fell, i was horrified but the Competitiveness was just rushing through me like oh, my god, You idiot, get up, pull yourself together, suck it up. I think i should have just take and breath and relaxed a little bit up there. Instead i was like oh, my god, make it fierce and do something And distract them so i think i did that in my face. Mad. She's mad. ** She fell twice! I was like oh, my gosh! She got hit off the runway. Are you okay? You recovered well. You got up. 'M really competitive and i let things really get to me and that is something i never saw happening to myself. ** Pefect So when you gave that top model tumble your ** You started marching but it wasn't strong and powerful. Models fall all the time. Get up and keep going and sell the pose. Alasia, you need to take a strong elegant step. Your face is insane. Loved it. You're getting better. Brenda? I loved how you wore the dress. Fits you to a tee and i thought you made the dress look beautiful. ** The more you walk the better you get. I love the dress on you so i'm quite happy. ** Loosen up a little bit. Your body is not there yet and it completely throws you off. Naduah, this girl has face. Pop our lips out like that is your safety. Relax and smile. When you are effortless your type of beauty comes through and shines that way. So the winner of this challenge is -- Brenda. I couldn't have asked for much more. I'm so excited. I have the most gorgeous dress! So i tonight nowhere i'm going wear it but. There is a girl who was first pictured the other night at panel. Ms. Jessica, you get to keep your outfit as well. Thank you, ladies. Good night. I'm all out with that now! Alasia. ** What? You need to check that. ** I ain't going to let nobody speak to me like that for no reason. You ain't supposed to - - You don't tell me to shut the [ bleep ] up. Come down. ** Stop talking to me. You startd that stuff with me. You are acting like a real bitch right now. Tonight throw stuff. Okay, that's enough. You done lost your mind. Oh, i lost my mind? Stop talking to me. Be quiet. Quit it. Quit if. Cut it out. I may be young but that don't give no one no initiative to say something to me. I hate snapping on people. ** If i wanted to hit you with that i would hit you with it Because i was two feet away from you. I would be happy living my life and instead i chose to be in this crazy house. Do not piss me off because i'm going to go off tonight. ** I'm not in the mood for her little bitch attitude. Seriously. I'm not going to let her ruin my focus in ** ** ** What's going on? I have had it with all of these stupid fights. I went from having absolutely no drama in my life, being poor As hell but still being happy to this. I don't even feel like i'm myself. For my sanity, i'm just not sure how long i can possibly uphold this. I see you on the verge of just like breaking. I don't want you to tear apart who you are for something -- This isn't worth it to me. It's not. I do like having her here but i think if she doesn't want to be here she doesn't need to Tyra mail! Make your mark before you disappear. Love, tyra! Magic. We are going to get down to the end of the runway and disappear. We pull up to this place in brooklyn and i'm thinking this Is some hood stuff, i don't want to be here, i'm scared. ** Today we are going to do your first beauty shot nice And tight with manhattan in the background. We are in new york city. We are going to do a shot that is brenda abouts cool new fragrance. ** Give me a beauty fragrance pose. And this is the fragrance. Looks what starts to happen, it starts to fade. But you going to deal with wind, rain, Literally, you have to make it look like they are not affecting you at all. What we have to do is spray this perfume on us and before It disappears while water is hitting us and air is hitting Us look as beautiful as possible to get the perfect shot. Get down to hair and makeup. We will see you guys in a bit. We are going to be freezing. ** ** ** I don't have any - - That was my first time on the runway ever. Ever. Hello, ladies. How are you doing? As long as you give me that kind of energy on set today. This is brian and he is your photographer. He did the shoot out on ellis island and did the attack of the 54 women's shoe. Yes. Let's knock it oust the box and get something amazing. All right. Wind and rain. ** Don't hyper ventilate, girl. Oh, my gosh, i think i got water in my brain because it was like. Model. Don't look cold, look pretty. Lose those hands. Is that sexy! Oh, my god that looks crazy. I was in the bottom two last time so i was like need to get it together, girl. Is that better? Ish. She needs to stop analyzing and retain information. This was a little better than last week. Now, get warm. Ok, thank you. ** We are doing like a black blue lip. ** She has been eating tar. Open up the camera. ** I love the use of the fabric. Very pretty. Last frame. Going into photo shoot i'm just like all right, i need this. I fell down the stairs and off Of a runway, i have to do so Well. Remove that right hand. It looks like a claw. Right at the beginning of alexandra's shoot she starts giving me vogue, vogue, vogue. We are not selling nail polish. You are covering up all the blue. Now, it's gone. Spray it again. Gorgeous. I love the hair. It is almost like cindy crawford is on set. Turn your body. Usually when you throw a cat in the water you just went like this. You don't have to smile necessarily but that is good. I love that semi profile one. Pretty. Last frame. There you go. They are always fixing the makeup after they do it. ** Naduah thinks naduah knows too much. Have them do it. If they want your hair darker they will do it. You are here to learn, not here to walk in and say here i am, i know everything. Everyone is losing their minds. I felt that sometimes the girls get uncomfortable around mere. That is okay with me. A lot of people aren't as comfortable as i am so it is going to be thought of as arrogance. Here is trouble. Here is the thing. Last week i probably expected most from you so when we got on Set and started working i was disappointed probably because i expected more. Go back to the basics and don't overthink it. Be careful putting your hands here because it looks like just fingers in the shot. This is not pretty at all. Naduah has to not be afraid of erring on the side of simplicity. When she would turn into the elements she would fight with ? Her mouth and it looked really awkward like kind of like a blowup doll. Last frame. Change up your hands a little. Good. Loving the body. Could use more out of your eyes. Try not to be too squinty in the water. Don't hide the fragrance. Relax your shoulders. Don't look cold. Give me your face off this way just a touch. Brenda was like stuttering. She she was totally thrown. Try and keep your eyes open. Beautiful. Last frame. There you go. Water, wind. That's great. See if we can get some softer almost a little serene. Great. That's gorgeous! We would make madonna blush! Beautiful. Beautiful. Gorgeous. Lord, raina was my favorite of the day. ** Probably the only girl who could nail straight on to camera. All right, wind and water. Let's go. Okay. Let's stop for a second. I can feel my contacts moving in my eyeballs and it hurt a lot. I couldn't breathe. You got five more frames. Pose.O Don't have to look so cold. I wanted to get it over with because i was so uncomfortable. Last frame. Okay. That's a wrap. I wonder who's going to get the nicest photo this time? I get the feeling it is not going to be me because they are going to keep working me. I'm not at all nervous about panel. I'm going to get one great shot in there. For all my faults i really do think i have something great going. I feel it went well. I'm not afraid of being kicked off. ** Tomorrow you will meet with the judges, only 11 will continue on in the hope of Becoming "america's next top model." Raina, i never asked you, how did your shoot go? I just, i couldn't breathe or see. Today i don't care. Maybe they do want it more. Maybe they are willing to give up their whole lives just for this then that's fine. But i'm willing to give up my sanity and my happiness for this. Alasia, who do you think is going home tomorrow? Everybody probably thinks i was going home. ** I was in the bottom two **. I pray to god that the last ** ** Well, hello, ladies. Hello. The prices the first a contract with one of the top Modeling management companies in the entire world, wilhelmina models. A six-Page spread and cover of "seventeen" magazine and $100,000 contract with cover girl cosmetics. Let's talk about these judges. Mr. Nigel barker. Noted fashion photographer. Andre leon talley, a leader and one of the most influencial people in the entire fashion industry. And our guest judge is rachel roy. You all know a little something about her. And she is my good luck charm because i won an emmy in her dress. Let's get start So who is first? Alasia. Come on down, alasia. What do you think about the outfit? Dreckitude. What is dreckitude? **? ** I like this picture of you. A little bit of attitude in it. For me the picture is dramatic and i could see if in A double-Page spread in a high fashion magazine. You created our own rag time. I can't see much in your eyes and that worries me and i ** See that kind of long drool coming off your chin. ** Thank you, alasia. ** You have a beautiful profile **. I notice your profile and i thought it was beautiful and here again i would buy that. It i would buy something from her and it isn't even my color. ** Next up is ren? What are you thinking? It was tough. I had my contacts in and i was cold and i couldn't breathe right. ** You look like you have a cold, ren. This is the sort of picture that sells h 1 n 1 vaccine. You have to fight through the discomfort. On the contact lenses, take them out and go blind. ** Next up is krista. This is stunning. ** I feel this is a wonderful photograph. ** I can say that is just joyous to see that view come through. What i love about this is the fact that you have done the opposite of what you think. Water in your eyes you would think you would squint and that is when it becomes interesting. You create fantasy when you do something like that. Thank you. Next up is naduah. Hi. Let's see your best shot. ** There is a drama but a stereo typical kind of drama. It doesn't have the true magic. I don't feel there was any thought behind this. Last week i thought your picture looked like an add and this looks like an ad. Get past the exaggerated advertisement and one thing you need to do right now. What? You got so much makeup on you just drew an eyebrow on that we took off and you have eyeliner. Because it is patchy. That is better than what you have on now. ** Powder and t eyeliner. Go on back. Ok. Up next is tatianna. Gorgeous. I love it. I can't take my eyes off of your face. It is perfection. There is a vulnerability in your body and expression of fragility. It is romantic and i think it is beautiful. ** Up next is brenda. Challenge winner. Let's see your best shot. This does nothing **. Flat. ** Next. It is funny because in person you look fresh and edgy and strong. But when you are side lit it adds so many years on you that you do not have. Remember, follow it. ** Okay? Thank you. Thank you, guys. Jessica. Let's see your shot. It's all right. It's okay. What is saving you is the parachute. Youareso youngand it appears you have good energy And i'm not getting any of that from the shot and you never Want the clothing to be the best part of the photo. You still want to be the best part of the photo. Thank you, jessica. Thank you. Up next is angelea. This does nothing for me. I don't like the hair and the face, it as mess. One thing to do to make it come alive. Open your lips. Open your mouth. Breathe out. It will make it a little more sexy and a little more edgy. Thank you, angelea. Up next **. As a shod it works. It is a perfume ad, i don't get it. ** I heard something happened at fashion show. You fell? Yes. Ok. You got back up. I got back up and turned around and then i fell off the stage. Why are you crying? I just don't want to go home. I mean i can't help that. On the runway we could see your anger and sadness and you need to keep that on the inside. Models fall all the time. It is how you react afterwards. Thank you very much. Up next is simone. It is like she is hearing something. Like she was saying listen. I like your body language. The great thing is the emotion isn't just in your face. I think you express yourself in a way you think you have to be a certain way. You should relax and we haven't seen the real you yet. Thank you.

Tatianna. ** Looks so much younger than she is. She did a great job. Brenda? Biv p the fact that brenda was the winner on the runway I'm worried because one of the things she won was being a model on my website which means it is all photos. She can take a beautiful picture. Just this one i don't even know who this is. Jessica. ** I want to be excited. Astonish me. Astonish? What is astonish? I want to be astonished. Angelea. ** You didn't like this but i like it. There is a delicateness. She delivered a feminine soft shot and in person she is like. Alexandra. So modeling 101. If this was a manicure add that is the one time you could get away with doing that. I think she could learn. Simone. She is one of those pretty girls that has been told all her life whose pretty she is And is not willing to work hard enough. ** **** shake her. Raina. ? I love it. ** Almost seems like an ad for men's perfume like the perfume denigel anslee. ** ** i feel she is jutting chin. Sometimes a great jutting chin is needed. Reminds me of madonna. She is giving us madonna as a model. Alasia? She doesn't stand out in the photo and didn't out on the run way. I like this picture. Looks like she was about to ** ** The smell of whupass.

I will call one name only and the girl that i do not call must immediately return to your Apartment here in new york city, pack your bags and go home. Naduah, you stand before me because the judges see such edge, They see something that is so different, so out of the box. But when they debate and look at your photos they feel that your posing and techniques are So classic that it makes this edge almost a waste. And then we have ren. Ren, edgy, cool, interesting. Amazing photo last week. But this week one of the judges said that your photo looks like an ad for a swine flu vaccination. And that is scary because it means that you are unpredictable. So who stays in this competition? Ren. You have to fight through the elements. And from the looks of our arms, you know about pain and you know about discomfort. So no excuse for you. Congratulations. Thank you. You are still in the running towards becoming "america's next top model." Thank you. Naduah, a tip. Even how you look today. So beautiful. So classic. But it is not what sells in the industry. You decided to have edge. You came into the competition with this amazing shaved head. You can't water it down with classic posing. It's patriotic aand nice, it is kind of a contradiction that these folks feel doesn't work. Good lye. I really feel like the judge dos not give me the opportunity that i deserve. I had experience and just a passion in general that it is surpriseing that they didn't see more in me. I feel insultd that some of the girls for not having more of a Desire like i do and that they are still here and i am not. And so walking out of this experience the only thing i Will do is tin, not only continue, but flourish. when i dreamed up "america's next top model" all those years ago, back when mr. jay still had black hair, i did not imagine that it would become a worldwide phenomenon, seen in almost 150 countries. and over 17 countries have created their own version of "america's next top model." heidi klum hosts our german version, and canada, where our very own jay manuel is the host. now it's time for cycle 14 of "america's next top model"... come here. and we have plenty of tricks up our couture sleeves. who will cry at the makeovers? i love my hair. i just don't feel like myself. i look like a boy. cut her hair. no. wait. wait, wait, wait, wait. which girl will have the fiercest walk? look at her working it. what photo shoot will push the girls to their breaking point? ooh, jesus, jesus. ooh, it's tickling up under my arm. and one of the most influential people in the fashion world has joined my judging panel. 32 unique long-legged beauties have come to los angeles to begin this competition, but only one will become... america's next top model! -==ÆÆÀÃÐÜÀÖÔ°ÇãÇé·îÏ×==- ±3⁄4×ÖÄ"1⁄2ö1©Ñ§Ï°1⁄2"Á÷£¬ÑÏ1⁄2ûÓÃÓÚÉÌÒ�ÓÃÍ3⁄4 we arrive to l.a. we drive out to the universal sheraton. we know at some moment we're probably gonna see tyra. i'm anslee. i'm from dacula, georgia, and i'm here for the semifinals of "america's next top model." what is up, baby?

i have a different look. because i am biracial, i can pass as black. i can pass as white. whatever you want me to be, i am. now you walk like you gonna whoop somebody's ass. so where is everyone from? i'm from st. louis. i sat back and talked to the girls. every girl has a totally different personality. did you guys see, um, angelea? is she here? no. she's back. that girl seems like... the kind of girl i would really avoid. when i saw angelea here, i was kinda scared that she was gonna end up killing me or just making me cry and, like, stealing my lunch money. what i've noticed, watching the show from 13th season and down, the mean girl never wins. so we're back again, and i'm actually kind of interested to see how these girls are gonna present themselves, 'cause they've had 13 other cycles to watch this competition unfold. this is gonna be tough. so if you're boring, don't show up. what's up, y'all? hi. thank you. oh, my god. thank you. i swear, i-ooh. i am so grateful and i am so happy that, like, you believe in me. tell us what was going on at that time. i was messing with this guy, so i, like, had that... like that mad attitude, you know what i'm sayin'? when i got home, the first thing i did, i called up a counselor. i already notice a huge change-the nails. yes, i got rid of the nails. look at them damn nails. oh, my goodness. i'm back. i'm ready. i know what i gotta do. i'm doing it. i swear, i want it. like, i know i'll be looking at them ads, like the prada. i know, like, the sky-high boots- i know that's in with the miniskirt. i know-like, i know my stuff. like, iris strubegger- i wanna be like her. that girl got the valentino campaign and the gi-venchy campaign in the same magazine. and the what campaign?

my grandmother, but she's-she was old, so it was expected. but, uh, my mom never had to work a day in her life. um, i've never had to work a day in my life. now you have a very famous godmother. cybill shepherd's my godmother, and she was the one who was like, you need to get out there and model, and i was like, okay. a lot of girls are here, and they're like, i don't have anywhere else to go. i don't have a house. i don't have anywhere to live. i don't have any money. i have $2 to my name. i can just ask my mom for money if i need money. i'm not here for the money. i'm here to have this career and to go after modeling. hi. my name is simone. i'm 19, i'm from lenexa, kansas, and i'm so psyched to be here. are you really? i'm so excited. you have no idea. i'm a sophomore at duke university, but my real passion is modeling. i've always been kind of an overachiever at school. my two life goals are to be, like, victoria's secret model or hillary clinton. i know that you don't feel super accepted in-in a certain community. i could represent, like, educated black women, but for some reason, a lot of other black women don't seem to, like, want to befriend me. so you joined a sorority? i did. i joined delta gamma. i'm the only black girl out of, like, 75. i've gotten that i act like a white girl a lot. like, i always use the term "oreo." that was my name. i mean, this is just who i am, the way i was raised. obviously, this must be how my parents talk, so i don't plan to change. well, it's, like, i don't know. it's, like, i don't think i really see a model. i love her. if you don't hear her, i could see- no, seriously, she's a model. i'm a 2-time national champion. i play volleyball at my school back in minnesota, and we won the national championship last year and the year before. when i was younger, i was just the tallest girl always. and i had these huge buckteeth. i was very shy, had no friends. you're from texas, aren't you? n-no. i'm from arkansas. arkansas. okay. i have a little boy. he's 1. his name is roman. lord, have mercy. you are married? you look like you in high school. i'm from conway, arkansas, and so, you know, we say "y'all" and we like sweet tea. there's two things that i absolutely love in this world, and that's my family and that's this industry. hello! i am jessica. i am from arkansas and i'm 18 years old. i understand that you conceived a child the first time that you had... sex? and i have no idea how it happened. and apparently, the doctor said i'm very fertile. okay, so you're 16 years old, and then you met this boy. how old was he? 22. we met at church, ironically. and we were both on leadership. i married at 16 years old and i had a baby at 17. my parents disapproved of it completely. and i'm still trying to forgive, uh, our church, because they don't accept us there because of the way we chose to do things. and so i kind of hold a grudge still against them. i do think there could be something a little edgy in her. when she posed, i believed it. of course, jay, there's something edgy in her. she got knocked up on the first date. of course there's something edgy. hi, guys! you're like a rocker/cheerleader girl. i'm raina. i am 22 years old and i am from minnetonka, minnesota. you have super beautiful eyes. i'm just mesmerized. i just love the shape. i love that, like, hooded lid. as i grew up, i was not a pretty kid at all. i was, you know, super pasty white. i had this huge unibrow- extremely attractive, i know. i had no friends. i was so shy. i was in this little bubble, and now i'm just like, aah! it wasn't until my senior year in high school where i broke out of my shell and i, like, just became me. i-i love her look. i'm so in love with her face. that face is slammin'. hi, everyone. you're happy and blue and red. my name is brenda, i'm 23 and i'm from houston, texas. i was adopted, and i got two fabulous parents. and then you met your biological dad how? this year, i finally decided to try to search for him and find him. my boyfriend- he's a houston police officer, so with his help, it was real easy to find my dad, 'cause he's a convicted felon. we knocked on the door. i was like, "hi. i think i'm your daughter." it just didn't go so well. he just denied. he denied you? yeah. but i'm happy i did it for myself. i needed closure. well, we're glad that you're here. now you have something in common with another girl here- the first time you had... the first time i ever had sex- boom! pregnant at 18. yes, i've had a baby. yes, i have stretch marks. but you can still, like, be on top, and you just have to work hard. how y'all doin'? you is off the ch- y'all is off the chain. oh, my gosh. you wearing all the chains. you like it? you like it? i'm kinda- i didn't expect this out of you. are you the church girl or are you the biker chick? i'm a little bit of both. i'm not gon' say i grew up in the 'hood, but i grew up in the 'hood. i used to be bad. i used to be a rebel. i used to be with boys all the time. i used to be horrible. but finding christ and getting saved helped me. she has that something about the way she moves her derriere. it's kind of pole dancer-ish. "i have been crucified through christ and i no longer live, but christ lives in me." that is galatians 20. 20. ooh, i gotta look that up. naughty girl. i didn't tell my teachers that i was gonna be here. i told them i was leaving for family matters, you know? but i did get all my makeup work. my teachers are gonna freak out when they finally find out that this is what i was doing. like, "alasia, why didn't you tell us?" what made you cry so much when you first met tyra? when you first met tyra. i love tyra. i'm-that-that girl is just off the chain. why would you cry if you love her? i felt like you took the focus off her. you all on the floor, "aah! tyra!" tyra's like, yeah. alasia-i think she has a character, and she, like, flips the switch or something. it's like, flip the switch-i'm crazy, and flip the switch- i'm normal. that's her insecurities kicking in, so i'm not worried about her. krista does not scare me. i see what she's trying to do. sometimes guilty people will point a finger at you, but you got three fingers pointing for. three fingers pointing back at you. she's not gonna intimidate me, 'cause i can break her little skinny behind into two. i'm-a get real ugly with her. you look like a barbie that comes with the room. i've been wanting to be in this competition since it started. i'm hungry. i'm 24. in the modeling industry, they-they stop you somewhere around 25. they think that's your peak age. it's my last chance. so tell me-you're open to dating outside of your race. yeah. but you're afraid of something? i don't wanna date white guys because i'm kinda nervous. it makes me scared to see a pink penis. it makes me think of raw meat or something. i know! i know! i know! it makes you think of raw meat? yes! like, raw, pink meat. like hamburger meat? looking good is everything to me. every time i walk out the door- i don't even go to the grocery store looking busted. i have heels on every day. that's all i own. i have no tennis shoes. who owns tennis shoes? it's-it's all about presentation. she walked in the room, and i thought-love her, want her in this competition. yes, the neck, great skin. there's been a lot of exquisite skin so far. my name is aimee. i'm 21 years old and i'm from houston. and you're just so sweet. and whimsical. yeah, that's what my friends told me. they're like, "you're whimsical." why do you talk like you're on broadway? i feel like i'm in an "alice in wonderland" world, and you're gonna tell a story. no, i kind of sing when i talk, i guess. yes, you do? b i study classical music, so i do a lot of opera arias and art songs. we'll do a musical. i met a girl named aimee. she walked into "america's next top model" casting and sang. my name is aimee b and why do you want ae b to model? f b because i think it would be a lovely thing to do? b i believe i only have one chance to live, and. for me, modeling is an art form, like singing, like painting, i don't know, like all creative arts. hey. how are you guys doing today? my name's tatianna. i'm 21 and i'm from ewa beach, oahu, of hawaii. so i understand you volunteer and do something quite interesting. i'm actually a volunteer mortician. i do embalming and cremation. what you do is inject the formaldehyde and tighten the body. if they don't do that, they want cremation. send it to the oven, get the ashes, give it to the family. and if you are an organ donor, you just get filled with sawdust. filled with sawdust. sawdust. yes. actually, when i was in tenth grade, my brother was diagnosed with h.i.v. and so this is what began my real path towards science, because i've always wanted to contribute to the research towards h.i.v. but why would you then come to the competition then if you had this. yeah, because i want to check out this reality. like, i've been in the science world for so long. we're really not interested in finding people who want to just "check it out." i really love glamour. i've always wanted something glamorous. i've always wanted something- people to identify me with something other than a lab coat. i don't know if modeling is a passion or just "i just want to get out of the lab." i love drag queens. i go to this store that sells, like, the drag makeup and, like, the hair. i didn't buy this from them, but. what do they mean when they say "drag"? "drag," like drag queen. they're drag queens. drag queens are very sparkly and huge hair. just, like, glamorous. we have chaka khan, diana ross, beyonc? i am a plus size model. i love fashion. i love glamour. i love anything that's sparkly and glitz. what is this place called "glamazonia"? planet glamazonia is in the glamazonian galaxy. and it's a planet that i created. it's all from my imagination. and it's a planet filled with very tall, beautiful women. and every year, once a year, there's a male sacrifice that's brang to the colony to procreate. you are the man that we are sacrificing. why do i have to be sacrificed? because we need to procreate with you. what do we do when we sacrifice her men? why am i petrified? lay down. lay down? in my suit? tyra banks! we need male sperm. straddle. okay, i don't know how that's gonna work. oh, my god! was that good for you? that was fantastic. oh, okay. so who are you? what is your name? i'm naduah. naduah? you are gorgeous. oh, my gosh. if i was a lesbian, i would be in love with you. i think naduah would be my biggest competition, because she got the little- bald, little shaved, looking real european thing going on. what accent do you even have? it's like british slash. no one's really sure where my accent is from. here's the thing. my father is european. my mother is spanish and mexican. we traveled a lot. i was-i was born and raised into a cult, a religious cult, which is probably the reason why i'm no longer religious. they were very, um, into sex, you know? it's what they used to get what they wanted. so most of the children i know who grew up there were sexually molested. there were times i didn't even see my parents. i lived in a-in a home with about a hundred other children. so you grow up having this low self-esteem. personally, i had no confidence till about three years ago. oh, my gosh. that's crazy. oh, my god! tyra banks! okay, my name is naduah. i'm 22 years old, born and raised in cancÚN, mexico, but now in san diego, california. and what is in your hand? oh, you painted it. i drew it. that is beautiful. i'm going to frame that. thank you. so i know that you had a- a very difficult childhood. i was born into a cult, like a military. sometimes you have to do very aggressive chores, for a child, like cleaning a floor with a toothbrush or if you don't sit up straight, they put, like, a stick behind your back, and, like, attach your arms to it- things like that. you know, i finally came to my senses, realized that there were other options, and i decided to make a name for myself, and i have. and i know that's why i'm here, 'cause i'm strong. it was a very hard childhood, and i think that's what ignited the fire that helped me leave this lifestyle. she's been through a lot. and she's-she's really strong. but you hear it in her voice, though, 'cause she wanted to break, she wanted to cry. but i think sometimes it's good to cry. oh, my gosh! hi! my name is nida, i'm 18 years old and i'm from east bernard, texas. you're originally from? pakistan. okay. oh, i love it. pakistan. i hear your mother's overprotective of you. if your mother was in this room right now, what would she be saying? "nida, this is just right opportunity for you. short skirts not for you." growing up in a pakistani family, i had a lot of restrictions. it's kinda not culturally accepted to use your, like, sex appeal to make money. so this is, like, a really big opportunity for me to show other pakistani girls that you know, i'm here, and if i can do this, you can, too. everybody wanna get in the house. but we're gonna, for sure, have one plus size, two blacks, two latinos, two whites. you are in the same category. that's why i haven't been saying too much to you, because i do believe you are my competition. i think angelea is my biggest competition. because we are biracial, we resemble each other. since i'm younger, i have more of a chance of make it into the industry. when i noticed- was that because we- we mixed or. yeah, 'cause we, like draw- our faces draw attention, like you don't know what we are. i'm still angelea, and i think that i am just. just that bitch. it's hard. it's like either we're both gonna make it, or one of us is gonna make it. gabrielle is. i don't think she's competition. you guys look mad gorgeous. like, mr.jay, you look beautiful. your nationality is. my mom is german, and my dad's black. because of my father, like, i have. it's okay. i've never had a stable, black father figure in my life, and so it's just- my trust is low when it comes to that. so who do you date? i don't date. nobody? i'm-i'm here for my career. i know that you-you said that you feel like an outcast sometimes. what does that mean? i used to be insecure about my race. when i was with my dad, people would be like, is that your dad? or, like, they used to- like, my little sister, she looks like pocahontas- long, black hair. they're like, "is she adopted?" don't ask me that stupid question. it's hard sometimes. people make ignorant remarks against, like, your parents- things like that. "i think white people should be with white people. black people with black people." people are people. there's a girl here that you remind me of-angelea. wasn't she here before? do you see her as your competition here? yeah. i think she's pretty. sometimes she does come off as, like, cocky. if we both make it, i don't care. i'm whooping her ass- photo-wise, runway-wise. i'm-i have it. i do believe. ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause. how are y'all? i'm alexandra. i'm 21, and i'm from kerrville, texas. i am plus size. your body is gorgeous. thank you. i got a great fanny. you do have a great fanny. i do. it's large. it's in charge. you're a girlie tomboy. people have told me i am the girliest tomboy they've ever met. i fly-fish, i snowboard, i wakeboard, surf. but, you know, i do- i have a huge girlie side. i have a high heel collection that will make most girls cry. i've never thought of myself as bigger than any other girl. almost everyone i know is, like, a zero. like a lot of my friends- they wear zero jeans. you know, i don't. i wear 10s. they complain more about their bodies than i do. hello, y'all. hello. how are you? i am anslee, i'm 23 years old, and i'm from dacula, georgia. dick-ula? dacula. he got excited for a second. okay. i'm recently married. we have a 21/2 year old together. i'm a mom. i'm 23 years old, and i still got it, 'cause i'm here. tell me about modeling, why you wanna be a model. you put me in front of a camera, and you see parts of me that come out. camera's there. go. okay. the pi-oh, okay. what was that? it's me. if you can't strut your stuff and show people who you are, what-what are you? you're good for nothin'. hi. hello. i'm danielle, and i'm 19. and you're pierced. yes. and tatted. yeah, and tattoos. how would i do a cosmetic ad? where i come from, a lot of people look at you like. you know, they look at me funny. like, i'm not gonna stab you. okay, tell us why you wanna be a model. so far, all the girls you've seen- they don't look like me, you know? i think you're actually quite classically beautiful. with holes and piercings and tattoos. i can do classic. i can do edgy. i can do more modern. i'm very versatile. i love her accent. thank you. i love her. i don't know how many times i gotta say that. i know. i like danielle and i like hallie, but when we all got to sit down at the tables and actually get to know each other and talk to each other, they sat at a table with each other, by themselves. but that just goes to show that, you know, some people have it, some people don't. see, we southern girls- we're classy enough to know that it's not kosher to, like, go and be like, hey, i'm gonna sing and dance and shake my ass. a ton of the other girls just don't seem like they really deserve to be here. who do you think is going at this table? the girl with the kooky red hair, alasia, yeah. that plus size white girl- i don't like her. i'm pretty positive you and me are definitely gonna make- i don't know i'm so confident about this. i am intimidated being here. and a lot of these girls are way more outgoing than i am- ripping off wigs and doing all this crazy stuff. and i'm just like, okay. my confidence isn't the highest, so i'm scared. let's start our own table with, like, a table of chill, mellow, laid-back, like, table. honestly, that would just be me and you. oh, my god. i think it's gonna be an elimination. i'm so nervous. because you just never know. we had the opportunity to go through all of your profiles. but. 12 of you have been declined. tyra's got a lot of people in her network, and she doesn't have room for everybody. i'm not scared. i'm not intimidated. but i don't want to go home, though. there are all these touch panels behind us. click the "status" button, and if you are still pending final confirmation, a big "pending" stamp will be on the screen. those of you who are pending final confirmation, you will have a chance at becoming a part of the "top model" network. but those of you who don't, it's not my fault. oh, no. all right, i just think they can go. i'm done. oh, my god! tyra picked me! yes! okay, i just. okay, i gotta slap myself! i cannot believe this right now! oh, my god! yay! yay! i got declined. i was a little shocked. but, you know, everything happens for a reason. i can't even breathe right now. i just wish i could, like, say something to tyra, just, like, for two seconds. and just be.

To kill Use it for that when you have to do so Time remaining 50 mins What are your feelings towards the police? I really don't think they're too different from anybody else Pigs are pigs. I mean... Pigs have always been pigs The street-cleaners of the public conscience They're just like hired killers These people have been sent out unarmed Unarmed? I don't think Jack did anything to them This is going to be the first revolution in history when the pigs were in the upper class I think they're in the same boat as the people we left back at the house They have a point of view and they're willing to use any means to back it up They're doing a job. They're just taking orders They're working. They're getting paid for what they do Can you tell us what happened here? What happened is obvious.

No doubt about it whatsoever Each is thinking that that could have been him It undoubtedly would have been There's no doubt that it'll cause more antagonism ...and I think antagonism is a very mild word on the part of the men towards these individuals We have a specific plan of action in such circumstances and as soon as the National Guard, who found the body, informed me that this had taken place those measures went into effect Do you feel the country is on the brink of fratricide? It's already been happening for some time Did they take any weapons from the deputy? They have his patrol car They have a 357 Magnum They have a Remington 12-gauge Wingmaster shotgun at least 50 rounds of ammunition They have his billy-club They also took his shoes They are armed and dangerous They have a shotgun that's the most dangerous that I can imagine We will use force and not take any chances They've killed once. I don't like to lose men Did you know the deputy that was killed? I didn't know him that well It's not about a personal vendetta We're doing this for the people who pay the taxes The thing that appalls me is that it seems to be understood It doesn't have to happen this way If we can somehow create a change of spirit. It doesn't have to happen But it is - Have you ever killed a man? - Yes, I have What did you feel about that at the time? No feeling at all Do you think you'll have to resort to violence? No. I hadn't thought about violence at all I don't think there'll be any need That's what we're working against But it just seems like there's no other way to defend ourselves Violence might be necessary. Yes I can't see the good in fighting back If they kill me, what difference would my politics make? I would be dead You quit your job and you don't like to work for others I can understand that.

I don't have to be insulted by this little guttersnipe In the psychiatric evaluation of the prisoner, these songs do show a neurotic and schizophrenic tendency Is that your opinion, dummy? Here's what I'm interested in You came from a wealthy family You had the best that this country has to offer Why do you turn against the country? My parents taught me to think ...and gave me certain values of honesty and- - To think? - That's why I'm here Tell people to throw bombs too? They taught me to think and gave me a set of moral values Nothing to do with sex, lady - What happened to the moral values? - I still have all of them What about the songs you write? Do you call those moral? A lot more moral that what you're doing sitting right there. Fuck off! Watch your language Why should I watch my language? Fuck off! Watch your language, defendant What do you think I care what you tell me to do? You're going to kill me in a little while Old man! Moral crap? You said crap! Yes. You make me say crap! - You make me very angry! - Shoot that woman! She said crap! Sit down, defendant What you're doing to the children- What I' m doing? Yes, what you're doing! You make me sick! You're a crazy girl! You ought to be locked up! Why should I be locked up? Why don't you shoot me? Because you're schizophrenic! You're cuckoo! Miss Smith, I remind you that your violent overthrow-of-the-government, financially-rewarding songs really gives you a peculiar kind of freedom... to have your love-ins, to have your pot What is your philosophy of government? What do you believe in? I would take every man that's in a uniform in another country ...and bring him back home and put him back in the world I would take every prisoner out of their cages I would feed every hungry person and take away every rich person's money I would take every person that's tired of working jobs like on the auto lines and have worked for years for nothing and never getting ahead I had to quit school because... I got so fucking paranoid because after Kent State... I realized that I had to put on a cheerleader's sweater with an I love America pin and the people who were shooting weren't even aiming I'd walk out of a classroom ...and be on my way to lunch and get killed just as easily as in the front line of a barricade in a demonstration - Do you have any children? - Yes, I have How many children? You've tried to get into the mind of some of my children They were brainwashed by watching Donna Reed and Father Knows Best By the time they listened to me, they were past their formative years - How many? - I have 3 children How would you feel if one of them died? I'd feel terrible. The course has now been in progress for 24 and a half hours Let us get back to the charges I'll read them again I have a charge to make against you I have a charge to make against you, old man! You old, sick man How many kids have you led to the slaughter? How many kids are out there? Who's getting killed by the guns that I hear? How many children have been through these tribunals? - Silence! - No! How many children have you killed? Who's dying right now? You sent those kids out there I sent those kids out there? Who's dying? Who's dead that was sitting right here? You sat here and with all the arrogance in the world- I don't have to listen to that You don't even hear me Cut it out! You're a phoney! There's no question about this girl being a definitive communist threat Each member of this group is now lacking about 2 quarts of body water I believe in destroying everything that you stand for and everything that you're trying to do I'm complaining? I have the right to complain! Defendant, sit down. Restrain the defendant You're going to put a bullet- Basically, we found ourselves in a situation where we thought we had the entire group of militants pinned down and called upon them to surrender They did not do so and you see the consequences Silence the defendant! Silence the defendant! I've got a couple of young kids. How are you going to raise them? We have at least one more running around What do you plan to do now? We have this gun We'll try to find a place in the high ground and wait for them and, if they don't come, we'll get out We know we'll get them This whole fucking game is like a revolution and we're in it If we don't get them, the desert will We've got to either win or die - Where was he hit? - In the neck I don't much care just so they're hit If we do win, we're going to wreck this fucking establishment and this fucking game They don't understand what's going on in this country They have no idea, no loyalty, no understanding and they respond with violence And the words in her songs... "Throw bombs!" "Blow up!" "Kill!" "Kill!" And who do they kill? Innocent people And she drives the kids here and says we did it Temperature 98 degrees One of the main reasons for having Punishment Park is because, with the type of crime that we have being committed today the civil and social crime we're filling up our prisons faster than we can build new facilities May we ask you what you feel about your duty on the board today? What do you feel about disciplining young people? A number of these young people remind me of a situation I had at home It was one of my own daughters For about a year we had quite a difficult time with her She didn't believe that there would be any discipline and we sort of worked that thing out May I ask you how? I kept punishing her and she kept responding until finally we worked it out quite well You've got to remember that these children are like skilled and trained, highly-bred horses They're trained to go around that track but then you've got to sort of hold them in because, if you let the reins out they'll just run around without any control at all We do get a few oddballs before this tribunal Especially that one that wouldn't kill a fly He said he'd take one of these cups and catch the fly and take it outside and let it free He's probably in 1-A now or Indochina. I wouldn't know I'd rather be in a lot more places than in the desert I have a wife and family back home There are certain things you have to do for your country but for all the abuse and just seeing these characters have no respect for this country... We sit there and try to give them a chance to have a fair say but they don't appreciate it It's a very difficult job to do But somebody has to do it We do our best What would you do if one of your children appeared before you? Oh, my God My kids wouldn't do that. They really wouldn't They've been trained differently I see a running pattern of paranoia in these youngsters This may sound funny I think there should've been more spank and less Spock ...and our youth wouldn't be what they are today These are political criminals. They are not social criminals They have to be shown that their way is wrong We cannot show them by killing them, by building gas chambers or by setting up machine-gun bunkers and covering them with bulldozers This is not the way we like to operate - What's wrong? - Fuck! Fuck! Let's get going But going where? Let's try to make it to the flag How'll we make it somewhere? We have no water! There's no water that way What would your forefathers have done, Mr Kohler if, during the revolution they were all conscientious objectors? If the majority of my forefathers were conscientious objectors it would include the people from England and they would have been acting justly towards the people in the colonies James Arthur Kohler Pacifist. Age 20 ...and they wouldn't have been over here killing the Indians Are you aware of the crisis in this country? ...of the world at large and the responsibility that we have to this crisis? What responsibility do you have as a citizen? My responsibilities as a citizen do not include killing for it I'm not going any further They want us to try and break out They want us to become violent They want us to be like them I'm not going to let them play games with me anymore! Anyone that wants to come with us, come on They want to blow your brains out They're going to kill you. Straight and simple That's what'll kill us! Things like that! Are you familiar with Saint Thomas Aquinas? Yes, I am I think he had this to say about a just war He laid down a proviso for a just war: ...that the war must be decided upon legitimate authority and, secondly, that its objective must be to vindicate justice and that, thirdly, it must be waged with a just intent This was during the 12th Century, before this present time He understood what a just war meant Can't you understand that the policy in Indochina is even justified by a 12th Century philosopher? Those provisos came from Saint Augustine originally and Saint Augustine had a fourth proviso which shows the total absurdity of considering any war just: ...that a war must be waged under the control of a loving disposition that no man is fit to inflict punishment until he has banished hate from his heart Temperature 109 degrees Distance to the US flag 27 miles Defendant, I take it from your philosophy you're opposed to slavery. Is that right? Yes, I am And the Civil War was fought to free the slaves? Speak up, will you? It wasn't fought to free the slaves and it wasn't a just war It was just war because the black people fought for freedom Would you have fought on the side of the black people? Black people haven't gained their freedom! What do you think what's happening right now is all about? We know that there are only a handful of black militants that are running the People's Army. It does not represent the community You are trying to overthrow the government... Charles Robbins member of the People' Army Age 25 Martin Luther King was opposed to your violence and you're talking about a People's Army when you're only a handful To deal with the thing of what you call black militants trying to overthrow the government we're trying to save people because the government is overthrowing itself My loyalty is to the people. People are the most important thing and people have been left out while the cats that run this country have moved and shitted all over You dwell on the black problem It's quite obvious because I'm black I've been to Washington DC and I've seen the schools and ghettos and we're trying to educate and yet you're trying to take over our programs Is that what you're trying to offer? Our own programs? The thing is we don't want to take over your programs... because we know your programs are very corrupt Do you believe you're separatist or a racist? I'm neither. I'm an internationalist You have no chance in hell going the way you're going Two surviving members of Corrective Group 637 have seized a West German sound technician as hostage We're trying to save the people In what way? Through mass education. We believe in education through example We have very functional programs. Example. Right on What kind of example are you? You're a revolutionary Your newspapers show a black militant with a gun "Shoot the pigs!" "Shoot the pigs!" I believe in this It's simple and plain When fired upon, I believe in firing back It's just a matter of staying alive It's like a game they're playing You either win or you die The pigs are running madly through our community slaughtering off our children and our women The truth in America is that America is a sick society America is full of motherfuckers who have shitted upon people Are you afraid to die? No, I'm not afraid to die. That's quite obvious Why are you leading your people into a mass hysteria? When I walk through Washington DC asking why- Hey, man, you're always in Washington DC but you ain't doing nothing in Washington DC! You're out here in California right now sitting on a committee that is supposed to be from this particular area but you spend most of your time in Washington DC How come you're not in Washington DC relating to the problem? Does that make me a pig? I don't to have to call you a pig because you know what you are Would you like me to define what a politician is? A politician is nothing but a debater All that you do is debate issues, you fat pig! You meathead! That's all that you are because you're a lying sucker! You're lying to the camera, to your mamma, to everybody! Quiet! Quiet, defendant! You ain't got no humanity in you because you're a pig! You lying punk! Restrain the defendant Shut him up! Shut him up! Gag him! Shut him up! Defence counsel... Shut him up! What seems quite clear now is that instead of trying to bring estranged and excluded Americans back into the national community the administration has chosen to accept and exploit the division within the country and to side with what it considers as the majority Instead of the politics of reconciliation ...it has chosen the politics of polarization Have you discussed what you'll do if you have to leave him? Or will you try and take him with you? We never thought about it Morning on the third day When the human body has suffered a dehydration of between 6 to 10% it experiences dizziness, difficulty in breathing decreased blood volume, indistinct speech and finally an inability to walk Distance to the US flag 23 miles I'd like to know about violence on the campus I'd like to know why you people do these things A lot of us work hard to build those schools and pay taxes And you people just come along and burn them right down Students don't burn buildings down. That's just a myth It's just a sensationalized myth brought about by the press Students don't burn buildings down and, besides, I don't advocate violence Alison Michener, radical organizer of women' unions co-founder of the National Committee Against War And Repression Age 23 It's a waste of time You try to destroy the Bank Of America try to break in a window. They can build it right up... They have the money, power. That's not the way to change things I'm glad I'm here Some of the guys have gotten pretty upset since the deputy incident I'm afraid they're going to shoot first and ask questions later Have you heard some of the men say that? They've really gotten paranoid I think that people become violent when they are deprived of their basic human needs I think that they become violent when that is their only alternative to achieving the satisfaction of those needs A major component of our democratic society which states that an individual is guaranteed the rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness The rights to life It seems paradoxical to me that a nation with such ideals and such economic power still cannot fulfill or seems unwilling to fulfill basic human needs of food, clothing and shelter The decoy seems to have worked very well It's brought them out in the open They've reached the decoy A country with this economic power and those kinds of ideals still at this point can't feed 11 million people, according to a government survey Your participation in the course is terminated Temperature 111 degrees ...still can't feed 11 million people, can't clothe those people even though they're producing those things in overabundance Now why is that? And if you have someone who can't get food stamps and who can't get on welfare and who is starving he or she can either sit there and watch his children starve or go out and fight for what he needs Stop where you are Sit down, cross your legs and keep your hands behind your head Stop where you are! Sit down where you are! Cross your legs and put your hands behind your head You're under arrest I think they can't hear you Stop where you are! Stop where you are! Stop. Sit down. Go back or I shall shoot to kill I don't think they can hear you. Just a minute Get back. There seems to be some confusion here Stop where you are! Now come on. Slow up. They can't hear you Sit down! Sit down! Sit down! Fuck! Go on! Get the gun! Dear Lord we pray for Harold Violence is inherent in this society. You don't seem to understand that You fucking bastards! Get out of here! The movement went through a long time in history and was very reluctant to make radical changes, to become violent We saw the government would only make changes when we did become violent Violent, violent, violent, violent... Yes, violence, Mr Chairman I think we should realize the dangerous extent to which- You wish the floor, Defence Counsel? - Yes, I do! Yes, I do! - Then get up We should realize the degree in which the violence of the students is now being overplayed and that of the establishment is being minimized You are trying to put radicals on trial as scapegoats for the problems of your own system It's rather appropriate that Harold was a poet There's no place for a poet in this culture It's so hard to have any hope about anything after you see how completely inhuman people can be We must draw this cross-examination to a close There was no need to do that I'm sitting here chained in the chair and you don't need to send these people you train to behave live mad dogs I have a very important part of the hearing to talk to you about... I don't think you know what's important ...the amnesty provision and I want to read it to you Your signing of a voluntary pledge of loyalty that you will not again participate in any form or manner of extra-legal or subversive political activity and that you will not again hinder State or Federal authorities in matters relating to safeguarding of the national security I am loyal to the people of this country, Your Honour or whatever your title is I am not loyal to the government because it is against the people Hands behind your head. Come out Don't shoot them! Don't shoot them! They're all right! Tell them not to shoot! Tell that fucker not to shoot! We don't have any guns! Tell that nigger to put his hands up where I can see them Fuck you! Come on! Come on! Come on! There' a camera crew here! I don't give a fuck who's there Ease up! Ease up! Put your hands behind your head Take pictures of this! They're gonna to kill us! I think there is a chance to make it through this course and I think we're going to do it We have to not lose hope and keep on going We don't have any guns Our choice is whether to submit to this self-destruction passively or violently That's the only choice I see Fucking liar! You'll shoot us in the back! Keep back. Keep back, now So you feel that, just as you feel there' a reason for going on through the course this is the same way to try and deal with what you feel is wrong with the system in America? I think that's right. Yeh I think if you play it by the rules of the people who've set up the game even though they're stacked against you that's the only way to possibly win the game Don't do that! Don't do that! Get down! You goddamn motherfucking weekend warriors! You killed them! Oh, God! Motherfuckers! You murderers! Cut! Cut! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! There' an accident! Put that fucking rock down, boy! Cut the camera! Cut the camera! I feel very little hope for us I don't see any hope either way It's simply a matter of what you believe in Either you believe in non-violence or you don't And, if you do many times there's only one path left to you and you have to take that, no matter what it means to you Now, come on. Help these people! Help these people! Help them Help them That one's dead Oh, you fuckers! You fuckers! You shitty fucking cunts! We've got one left alive, huh? Fucking idiots! We've seen this! We've seen this! We've seen this! Officer Edwards, we've seen this! I don't give a flying fuck what you've seen! This is going on NBC! We've seen this! I don't care if you take it and jam it in your ass You murdering bastards! You fucking bastards! As soon as you get through with your little hysterics... Hysterics, mate? You wait until you see yourself on TV I've been on TV before. I'm not worried Not like this you haven't Captain, should I call for the ambulances? Let the buzzards get the sons-of-bitches. And him too - They threw rocks and... - This man's shook up Leave him alone Why did you kill two people? I don't know. It was an accident - You didn't mean to kill them? - No, I didn't want to kill anyone You didn't want to kill them? No! No! No, I didn't want to kill anyone! It was an accident! Hey! Leave him alone. Leave him alone! - How old is this kid? - He's 18 What' a kid doing in the National Guard if he can't use weapons? - He's trained to use them. - Trained to use them? What do you expect with all those men throwing rocks? - You mean he' trained to kill people? - Yes, he is. To defend his country He's trained to defend his country! You mean he' trained to kill unarmed people like that? It was an accident! It was an accident. They were throwing rocks The gun just went off. I didn't know what happened What are you going to say to their parents? Come on, soldier. Let's go. Come on. Let's go President Nixon in San Clemente, CA sent a telegram for reading at the Artists' Variety show The Chief Executive told the artists: "We Americans are known throughout the world as forward-looking people" The President said the USA is a symbol of progress, of hope and of just and orderly growth B- 52 bombers hit guerilla infiltration routes along along the Cambodian border north of Saigon The afternoon of the following day This has been a session marred by continual disruptive outbursts in direct defiance of judicial authority by the defendants and defence counsel Outburst in the form of constant murmurs... This disruption of a further example of what I've been referring to Marshal, you'll restrain the prisoner if he makes any more outburst Outbursts in the form of constant murmurs and derision shouting profanity and abuse No record, no matter how skillfully transcribed... - We'll have quiet here! - Or what? ...can adequately portray the venom, sarcasm and tone of voice employed by a speaker This has been a session marked by guffaws, cheap theatrics and other affectations used by the defendants in an attempt to break up these proceedings Despite these outbursts, the proceedings have been conducted with impartiality and objectivity as called for by the extreme seriousness of the circumstances Turn him loose! These proceedings have been conducted before a nationwide TV audience in an attempt to clarify for the American people the issues at stake as an object lesson for others who may be considering the wilful and tragic path taken by the defendants Defence counsel, do you have anything to say as to why I should not proceed with the sentencing? Ladies and Gentlemen of the tribunal I would like to read you something "The streets of our country are in turmoil "The universities are filled with students rebelling and rioting "Communists are seeking to destroy our country "Russia is threatening us with her might... "...and the Republic is in danger "Yes, danger from within and without "We need law and order or our nation cannot survive" We might all be forgiven for supposing those to be the words of our President But they are not Those words were uttered in 1932 by Adolf Hitler Sieg motherfucking Heil! We know what kind of law and order followed in that country You ask if I have anything to say to show cause why sentence shouldn't be passed Other than that these are young people with all of life before them full citizens of the USA to whom the Constitution and the Bill Of Rights apply... No, I can't think of anything... Motherfuckers Those bastards - That's it! - We're here That's the flag! We made it What are they doing there?

How can he talk? Shake your head- You're gonna kill him, you fucking idiot! Mr Chairman... Clear the court! Clear the court! We've already made the sentences I feel so ashamed Nobody's touching that flag! They were just surrendering peaceably My Christ, I've heard about the American police! I'm glad you got to see it. Tell all your friends about it Send them postcards from England because that's where they'll listen This is going on European TV... I don't give a good goddamn where it goes! ... and France and Germany! Bloody barbarians! Remind you bloody European bastards of the goddamn American soldiers that are dead in your goddamn country when you're talking about it! 10 minutes later - Why did you do that? - Because they goddamn deserved it They killed two officers! That wasn't part of the goddamn game Don't you goddamn come near us We're just doing our job and I'm tired of you hassling us! Can you tell us why you did what you did? For the same reason he did. They had it coming to them They had a chance to stop. Did they stop? I'm asking you Because they rushed us That' not a reason, man! That' not a reason! They wouldn't have rushed us if you hadn't been there... Oh, shit You were one who started this I started it? I told the man to stop. The captain told the man to stop And that's all there is to it. He didn't stop. He attacked me I don't care what the fuck you think You can do with your newsreels whatever you want This is the second night this has happened You could have let those 4 people come straight through Had they wanted to they could have done that We're dealing with criminals who have killed two of my men As it happens these 4 people have not hurt a goddamn fly on the entire desert Do you think we'd let them reach that flag? Do you think they deserve that flag? They belong to this country as much as you do They care about this country as much as you do What the hell are they doing out here? They gave up their rights when they started breaking this country's laws That's what we're here for: To enforce those laws And we do a goddamn good job of it! You're making out like a big humanitarian The only thing you want is to sell this to your goddamn network I don't see you putting any band-aids on anybody All you want is the money for this program You could have opened your ranks and let them go through This happened in Chicago. It happened in Los Angeles Were you at Chicago? Lt'll happen as long as we've got this type to deal with Get the defendants out of here You see what your great land is all about? No, we haven't cheated You cheated. You never intended to let them finish the course You're full of shit You had radios They've obviously been under control You have your opinion. There's nothing that will change it and it isn't worth my valuable time to talk to you Keep these sons of bitches out of here - That's bullshit! - We've had enough of this The 48th Emergency Internal Security Tribunal of the SW region as authorized by Executive Order No. 302 William C. Hoager, chairman, presiding is hereby concluded - What have they done to her head? - They've bashed her about the jaw Since the completion of this film one of the members of its cast appearing as defendant Charles Robbins has been indicted on a charge of conspiracy to bomb The sentence on this charge has not yet been determined For a second charge of assault on a police officer this cast member has been sentenced to 3 years in a federal prison Under the provisions of Title 2 of the 1950 Internal Security Act, also known as the McCarran Act, the President of the United States of America is still authorized, without further approval by Congress, to determine an event of insurrection in the United States and to declare the existence of an "internal security emergency". The President is then authorized to apprehend and detain each person as to whom there is reasonable ground to believe probably will engage in certain future acts of sabotage. Persons apprehended shall be given a hearing without right of bail or the necessity of evidence and shall then be confined to places of detention. KBCR News, the Southlands' most comprehensive news coverage. The President signed an executive order calling to immediate duty 100,000 reservists. Pentagon sources indicate that at least 20,000 of these troops would be sent to North-East Asia in response to the shelling of Seoul, capital of South Korea, last week. Sources gave no indication how the remaining reservists might be used. It was not confirmed that they would help law enforcement officials deal with current domestic disorders. At least 273 Americans are reported killed and a further 492 wounded as an advance force of 30,000 US, Cambodian and South Korean soldiers drove deep into the Hill 98 and Whalesback regions of Laos in the heaviest attack so far since the war was extended. Patrick John Edwards, you are guilty of conspiracy to undermine the national security and intent to incite to riot. You are sentenced to 15 to 21 years in a federal penitentiary. You have the alternative of 4 days in Punishment Park. How do you choose? I'd like to thank the court for its fairness- Silence. How do you choose? Punishment Park. Time 9am. The Bear Mountain National Punishment Park in Southern California. Right there. Stop. You right behind him. Right there. You overthere. Next man. OK. That woman there. The last man in line. Go on into the tent. The 47th Emergency Internal Security Tribunal forthe SW Region as authorized by executive order no. 302, William C. Hoeger, Chairman, presiding, is hereby concluded. The UN today became the focus of world attention as the US delegate challenged the Russians to admit that their submarines had moved into the Caribbean. He made it clear that the US will tolerate no threats to its sovereignty and he accused the Soviets of trying to divert attention from the Middle East. After heated discussion, the US delegate indicated that the communist bloc were responsible for the tripling of our monthly draft calls. He denied the Russian delegate's accusation that the US government is building up a large army for the suppression of its own people. Do you like your job of slaughtering young people? Sen. George McLewis resigned from the Senate after 22 years of active service. He said in a press conference shortly after that he could no longer participate in the dismantling of basic freedoms for which this country was established. In a statement, he mentioned specifically the types of "repressive" legislation which led to his sudden resignation, including the no-knock and stop-and-frisk laws, cancellation of immunity from 5th Amendment cases, preventative detention, the activation of detention camps and quasi-judicial tribunals. He said that he was particularly disturbed by the activities of the Punishment Parks. The Marshal will now bring the 48th session to order.

Temperature 89 degrees. At the time of your sentencing, you will be able to choose between a penal sentence orthe alternative of Punishment Park. Punishment Park, described by the US Senate Subcommittee On Law And Order as "a necessary training for the "law officers and National Guard of the country "in the control of those elements who seek "the violent overthrow of the US government "and the means of providing a punitive deterrent "for said subversive elements." You will speak only when spoken to. Each violation of this ruling will result in a citation for contempt for one year in a federal penitentiary in addition to the sentence duly passed. Finally, I wish to announce that we have with us TV cameras of the National Network. Also those of Britain and West Germany. It is hoped to document these proceedings in the widest manner as we know their import to be of vital concern to the people of the free world. Their coverage will be impartial. - Bullshit! - This trial is illegitimate. - This trial is illegitimate- - Quiet! These are the members of Corrective Group 638 and these the members of Corrective Group 637, now sentenced to spending 3 days in Punishment Park. First defendant. - What's your name? - My name is Brown, motherfucker! Lee Robert Brown, well-known author, broadcaster and political activist. I want to be tried by a jury of my peers, black people! In front of witnesses who identify themselves. Witnesses! Keep the defendant silent! Restrain him! No end for the heatwave which has been frying Los Angeles for three months. Temperatures will top 100 for the 12th straight day in downtown LA with the Valley due for 105. Tonight's low will be 79. The deserts can expect mercury readings of 1 15 plus.

These you can see to yourfront. These mountains are 16.5 miles from where you're standing. You will direct yourselves toward the indicating lights. Pursuit Leaderto 245, ready your signal. You will head past this point immediately he took exception. I had to give him a shot. - I'll show it to him. - No, we'll tell him. - You get him. - Okay. My mother and father, after all these years... Well, that's the way life ends sometimes. All the hostilities and suspicions we feel every day, we hold them down. But they always come out. Forgot my keys. Here. That's all right, Mom. I'll get in through the cellar. Eddie, look, you can see that they can't ever live together in this house again. You don't agree? Appreciate your check by return mail. Yours truly, Sam Arness. Oh, is that all you got? That's all? Evangelos! Evangelos! Go down delicatessen. Bring half-pound ham, half-pound tongue, half-pound Swiss cheese. He's gone to sleep, Sam. For the last two years while he's been hitting and cursing her, where were you? Every time I look at this house, I could kill him. I could kill Michael. Four spades, double. Do you realize your mother spent 40 years in that house slaving for that monster? - Shut up! I tell you... - Hey. Hey. She's your wife, now keep her mouth... I just have to get a few things. Come here. Why do you make me do that? Why did you do that? I was about to hit her with my fist. Look, darling, Gloria realizes that you're not exactly rational at the moment. Eddie, darling. Let's go in there where it's quiet. Remember, Eddie? In there? It was the first time, wasn't it? Remember? There's only one thing I ever wanted, Florence. I wanna be a writer. Oh, baby, you can be anything. Anything you choose to be. Well, when I told Dr. Leibman that you didn't like the person you were he said that was the cause of most of the unhappiness in the world. And that you were right, it was time for you to accept that you are what you are. Eddie, look. - What are you thinking? - Don't you think my father has a right to live the rest of his life as irrational as he wants? - On his own terms. - Yes, but, Eddie you cannot put your father and your mother in the same house again. - So, what are your plans? - I want you to come home with me on the next plane and I want you to work with Dr. Leibman. You know what you can do with Dr. Leibman. Thanks a lot, but no, thanks. Baby, you need help and I need your help. - I haven't said anything yet about Ellen. - Changing the subject. She's in New York. She hasn't gone back to school. She needs a father, Eddie. And Dr. Leibman, he's pretty smart. He says you can adopt a child but there's a time when the child has to adopt you. What are you and Gloria planning about my father? We have no plans. Have you? Yes. Florence, I'm gonna have him live with me. - Eddie, it... It just wouldn't work. - Why not? - Lf you were yourself, you'd see that. - Obviously, I'm not myself. - He needs constant care. - I'll give it to him. Oh, Eddie, let's face it. He's a different kind of person than we are. Florence. He's my father. What the hell is all this sudden pretense that you care about him? - You'd like to kill him. - Dr. Leibman speaking. - Sooner or later you will. - Why are you so violent? Because you and I have got a huge reconstruction job to do and because... Why? Because where were you last night? Where were you, all night, last night? All night. I was with Gwen last night. All night, last night. You... What are you whispering about? Eddie, come with us. Gloria has a list of homes, we're going to drive and look at some. - We've decided that... - In this case, I decide. In this case, your mother has the last word and she agrees with us. Well, ask her. Oh, by the way, I just spoke to Gloria on the phone and she said that they've found a very nice home for Mr. Arness. No, Father. Old folks' homes are for people who have nobody. He has me. I remember day I arrived this country. I was 19. Beautiful boy. Can you believe it? First time I saw shore. - Dr. Weeks. - Long Island. Tell me, isn't there anything that can be done for him, really? Make him as happy as you can for as long as you can. First time I saw shore, then... - I was thinking... - Actually, Gloria said... - I was thinking of taking him to Florida. - Oh, Mr. Arness. There's a town of Greek sponge fishermen down there. You mean kidnap him? I'm sorry. You'd have to give permission, wouldn't you? - Yes. And, of course, I couldn't do that. - Father Draddy? Mr. Willis is looking for you. What if I were to? Kidnap him? I couldn't give permission. But despite that if you were to, the best time would be around midnight. I'll be giving the nurses on the floor some special instructions. Going down. Thanks, Charles. Come on, Pop. Upstairs to bed for you. - I sleep here. - Pop, you can't stay here. - I sleep here. - Pop, you... She give my keys certain persons. You understand? All my business papers. Don't repeat that. Who knows what kind, God knows, monkey business going on? My feet cold. Yeah, I'll get something for you. There, feel that? You're gonna be warm in a couple of minutes. - Tomorrow, first thing, we go to bank. - Right, Pop. Tomorrow I'm gonna buy you those little white grapes you like, huh? I hear that before too. Are you really gonna take him to the bank tomorrow? What else can I do? His feet were like ice. - What's his name? - Sam Arness. Sam, it's good to see you. Come in. But after I'm married, we could see each other. Get a place, fix it up and I'd take care of you there. That's all you want of me anyway, the night stuff, everything perfect. And that's all I want of you. You say you want the truth. That'd be it. Isn't that what you've always wanted? Money is a little tight right now. Gwen. - Tomorrow. - Right. What time is it? Morning. I don't know. Gwen, I'm gonna marry you. I don't hear a sound out of you for a year and a half. Now you come on with that marriage salami. - What the hell do you think I am? - Gwen, I'm going to marry you. Did you expect to find me waiting here, my tail on ice, with your... - I expected what I got. - Let me tell you what you got. After you dropped me at Chet's, I made up my mind to clean you out of me. The next night I went to Downey's. A guy said, "Have a drink. " - I said, "You're in luck. " - And? To finish you off, I called up Jack Schnee. - The poster man? - That's right. - What was his attraction? - You didn't like him. That was his attraction, that's the way I went. And I'll tell you the best of all. An Italian. A movie producer: Fat, pig rich, arrogant. An old man with a nothing body. But he'd look at me and he'd smile that soft Italian smile and he'd hold me with those soft Italian hands. Like the hands of one of those old saints. No poetry about love but such affection. The purest, the most honest, the most believable thing... - I don't care. You're gonna marry me. - People aren't that way. They pretend, lie, like you do, because they can't take it the way they really are: Faithless. You can't take it the way you really are, faithless. And the way I really am. And love? For songs. "Love" is the word they say before they pull your guts out. What are you doing here? - You can lie to me but I'm not gonna... - You're here because you love me. - I don't love you, you son of a bitch! - Don't lie to me! Stop it, son of a bitch! Stop it! Stop it! Taxi here? I'm ready. Get out of here! Did you see that? He was raping her! I mean he's insane, literally. Literally insane. All right, go. Fix breakfast. - I talk to boy alone. - Don't talk to her that way. It's okay. How about some scrambled eggs? - I don't want make trouble. - He wants eggs. Evangelos, don't get fresh with me. Pop, how'd you sleep on that couch last night? - Your grandfather was here last night. - What'd he say? He was angry with me. He said, "Seraphim. Seraphim, you are not finished. " What'd he mean by that? Everybody trying to bury me. - Come on, now. - You too. - Pop, I don't wanna bury you. - We soon find out. - You keep doubting me. - Because I want you to give me money. I'm going into business again. Now then. How much you got? I don't know. You ever hear anything like this? Grown man doesn't know how much he has in bank. Amen, amen. Now, how much you got? - You and Frances? - Florence, Pop. L... I really don't know. Miss, I find my life, all conversation change when subject money. You find same thing? Evening before, everything "Sweetheart, honey, lollipop" plenty chop-chop monkey business. Next morning, cold behind, right? - That's life. - But from your son, you should expect... Yeah, you boy. All my life, I ask favor nobody. - For chrissakes, Pop. - Forget it. Gold isn't everything, right? Pennies from heaven, falling down. Guarantee, falling down, guarantee. Right? Pop. Please, Pop, why don't you sit down? The truth is, I do have some property, but I don't think I have any cash. Miss, you ever hear anything like that? Grown boy lying to his father? I'm not lying, Pop. That's the truth. Evangelos, why you make me beg like this in front of stranger? This is my last chance. Everybody laughing at me. Everybody says, "He's finished. - Sam's finished. No brains. " - You've got plenty of brains. - Lf you don't get this, no brains. - That's not the point, Pop. I know, the point is gelt, gelt, gelt is more important than your own family! I'm just like my father. Evangelos, my last hope is on you. You owe me. Look at me. You see those Irish, those Armenians, send their sons college? I worked my way through college. You did everything you could to stop me. If it wasn't for Mother... Where do you think she got money? From my pockets! Send good-for-nothing, hopeless-case son Shakespeare-and-so-forth college. But then you found out what life is and you make bigshot success because you got merchant blood here, here, here. Don't give me that merchant-blood shit! - You're selfish, mean... - You have my blood, my brains. - I have my blood, my brains! - Look your face! - I am not like you! - You same goods like me. - I was never like you! - Now, why you don't give me money? "Money, money, money. " - I'm a bad business risk. - I'm ashamed to be your son! In your place, I do exactly that! - You said...? - I said, "I'm ashamed to be your son. " All right. Sam finished. Sam Arness finished. All right. All right. First time in 45 years, I wasn't able to control what I felt about that old man. Eddie, look, what's that? Evangelos! Evangelos! Evangelos! Mr. Anderson? Mr. Anderson. Don't worry, Charles, I'm going away. Where? Into myself. You're what? You better see a doctor. A priest. See a priest. One last thing. I don't know exactly who Andy's father is and I don't care but I did my arithmetic and he's not yours. So it's better this way, right? Right. Thomna! Thomna! Thomna! What's this bill? Tuition? What's that? Tuition. Thomna. You put Shakespeare college in this damn-fool boy's head? All my life I work, make business for this boy future. And now when I need him, you teach him leave his father. Evangelos! Taxi, I'm ready. Sam, it's the boy's life. He doesn't want rug business. He wants something different. Oh, Mom. What the hell kind of lesson was that to give a boy? I can't blame Pop. You should've... You should've taught me to stick up for myself. Not that, Mom. Not that. Are you out of your goddamn mind? - Clean. And when are you going to change to Zephyr? Now, what is it, your mother's fault, your father's fault? What's that, Freud? You are you, kid. Eddie Anderson, the indispensable man. All right. Let's get down to nuts and bolts. Congratulations. - Congratulations. - I've always said, time... You had power, then. Remember what it felt like? Power. Ram it in. Power. The fact is, without your job and without the money in your pocket, you're nothing. Well, look at you. The most impressive part of you right now? That cigar. Hey, don't look at me like that, baby. If you think you're gonna get rid of me, you're out of your mind. You had the perfect arrangement. Fat job, beautiful house, understanding wife. All the side nooky you could handle. You had it all. You did. What is that, Edward? A little composition of your own? They're coming to get you, Eddie. - Edward. - The Marines. Edward, since I've come 3000 miles solely for the purpose of talking to you I don't think I should be required to do so through a screen. Edward. Edward, I've come all the way from California to chat with you. And I'm going to chat with you. Edward, you look terrible. What are you doing to yourself? This is not you. Something has taken possession of you, Edward. Come on now, snap out of it. What? I can't hear you. - This is me. - Applesauce. - Damn fool. - Had it all. You did. Edward. I'm gonna have to protect you and yours, Florence in particular from whatever demon is at work inside of you. And if extreme measures are necessary... And at this point I think they may be. - I will most certainly take them. You are causing havoc on all sides. You start by kidnapping a man who doesn't know which end's up. - Evangelos. - Where is he? My father. For reasons that are obvious, I'm not prepared to tell you. - He's my goddamn father. - He's in excellent care. - Where? - Where he ought to be. In a home for the aged and incompetent. Evangelos. - "Incompetent. " - Yes, Edward. I'm sorry, but you've got to be made to face the facts. Goddamn it, Edward, pay attention to me. If you don't like the way we live, change it. Be fair, be just, Eddie. Time is short, Edward, but this marriage can still be made to work. That is what I consider to be my duty as your family lawyer. Darling, if I didn't see you through this, what would I be for? What would I be for? Will you stop wandering and listen? Forget the property involved, although it's considerable. But Florence, Edward, Florence. You're married, you damn fool, to the perfect woman. There isn't a man I know who doesn't envy you. How many women, I ask you, would have endured what Florence has endured? Maybe Florence shouldn't have. Some instinct tells her that this marriage can still be made to work even though she's in a state of shock and... Oh, hell. Oh, Eddie, I know it's going to be good again like it was in the beginning. - I have faith in that. - Faithless! Incidentally, is the young lady still upstairs? And the way I really am. Are you preparing a divorce action? That will not be necessary, providing you do precisely as I say. You never meant it when you said you'd leave your wife. And that is...? First, I want you, for your own deepest good to go away somewhere for a long, long rest. In a home for the incompetent? Somewhere. I'll overlook the sarcasm. Somewhere so that you can regain your balance reconstitute your sense of values. - And so that Florence, well, can recover. - Are you in love with my wife? I beg your pardon? I hit on something, didn't I? I must try to remember that you are in a paranoid state. But I will say this: Florence is an extraordinary woman who is being slaughtered by an ego run wild. Since you won't believe me, I suggest you ask Ellen who drove out here with me... - He's right, Daddy. Mommy. Hello, darling... Look. Hello, Florence. Excuse me. Dr. Leibman, Eddie's here. Should I stay out a little longer? No, no, of course not, come in. Come in. Well, if it isn't my old playmate. Well, if it isn't my old playmate. I smell money. I smell money. Whenever I see a psychoanalyst and a lawyer, I smell money but this time, I smell it all around me. Florence, may I ask you to explain that remark? Dr. Leibman, please. I have an appointment. - Well, I'm going back on the 6:00 plane. - I got a date with a manicurist downstairs. I can fix it up for you too. She's a little hairy here and there but... - Edward, Edward. - I need a quick consultation. Can we have a quick consultation, doctor? Are you in love with my wife too? Well, she is attractive. You're so cute. I love his mustache. I'd spend the whole week playing with you, hold my hand. - Edward, do you mind? - You're damn right I mind. I came here to talk to my wife, I didn't... Arthur. Arthur, stop wandering. Pay attention, please. - Arthur, do something. - All right. - Thank you. - Just... Let's settle back. I smell money. Oh, I can still smell money. Am I getting warmer? Is this what it's all about? "Community property: Both houses, all land, art objects automobiles, furniture, effects... " You forgot the contents of the Deepfreeze. "... to my wife Florence until I am, in her judgment, again a responsible person. " "Her judgment"? Oh, well, give me a pen. Who are you? What's the difference? Eddie, don't. Don't sign it. I have no objections. There you are. I always knew your heart would... Your heart's in the right place. Now, you can all get the hell out of here, I'm gonna talk to my wife. You're right. Now, we'll all sit down. Afraid I'm getting a headache. Well, how are you, Florence? I have trouble sleeping in this awful city. Yeah, it's been tough on you. But how are you really? Well, I... I've been feeling ashamed. Because... Because... I don't know. Suddenly, it's like I was persecuting you. You're doing what you have to do. Eddie, can I ask you again? Is all this about her? Not really, no. I'm prettier than she is. Yes. You are. Then what...? What is it about? My self-respect. That's all? That's all. I mean... You know, I mean, I thought perhaps it was something... - Serious? - I didn't say that. I ought to slap you right across the face for that. You mean, that what you've been doing... That. Increases your self-respect? I was... I was going to say that perhaps it... It was something I couldn't help you with. The night after you left I was at a party. And I went home with another man. And when he touched me I went dry. Eddie, you're all I've ever wanted. I'm waiting for you. I know you finally kicked her out. She left me. I don't believe any woman would leave you, Eddie. She's marrying Charles. Any minute. Oh, Eddie. Eddie, I can make you happier than any woman, if you'll only let me. And I... I know that all this, somehow, somewhere, is my fault too. Don't think I don't. You know, you look very well. You've absolutely no business looking so well, you bastard, but you do. Come. Come with me. Lie with me. Side by side, just like we used to. There. Oh, I'd stick with you through anything. You already have. Yes, I have, haven't I? That's all. That's all. And now, you tell me, Eddie how you want it to be. How it should be, so that you'll be happy. And that's the way, so help me God, it's going to be. Oh, Florence. - All I want is... - Yes. Go on. To do absolutely... nothing. Fine. What are you going to do? Just be. Well, what will you be? Nothing. Be. But be what? - Be nothing? - Yes. - Eddie, you're a talented man, you can... - Yes. Nothing. Just be myself. Sounds silly. - No, no, not at all. - You know, walk places. You know. Sit down, think. - Maybe. - Like Tolstoy? No, like me. But, Eddie, Tolstoy could afford it. He was a very rich man. - He had lots of slaves... - We have property. Sell it. - I wish you could see the new bills... - I want you to sell that house. And sell our place in the desert. Sell the cars, the paintings that Bulgarian statue in the garden. Sell the books, the records, Deepfreeze, everything. I'm head of the house. That's an order. Sell it. Yes, but, Eddie, be sensible. Where would we go? What do we really need? We'll get a small apartment and start from scratch. Eddie, you've worked hard all your life, you deserve a comfortable living. But I wasn't comfortable. I kept trying to kill myself. Florence, look, I know I've... I've done bad things to you, Ellen, other people but nothing like what I've done to myself. I didn't say that you were perfect. But, Eddie, dear, you once had consideration for other people. Eddie, darling, be a decent man again. Eddie. Think of someone besides yourself. All I ever did was think of everyone except myself. I've got to learn to be selfish. That was never your trouble, Eddie. Not that. - Not being... Not being selfish. - Yes, yes, yes, that's it. I've got to learn to be selfish. Our whole life was built around you, Eddie. Oh, the minutes. The minutes. - The minutes. - What minutes? The minutes of my life. Do you want me to sell them again? - Eddie, calm down. - I don't feel calm. Why should I calm? I swear to God! I'll never again... I'm never again gonna work at a job I despise. Never. - Never. - Yes, yes, yes. But what are you going to do? I wanna do... :one: ...small, good thing before I die. One thing I really respect. Yes, of course. That's what I want. That's all. One small, decent... Such as wallowing in that tramp. It has nothing to do with her. And don't call her a tramp. I'll call her what she is. He signed my signature to this. Call her whatever you like. She's less of a tramp than most of our friends. When you tell me about your great new life, I know what that means. - What do you know about Gwen? - Everything, Arthur's had her investigated. - Investigated? - Yes. We know who she's been with. Do you want the report? - Investigated, huh? - How many times and where. I'm in better shape than you are. I can teach... - Bought, paid for. - So what? She wouldn't prepare commitment papers behind her husband's back. I didn't do that. She wouldn't plot to jail her husband in a mental institution. - I didn't agree to that. - There's a paper in her lawyer's pocket that would put me in a mental institution on a writ signed by you! - I refused to sign that! - But you are! At this very instant you are considering whether you should sign it, aren't you? - Aren't you? Aren't you? - Daddy! - Admit it! Now, admit it! - Daddy, don't! - Admit it! Aren't you? Admit it! - Help! Help! Arthur, help me! - Admit it! - Arthur! - Arthur! - You admit it! - Arthur! Help! - Daddy! Arthur! - Liar! Liar! - Help! Arthur, he's insane. Perhaps Your Honor's judgment might be that this man should be allowed to benefit from psychopatholo... The reason she thinks that perhaps Your Honor's judgment might be that this man should benefit from psychopathological treatment... The best available. - Has to do with the damage that he's done, not to others, but to himself. I have been able to piece together what Mr. Arness did the rest of that day that brought him to this mental hospital in the condition that he's now in. It took considerable investigation. Excuse me. I thought I might put the results before Your Honor. Hold on. Do you have any objections, Mr. Arness? Do you? As a way of starting. Mr. Arness, do you object? Mr. Arness, would you remember, I'm here to protect you not to prosecute you. You may proceed. Our first information came from some children who were playing in front of the old family home on Long Island Sound. They saw Mr. Arness drive up in a cab walk into the old place and pull down the shades. We must bear in mind, Your Honor, as we consider the events that this man has twice tried to destroy himself. In fact, missed doing so only by a miracle. You'll regret it. You'll regret it. Go ahead. None of us will ever know, of course what went on in the private hell that is the soul of this man. All we know is what his nearest neighbor told us. That at about 9:00 that night he heard an explosion. And when he went to the window, he saw the old place in flames. He called the fire department, rushed over and found Mr. Arness inside the burning house throwing the furniture, curtains, anything he could find into the blaze, feeding it. How Mr. Arness got out, or where he went, no one could imagine. I might add, however, that stored in the cellar of the old place were the commercial records, files, ledgers, correspondence in fact, the entire history of his father's business life. When that old gentleman heard about it, he broke down and wept. His whole life. What? That was his whole life. And this? This was where he...? Dr. Weeks, perhaps you would take over. We were expecting him to come to the hospital to visit his father so when I was told that he was downstairs in a cab, I wasn't surprised. But I didn't expect to find him unconscious in a pool of blood, his own. - Take me to Room 612. - Take him to Emergency. - And who did he say shot him? - Wouldn't say then or later. Whoever shot him escaped without a clue. Mr. Arness lodged no complaint. Mr. Arness. It'd help me no end to make this decision I've got to make about your future if you would tell me exactly what you're thinking this instant. I sat there, I watched those flames and I felt better than I've felt in a long time. You know. You lit them. And that's why I came here. I wanted to thank you for that. No one else to thank. Fortunately, both shots, though aimed at vital spots lodged in extremely fleshy areas. And though painful, the wounds... Charles. I only came here to say thanks. Don't, Charles. I like you, Charles. I like you too. I wanna stay here. He was railroaded. You've got him in prison here. There are days I wish I could get as mad as you, but it's not allowed here. I suggest you go see... - Judge Morris? - Yes? Well, Dr. Lloyd tells me you gave him a great going over this morning. It's a case of revenge, pure and simple. His wife and her lawyer... May I ask just who you are? - Are you his...? - I'm... How do they say it? Just a good friend. I'm sure that's just what he needs. I'm sure she didn't mean that the way it sounded. Our problem isn't how to keep them in, it's how to get them to leave. That place is chock full of middle-aged dropouts. They even have a turned-off rabbi out there. Yeah, it's a place where... Well, somebody called it "a human dumping ground. " But I kind of resent that. It's more of an escape hatch, you might say, from what's outside. It's a hiding place for the unwanted. The last stop. That's why so many of them do their level damnedest to stay in. Take our Mr. Arness, for instance. Apparently, or so they tell me, he's so happy he hasn't felt the need to address himself to anyone for two weeks. You know he can walk out of that place the minute he has a job and a roof over his head. He's not so inclined. Not in the least. Nice baby. Nice baby. Come on, get up. We're going. Don't give me that silent treatment, Eddie. Come on, get up. They said that if you had a job over your head, that you... Well, that you could leave this place. I have a job for you, Eddie. What kind of employment, may I ask? Gwen, these are my friends. Well, that's up to him. Madam, that's hardly worth leaving here for. Well, when these old people break a hip so they can't walk, they can't stand the chance of pneumonia is... Well, like your father. Before you know it... Hi, Pop. - Don't. Don't. - Oh, but I'm going to. - Time to go to bed. - I mean, don't stop. Don't ever stop. Okay, girls, come on, come on. So give your family Hollingshead Gravies: Better than the kind Mother used to make and quicker. The sense of touch... Evangelos. Evangelos... I'm here, Pop. Taxi here? I'm ready. You know, he looked... Not my father, just a frightened man who wants the same things I want, another chance. Another chance. I love you, Gwen. Thank you. In South Africa, between the rivers Orange and Zambezi there is a desert area of 275,000 square miles, called the Kalahari. The first European to cross the desert Kalahari was David Livingstone in 1849. In 1878, a group of Germans tried to move her, to reach Angola. 250 people and 9,000 heads of cattle cattle died of thirst in the dunes, slain by dry winds This red desert.

Yes I Am Anything could happen. - I think there is a river, but, probably very far. - How long can he hold out? - Well, if it is in the red desert, then two or three days, and if it is not in the red sand dunes, then maybe a week. - Come on, Lolly. And ... It's dried up river. - Lolly, run! Back, back! - How much it will be able to survive so, Smitty? - Do not worry, sir. he could hold out for long. We'll find him before he dies. - Lolli!

Lolly! - Is it true that you said Smitty? If he knows that there is someone, who loves him very, very much, will not give up, no matter how bad. - Oh, yes, sir, he will not give up so easily. - I do not know Smitty. You see, when his mother was alive, she took him on her lap, stroking ... And he knew that she loved him. But the man does not know more closed, how to express their love. I played with him ... But he knows he, as I love him? - Yes, sir, he needs to know. And he really wants to go back, because he knows how you need it.

Yes I Am. Look, you can cancel the concert tonight? I can not come. - I already did it. Maybe something eshsche? - Yes, Jack, I want to make a flyer with precise recommendations what to do, to survive until we find him. And I want to throw away two million leaflets from the air. - Two million? - This is a huge area. - It will be very expensive. - How Much? - Watch ... Leaflet size ... ... four thousand ... About ten thousand rand! - Jack, you get money. Well, I'll see what I can do. But you know, it means that you have to sell all that you have, You will not be able to take so much money. - Two million? This is crazy. worth it will be eight, nine, ten thousand rand. - And anything that you have invested in your company "Save Our Souls" twenty thousand? - Our company "Save Our Souls" to do not go bankrupt takes a commission of 3%. - Well, take 10 thousand and komisiiyu do a little more. - This pianist has advised you? - No, it is not. But I feel that we need to help. - Okay. I think about it. I'll tell you in the morning. - Lolly! - Mr De Vries! Mr. De Vries! My newspaper will print leaflets for you! - Free? - Yes I Do! - How Come? - We want to help you. - And the real reason? - Okay ... Your story will increase our circulation. - Did you think I'm cold and selfish, but if you reject the offer, you are depriving your son's chance of survival .. - I was not going to give up. Give in your newspaper that I sign everything you need to sign up. And ... tell them thank you. - Hello, Jack, no longer need to sell anything. Leaflets will print for free. - Oh ... I'm not afraid! .. It should be lower ... First, they cook ... about two dozen ... - I want you to tell me, what to write - how to find water, how to find food. - Excuse me, sir, you should write: "I love you very much and I'll find you." - Yes I Am. - Dad! Daddy! - All the rivers seem to be parched, but need just start digging where there was a river .. Sometimes the water is very close, under a thin layer of sand, but not always. - Lolly! Lolly, Lolly! ... And I'm thinking that you're dead, Lolly ... I missed you so much ... Okay, let's go, Dad probably worried ... You must be dying of hunger ... Last night I found a thousand birds' eggs. Me and you, too, will find. - Not Bad. It's not too much you like it? I'll find us something better. - Take it, take it! Now it is necessary to kill. I think it's better if you kill him. Come on, you do it. Let the leaves. He's too skinny. - And What You Can Eat - Anything that he usually does not eat. Sorry, sir, but I'll tell you - it the only way to survive in this region. Perhaps there is even snakes. - But the serpent will bite him! - We need to take a long stick, And if he finds a snake, you kill it with a stick and eat. - There are a lot of things that could be use, but he does not know until he sees. - Damn! Ouch! They bite! It's delicious! - Eat it, Lolly. - You have to eat, it is delicious, Eat immediately, even people eat it. Come on, Lolly, eat! Tonight we scrambled eggs! Come on, Lolly, let's go! - He will always go to the south. - Why? - This is the direction of migration ... Goes aimlessly, so can be circled and circled ... - Yes, but why in the south? - Well, first, if it will turn on west, then gets into the red desert. Then he will certainly die. In the white desert he can find food and water. But not in the red dunes. There's nothing. - And there are no people ... - I quote - "I love you very much and I'll find you." I know I've read about this sad fact, but all this has been going on for so long. Do you want to get up on this? - No, I support him. - Why are you doing this? To make it available to the public or to save the life of his son? - I do not think he wants to go public because of the leaflets. - He gave us exclusive rights to his story. So tell him that at first he enters the news, and then you ... - But ... - And I'm not going to write in the newspaper "Love Story", only to PR your pianist. And tell him. - Jack, sell all my possessions. No, the newspaper took back his promise, sell all that I have and .... tell as amended, to start typing. let's scattered leaflets from the air. "I love you and I'll find you." - You stay here. Lolly, get back! - Do you think that he is still alive, Smitty? Sir, we have to believe. You said that it is not very strong, but the desert will make him stronger. He will learn to understand what to do in different situations and he just will not give up. - Do not move. I'm going ... - For you, says Kurt Lawrence ... Dirks De Vries is still not found. The latest radiocommunications, son of a touring pianist De Vries disappeared after the plane crash five days ago, army sent in search of a further 25 helicopters. Two million leaflets were distributed over the territory in the area of three hundred and fifty thousand square miles. Many owners of private jets offer their help in the search for the boy. But this faint hope - to find a child with Aircraft on such a large area. So, the primary task - find a crashed plane, and then send an army of people and transport to the site of the crash and procheshet territory. is alive or not a child - is unknown. - Come on, Lolly. - I do not come back. Come on, Lolly. Sand! It's just sand. Let'S Go. Come on, Lolly. It's only sand. Oh ... you're afraid ... Let'S Go. Oh, you're too heavy. Something wrong. No one there. Let's go back. - Oh, no! Leave her alone! Beast! Come on! You beast! You monster! Get Out! You ok? I'm sure - tomorrow we'll find someone. We turn to the doctor and he will cure you. Do not worry, I'll take care of you. Dad would be happy to see it. We'll find someone tomorrow. - Colonel, can I take with a Smitty, please? - Where to? - I'm going to look for my son. - Which way to go? East, West, North, South? Look! Botswana, Angola, South-West, South Africa. We do not know in what country your son. We searched for him for six days, but have not found the right direction. So where will you look for? - But I can not sit here and do nothing! - Anything you can do, you're done. Now you just have to wait and pray. - We'll never find, Lolly. "Dirks, I you very much I love and I will find you " Where is the other half? - My father loves me, and he will find me ... My father loves me, and he will find me ... - Anton, you should go home. - I can not. - But you're there for a week and only make that wait and wait, when did you return? - Give me a few more days. - Okay, let's say, three days, okay? - Okay. - Where are the helicopters? - I sent them back to Pretoria. - You will not stop looking! Three groups are patrolling every day ... - And never find it! ... - Anton, your son is in the desert for two weeks. He died. - No. - I have to be tough, because you need to recognize that the child died, and you have to close The home and forget. - I've come to take you home. we Are agreed that you will stay for three days. That was six days ago! - Hello, Jack. Look, if I leave everything and go home, they stop searching. - Let's face it - can not be that he was still alive. You have to work and try to forget that you had a son. I was not able to sell your furniture, so I had to borrow five thousand. You have to go back and give the money. - Thank U. Lolly? Lolly? No! Get out! Leave me alone! Get out! Leave me alone! Lolly! She is here! And her puppies! Go take a look! Do not go! Hey, wait, do not leave me here! Hey, wait, do not brasayte me alone! Do not leave me, please! Wait a minute! Wait for me! Hey, wait for me! No, no, please! Please! - Good morning. - Good Morning. - How are you? - I - well. You can tell your boss that I am fine. - I did not come here for the sake of history. - Maybe sit down? I work to forget. It is not easy. - Is there anything I can do for you? - De Vries. Where? Port Arthur? Yes, yes, I'm going. They found the wreckage of the plane. Burned. Sorry, I ... I ... - Yes, I understand. Thank U. - And I'm sorry, I was wrong. - Your people must conduct extended Search on this site. Your mobile units are searching for with a radius of 20 degrees. and tell them to stay away from red dunes. There's no one would survive. All Lieutenant. - Colonel. - Guys! Survey the neighborhood. Move to the distance of 20 degrees. And stay away from the red dunes. Started. - Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. Colonel here? - No, sir, all gone in search of the boy. - They wanted a red dunes? - No, the colonel said, the child there survive. - Well, of course, let's go! - Where to? - To the red dunes! He is there! - He's in the red dunes and it's my fault, because I said that he should go to the south. But who would have thought that he would be there. - Maybe he has not found a flyer? - There were two million! - Bushmen. We need to talk to them. Maybe they saw the boy or his footprints. Sir! He says he saw the baby! The day before yesterday. - Where? - Over there, in the middle of the desert. - He was still alive? - What did he say? Says the baby was alive. He left it there. He says the child was evil. This means that he was obsessed. It was an evil spirit. - But how could he leave the child to die there? - He said the child was throwing stones. This is a big taboo ... If someone throws something at them ... - Fair Enough, tell him that I will give him a lot of money, if he only shows us where the child. - Do not agree. Says he does not want to again closer to the boy. - Tell him to only bring up the place where he had seen the child. - Now what? Said the boy over there. This thing will stick in the dunes, better to drive the party or go with a bushman walk. - No, I can not risk it. Do You Stay in the car, and I'll go with him. - Then you'd better get a gun. And when he can find - shoot, so I can hear where you are. And I'm going to click on the signal of the machine, and you'll hear where I am. - Okay. - Dirk! Dirks! Dirk! Dirks! Dirk! Lolly? Lolly! Dirk! Dirk! He is alive! He's alive! Ben! Ben, you were right! I found it! Benny! Bennie, where are you? Ben! Ben! No, Lolly, no, I have to take Dirks. Ben ... (loud rock music playing) (laughing) We should have these parties more than once a month. I would, but Mina tends to get jealous. I love you, Chief, but if anybody should be jealous, it's you. (laughs) Who's that guy? Hey, Chief... I didn't know you were into guys, too. What guy? (two gunshots) Daddy? So, two nights ago, he has a party. High-end guest list, very private. That was the last anyone saw of him. Housekeeper arrives 20 minutes ago. This is what she found. Ex - Chief of Detectives. Left to make the big bucks. Consulting to the security at every major casino in town, and couldn't even protect himself. There's only one interpretation for this: "Kill the pig." And what about the rest of his family? No sign of the wife. What about the daughter? Housekeeper assume d that she spent the Assumed? She's gone. His wife and daughter are missing. His silver Cadillac DTS is also missing. We're looking for any signs of forced entry in the house, - any signs of ransack that's not associated We need serious damage control. When it's going to be bad for morale all around. - I'll take the downstairs. - Yeah, I'll be Looks execution - style. At least one shot to the back of the head. A lot of bruising around these handcuffs. So he probably fought back. Without a doubt. Found a shell casing. Looks like one of ours. Nine- millimeter, standard issue. So where do you suppose the chief keeps his gun safe? (drilling) We're in. Thank you, Scott. No problem. What do you got? .38. Nice. Pearl handle.25. Clear? I'm looking forthat.9. So you think the chief might've kept his signature piece someplace else? "For 25 years of distinguished service." An honor like that. Keep it in the case. Yeah. So I'm thinking that the wife might be in on this. Why didn't she plan better? Pack the kid's clothes. What? The nanny told me that she only took one shirt... one the kid wouldn't even wear. Security guard. No party list, but he did see each car that left the night of Chief Rittle left around 5:00 a.m. 5:14, to be exact. You saw Chief Rittle leave? Yeah. He was with his wife and kid. And he had his baseball cap and sunglasses on, like he always does. So you saw a baseball cap and sunglasses. (cell phone rings) Did you actually see the chief's face? Well... actually, I didn't. Brass found the chief's Cadillac. Who found it? In-house security. Blue jacket. First time he saw the car was Saturday. Chalk ed the tires twice. Saw the bulletin on the chief and called us. Any bodies, Joe? I already checked inside the car. We're waiting on you to check the trunk. (cell phone rings) Whoa. Excuse me. Who is this? "Chief Rittle"? What is his connection to the chief? I don't know. But, if he has gunpowder residue on him, could be our shooter. Okay. Florida Highway Patrol called. Several motorists saw a girl matching Sasha's exact physical walking along an access road. In Florida? Miami - Dade County. Chief was shot Friday night. It's a two-day drive if you don't stop. It's national news with national attention. I'm not surprised we're getting call-ins. Well, if it is our little girl, she's got evidence on her One of us should be down there to Take Warrick. I don't think he's ever been to Florida. She's seven years old! She's wearing a pink shirt! She was last seen see you tonight. No? No. I thought for sure you were going to take one of those inebriated young ladies for a ride South of the border. I thought about it. No, I really did. But then I thought... "I'd rather be home." Huh. Good job tonight. Thanks. You too. Got the option. Please. Previously on "Switched at birth"... You took home someone else's baby and another family took home yours. Does anybody know where this other child might be? I'm so glad you found it! - Who's my father? - The guy who took off when Daphne was little and hasn't been in touch since. Mom, this is Angelo Sorrento. - Hi. - Who are you again? - This is my father. - You are not welcome in Bay's life, - you have nothing to do with her! - We are playing East West Fest - in St. Louis. - Awesome! - Did you know my lawsuit is tanking? - No. - But I know something you don't. - And what's that? The nurse assigned to our babies that night worked 48 hours straight. There is one person who's always been there for me. Emmett. - Bye! - Road trip! You didn't want me to be with Liam, so I broke up with him. But I'm not giving up on Emmett. He's moving here. Angelo... he's moving to K.C. Moving. Is that right? Can you see me? Here. Okay, it's my conversation! There's a family meeting right now. Living room. Okay, give me a sec. I gotta go. But I miss you. Okay, we need to go ** some ground rules. Daphne, ground rules. Number one: he cannot come to this house. Number two: he can't be alone with Bay or Daphne. Number three: all phone calls with him will be monitored. - He's not on parole! - He is with me. I just want to say I had no idea that he was going to do this... I don't know why he has to be here at all. What do you want to do, ban him from the city? Girls, stop! I just don't understand why you can't do anything. - You don't have to see him. - You're not seriously going to hover - every single time I ** him... - Yes, I am! - I know nothing about this guy. - But Regina does! - Yes nothing she's said so far **. - I know him too. I'm happy to help. Anything you need from me, John. - Thank you, Adriana. - Mom, you're gonna give them the wrong impression about him. - I'm on John's side on this one. - So am I. - There are no sides! - Both: Oh, there are sides! Well, he invited to a jazz club and I'm not canceling. Fine, make it a table for three. Because I'm coming. ♪ Go-ooo ♪ ♪ But she gonna get melted ♪ ♪ She's pretty, but she's pretty, oh! ♪ ♪ And she gonna get... ♪ There's something wrong here. We're supposed to open for the cold war kids. They wouldn't put the cold war kids way out here. Yeah, uh, about that. - Wilke? - Now before you freak out. Dude, you tricked me to get us out here? ! - That is not cool, man. - We will open for the cold war kids someday. - Just not this weekend. - Why do I unstop believing your crap? ! We're not opening for the cold war kids. Uh, we're not... Hey, relax! We are playing. We've got a perfectly good stage here. - We've got... - We've got a terrible time slot! We're playing up against Arcade Fire. No one's going to trek out to Siberia when Arcade Fire's playing on the freaking main stage! Kennish, get a hold of yourself. It's good experience. It's great exposure, plus the sun is shining. We've got music, hemp bracelets, corn dogs. ** and see the bright side. - Okay? - "D" stage. You really believed we had the spot for the cold war kids? Yeah. Man, I'm better than I thought. Hi. Come in. Daphne, um, this just came out in closed caption. It contains "The unedited convent massacre scene." I didn't know you liked horror movies. I haven't seen one since I was your age. "Amityville horror." And it wasn't nearly as scary as the boy I saw it with. So Toby's gone, and Bay's, you know, out, so I just thought that you and me, we could watch a movie. Together? Eat caramel popcorn, nuns with chainsaws. Wreeee! - What do you think? - Sure yeah, we could do that. Yay! Okay, I'll see you. Thanks, I can never get the right hand it's always a disaster. Perfect. So it looks like my dad was actually serious about tagging along tonight. He's just being protective. It's humiliating. Like I'm five years old. I mean, how Angelo and I are supposed to get to know each other if my dad is just sitting there glaring at him? - He's not going to do that. - Then what's the point? Angelo's not gonna kidnap me, you know that. So can you tell my dad that is unfair and unnecessary and kind of creepy? This is between you and John. I can't interfere. Okay, Daphne gets access to my dad every single day, but I have to schedule time through my parents? And then they're monitoring him like he's in prison. How is that fair? I just don't think my opinion matters much to anyone, especially your dad. Can you at least try? Hi, Amanda. I wasn't expecting you. John's not here, he's at the office. Look, that nurse... the one Angelo found... She's willing to meet with us next week to go over her story. So she's sticking with it... that the hospital forced her to work a double shift? - Apparently. - So that's good, right, - for our case? - Kathryn, I know John wants this to be true. We all want it to be true. But I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't tell you my gut says there's something fishy about it. She's a single mom on a nurse's salary, if Angelo promised her a cut of a multimillion-dollar lawsuit for providing key testimony... That would be hard for anyone to turn down. Well, then we'll find out when we speak with her next week. We will. I just think we need to walk into that meeting as skeptically as possible... all of us. - Of course. - I want to make sure your voice is heard... - if you had a different opinion. - Well, my husband and I - have equal voices when it comes to this lawsuit. - Good. Here's her file. Read it through and I'll see you monday. Hi. Hey! Everything okay? - Are the girls okay? - Yeah. I just actually have this coupon for 10% off. But I think it might be expired. - I think I can help you with that. - Perfect. Um, okay, uh, look, I know that you are worried about Bay, but I think if you insist on tagging along every time she's with Angelo, it's just going to make things uncomfortable. And make her resentful... of you. And I would hate to see that happen. He's already hurt Daphne. I'm just trying to protect Bay. I get it. I just think that Bay is old enough that she has to form her own opinion of him. And you and I both need to give her the space to do that. I'd just feel better if somebody was there. Will you go? Hey. I'm making eggplant parmesan tonight. Do you want a salad too? Actually, nothing for me. Instead of John going to that club with Bay and Angelo, I'm going. What is this, a date? - Of course not. - I don't understand. How can you encourage Bay to get to know him when you know who he is? Wait, I think I might have painted too harsh a portrait of him. What does that mean? You said he walked out when I went deaf. Well, he doesn't see it that way. You've talked about this? ! For a second. Honey, it's complicated. There were good years. You're completely changing your story! Okay, I know it sounds like that... It's like he brainwashed you or something. Or Bay did. I tried to keep it simple because I thought it would be better for you, and now I see it might have been a mistake. Oh, and suddenly he is this great guy and you're gonna go dancing with him. - It's not like that. - I don't want you to see him! Why can't you just tell Bay no? - You know why. - No, I don't. Because I'm her mother too. - Guitar Face, tomorrow at 2:00! - Toby: Guitar Face! Hey. Guitar Face newest alt pop sensation in K.C. - Check it out, "D" stage. - Guitar Face... acid metal. - Guitar Face! - Guitar Face... best K.C. ska, man. Guitar face, indie rock from K.C.! You guys are not indie rock. You're garage pop, at best. Simone Sinclair! How are you? - Good. - Hey, you want to help us hand some of these out? I did not drive all the way out here to help you pass out your stickers. I'm sorry. Oh, come on. - hey. - hey, Toby. I didn't know you were gonna be here. I didn't know you were going to be here. Simone, this is Emmett. Emmett, this is Simone. Hello. Nice to meet you. Emmett is actually Bay's... Can I say? - Boyfriend. - Oh, no kidding. Simone is one of Bay's... good friends. Well, used to be good friend... or... So I've been meaning to ask you guys, "Guitar Face"... what is that all about? It's the term my mom made up to describe my face when I'm playing. We couldn't name ourselves "Bass Face" because that just sounds stupid. Right. What is the face? Nice. So where you guys playing? I'm gonna come check you out. - The "D" stage. - Oh, ouch. - Exactly. - That's a hike, huh? - No, it's not that bad. - It's Timbuktu. All right, I gotta run. Helen Mirren's cleavage is playing. And now they are indie rock. Okay, so is this like too much? Or too weird? Oh, honey, you don't have to impress him. Mom, didn't you want Daphne to think you were cool when you guys met? Yeah, but he's not going to be judging you. You're his... daughter. - Mom. - You're not gonna call him "Dad," are you? - Mom! - You're not wearing that. Okay, I'll just... I'll take it off. No, I'm talking about the whole "Studs aplenty" belted leather micro... Oh, he's not gonna look at me like that. He's my dad. - You know what I mean. - Yeah. - I think you look fantastic, honey. - Yeah yes. And if you need me, you text me. - I won't need you. - Mm-hmm. - Hi. - Oh wow, you look beautiful. Oh, uh... I wasn't trying to. I mean, it's a club. That's what you're supposed to wear. Okay, let's go. - Guitar Face. - Check us out. Tomorrow at 2:00. Sweet. I know... $7 beer, crazy, right? But check out this line. These dudes are cleaning up. We should change our names to "Free Booze." So that way when they announce our band, it's "Free Booze on the 'D' stage!" Wilke, no. It's seriously the smartest thing you have ever said. No, it's false advertising. They'll stone us off the stage. They'll laugh and then we'll win them over with our sound! - This is a terrible idea. - No no. Don't listen to whatever he is going to write. That's a bad idea. Hi. Gina, I didn't know you were coming. No no, just pretend I'm not here. I am just chaperoning. This is your night. The two of you. I am not gonna say a word. - Hi. - Hi. - Beautiful necklace. - Oh thanks. Look at us... a family. Um... I'm starving. - Oh, you're going to so much trouble. - Oh no, I love it. Do you wanna help? I was going to see if you wouldn't mind if we took a rain check. - Oh. - The boys are playing at the festival tomorrow. I was going to drive out there tonight in my new car. And I could really use some time alone right now. Oh. Okay. - Are you mad? - No. No no no, of course not. And plus Emmett's up there. I just wanted to check in on him. Do you know how to get there? Do you need anything? Gas? - Money? - I'm fine. My mom asked all the same questions. And I'll just crash with Emmett or Toby. Well, drive safe. And text me when you get there. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, did you want to take... Your mom ate the crabcakes here by the dozen when she was pregnant with you. I was afraid you were going to come out with eight legs. So you guys came here a lot? Yeah, there was this horn player that was completely obsessed with her. What was his name? - Zeke? Zeb? - Zane. - Zane. - And it was only because you were always late that he came by so much. She was stunning back then. Back then? Gina, you're still gorgeous. Enough about the old times. I want to hear about you. Boyfriend? Girlfriend? Uh, boyfriend. It's this guy, his name's Emmett. - Emmett? - Mm-hmm. Wait, Daphne's Emmett? He doesn't really belong to her. No, of course not. Wow, I... I never would have guessed that. But I'm happy for you. - Thanks. - Oh, thank you. It's the pinot. Wanna try? Um, I don't drink anymore. Oh right. Bay told me. I forgot. Bay told you and you forgot? I guess I never saw you as the A.A. type. - What type is that? - You know... the rules, the meetings, the "Higher power," you know? It's not really you. - What can I say? - I... Sorry, um... - can you take it back? - No no! It's fine, it's fine. I'm around it all the time. She says she doesn't mind, but she really minds. If I say I don't mind, I don't mind. Okay, this is a test. She does that. And then if I don't send it back, she will say I've being selfish. What are you talking about? Don't tell me you don't remember all those times you were telling me it's okay - for me to go out... - If I say something, it's true. You don't have to question it. Look where that got us. Excuse me. Excuse me. Daphne really likes this? I don't know. Maybe Regina likes horror movies. Maybe it was like a thing in their house. Whoa. Sometimes it's just so obvious that we didn't raise her. Come on, we raised Toby. He's doing things all the time that make me wonder how the hell he's related to me. - Whew. - I just wish that when she was upset, she'd want to be with us. Well, gee, go to rock festival or stay home with the parents? What would I have done? It's all because of that Angelo. He barges into our lives and suddenly there's all this chaos. I can't believe that our lives are tangled up with that woman and all of her mistakes. Wow. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. No, it's all right. Hey, we're meeting that nurse on monday... 3:00 P.M. - John... - Brizia Mun... is it Brizia or Britzia? You do remember what our lawyer told us, right? Whatever. I can't wait to shake that woman's hand. If that nurse is lying and we sign on to a false document, we could go to jail. Sweetie, I looked over the affidavit. It looks very credible to me. So what do you say we turn this off, and go read instead? Okay then. So I'm sure that was strange for you. He just pushes these buttons with me and I lose it... which I'm not proud of. I don't know if you're like that with anyone, but... anyway, if you want to do that again... Maybe I can ask my mom to come. Right. So why didn't you tell me about you and Emmett? I don't know. I guess I just assumed Daphne told you. Daphne knows? Of course. Besides it's not exactly like you and I tell each other everything. Right. I better go. Good night. Night. Hey, sweetie. You okay? Yeah, dad, I am okay. Angelo called. He wants to take you to the Kemper tomorrow. I guess everything went great, huh? - I guess. - I know your mom's busy tomorrow. Maybe Adriana can take you. Or you could just lojack my phone - or chip me like a dog. - Hey. Dad, just admit you're trying to make it hard on me to see him. No, I am trying to do my job as your father. Okay, I'm going to bed. I assume this means you do not want to go to the Kemper tomorrow, right? - Right. - Maybe you'd like to spend the day with me? Actually, Toby just texted me. He really wants me to go out there and support him. So I think I'm just gonna head out tomorrow morning. I wish I'd known, I would've had Daphne wait for you. What? Daphne went out to the East West thing tonight. Why? I don't know. To see Emmett, I guess. Whoa. What's going on? Uh, dude, you're with Bay. Daphne, what are you doing? Nothing. I just came to talk to him. It's 7:00 in the morning, you're coming out of his tent. It was late. I was tired. You know what, forget it. This was the stupidest idea. I don't know what I was thinking. - Hey, stop. - I can't believe you think I'm the type of girl who would sleep with someone else's boyfriend. Okay, I'm sorry, okay? I overreacted. It's just wired in or something. I'm just so protective of Bay. She's my little sister, what can I say? Oh. Right. It doesn't matter. I'm going anyway. Stop. Come on, we're playing today. You gotta come watch us. Please? For your big brother? Ms. Munoz? Are you Ms. Munoz? - Yeah? - My name is Kathryn Kennish. I had a baby here 16 years ago. You said you were working here that night. I can't talk to you here. Surprise! I missed you. Well, hey! Hey! Oh yeah, I heard you were coming here! I thought I should stop by. If it's a party, I should come too. Just came to support the guys. Just couldn't stay away, could you? I remember everything about that day... the seahorse wallpaper, the cranberry juice and the nurse who took care of me. She was indian. I am sure of that. Then I'm sure you recall that when you deliver a baby, - you have more than one nurse. - Yes, I do. But I don't remember you. Well I can't control what you remember, but I was there. Please! Get in. I remember being a new mom and being so sleep-deprived that I couldn't even mix a bottle. If I was in charge of medication or I.D. bracelets... I'm sure you would've done a much better job than me. Look, I just don't understand why you didn't say no. Have you ever depended on a job? Because it's easy to judge from inside of a Mercedes. And I wasn't Norma Rae. You were taking care of infants. You had a responsibility to tell them if it wasn't safe to do your job... It probably wasn't even me! I am doing the right thing by coming forward now. It's a little late, don't you think? You were having trouble nursing. You said it was your first time because your son was born with a cleft and couldn't latch. - How do you know that? - You told me. We had that fixed when he was six weeks old. We didn't tell anyone. But wait... you must have had hundreds of patients... How do you remember me? I was living at home then and your husband was a big deal to my parents, especially my dad. He wanted details... what was he like? What were you like? He was a baseball star. So I made sure to hold the baby so I'd have something to tell them. I remember taking her into the nursery and wondering what kind of life she'd have. You were so pretty and sweet. And she would have everything and it would be an easy life. I was kind of jealous of a one-day-old. I know. I know it was silly. I remember putting her in her crib. And I thought it was the right one, but I was so tired. And I just... I remember being so tired. If it was me, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Bay: So we all go out to this jazz club and it goes from a family reunion to like a total meltdown in like three seconds. Apparently I am the spawn of not one hothead, but two. - You're up. - What can I get for you, my man? All right, you want green tomatillo or red chile sauce? Tomatillo or chile, man? What's it gonna be, green or red? Hey, green or red? What's it gonna be? I got a line here. You guys are hungry, aren't you? You know, he'll just take the green. Great, green. There we go. Here you go, my man. Appreciate it. $4. There we go. More chips, more chips. Come on, let's go. What can I get for you, my man? - What's up, East West Fest? - Whoo-hoo! All right, thanks for coming out, guys! We are Free Booze. - Free Booze! - Whoo! Yeah, it's the name of our band. Kinda funny. Okay. Oh, hey hey! No no, we've got a great set for you guys. We've got a great set. Let's get it going. We want beer! We want beer! ♪ What cold, in spite of achings ♪ ♪ I wouldn't know you now ♪ ♪ anyway ♪ ♪ there's nothing left to keep breaking ♪ ♪ we had a life together ♪ ♪ we made a big mistake, oh! ♪ Hi. Oh, sorry, bowl. Sorry. Kathryn? I went to meet that nurse Brizia today. What are you talking about? We're going to go see her on monday. I know. I'm sorry, I... just I went... Wait a second. You went and saw her? Without me? You hid this from me? I wanted to meet her myself and make up my own mind. You know sometimes you railroad me, John. I railroad you? I don't... I don't mean to. I know. I need to learn how to speak up for myself. So what happened? She's telling the truth. - She remembers us. - This is great. No... well, maybe, but... I guess I was hoping that she was lying, and that we would find out that Angelo had bribed her. Why? You know, when we found out about the girls being switched I was never as angry as you, you know that. And I think it's because I just thought that it was meant to be. That it was... God's plan or something. To bring us to Bay... To make us all stronger or something. But it was none of those things. It was just a big hospital trying to save a little money. I know. Those sons of bitches. The good news is that the people who stayed are your hardcore fans. Hey, I know you! You're the drummer from that band that sucked! Hey, buddy, I was promised a drink! Whoa, he is deaf, you moron. Leave him alone. Seriously? I said you were deaf. You bailed after like two seconds. Were we that bad? So what's the deal? I thought Edward had a thing for you. Emmett. Whatever. He's with Bay now. He's happy. Uh-huh. So you're out here staring out into the water all alone because you're so happy he's happy? I got a couple other things going on. I'm listening. It's okay. What, no smart comment? You got a shoulder for me to lean on. Or abs or some other body part? I really am listening. You know how there are some people that love you so much every time you think about them, you get happy? And then there are others that even the tiniest reminder brings you down? That's my dad. I hate even thinking about him. And he just moved back here, right? I hate Bay for wanting to get to know him. I hate my parents for not being able to stop it. And I hate more than anything that I can't even talk to the one person that I would normally talk to about all this because Bay took him. So I'm just sitting on this beautiful dock on this beautiful day hating the entire world. Aren't you glad you asked? Yeah, I am. I wish I could just turn my brain off for a second. You know, just... Can I see your hearing aids? - What? - Can you just take them out? Okay, but it doesn't turn off my brain, only my ears. Wilke, I'm gonna kill you! - Did it work? - I can't hear you. - Did it work? - Get in here now! All right, I'm coming. What would have happened if I couldn't swim? ! Well, I guess I'd have to save you. I'm sorry, okay? I was scared and I didn't know what to do. Okay, which part bothers you? The hearing or the girl? You may have had this happen before, but I haven't. And you cannot get mad at me for not knowing what to do! But as a sales hook it's okay? You didn't care when Wilke sold you guys as the band with the deaf drummer. So how am I supposed to know the rules? I will. Okay, I have another question. The tamales? I know that you were mad that I ordered for you, but I was just trying to help. And why is that not okay... to help? Excuse me. Pointing and texting and gesturing is how I connect to the world. So that guy had to stop and figure out how to engage with me without talking. So what? He'll survive. If he's uncomfortable with me, that's his problem. But most people aren't. They figure it out. I'm different. It's okay. Okay. I wish we didn't need Daphne. Not really. Wilke's making fart jokes and there's some drunk girls over there. They're being idiots. What do you mean? Yeah. It actually does. Who were you talking to? Um, just a client. She wanted to reschedule. You were on for a long time. I knocked. Yeah, um, she just kept going on and on about her boyfriend. It was Louise. I just wanted to talk through some things. He's here 48 hours and you're on the phone with your sponsor. - It's not a big deal. - And what did she say? Mom, I really don't want to get into this right now. I know what she said. You're supposed to ask yourself "Is this situation going to" "take me closer or farther away from a drink?" And when we're talking about you and Angelo... That was a long time ago. Because you've got two girls to think about now. I am not gonna start drinking again. Okay? Hey, um, so how did it go with Angelo and my mom? It was incredibly weird. What do you mean? Okay, so this is what life would've been like, but not really, 'cause everything just got totally screwed up and we will never really know. And no matter how hard we try, or which family we are in, it still feels like all screwy. Or at least it does for me. Did you get any of that at all? Yeah.

Because of a certain incident in Seoul, I left on a boat. You might find it difficult to understand, but a mutiny happened on the ship. People were being thrown into the sea. It was such a mess. I thought I'd die for sure. But at that time, I suddenly thought of my Rolex. So, I had to sell it. One thing lead to another, I ended up here, and my employee was nowhere to be found. But suddenly you appeared out of thin air. Isn't this fate? I believe this is fate. So? Perhaps you can let me borrow some money for food. I remember I've told you before, I don't have money to loan to a person like you. Come out here! What are you doing? Come out here, you asshole. Let go! This is embarrassing. Embarrassing? Security! Security! Do you want to know what real embarrassment is? Do you want to see it? Let go of your hand first! Hey, I only wanted to borrow some money for food. You refused even that? I don't want to have dinner with you either. If you were also starving like me, I would like to see how you could manage! Hey! Let him go! What is this? Let go! I'll go! I'll go! He's my friend. My high school friend. You'll be dead if I ever run into you again. Okay, I'll go. Good-bye everybody. You don't have money to loan to a person like me? Do you even know what kind of person I am? You'll be dead for sure, if I ever see you again! It's not a big deal. No problem. Sit down. You think you really are that good, asshole? Good fortune doesn't last forever. Thank you, asshole. Michael? -=Everlasting love, Anna.=- Everlasting love? Hey! Asshole! Stop right there, you asshole! Stop! Help me! Help me! Stop! =The mastermind behind the riot on the fishing boat is a Korean.= =Yes, the leader for this time's incident has been identified as a Korean named Gang Yeong Geol.= =It is said that he used to own a clothing business in the Dongdaemun market.= =He disappeared, leaving behind a huge amount of debt.= =It is believed that= =Mr. Gang targeted the ship from the beginning and deliberately incited the mutiny.= You might find it difficult to understand, but a mutiny happened on the ship. Also, one of my employees is currently studying here. You know this school, right? What are you doing? Come on! Come on, let's go! Hello President. This is Ga Yeong. I apologize for not contacting you sooner. I gave you a call after I got here, but I heard that you were out of town. Did your business trip go well? It's thanks to you that I finally was able to attend school here. There was a minor dispute in the beginning, but everything is settled now. However, that small incident has helped me get to know a lot of people. Some people even gave me money. I am doing very well here and it's all thanks to you. I am very fortunate to be able to know you. Although our time together was short, everybody's been treating me very nicely. Those ajummas in the factory, and you too. I will never forget that. Come and visit me whenever you have time. I will take you guys out for a nice dinner. I will write again soon. Lee Ga Yeong. Lucky for me. Made in Italy. Hello President. Lee Ga... -=This is the president. The school...=- Ga Yeong, Lee Ga Yeong, where are you? President! Is it really you, president? What took you so long to show up? I've almost gone crazy trying to find you. It's the third room with the light on. Over there? It's not bad. But, are you serious about wanting to sleep here? Why? What's wrong with that? Didn't we also live together at the factory? I have no problem with that, but my roommate is a bit sensitive. You have a roommate? A man? No. Well, then there's no problem. Want to have something to drink? Let's go! Let's go! -=The mastermind behind the fishing boat mutiny is a Korean named Gang Yeong Geol.= =His main purpose for boarding the ship was nothing but money.=- Looks like they haven't caught this bastard. It says that he used to own a store in Dongdaemun. Don't tell me he's Ga Yeong's boss. Please come in. Excuse me. This is my landlord. Hello. Oh, hello. This is my boss from Seoul. It's a pleasure to meet you. You have a nice place. How much is the monthly rent here? It seems like you just arrived after a long trip from somewhere. Why don't you take a shower first? Yes. The mutiny happened on a fishing boat in the South Pacific, where he managed to escape death, and then ate out of a trashcan. Why is he looking for you? There's really nothing going on between the two of you? Is it purely a relationship between a factory boss and his female employee? Yes. Is he married? No. So? It's not like you two have committed adultery. He really came all the way here just to look for his female employee? Where have I heard this story before? It sounds so familiar. Mutiny on a ship, business in the fashion industry, Dongdaemun... Maybe... Do you have clean clothes? I know. The number of Hallyu stars with that kind of physique can be counted on your fingers. Do you think I have the heart to do this? It's so difficult because I don't have the heart. But having a good figure and breaking the law are two separate things. Call the police immediately. I don't think that's the case. You believe him then? Please give us a few days' time. I promise I won't give you any trouble. This is not Korea. Things have gotten to this state. Do you really think he will get away with it without a lawyer? Do you have enough money to hire a lawyer? It's very possible we'd be dragged into this and get kicked out. Now that you're finally able to attend school, do you really want to give up everything and go home? If you can't, I'll do it for you. If you really insist, then I'll move out with him. What? Please give me a few days. I promise I won't give you any trouble. How are you? I am being re-admitted to school. So? So, I come here to express my gratitude. Thank you. If you have time, I would like to invite you to a dinner. When is the best time for you? How about tonight? What? Then, may I please have your business card? I will contact you again about the time and location. Then, goodbye. What's this? I think it's the money from last time. This shirt has your initials on it. It looks like a present for you. Welcome to the restaurant. Lee Ga Yeong. What is it? You seem startled to see me here. What are you doing here? I heard that you wanted to buy dinner for Jae Hyeok oppa. Oppa said he would have felt awkward, so that's why he asked me to come instead. Is that okay with you? But how could you pick a place like this? I don't have money to pay for your meal. What are you plotting? Just because he helped you once or twice, you mistakenly thought it was some kind of destiny. I'm not you. Anyway, you're not my opponent. Jae Hyeok Oppa is mine, so don't get any ideas. So what if I get some ideas? What? In my eyes, you're not my opponent. Now I know why my mom hates you so much. Sorry, I'm late. Why didn't you say anything about that? You are quite shameless. How could you go to some stranger and ask for his help? Even oppa thinks it's absurd. So, where do you live? Somewhere in this neighborhood. How big is it? It's quite small. You live alone? No. What's the monthly rent? Why? You want to move me to a hotel? If it's really not that comfortable, I can move you to a hotel. It's very normal to help a female employee who is having a hard time. Should I tell mom to move you to a hotel? Would that be okay? I want to ask you one thing. Perhaps you know Gang Yeong Geol. Yes or no? I know him. Who is Gang Yeong Geol? Is he your boss? Yes. How do you know our President? Who is Gang Yeong Geol? Have you two met? It's also because of that that I came to see you. Sounds like you've met him. How do you know my boss? Where is he right now? Is he with you? No, he's not. Perhaps you know some people at the embassy? The embassy? I believe you and those people from the embassy should... Do you not understand or are you too full of yourself? What makes you think I'd say yes? Just because I helped you with your admission, you really think I am your problem solver? I'm sorry. If you really want to show your gratitude to me, then you should pay more attention to your behavior. Cheers. - Yes, thank you. - The scenery has really gotten much better here. - Can I? - Yes, please. Yes. Right here! Whoa, so cute. Why? Nice to meet you. - What's your... - Look at the muscles. Such a cutie. Sexy man. Me? Cute? I'm single. You are? You and me? What's your name? - Cindy. - Cindy? - What's your name? - My Name is Yeong--Yeong Geol. Thank you. It's all right. I should have done that for you. Hello? What? Police? There is no such a person here. Gang Yeong Geol doesn't contact you? How many times have you asked the same question? I already said no. Aish... Ajumma, do you really think this is a common crime? Mutiny plus murder. Smuggling and theft. Ajumma, if you don't tell the truth you will be in trouble. Did he call? Who is Lee Ga Yeong? Why ask about Ga Yeong all of the sudden? Those two people have been communicating with each other through email. What kind of relationship do they have? What do you mean by relationship? Are those two dating? She's not our boss' type. Type or no type, it's too crowded in this factory. Two unmarried people of the opposite sex, together every night. It would be strange if nothing ever happened. That's true. Not long after she left, our boss went missing. Ga Yeong called just after our boss when missing. She was looking for him. In other words, that lady and Gang Yeong Geol are involved in some kind of relationship. Isn't that right? Do you have her contact number? Rent is due at the end of the month. And gas and electricity are separate. Okay. - Here you go. - Thank you, and here's your keys. - Thank you. - Bye-bye. - Bye. I know you don't have much money. I'm sorry. Without the dorm, I still have some money from the internship. So, it should be okay. Plus some allowance. That's not bad. But it's not enough to cover two people. It's not? I don't think so. Ga Yeong, when I was sleeping on the street, I came up with an idea. You asleep? You two seem to have a nice life. Ever since I got that phone call from the cop, my heart has been beating so fast that I can't get a good night's sleep. I am sorry, eonni. You have everything you need? Where did you get this from? You want some tea? Never mind about the tea. Do you make enough to get by? Let me tell you the truth. Since you left, those ajummas can't seem to stop complaining. There is no way I can handle that all by myself. So, I'm going to give you some pos. pos? I'll be responsible for sales, raw material, and accessories. You will only be responsible for designing and sewing. We'll split it 80:20. You bad girl. By the way, where is your boss? You want to try? Mister, you want to try? Did you make this? Yeah, sure. - Actually, I made this. - What? Why do you mess around with my clothes? Hey, this is mine. Not yours. If you want this jacket, you must buy, okay? Come see me anytime. You'll hear some good news. Didn't even buy any clothes but still put on an act. We don't know yet. What is it then? It's Bong Su eonni's order. Finish it up and go to bed. You still need to go to school tomorrow. Yes. Do you know Director Jeong Jae Hyeok by any chance? - Who? - Jeong Jae Hyeok. What about him? He seems to know you well. How do you know that asshole? I just know him. You're quite good. You even know the son of a wealthy family. You two know each other well? So what if we do? He must know a lot of important people. What if you go and ask for his help in person? Did you go to see him? You think he's an idiot? You know nothing! But you can't be held responsible for something you didn't do. Whether I was being framed or being crapped on, what's that got to do with you? When did I ask you to do something like that? Just because I live off you, you think I have no right to even get upset anymore? An asshole like him thinks I'm not worth being alive. Understand? I don't think he is that kind of person. He's not that kind of person? Why? Is he hitting on you? No, it's nothing like that. If not, then what kind of relationship is it? I said it's nothing like that. Fine. If you think I'm such a nuisance, you can just tell me that. I'll disappear from your life. You'll hear some good news. Michael J... Yeong Geol has arrived. Okay, copy that. Someone will assist you right through those doors. - Right down there. - Thank you. Thank you. Welcome, kind sir. Come on in! Can I please take your coat? Your jacket. - Jacket? - Don't be shy. Come on. Good job! Good job! Good job! Alright, now... Don't be afraid to take a bath. Enjoy your little snacks. Enjoy the view. Bye-bye now. Thank you. You have the final pics? Make sure you have them. I would have sent it already if I were you. Get out! What? Come out so I can see you. I don't have time for this. You don't understand? Come out! What's your height? Your height? How tall? 180. Why is it that all good-looking men are gay? I'm not gay. Hello. You speak Korean. Are you a Korean? If you're not gay, then what are you doing here? I am also very curious about that too. What is it then? Huh? What is it? What is what? Aren't you here to see Michael? That's right. But you're not gay? That's right. Then why did you say your name was Yeong Geol? Yeong Geol means hero. So, Yeong Geol is my name. Yeong Geol. Are you a model? No. Then what do you do? I'm in the same business. Hey, it's me. He said he's not gay. Find another one and take him to the party ASAP. I don't know. He says he's not gay. I think there was a misunderstanding here. So, get out of here! What? Wait... Hey! What the hell is she doing? You found one? Then keep looking. Let me help you with the zipper. Thank you. Can you leave now? Are you going to a party? You really have no manners. Didn't you treat me the same way too? Didn't I say it was a misunderstanding? Can't you see I'm busy? You're the only one busy? So? What do you want? Let me see the person I came to see. That's all I want. Not only did I not get to see him, I had to take a bath too? You asked me to get out of the tub while I was naked. What's all that? Do you have an appointment? He said I could come anytime. I don't know why he asked you to come, but we have an important party tonight. So, there's no way you can see him. Please make an appointment and come again next time. Now, may I ask you to leave? Look, miss... I'm here because of these clothes, not other things. Are you that ignorant that you don't even notice? He gave me a business card and asked me to stop by. That's why. Have you ever been on TV or in a magazine before? Nope. You look so familiar for some strange reason. But I think you really are something. I didn't expect a well-known world class designer would employ a Korean. You must be making a lot of money. What do you do in order to get in to a place like this? Did you take an entrance exam? People who work at such a place should be on TV or the internet. That's what national prestige means. A person who works side by side with people of such an international brand, is a true patriot. Your looks and body are better than others'. As a Korean, I am really proud of you. Please wait here! Hey Michael, I want to introduce you to my friend. He's a successor of Korea's leading fashion brand. He's a big donor to our annual scholarship fund. And he will be also opening up a brand in the US. Oh, really? Hello, I'm Jae Hyeok Jeong. It's an honor to meet you. Your work is always very impressive. Enjoy yourself! Have a lovely evening. He must be busy. You... What are you doing here? None of your business. What kind of place do you think this is? Why? A person like me isn't fit to be at a place like this? I don't think you can come in and wander around here. Don't embarrass our country by doing stupid things here. I think you have misunderstood. I'm here to look for someone. Is that so? You're not here to pick pockets? What? Asshole! Mr. Gang Yeong Geol, Michael wants to see you. That asshole. What does he take me for? Do you know him? That bastard? No, I don't. Do you? -=Everlasting love, Anna.=- Everlasting love, Anna. It's nothing. Yeong Geol. Come in, come in. You should've cleaned up a bit. Look at the mess at our workplace. What are you doing? Say hello. How are you? She is my assistant. Don't underestimate her. She was accepted to the NFS on full scholarship. Is that so? You want something to drink? Is this your work studio? Yes. As I have mentioned earlier, I have a huge factory in Dongdaemun. This is an overseas marketing department. Or you can say this is our overseas RD department. Did you make all of these yourself? Actually my expertise is MD. I've gotten a lot of experience in Dongdaemun. You'll know when you see it. These stitches here are no regular stitches. Since my assistant, Miss Lee Ga Yeong, has such a remarkable stitching skills, that's why it's possible. You heard of Zegna, haven't you? You can only find such skills at major labels such as Zegna and Brioni. Ga Yeong, show her. - That's enough. - Stop! Anyway, Michael is very interested. I'll take a few samples with me. Ah... yes. What's your phone number? Ph-phone number? Phone number. Wait, wait! 758... If you're on a scholarship, you don't need to worry about finding a job later. Is he your husband? No, he's not! We are boss and employee. Here's the phone number. I'm sorry to stop by at such a late hour. Goodbye. I'll give you a call soon. Let me! I'll see you out. You came all the way here because of me. Shall we go for a drink? Please be careful. Drive carefully! I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Who is she? Ga Yeong, You haven't eaten any meat since you arrived in the US, have you? From now on, you'll have meat everyday. But tonight, I need a drink. Do you have money? No. Miss Anna is really cool. Ga Yeong, you must be successful like her. Actually, I'm here to borrow some money. Do you have 30 000 Won? In other words, you don't have it? Whether before or now, you don't have 30 000? You might find it difficult to understand, but a mutiny happened on the ship. It's also because of that that I came to see you. Michael wants to see you. You haven't eaten any breakfast, have you? You still haven't given me an answer to my question the other day. Are you doing all this because you feel guilty or... because you really need me? Both. Do you think it's even possible? I was too young back then. And now? Now I have the ability to protect you. Is that so? Then, how about taking a picture of us sitting together here, and sending it back to prove it? Why not? Never mind. This is my answer. How do you know him? Gang Yeong Geol. Because of your curiosity you came to find me this early in the morning? What kind of work are Gang Yeong Geol and Michael planning to do? They seem to know each other pretty well. If you're curious, why don't you ask them yourself? Let's have a fresh start. Wipe your mouth. I did. I said I called. He'll be here in a minute. Tell them to wait, okay? I got to go. It's been a while. Although I know that you didn't plan to appear in front of Director Jeong on purpose, I think you know Director Jeong is still young. When it comes to certain things, the elders are quite worried about him because of his reckless character. He has a bright future ahead of him. Personally, I don't have even the slightest hard feelings toward you. But I work for his family, so this is something I have to do. If you accept Director Jeong's offer, I'm sure you know better than me what would happen. You are a very capable person. If it is possible at all, I would like to help you find an even better job in Paris or anywhere else in the world. Thank you for your kindness. Many thanks for taking me into consideration. I believe you will make as wise a decision as you did last time. Lord, how embarrassing. My God! At such a young age. How did she get involved with such a lowlife? So embarrassing. According to our investigation, it's very possible that Gang Yeong Geol takes shelter at that lady's residence. I told you I know nothing. In that case, that lady could be deported for sheltering and aiding a criminal. Whether she got deported or evicted, I really don't... Did you just say deported? That's right. Considering the seriousness of the crime, she could also be arrested as an accomplice. She could be arrested? Wait a minute. Although I can't get a hold of her directly, that doesn't mean there is no other way. Wait a minute. What time is it over there now? Jeong A? Ga Yeong... Ga Yeong... Done with classes? Where are you going now? Home? Great! Where do you live? I'll give you a ride. Why? What do you mean, why? I just want to give you a ride home. No, thanks. I can take the subway. Let's have a chat about school life. Neither of us have any friends. I have a lot of friends. No need to lie, girl! Are you still mad at me about last time? You know how much I like Jae Hyeok oppa. That's why I behaved like that. Please understand me. I'm truly sorry, okay? Where do you live? Don't you have keys? Who's in there? A roommate? Yes. A woman or a man? Who is it? I'm home! Hello. This is my first time coming to this ghetto neighborhood. Ghetto? Can I look around? Well, what's there to see in a tiny apartment in the ghetto? Isn't it a bit too small for two people? Are you a designer? Which school did you go to? I just want to know if you're my sunbaenim. You're so lucky to be able to recall the past. The atmosphere here is not much different from the factory in Cheongdam-dong. Are you looking for something? No. Thank you for the hospitality. I'm leaving. Come and visit me when our house is done being renovated. I'm leaving. Bye. What? What is it? Nothing. Goodbye. A young lady with no manners. Who is she? What did she mean by a factory in Cheongdam-dong? Is everything okay? Yes. You want to come and stay here for a while? It's quite boring living by myself. Could it be you've fallen for that guy? I told you I haven't. Anyway, just do as you wish. I'm leaving. Do you have any orders for me? You really have a tough life. You have to go to school and work. That's why they say, a woman needs to find herself a decent man. I'm sorry! I'm really sorry! Hello? Come on, Danielle, bring me those shoes! Let's go! Let's go! Hustle people. Let's try the belt on her. No. Those shoes are definitely not gonna work. Switch them! Nice of you to show up. Here's our princess. Alright, let's try the red hat, no, red hat on her. And not the belt on her. Why are we insisting on having such an average day, people? Did you not understand what I've told you? How dare you bring this cheap piece of shit? You really think this is my taste? Bring a new set! Okay, Michael. Let's take a break! My employees must have misunderstood you because your name is "young girl". I apologize for making you shower without any explanations. Never mind. No problem. Don't care. I like shower. I'll probably remember your name for the rest of my life. Thank you. So, where did you study fashion? Study? Dongdaemun? Do you know Dongdaemun? Dongdaemun? Dongdaemun is number one fashion market in Korea. Anyways uhmm... The samples you sent me are pretty impressive. Really? Thank you. So, I was thinking about buying your design. What? I would like to buy your talent. Buy my talent? No. No, not Young Girl. Yeong--Geol. 50:50. 70:30. 60:40. Who? takeover! Wall Street! takeover! Wall Street! takeover! Wall Street! Okay, just take it easy. Just take it easy. You've reached detective Madsen. Please leave a message. Damn it. Okay. Okay. All right, pick up. Pick up. Come on, pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Doc's comics, go for Chet... Chet! Thank God. Listen, I need you to pull the Alcatraz Park Rangers rules and procedure manual from the file drawer. I need to know if the cells at Alcatraz were ever retrofitted with release locks in case a tourist ever locked himself in. Now what kind of idiot would lock himself into a prison cell? Chet, either you pull the manual in the next ten seconds or I'm telling Rebecca you own the Twilight movies on blu-ray. All right, all right, hold on. You said there's an emergency office in the Ranger Station, right? Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, that's right. - Okay, good. Lead the way. What about the other two guys? No offense, but I can't be responsible for you. You're going to need backup. You got a spare gun? No offense, but you're a ranger. I can handle myself, honey. I didn't show up at Sally Port yesterday. "Sally Port"... that's an interesting choice of words. You want to tell me where you got that uniform? On your knees. Now. Take it easy, honey. On your knees, now. With me. Madsen, I'm out. Go! Come on! Come on! Come on! Open! Hauser, come on. Hold on a second, Pinky! Pinky! Take it easy. Take it easy, Pinky. Take it easy. We ain't getting behind that door. We need to stick to the plan. They're gonna pay. All of them... Starting with the man in the hole. Pinky? Wait! Hold on! You really need to let me take a look at that. I'm fine. The bullet went right through. - Hauser... - Have you ever been shot? - No, but I know... - What are we up against? Three men, at least one of them's a '63. Then we should assume they all are. All of them back together? What does that mean? You know what? Doesn't matter. They have Doc. No, don't. You're not hearing me. They have Doc. They could have killed him in the cell house. They didn't. That means there's a good chance that he's alive, but if you go in there with your guns blazing... They will kill him. What's the plan? We have them on video surveillance. Facial recognition will I.D. them. We need to know what they're doing here. Then we can work out how to go after them. Okay, Doc, I found it. The manual says the doors were modified with a safety release mechanism at the top of the sliding door. Chet, remind me to give you a raise. Because of you, my brother's dead! Wait! Stop, Pinky! Bolt cutters. Pick a hand. I said, "wait"! If he's with them, we can use him as bait. Get the little blondie to come to us, clear the way to the tunnels. That door your friends escaped behind... Does it connect with the dungeons? How many people are down there? A dozen. Maybe more. Your only chance is to run. If that were true, we'd already be dead. Stand up. There's no box for officer Donovan, but I have gone through the boxes of Edward "Pinky" Ames and his brother Herman. Now, the files indicate that they were famous for pulling high risk, high reward bank jobs, including coming close to robbing the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago. Hauser? trying to do here. You're trying to give me money again! When did I try to give you money? Over there with the bills! You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it. We had a nice last night together. We had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money. Now you start with the charity thing again! I'm trying to help you out. I wanna make sure that you're okay. I will be okay. You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing I'm gonna miss... ... isyou. And now the dog. -Call me when you get there, okay? -Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. I have your key. -Here you go. -Thanks. God, this is silly. I'll see you in a couple of hours. Bye, house. -She really left. -I know. -Thank you. -No problem, roomie. -Can I ask you a question? -Sure. What the hell is that dog doing here? I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. -And now you want that money back? -Exactly. What kind of idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game. I made it up. I'm sorry you lost your money. But I won it fair and square. At a fake game! If you wanna try to make some of it back... ... I'dbegladtoplay youforit . But I should warn you. I am very good at Cups. I assume the saucer card came up when you played last? Let's see if it comes up this time. Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent. Right! And when is that due? - First of the month. - And that's every month? No, just the months you actually want to live here. Okay, here is the phone bill. Oh my God! That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing. So why don't I just? why don't I just cover you for a while? No- no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity. ¡¦anymore. - It's not charity, Joe¡¦ - No! Forget it! Okay? I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on. Okay uh, here's the electric bill. - This is how much we pay for electric? ! - Uh, yeah. So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then? So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment? No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it. Well, how much do you think he needs? I figure that $1, 500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride. Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want. Well that would help the pride thing. Hey! Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow? - Okay. - Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight? Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel... We thought we'd go out to dinner. And celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe. And also, my birthday. It's not your birthday. What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday! - Hey! - Hey! Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night? Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing. Whoa- whoa- whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it. I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist. I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist! - Pheebs, I was wondering¡¦ - You're not dressed yet? We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes! Well and clearly not a minute sooner. Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed. Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight. My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place. Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you. Yeah, yeah, I know. Well, what you're wearing is fine for that. Rachel, I need to borrow? You're not packed! You're not packed even a little bit! Surprise! What? No, no don't get mad because look? this is what happened. So I - I started packing, then I realized. "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night. Ta- da! I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe? I have plans. - You're plans were with us. - That's right. All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out! Okay. Oh my God, thank you! Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves! Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with¡¦ Oh nope, I - I have plans with Joey. I thought you said you were going to do nothing. Yes, but for the last time. - Okay fine, now Ross¡¦ - Oh, but- but I can't do it. Why not? I've got Ben. Because, because I've got Ben. It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where- where is he? He's at a dinner party. Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment! Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as- as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am? All right, sorry. I gotta go make a fake Ben. Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates. Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese. Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours! Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money? What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued'97 season. - It would be easier if you just give me your money. - Yes it would. What do you say to $50? - Okay, you're on. - Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently. Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades. Oh God! You remember when we got these? No. I guess you weren't there. You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time¡¦ You don't remember? I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving. I'm gonna miss you so much. Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss. I don't think there's anything. Come on, there's gotta be something. Nope, she's perfect. I have one. Good! Great! You can go first. Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen? Aw, sometimes. Always, actually. Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better? Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages. You get your messages! Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch. So- so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? Great! It worked! No one's sad. Yes! I win again! Ha- ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo- ho- hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo- ho- ho! I gotta buy some food. Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1, 000. - You serious? - Oh yes! - Okay, get ready to owe me! - Okay. Okay, here we go. Ready? No! No! No! No? One can beat me. See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me! Ooh, your brother. Score! What's up? Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi. Oh, put him on! Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later. Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades? You know what else I'm not gonna miss?" I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!" "Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!" "I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!" Hey! I call her! "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!" "Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"' Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. Still broken? This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life. The foosball table and..... $500. Well, there are other ways of winning back your money. How about a little uh, a little Blackjack? Nah, not my game. Okay, uh, how about, how about? y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun. Well, what's it called? Cups. - I don't know how to play Cups. - I'll teach ya! - Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun. - All right. Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have? A two and a five. Ho- ho, you win! 50 dollars! - Really? - Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got? A four and a nine. You're kidding right? No. Why? Well that's a full cup! Damn! I am good at Cups! I'm not talking to her! Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her! Well, maybe you're right? She made fun of my phone pen! I know, I took it hard too. Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about? What are you doing? I'm unpacking! What? I'm not moving! Is that picture straight? It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left! Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave? - Because it's my apartment! - Well it's mine too! What else you got? How about, you're moving! Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you! Hey, how are you guys doing? Great! Monica's moving! I am not! Oh really? Then how come all your stuff is in this box? Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys¡¦ STOP! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep- deep down. No Phoebe I am mad! Well, deep- deep- deep down! Yeah, I'm just mad! Then keep running. You win. Well, what did you have? It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D - Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far? Uh, wow, 700. Not 700 exactly? Yeah. Double it! What? Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1, 500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get? No way! Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it,"What were you thinking?" Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse. But umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore. What? You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you! Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving. Whoa- whoa- whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I - I - I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. Oh really? Like what Monica? Y'know she has 147, 000 pairs of boots¡¦ Oh yeah, good start Mon. She lets you borrow them. Yeah and you stretch ¡®em out with your big old clown feet. Do you wanna live outside? Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like. What else? When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. Yeah, I do. I - I do, do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler... She was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! Oh, it's gonna be fine. Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun! But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler. Oh that's right. You're still set on that? Kinda. Oh my God! Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right? Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. Hey! What's wrong? Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break... I lost $1, 500 to him in Cups! Wh - How did you lose at Cups? The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D - Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'! Oh man! And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups. All right, let's play one more hand! One more! No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In- in fact, look, there's a? I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know.. Thank you for being such a great roommate. I can't take the big white dog! You love it! It's him, not it! No, but wait? what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say. $1, 500? Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You- you're trying to give me money again! When did I try to give you money? Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay. I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss¡¦is you. And now the dog. - Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay? - Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. - Oh! I have your key. Here you go. - Thanks. Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours. Bye house! Bye Mon. She really left. I know. Thank you. No problem roomie. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure! What the hell is that dog doing here? I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. - And now you want that money back. - Exactly. Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game! I made it up! I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square. At a fake game! Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups. Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last. No. Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time. - Okay. - Aah. Listen, I'm gonna be moving out, so you are gonna be in charge of paying the rent. - Right, and when is that due? - First of the month. And that's every month? No, just the months you actually want to live here. Ah. Okay, here's the phone bill. Oh, my God! That's our phone number. Look, I know I kind of sprung this whole me-moving-out-on-you thing. - So why don't I just cover you for a while? - No, no. No way. Joey Tribbiani does not take charity anymore. - It's not charity, Joe. - No, forget it. Okay? I mean, thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right? I can take care of myself. Now, what's next? Come on. Okay, uh, here's the electric bill. - This is how much we pay for electric? - Well, yeah. [GRUMBLES] CHANDLER: So we'll do the rest of the bills later, then? So is Joey gonna have to give up the apartment? I hope not. I tried to offer him money, but he wouldn't take it. How much do you think he needs? I figure $1500 would cover him for a few months, you know but I have to trick him into taking it so I don't hurt his pride. Yeah. Well, why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits whenever you want. Well, that would help the pride thing. - Hey. CHANDLER: Hey. Wow, you look great. Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow? - Okay. - Okay. What do you girls have planned for tonight? Instead of being sad that tonight's my last night with Rachel we thought we'd go out and celebrate: Rachel's moving in with Phoebe. - And also my birthday. Ha, ha. - It's not your birthday. What a mean thing to say. I would never tell you it was not your birthday. - Hey. - Hey. Hey, so you guys have anything planned for the big last night? Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Knicks' season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come and watch it. I don't know, Ross. Not if you talk about how you gave up basketball to become a paleontologist. I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist. - Pheebs, I was wondering... - You're not dressed yet? We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes! Well, and clearly, not a minute sooner. Rachel, you are packed, though, right? I mean, please tell me you're packed. Of course I'm packed. Monica, relax. I wanted to ask Phoebe for her opinion on what I should wear. My God, I cannot get a minute of peace. Oh, my God. Monica's just gonna kill you. I know. What you're wearing is fine for that. You're not packed! You're not packed even a little bit. Surprise. Don't get mad, because, look, this is what happened. So I started packing, and then I realized, "What am I doing?" I am lousy at packing, right? But you love packing. So as a gift to you on our last night... Ta-da. I'll be coordinator. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I didn't get you anything. Oh. Look, everybody has to help. Phoebe, you can help, can't you? I have plans. - You have plans with us. - That's right. All right. Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. - Tell the guys they have to help out. - Okay. MONICA: Okay. - My God, thank you. Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack. She's got jobs for everyone. Now, it's too late for me, but save yourselves. MONICA: Okay. The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help. Chandler... No, I have plans with Joey. - I thought you said you were doing nothing. - Yes, but for the last time. Okay, fine. Now, Ross... - Oh, but I can't do it. - Why not? - Don't you have Ben? - Because I have Ben. It's almost 8:00, it's almost past his bedtime. Where is he? He's at a dinner party. Is he really coming? Because I can see into your apartment. Of course he is. Uh, what? You think I'd just use my son as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am? All right. Sorry. I gotta go make a fake Ben. Here it is. Our last pizzas together as roommates. I wish I'd known you were gonna do that. I ordered Chinese. Oh. Oh, that's okay. Hey, actually, in a way it's kind of nice. You know? Our last dinner together. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors you, the food of yours. Huh? Say, Joe, I had a strange idea for what to do on our last night. What do you say we play a little, uh, foosball for money? Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury-plagued '97 season. It'd be easier if you'd just give me your money. Yes, it would. Ahem. What do you say to $50? - Okay, you're on. - Okay, let's play. The big game. Italy versus China, apparently. Oh, look, it's the Rollerblades. Oh, God. You remember when we got these? No. Oh, I guess you weren't there. You guys, we said we were gonna have fun. Come on. Hey, ha, ha, remember the time? [LAUGHING] You don't remember? Sorry, Pheebs. I guess I'm just really sad that I'm leaving. I'm gonna miss you so much. Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though, you know? Instead of thinking about how much you're gonna miss about each other you should, like, think about some of the things you're not gonna miss. I don't think there's anything. Come on, there's gotta be something. Nope. She's perfect. I have one. Good. Great. Okay, you can go first. Uh, well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. Ha, ha. [BOTH LAUGHING] That's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? You know, does Rachel move the phone pen? - Aw, sometimes. - Ha, ha. Always, actually. Good. There you go. Doesn't everyone feel better? [CHUCKLES] It's not just the phone pen. It's just that I never get my messages. You get your messages. Well, I don't think it counts if you have to read them off your hand after you've fallen asleep on the couch. So you missed a message from who? Chandler? Or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? Great, it worked. No one's sad. Heh. - Yes. - Ah. I win again. Ha, ha, that's, like, 500 bucks you owe me. Woo-hoo! Man. Five hundred dollars. That is a lot of electricity, huh? Woo-hoo! Ooh, I gotta buy some food. Okay, okay. Give me a chance to win my money back. Sudden death one goal, $1000. - You serious? - Oh, yes. Okay. - Get ready to owe me. - Okay. Okay, here we go. Ready? - No, no, no! - No, no, no! No one can beat me. See, now that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Oh, hi, Ross. See, other people call me. Ooh, your brother. Score. - What's up? ROSS [OVER PHONE]: I'm here with Ben. Thought we'd say hi. - Put him on. - Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. Uh, he's smiling, though. Okay, talk to you later. I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, oh, remember the Rollerblades? Oh. You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilets 17 times a day, even if people are on it." "Hi, I'm Rachel. Is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it." "I'm Monica. I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever." Hey, I call her. "Oh, my God. I love Ross. I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross." "Oh, my God. I can't find a boyfriend. So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there." Yeah, we should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations. Still broken? It sucks, man. Your last night here, and I lose the two most important things: The foosball table and $500. Well, you know, there are other ways you can win back your money. - How about blackjack? - Ah, not my game. Okay, uh, you know what? We can play a new game. - A new game. It's fun. - What's it called? Cups. - I don't know how to play Cups. - I'll teach you. It's really easy and fun. - All right. - Okay, here you go. I have two queens. What do you have? - A two and a five. - Whoa, you win. Fifty dollars. - Really? - Oh, yeah. Okay, let's play again. Ready? Ooh! - What have you got? - A four and a nine. You're kidding, right? - No. Why? - Well, that's a full cup. Damn, I am good at Cups. I'm not talking to her. One of you has to take the first step and it should be you because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her. Maybe you're right. But she made fun of my phone pen. I know. I took it hard too. Listen, Rachel, I feel bad about what happened... - What are you doing? - I'm unpacking. - What? - I'm not moving. Is that picture straight? It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left. Hey, you know what? You're the one who wants this big change and move in with Chandler. You should go. Why do I have to leave? - Because It's my apartment! - Well, it's mine too. What else you got? How about: You're moving! RACHEL: No, no, no. MONICA: Yes, yes, yes. Okay, Monica... This is ridiculous. We should be packing you. PHOEBE: Hey, how you guys doing? RACHEL: Great. Monica's moving. I am not! Oh, really? Well, how come all your stuff is in this box? Okay, you guys, you guys, I think I know what's going on here. Okay? You guys? Stop! I know that you're acting mad because you think that will make it easier to leave. But deep down, you're still really sad. Deep, deep down. - No, Phoebe, I am mad! - Well, deep, deep, deep down. Yeah, I'm just mad. Then keep running. You win. - What did you have? - Doesn't matter. Nothing beats a three and a six. That, my friend, is "D Cup." Okay, now, how much have you won so far? - Wow. Seven hundred. - Not 700 exactly? - Yeah. - Heh. Double it. - What? - Yeah, see, in Cups, once you get $700 you have to double it. - Really? - Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Okay, so now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get, uh, one card. Now, that one card could be worth $100, which brings your total to 1500. - Ooh. - No, no, no. Don't get too excited, because that's not gonna happen unless you get the... No way. Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it "What were you thinking?" Funny, I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Okay, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but I don't wanna live with Rachel anymore. BOTH: What? - You're just so mean to each other. And I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel. I still like you. Well, Phoebe, that's fine because I'm not moving. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Phoebe, you gotta take her. You know, I know I said some bad stuff but Rachel does have some qualities that make her a good roommate. Oh, really? Like what, Monica? You know how she has 147,000 pair of boots? Oh, yeah, good start, Mon. - She lets you borrow them. - Yeah. And you stretch them out with your big old clown feet. Do you wanna live outside? Because it's getting cold. She gets tons of catalogs and, um, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks I'd like. - What else? - Uh... When I take a shower she leaves me little notes on the mirror. Yeah, I do. I do do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch after reading she covers me over with a blanket. Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her I was gonna be moving in with Chandler she was really supportive. [SOBBING] You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! It's gonna be fine. Okay, Rachel. Now I can't wait to live with you. You know what we should do? Bring Monica, and then we can all live there together. We'll have so much fun! But, honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler. Oh, that's right. You're still set on that? Kind of. Oh, my God. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Hey, Mon. How's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right... Oh, my God. Get your head out of your shirt there, son. What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. Hey. - What's wrong? - Ross and I were helping the girls pack took a little break. I lost $1500 to him in Cups. Wha...? How did you lose at Cups? The same way you lost. I started out with the king and the queen. Bam. Ross gets a two and a three. Then I get a jack and a king. Boom. Ross gets a four and five. Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup the sitting-down bonus. Meanwhile, I didn't even get a half cup. Nothing. Oh, man. He never played before either. You know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups. Let's just play one more hand. One more hand. No, no more. I cannot lose another dime. I'm serious this time. In fact, look. There's... I wanna give you something, okay? And let me give it to you now before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big, white dog as a... Kind of a thank-you for being such a great roommate. I can't take the big, white dog. You love it. It's "him." Not "it." Well, what if I bought it from you, you know? And then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price. Say $1500? Wait a second. I see what you're trying to do here. You're trying to give me money again. When did I try to give you money? Before, over there with the bills. You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it. Okay, then we had a nice last night together.

The only thing I'm gonna miss is you. And now the dog. MONICA: Hey. - Call me when you get there, okay? - Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. Oh, I have your key. - Here you go. - Thanks. Oh, God, this is silly. I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours. Bye, house. [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Bye-bye. - Bye. Hey. - She really left. - I know. - Thank you. - No problem, roomie. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. What the hell is that dog doing here? I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. - And now you want that money back? - Exactly. Chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game. I made it up.

Well, deep-deep-deep down! Yeah, I'm just mad! Then keep running. You win. Well, what did you have? It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far? Uh, wow, 700. Not 700 exactly? Yeah. Double it! What? Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get? No way! Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?" Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse. But umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore. What? ! You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you! Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving. Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. Oh really? Like what Monica? Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots... Oh yeah, good start Mon. She lets you borrow them. Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet. Do you wanna live outside? ! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like. What else? When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler... She was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! Oh, it's gonna be fine. Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun! But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler. Oh that's right. You're still set on that? Kinda. Oh my God! Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right? Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. Hey! What's wrong? Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break... I lost $1,500 to him in Cups! Wh-How did you lose at Cups? ! The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'! Oh man! And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups. All right, let's play one more hand! One more! No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a? I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know.. Thank you for being such a great roommate. I can't take the big white dog! You love it! It's him, not it! No, but wait? what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say. $1,500? Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again! When did I try to give you money? Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay. I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss is you. And now the dog. - Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay? - Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. - Oh! I have your key. Here you go. - Thanks. Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours. Bye house! Bye Mon. She really left. I know. Thank you. No problem roomie. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure! What the hell is that dog doing here? ! I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. - And now you want that money back. - Exactly. Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game! I made it up! I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square. At a fake game! Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups. Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last. No. Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time. Previously on ER... What time are you off? Now. You should all offer Dr. Corday your congratulations since most of you... will be working with her in her new position as associate chief of surgery. What's all this about, Robert? No "Thank you I'm honored"? No "I hope I don't dissapoint"? You still want to marry me? - Yes. - Ok. So, she's looking at surgery? Has to have a mastectomy, I'm affraid. What about Reece, eh? You ever think of that? I mean you want to take him away from his father? You may not even be his father. What? 6x03 "GREENE WITH ENVY" Hi. I'm here to see Dr. Weaver. - She went that way handing out badges. - Excuse me? "Creativity, accountability, respect, excellence." That's a lot to live up to. - He's looking for Dr. Weaver. - This way. - Help me. I'm dying here... - You'll be all right. Let's go. Sit here. - Lucy this guy has a little cut on his arm. - A cut? ! The bitch stabbed me! What'd she stab you with, sir? - Carving knife. Like I'm a damn steak or something! There goes the ulnar! You're killing me! Just breathe. I'm sorry. Sit down, please. Hold still. Don't be such a baby. We can't help you unless you stop. Look me in the eye. Hold still. - Are you a doctor? - Keep the pressure on. We'll use this to make a tourniquet. Get his arm out. Put your arm out. Come on around this side. - Pump it up to 180. - Keep breathing. Relax. - We got 180. - All right, take your hand off. Creativity. That's what's on your badge. Who are you? Sorry I'm late. You all right? Get me some curved Kellys and Vicryl, I'll be even better. Good to see you. Lucy, this is Dr. Gabriel Lawrence, our new Attending. How do you do? - Mark. - I know, I'm late. Meet Gabe Lawrence. This is Dr. Mark Greene. Dr. Lawrence, it's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Don't hold it against me. - Were you in an accident? - No, I started my shift a little early. - I'm sorry? - Gabe's from New Western... - ... as our new Attending. - As our new Attending. - We're incredibly lucky to have him. - Absolutely. We're gonna take the grand tour. Would you like to come with us? I've done the tour. I'm gonna get this. - What do you got, Doris? - A 28-year-old fell off his bike. I didn't fall. A cab cut me off. Passed out for two minutes. Small contusions to his Forehead. Vitals are stable. - Reece might not be yours? - That's what she said. - You think she lying? - I don't know. I wasn't with her 24 hours a day. Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man. - She's gonna use this against me, isn't she? - She can't. If Carla had any doubts she should've raised them at the petition... to determine parentage three months ago. She didn't, so it's moot. It's not a problem. You've put yourself through a hell of a lot for this. Maybe we should make sure he's yours? - Do a DNA test. - No. Peter, you hired me to protect your interests. If you want a way out, she gave you one. We'll have to intubate. Okay, on my count. One, two, three. Good. - What do we got? -16-year-old male. Single GSW to the left chest. I'm gonna put him in a chest tube. Can you intubate? I think I can manage. 15 of Etomidate, 100 of sux, number-eight ET tube. - Help. - You're gonna be okay. What's his name? Joshua Fox. That's his only I.D. he had. They'll put a tube down your throat to help you breathe. - Can you call his family? - Off a video card? It's all we've got. Thora-Seal's ready. Hook me up. What's this about a rescheduled surgery this afternoon? Got a cancellation, so I moved up a mastectomy. Oh, well, you can hold it back down. I've got an elective hernia. I'm sorry. I'm not going to torture a woman for another two weeks... just so some man can have his groin patched. Once again, male surgeons decide- Ok, I surrender. Hormones talking. You can have your surgery. I'm in. Bag him. Well, It doesn't seem to be much blood in here at all. I'll sew the tube in. An O silk. Good breath. Call ICU. - See if we can get him a bed? - Sure. Be right back. So, Dr. Cordey, the mastectomy coming in today, is it Elaine Nichols? - I thought that wasn't until- - I moved it forward. Sure that's the right thing to do? Isn't it kind of fast? - Why are you so interested? - She's a friend of the family. Really? Then I shouldn't be discussing it with you, should I? Make sure you get a chest film. Lucy, you finished assisting Dr. Carter. Good. I have something for you. The Chicago Gazette is sending over a reporter today. Mostly to do a puff piece on me. But they also want to take a look at the ER. Why are you telling me? Well, because you're going to show them around let him see what heroes we all are. How we save kiddies' lives. Etcetera. Blow my trumpet. - You do that better yourself. - Look at you. Look at me. - Who'd you rather spend and hour with? - You have a point. - Next time wear a helmet. - Come on, doc, Give me a break. How about a fractured skull? Want to be fed through a tube? Be my guest. Okay, I'll wear the helmet. Can I go now? Not yet. We need a head CT. What's that? My Core Values badge. Creativity, Accountability, Respect, Excellence. All that and beautiful too. You must be some kind of nurse. I am. - Why doesn't Dr. Grumpy have one? - Guess I'm out of the loop. It looks like you've got a broken arm, Loren. We're gonna need some x-rays. Any other sign of trauma? Contusion to the right shoulder, ecchymosis of the face and right hip... And slight wrist tenderness to the wrist. - How far did you fall, Loren? - I'm not sure. Can you tell me how you fell? Did you fall like this, or did you fall more on your hand? Yes. - What, on your hand? - I don't remember. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Don't worry. That's what we have x-rays for. So I'll get an AP, and a lateral of the forearm, as well as wrist and elbow films. Sure, we don't want to miss anything. It's busy. I know, Patient through-time... is longer than at New Western. But our census is bigger. OH, busy is good. Busy keeps you young. I'll just take a look at that fellow in Three. Look at that. How cute is that. Thanks, guys. - What's in here, it's so heavy? - Something to spice up your wedding night. Conni! You shouldn't have. Spice up mi wedding night? Sure! Nice hot gumbo to keep up his strength. Jenny, It's this your last shift for a while? Yep, catching a plane at 6:00 to New Orleans. Then in the morning, Reggie will make me an honest woman... and I'm going to show him the town. Show him a wild time in New Orleans, honey! I'm sure he'll be very happy. Didn't I give you a Core Values badge? - A toddler chewed it. - There you go. beautiful, solar-lit. Now, isn't this beautiful? Look at this open space. And what I love about this house for you, Judge Reid are the floor-to-ceiling built-ins in the study for all of your law books. And for you, Mrs. Reid, the east-facing front door. So feng shui. Feng what? It's Chinese, baby. It means harmony. I assume the sellers are looking for full price. Well, we can ask, but I doubt they will be willing to come down. But there aren't many homes in this neighborhood with a garage big enough for your vintage-car collection. How did you know about my Corvettes? Oh, I make it my business to know the unique needs of all of my clients. I think I'd like to see how my chi flows... -...through the master bedroom. -Sure. I'll leave this with the judge. Wait until you see the bedroom balcony. The view is spectacular. Funk shwa. Don't know why Darnell needs to hate like that. Come on, man. I kind of thought we'd been over this, D. Yeah, it was 1 5 years ago. He needs to get over it. -Got three more. -You gotta look at it like this. -He feel he got dealt a bad hand. -Nobody forced him to sling that crack. Well, he just needs to realize that life isn't always fair, man. Believe me, I know. Come on, now, just what part of your magnificent life are you whining about now? What are you talking about, man? I'm getting screwed by the divorce lawyers. Well, B, you act like you don't know why. You getting screwed because you a hound. -l'm not a hound. -You get more tail than a public toilet. True, but with Fiona, I was always faithful. I mean, I may have browsed, but I never bought. -You never bought? -l never bought. -Never bought? -Never. What about the Thai massages you like to get? All right, so what? I bought once or twice. See, that's your problem, man. Me, personally, I don't browse, I don't buy. I keep my eyes straight ahead. I'm focused. I don't see nothing else. I even turned in my player card. Yeah, man, I feel you. Clarice has radar. She can even see my eyes moving behind my sunglasses. You wanna know what I do, though? When I wake up, I just tell Vanessa sorry. I don't care if I did anything. I tell her sorry. I tell her sorry about 1 0 times a day. Why? Because if I do something, I already apologized. She has nothing to say. Makes her happy. And a happy wife equals what? A happy husband. That isn't living. That's just breathing. Hey, I tell you what. I'm not the one losing my big screen. And why is the chair so low? Put it so I can use the machine, Brock. -Julie, Julie. That's my girl. -Who's that? -My girl, Julie. -Dave. And the guy at the front desk says she's single. So am I. Well, almost. Tell me why you walked over here. What are you even looking at? This is not our ballpark. We're focusing, Brock. Eyes on the prize. I got my eyes on the prize. Hey, looking good. Keep going. Keep pushing, Bryson. Don't quit. Keep pushing, buddy. Last half lap. Push to the end, Bryson. Finish strong, buddy. Kick it. Good. Good job, buddy. Great heat, baby. How did that feel, Bryson? Good, I guess. Feel that good? New record. Remember to count your strokes so you know when you're near the wall. You see that scar? No accidents. -Sorry, coach, I forgot that time. -All right. Now, with the regional finals coming up, what would you say if I included your freestyle in the 400 medley? It's the 1 4-year-olds, but I want you to start steering toward the Junior Olympics for next year. I'll take that as a yes. -We're gonna get some pizza. -l'm so excited. -Mom, stop, it's embarrassing. -Why? I'm excited. You just cleaned the clocks of a bunch of high school freshmen. Baby, you awake? I am now. Are you drunk? No, I'm not drunk. -Just had a beer with the fellas. -That's nice. -You know what I was thinking? -What? I was thinking that we need to get back to the loving part of our marriage. I know what this is about. Trying to keep up with Tree and Vanessa. -No, I ain't trying to keep up-- -Yes, you are, yes, you are. I just look at you, and I just think that we could have some beautiful babies. David, how many times do we have to have this discussion? I'm not ready for babies. Would you move over? It's hot in here. I'm not ready for babies. I have a career, I have dreams, I have places I wanna go. -l do too. -A baby's just gonna get in the way. Besides, you're building a business, okay? You can't come home all hours of the night after drinking with your boys, and then expect to have sex like rabbits all night long. Oh, by the way, I need you home by 5:00 tomorrow for my awards ceremony. Yeah. Whatever. Like that rag on your head. That's why you're not getting any. There we go, get it. Keep your butt down. Keep your butt down. See the ball into the glove. You'll get it, Marcus. All right, here we go. Get in there. -There you go. -Good play, that's what I like to see. -That's what I like to see. -Yeah, boy, yeah, boy. Who's your daddy now, sucker? Please, cracker. You looking like your white mama making that play. -What? -Hey, not today. Hey. Hey. -Just let go. -Go, fight, fight, fight. Get- - Hey, hey. -What--? -Come on, man. -Get your hands-- -Break it up. -Boy, you better get up. -Bring it in. -Get up. -Bring it in. Des, what's wrong with you, huh? How many times do I have to tell you? Nobody is gonna disrespect anybody on this team. You got that? Now, both of you look at me. What race am I? Black. Wrong. You know what Brother King said? He said I'm human first, then I'm black. There's only one race of people, and that's the human race. But there's two kinds of people, the good ones and bad ones. Now, Darius, look at Coach Brock. What race is he? White. We're gonna have to work on that. Hit the bases. Let's go. What are you saying, man? Martin Luther King never said those words. No, that was Tyrone King. You know, he owns that barber shop down there on Florence. You're lying. I know Tyrone. He stutter. He don't even talk like that. Look, look, we got company, dude. Come on. You gotta get up out of here with that King Cobra. I ain't got to get up out of nowhere, man. I can come see my boy anywhere I want to. Not drunk on your ass, you can't. It's a bad influence on the boys and against league rules. Get out of here, man, come on. Oh, what, you gonna go get the police on me? Because of the rules, you gonna go get the police on me? All right, I ain't gonna cause no trouble. Darius, let's go. Coach said we gotta go. I ain't finished playing yet. What? Man, get your ass over here right now. I said it's time to go. -God. -l'll drag your ass out of here. Get over here now. Who you talking to like that? Better not ever talk to me like that, boy. No wonder Darius has an attitude. With him as his father. Well, see, he's his daddy. He's a long way from being his father, man. Let's go. Here we go. Why you gotta make me quit the team? You better watch how you talk to me, boy, before I put my foot in your ass. But I wanna play ball like you did. Oh, now you're saying you wanna be like me? You really wanna be like me, then buck up. Do you see me out there? I ain't chasing after no empty dreams in no field wasting my damn time. I'm in the real world. You wanna come to the real world? Because the real world eats your ass and spits your ass out. Wake up. Stop dreaming. Did you really forget about my awards ceremony? I know, I just got carried away with the boys, baby, all right? -Give me five minutes. Five minutes. -You are so insensitive and selfish. Everything is about you and those damn boys. Do you have any idea how important this night is for me? How hard I've worked for us? Or what an honor it is to be Salesperson of the Year? Look, I know it's a big night for you, okay? I'm sorry. I got a little caught up on the field, I apologize. Why do you waste your time with those boys? Clarice, don't start. Don't start. You know how important it is for me to be coaching kids. They're not gonna do nothing but end up in prison like their ghetto-pass-carrying daddies. I saw your lips moving, but it was your mother's nagging-ass voice-- You leave Mama out of this. You leave Mama out of this. All I know is if you spent half of the time at home you do with those boys, we wouldn't be having-- -Look, I said I was sorry. -Oh, whatever-- Clarice. Clarice, baby, you okay? -All right, what do you got for me? -BP is 85l55. -Resp. is 1 2 and falling. -Distal pulse is dropping. -We got a line in. -There's obvious abdominal edema. -Get the O.R. ready. -l'll call. -Come on, people, let's go. -Move. We will take care of her. -Someone needs to take care of that. -She needs me. -lt's hospital policy. -All right, all right. -You're hurt, we'll take care of you. -l got it. Why don't you spend a few moments with her? She's still coming out of anesthesia. She's under a lot of pain medication. You got one tough cookie here. She told me I wasn't allowed to remove any of her body parts without her permission. That's my Reesie. Tough as nails. Can I speak to you outside for a minute? Mr. Johnson, this is a very severe injury. If she doesn't wanna park in the handicapped spot the rest of her life, she's gonna need months of physical therapy. You need to make her understand that. Okay. -Are you gonna be all right? -Yeah, thank you. You're welcome. How is she doing? Her leg was broke pretty bad. is she gonna be all right? Yeah. It could've been a lot worse, though. Yeah, it makes you count your blessings. You gonna be able to take over the team for a while? -Yeah, don't worry about it. -Yeah, yeah. We do most of the work anyway, right? Here, look, I got Clarice some flowers. She'll like these. Yeah, I got you a bear. You got him a bear? Yes, I got him a bear. -You bought that for him? -Brock, yes, I brought him- - Yes. It's my money. Clarice Johnson. I'm looking for Clarice Johnson. -She's in Recovery, right there. -Thank you. Dave, Dave. Okay, okay, what--? Just tell me what happened. She's okay, all right? -Now, she had to have surgery-- -Surgery. -Why didn't you call me sooner? -Everything was happening so fast. I wasn't thinking straight. It looks like you had time to call everybody else. Where is she? -We're gonna go. -We're gonna go. -Nice to see you. -What happened? -Okay, where is she? -Okay, it was an accident, all right? Somebody ran a red light and hit us. It just came from nowhere. You know what? I don't wanna hear that. She called me when she was at home waiting for you. Now, if you hadn't been late coaching those kids you would've paid more attention. You wouldn't have been in a hurry. This is your fault, Dave. This is your fault. Now, where is she? Two-fifteen. Once, I heard a radio host ask the question: "Why do bad things happen to good people?" During Clarice's weeks in the hospital we asked that question a lot. I tried to be there for her in every way a husband should. But it just seemed like it was never enough. And when we came home the reality that everything had changed began to sink in. -We gonna get you through this. -We? We aren't the ones with their leg twisted up like a damn pretzel. Got everything in the house already taken care of for you. We got about a week's worth of meals in the freezer. When we get inside.... -You all right? -Yeah. When we get inside, I'm gonna warm you up a hot little plate. -Oh, boy. -And get some food. I got you. -l've moved in. -Mama. Hey, baby. Well, don't just stand there. Bring her on in. Look, I appreciate your concern and all that, but I got this, okay? I'm capable of taking care of my wife, and I got-- l got you, baby, okay? Dave, I figured I was gonna have to break this down to you. Now, if things was jiggy as all that I wouldn't have to be here now, would I? -Okay. -Like I said, bring her on in here. -Come on. -l'm so glad you're here, Mama. I'm here, baby. -Dave. -See that? -That's what I'm talking about. -l got it. -Be careful with her. -l got it. So rough. -She already had one accident. -Now you gonna break my other foot. I know, that's what I'm talking about. The only way you're gonna get Mama out of the house is to get Clarice back on her feet. The doctor told me she wants me to get Clarice into physical therapy. Oh, you know--? Remember that girl I had my eye on? -Which girl? -No, the girl- lt's the girl over at the pool, Julie. -Oh, okay, I do. Word around the club is she's one of the top therapists. You should give her a call. See if she makes house calls. -There you go. -And then, you know, let me know. You know what D's problem is? He hasn't learned from the lessons I've learned from. I try to tell you things, but you do not listen, man. The other night, Vanessa's taking a bubble bath. She's in the tub, looking good. Normally, that's my green light to go in there and do what I'm supposed to do. So I go in there, to get a little cuddly with her, and she shoved me off. Like, pushed me. She's bigger than me, you know that. So when she pushed me, I fell back. And she was like, you know, "Get away, you stinky man." Now, what I need to know-- Not wanna know. What I need to know, am I a stinky man? Seriously, like, do I smell? Am I the friend that stink and y'all don't tell me, because we close? -Do I have stinky breath? -l don't know. -Do I have stinky breath? -l don't know. -Tell me. Smell my breath. -l'm not gonna. -Smell my breath. -l'm not gonna smell-- You're gonna smell my breath. -l figured that. -l'm telling you, man. Even after everything Fiona and I have been through, I still miss her. -Are you serious? -lt's something about the way she.... She crosses those legs and she just bounces those high heels up and down. My thing is when I just get home Reesie's just getting out the shower. She puts on one of my little old tank tops. Starts painting her toenails. You know what I like? I like it.... l like it when Vanessa has me rub this skin cream on her back. She's got bad eczema. Big bumps on her back. And it needs to be moisturized. And I do it. I do it. It's a little rocky moisturizing roll on her back, but I don't mind. Because that's what she has me do, you know. -Years I've been doing that. -Tree. -Are you crying? -What? -Are you crying? No, look at me. -Come on, I'm enjoying myself, right? -You are crying. -l'm not crying, man. It's not even tears, man. I feel like these women got us in a beam, so we-- They got us in one of them Star Wars contractor-beam things. It's pulling us in. You know what I'm talking about? It's like we couldn't escape that beam if we wanted to, you know. It's like you want to, but you love it. You love it so much that you can't. You can't escape it. It's an interesting way of putting it, Star Wars. -That's what you said, Star Wars? -Star Wars, man, it's a beam. It's a beam, it's like a light. They shine it at you. It mess with your body, your nerves and stuff, and you can't move. You just gotta allow yourself to get pulled in. And I'm getting pulled in. You need to get pulled in and you need to get pulled in. Accept it, man. Accept your life. -l accept mine. -No, no, no. -You're right, I probably had enough. -Yeah. I probably had too many. -Oh, no, honey, we're not buying-- -l got this, I got this. I hope I have the right address. I'm Julie Sawyer. You called for an in-home physical therapist? -Yeah, that's right. -Okay. -Dave Johnson, come on in. -Nice to meet you. Reesie, this is the physical therapist I was telling you about. Please have a seat. This is Miss Sawyer. And I'm Mrs. Clark, her mother. How do you do? Mrs. Johnson? Look, Mrs. Johnson, I know after all you've been through the last thing you want is a stranger in your life, so.... How about we get to know each other--? I'm not looking for anyone to psychoanalyze me either. Okay, well, that's good, because that's not why I'm here. But, you know, to be honest talking about how you're feeling emotionally can help me design a better plan to get you on-- How I feel. Lord Jesus, where did y'all find her? How I feel? You wanna know how I feel? I feel like Humpty Dumpty, that's how I feel. Clarice, you need to calm down. Let this woman do her job. Now, you do know what you're doing, right? Yes, ma'am. Mrs. Johnson, I understand. So why don't I just come back tomorrow, and we'll begin then? Bingo, that's a great place to start. How about you come back never? What about that? -That works for me. -Okay, no, we're gonna do this today. And you're gonna calm down. You stop acting like this. Come on now. Just leave me alone, okay? Just leave me alone. Just.... The bishop used to tell a story about Adam and Eve. When God made Adam, he instructed him to do three things: -Work, cultivate, protect. -Two, three, down. -That's great. -Oh, my God, that's incredible, okay. What we're gonna do today is have a little fun. Down through history, men have been measured by how hard they've worked and cultivated by how well they've protected their wives and children. Down, three, two, one. Up again. Up, one, two, three, hold. In the old days women saw their men as conquerors, providers, heroes. But somewhere along the line, that changed. Push, push. Women started becoming their own heroes. Okay, how's this there? Maybe it was because their men forgot how to be heroic. Or because women didn't wanna be protected anymore. Or maybe women had to be their own heroes because of the pain they had to endure in life. Look, he's handsome. -Bryson. -Bryson. He's so handsome. But whatever the cause the world took away a man's reasons for being a man. They told him he wasn't important anymore. And when that happened it turned the whole world upside-down. -l don't know how to thank you. -You don't need to. You really don't. You know what you can do? You could write a letter to my boss at the clinic saying you've never met a skilled or more professional therapist. I wanna thank you too, Julie. Look at her. She's doing extremely well. Yes, you are truly gifted at what you do. Thank you. -Okay, I'll see you Monday? -Yeah. -Okay, great. -Get home safely, okay? -l will. -Take care. -Enjoy your evening, okay? -l will. -Hey, baby. -Hey, what's up? Not much. No, no, no, don't worry. It does it all the time. It's probably just the battery. I'll be fine. -lt sounds more than just the battery. -No, no, please go on inside, go on. Nonsense, you can't be late for your son. -Dave will run you home. -Good. -No, it's my hoop night. -Hoops night? I ain't gonna miss my night. I can call her a tow truck. Miss your hoops, are you insane? You're missing the point here. This woman saved your wife's life. -He can miss his hoops. -Okay, I don't wanna put anyone out. -lt'll make me feel worse, please. -Little girl, little girl. Get your ass in this car. Let me ask a question. I have a friend who has actually been wanting to ask you out on a date. -Me? -Yeah, you. But he's in a complicated situation. Oh, God, no, don't tell me. He's recently broken up or getting divorced or lives with his mother? Getting divorced. No, I appreciate that, but I think I'll pass. Single mothers don't have a lot of options but I don't really need to be his rebound relationship. If it's all the same. So how long has he been swimming? Oh, as soon as I could get him in the water. He loves it. -Hey, Bry. -Hi, Mom. This is Dave. His wife's my patient. -Remember, the ones in the accident? -Right. -How do you do, sir? -How's it going? My car broke down again, but Dave offered to give us a ride. Cool. So you like baseball, Bryson? Well, I've always wanted to try it. But Mom throws like a girl. Watch it. Well, I coach a team over at East Side Field and if you want, you could stop by some time and I could show you a few pointers. -Really? -Yeah. That would be totally sick. Oh, ours is.... The street up there. The minute I get in the house, I'll call for a tow for that car. You don't have to do that. I know a mechanic that owes me a favor so I'll have him take a look at it. Clarice and I owe you. -Are you sure? -Yeah, no problem. Thank you. All right. -All right. -Lord, yes. Oh, yeah. -All right. -Praise the Lord. -Hallelujah. -Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus called out to the multitudes. -He said, "Come to me. -Come. -All who are weary, come to me. -Come to me. -And I will give you rest." -Yes, he will. He said, "l will give you rest if you come to me." Amen. So today, I want you to stand up and come down to the altar. Come down. I always felt church is like a hospital. It's where sick people go to get well. Anybody out there that needs praying for today. Or maybe you just need just a little encouragement. Jesus said.... Whenever I went to church, I felt hope. Come on, come to me. -Yes. -Amen. Glory, hallelujah. Girl, when I saw you, hey, I almost went in. I said my D was looking like Miss America... -...up in here. -Stop it. I hope this don't mean you're about to come back to work and I gotta start fighting you for clients. -Well.... -Oh, you know, I meant to tell you. Mr. Hastings forced me to take some of your clients while you were gone. Girl, don't worry about that. -l would do the same thing to you. -Okay. But you better bring your boxing gloves to work. Girl, I can't fight. I just got my nails done. You crazy, come here, girl. It was really good to see you folks in church today. Well, with what we've been through, it's good to be seen. The Lord's been good, bishop. Clarice has got her trainer, has her walking again and Dave's been a real trouper. No, no, you have. We are here for you, 2 4l7. Even if you just wanna come in and talk. -Come here. -lt is so good to see you. -You too, love you. -l love you too, girl. -Okay. -See you tomorrow. You better bring your gloves. I'm glad it ain't a street fight because you know I don't wanna get my face scratched up. Hey, baby, how you doing? -Okay, take care of my girl. -Todd, let's go. Come on, now, you know I'm hungry. I got to get to brunch. You're walking all slow. It's sickening, man. He really disgusts me, dude. -Hi, Julie. -Yes? I'm Brock Houseman. I'm a friend of Dave Johnson's. Yeah, I.... Has he mentioned me at all? Yeah- - No, well.... Bet you $ 1 0, he's gonna take all the credit for fixing the car. You fixed my car? I don't know what to say. -No, don't. -Thank you. No, you don't understand. Don't say anything. lt's my pleasure. Why are we even here? Tell me why we're here. We're part of the problem, man. -No, we're accomplices. -No, we're not, you are. -All right. -You drove, I'm not a part of this. -Look at him. -Look, look, look. What? Why are you so happy? -What? -Nothing, nothing at all, Satan. Satan? Hey, hey, l-- l can't help it. I am not ashamed. -Get in the back. -l have no problem getting in the back. Better not tell Vanessa I was here. So I think you can see how a retail space in this neighborhood can be a home run. Well, I like what I see, Clarice. -lt's actually quite impressive, really. -Yeah, it has lots of potential. Excuse me, who will be taking the check? -We will. Sure? -No, no, no, I got it. -Please, I insist. -No, l- l insist. -No, I got it. -Are you sure? -Yeah, I'm positive. Go ahead, Dave. -Thank you very much. -You're so welcome. It's nice to see you back up on your feet now. It is so good to be back. I can only imagine. Dave, tell me, I'm interested in getting your perspective. What's it like to have a wife who is as progressive as Clarice? Well, you know, anything Clarice puts her mind to is gonna be successful, so you guys are in good hands. Oh, impressive. As a general contractor, I thought you might be able to weigh in and share your perspectives from a professional level on the architectural flow chart that she's presented to us today. Well, see, with this particular project, my approach.... l mean, I would approach it in a way that.... Actually, the projects I work on are a little bit smaller. -About 3000 to 5000 square feet. -Dave, Dave, don't be so-- He's just being modest. David owns a very lucrative construction company. -Really? -Yes, sweetheart. I was just letting them know that the projects I normally-- You don't have to let everybody know everything. lt's okay. -We're looking to get into-- -l was just telling the man-- -Don't tell the man everything. -Maybe we could work together. You might be able to be the general contractor, do the finish-out work. -Yeah. -Perfect, I think that's a great idea. Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry, but your card has been declined. You know what? It's gotta be a mistake. -We'll take care of it. -No, no, no, I can-- Let me give you another credit card. Did I bring it with me? I brought the American Express. -Do I have it? -Think you got it. -Clarice, please. -No, I can do it. I'll handle this. Thank you. Thank you. Nice music. Oh, and the food.... l've never been so humiliated in all of my life. -You realize how you made me look? -How I made you look? Well, if I embarrassed you in front of Mr. Big-Time-Development-Head that's too damn bad. Think twice before you open your big-ass mouth talking about-- Big-ass-- lt is irresponsible of you to be over your limit on your credit card. Do you mean to tell me you don't have $200? -l'm done. -While you was recuperating I was the only one bringing money up into this house. I was the one paying bills. Overextended? It's because of you. -This mortgage's about to bankrupt us. -Oh, please, don't be so dramatic. This mortgage is not going to bankrupt us. And as soon as I clean up this little mess you made we will be fine. We're gonna take the insurance money, put it down on an Escalade. I just let you talk me into buying a 300. We ain't buying no Escalade. My clients don't ride in anything but an Escalade, okay? -They're gonna be walking, then. -Hey, hey, hey, settle down. I can hear y'all all the way upstairs. And if I can hear you, the whole neighborhood can hear you. And you know what, Dave? I've been waiting to tell you this for a long time. Maybe if you stop spending so much time with them little gangsters-in-training down there and spend more time in this house handling your business you wouldn't be having this argument right now. You better stop talking about my boys like that. Now, look, I said what I got to say. You know what, Mama? I got this, I got this. David, I have worked too hard to get us to where we are and hell will freeze over before I let you take us backward-- -Know what you need to work on? -What? Work on not being in a fantasyland, trying to be somebody that you not. Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute. -Don't talk to my daughter like that. -That's my wife. -l'll talk to her any way I want. -Don't talk to my mother like that. Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind? I'm out of here. -Wait a minute, Dave-- -Hey, don't you dare run after him. Sometimes when you don't know where to turn you got to turn to what you know. I knew my chair, my records, my music. Only problem is, when the song is over you're right back where you started. I'm telling you, I don't know how much longer I can put up with all this drama. Then why don't you just try to sit Clarice down and talk it all through? I could talk all day long. I think her and her mother are missing the listening gene. Brock Houseman. Yes, ma'am, thanks for calling me back. Look, I was hoping we could talk about-- ls that right? No, no, I understand. I'm just sorry to hear that. I will let him know. Okay, bye. Darius' mom. She said Darnell still won't let the boy back on the team. What's he trying to do? Guarantee his son ends up like him? -What's Julie doing here? -l never thought they'd show up. Well, I'm glad she did. I'm feeling a little leg cramp. -Maybe she could rub it out. -See, there you go. -All right, this is Bryson. -Hey, Bryson. -He's gonna be having fun with us. -Oh, what's cracking, y'all? Somebody be watching too much BET. -All right, come on. -That's enough. Hit the field, let's go. -Nice swing. -That's okay, Bryson. Keep your eye on the ball, give me a swing, make contact. You got it. Here we go. Yo, coach, my little sister could hit that pitch and she's blind in one eye. Oh, come on, my grandma can hit that. -Bryson, come here. -My goodness, you suck. Get off the field, man. Listen, it's okay, all right? I don't want you to listen to any of that. -You hear me? -Yeah. Now, I want you to go back up there. I want it just to be you and the ball. -Okay. -You got that? -Let's go, buddy, here we go. -Okay. -Let's go, come on. -Here we go. See that? Good job, Bryson, good job. Nice hit, dog. Good job, Bryson. Good job. Hey, Julie, I wanted to give you my contact info. You know, just in case Bryson ever wants to come back to practice again. -Or when your car breaks down. -Thanks. Or dinner. -Dinner, okay. -Okay, no. -Coffee, doesn't have to be dinner. -No, it's not that. It's just I probably should just stop you right there. I feel like I've dated you before. No, no, no, I would have remembered that. No, not you, your type, and I.... l get it, okay. You just wanna cut past the foreplay. -lt's okay. -Okay, I guess, l-- No, I know what you mean. No offense, because I really appreciate you fixing my car. But I just don't have the time or the energy. You know, dating's not my thing. My kid's my thing. So if I were to get into a relationship it would have to be with someone who could be a potential husband and a father to my son, and I'm pretty sure that's not your thing. No, I.... -Well, I could do that. -You could? -Sure. -Okay. Bryson, grab your bag. We gotta go. Okay. You're not gonna stalk me now, are you? -Not unless you want me to. -l think I'll take a pass on that. I'm really glad we had this conversation. Cleared everything up. Call me, okay? -Good job out there today. -Bye, thanks, coach. She will not leave me alone. -l'm telling you, she wants me. -Yeah, I could see it all over her face. -Can you? -Yeah. Really? I don't know what I'm gonna do. College boy, what the hell you want? Got a beef with me, let's do it. Don't kill your son's future because of it. What I do with my son, that's my business. I'm making it my business. Knock that victim chip off your shoulder. Or Darius is gonna end up just like you. Your punk ass would know all about that too. When are you gonna stop blaming the world for punching my college ticket? Didn't nobody force you to sling that crack. What I do with my son, it's my son, it's my business. Well, give your son an opportunity. Hey, and the next time you come up here you better come up here strapped. Talking that beef garbage. Carmen, I've been looking for two days for you. For two days, Carmencita. I inquired at the factory, and you were absent. Why do we have to watch this? Can't we watch something else? Girl, shut up, you know we ain't changing this channel. Hello? Yeah, hold on a second. To the magi- - Magistrate. To the magistrate? He'll send me to prison. I can't go to prison. It's just he died in the prison. And I had no money to survive-- Coach, hey, can you come to my swim meet Saturday so I can show you my stuff? It would have to be in the afternoon. We have a game in the morning. Okay, cool, I'll see you at the pool. Give me that phone. I'm so sorry, honestly, and if it's too much pressure-- No, no, look, it's no problem. Tell him I'll be there. Oh, I know. Believe me, I know. -Are you seeing this? -What? Since when he gotta go outside to answer a phone call? I'm not afraid of hard work. I'm a good, honest, working girl. But who would take care of me--? Honey, I spent too many years with your raggedy-ass daddy to know when something's wrong. See this? These movies had romance. Good movies, good writing. I'm ready to go now, soldier. Please take me away from here. -This scares me, David. -What? This. The silence between us. I was thinking, with our anniversary coming up maybe we should just get away for the weekend, you know? Because I know it's been stressful since the accident, I know. It's been a lot longer than that. Okay, that's fair. I've never felt some of the feelings I'm feeling and I just don't know how to deal with them. I guess what scares me the most is you pulling away like this because it's not like you, David. Can we talk to someone about it, please? If that's what you want. Since the accident, I know I've been a little difficult to get along with. I know that. And I've been depressed, you know? And that should be understandable. I'm getting over a major injury. But David's pulling away and I don't know why. l-- l feel like he's doing it on purpose. Like I've done something. Like he's paying me back for something I don't even know I've done. And then he spends all of his time with these boys, this Little League team. And that's time he could be spending with me at home. Working on our marriage. Dave, what do you wanna say to Clarice right now? I mean, what's the point? You heard her. She has everything figured out, so.... You see what I mean? This attitude is-- lt makes my skin crawl because that's not us, bishop. We used to talk things through. We talked about everything-- No, no, we never used to talk about everything, okay? You used to do all the talking. I used to sit, listen to her and her mother cackle. Cac- - He has no respect for my mother. -Let's just-- -Mama loves you. No, no, she doesn't love me, she tolerates me. Because she loves you. But I'm cool with that. -Can't believe you just sit up in this-- -Dave, Clarice. Why do you say that, Dave? Well, the truth of the matter, bishop is that I feel like I'm just visiting this marriage. See? See? I mean, nothing I ever do, nothing I ever say is ever enough. -Oh, God. -That's honest. -Please, that's David being dramatic. -Clarice. -You should get an award for that one. -Clarice. What irks you about Dave coaching those Little Leaguers? He's never home, bishop. You know? He's always with them. He's always with those boys. That's all he cares about. You mean like what a father would like to do if he had a son? Maybe. -But he knows we can't afford children. -No, we can afford kids, okay? If someone didn't live beyond their means, we could afford kids. Please, David. Look at us, look at us. Trying to fix our marriage. Do you really think a baby is gonna help? -l used to. -That's enough. Are you finished? Do the two of you remember how I told you on your wedding day how hard life can be? Well, that three-stranded cord I wrapped around your shoulders that day, will always be there. Unless, of course, you've chosen to remove it. Does that feel good? Dave. Are you okay? You were moaning. Yeah, I was.... l'm gonna get a drink of water. I guess that makes it ours. -Yes. -Oh, I love it, Clarice. And you managed to keep it alive while we made up our minds. Well, actually it was Michelle here who kept it alive and that's why she's gonna share in the commission. -Well, thank you. -Okay. -l've got to get to the courthouse. -No, you don't. You first have to see new tile samples for the master bathroom. I got a full caseload. Court won't wait for me. The tile samples. Yes. Yes. Okay, Clarice, what's wrong? We just closed one of the biggest deals of your life and you walking around like somebody stole your bike. -What's going on? -Nothing. -l'm fine. -Nothing, yes, it is. Tell me, come on now. This is me, tell it. It's-- l'm just having one of those days, okay? Just.... Do not make me go Oprah on you, because I will. I think David's having an affair. -What? -Yes. Oh, honey, are you sure? Yes, Michelle. I can see it in his eyes. It's always in the eyes, ain't it? And it's my physical therapist. What? That skinny little white thing? -lt's Julie Sawyer. -Okay. Oh, girl. What? You got to go over there and open up a good old can of soul-sister power on her narrow behind. I can't do that. I don't have any real proof. We got to go over there and snatch her. Michelle, I can't do that. Snatch her by her hair and squeeze until that heifer tell us everything we wanna know, okay? You want me to do it? Look at me, look at me. Don't go all Waiting to Exhale on me. Dave is too good a man for you to lose. And you don't want to do something all crazy that you can't take back. Now, you take that from me. I know. Don't tell me Todd is cheating too. I did the cheating. -What? -l know. Don't look at me like that, I know. How--? How was he able to forgive you? It was not easy, okay? It took a long time. But he forgave me, after all that. And I will never sacrifice his heart like that again. Yeah, well, that's good for you guys but I just don't think I have it in me to do that. Yes, you do. Now, are you sure you don't want me to go snatch the white girl? Why are you so crazy? I'm just saying. It'll make you feel better. -No, it'll make you feel better. -Yes, yes, it will make me feel better. Oh, my friend. -l am so sorry. -Me too. Maybe we should snatch Dave too. Just do a drive-by snatching, and snatch everybody. You can do it. -lt's all right. -Way to go for it. Good job, Bryson. Let me tell you something, Bryson. You were a beast up in that pool. -Thanks, coach. -l can't wait to come to another meet. Well, I'm here all weekend if I keep winning. The finals are tomorrow. Hey, Bryson, wait up. There is a rep here from the Junior Olympics. And I want you to meet him. -Are you serious? -You're on your way, young man. Okay, well, go. We'll be out here waiting for you. Okay. Hey, listen, thank you so much for taking the time to come out here today and-- l mean, it really means the world to both of us. Hey, a deal's a deal, right? Hey, Dave? Don't take this the wrong way or anything but we single girls are experts at a few things. -Like what? -Like good men. I was telling Clarice just the other day about how all the guys like you are already taken and that she's a very lucky woman. Thanks. Can I ask you a question? I saw your college photo at the house. What happened to your baseball career? Anterior cruciate ligament happened to my career. -Oh, man. -Yeah. I was sliding into home plate. My knee went one way and my body went the other. Along with my dreams of making it into the big leagues. Well, at least you're passing those dreams on to those Little Leaguers. Yeah, somebody's got to take care of them. -And that you do. -That I do. And who takes care of you? Hello, hello. -Hey. -Hey. -What are you doing here? -l can ask you the same question. I was just bringing flowers. I never brought flowers before in my entire life, just so you know. And they aren't for you, my married friend. Yeah, well, I didn't think so. Okay, I think I'm gonna go check on the boys inside. Oh, they're beautiful. Hey, these flowers don't mean I'm stalking you. No, they're beautiful. Yeah. -We had a conversation. -Okey-doke. Okay, that's weird. Clearly I don't have a chance with this girl, which is deeply baffling to me. So seriously, man. -What are you doing here? -What am I doing here? You don't think I see what's going on here? You got everything a man could want. A gorgeous wife, beautiful home. And you think that that makes it all good for me? I just don't want to see you screw up your life. Too late for that. My life's already screwed up. Dave. Who takes care of me? -Hey, Dave. -That's a damn good question. A question I didn't have an answer for. Hi. You didn't notice the candles? -Reesie, l-- -Come on, baby. You remember the candles. When we first got married, they were always my signal to let you know I was gonna put something on you. I know. I know it's been a long time since I lit my candles for you, I.... You don't have to do this. Baby, we need this. I sent Mama on a long errand, so she won't be back for a long time. Come here, please. Like you said, it's time for us to get back to the loving part of our marriage. -Oh, baby, I want you so bad. -Stop. -Are you sleeping with her? -What? I'm not stupid, David. -Are you sleeping with Julie? -No, I'm not sleeping with her. Well, then, what is it? What--? Since when have you had to take phone calls outside? What are all the phone calls about, anyway? David, what's happening? Tell me the truth. Things haven't been right between us and I think we both know that. I know that. So I'm not gonna lie to you. I do have some feelings for her. That's worse. She's taken your heart from me? So, what do you want me to do? I don't know, David. -Clarice. -How could you, Julie? -What? -How could you betray me like this? -Betray you, what--? -l respected you. I thought we were friends. Okay, I gotta stop you right there if this is what I think it's about. Dave and I are friends. Just like you and I are friends. Nothing more, nothing less. We're just friends. Girl, as much as I would like to snatch you right now I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna rise above this. But let me make myself very clear. Stay the hell away from my husband. You wanna blame someone for your problems? You didn't need to leave your doorstep to do it. And you certainly don't need to come to mine. Oh, girl. In case you didn't hear me the first time stay away from my man. Yeah. -Yeah, come on. -Here we go. Take your marks. -Come on. -Kick, kick, kick. Go, Bryson! Come on, Bryson! Keep pushing! -Come on, Bryson! -Go! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, he's done it! Oh, my God! Why don't we say it's a draw? Let me ask you this, man to man. Ain't nobody in here but me and you. Who gets that baseball scholarship if we back in the day? You do. But I was a better athlete. Right. So you think all the hell I've been through was my fault. Man, everybody got problems. See, you just don't know how good you got it. You talking about Darius, right? I'd trade that scholarship and everything I had for a son like Darius. Oh, hell, no. Yeah, that's right. That's right. We putting you out of here. And don't think Clarice is gonna change her mind. What you doing, you old woman? -Old? Oh, no, hell, no. -Mama, please! No, no, no, let her talk. She's always had an equal vote. Why change it now? What is wrong with you? You got this beautiful black queen right here. What in your mind makes you think you gotta go out and get a white woman? Shut up and mind your own business. -David. -No. He been living high on the hog leeching off your money for years. It's time you got his black ass out of here. She more of a man than you'll ever be. So you just gonna stand there and let her say that to me? Clarice. You are just gonna stand there and let her say that to me? Well, then you're right. It is time for me to get out of here. Because I don't give a damn about this house your money or this marriage. I'm done. Dave. Hey, where you been? I've been trying to call your cell. There was an accident. -lt's Bryson. -What happened? I don't know, he went into the wall too hard. They rushed him to the hospital. It's bad, man, really bad. Come on, I'll drive. -l should go. -You ain't going nowhere. Go on in the house. Coach. Please, what are you doing? No, no, no. Please, no. No, no. Oh, please, God. She's all alone. I don't think she has anyone to help her through this. She has us. "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil." "My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." Amen. Clarice, be honest with me. In the last meeting I had with you and Dave I asked you a very important question. Yeah. Has God been the third strand in that cord I wrapped around your shoulders all those years ago? No. Well, without that third strand you find yourself sitting here alone. Your mother is a good woman. But because you listened to her in matters of your marriage that acorn hasn't fallen too far from the tree. Now, I got to go bury this child. But, Clarice you're in the right place at the right time. When I drive through this city and hear the sounds of sirens and alarms going off I see the looks of panic on the faces of people I don't know. I realize how afraid we all are in this world. Life is so unpredictable, fragile. We're only alive one breath, one heartbeat at a time. And so when death comes to one of us it comes to all of us. Because it's the one thing we all have in common. Sooner or later, it's the one place we're all headed. And even though some of us believe that life doesn't end on this side of the grave our grief drives us to hunger for a human touch. Mama, what's that? is that a picture of Daddy? Let me see that. Give it here. -So you still love him? -No. That's a piece of him I keep as a reminder that I made the right decision. Do you miss him at all? Do you remember that cheerleading competition I won? I remember all your accomplishments, Clarice. What you want? That was the same weekend Daddy left. But all I remember you saying-- Don't start dredging up all that mess. That's good riddance to bad rubbish. All I remember you ever saying to me was how he cheated on you and how he was a horrible husband. Never really got his side. Finally talked to Daddy, and he said that he never slept with that woman. He said you drove him out of the house, Mama. He didn't sleep with her until after- l'm not having this conversation. -Why? Because my bedroom drama with your daddy ain't none of your business. Excuse me? The way you're all up in my marriage? You convinced me to put my husband out of my house. I think it is my business, Mama. Don't talk to me like that. Okay, all right. You wanna know? Yes. Your daddy was rotten. You were too young to understand what was going on in that house. He was a nasty bastard. -Mama-- -Don't "Mama" me. He hit me in my face. Now, you listen to me real good. When they stay, and they done already left they get mean. I hated your daddy. -Mama. -No, I hated him. I hated him! You were right to throw Dave's ass out of here before he hits you. No. No, David's not like that. And that wasn't the way to handle that. I shouldn't have listened to you. I shouldn't have listened to you. I'm not gonna talk about this. I'm not. Black women have to be strong and you know that. I don't know what kind of pain you are holding on to in your heart, Mama but you need to let it go. You need to just let it go. And in all your lessons about how I need to be strong and proud and independent, Mama you left out some very important things. -What? -How to love, Mama. How to really care about somebody. How to forgive. I cared about you. I loved you the best I could. I gave you everything in me that he didn't take. And he took everything. Can't you see that? I know you did, Mama. And if that ain't good enough for you, then I'm sorry for you. No. Mama, I'm so sorry for you. I didn't mean to come out here and disrespect you, I really didn't. But it's time for me to grow up and I'm gonna have to ask you to leave my house because I want my husband. I want my husband back, and I want to fight for my marriage. Because, Mama, I don't want to end up like you. I don't. I'm gonna pray for you, Mama. I love you so much. Little girl. You pray for yourself. I'll be gone when you get back. Go on. Okay. Okay. I'm not sorry about what we did. I love you. -Please leave. -Not until we talk. We can't. If Shawn comes up here and.... -He can never find out about this. -He won't. Then why are you even doing this? Hey, hey! Hey, come on, Dave, knock. -You scared me. -What are you doing here? What do you mean? Why didn't you knock? I just came by. Talked to the manager. I told him I was your probation officer, he let me up. -So, what are you doing here? -l can't come by to see my friend? I know what you're going through. I wanna make sure that everything that you are going through is cool. -Make sure you're copasetic. -What are you watching? Just something to make me feel better. I had-- Vanessa kicked your ass out, didn't she? First of all, that's just crazy to even think that she would kick me out. Okay, why would she kick her husband out? Her husband, the man she's supposed to love. Can I tell you what she said to me? Can I tell you what she said? -Listen, look at me. -What did she say? She told me I'm too emotional. I'm way too in touch with my feminine side. No man should apologize to nobody that much. My feet, she don't like my feet now. All of a sudden my feet is a problem? But her back, I can accept that? -You can't accept my feet? -Here's what I want you to do. Go back home to your wife. No, I'm gonna make her think I'm cheating. You need to go back home to your wife. -Why don't you--? -Go back home to your wife. Can you talk to me? Listen, can you talk to me for two seconds? Why can't me and you get in touch, figure out why this keep happening? -l'm emotional now. -Good men. -Good brothers. -Emotional, here we go. We're good black men. -Got my toiletry bag? -Here you go. -Because I don't want to-- -Here we go. I love you, I don't tell you enough. -Here we go. -All right, you right. -Thank you, Dave. -Have a good night. Do you got my toiletry bag? Okay. Hello. Thank you for coming. And thank you for taking care of everything. l-- l couldn't have done it. Are you okay? I think he was so focused on winning and that medal, he.... His coach told him about-- Why didn't I remind him? "You have to take the trash out when we get home." What? That's the last thing I said to him. Before the race. "You have to take the trash out when we get home." Not "l love you." Not "l'm so proud of you." Not "l'm so lucky to be your mom." "You've got to take the trash out when we get home." -lt's okay. -No, it is not gonna be okay. It's-- lt's never gonna be okay. Oh, my God. lt's just not gonna be. -lt's all right. -You can't make it better. Just stop. It's not. lt never is. Wait, no, wait. I can't do this. I know. I'm sorry. I know. Now, you tell the crew for me there are four ways of doing things onboard my ship: The right way, the wrong way, the Navy way, and my way. If they do things my way, we'll get along. -Aye, aye, sir. -Okay. Oh, the manager gave me a key. -l can leave if you-- -No, no, no, it's cool. That manager would give a key to anybody. David, I just need you to let me say some things, okay? I have been round and round with my heart and I want you to know two things. First of all, Mama has lost all of her voting privileges in this marriage. And, second no one ever taught me how to be one of those wives who holds on to her man's every word. And no one taught me how to trust him to take care of me, you know? I really don't know if I could ever be that woman but I do want to learn how to be your partner. And whatever you decide I need you to know that I can't live without you, David. I don't want to live without you and I love you so much. Come here. What's that? I heated you up a plate because you're staying in a roach motel and I wanted you to eat. -l cooked it. -You cooked it? -Yes. -There ain't poison in this, is there? You're not gonna eat it? You're not gonna eat the food? Hi. What up? What up? You know, I was hoping, man I can get Darius back on your team, you know? It's like you, you know-- You helping him to be a better man. Why don't we both do that? Darius, where you at? Okay. Listen, I got you back on the team, man. Yeah, and I got you a new glove. So I want you to come back home and be there by, like, 5:00. And.... l love you, man. You know? Yeah. All right. I found out that if you wanna know the purpose of a thing you can't ask the thing to tell you. A car doesn't know why it's a car. Only the manufacturer favourite underwear. The pair with the rip in the right butt cheek from stepping on 'em in the airplane bathroom when you had the trots? No, with the hole in the left butt cheek from holding it in for two hours cos it was a long church sermon and I thought blowing gas would offend Jesus, so I let it go in the vestibule and it sounded like Louis Armstrong. Oh, bottom drawer. Tell Mother Maggie what you want to be when you grow up. - A scientist. - A novelist. A Cambridge don. What's my future, coming from these squalid surroundings? Fighting with a dude at the Laundromat because he hit on my baby's mama? I should be there, not here! London. Dad, can me and Meg stay up late every night when you're at KISS-Stock? Do whatever you want. Just don't eat from the candy tree. He's right to caution you. I feed on children. You don't mind watching Stewie for a few days? Nah. Since Jolly Farm Revue came on, he's been distracted. - It'll be a breeze. - Bye, everyone. My stupid parents are spending five days following stupid old KISS around. It's painful. Not as painful as a tyre iron upside your head. - What? - I'll miss you! Hey, Stewie, what do you want for lunch? "Dear stupid dog, I've gone to live with the children on Jolly Farm. " "Goodbye for ever. Stewie. " I never got a chance to return that sweater Lois gave me for Christmas. " "The receipt's on top of my bureau. I'm probably over the 30-day return limit, but I'm sure if you make a fuss, they'll give you a store credit or something. " "It's actually not a horrible sweater. " "It's just I can't imagine when I would ever wear it. You know?" "I also left a button on the bureau. " "I'm not sure what it goes to, but I can never bring myself to throw a button away. " "I know as soon as I do, I'll find the garment it goes to, and then it'II... " "Actually, could it have been from the sweater? Did it have buttons? Hm. " "I should wrap this up before I start to ramble. OK, goodbye for ever. " You know, it might be chilly in London. I'm going to take the sweater. " Oh, my God! One of these planes must be going to London. Queue up, children spit-spot. Here are the tickets, miss. These are all ours. Spit-spot, Albert Hall, meat and two veg, Big Ben, Dave Clark Five, pip-pip, cheerio. - Hot towel? - Yes, thank you. Well, come on! - What the hell are you doing here? - Taking you off this plane. Think again, Rover. Great. I'm stuck on a transatlantic flight with a petulant runaway. Could it get worse? You know what I hate about flying? The peanuts. First of all, you can't get 'em open. Who are they trying to keep out of these? And what's with the razor-blade slot in the bathroom? Do people really shave in there? Hi. Andy Dick here. Excuse me. I've got to get my bag up in the overhead bin here. Oh! Whoa, no, no! Oh! Wow, that's wacky! That wasn't so bad, was it? Did you sleep at all? - A little. - I couldn't. My pillow smelled like farts. But that's all right because we're in England! Uh-oh. But where are its verdant fields, rosy-rumped maidens and bucktoothed solicitors? About 3,000 miles that way. We're in the Middle East. - Where are we going? - I'm not familiar with this Arabian village. Stuff for sale! Bad, cheaply made stuff for sale! Hey, Americans. You like movies? I've got Dude, My Car Is Not Where I Parked It, But Praise Allah, We Are Not Hurt. Camels for sale! This one owned by a little old man who only drove it to mosque on Sundays. Just had its knees replaced. - Buy one and let's get out of here. - Buy one? All I've got is 50 bucks. We'll have to distract him. Follow my lead. "You and I are so awfully different "Too awfully different to ever be pals - Do you want to go first? - Yeah. "Your favourite hero is the Marquis de Sade You're one to talk. "You get a stiffie from Phylicia Rashad Oh, one time. "I've a style flair, just look at my hip hair - That's quite a nice do there. - Oh, thanks. - For me to poop on! - What? - You look like Charlie Brown. - Bite me, Snoopy. "There's not a whole lot that we've got to agree on "Cos I love the strains of a classical score "And I like that singer who looks like a whore - Ricky Martin? - Love him! "We're too different to ever be pals! - " You and I are... - " Doo doo doo - " So awfully different... - " Doo doo doo - " Too awfully different... - " Doo doo doo - " To ever be pals... - " Doo doo doo doo doo doo dooie doo "Your head's as massive as a meteorite Oh, very funny. "You have a weenie like a Christmas-tree light "I'd bet money you'll marry a honey "Who's pretty and funny, and her name'll be Ted - A gay joke. - I work with what you give me. "You might think we're in sync, but we stink as a duo "Cos you get a kick out of carnage and guts "And you get a kick out of stroking your... - You can't say that on TV! - What? Ego? "We're too different to ever be pals Oh, man, we're screwed. We're lost in the desert. We have no food, no water. Our camel is dead from exhaustion. And I had named him and given him a back story. Chucky had the biggest hump of all the local camels, and was picked on for it. Then there was a drought, and Chucky went to the oasis at great risk cos he was like that. He drank and stored enough water in his massive hump to slake the thirst of... Cut the maudlin crap. We're in trouble. It's below freezing and getting colder. We're gonna die unless... - Unless we do something drastic. - What? We have to slice open our camel's stomach and shelter in his entrails. Eviscerate Chucky? ! I won't do it! - We'll die if we don't. - All right. Oh, God! It's like Orson Welles's autopsy! All right, just hold your breath and go. - What are you doing? - Wiping my feet. I don't want to track sand in. Once you get it in there, you can't get it out. Oh, God! I just threw up in his lung! I know it's gross, but when you're staring death in the face, you have no choice but to... Oh. There's a Comfort Inn. - Really? - Yeah. Good luck for us, huh? Actually, once you feng-shui the organs, it's kind of cosy. - Isn't this exciting? - Hey, anyone got a light? Thanks. - Look. There's Dave and Dottie, the nudists. - Hey there, Griffins! - Dave, Dottie, what a pleasant surprise! - You're KISS freaks, too? KISS Army soldier since 1977. How about you? '76. I don't think anyone knows more about KISS than I do. - What was that? - It's not important. - Let him answer. - No one knows more about KISS than I do. - Keep it civil. - I'm not sure I like the tone of your voice. - Well, throw down. - Name Gene's special-effects mentor. Amaze-O the magician. What school did Paul go to? New York High School of Music. Their band before KISS? Wicked Lester. What year were KISS on The Jim Nabors Halloween Special? Trick question. It was Paul Lynde. 1975. Recite the ad that brought Peter to Paul and Gene's attention. "Drummer willing to do anything to make it. " Rolling Stone, October, 1972. - Exemplary! - Rock and roll! How in the hell are we gonna get out of here? - Are you going to finish your red paste? - No. - What about your sweet, crusty thing? - Have it. No more balloon for you! I am sick of you tooling around the village in it, honking at the girls, blasting your 1980s American rock music that we got last week. - But, Father! - Go to your palace! - You know what I'm thinking? - Yes. Just wait until they have to suffer through Jesus Jones. Pee-yew! - Not that. The balloon! - Oh, yes. The balloon. Let's take it. - I didn't know it really looked like that. - Neither did I. Such lovely printing, too. Oh, Lois, here comes the best part. "And have a wonderful... time Is that it? No, no, it's... "And... something something... all day Right? - Oh, man. I've lost all faith in mankind. - Music is dead to me now. - Hey, now's our chance! - Let's do it! Where the hell are we? Pope... Pope! - It's time to get up and put on your hat. - It's a stupid hat! - Pope! - All right, OK. God! - Pope, the floor is not a hamper. - Man! It's time to go on the balcony and address the people. Aargh! We gotta find the American Embassy to help us get home. I have no intention of returning to that disgusting hovel with that intolerable woman, that fat slob and that insufferable dog. Oh, you're right here, aren't you? I stand by it. My future is with Jolly Farm! - You really think that, don't you? - I know it. We've got three days until Peter and Lois get back. - Let's go to Jolly Farm. - Now you're talking! You make the pope look like a fool! God will make you pay. Smite them! He's cooking something up. I say! Brian, look. Three rows down. - What? - Is that Tom Bosley? Why would Tom Bosley be on a train in Switzerland? I'm almost certain. Tom! - Did he look? - I don't know. If I yell, you have to watch. Tom Bosley! - No, it's not him. - Oh. Besides its beautiful historic architecture, Munich was ze home of many great writers, such as Thomas Mann. You'll find more on Germany's contribution to ze arts in ze pamphlets. Yeah, about your pamphlet. I'm not seeing anything about German history between 1939 and 1945. - There's a gap. - Everyone was on vacation! On your left is Munich's first city hall, erected in 15... What are you talking about? Germany invaded Poland in 1939. - We were invited! Punch was served! - You can't ignore those years. Thomas Mann fled to America because of Naziism's hold on Germany. - No, he left to manage a Dairy Queen. - That's preposterous. I vill hear no more insinuations about Germans! Nothing bad happened! - Uh, is that a beer hall? - Oh, yes. Munich is renowned for its historic beer halls. - Why is everybody glaring at us? - Why, Lois? I'll tell you why. Your faux pas at the concert was so upsetting, I had to call a professor to tell me what phrase to use to describe it. - Use "faux pas". - Thanks, Professor. You've lived a lie all these years. You represented yourself as a KISS fan. - And why? To make me look foolish! - No, to make you happy. I wanted to share in all aspects of your life, but I just was never that big a KISS fan. I should've guessed when you were willing to dress as Peter Criss. No one wants to be Peter Criss, not even Peter Criss! I guess I'm just not as cool as you thought I was. I guess not. I'm exhausted. Come on, let's get a coffee. - The smoke is so acrid. - A man can hardly breathe in here. You should get some hash, man. You can't go wrong. Not true. Ground meat can go very wrong for me very quickly, and everyone will suffer the consequences! You are out there, man, in the ether. I'd love to further pursue our palaver, but I'm not fluent in "freaker"! So, I'm just gonna turn back over here, back towards my table. - Are you hungry? - I wasn't when I came in. - But isn't that so funny? I'm getting there. - Same here. I think the only reason we die is... Dude, I know what you're gonna say and I am so... Wait, wait, wait, wait! Shh-shh-shh-shh! The only reason we die is because we accept it as an inevitability. - D'you think I'll ever find the right woman? - Oh, God! Yes, man! Dude, you're great! Are you ever gonna forgive me? Lois, I am obligated to keep loving you so I will take my rage out on my own body. Let's go to Denny's. Oh, man! I don't believe it! KISS is here! We don't deserve to be under the same roof. Let's go. All right. I guess I could fix us something when we... Chaim? Lois! Do not address KISS unless they address you first! Oh, my God! Chaim Witz? It is you! - Do you want me to sign the left or right? - No, no, no. It's Lois. Lois Pewterschmidt. I knew you before you changed your name. Lois! I don't believe it! It's been ages! Guys, this is the girl I told you about. I knew her before we formed KISS. Loose Lois! - Cool! Loose Lois! - The legend! My Grand Slam was supposed to be with sausage. I never realised you were Gene Simmons, the rock star! You look great. Anyone nailing you now? Yes, my husband nails me. This is him. Peter. - You... are... gods! - Yeah, thanks. Right. We're recording in Boston next month. - You should come on by. - Oh, we'd love that, Chaim. I mean Gene, you big rock star. Bye. Oh, wow! Such a small world. He was a nice boy, and he's still nice. Listen, Lois, what I said before... I've never been more wrong in my life. You are the coolest girl in the world! - My wife did KISS! - And J Geils. - What? - Nothing. There it is! The BBC! This is it. I'll say goodbye to you now. - Well, have a good life, Stewie. - Oh, I shall! Hey, did you ever find out what that button on my bureau was from? - Yeah. Chris's denim jacket. - Ah. I like that jacket. It looks good on him. - OK, we'll keep in touch? - Sure. Well, I have your address. See ya! Oh! There's Happy Hill! What the deuce...? Pengrove! Pengrove Pig! Pengrove, I've come to live on Jolly Farm! Oh, my! The magic tome! It's cardboard! There are no words, there are just... What is it you've drawn here? It's Oswald Owl slammin' Mother Maggie in a Chinese basket, eh? Dead brill, eh? - Mother Maggie, something's terribly wrong! - Whose stinky brat is this? That's not your voice! Your voice is lyrical, like the strum of a lute! Piss off, ya grotty little wanker! - It's a fake! It's not real! - I thought you should find out on your own. I feel like such a fool. Don't even look at me! Hey, come on. You wanna get some ice cream? That'd make you feel better, right? You wanna get some McDonald's? You wanna take a dump in Mother Maggie's shoes? OK, let's go take a dump in Mother Maggie's shoes. - Jolly Farm, Stewie. Don't you wanna watch? - The Stewie who loved Jolly Farm is dead. Meet the Stewie who loves funky fruit hats! Oh, turn it up! Mom and Dad are on! We're back with KISS Forum. I'm with the Griffins, and they got something to share. - Yeah. My wife here did KISS. - Get outta here! - Hand to God. - Peter! How does that make you feel? I feel like I've done KISS, too. And it feels good. Lois, you got any tips for the young girls in the audience? The best advice I can give is, you never know who's gonna grow up to be famous, so make yourself available. Cool. Well, that's our show for tonight. Stay tuned for Battlestar Galactica Forum. Welcome to Battlestar Galactica Forum. Visiontext Subtitles: Karin Baker ENGLISH SDH is this the one we saw in the ad the other day? There you are. You liked it and here it is Isn't that right? Let me serve the breakfast "l must leave now, love. - Already?" "Bye, sweetheart. - How about the outing, Papa?" "The outing...? Tomorrow, dear. - No, Papa. Today!" You promised her for today. Have you forgotten? "l'm helpless. I can't find the time. - Today, Papa..." "Tomorrow, I promise. No engagements. - Leave immediately..." or she'll kick up a fuss. I'll take care of her. Go on "All right now... you could've at least said a proper good-bye to Papa, darling" You mustn't cry. Can Mama take you for an outing then? Where do you want to go? is it fun? Papa? Where? "Mama, call out to him" "l've always told you, Shekhar. We must tell Sarita everything about us" How would that help? I know Sarita very well She'll never accept you Hush dear... quiet "Now look Shekhar. Whatever Sarita says to you, just keep quiet. Please" "Even if she asks you to separate from me, just agree to it" "Because she has the first right to you. - You have as much right to me, Renu" "Neither can I separate from her, nor you" "lt's time Sarita faces the truth. - You're wrong, Shekhar. You know..." "Now look, she must give you as much respect as you give her..." You... "you are terribly hurt, aren't you?" Which is why I didn't want to tell you Your daddy did a lot of favours to me I couldn't refuse to marry you I did my best to forget Renu But destiny brought us together once again "Forgive me, Sarita... forgive me" "Sarita, there's another thing" "My Shalu has no one else in the world. Accept her, Sarita" Who would be a better mother than you? For my sake... "give me a promise... give me your word, please" There is laughter... there are tears "life is all about joys and sorrows" "There is autumn and there is Spring..." seasons come and go "lf one sleeps, protected..." another craves for compassion lf one is distraught... another is showered with love lf there is pain... there is a balm "life is all about joys and sorrows" "There is laughter, there are tears..." "life is all about joys and sorrows" Memories of days gone by... continue to torment us "Like shadows, they come to haunt us..." "like shadows, they go away" "loneliness casts a pall of gloom..." "for life is all about joys and sorrows" One is forced to live... for there are social mores "There are days when you gain and lose..." "days when there are promises to keep" Restlessness overwhelms... "life is all about joys and sorrows" "Life is all about joys and sorrows" "Hi, sis. You look great. - l'm trying to" Why're you so nervous? - l told you Officers from the bank I applied for a loan from are coming to see me today So what's there to be nervous about? One look at you and they'll give you the whole bank... "and say, "You may repay the money whenever you wish to" "And don't repay it, if you don't want to" How often have I told you Shalu...? - That I mustn't slide like this "l can't help it, Mama. I always forget" "Just talk to them with confidence. - Not confidence, Ma. Over-confidence" Over-confidence is the trend nowadays "Don't joke about everything, Shalu. Not everything in life is a joke" But... - l wonder why she talks nonsense "All right, I'll leave" See what junior has done! I wonder why you like dogs so much Because you don't like them "ln any case, is there anything about me that you approve of? What do you like?" "Whatever I say is wrong, whatever I think is wrong..." whatever I wear is wrong... and I think it's wrong for me to even stay here "See? She does it deliberately! - Let her be, Mama" "Rangeela, looks like she's had a problem with her mother again" Shalu... did you have another argument with your mother? "What is the matter, Shalu?" Want to see her happy? - Oh yes "ln that case, tell her rightaway that you're in love with her!" "Sure... no, what if it spoils her mood even more?" Keep getting scared and you'll keep me company all your life! Tell her! "No, I can't tell her. - Either you tell her, or I will!" Shalu... - One moment. I'll tell her "Shalu, there's something I want to tell you" "Shalu, I... - What?" "Actually, I... - Go on, Sameer" Well... I have a special show! I want you to attend it "You will, won't you? - You're an ass!" "Okay, I'll surely come" Forgive me for calling you over for a meeting at such short notice But this is an emergency "Khanna lndustries has paid the farmers of apples such a low price, this year..." that the farmers have started an agitation against them I tried to telephone Mr Khanna. But despite the best of my efforts... Efforts! Efforts is what you have been doing for the last fifteen days When will your efforts end? When the apples have rotted? When people are already starving? Why ask her? She's of no use! What are we to tell the farmers in our village? What do you mean? - They're rich folks... how would they understand the sufferings of the poor? There's no point in talking to them. It's of no use! Please try to understand the point I'm making "What's the matter, Principal? What's the fuss all about?" "How do I explain, dear?" Mittal and his men are taking advantage of the situation... to dislodge Sarita-ji from the Mayor's chair "l assure you, should you choose me as the mayor..." I'll see your troubles vanish. - l'll make you the Mayor! What are you doing? That much of chilli will set their tongues on fire! is that all? And now? - lt'll come out of their ears! "Sarita-ji, whatever happens, I'll raise my voice for my people" "l'll see that they have their right, because I don't wear bangles like you" "Fantastic, Uncle Mittal! After that fiery line, you must surely take a break" "Coming up... yogurt-fries, made specially by me" Try some. - No "Sit down, Uncle Mittal" "Here you are. Urvashi, serve it to everyone" "Had I been the Mayor, I'd immediately solve..." "Tasty, isn't it?" What happened? "lt's excellent, dear!" One won't do... here's another. You too... I've made it "This is only the beginning, Uncle Mayor. Have more..." Chilli! What happened? Try some more. What happened? "What is the matter, Uncle Mittal? Have another" Come... look at what your daughter has done! Look at her misbehaviour! "What's all this? - No need to pretend, lady" "You're the one who did all this! - Watch your tongue, Mittal!" "Quiet! - But he's a cheapskate, Mama!" He wants to instigate people against you and himself become the Mayor "Fantastic, Sarita-ji! Nice way of humiliating me through your daughter!" Let's go! There's no meeting take place here! "Please hear me out... - You'll have to pay for this, Sarita-ji" "You surely will! Let's go, everyone! - Go away. Get lost!" "Whatever happens, you can never be the Mayor!" "Shalu, what insolence is this? - This was the only way..." "of straightening out Mittal, Mama. - lt's your way, maybe" "With what you've done, you've left no stone unturned in humiliating me!" But it was only for... "You will do nothing for yourself, and interfere in my affairs" You will be able to achieve nothing in life! Go away "Get lost, I say" Are you very angry? Even with me? You mustn't cry Sit down lt's okay if Mama scolds me But why does she say such nasty things to me? "Am I her enemy? - No, Shalu. That's not how it is" You're mistaken. - Am I really? I'll show you Look. How lovingly Mama holds you and she doesn't even touch me Look at this... it's the same story even in this one Look at this... this! And this is what I have endured since my childhood! You're only imagining the worst. It's nothing else "Sis, the one who has to endure it, will know how it feels" You have always got love from Mama. But I...? I feel as if I were picked from a fair Mama loves you as much as she loves me. I can't hear such things against Mama Because that's just what I'm going to tell you Don't ask me for any money! - l won't! Mama's side-kick Don't vent your anger on me. - Mama's side-kick! "Rangeela, she hasn't turned up yet" She's not coming! Sit on your thumb! One mustn't stay where one is not respected l'm leaving! What a predicament! I don't even have the money to leave home! God! Have mercy on Shalu God! Have mercy on Shalu I don't want aims "So where are you all set to go? - Sameer has a show, he has invited me" Have you asked Mama? "My darling sister, that's your department." Take care of Mama. - l'll think it over I'm getting late. Here I go! "Even if you say nothing, my love..." your eyes do convey... your love for me "Your eyes do convey your love for me" "Even if you say nothing, my love..." your eyes do convey... your love for me "Your eyes do convey your love for me" "Why are there beads of perspiration on your forehead?" "Do not lower your gaze when you see me" "l know, you do pine for me deep down in your heart" "Your eyes give away your love for me" Face to face with you... I felt shy I was tongue-tied... such was the effect on me "Every moment, I wait for you" "Your eyes give away your love for me" These folks from Japan think you're a great artist They want to take you along to Japan. - What? "No, I'm not going" "Sameer, at least think about me" "When you go to Japan and make a name for yourself, won't it make me happy?" Don't you want me to tell the whole world that you are my Sameer? So that's how it is! Here we go then... to Japan! This is great. You do look nice in those clothes you pinched from me "Got any money on you? - Yes, I do" But may I ask... where is the royal entourage headed? On work. - What? Why not? Can only Mama and you work? I want to prove it to Mama that I can achieve something too But where are you going? - Khanna lndustries But they're in the red and they're sacking people "Obviously, because I haven't been there yet" See what happens when I get there. Khanna lndustries is going to thrive "How will you find a job there? - No place on earth, sis..." where Shalu won't find a job! - Shalu... "Yes, Mama?" "Khanna lndustries... Shame! Shame" Fulfill our demands Mr Roopchand Khoobchand...? Someone's here to see you. - Who? "Junior, it's some Shalu. She says she has an appointment" Only the Food Inspector was supposed to come today The new Food Inspector? We've had it! We have trouble out there and here's the Food Inspector... Call her in! - Send Shalu in "Junior, show me the stock-statement. - At least comb your hair!" What comb? - Your wig! Great hair! Straighten it. - Why're you doing that? It looked nice the way it was. - lt was turned around That was a different style... absolutely novel How about my hair? - Yours is nice too... but they won't turn around like his. - They sure do... look! You like our hair so much? - Oh yes They're real! - When did I say they're fake? Please sit down... what can we do for you? Don't ask. Just send for something hot or cold "Hold it... Sweetie, send some tea and fries" "Madam, it was nice talking to you. - Me too" You and we are going to work together! - Absolutely. That's what I want too Just tell me what my job will be. - The Food Inspector before you... "Mr Badhudhi, he came inspecting us only once every month" "With his eyes, ears and mouth shut! - Just don't worry" I'll write a better report than he did "With my eyes, ears and mouth... everything shut" That's nice of you! - Child's play for me Just tell me how much money you will pay me "You do talk about everything openly! Must say, women are fast nowadays" "We have a budget of 10,000 Rupees. - 10,000...?" Every month. We'll pay in advance. And in cash "Here's 10,000 Rupees. Count it" "There's no need to count it, but I will" Sure. Go ahead! "What? The Food Inspector can't come? But she's already here, you moron!" "A man...? One moment! You aren't a man, are you?" There's a misunderstanding. I'll find out and call back Who are you? - Shalu I'm Roopchand! "My brother, Khoobchand. - Aren't you the Food Inspector?" When did I say that? - Set it right! is mine okay? - One moment. Mine? Cheat! Fraud! What are you here for? For the job. - Job? How dare you come in here? - For a job! I want to pull your company out of the red and... You get out first! - You're making a mistake You're going to regret it... listen to that "Roopchand... Khoobchand... Shame! Shame!" Fulfill our demands Calm down. Calm down! Beat them up! Stop it! Calm down We're with you! We want your welfare... Stop rioting and go home. We'll do what we can "All right, we'll go away. But we won't spare you..." if you don't settle our demands by tomorrow! Let's go! Wasn't he acting tough? - He'll quit doing that... who does he think he is? - So what happens tomorrow? "What else? They have just two ways, Junior" Either let the apples rot or sell at half the price and make money "Mittal sure had a brainwave, brother. - True" "lt's only a matter of time, Junior. The day Khanna lndustries is sold..." "Mittal will buy it and make us his equal partners, as he promised to" What a great day that will be! What's she doing here? She was listening to our conversation. - What if she tells someone? Let me ask. Wait "Hey Shalu... what are you doing here? - Well, I..." "You haven't heard something, have you?" I've heard We aren't going to be afraid... what did you hear? Everything. - Everything? Yes. Everything. - Now look... don't tell anyone Not even Khanna Uncle? You know Khanna? - Sure I've played with him since I was a child Played with him? - Yes He telephones me every day and treats me like his own daughter So why didn't you tell us? "Send for the tea. Sit down, dear. Sit down" I don't want a job I get out of a recommendation What recommendation? You've been like a child to our master "Mr Khanna is our boss. Brother, that job of assistant manager..." "Give it to her. - A salary of 5,000 rupees" 5000...? No. - 7000. ls that enough? "7000 is all right, but there are no guarantees on leaking information" "All right then. 10,000 is final. - Do we have the guarantee now?" "You won't complain against us to Mr Khanna, will you?" What complaint? Which Mr Khanna? "Terrible day, dad. I've never seen so much of mismanagement in my life" Which factory of mine is like that? - Which one...? All of them are! You've surely been to someone else's factory "As far as I know, not only my managers..." even my clerks are educated guys None of your managers has any idea of Chang's Theory of Productivity Neither do they know about Dang's Theory of Non-productivity Nor do they know about Fang's Theory of Productivity of Non-productivity Now... what's all that about? You know nothing about the theories either "With these CEO's, I have decided to shut down our plant in Palampur" What for? "For the last 5 years, it has been incurring heavy losses, dad" "My son, one must not worry only about his own profits" One must do things even for the welfare of the others "Why do you get so emotional, dad?" "My son, it's because of our factory that people in that city make a living" "Okay, here's what we'll do" I'll go there personally and find out why the factory is incurring losses "lt's okay if we can find a cure. Else,..." When do you want to leave? - l'll go today itself "Dev, will you go there just like that?" "lf you go there as Dev, the truth behind the problems will never emerge" "Dad, I'll go there not as your son Dev, but as Anand, your chauffeur's son" Just give me an appointment letter for the job of a clerk "What's one letter? I'll give you ten, my son" Just get there quickly and take up the job tomorrow Where's Khanna lndustries? Where's Khanna lndustries? Where have I landed? Where's Khanna lndustries? What are you saying? Can't you speak Hindi? "Hindi, Gujarati, French, Italian... you surely know some language?" Keep them away... away! "What's up, mister? You're fuming. - Where is Khanna lndustries?" So you want to go to Khanna lndustries? - l wish to go Delhi! I said Khanna lndustries only to start a conversation with you "This is where you'll get a bus for Delhi, at 8 tonight" Do you know where Khanna lndustries is? They shouldn't have done that. - Who? The bus-conductor. - Why? They have a battle going with the government nowadays... "for a salary hike. But to vent their anger on the passengers, is not done" They must fight the government. Isn't it? "All right, but what is the matter? - What else?" There was this passenger here yesterday who said he wanted to see the Qutb Minar But the Qutb Minar is in Delhi. - l know that too But that's what they told him when he got off. That this is Delhi And Delhi's 300 kilometers away. - 300 kilometers? I've had it! You won't have to travel that far "You wish to go to Khanna lndustries, right?" It's four kilometers away. - Four...? Yes. See that hill? - That one? "Yes, that tall one. - Behind that?" Oh no. Climb down that hill and you will come across a small lake... and then... What was that? - The song the boatman sings Song? - Yes. And listen... don't ask anyone for the address around here They're experts at making fools out of people "No, I won't ask them. I'm not a fool, am I?" "You shouldn't have done that to the poor guy, Shalu" No poor guy. That's just what the arrogant man deserved We're having our laughs here and he must be climbing the hill Say it. - Yes. L... - Say it! - Yes, I killed him. I didn't plan it. He found out I was stealing money from our joint account. He accused me. I got scared and I just killed him. I didn't have a plan, I didn't have an alibi. Why didn't you guys arrest me last year? Oh, that rocked. That rocked, man. You set him up, I knocked him down. Oh, yeah. You are great. You're great. You're great. Don't you, just once, wish you worked for Beverly Hills P.D.? I'll bet you their wires work. You don't like the World War II hand-me-down? You guys still owe me 20... -The lab exploded. -Not my problem. You want the drugs... -Thirty percent... - Damn. Did he say it? I can't hear. Your brother... -Because of you, you son of a bitch! -Stop, you goddamn crazy... My eye! My brother'd still be... What is this? Is this a bug? You taping me, bitch? - You taping me? I'm gonna kill you. - Hey! Drop it! Don't make me kill you! Self-defence, man. Crazy bastard was trying to kill me. - Shut up. - Paul just attacked him. He just ruined everything. I told you he's stupid. He killed Eric, okay? He killed my brother. This doesn't screw up my deal, does it? Your informant attacks me while working for you? Your informant attacks me while working for you? My lawyer's gonna buy a house off this. You were ready to kill Paul. But I didn't. And even if I did, it was self-defence. Why don't we let a jury sort that out? Some kids croaked on meth, right? Put me behind bars, not only won't those charges stick there's a good chance the stuff gets loose on the street. - You sick bastard. - Only when I have to be. Now, we gonna help each other out or what? Why would Ari kill him? He was siphoning off money from the business. Kyle caught him, hand in the cookie jar. He was gonna blow the whistle. - Thank you, detectives. - Don't mention it. It's our job. I'll check in on you in a few weeks, just to make sure you're doing okay. I hope you keep that appointment. It's a lot to take in, I know. I thought I'd be okay, knowing what happened. Doesn't make it any better. Doesn't change anything. He's still not gonna be there when I get home, is he? I just don't wanna be alone anymore. Listen, Danny, I know this is short notice, but I have to break our... - Cancel our dinner tonight. - Everything all right? Yeah. A friend of mine's having a crisis... - It's no problem. - I'm really sorry. I'll just work a double. I can use the extra cash. Great. We'll do it soon. They swept the area. Garbage cans, dumpsters, crawl spaces. Nothing. - What about his place? - No Cupid in sight. We've got 10 pounds of junk still out there and he's holding all the cards. I think this might be a good time for us to start doing things my way. - And what way would that be, exactly? - Hey, captain. Didn't see you there. Someone should put a bell around your neck. - Where do we stand with the meth? - Between a rock and a hard place. Looks like we're gonna have to do this Manny's way. The drugs were right where you said they'd be. Lucky guess. You're welcome for the public service. Pleasure doing business with you, detective. You picked the right day to cross paths with me. I was handcuffed. - Man, you guys got a lot of rules. - You know something? You might not have pulled any triggers, but people are dead because of what you did. You're on my radar now. Okay. Trust me, that's not a good thing. Just have fun tonight. They're all dying to meet you. That's why I'm here. It kills me, Jorge, but this whole thing fell apart. The key witness got cold feet. The investigation's dead. I wanted you to hear it from me. It's not ideal. But it's not disaster either. David, people remember the headlines. Most times they don't even read past them. - This being politics... - Perception is reality. Learning fast. Don't worry about it. I live up to my promises. You're my man, get used to it. I see you at 8. - How'd things go with Mackey today? - Fine. Good. I missed you too, okay? You happy? It doesn't matter to me. How was your day? Shane wants to hit the monster truck rally on Friday. Gotta stop meeting like this. People are gonna talk. Not about anything they heard from me. Hey, might not feel like it, but you did the right thing yesterday. I'm not gay. Julien, come on. I'm not. It's this thing inside of me. I push it down, it goes away. But then it comes back stronger. I shove it down again, but it just keeps on coming back till I don't have the strength to push anymore. I am so weak. I hate this thing inside of me. Julien. You can't go through life hating who you are. I pushed away everyone. My partner, my reverend, Tomas. I'm alone. Hey, no, you're not. You were there for me. I'm there for you. It is so nice to have someone else cook dinner. It smells incredible. Thanks. One of the keys is basil. You have to add it just before it's done otherwise you cook the flavour out of it. - Well, we wouldn't wanna do that. - No. Strainer? Today has been very emotional for you. There's a lot of delayed grief, pent-up confusion, misplaced feelings. I'm not gonna take advantage of that. Hold me. - Hey. - What's up? This whole IAD thing. - I shut you out. Looks like I was wrong. - This thing confused a lot of people. Yeah, I know. Killed my partnership. It's not too late. He's a good kid. Maybe he deserves a second chance. Most of us do. - I'll see you. - Right. - Sir. - Danny. Strike Team's back in business, effective tomorrow. - Did you ever have any doubt? - I did this time. I'm tired, Vic. I just can't keep explaining these messes or cleaning up after them. - Ben. - No. I'm not gonna let myself get burned. We're done, Vic. I just can't have your back anymore. I thought I owed it to you to tell you. Subtitles by SDI Media Group Previously on The Shield: - Someone slashed your tires? - Was the real police busy today? - Any idea who might've done this? - Lamar. He's my ex. Lamar Tilton? We're investigating vandalism to a car owned by your ex-girlfriend. - You mean the tires I slashed? That's my book. The reason I have it is because Matthew has autism. That doesn't mean Vic and his guys didn't steal drugs. - But without evidence... - I saw them pocket cocaine. Cops here will treat you like a traitor. You ready for that kind of heat? - I'll have to be. - We need to keep this under control. I'll talk to my people, make sure there are no leaks on this end. This is an IAD file of an investigation my people are trying to cover up. - Dirty cops? - You'll see it gets publicity. Don't worry, David. I'll make sure they spell your name right. You have an open warrant for your arrest. Don't worry. Your boyfriend'll lock up. Won't you, officer? One Tango Eight in pursuit of a white four-door failing to yield traffic eastbound on Fox Ave approaching Alden. One Tango Two, we will be secondary in the pursuit. - asking the sergeant for permission to take him out here. One Tango 1 3, show is in the area. Paralleling the pursuit on Tambor. CHP is trying to get a tag strip here. There's cross-traffic. This is very dangerous. They've stopped. He makes his way through that intersection. There's traffic up ahead. He's gonna have to take the wrong side of the road! Julien! Don't gun it! Too many people! On the wrong side of the road again! There's a vehicle! That was nearly a collision... - "Cops investigated for stealing drugs"? - I was sick when I saw that. The chief dunked my balls like a couple of doughnuts in his coffee. - You have any idea how this got out? - Yeah. You leaked it! - Me? - You come across like a crusading cop bucking the system. - We're all hurt by this. No one succeeds in this department by being anti-cop. I'm anti-criminal. Even if they're wearing a badge. I must've missed that quote in the paper. What're you gonna do about the Strike Team? Suspend them? - Innocent until proven guilty. - Can't have them running the streets with these charges pending. - And we can't suspend officers without due process. Reassign the team to the general detective pool. - Stick them with different partners. - In the meantime, I'll see if I can figure out who leaked this. - Don't bother. You wanna pack your things now or would you like a few days? Firing the one cop who actually cares about cleaning up the department. I wonder how the chief would like that headline. You got it all figured out, don't you? - Howdy, partner. - Slumming with us ordinary detectives. Don't get too excited. It's just temporary. Promises, promises. Looks like we're running together today. - Yeah. - There's traffic up ahead. - He's trying to get... - Northbound, over. It's coming our way. Block this intersection. - When we're clear, cross the street. - Shouldn't I follow? No, you're trailing. Pull up and over. They'll tell us when to converge. Time to converge. What the hell am I supposed to talk to Shane Vendrell about all day? It's good to shake things up. I don't wanna shake things up. I want my partner back. Aren't you sweet? Well, absence makes the heart grow fonder. You're gonna miss me too, right? I called it in. ETA, three minutes. Back a block! Danny! - Broman, pop the trunk. - Got it. God! Oh, God. Could've used a higher sunscreen. God! The story's even worse than you said. It's all in there. We're screwed! Give me till the end of the day, this thing goes away. What're you talking about? We're gonna have to make this thing go away. - Heard you guys found a crispy critter. - It's a miracle he's still alive. Must've had it coming. You gotta piss somebody off to have them torture you and stick you in a trunk. - Nobody deserves that. - He was probably a rat. - Hey! - Back off! - Cut it out! - Julien's not a rat. - They run in packs now? - What is your problem? - Vic! Hey! Hey! Let's not make this into a bigger mess. Come on. Come on! Lay low, man. Do your work. Leave this thing to me. Hey. Hey! I'm still here. - Julien... - I hear you. - Well, you gotta help me out. - Nothing I can do. - How did that cop know about us? - I don't know. Pulled some strings. Got you released until your court date. - You did? - Yeah. I just need help with one thing first. I'm filling out my report, and I'm a little confused. When I busted in, it looked like you had some cop's dick in your mouth. That can't be right. Can it? You got something to say, say it to me. Okay. It's easy to make a mistake, especially on a bust. You think you see someone pocketing coke instead of boxes of ammo. - It can be confusing. - He's not confused about anything. - I'm not taking back my statement. - See? And what you're saying that he and me did, it never happened. It never happened. What? Julien. Julien! - You heard him. It never happened. - He needs me. - Aren't you full of yourself? It's over. - That's not what he said. That's what I say. He's got a lot on his mind right now. He doesn't need you complicating things. Stay away. - You can't keep us apart. - I've seen your sheet. Small-time con men like you only care about themselves. Yeah, well, he cares about me. You don't want me hauling you in every week. That's what you care about. So cut him off. Oh, man, look at this guy. I ever get that bad, pull the plug with both hands. - Not me. - What? You'd want that? No, but it beats the alternative. Just keep my machines juiced until the Hoover Dam's out of business. - Detectives. - Dr. Crawford. How's the poor sap? Third-degree burns over 60 percent of his body. He's gonna die. Here are his things. The skin showed traces of red phosphorus and hydrogen chloride. - He blew himself up in a meth lab. - Seeing two, three of these a month. Every bozo from here to San Bernardino thinks he can cook crank. Don't know what you're doing, boom. Meth. Courtesy of Cupid. - How lovely. - Meth's the drug of the day. We've got a few ODs in the ER right now. Could you take us down there, give us a look? - Oh, he's tweaking. - Third one today. - Could I see the patient's belongings? - Over here. May we see the patient's belongings please? Thank you. - Call me if you get any more. - I will. Cupid's busy. Looks like our mummy cooked up some crap before blowing himself up. Let's hope he's dumb and lazy. No telling how much he churned out. Got another college kid. - How do you wanna play this? - We both have our own ways that work. - Why don't we just take turns? - Take turns? We follow one lead your way, next one my way. Your way's not gonna land me in the papers, is it? - Don't believe everything you read. - Okay. Who goes first? - Ladies go first. - All I know is the ID of the driver so let's start with his family. - Lead the way. - David. - Jorge. - There's no turning back, huh? - I know I've burned some bridges. - Now's the time to build new ones. - How so? The good news. This headline is exactly what we needed to brand you for the voters. - It came out well. - I've decided to back you for City Council. I was hoping that's what this was about. Thank you. I would like you and Aurora to join me for dinner tomorrow. You can meet the rest of your team then. - I have a team? - We have a lot of work ahead of us. The celebration on Cinco de Mayo will make a good coming-out party for you. Jorge. I promise, I'm not in this to lose. You can't afford to. Don't believe everything you read. You gotta wonder where they come up with this stuff. - Anything break yet? - Nope. There's a crack den on Temple due for a toss. Wanna hit it? I wish I could. I've gotta go over some open files. Alrighty then. Danny! How was the sergeant's test? I don't know. It's gonna be close. I kind of froze a little. I'll bet you did great. Listen, pass or fail, I do want to thank you for tutoring me. - Can I buy you dinner tomorrow night? - Sure. Great. Tomorrow night. You pick the place. - Can I help you with that? - Sure, yeah. - Can I help you? - Yes. I'm looking for Det. Gannon. I've been leaving him messages for the last two months. Det. Gannon retired last year. Well, he was investigating a case. My husband was murdered. - Here, have a seat. - Thank you. I haven't heard anything in ages. I couldn't understand why he wasn't returning my calls. - What's your husband's name? - Kyle Kelner. I'll pull the file. I'll be right back. So you lost your husband. - Year ago today. - I'm so sorry. I don't understand. I mean, why would Andy run from the police? He had a burn victim in his trunk and methamphetamine in his pocket. This doesn't make any sense. This is from my daughter's rubber-stamp kit. You didn't know your husband was involved in this? He's a web-page designer, not a drug dealer. He and his friend Eric have been looking for jobs ever since the company they worked for had gone bust. - Who's Eric? - They went to college together. I tried to reach him when I saw the chase on TV but I can't get ahold of him. I'm afraid I might know where to find Eric. - I can't even look at him like that. - It was a meth-lab explosion. What? Meth lab? I knew that my brother was having money problems. You know, but how was I supposed to help him? He's the one who went to college. Now they're asking me to end his life. What do I do? Thanks for standing up for me earlier. That's what partners do. Even if you don't agree with them. - Don't agree with them? - Look, this is a brotherhood. Everybody knows that but you. - You don't know what I been through. - Because you don't tell me. Decide if you wanna stay partners. If you do, start opening up. If you don't, talk to Aceveda. Car's clean. He turned me down when I asked him for a new partner. Maybe he'll give you a different answer. - Here's an unserved warrant. - Year-old lottery ticket. Weight Watchers coupon. Like that lard-ass would ever use it. He just dumped his desk drawer into this box. Clock ran out on this case a year ago. I'm not shoveling ice off the clue trail. - Well, we owe it to her. - No, Gannon owes her. You want me to fly solo? No, man. Looks like this is the only action I'm gonna get today. - Excuse me? - The "I lost my husband tragically but I'm young, hot and in need of an emotional release" sex. - You're kidding, right? - What? You've never covered some homicide and gone back later for a statement? This one's been hanging on the vine for a year, man. She is ripe. - Get out of here! She's with me now. - Just give me two minutes, man. - She say you only last two minutes. - As long as it takes to whup your ass. - Hey. Hey, hey, hey! - Tell me, what? ! - What you wanna do, then? - Wait a minute. You guys again? Weren't you with you and we busted you for slashing his tires? That's the past. Today you need to be arresting him for trespassing. You gotta own something for me to be trespassing, welfare nigga! - Man, my job is getting nasty with Fran. - Come on, Fran, don't do this, baby. - We together now. What you want? - Fran, give me two minutes, girl. - She's not giving you two minutes. - Give me one minute. - We're through, Hooper. - Fran, don't do this. - She's not giving you the time of day. - Don't do that, Fran. - He don't deserve you, girl. - Get on inside. Come on. Fran. Come on, now, don't do this, baby! Finishing the marketing plan. Has to be done before I fly to Houston. - Don't think you're getting any. - Is that any way to talk to the next city councilman? - Oh, my God. Machado said yes? We're having dinner at his house tomorrow to meet the team. The team? Oh, David. I can't believe it. So why aren't you more excited? This is my shot. I won't get another. You won't need another one. Power is an aphrodisiac. Died about 20 minutes ago. Second, so far. Third one scrambled his brains, and all from the same college. We better find this stuff, or you'll be stacking them up in the freezer. - Ambulances bring them all in? - All but that one. Who brought him? That guy over there. Police. You knew the OD victim? He was rushing my frat. I'm the pledgemaster. This part of rush week? - My father's a lawyer. - Mine was a bricklayer. So what? Fowler, Coughlin Rose. You wanna talk to me, talk to them. We are definitely doing this one my way. Get the hell off me! - You want him to be your brother? - Yeah. - Kiss your brother. - Stop! - Where'd he get the meth? - Please, no! - Where'd he get it? - I don't know! Fine. Kiss your brother again. We gave it to all the pledges! It was supposed to be funny, sending them to class on speed. - Jesus. - Where'd he get it from? Effi. Effi Montecito. He deals to all the frats. Good. Now let me show you how we haze our pledges. Detective Gannon left a long list of TBls to be interviewed. So we're starting from scratch. What exactly was your husband's business? Property management. He owned condos, rented them out. And he was found at a construction site? Yeah, he and his partner Ari were building a new complex. Was he meeting someone? I don't know. I... I had just gotten home from my parents' when the police called. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Here you go. - Thank you. - I'll get you some chips. - Thanks. Have you talked to anyone, like a grief counselor? Didn't help. - I know some that are very good. - I don't know. It's already been a year. But it feels like it was yesterday when you got that call. Our dealer Effi is a 25-year-old still living in his old frat house. - Can't seem to grow up? - He'll grow up fast in San Quentin. Real fast. It'll take a few hours to get the warrant. I'll start. Not a problem. I got some errands to run, anyway. What's going on? This IAD thing's still hanging out there. I told you. I'm not changing my statement. - I'm willing to keep your secret. - Sure you are. I am. What do you think, I'm gonna twist your arm? - All you gotta do is... - Lie? It's not a lie. You made a mistake. We put boxes of ammo in that bag, not bricks of coke. I know what ammo looks like, and I know what blackmail looks like too. - It's not gonna work. - I got nothing to lose. My guys have taken fire from every scumbag in town. They're going down because some rookie thinks he saw something? I did see something. I'm not gonna let you destroy their lives. So you're gonna try and destroy mine? You're not giving me any choice. Handing in this arrest report is the only way I can think to stop you from making a huge mistake. - That report doesn't prove anything. I don't have to prove you're gay. In this house, all I gotta do is say it with all the gory details. - There you go. - All right. Vic! - I'm not sure they stole any drugs. - What? It was dark. They were at the other end. My view was obstructed. You never said your view was obstructed. Well, it was. You didn't see Mackey put two bricks of cocaine into a weapons bag? I can't be positive. You didn't see Shane Vendrell drive off with that Chester took it. Took it like a champ. SIN-DEE: Let me tell you, Chester is a natural born sailor. DINAH: If you trying to upset me it's not gonna work. I give zero fucks about you and Chester. Oh, bra! He was all he could be when he joined my Navy! Does your friend ever shut up? No. That bitch been talking ever since I met her.

Yee! - See, i remember that. - Hey, don't get used to me bringing you tea. Oh, you've seen "drive," right, the movie "drive?" Uh-Huh. - Yeah, buddy. I'm so happy right now. Oh,mygod, you're so-- - Nicole got it, made for me. - That is hilarious. How dope is this shit? Come on, man, you know it's dope. Good,giveme aline. Give me a line. He doesn't say anything, like, the entire movie. Well, give me the look. You got to put the jacket on. Okay, wait, wait, wait. - Man, don't-- - I can't look at you. You're not- - You're not gonna be very good at acting At this point, okay, cool. I feel that. That was the look? You don't have no words? He really didn't say shit the whole movie. So we finally got to the top of the hill. Tenyearsago, everything was so fast-Paced. Youdidn'thavetimetorest. Youdidn'thavetime to think. Youdidn'thavetime to eat. Crazy kid. Everybody was sick of each other, And everybody wanted to do their own thing. We'realloldernow . So much has happened. We'veseenthebest and the worst of each other For20years. My whole mantra coming into this Is i just want to be proud of the music that we're making, And the shows that we're putting on and have a blast. Enjoy it. One,two,three-- Wedon'thavearecord deal. It's awesome. It'slike starting all over again, Having the freedom to create something from scratch. Thisissomething that we felt like Wewantedto do ourselves. It'sourmoney. Sothisnewchapterthat we're embarking on Is, to me, exciting, At the same time, crazy and scary. It'sa bigyearfor us, Kevin'sback. Wehavean album that we got to release, 20thanniversary, brand-New tour. It'shuge. Weusedto showup and they'd say, "Goinandsingthis ," Andyou'dgo in and sing it. Theproducerwould make it sound magical, And the record executives picked the singles And there was no decision making. Whenwewerekids, it was different. We were told were to go. We were told what to do. We were told what to say. And now it's like, you know what? I do have a voice. I want to think for myself. I want to make music for me. Youknow,iwanttomakemusic for our fans. Iwantto make everybody happy. I'vebeenin thisband for more than half of my life. I am the first, the original old school backstreet boy. Imetloupearlman in 1992. Hewasprobablyone of the wealthiest men Inorlandoat thetime, an entrepreneur. You know he was just an all around wealthy, Wealthy man. Youknow,louhad seen the success of boyz ii men, Jodeci, new kids on the block, And i think once that got in the back of his head, He was like, "well, i can do this." Icanputtogetheragroup-- Fiveprettyfaces that can sing and dance. And that's exactly what he did. Louwasgivingus a $75 week check, And i still have it in my mom's house framed. It was the first check i ever got. Itwaslikeaperdiem, And 75 bucks for a 14-Year-Old's a lot of money. I'dbeenworking on a solo career Sincei was6yearsold. Itwasdefinitelybetterthan working at universal studios Or disney's back lot, you know, or mcdonalds, that's for sure. Ireallyhadthischoice between being a mouseketeer, $50,000 contract, or doing this thing with lou pearlman And the backstreet boys. Mymothergavemethechoice. I don't know why she left that decision Up to an 11-Year-Old child, but it just kind of happened. Ididn'twanttogrow up and be a backstreet boy. Itoldmy momwhen i was a little boy Thati wasgonnagrowup And play for the university of kentucky basketball team. Iwasworkinginorlando, florida, walt disney world. Iwasaninjaturtle, aladdin, played goofy, Butdreamedof being a recording artist. So this was a huge opportunity for me... a shot, a chance. Louownedsomewarehouse spaces out here - In this industrial park-- - He was leasing them. He was leasing them, that's right. Which we're gonna try to see if we can manage to find. Um, it's been many years ago. - We're gonna try to find them. - Almost 20 years ago. This one. I think it was on michigan, guys. - No, i think it's-- - I think it's this one. All i know is i got lost coming here the first time. I almost didn't get in the group because of that. So maybe don't ask me. Hi, guys. I remember this area, though. I remember that church. It is down on this road, i'm telling you. Then we trust his memory and none of the old guys. Yeah, this is it. - Holy crap. - This is it. It is. We're here now. 26/42 We were busting our fucking ass in this warehouse here, Day in and day out all day long. Itwaslike a wood stage that we put up. Wehadabunchofmirrors. It was hot as hell. Itwasaconstant work in progress. Wehadto be workedon. Oh, oh, yeah! Weputin somecrazy hours in the early days. Thebackstreetharmony, the blend, Itwasalways a work in progress. You know, it was something that We had to, kind of, find. Irememberhowie in the very beginning. Hewasprettymuch the lead singer. Andthenbriancamein. Hehadagreatvoice. Withouthim,youknow, the blend wouldn't be the same. Thevoicesarefive. They create a chemistry, a sound That is unlike any other. You just knew it, like this makes sense. This works. Our voices blend perfectly. Ithink i'm getting stronger. You know, i think i'm getting better. You know, i think you've helped me a lot Which has been good. You get this jaw working a little bit. And you let your jaw hang down and back. The blessing that we're gearing up for a tour, And, you know, the backstreet boys' world Is, you know, about to explode again. You know, but yet it's still pressure. - You know because it's this anticipation of... - Right. You know, brian's got to be brian. You know, i wish there was a magic wand That just could-- Not with these mind/body-- Not with these mind/body connections Which is right where, you know, right where the problem lives Is right in between the nervous system And the mind. Justbreathe. La la la... uh-Huh. Let it go. You know my voice is, you know, it's my life. You know, we take it for granted, - Because it's just something that's given. - Right. And... and for me it's, um, It's not a given right now. It comes and goes. It's hard for me to talk about to be honest with you. Um... i try to... i try really hard to be optimistic about it, Um, but i'm faced with it every day. Um, the doctor mentioned Vocal tension dysphonia, Which is the tightening of the muscles Around the vocal chords Which 'causes the vocal chords not to work correctly. It's frustrating. It's very frustrating. Because i want to you know, i just want to be me. I want it to be easy. And i want to have the carefree attitude, You know, that i had years ago. Hereweare with the backstreet boys. - How old are you anyway? - I'm 16. - And how old are you? - 19. - And? - 20. - 20. - And? - 14. - Ooh! Lou pulled every resource he could with this And pulled as many strings as he could To get us to be as big as we could be. Hehadallthesethings Thata richbillionaire entrepreneur should have. We'rea bunchof youngguys that's like, Going into a frickin', like disney world. I mean, every time we all would hang at lou's house, It was a different adventure. Hehadthisunbelievable, like, arcade/movie room. That had a cool pool table, One of those old-Fashioned coke machines. It was the best damn tasting coke you've ever had life In your life. It was so good, in these glass bottles, But it was like, an old-Fashioned one. And then he had this-- The original darth vader mask. Attheendofthenight , we'd pull out one Of lou's porns and we all watched those every so often. The first time i'd seen two girls even kissing each other Was on one of lou's videotapes. And i was like, "what is this?" I'm like, "my eyes are gonna burn." I can't even tell my mom about this. Hi,lou. - Wow! I'm on candid camera. Hello. Hi. Louwasbigpapa. He was like another father to a lot of us, Like kevin, especially. You know, because kevin was the only one, at that time, That didn't have a father. He allowed me to quit my two jobs and pursue my dream, And i'm very appreciative of that. Weallclaimtoknow everything about each other, Butthere'sstill so much left unsaid, Somuchleftunlearned Sowhilewe wereinlondon making the record, Wetalkedaboutdoingthese little hometown trips To really kind of go back to our grass roots To kind of see where everybody really came from. See these places, experience it together, And get that bond tight again. Wegonnapartytonight! Come on, y'all should stay! That'swhattheysay . Andthey'rehaulingbutt in that thing. I'll do it. All right, this is where i grew up. Myfather was the manager of this camp, Andwelivedon the property year-Round. I would look out at this grass right here And up at those trees and envision a crowd, Like an arena, and like i was a rock star, And i'd have a broom in my hand And play air guitar and just imagine like the trees And the grass is like-- Yea-Ea-Ea-Ea-H, ooh! I lived here until I left for florida in 1990. We lived in this house right over here. This is like where my dad, you know, Kind of spent his final days. When i was living in florida, My father had had a-- Was diagnosed with cancer, But they didn't tell me and they said He just had a little surgery, Somethingwasup with his stomach. Theydidn'twanttoworryme. A couple of months after that my mom called me And said that, "you know that thing that we told you Your dad had a little problem with his stomach? Well, we didn't want to worry you, We didn't, you know, want you to worry, But it was cancer, and it's come back And it's not doing very--" I know what you went through, bro. So i came back home And my father had been in that bed for, I don't know how many weeks, and i pulled up... pulled up in my car And he hadn't been out of bed in weeks, And he didn't want me to know how bad he was doing So he met me at the front door. Yeah, so anyway, that's just my dad, You know, he didn't want anybody to worry about him. Hewantedme to go back to florida And do what i was doing. He didn't want me to stay up here to watch him die. Uh... so anyway, i spent some time with him Went back home, got my stuff, moved back up here And shortly after he passed away, But my father's all over this place. Uh, great memories living here. Come on down this way. I used to come in here and sing. We didn't have a ton of drama in our household. Mom and dad, they supported us in everything that we did. So not a whole lot of turmoil in the home, Just a lot of love. This is pretty isolated, right? So it was me and my two brothers. In the winter, it can get a little dark and gray up here And get a little depressed, but music, you know, I would hole myself up in the house, And it's so cold you can't go out And play music and that was my window to the world, And i couldn't wait to leave this place. I was like, god, i want to get out of here And travel and see what's out there And experience other places and now that i've done that, And i come back here, and i see how beautiful it is And i realize what a special place And what a special, unique situation it was for me To grow up in a place like this. Alotof it really came into place Whenloubrought in johnny wright. Andjohnnywright was a road manager Forthenewkidsontheblock. Sohere'ssomebody that has experience. Andsaid, "i got this thing Thati wantyouguys to go out on-- Esmhighschooltours." High schools and middle schools all across america. Wehoppedon awinnebago With nobody knowing who the eff we were. I don't know if it makes sense But we're gonna go out there and give it a big shot. Wewent all over the country-- Arizona,pennsylvania, texas, nebraska. I'll never forget we did a show in a school That was 75% black, 20% hispanic, 5% white. Itwaslikeareal inner city high school. Here we come, a bunch of corn fed, like, Middleamerica, straight off the farm boys. And our damn p.A. Went out. Music is like... we had no music and it got out of hand. I'llneverforget there was a group of guys Inthefarback. Theystartedbooingus. "Get off the stage, white boys." You know, throwing stuff at us. Boo! Uh,newkids,wannabes, new kid wannabes. Andwe'reup there on stage, like, Now what the fuck do we do? And brian was like, "all right, everyone shut up! Shut up, shut up! And let us just do what we came to do, That's sing for you." I turned around, look at the guys, And they were giving me that look like deer in headlights. Like, holy- - Boop! We did every a cappela rendition of every song that we knew. Those guys shut up. The girls were kind of going crazy, Which was kind of cool, i thought. I was like, "wow, this is kind of interesting." And even a bunch of guys were like-- "Yo, man that was a great job, man. Lou, much respect." And i was like, "wow!" You know, we did our job. We are a vocal harmony group. We can sing without music at the drop of a hat. We're the harlem globetrotters. Hey, where's- - Do we have any publicity pictures? - Yeah. - Go get some. I want you to go sing something. Whatare you gonna sing? Don't ask me. Five, six, twelve, eleven, What you looking at? Backstreet boys-- I ate a muffin and i got heartburn. It was an unspoken bond that was created Because of lou. Youknow,nickand brian, Backintheday were inseparable. Imean,theywerelike the bopsy twins Whenitcameto, like, harmony and just being clowns Andpranksters. Ifeltlikenick was the little brother That,youknow, i never had. We'dalwaysbe on the basketball floor. We'dalwayslose 'cause we were short, Butyou'dalwaysfind me and nick On the basketball court, that's just where we were. 21to13 , that's a big gap there. You know, i was always the little brother In my family, and now i had four. Itwaslikeacontinuous summer camp. It was just fun. It really was fun. Make some noise for the backstreet bo-O-O-Ys! We thought we were superstars. You know, there were people at our shows? Well,theyweren'teven paid shows, Theywerejustfreeshows. But, again, we thought-- We thought we were stars. Let's go. Yo, let's go. Let's go. They're waiting. We'll catch up. Let's go. Welcome to tate's creek! - Keep it down, howie. - Okay, sorry. Welcome to kentucky. When i was doing wrestling, we'd have practice right here. My teammate he was on my back, We had to run these hills here, and it sucked, man. You'dgetsick and you'd vomit. You'dbelike... how do you run down the hill with somebody on your back As steep as it is without falling forward? You have to sit-- You have to sit-- I could see going this way, but that way? - Let's try. Oh, dear, god. Not with you. He already blew it out once. I'd like to see that right now. A.J., dude, you're gonna blow your knees out. Yee-Ha! Now wait... and now i'm gonna turn around go back up. - My underwear. - Come on! - And the best part-- Whatdoyouremember about performing here, though? 'Causeit- -Remember our suits? Iremember you had a burgundy suit, Greensuit,blacksuit, Goldsuit,purplesuit. Andi hadahorrible caesar haircut. Yep,youdid. - Brian: and curls. - You did. - It was bad, dude. We had a lot of good memories here. It was fun. Isay, that's really nice. Oh,okay. Goodshirt. How much are they? - $7 $7. All right. How you doing, sir? - I'm good. - It's good to see you. - You doin' all right? - I'm good, i'm good. Come... all this was outside. Oh, okay. It was seventh grade-- This was the first day, I remember, that you and me got a chance to meet. It was day one. He hits a note on the piano. He just tells everybody to start singing so we do that, And then he said, "okay, i want y'all to stop singing. And he just kept whittling through everybody Until he got to myself and three or four other young ladies, 'Cause i was sitting in the soprano or alto-- - Alto section. - Alto section. So i was-- Me, me, me, me. And he says, "okay, ladies, i want you all to be quiet." And then he said, "you, sir, you know, go!" And i sang it, and i was a nervous wreck, And he looks up at me and he said, "You can make a lot of money with that gift that you have." Like embrace it, you know what i mean? 'Cause you don't-- As kids you don't know-- You don't know the talents that you have Or how you can touch people's lives If you don't have instrumental people That help shape your vision of what you want for your life, And you did that and in that one statement, And it's been with me for over 20 years now, To be where i'm at, and i appreciate you. Is that right? It was just a clear, very pure heavenly sound That you don't hear that often coming out of a youngster, But i knew his voice was gonna change, And i had to be extremely careful about the direction That i was gonna take him in, so it wouldn't ruin him 'Cause you can actually destroy that, You know, that sound. Sometimes it comes out... and sometimes it doesn't. Ouch! You drawers just went down. I can't throw that that flat ball far! Why not? Yeah, you can. - Oh, dear god. - Oh, that's for-- Yougottago ,dude! Here you go, ready? Repeat. Well, that was fun. Ow. Itisveryimportant you guys work the stage, Connectingwith the audience, Because i think it's important For your 20th anniversary tour right? I'mjustsaying, commend yourselves 'Cause we're working hard. I mean, we fucking did that routine almost 15 times. You know what i mean? We're working it. We'll keep doing it. Yougotto remember when you get out... nick farted, ladies and gentlemen. It was him. It was him. He did it! Thanks, bro. God almighty. Bring the shotgun! - You see you don't-- - You're on the other note. This is ricky. Listen to this. Listen to this, hold up a second, do it again. Nick, don't, don't, you're not helping. You're making it worse. Themusicwe weremaking in orlando was sub-Par. Itwasnotgood. So1995we finallygot a record deal Withjiverecords. The very first producers they set us up to work with Weredennizpop and max martin. They had a lot of success in europe. Theyproducedandwrote most of the ace of base album, And i had that pumping in my car every day. Itwasourfirsttime out of the country ever. I was almost 18. So my mom wasn't with me. Imean,it wasjust the coolest thing. You walk into the studio and you look at the wall And you see platinum records with ace of base, And robin, abba and all this stuff, And you're like, "oh, shit. This is like the real thing." Loualwaystalkedaboutit. Johnny talked about it. Never did i think this was gonna happen, And then it fucking happened. Here we are. We'reinstockholm,sweden. We'reactually,like-- We're making a record. Fromthestudio experiences in florida, It was completely different. Because max and denniz had this sound Where it was like, a eh eh sound. Just this like eh... eh eh. His drums and his baseline, i mean, That shit was funky. Almost old school like parliament funk type sound. I dug it. I was excited. It had edge. It had balls, you know. I was like, "just put me on a song. I just want to sing on something and i'll dance to it." That was my take on things. He had a sound that was definitely, Um, i can be honest, not exactly the howie d sound anymore. Nothing like anything we had ever done before. Released "we got it goin' on" Intheu.S. I think it peaked at like, i don't know, 60-Something, But it didn't really make a dent. Ahhh! All right, give it up for the backstreet boys. Five young fly f-To-The-L-To-The-Y guys. They'refromflorida. Check 'em out. Youguys are definitely destined Forsomebig-Timestardom. Thanksa lot. At that time, radio was playing nirvana And snoop dogg, and dre. So there was no room for boys like us. Johnnywrightsaid, "Ithinkyouguys should go to europe. There's this boy band kind of movement That's going over there." We show up in usa hockey jerseys like, "We're from america. We can save you." And it's like this huge arena. That's... packed. Ourtakewasthesebands are all lip synching. Everyone is lip synching. Let's go on stage, sing for real, Let's show them something they've never seen before. We hit that stage and they went nuts. We were like, "oh, yeah, here we go, boys." Put your hands up and sing! Itwasjustafull-On head spin. It just became like this whirlwind. We would get on a plane go to a country, Do a performance, that same day hop on a plane, Gobackto anothercountry do a performance there, Getmaybelikefourhours of sleep, Wakeupthenextmorning, do a morning show. Thatwastheschedule for years. We'renowin hamburg. Thisismunichbynight. Berlinbynight. The first three years we were there so much That after a while, we ended up having german girlfriends. Thatmeans "it's so good to see you." Howie b. That's me, that's me. If we wanted to communicate The international language of love, We had to learn some words really fast. That's "will you give me a blow-Job?" Wecouldnotgoanywhere, Couldnotgo out by yourself. Policeescortseverywhere, Evenifyoujust want to go out to dinner. Yes, can we have a table for 400, please? I mean, it was-- It was chaos. Ohno,she'sontop of the roof. No,no! Mycar! Oh,mygod! Uh, i guess we're taking her with us to munich. Uh, five hour drive. Don'tdothat,man . Hey, this is gonna happen in the states, too. In europe, we sold 14 million albums off of our first cd, And it never came out in america. You know, you're telling your friends and family "Yeah, we're huge in europe." Really? Imean,i'vebeeninthis business for over 30 years. Igrewup doingmodeling and acting and stuff. Ijustwantedtoperform on stage for people, Anywayicould. This has been a lifelong dream, and here i am Stillmakingmusic with the backstreet boys. You know, everything starts somewhere. I would say everything for me started right here. - Hey! - Oh, how are ya? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. My very first acting job when i was still going here Was at little palm. I did snow white, but they picked me to be dopey, Because i had two speech impediments Anddopey's- -Anddopey was an actual mute. So i just had to learn like little like rain and cold, But i couldn't talk, 'Cause i had a stutter and i had a stupid lisp, But, you know, i finally got rid of it. I still have the stutter every so often. - When you get nervous? - Nervous or if i'm telling a lie, usually. Oh, yeah. Both of you. - Mwah. - I love you. These are my two other mothers, literally, literally, Growing up, i mean, yeah. You still remember your monologues? - I still remember-- Do one for us, A.J. With the accent? Okay. "Many moons ago in a far off place, Lived a handsome prince with a gloomy face, We did not have a bride. Oh, he sighed, alas, And he pined, alas, But alas, the prince couldn't find a lass Who would suit his mother's pride. For a princess is a delicate thing, Delicate and dainty as a dragon fly's wing. You can recognize a lady by her elegant air But a genuine princess is exceedingly rare." Bravo, bravo! Bravo! I look very much forward to working with you In the near future. Thank you. I swear, he is- - You've used that to hit on girls. Yes! I was just gonna say you don't know how many girls... your whole life! How many girls i've used that with Iwouldliterallyhangout with a bunch of girls Andi 'dbelike, "Hey,doyouguys want to see something?" And i would stand up on the bed or on a chair, No wonder you remember it so good. You're busted. I'm like, no, i was gonna call myself out. The dainty thing. I totally remembered that now. It's never gonna go anywhere. He still says it to this day. How do you think i got my wife? By' 97, "we got it going on," "Quitplayinggames" Allbecamehugelysuccessful in canada. And then all of a sudden, It just kind of rained backstreet boys on the u.S. Fans call in, "play backstreet boys, Play backstreet boys." It went from like zero to 60, I wouldn't say overnight, but damn near close. Wewerecomingout of the gulf war, America kind of needed something That was a little bit more uplifting. I think people just wanted to feel good again. America, at that time, was open to the idea Of fresh-Faced young boys Whocoulddanceand sing. Theywereokay with turning the radio on Andjustlisteningtoit without a care. Thatvideo,we looked like a bunch of beefcakes. Wewerewetand had our shirts open and everything. I'mlike,"i don'tknow-- Not i don't know. I know that's not the first impression i want to make In the u.S. Butitworkedout . Someofus bought their first houses, Someofus changedcars from honda civics to mercedes. You became a rock star. You were living that rock star lifestyle, you know. I'm still a teenager 18, 19, like living the dream, dude. I'm having a fucking blast! Don'tblockthedoor, please. I was gonna make me a cup of coffee. Whatifyou- -Whatifyou did that as a tag, Likeafterthechorus? That's cool. Put that down 'cause that's-- That's a better second line, i think. It needs to be, uh, heart wrenching, Or it needs to be dark. Or it needs to be-- I don't know. But then that contradicts if i'm in the spotlight And then you're waiting in darkness, no? No, because the darkness isn't necessarily the light. The darkness is the emotion. Waiting in darkness, i stood with sadness. That'show- -That's how i take it. Youknowwhat? I like the-- Like sing it more like off the fuckin' beat. - You know what i mean? - That's a good idea. - Something like that, yeah. - Uh. Buti mean,we 'renaive to think we could come here Inthreeweeks and cut an album. Yeah,i know. I felt like we we were going in circles. We were optimistic-- - I don't think we were naive. I never in a million years thought that was-- - You're optimistic. - Don't get me wrong, Guys, we're one week in and how many songs do we have? Five almost. - That's what i'm saying. - It's not bad. - Let's-- - No, i know-- It's a shot. Let's just keep-- I think we're getting the cart before the horse here. All right, let's join hands. We're gonna have a blessing. Come on. That's good. Really, for real. Come on. Good to bless the food. Oh, dear lord, thank you for this day. Thank you for the blessings that you blessed us with. Thank you for this circle. We ask that you bless this food To the nourishment of our bodies And bless this record, hallelujah. In christ's name we pray. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Let's toast. Here's to another 20. Yep. And this is ours. - Howard. Whenthegroup first started, Iwasdoingalotmore of the leads. And little by little, when we got with max martin, Our sound changed, so throughout the years I really had a hard time, i struggled with that. I resented the situation. Ialwaysfeellike why am i always having Tobepushed in the background? Iwantedto havemyvoice heard just like everybody else. Perfect. I got a little two in my heart On that one part there. With the new record and the new dynamic I told them, i said, you know what? In order for me to feel comfortable Being a part of this, I really need to be able to not be in the back. I need to be up in the front with you guys. Youjustgottaittwice and you're done. You'rebutter. That'showyoudo. That's howie d. At least my toes look somewhat presentable today. Normally, they're too long. I could fucking climb a tree. It's very embarrassing. Crap! Sorry. A.J.? ! I'm howie. I'm singing all the leads on everything for this record. It's gonna be a great record, don't worry. It's the best ever. Hello there, my friend. How are you doing? Good, i'm good. Doyouremember who this is? Thisislittlehowie. Yeah,howard from down the street. I used to have his mom going, "howie, howie." Yeah, come in, come in. Take care of yourself. Welcome back. When i was born, we had no central heating here. I sweated my butt off. So the first thing i did when we made a little money, I put central heat and air in this house. I was tired of sweating. Dude, look at this. - Did you write that? - I did. Me and my dad. - Hoken howard-- - Hoke d. Howard. Hoke d- - I think i got a little crazy. I decided i wanted to do my autograph on everything. Well, that's crazy, i lived my whole life in this house.

Down the street, actually, um, was one of my first kisses Was his cousin, chelsea. - My niece, my niece. - Your niece. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you, kevin. As a little kid back here, I had a bunch of rabbits. Itstartedoff with like one Andthenithink we had another one, And then like the next year we had like 45 of them 'Cause you know they get busy. My dad called me out here and said, Got to finish off the rest of the rabbits. So i didn't know what he was talking about. Oh,no. So i got my first true experience Of having to kill a rabbit. Oh. I went after the one that was the meanest one, The one that i hated the most. He had like a snaggle tooth And i hated that black rabbit so much, I'm like, if i've got to kill one of these things, You're the one that's going, so i'm like trying to hit him And he's like jumping all around. I'm like- - I'm trying to hop all around, And this poor little rabbit's- - I couldn't do it. My dad's like, get in the house, son. And he'd knock 'em out and just kill it. Dude. - It was- - It was - Soak 'em in salt water? - It was back-Woods style, dude. - Your mom fry 'em up? Yeah, and i couldn't eat it. I couldn't eat it 'cause it was just like-- It was too hard going down. I was 12 years old, and we had to, you know, I'm sure being in the country You probably know how you take care of your own animals And stuff like that and i'd never experienced about five years ago? - Richland? That was three years ago. You can't remember, can you? Leads me to ask a couple of questions. What's the purpose of this team? Win ball games. Then what? We get a trophy. And people talk about us. Maybe. For a while. - Then what? - I don't know. Get a scholarship, play for college and coach Little League. What are you getting at, Grant? You think we're just wasting our time? If our main goal is to win games, then yes. You don't want us to win games? No. Not if that's our main goal. Winning football games is too small a thing to live for. And I love football as much as anybody. But even championship trophies will one day collect dust and be forgotten. It's just that so far all this has been about us how we can look good, how we can get the glory. The more I read this book the more I realize life's not about us. We're not here just to get glory, make money and die. The Bible says that God put us here for him. To honor him. Jesus said the most important thing you could do is to love God with everything you are and love others as yourself. So if we win every game and we miss that, we've done nothing. Football then means nothing. So I'm here to present you a new team philosophy. I think that football is just one of the tools we use to honor God. So you think God does care about football? I think he cares about your faith. He cares about where your heart is. If you can live your faith on the field, then, yes, God cares because he cares about you. He sent his son Jesus to die for us so we could live for him. That's why we're here. But, see, it's not just on the football field. We've gotta honor him in our relationships in our respect for authority, in the classroom and when you're at home alone surfing the internet. I want God to bless this team so much, people talk about what he did. But it means we gotta give him our best in every area. And if we win, we praise him. And if we lose, we praise him. Either way, we honor him with our actions and our attitudes. So I'm asking you, what are you living for? I've resolved to give God everything I've got then I'll leave the results up to him. I wanna know if you'll join me. Your attitude's like the aroma of your heart. If your attitude stinks, it means your heart's not right. He sure is preachy today. What? How's your attitude, Brock? It's fine. Then you'll be okay with the death crawl, right? All right, everybody on the goal line. Get your partner. Let's go. All right, let's go. Show me something. Ten yards. Move it. Let's go. Matt, let's go. Let's go, Jonathan. Show me something. Ten yards. Show me some power. No knees. Keep your knees off the ground. Show me something. Here we go. Ten yards. Show me some muscle. Show me some power. Give me some heart. Let's go. Very good, boys. Very good. Let's run it back. Man. Brock. - Man, that's not even funny, dude. - Oh, yeah, it is. So, coach, how strong is Westview this year? A lot stronger than we are. You already written Friday night down as a loss, Brock? Well, not if I knew we could beat them. Come here, Brock. You too, Jeremy. - What? Am I in trouble now? - Not yet. I wanna see you do the death crawl except I wanna see your absolute best. What? You want me to go the 30? - I think you can go to the 50. - The 50? I can go to the 50 if nobody's on my back. You can do it with Jeremy on your back but promise you're gonna do your best. All right. Your best. - Okay. - You gonna give me your best? I'm gonna give you my best. All right, one more thing. - I want you to do it blindfolded. - Why? I don't want you giving up at a certain point when you can go further. Get down. Jeremy, get on his back. Now, get a good tight hold, Jeremy. All right. Let's go, Brock. Keep your knees off the ground. Just your hands and feet. - A little bit left. A little bit left. - Come on, Brock. Come on. There you go. Show me good effort. That away, Brock. You keep coming. - There you go. - Come on, Brock. - Come on. - It's a good start. Little bit left. Little bit left. There you go, Brock. Good strength. You gotta be kidding me. - That's it, Brock. That's it. - Am I at the 20 yet? Forget the 20. You give me your best. You keep going. That's it. Now don't stop, Brock. You got more in you than that. I ain't done. I'm resting a second. You gotta keep moving. Let's go. Don't quit till you got nothing left. There you go. Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving, Brock. That's it. You keep driving. Keep your knees off the ground. Keep driving it. Your very best. Your very best. Your very best. Keep moving, Brock. That's it. That's it. That's it. Keep going. Don't quit on me. Keep going. Keep driving it. Keep your knees off the ground. That's it. Your very best. Don't quit on me. Your very best. Keep driving. Keep driving. There you go. There you go. That's it. You keep driving. Keep your knees off the ground. Don't quit till you got nothing left. Keep moving, Brock. That's it. That's it. That's it. Keep going. I want everything you got. Come on, keep going. - It hurts. - Don't quit on me. Your very best. Keep driving. Keep driving. There you go. There you go. - He's heavy. - I know he's heavy. - I'm about out of strength. - Then find more strength. But don't you give up on me, Brock. You keep going, you hear me? You're doing good. You keep going. Do not quit on me. You keep going. - It hurts. - I know it hurts. You keep going. You keep going. It's all heart from here. Thirty more steps. You keep going, Brock. Come on. - Keep going. - It burns. - Then let it burn. - My arms are burning. It's all heart. You keep going, Brock. Come on. Come on. Keep going. You promised me your best. Your best. - Don't stop. Keep going. - It's too hard. It's not too hard. You keep going. Come on, Brock. Give me more. Give me more. Keep going. Twenty more steps. Twenty more. Keep going, Brock. Give me your best. Don't quit. No. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Don't quit. Don't quit. Don't quit. Brock Kelley, you don't quit. Keep going. Keep going. Go, Brock Kelley. You don't quit on me. No, you keep going. You keep going. Go, Brock. Ten more steps. Ten more. Ten more. Ten more. Keep going. Don't quit. Give me your heart. - I can't do it. - You can. You can. Five more. Five more. Come on, Brock. Come on. Don't quit. Don't quit. Come on, Brock. Two more. One more. That's gotta be fifty. That's gotta be fifty. I don't have any more. Look up, Brock. You're in the end zone. Brock, you are the most influential player on this team. If you walk around defeated, so will they. Don't tell me you can't give me more than what I've been seeing. You just carried a 140-pound man across this whole field on your arms. Brock, I need you. God's gifted you with the ability of leadership. Don't waste it. Coach. Can I count on you? Yes. Coach. What is it, Jeremy? I weigh 160. All right. Who's next? Good practice, boys. See you all tomorrow. Hey, man, for the first time in a while, I actually feel good about Friday night. Yeah? Why? I'm just on board with what you're doing. If they get a hold of it, it'll change their lives. You count me in. Grant, me too. Yeah? Yeah. I feel like I owe you an apology. I just want you to know that I'm with you. Thank you. See you tomorrow. - You need a ride, Matt? - No, my dad's coming. Or at least, he'd better be. Can I shoot straight with you for a minute? Sure. I feel like you owe your dad more respect. - Why? - Because he's your father. - You don't know him like I know him. - I don't have to. You need to respect him because it's the right thing. You know, coach, my dad doesn't even like you. He thinks the school needs to find somebody else. That's beside the point. Scripture says to honor your parents. - And all you do is complain. - All he does is boss me around. He doesn't even try to understand me. Matt, you can't judge your father by his actions and yourself by your intentions. It doesn't work that way. You're not responsible for him. You're responsible for you. You honor God by honoring your authority. You really believe in all that honoring God and follow Jesus stuff? Yes, I do. Well, I ain't trying to be disrespectful but not everybody believes in that. Religion works for some people but I'm just here because I got kicked out of Westview. Matt, nobody's forcing anything on you. Following Jesus Christ is a decision you're gonna have to make for yourself. You may not wanna accept him. Because he'll change your life. You'll never be the same. I do hope one day you realize how much he loves you. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. I'll get him. Just give me the bag. - Bring that trash bag. Set it down. - Don't you let that touch me. I'm not gonna let him touch you. I'm gonna get him out of here. - Oh, man, he stinks. - I can't believe that was in my house. - Just make sure it's still dead. - It's dead. He's probably been dead for weeks. Oh, there you go. You just get it out of here. Out. Out. - Stop being af- - Come here. Look at it. - No. It looks like a big hamster. Just-- Come here, come here. Don't be afraid. Just face your fear. Look. He's got a cute little tail there. He's just got a big stink. Look. See his cute little eyes there? See his teeth? Look at his teeth. Almost looks like he's mad. You're terrible. I can't believe you did that to me, Grant Taylor. You are so bad. David, right down the middle. You got this. Right, set it up. Run it again. - Sorry, coach. - David, listen, son. You act like you gonna miss before you even kick the ball. See, we're gonna have to change your whole kicking philosophy. Now, see, you're kicking wide left or wide right. But that ain't what's gonna get you home. The ball has got to go through the middle. - I know, coach. - No. No, you don't. Now, what does Scripture say about this? Scripture says: Wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there be that find it. Now, to us, that's wide left and wide right. But narrow is the gate and straight is the way that leads to life, ... and few there be that find it. Anybody can kick it wide left or wide right. My mama can kick it wide left and wide right. - That ain't what's gonna get you home. - Come on. It don't have to look pretty. It don't have to look smooth. It can look like a dying duck. But the ball has to go through the middle. Oh, my word. Now, David, you gonna have to choose the narrow way. That's the only path where you will get your reward. Now send this ball through these pearly posts. Set it up one more time for me, Jonathan. David, I've never heard it that way before but there's a lot of truth to what he's saying. Let's see you kick it. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Grant, are you not aware of what's going on outside on the field? What? You might wanna come check this out. Mitch decided to bring his Bible class outside today. After he started teaching, Matt Prater accepted Christ as his Lord. It was awesome. He started confessing stuff from his life he started asking his friends for forgiveness. Next thing we know, Bob Duke stands up and does the same thing. Kids start breaking up into groups, they begin to pray for each other. They ask forgiveness for sins they've committed. This has been going on for hours. How did you not know what was going on? Bless them in a special way. Lord, I ask you to lift them up to you. I ask you to bring up a generation that has a heart for you, Lord. Coach. - I'm proud of you, Matt. - I need to talk with my dad. I'd like to go see him. I'll take you right now. So, what we've done here is we've gained these four lots by moving the retention pond down here. We could try and do that through here. No. I like this. That's perfect. Mr. Prater, there's someone here to see you. - Sarah, I'm in a meeting. - It's your son. - Would you like me to step out? - No, it's okay. Sarah, send him in. Matt, you okay? I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't know you were in a meeting. What is it, son? Dad, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way I've been acting. I got right with God today and I just needed to say that from now on I'll respect your authority. Whatever you say goes. That's it. You know, I could come back tomorrow if that would be better for you. No. It's okay. I'm sorry. I... For what it's worth I'd give my right arm to hear my son say that to me. I feel like I'm standing before a new team tonight. It's a new day and a new game. What you've experienced in your hearts is about to be released. Stay humble but confident. Why don't you take this one, Brock? Lord, we know our lives are not about football but we do thank you for allowing us to play tonight. Lord, we're gonna give you our best. If we win, we'll praise you, and if we lose, we'll praise you. We'll give you all the honor and the glory for this night. Keep us safe. - Amen. - Amen. All right, guys. Look at me. Play hard, have fun. Hit. Yeah. In the Old Testament, Nehemiah had the task of building a stone wall around his city for protection. But he didn't have enough people or resources or time. But because each person worked on the wall in front of their house they got it done in record time. That's what you're gonna do. On defense you have to resolve nothing gets by you as an individual nothing gets by us as a team. I need you to build me a stone wall. Get on that, D. Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. Roll through there like you're soul-struck. Come on, now. Come on. Hit somebody. I wanna see some hitting. I wanna see hitting. Dig those feet. Come on, you ain't on my team yet. You're not on my defense. You gotta dig those feet. All right, Prater. Get in there, boy. Let's go. You gotta hit him a little harder than that. This ain't ballet practice. This is football practice. David. Double-sweep pitch lift. Pro 45 flex. Man, even a 26 Powerhouse. - Man, these are some good plays. - We're gonna run them. Man, we got all type of potential on this sheet. When? - We're gonna run them, I promise. - Yeah, see? You always tell me you're gonna run them. - You don't wanna run my plays. - Hey. It's all right. Where's my car? - Where'd you park it? - Right here. You sure? Because there ain't no way it got stolen. Man, you couldn't pay nobody to steal your car. - Did the boys do something with it? - Man, I don't know. Hey, man, there's a note on this truck for you. - What does it say? - Let's see. It says, "Grant Taylor, the impact you made on our school means more to us than you'll ever know. The Lord has used you to meet a need in our lives and now we want to meet a need in yours. You'll find the title of this new truck in your name. Please accept it as our way of saying thank you. " Somebody done gave you a truck? Man, this title got your name on it. You got to be kidding me. Grant Taylor, somebody done gave you a new truck. This is my truck? Is this just because you head coach? Because I'm assistant coach. You'd think I'd get a moped out of this or something. Oh, Lord, you've given me a truck. Well, it's your truck. Drive it. Not a word to anyone. Yes, sir. That's right. No more jumper cables. Break. Brock. Brock. - You watch him. You watch him. - Sure. Hut, hut. - Go. - Go. Go. That's right. That's it, baby. You got it, Brock. That's right. - Yes, sir? Can I help you? - Please. I'd like to buy a nice bouquet of wildflowers for my wife. I see. That's awfully sweet of you. Oh, yes. I've got a special evening in mind for her tonight. Well, in that case, you need a card to go with those flowers, don't you? I've got the perfect one. I'm gonna give it to her at her favorite restaurant. Oh, really? I'm sure she'll be happy. Oh, she will. So I need your nicest, largest flowers and money's no object. - You see, I got a raise today. - You did? - Six thousand dollars. - Are you serious? That's exactly the way my wife's gonna respond. Grant. That's awesome. You know, you sure got friendly service here. Hello again, everybody. This is Lane Lavarre, along with Dale Hansen coming to you tonight from Princeton Heights Academy the site of tonight's opening round of the GISA football playoffs. For the first time in a decade the Shiloh Eagles find themselves in postseason play. Coach Grant Taylor's gonna have his hands full as he takes on the Panthers who haven't lost a game all season. All right, huddle up. Stay sharp, stay focused, play hard and honor God. - Eagles on three. One, two, three. - Eagles. Sweep. So after an impressive seven-and-three record the Shiloh Eagles fall short tonight in the first round of the GISA playoffs. Twenty-eight to 10 is the score. The Princeton Heights Panthers take it to the Shiloh Eagles. I knew we were gonna get killed tonight. Your effort was good tonight. You've got nothing to be ashamed of. You played hard. The Shilohs had the best season they've had in a long time. God's been good to us this year. Guys, coach is right. We're gonna praise God when we win, we're gonna praise him when we lose. Let's take a knee. - Hey. - Hey. I wish by some miracle we could have won tonight. They worked too hard to walk away with their heads down. You know, I was hoping God would give us just one win in the playoffs. They deserved it. You know, if you'd told me two months ago that we'd be playing Princeton Heights in the playoffs... - ... I would not have believed you. - Yeah. If you'd told me our school was having a revival, I wouldn't have believed you. - This ain't been a bad year. - Got all the jerseys? All 32 of them. But I ain't ready to put them up, though. I'm ready to go another round. You and me both. Part of me wanted to get to state. - To state? Grant, are you serious? - Why not? As hard as they worked? Well, working hard is one thing, but to take this team to state? - That'd take an act of God. - Has he not been acting already? He has, but do you know who's gonna be waiting for whoever gets to state? - The Richland Giants. - That's right, the Richland Giants. And Bobby Lee Duke will be there with his 85 players ready to spank whoever made it to the state playoffs to kingdom come. - I'm not afraid. - I know you're not afraid. Because you ain't going. Oh, by the way, man, some man called looking for you today. Who? Stan Shultz. - Stan Shultz? - Yeah. Stan Shultz. Isn't that the cartoonist? That's Charles Schulz. I thought Charles Schulz was that man that flew across the ocean in the Spirit of St. Andrew. That's Charles Lindbergh, and it was the Spirit of St. Louis. - No, Lindbergh is a cheese. - Limburger's the cheese. Lindbergh's the man. No, Lindbergh was that blimp that blew up and killed all them people. That's the Hindenburg. No, Hindenburg is where you go skiing in Tennessee. - That's Gatlinburg. - Gatlinburg? You mean like the country music group, the Gatlinburg Brothers? You guys are crazy. Grant Taylor. Well, Mr. Shultz, I was told you were looking for me. Yes. Am I sitting down? Why do you ask? Hey, coach, what's going on here? Coach is on his way to let us all know. All right. All right, everybody. Bring it in. I want you to know I serve a big God and he can do whatever he wants to do. He can open what he wants to and shut what he wants to. A team that plays for his honor and glory will have his blessings following that team. Unlike those who try to cheat their way to the top, like Princeton Heights did when they played two ineligible 19-year-olds. They have been disqualified and we're advancing to the next round. Get your pads on for practice, boys. We're going to war with Tucker Friday night. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the GISA quarterfinals. Who would have thought we'd be seeing the Shiloh Eagles tonight in a contest against the Tucker Tigers? With Princeton Heights disqualified call this an early Christmas present for Shiloh. Offense, put it in the end zone. Defense, build me a wall. - Eagles on three. One, two, three. - Eagles. Blue, 18. Blue, 18. Set. Hit. Hit. David. This is your field goal. It belongs to you. Put it through. We're putting David in. David. Hit. Yeah. There you go. There you go. The Tucker Tigers are nursing their wounds as they face the end of their season. The Eagles, however, have a little farther to fly. All right, what kind of sick are we talking about? I don't know. I've just felt really nauseous the last two mornings. - And then I feel fine again. - You haven't eaten anything weird? Not unless fruit and cereal's weird. Brooke, my gut says make an appointment with the doctor. I've been there three times this year. It's getting embarrassing. I'm just telling you what I would do. You can even use my car. With five seconds left, the score still stands in Oakhaven's favor 17 to 14 over the Eagles. Grant Taylor calls the play in to Zach Avery who pulls the huddle together for their last shot at going to state. It's third down and goal for the Eagles and the crowd is going crazy. They line up in an I formation. This is do or die for the Eagles. Zach takes the snap and will give it to Jacob Hall for- - No, it's a fake. He's got Nathan Markle open in the corner. The pass is up. He's got it. Touchdown Eagles. Touchdown Eagles. Zach Avery completely faked out the defense and made a perfect pass to win the game 20 to 17. Can you believe this? The Shiloh Eagles are actually headed to the state championship. A team with only 32 players has made it to the big dance. Oh, my. On the eve of the GISA football state championship the Richland Giants prepare to defend their reign as lords of the gridiron. It's no surprise they've returned for this game. What is surprising is who they're playing. The Shiloh Eagles who started the season oh and three, have come out of nowhere and through a bizarre set of circumstances now face a team almost three times their size. Sleep at all last night? Are you nervous? It's a weird emotion. Part of me thinks we're gonna get crushed tonight part of me thinks God may do something awesome. Sounds like your fear's about to clobber your faith. Something like that. When are you going out there? I might leave early, if that's all right. Just don't worry about me. I'll just meet you at the game. Okay. Either way, you're still playing for a state championship. Juice. There's some juice. Do you see that? This is? - Apple. - Apple. Good. - Where's the duck? - Duck. - Zebra. - Zebra. Zebra. Cat. Duck. There's the pig. Brooke Taylor's here again. Maybe she'll be pregnant this time. I hope so. - You ready, son? - I can't find my cleats. They're right here by the door. Thanks. You realize you're playing for the state championship tonight? I don't know why I'm so nervous. I'm not even gonna play. You know I'm proud of you, don't you? Yes, sir. Don't ever doubt it. Whether you play or not... - ... I'll be right there praying for you. - Thanks, Dad. Let's go pick a fight with some giants. Here's the results for B Taylor. Oh, I'll take that. - Negative? - Yes. I will still love you, Lord. I will still love you. All right, God. You got us here. Whatever happens, may you get the glory. - Coach, what are you doing here? - You're at the state championship. Any time a former player gets this far, you know I'd be there. - It blows me away. - Well, how you feeling? A little bit nervous. This championship, it's kind of surreal for me. I promise you, I don't care what level of ball you're coaching it's surreal when you make it to the championship game. And Grant, I can tell you, I'm so proud of you and what you've done. I've been reading about the team and where you've gone. And I'm just proud of the fact that you finally learned how to win the big one. - We haven't played them yet. - You won when you accepted Christ. Now, as you're teaching these guys and minister to them I think it's just fantastic. I got it. These players got it. Well, I can promise you, win or lose this game, you guys are champions. - I appreciate that. - But while you're here you might as well win it, huh? I'm gonna try my best. You know, this team we're playing, they're huge. They're fast, they're strong. I just don't want my players to be afraid. Well, in God's word, he said 365 different times, "Do not fear. " If he says it that many times, you know he's serious about it, don't you? I would guess so. I needed to hear that. Well, look, you're gonna do great tonight. I know you're busy. - I'm gonna go and cheer you on. - Good to see you. - All right. God bless you, man. - Thanks, coach. In about five minutes we head out for the warm-up. I wanna say two things. Number one, I love you and I'm proud of you. I wouldn't trade this season for anything in the world. Secondly, you're about to play the biggest team you've ever faced. They're strong, fast and undefeated. So far. But I want you to remember where God has brought us. I want you to remember how hard you've worked. We weren't supposed to have a winning season, but we do. We weren't supposed to advance through the playoffs, but we did. We're not supposed to be here, but we are. So if anything in you says this is a losing effort, throw it out. Because as I stand here, I believe that as long as we honor God nothing is impossible. Nothing. Leave everything out on the field. Give your best to God tonight. Whether we leave the field the victors or not, we will give God the glory. Now who will go fight the Giants with me? You've gotta be kidding me. The Giants elect to receive after the coin toss. We're just seconds away from the state championship game. Dale, it is impressive that Shiloh has made it this far but the field tonight really looks lopsided. It definitely does. I'm looking at 85 players on the Richland sidelines as opposed to 32 for Shiloh. Even if the Eagles had great talent, they can't bring in fresh players. That's really gonna hurt in the second half. All right. Let's go, Joshua. The Eagles kick it off and the state championship game is underway. Jerod House will receive the kick and he'll head down the field. He gets a couple blocks and breaks outside. He's got daylight. But the Eagles will take him down around the 50-yard line. That's where the Giants will set up shop. First down and in good field position to start this state championship game. Get up there. Brock, watch them up the middle. Come on. Let's go, boys. Wes Porter will call the play for the Giants. He steps back to pass. He's got Damien Fuller streaking down the sideline. He lets it fly. Fuller will take the pass in, he will race into the end zone untouched. And the Giants strike early here in the game with the first score. Welcome to state-championship football. Hey, man, this is a whole new level. They are quick off the line. We've gotta stay back. The Eagles will start this drive at the 19-yard line. Zach Avery drops back to pass and he passes to Jeremy Johnson. But the pass is batted down by the Giants. That's right. That's the way we do it. Avery hands it to Jacob Hall, who tries to run up but he gets absolutely nowhere as he is swamped by defenders. Ten, 10, hit, hit. Eagles look to pass. Here come the Giants. They're gonna get the sack. That's gonna force the Eagles into a punting situation on fourth down. Baby, ain't that pretty? Jerod House will receive the kick and he'll head down the field. He breaks outside. He's got some daylight. Okay. All right, time- - Ref, timeout. After gaining eight yards, the Eagles give up another sack. They're gonna have to punt it away on fourth down. Dale, so far it's been all Richland. - I should not have called that play. - They're all over us. Nobody's open. - They're knocking us around. - They're getting cocky. We cannot let them play their game. Defense, blitz on first down. We've gotta get them off their rhythm. Let's go. No. Field-goal unit. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Good job. Good job. Keep it up. What universe are you in? Get in the game. So with a few seconds left in the first half the Giants were gonna take a three-touchdown lead but after an Eagles interception, we've got a 14 to 7 football game. We can't keep running our normal plays. Their defense is killing us. I agree. We cannot outmuscle them and we cannot outrun them. We've gotta outsmart them. - Trick plays? - Just enough to keep them guessing. You see another way? You just can't use them too often, though. - They catch on, we toast. - We're toast if we don't put points on that board. We gotta make it through the fourth. And they got a deep bench. We're still in the game. Good job on the defense getting us on the board. I believe they thought this would be a shutout. We're gonna keep surprising them. You've figured out they've got power and speed, they're big but they're also predictable. We have gotta stay together. We can't outrun them, but we can outsmart them. With the Giants leading 14 to 7, we get set to bring you the second half of this championship game. And unless the Eagles find a way to solve Richland's size and strength the Giants could very well be taking home their fourth state title tonight. Make it work, Zach. The Eagles come out with a little trickery. And they're just about to tie this football game. Hustle, hustle. Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Make them pay, boys. Make them pay. Come on. That was dirty. He's hurt. He's hurt. He's hurt. Joshua Webster's being helped off the field with what we have been told is a broken collarbone. That came after a late hit by the Giants after the Eagles tied the game. - Stupid. That was dirty. - Calm down. This is a new ball game. Joshua's gonna be all right. David, come here. You gotta cover for Joshua now. - I need 110 percent. - All right, coach. Be the man. Kickoff team. Let's go. After a long drive, the Giants score. The Eagles prevent the conversion leaving this a 20 to 14 football game. Why are they on the scoreboard? They shouldn't even be in this game. For the rest of your life, you will remember today. I want you to remember you held nothing back, you did not lose heart you did not stop fighting, you did not quit. They're like little dogs nipping at your heels. Now get out there and stomp them. That's what I'm talking about. That's my defense. Let's go, Eagles. He's going for a bomb. Let's go. He's going for a bomb. Don't get beat. Go. The Eagles have shown the determination of a school twice their size. The Giants will now attempt a 35-yard field goal to extend their lead. That is the last time we go for a field goal. We should be in the end zone every stinking time. Double flex wall. Double flex wall. And hit. Go. Go. Go. What are you doing? Field-goal unit. Go. Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go. - Good job. All right. That's my team. Coach, I need a rest. I can't go much more. I need you on that field. You have gotta stay in the game. I need you. Yes, sir. David Childers is in to kick for Joshua Webster. We understand this is his first season. He's gone three for four this season. Looking at the stats, he's been limited to short-range kicks. Come on, David. You got this. Yeah. Timeout, ref. Ref, timeout. Coach, I'm done. Someone else has gotta lead. Brock, this is when it matters most. I know you're tired. It's easy to lead when you're strong. But now is when you lead us, right now. Can you give me four more downs? I just need four more downs. Four more. All right, come here. Come here. This is our time and you've got to put the nails in the coffin. Look at me. We didn't fight this far to give up in the last quarter. Leave everything on the field. And field goals, they're not an option. I need you for four more downs. Who's with me? Now get out there and get it done. With less than two minutes left, the Giants stand on the verge of their fourth-straight consecutive state title. A tired Eagles team lines up to face them yet again. Stone wall. Stone wall. Yes. Stone wall. - Stone wall. - Stone wall. Stone wall. Stone wall. The Giants line up first and goal. This score will solidify the championship. Hand the- - No, wait a minute. He is stopped. The Eagles are still in it, showing determination to fight this one out. Three more downs. - Three more. - Yeah. You gotta hang with me. I know it's getting tough. We gotta stop them here. It's second down and goal to go for the Giants. The state title is within their grasp. Both of the stands are on their feet as they get ready to run this play. Wes Porter will take it. No, the Eagles have stopped him again. That's my team. That's my team. Come on. Get it in the end zone. Two more. And here we go again. They're gonna try it again. Wes Porter will take the snap. He's looking to pass into the corner. But the Eagles bat down the pass. The crowd is going nuts right now. The Giants have been kept out of the end zone on three straight plays. Now Bobby Lee Duke will have a big decision to make. - We have gotta go for a field goal. - We are not going for a field goal. He's not kicking it. Brock. Brock. One more down. One more down. It's fourth down and the Giants are going for the touchdown. This crowd is going absolutely berserk right now. They line up at the one-yard line. Wes Porter's gonna take the snap. Brock Kelley's gonna meet him head-on. And there's a fumble. The Eagles have the football. They're taking it down the field. He's at the 40. He's at the 50. He's at the 40. He'll be run out at the 34-yard line. Are you believing this? With two seconds left, the Eagles have got a shot at this football game. - We've got time for a Hail Mary. - The defense is too strong. No, we can't run it. That's our only option. You gotta kick it, man. David. I need a 51 -yard field goal. - I can't kick that far. - They've stopped the pass all night. - You're my best option. - The furthest I've kicked is a 39. There is no way I can kick a 51 -yard field goal. I believe you can. Do the best you can. Leave the results to God. I need you on that field. Field-goal unit. Grant, we've gotta throw it. He can't kick it. It's too far. - No, it's not. - What are you doing? I'm preparing for rain. I don't understand, but with two seconds left the Eagles are putting the game in the hands of a 145-pound backup kicker. This is not a good move. He even has to kick into the wind. David. He's not ready. He don't think he can do it. I don't have any more timeouts. Call a timeout, Bobby Lee. - This kid can't kick that far. - Call that timeout. Call a timeout anyway and let's ice him. David, come here. You're telling yourself you're gonna miss. It's too far. Listen to me. Do you think God could help you make this kick? - Do you believe it, David? - Yeah, if he wants to. So do I. Give him your best and leave the rest up to him. Will you do that for me? Make this field goal or not, we're gonna praise him. But don't you walk off this field having done any less than your best. - Can I help you? - Don't touch me. I'm standing for my son. God, help me make this kick. Kick it now. Kick it now. Hit. The kick is up. It's on its way. It's long enough. It's high enough. Does it have the distance? It does. It's good. It's good. It's good. The Eagles have won the championship. Thank you, God. I can't believe what I've just seen. I cannot believe what I've just seen. A miracle has occurred here tonight. The Shiloh Eagles have defeated the Richland Giants 24 to 23 to take the state title for the first time in their history. It's incredible. It's absolutely unbelievable. You are a state champion. You are a state champion. All right. You guys, who's the state champions? Okay. Okay. I got something to say. David Childers. Don't you ever let anyone tell you that you're under par second-rate or inferior. I just watched God do a miracle through you. I saw a field of Giants, 85 of them to be exact, fall in defeat. Now you tell me what's impossible with God. Nothing, coach. Zach, I just watched you and the offense do what they said could not be done. Now you tell me what's impossible with God. Nothing, coach. Brock, how about it? You built that stone wall, didn't you? And it stood. Now you tell me what's impossible with God. Nothing, coach. - Scott, what's impossible with God? - Nothing. Are you sure? Those Giants are big. They outnumber us three to one. Are you sure there's nothing impossible with God? I'm sure, coach. - Nathan, what's impossible with God? - Nothing, coach. - Jonathan? - Nothing. - Are you positive? - Positive, coach. So am I. So am I. God can do whatever he wants to do, however he wants to do it. And he chooses to work in our lives because he loves us because he's good. Hope today's a milestone for what he can do for the rest of your life if you trust him. Why don't we spend some time thanking him? Well, look who just walked in this house. Couldn't be the state-champion coach Grant Taylor, could it? Because he's not supposed to live here. He's supposed to be out looking for a job. God did it, Brooke. He did it. He gave me this job provided for our needs took away my fear. He throws in the state championship just because he can. It's been one of the best days of my life. - The day's not over yet. - What do you mean? Grant Taylor, I just want you to know that you've made the team. What team? The daddy team. We're gonna have a baby? We're gonna have a baby. You tell me, Coach Taylor tell me what's impossible when God's on your side? Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm overwhelmed. - Miss... - Yeah? - Your bag... - Is it mine? (strong american accent) It's certainly yours! It flew out of the car window right when you... hit the tree. Are you OK? I'm a simple russian girl. Maybe I don't understand something. How could he even suggest anything like that? Did he really think I'd agree to do that with his dog? He must be sick! I must forget him. I love him! I will forget him! I am Anna Markova, Hello. promise that it's all over between us. My answer is "no", Misha. Never! And get your disgusting dog out of here! What fucking dog?

Situation... enemy forces. Razlan dragovich... former yugoslav army general wanted for crimes committed during the balkan civil war. Made a name for himself as an ethnic cleanser. Personally commanded pretty much the same design for a cannon... giant, cast-iron. Unfortunately, these cannons were incredibly heavy and cumbersome, and it took several men and several horses just to move them into position. Along came the king of Sweden, King Gustavus Adolphus ll, who had a brand-new idea for an army, an army that was incredibly mobile that could deploy quickly. He threw out this idea of a cannon and came up with something that was lighter and more portable. Now, in truth, there wasn't much leather in a Swedish leather cannon. In fact, it had a thin-walled copper tube for its barrel... It's your basic sawed-off leather cannon. ...with a brass plug on the end. That was covered with several layers of canvas soaked in mastic. What the heck is mastic? Well, it's a type of resin. Now, we don't have mastic, but what we do have is a two-part epo xy resin. On top of that were four iron bands to reinforce it. Then more canvas and mastic. They'd paint another layer. That way, it gets embedded. And when it hardens, it's gonna be very strong. And, finally, on the top, was leather. Now, it was called a leather cannon, but, in fact, it was a hybrid. It had a metal barrel. The important thing is that it was lightweight and mobile. Mobile, you say? Well, with these wheels, they can roll on down to the bomb range... Charge! Whoo-hoo! ...where we'll find out whether these mythical cannons, built to spec, could have really worked. Okay, here we go. One full-beer-bottle concussion test in 3, 2, 1. It looks great. Seems to work. Except it doesn't. A look at the high-speed Whoa! ... Wow! ...confirms the beer isn't clear. The problem is, the beer is obstructing our ability to see the brain. ...Yeah. ... Isn't that always the way? So the way to go is carbonated H20. We're ready. Let's do it. Full-beer-bottle concussion test... 3, 2, 1. Didn't break. ...High-speed. ... High-speed. Wow. That's a lot of force. You see how the skull moves and then the brain's in one place. ... Yeah. Hits the side of the skull on the front side. And then look at that... the brain's going completely to the opposite. Oh, wow. Look at the waves inside the jell-o. That's what happens in real life. The full-bottle hit clearly falls into the "not good" category. Another wasted beer. Cue the empty-bottle comparison. Somewhere, kittens are crying. What do you think is gonna happen, buddy? Really? No, I never saw it that way before. Okay. ...You ready for the empty bottle? ... Ready. All right, empty-bottle concussion test... 3, 2, 1. I don't even need to see the high-speed. I can tell by looking at the guy's face that he's messed up. Sure, he's not a pretty sight, but he's actually a lot better off than he was after the last test. The lateral movement of the skull is significantly reduced with the empty bottle. Boy, there's nowhere near the amount of head movement relative to brain. So, it is moving around, but not near as much as it was with the full bottle. Yeah. Yeah, you're delivering less force with an empty bottle, no question. ... Awesome. That's, like, a result. Let's put the two up next to each other on the screen just like that. Okay, now play. Look at that! It couldn't be clearer. The full bottle is far worse. That's another headache for this forensic-science inspired myth. So far, Adam and Jamie have yet to see a sign that an empty bottle, when smashed, can cause more damage. But they're not done yet. The additional mass in a full bottle does seem to impart more energy to a target skull when it's broken over it, and that can lead to a concussion, but we're talking about head injury here. And so that could also be skull fractures. It could be skin lacerations. So we're gonna have a close look at those, too. Buddy, remember that time I built the machine to swing bottles of beer at your head? No, you don't! Mmm. That's a delicious memory. Now what we're gonna do is test out the Swedish leather cannon, in which most of the metal of the barrel has been replaced by other materials to make it lighter. Whoo-hoo! Let's go to battle! Then we'll move on to the Irish leather cannon, which it's all leather. All right, folks, what I have here is 6 ounces of black powder. This is what we're gonna be using to propel our cannonball. Now, when we fired the parrot gun, it was traveling at 389 miles per hour. That is fast, the same amount of energy... it would be like hitting a baseball going 1,200 miles per hour. Folks, this is something you do not want to play with. So, with a firm grip on the explosive potential involved and all of the technical jargon... Okay, where's the pokey stick? ...the team lock and load. Venting! All right, loaded. Okay, gonna go hot. ...You ready? ... I'm ready. Fire in the hole! This is Swedish cannon in 3... 2, 1. ...Yeah! ... Yeah! Look at that! It worked! Or did it? Now, when we came out here, some of us thought that this was going to shoot off like a cannon, some of us thought it might explode. It pretty much did both. Holy crap! Look at this. It just completely blew out the back end. Well... One-shot wonder. We actually had the cannonball shoot out of one end while the end bits shot out the other. It's not looking too good. But a quick assessment of the targets, and the team are much more positive. Hey, it did the job, come on. Give it up for the Swedish cannon! It didn't make it through the sandbags, but it did make it through the second barrel. And once the numbers are crunched, it gets even more interesting. So, we tested our Swedish cannon with the same-size and -weight cannonball, the same amount of black powder. I'm getting 667 feet per second, which is over 450 miles an hour. That's 50 miles an hour faster than our parrot gun. ... What? ! And I've got to say... it's performance was equal to or a little bit better than the all-metal cannon. It had a muzzle velocity that was higher. Maybe it was a tighter pack, so, that way, it shot the ball faster... who knows? We only missed the "x" by that much. Minor problem... we blew out the breach. But bear in mind, this was our first attempt to make this type of cannon. I'm sure the Swedish didn't get it right the first time. So as far as a battlefield weapon, the Swedish cannon had superior maneuverability with very good accuracy. Unfortunately, longevity could be a problem. And as it turns out, historically, it was. So, in the context of the parrot-rifle performance benchmark, the lightweight hybrid cannon matched up, which just leaves the Irish question. The wheels came off. Good sign. So, we've got 6 ounces of black powder All right, ready to load? ... Black powder. ...a 3-pound cannonball... Ooh. That's nice and tight. ...and a barrel that's one inch thick of leather. You add all that up, I think you're gonna get "boom. " All right, everybody, clear muzzle from now on. This whole idea of building a cannon out of leather, it's absurd. Run away! Loaded! But, I mean, if you're desperate and that's the only material you have available to you, I guess, sure, why not try it? But, I mean, we know how powerful exploding black powder is. Come on, Irish leather cannon! All right, this is Irish leather cannon. Ready? The forces involved... I mean, is a one-inch wall of leather gonna be enough to contain it in order to launch this cannonball? Fire in the hole! I'm very curious to find out. My feeling is it's probably not gonna work. ...2, 1. Aah! Whoa! Nice! Aah! Aah! Look what happened! Look where the cannonball is. It's like two feet in front of it. Bink! It was more dangerous to be behind this cannon than in front of the cannon. Yep, it's pretty clear the Irish cannon failed on all counts. The back end blew out, and even with modern glue, the barrel untraveled, so the guys can't even try again. What we were looking for for this myth to be confirmed was very simple... lethality. Say the Irish were fighting leprechauns, it might be lethal. Look at how far the cannonball went. We tested the parrot rifle and the Swedish leather cannon. And with the same-size cannonball and the same amount of gunpowder, they were able to launch the ball at 350 to 450 miles per hour. Now, as far as the Irish leather cannon goes I can't call that lethal. ... No. ...with the best available information, built to those specifications, this one is busted. But that does not mean we're gonna end here. We are gonna see what it would take to build a working cannon out of nothing but leather. It might not be possible, but we're gonna try. But what about other types of head trauma? What about a skull fracture? To find out, Jamie... That's what I'm talking about. ...is taking a piece of pig skull... 7 millimeters. Same thickness as a human skull. ...to calibrate and manufacture a polyurethane plastic that fractures in exactly the same way as a human skull. Pulled from the pan while pliable, he forms it into shape before it hardens. We've got the base, and we've got this insert that goes over this cavity. And when we hit it with a beer bottle like so, if we get a fracture, we know that we would have fractured a real skull. To get a realistic mass, Jamie adds a brain's weight of ground beef. That's it. 6 pounds. Meanwhile, Adam has built a bar for the soon-to-break-out bar fight... Welcome to the "Mythbusters" Bar. Can I interest you in an empty beer? ...which means Meat Head, with his inability to duck, is about to get a headache. Mr. Hyneman says it's time to bash some heads in and chew some gum. And he's fresh out of gum. Take it away. Okay, skull-fracture rig in 3, 2, 1. All hell broke loose. We've got broken bottles, we've got broken head, and meat spilling out all over the place. Adam's no doctor, but "broken head" and "meat spilling out" is a fairly accurate diagnosis. Oh, man! That is... it's clearly shattered the skull. Totally shattered the skull. The rig worked. Yep, Meat Head did us proud, huh? All we need now is to try this with an empty bottle. Yep. More data! More data, with a side of sampling and a comparative-observation salad coming right up. Empty bottle of beer coming right up. Buddy, we're gonna do this at least one more time, and if it's any consolation, it's gonna hurt you a lot more than it's gonna hurt me. When you're ready. Empty bottle into skull-fracture rig. 3, 2, 1. Now, that's what I'm talking about. 1. Now you've broke it! That's why we can't have nice things! Nose fracture. No fracture on the skull. The whole purpose of this experiment is to figure out if it's worse to get a full bottle broken over your head or an empty bottle broken over your head. Personally, I want neither. But if I had to choose, especially when it comes to skull fractures, like this test here, the full bottle delivered more damaging skull-fracturing force than the empty bottle. But we're not done for, upon closer examination, Jamie and I note many lacerations in the skull of this meat head. And we wonder, perhaps in the area of lacerations, an empty bottle might be worse than a full bottle. We don't know, so we're gonna stretch some skin over one of these heads and start hitting that with broken bottles. Yeah! Down at the bomb range, the myth of the Irish all-leather cannon took a hiding. I just can't call that lethal. No. I mean, that's pathetic. But our team of tanners aren't done yet. They've set themselves the challenge of building an effective, viable cannon from nothing but cowhide. You have to massage the leather. Makes a better cannon. Actually, what makes a better leather cannon is attention to detail. And this time around, the team is going all out to iron out the issues from its last outing. All right, so, one thing we figured out the other day when we fired off our pure-leather cannon... when the ball came out, it actually delaminated the inside of the cannon. So what I'm doing right now is scraping up this leather enough so that the glue will bite down on this leather, and it'll stay together when we fire off the next cannon. So, just like everything else on this cannon, we're beefing it up, so to speak. This is our super breach plug. Made out of 42 layers of leather. This is gonna get rolled into the cannon. Charge goes here. Cannonball goes here. When we set it off, hopefully it goes like "ba-boom," and that like "ba-boing. " Now I'm working on the breach section. And what I have done is take the same cowhide, cut it down to 2-inch-wide strips. I'm putting on the contact cement on both sides, and then I'm laying those strips lengthwise around the back end of the cannon. This is gonna strengthen up our breach area. So, that way, it is strong enough to withstand the explosion of black powder in order to get our cannonball to launch. With the back end sufficiently built up, glued, and beaten into submission, the team is optimistic about their chances of success. This is the blast chamber, and we're talking about a 12-inch diameter. Not only that, but the breach has been reinforced with so many straps that we have about that much holding up the back end. I think there might be a possibility that we've made ourselves a working leather cannon. Now, I have a few finishing touches... Just to, you know, give it a little bit of beauty. So, under a veil of secrecy, our material girl applies her fashionable finishing touches. Then it's back down to the bomb range... drumroll, please for the big reveal. I was getting bored with the plain, old leather cannon, since we did so many. I thought, why not jazz it up a little but? It's a designer cannon! Wow. That's crazy. That is funny. You just pimped this cannon out. It looks the business, but can it pack the punch... a 6-ounce black-powder punch? When we ignite this, it's gonna expand to three 55-gallon drums of gas. That's a lot of energy, and that is what's gonna fire our ball out of our cannon. Or blow our cannon up. Either way, it's gonna be cool. If I'm gonna be testing what happens to someone's scalp when they're hit over the head with a bottle, I need a suitable scalp analogue. And to find it, "Dr. Franken-Hyn-Eman" figures out some scalp attributes he wants to emulate. That's moving about the same as the skin over my skull. Poked through at 2.43 pounds. This is very sort of fibrous. Next, he finds the artificial materials with those physical attributes. A vinyl epidermis absorbent subcutaneous layer and of course blood... lots of blood. Oh, no. I have blood everywhere. It all comes together in a disturbingly accurate analogue of human skin. The epidermis goes on it like so. And when I cut it, with any luck, it's gonna bleed. And with that... There you go. ...our fake-skinned Meat Head is ready to take one for the team. Let the lacerations begin. Laceration test with a full beer bottle. 3, 2... God, that is nasty! ...1! Uh-oh! Oh, there's definitely some cuts there. Yep. Oh, it bleeds. Nasty. Nasty. And if it was needed, a further graphic illustration of how dangerous it is to use a bottle as a weapon. Just put that there, and we'll put the other one there. And we know that that's our full bottle, and we'll compare it to the empty one. ... Okay. Okay, here we go. Laceration test... empty beer bottle into our meat buster. 3, 2, 1. A successful smash. And, as with the full bottle, it's immediately obvious damage was done. I like my fake skin. It's nice fake skin. And an up-close comparison sees very little difference in the damage to that skin between the two tests. I don't know about you, but I look at these, and they look pretty much equivalent to me. You know, give or take a nick or two, it's the same. Yeah. The original myth is that having an empty bottle broken over your head is worse for you than having a full bottle broken over your head. Well, from our testing, from the standpoint of your brains, it's not true. You'll get a much worse concussion from a full bottle than an empty one. And also from our testing, on bones, the full bottle is also worse. It's much more likely to cause a skull fracture than an empty bottle. Now, with the skin-laceration test, actually, for the first time, they're about even. But that still doesn't make the statement that the empty bottle is worse supportable. So it's still not looking very good. In fact, I'd almost say it's busted. O- kay, the myth that it's worse to have an empty bottle broken over your head than a full bottle. Let's recap where we stand from the standpoint of your brains. ... It's busted. From the standpoint of your skullbone. Also busted. From the standpoint of your skin. No difference. ...Well, you know where that leaves this myth. ... Busted. Totally busted. Kari, Grant, and Tory are about to find out if leather can be a lethal cannon. This is our target... we have a barrier of milk backed by a triangulation of three water barrels. Why milk? Well, because it's gonna look really cool on high-speed when our cannonball crashes into it. And speaking of high-speed, with the aid of the high-speed and this scale here, we're going to be able to catch the velocity of the ball and see if it matches our parrot gun. And finally, here we have our designer-inspired ultimate, completely reinforced, 100%- genuine leather cannon. If only the Irish had something this stylish at the siege of Ballygally Castle, well, who knows if the cannon would've exploded? But at least they'd be fighting in style. However, it's not style, but performance substance that ultimately matters. Remember, the benchmark we're using is the parrot rifle's muzzle velocity of 389 miles per hour. Plus, it has to be capable of multiple, successful firings. Oh, man, this is the prettiest cannon I ever seen. Kari has disguised our cannon as a purse. All it needs now is Jamie's favorite slippery solution. I saw this on "Dirty Jobs" once. ...Really? ... Yeah. Except for it was a cow, wasn't it? ...Yeah, whatever. ... Don't worry, Betsy. So, why are we lubing up the barrel? Well, the last time we tried the Irish leather cannon, built to historical specifications, the cannonball had a difficult time getting out of the barrel, and it delaminated the innermost layer. We don't want that to happen this time. So we're adding lube, and hopefully, it'll come shooting right out the end. ...You in? Yep. ...That's it. ... Okay. Let's do it. I think we have a very good chance... 80% at least. The other 20% is "it explodes. " So, it's time to find out if the bling leather cannon... Can. Here we go. Designer-inspired cannon. 3, 2, 1. Whoo! It worked! 100% leather! We should fire that again! ...And it didn't blow up! ... Whoo! We did it! We made a leather cannon! Yeah! The reaction says it all. We made a leather cannon, and it worked! From back behind the blast shields, the test looks to be a success, but up close, the evidence begins to contradict their initial reaction. Punched through the carton, no problem. ...Here. ... Hey! Unlike the parrot rifle, which easily punched through two water barrels, the leather cannon only just pierced the milk carton. You're definitely gonna give somebody a bruise with that. A lethality assessment that's backed up by the numbers from the high-speed. ...So, I've got 52.5 miles per hour. ... Wow. You could drive faster than that cannonball came out of the cannon. Yeah, but, look, it was entirely made out of leather. ...I think that's awesome. ... That is awesome. The less-than-lethal muzzle velocity was caused by what is the final nail in the leather-cannon coffin... the delamination of the barrel and deformation of the combustion chamber. And that can only mean one thing. It looked like it was gonna be plausible for a second there, but if you can only get one shot out of it, I think this one's busted. Busted. But, man! What a way to go out! That's looking cool. At least we got one good shot out of it. Leather... it's good for fashion, not good for artillery. We're here! The immigrants have arrived! Oh, darn it! I wanted to have everything put away by the time you got here. Oh, come on, mom. We're only here for three days. We're not waiting out the apocalypse. But I've got cooper's cereal... Ah! Look. Orange juice for paige. You brought your own food? w - What's the matter with mine? The painter said with all the sanding, there's gonna be too much dust. I didn't want to waste it. You know what, sarah? It's such a good idea. Luc is moving in, so you're giving the whole pla a brand-new coat of paint for a fresh new start. Yeah, I hope it's not too fresh. You know, it's a big adjustment for everyone. Cooper's going a little... Crazy. Mom, can I play my video game? ! Yes, I have become that mom that uses video games as a babysitting device. Trust me, it's better for all of us. Shh. Grandma, can I set this up in the living room? Yes, after you give me my hug. Where's my hug? Okay! Hug! Hug! Hug! Come on. Hugs. Oh! Ohh! Mmm! Thank you. Oh, where's paige? Oh, she's doing a girl scout camping weekend. No internet, no cell phones. Luc's convinced she's gonna come home a whole hey. oh, luc, congratulations. You've got your own set of keys and everything. Yeah. mm. I am a pasadenian now. A pasadenian? You are a pasadenian, that's for sure. Sarah? Mm-hmm. Narrow lake... What's going on? Oh... Mom, look! I'm drilling for buried treasure. Uh, cooper's become obsessed with the drilling we're doing up there. Maybe he'll become a geologist. Oh, have they found anything yet? Cooper. No, they haven't, but I hope they find something soon because the hole they're digging isn't just in the ground. We are hemorrhaging cash. We just need to have a little faith. I - I'm certain there's something of value there. I'm just certain of it. Well, I hope you're right, mom, 'cause we're betting the company on it. Cooper. Cooper, your mom and your grandma are trying to have a conversation. Stop it. What? I can't understand your accent. Cooper! Excuse me. That is very rude. Oh, you know what? I'm just gonna unpack your stuff just over here out of the way. That's it? Well, I told him it was rude. He's 8 years old. What else do you want me to say to him? Talk to him. Okay, cooper, time-out. Because he said so? No, because i said so. That chair, five minutes. Right now. Mom, i am too old for time-outs. I don't care. You know, sarah, he really is right. After about 5 or 6, there needs to be some consequences. Okay, everybody take time-out. Oh. It's the drilling company. Excuse me. Hello? Yes. Thanks for calling me back. Grandma, when's lunch? Cooper, time-out. Okay. Yep, do it. Thank you. What did they say? What they always say, mom. They need more money to dig deeper. They'll call me if they find anything. Ojal's gonna have to sell some more land to pay for this. I'm hungry. What do you want... Peanut butter and jelly, string cheese and grapes? Sarah, what happened to the time-out? Well I thought nobody liked time-out anymore. Is there any mac and cheese? He's hungry. That's probably why he's going so crazy. Honestly, what do you want me to do, starve him? No, but at least five minutes of time-out. That's what it's all about. I mean, I can take him upstairs. He's been like that for a week now. A week? We had an incident at school... A small thing... Jamie barton, her ponytail and a stapler. Let me take him upstairs. If he's hungry, honestly, there's no point. Okay, let me take the bags upstairs. Thank you. Does this mean my time-out's over? Shh! Yes. Go. Get out of here. Scram. Cha-ching! Stay out of trouble. Ahh. Okay. Is everything okay with the two of you? He's an 8-year-old boy, mom. You've been there. No. Luc. Between you and luc. Oh! Yeah. No, we're fine. I'm gonna make this work, mom. I just wish people could be more... Patient. Transitions are hard. Look, we could maybe start with crepes. Mm. Have you ever been to one of those crepe places? No, never been, but I have thought about it. Well, I want people to do more than just consider eating at our restaurant. How serious are you guys about this? Ask him. He's the one with the money. Well, I've often thought about opening a restaurant, and this would be a perfect time. What about a wine bar? You know, with... With the big taps. Well, we... We talked about that. It requires a liquor license. That takes forever. Okay, fine. Don't sell booze. Don't expect our family to show up. Excuse me. The point of this is not to feed our family. The point is to make some money. Well, when you need a lawyer to draw up your contracts, give me a call. Sure. Maybe. Maybe? I was a corporate litigator for ten years. I think I can draw up a property contract. Of course you can. I just meant that hopefully you'll be busy doing something else by then. I'm busy doing something else today. Sarah, who actually wants my help, has asked me to look over the ojai drilling contracts. So good luck with your restaurant. I have work to do. Kevin, don't be upset. I'm not upset. I'm just busy. The contract to train the somali police... Bill stanton wants it awarded to his company. Yeah, of course he does. It's a massive, open-ended commitment. And obviously, he needs your committee to appropriate the funds. And I wanna catch him cheating. National security shouldn't make you rich. I understand. So I should wait for his call? Actually, there's a benefit at his club tomorrow... A tennis tournament. Excuse me. Oh, it's my wife. All right, what'd you forget? Okay, I'm meeting with jim hix. You said something about education cuts. Was that a "don't forget to bring it up" or "steer clear"? Well, that depends on whether he's with carolyn or not. Carolyn? Carolyn? Carolyn! Carolyn! Right, his wife! Uh, y-yeah. Superintendent of humboldt county schools carolyn. Right. Thank you. I'm so glad I called you. Was evan awake? No, he's still asleep. Aw. All right, well, make sure you send me a lot of pictures, okay? Okay. And listen, you concentrate on getting those endorsements 'cause they could really turn this campaign around, right? Yeah, right. From your lips... Oh, robert, I love you. Love you. Sorry. She after an endorsement from hix? Yeah. She's gunning for mccarty, too. She's on her way to sacramento now. She's worked really hard for this, and... That's the issue for me, is if I get on the wrong side of stanton, her campaign will be the first casualty. They will come after her hard. My hat is off to kitty. It's a damn fine virgin run. But she's not getting those endorsements. The far right is going to determine the primary, and they don't like her. All due respect, don't worry about harming your wife's campaign. It'll be over this time next month. Joe, I've known you a long time, but let me tell you something. Never bet against my wife. hey. Uh, why do you look like kitty at one of her fund-raisers? Is it that bad? Pearls? Well, the bungalow that I love is having an open house. And apparently, the selling agent takes you more seriously if you look professional, so... I heard they also take you seriously if you actually have the money to pay for the house. Ha ha. Very funny. I'm just going to check it out. You want to come? Uh, no, because I am actually trying to make lasagna. Wait. You're cooking? Yeah. Jake's wife jessica is a vegetarian. I figured I'd make something and... And bring it on over. Is this them? Yeah, yeah. She asked me if I had any pictures to bring over. Hey, maybe you could, um, you could grab something at that organic place on main street. They have really good food. You know, her husband was just killed by an i.e.d. I think I should probably cook something. You're right. Maybe soup? Soup's a lot easier, and it's comforting. Yeah, maybe soup. Justin, are you okay? Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. 'cause ever since the funeral... No, no, I really am. I just, uh, you know, want to do something nice and... And help her out. That's nice. You want some company? Um, no, no. You go check out your house. It would be our house. Right. Our house. bye. What are you doing here? This is what unemployed losers do. They hang out in their mother's kitchens making sandwiches. You want a turkey and swiss? There's, like, 4 pounds of meat in here. I know. Don't ask. Make two or three. Okay. So how's the big move in going? Oh, you know... It's going. Did you get a chance to look over those contracts? Yeah, it's all pretty standard. The longer they keep drilling, the more you have to pay. Well, according to the local well records for the surrounding area, there's gotta be at lea water there. Okay, so all you can do now is wait. Which I'm really bad at. Well, where is luc? He usually manages to distract me. Actually, we're fighting. Oh, stop. He's too beautiful for that. Nobody's too beautiful for that. Oh, wow. You really do need help. You know what goes well with waiting? Turkey? Wine! Are you guys always here? I know. It's sad. Hey, evan. Come give me a kiss, buddy. Careful. He might eat you. Mwah. He's got the appetite of a football player. He's grown. Hey, beautiful. Do you want a glass? No. I'm gonna wait till the sun goes down. And besides, I gotta play tennis. Tennis? You know, I got roped into playing this doubles tournament. So I figured i'd go and hit with the pro. Why don't you ask this pro standing right here? You mean drinking right there. I was awesome back in the day. We were awesome. huh. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Kevrah. Got him. Then what happened? Uh, well, there was so much smoke and sand, I couldn't see, but I felt this guy grab my leg, so I reached down and picked him up and guess what. It was my buddy brian. That's unbelievable. Yeah, it was pretty cool. Look out! Oh, go left, go left, go left! Left, left, left. Left, left, left. Left, left, left, left, left. Oh, get him right there. What are you doing? ! Grandma. We're just playing. You have been playing for hours. It's a beautiful day outside. Why don't you go outside and play? Just let me kill a couple more invaders. Get him, get him. He's right there. Right there. Right there. Justin, darling, I love you. But why are you here? I need to make soup for a friend, and I was wondering if you could help me. What, like chicken soup? You know a hundred doctors. You're in med school. Have 'em write a prescription. I have my hands full today. She's not sick, mom. It's jake's widow... The guy who died in afghanistan. Oh. Got him. Got him. Got him? You got him. Head shot. Head shot. Ooh! Okay, cooper, time's up. Time's up. Here. You can take this. Go outside. Shoot some hoops. Look at all the stuff I drug out of the garage. Yeah, and stay in the yard and don't go near the pool. Miss you, buddy. Okay, come on. Let's go make some soup. All right. Just let me kill this one more bad guy. I'll be there in two minutes. Love you, ma. I can't bring stragglers, you guys. It's a private club. What club? Altadena tennis club. Card-carrying members. Since 1982. Yeah. hey. What, are you two drinking? It's not even noon. We're being european. Yeah. You're being something. Don't worry. We're leaving. We have to practice for a tennis tournament. Now... Now wait a minute. Just hold on. Tell him how great we were as doubles. They were good. They were very, very good. Of course, they almost got thrown out of the club. She only slapped him. Mom, it was a bad call, and you know it. Yeah. Oh, kevin. I can't. Why not? I've got cooper for the weekend. Well, when is the tournament? Well, it's, uh, tomorrow. Today is just practice. Well, that's perfect. I can take care of cooper today, and tomorrow, he's got a play date. No, but, mom, I was gonna take him to the play date and stay with him. He's 8 years old. I think one mom is enough. I don't know about that. Sarah, think about this. It would be fabulous. It would be robert and kevin against you and luc. No. I mean, the whole point is that kevrah was great together. Yeah. We don't even know if luc can play. Probably not. Well, now's yourururnce to find out. It would be wonderful for the two of you to have some adult time, honey. So it's done. Take them away. Yes. Can I make a deal with you? Yeah. Will you watch him till the nanny gets here? Absolutely. Good, good, good. And then I get to play with kevrah. kevrah. Well, and luc. Yeah. And luc. It's perfect, isn't it? mm. It looks amazing. I think you should do it. What? You mean, like... Like, put an offer in? You have the money. Pull it from ojai and transfer it into your personal account and make an offer. Mom, the agent already got two offers. They always say that. That's a sales technique. I saw a couple take out their checkbook. Well, then transfer the money and take out yours. It's just an offer. You're not obligated to spend a dime. So what, just pick up the phone and make a couple of calls? Yeah. That's all you have to do. If you really love this house... Then make it happen. She's looking at a house? That's very exciting. Yeah. Well, she's just looking, so it's not really a big deal. It's a really big deal. It would be your first house. Ma, we're not buying anything, so maybe we should just make the soup. Okay, you've chopped that enough. Put a big handful in the cheesecloth, and then tie it up with this string. Put it in the soup. It's an herb bouquet. And we can take it out before we give it to her. Right. Why do you have your dog tags on? Because I found 'em by my uniform when I was, uh, getting dressed for the funeral. Jake. Why did he go back, justin? It breaks my heart that he was there. Well, somebody has to be. Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I know this hit you hard. Have you been going to your meetings? Yes, mom, I've been going to my n.a. Meetings. I'm... I'm fine, really. Then maybe you could take your dog tags off. Okay. This is all done. So I'll just drop it in the soup? Yeah. Cooper, you know the rules. No swimming without a grown-up. Mom, I know how to swim. I just wanted to do a cannonball. Listen, if you had hit your head and no one was there, you would've drowned. And don't even get me started about the whole clothes thing. oh. hey. Were you with him? Yeah, I went to get him a towel. Luc, you said that you would keep an eye on him while I got changed. Well, I was, but he wanted to go swimming, so I went to pick up his bathing suit and told him to wait by the pool. Pfft. You took too long. What? Cooper, seriously? You told me you would wait. How am I supposed to trust you if you do things like that? What were you doing outside anyway? You said that you would stay here, play video games and stay out of trouble. Cooper, my goodness. You're soaking wet. What, did you fall in the pool? No, mom. He decided to go for a swim, alone, with his clothes on. You're the one who told me to go outside. I told you to go out and shoot some baskets rather than sitting here and shooting monsters all day. They're aliens. Okay, that is enough from you. Go get changed. I will deal with you later. Off you go. Look, mom, I told you... I know, sarah. I know. You told me you like to use these games as some kind of babysitter, but, honey, the one he's playing is the most violent game I have ever seen. That is ridiculous. He's shooting blue blobs. You never minded when tommy was playing with "duck hunt." "duck hunt"? Besides, it's a lot safer than swimming in that pool alone. I didn't expect him to jump in the pool fully clothed. Yeah, no one did. Sarah, I have to tell you, I think this game is a problem. All of these games are a problem. Oh, mom, stop. You told me yourself, he stapled some girl's ponytail? He's a boy. He's a little aggressive. He needs an outlet. Boys will be boys, is that it? Could you back me up here? I'm sorry, sarah. I think your mom is right. Stop making excuses. Video games or not, cooper has been acting out. Cooper is going through a bit of a rough patch right now. I am doing the very best I can, and I think the last thing that cooper needs is more cooks in the kitchen. Well, you asked for my opinion. I told you. Yeah, you did. If you two are finished ganging up on me, i'm gonna go talk to my boy. look at us... A couple of men of leisure hitting some tennis balls on a saturday afternoon. That's us. Feels weird to me, you know... Scheduling my day around court times and martini lunches, nowhere to report? Does it feel weird to you? No, but that's probably 'cause I still have my job as a united states senator. Go on. Get up there. I'm serving. All right, these go. oh! yes! Sarah, that was on my side. I didn't think you had it. I know how to play tennis. It's gonna be a long day. Let's go, kev. Buck up. Here we go. I know technically, you're still working. But what's next? I mean, you don't have anything lined up? Don't worry. I'll think of something. You're the most ambitious person I'll ever know. That's why I can't figure out why you're so cool playing tennis on a saturday afternoon. Well, we all have to enjoy our lives. Love-15. Bring it on. ¶ right down to the bone ¶ yeah! Nice try, babe. Don't patronize me. You know what? Maybe you're right. I mean, why am I so high strung? If you can handle the easy life, i'm sure I could. I just need to learn how to chill. Right? You need to learn how to play that net. Okay. 15 all. ¶ you might get away with it ¶ ¶ it's a risk, it's a risk, yeah ¶ ¶ too big for my heart ¶ oh! That's my partner! Nice shot, kev. Thanks, rah. That's what I'm talking about. You know what? That did feel good. I should play more tennis. Here we go. All right, kev. Let's do it. All right. ¶ a loss of the senses ¶ ouch. I had it. It was my ball. Why don't you play singles? ¶ they ride in your suit ¶ aha! A point. Don't get cocky. Nice shot. ¶ don't think, don't think ¶ ¶ don't talk, don't think ¶ just out. What? No, no, no, no, no. There is no way that was out. Well, it was too close for me to call. I think it was out. Yeah, well, of course you do. What is that supposed to mean? Luc, come on. You question my tennis game, my parenting. Maybe you and my mother should play together, because it feels like you two are in agreement about a lot of things lately. Sarah, I think it was out. That's all I'm saying. You know what? Let me play forehand. Hey, you know, I have an idea. You guys have such a great history on the court. Why don't you guys play together? And, luc, you come over here for a minute. Fine by me. Works for me. A thousand thank yous. You kidding me? Been there. And there's my move, so it's your turn. aha. Which move will it be? There. You see? You really have to think about this game. You have to strategize. You have to suss out your opponent. There! I took you. I like "galactic showdown" better. You fly space ships and shoot bad guys, just like uncle justin did in the war. It was so cool. He saved his friend by dragging him through the desert. And then there were real-life helicopters. He got to jump out of one once. It was so cool. Yes, I know. He was very brave. Okay. There, it's your move. King me, grammy! I'm not going to king you. You have to earn that. Don't you think? mmm. These biscotti are amazing. I feel like I'm sitting on a piazza in florence. God, I'm good. oh. mmm. Hello, boys. Ooh, working on our menu? Kevin... You have to taste these biscotti. They're fantastic. I can't. I'm in training. I thought you were working on contracts. Where have you been, wimbledon? Maybe next year. I whizzed through my contracts, and then I tripped the light fantastic at the altadena country club. You're kidding. They let you back in after the incident? Oh! That was one stupid harassment suit from a disgruntled tennis pro. Oh, and guess what. What? Kevrah lives. Kevrah? Don't ask. You should've seen us on the court today, uncle saul. Like riding a bicycle. I was venus to sarah's serena. Were venus and serena drinking? 'cause you seem very relaxed all of a sudden. Mm. Actually, I did have a glass of wine with lunch. You know what I've realized? I've worked since I was 15. That's 23 years without a break. And for what? Money. Yeah, and I'll work again, but right now, no one's exactly beating down the door to hire me. So you know what? This might be a blessing in disguise. No one actually needs my help, not even you guys. Oh, kevin, stop it. If you want to get involved in the restaurant, you can. I just assumed that you... No, no, no. That's your passion. Now I have my own passion. Really? And what might that be? Tennis. So if you'd excuse me, i'm gonna go and soak because I need to be nice and loose and limber for my big game tomorrow. Kevrah for match point. Walker serves. Aces. Crowd goes wild. Who knew unemployment could be so much fun? hey. Hey. How did it go? Uh, okay. Okay. Good call on the, uh, soup. She, uh, she really liked it. Oh, good. I'm glad. ohh. So... Justin... Yeah. The house was amazing. I mean, absolutely amazing. A huge backyard, a swing on the front porch, built-ins in every room... It was perfect. Cool. I'd really like for you to come see it with me tonight. Uh, rebecca, listen, I was kinda hoping we could just chill and watch a movie. Okay, well, the thing is... I know I was supposed to be window-shopping, that the money should be back in my account by monday, and there were other buyers that were interested, so... I put an offer in. Wait. You made an offer? We don't have to pay them anything. Whoa. Time-out. Time... Rebecca, you made an offer on a house that I haven't even set foot in yet? No, I know. And, justin, obviously, if you don't like it, we're not... We're not gonna buy it. I just want you to come and see it with me. It's perfect and... This is crazy to me, rebecca. Well, I don't understand. What is so crazy about us wanting to buy a house together? I mean, I don't even know where this is coming from. You know what? Fine. You don't get it. Then it explain it to me, because, justin, this morning, you said that you were fine and you seemed to be dealing with this. So obviously, this is hitting you a lot harder than you're willing to admit. Okay, what do you want from me? All right? My friends are dying. I'm having trouble thinking about houses and blenders. All right? Justin, calm down. And the degree I'm gonna get in seven years. Calm down. I'm sorry. I know that jake was your friend, but think about it. The last thing he would want you to do is stop living your life, and if you're trying to shame me into not wanting a comfortable future with you, then... Then you're right, I don't understand. All right. Fine. I-I have nothing else to tell you. all right, let's stretch it out. I got you. Really feel it. There you go. Okay, when I say "we are," you say "champions." We are... Champions. We are... Champions. We are... Champions. You in this, sis? yep. You have to say it. Oh, yeah, sorry. To win it, bro. All right. What's up? Cooper's play date canceled. Mom's bringing him to watch the game. There is no way he's gonna sit still that long. Sarah, she raised five of us. Yeah, but we didn't have to deal with a strange frenchman moving into our house. There was that one exchange student. Look, she's, like, the child whisperer, okay? Let her focus on cooper. You focus on the match. We'll be fine. Okay. Okay? Go, team kevrah. Where are those guys? I don't know. You think we scared them off yesterday? Robert? Doubtful. Senator. Bill stanton. Good to meet you. It's a beautiful day for a good cause, wouldn't you say? Yeah, I'm... Just happy to be here to help out. Yeah, you know, I was sorry to hear you're not running for reelection. Ah. You got a line on what's next? That's sort of the $1-million question. Well, don't tell me it's golf. That'd be a prime waste of national resources. Well, now, now. You should wait until you see my short game before you say that. Well, maybe we should play sometime. Maybe we should. It's a nice club you have here. You're not a member, are you? No, no. I'm surprised they let me in at all. I think I've passed bills with less paperwork. Yeah. Well, sorry about that. Bureaucracy, right? Indeed. Well, next time, call me up. I'll walk you straight in. Or I could join. I'd be glad to sponsor you. Here. Try my cell if you're interested. Thank you. Pleasure, senator. I don't want to watch tennis. Why couldn't I have just stayed home with evan and his nanny? It's gonna be fun. Hold on. Hold on. I want to put more block on your nose. Here. Mom. You already lathered him up in the car. It's hot out. I missed his nose, justin. All right, never mind. Just wear this. How's that? no. You know, I wore a hat every day in iraq. You did? Mm-hmm. Everybody did. That's awesome. Did you also tell him you ended up in a hospital in germany? All right. Call it. No need. You can serve. Okay. So they have a great bar here. What do you want me to do? I ran into him. When it comes to bill stanton? Be rude and ignore him. He's the host. It's his charity event. Right. So write a check. Don't schmooze with the prince of darkness, okay? I mean, what did he want, help on votes for a contract? We were talking about golf. I just hope no one got a picture, 'cause that would be bad publicity. I thought you didn't work for me anymore. For kitty, I mean. But you're right. I don't work at all. So let's play tennis. Mccallisterandlaurenttoserve, first set. ah. Ooh. Nice serve. 15-love. Where the hell did that come from? Lucky shot. That wasn't a lucky shot. That was an ace. Hey. Sorry rebecca couldn't come today. Yeah. Is she busy? Uh, yeah, yeah, she was. Hey, coop, while you're in there, you want to grab me a granola bar, buddy? Okay. Out. 15 all. yes. Grandma? Yeah. Why do you have an umbrella? Shh. It's, um, it's not for the rain. It's for the sun. It's like your hat, only bigger, way bigger. Cooper, stop it. I'm just shooting luc. 15-30. Justin, would you grab that from him? You're the one who started it. What did I do? You think he got the idea to turn that into a gun all by himself? Uh, yes, mom. He's a boy. You take away the umbrella, he'll use a stick. You take away the stick, he'll use his hand. I had nothing to do with it. I'm gonna get a soda. Would you like anything? No, thank you. You should really knock that off. Cooper, stop it. 30 all. Hi, honey. How did you miss that? Sorry, I got distracted. Kevrah was undefeated in 17 years, okay? I'd like to keep it that way. oh. Nice shot. 40-30. Cooper, stop it. Cooper. Cooper. Cooper, what are you doing? Cooper. I'll handle this. He's throwing balls at the court. This is not cool. Listen, you talking to him now is only gonna make things worse. They're not gonna get any better if you keep butting in. What? He's my son. Yes, he is. And where do i fit in? Look, I don't know, but he already has a father, who, by the way, is not exactly thrilled about you, and obviously, neither is cooper. I'm stuck in the middle. I'm trying to figure it out. Well, you let me know when you do. Till then, we're not gonna be able to play as a team. Coop. Cooper. My... Sorry. It was an accident. Okay... Listen to me, that was no accident. The corkscrew, the swimming pool, this... None of it was an accident, was it, cooper? Hmm? Okay, you're coming home with me. Oh, I... Mom, this is my job, not yours. Sorry, kevin. We gotta forfeit. What? Get outta here. ow! hey. hey. Come on. We're leaving. What, already? Who... Who won the match? No one. It was a forfeit. Come on. Well, where is cooper? He's with sarah, so let's go. What, you know what? Time-out. What... What's the deal? Are you mad at me or something? No, I'm not mad at you. I'm onto you, justin. Wh... You're on... The funeral, the dog tags, all these war stories to cooper... I know where this is headed. Don't put words in my mouth. You want to go back to this hideous war. I don't want to go back, mom. I just want to... Don't lie to me, justin. I've been through this before. You went there twice. The last time almost killed you. Why would you go back? Your life is great. You're in med school. You have a wife who loves you. Yeah, and I love her, too, mom, and there's noth... You made a commitment to stay with her. You can't walk away from your life, justin. You can't. mm. that feels good. Wow. Andy roddick passed out on my couch. Roger federer's a better player. Yeah, but roddick is cuter. Oh, I'm flattered. But we both lost the big game. Well, I bet you played hard and gave it your all. Why are you being so nice to me? Maybe I feel guilty. I haven't exactly been paying attention to you lately. That's all right. I'm not a child. Although I have been behaving like one recently. We're having a baby in seven months. I need to get a job, any job. It's not about the job. Okay, I need to make money. It's not really about the money either. You need a purpose. And it's not tennis. Can we just leave all the purpose to you, just for a moment? I really want you to open this restaurant. Maybe that's my purpose, encouraging you. Do you know what I miss? What? The old kevin walker... Who ran towards his purpose. So why am I running away from it now? Because you don't know what it is and you hate uncertainty. At least i'm certain of you. Now I know we talked about luc moving in, and you were excited about the idea of it. But now there's a whole new member of the family, and we think you might be finding it a bit challenging. hmm? It's different than what I expected. I get that. You know, for me, too. But he's here now, so it's time that we all learn... How we're gonna get along. Now I love luc, okay? So when you hurt his feelings, you hurt my feelings, the same way that I'd be hurt if somebody hurt you. You know what I'm talking about? yes. Good. So do you have something you might want to say to luc? I'm sorry, luc. Thank you, cooper. Okay, now you go brush your teeth, start a chapter, and I'll be in to tuck you in, okay? I love you. Mwah. Nicely done. Thank you. I wonder if he's upset that he's not the man of the house anymore. You know, he used to... Come and cuddle and fall asleep and... He always had me all to himself. Speaking of cuddling... You know, I don't think cooper is the only problem here. I think you need to deal with your own issues. You're right. I'm so sorry. Okay, here's the deal... What if the only reason we've been deliriously happy is because we've been living in a fantasy? And now it's... Real. Yeah. Real is good, right? Real is real. It's paint colors and temper tantrums and... And the emotional lives of 8 year olds. I don't want to mess this up, luc. For me, this is... This is a huge deal. And it's a huge deal for me, too. I want to be a family with you. But you think cooper's tough? Try living with a 13-year-old girl who hates you. You're so relaxed about it. I don't think you really have thought through the stress that children put on a relationship. What if it's just too hard? Now I can deal with you breaking my heart. But I can't deal with you breaking theirs. I'm not gonna break anyone's heart. But we don't know that, do we? I love you, sarah. And I'm not trying to be their father or anything. No, I know. But do you know who you do want to b your partner, a very positive role model for the kids. And for that, i'm gonna need to have my own relationship with them. Then we are very, very, very lucky. Hello. hi. What have you got there? Oh, I just wanted to thank you for taking care of evan for so long. Oh, don't be silly. I'm his grandmother. I love it. Oh, I know. That's why it's not cash. Oh. Well, thank you. Sure. So, um... He's asleep in the living room right now in his playpen thingy. The nanny left right after we got back from the game. I'm just packing up all of his stuff right now. Okay. Robert, can I ask you something? Sure. Did justin talk to you about wanting to go back to afghanistan? Oh, god. He did. Look, nora... Oh, please tell me you didn't say anything to encourage him. No, I just listened. To what? Nora, the first time you enlist, it can be about a bunch of things. But if you reenlist, it's personal. It's about wanting to get back to people who you love and who understand you in a way that nobody else possibly can. Oh, that's easy for you to say. You're not going back to war. Well, we all go to war in different ways. But I don't want my son to go back to this war ever again. I understand. But that pull is awfully strong. And that's your son. Maybe you want to go take care of him. Oh, hey. Oh, my gosh. You would not believe the traffic out there. The 101 is... Is bumper-to-bumper ridiculous. Where's the little guy? Oh, he's... He's... Oh, shoot. Just got him down. So... No, no, no. First of all, just tell me, who won the match? Oh, luc and I won. You're kidding me? You beat kevrah? Yes, in a forfeit. Wait a minute... Cooper had a meltdown, so sarah had to leave. oh. so? So... Here's to my endorsements. I got 'em both. That is fantastic. It was a long shot, but I worked my magic, and as soon as hix caved, I called mccarty and... It's like I always say. What? What do you always say? Never bet against my wife. Oh. Mm. So how was the rest of your weekend? Anything important? Nothing to tell. Rebecca. Hello? hey. hey. ¶ it can be a real long road ¶ i, uh, I've been calling you. Yeah, I just needed to get out of the house so I took a run. At night? That's a little, uh, unsafe. Good thing I have reflectors on my shoes. oh. ¶ when you're on your own ¶ you want to talk? You know what, justin? I think you should do the talking. I don't know how to help you. Okay. ¶ it can be a real long ride ¶ rebecca, ever since the funeral, I've been thinking about how much jake and the inside of me. I push it down, it goes away. But then it comes back stronger. I shove it down again, but it just keeps on coming back till I don't have the strength to push anymore. I am so weak. I hate this thing inside of me. Julien. You can't go through life hating who you are. I pushed away everyone. My partner, my reverend, Tomas. I'm alone. Hey, no, you're not. You were there for me. I'm there for you. It is so nice to have someone else cook dinner. It smells incredible. Thanks. One of the keys is basil. You have to add it just before it's done otherwise you cook the flavor out of it. - Well, we wouldn't wanna do that. - No. Strainer? Today has been very emotional for you. There's a lot of delayed grief, pent-up confusion, misplaced feelings. I'm not gonna take advantage of that. Hold me. - Hey. - What's up? This whole IAD thing. - I shut you out. Looks like I was wrong. - This thing confused a lot of people. Yeah, I know. Killed my partnership. It's not too late. He's a good kid. Maybe he deserves a second chance. Most of us do. - I'll see you. - Right. - Sir. - Danny. Strike Team's back in business, effective tomorrow. - Did you ever have any doubt? - I did this time. I'm tired, Vic. I just can't keep explaining these messes or cleaning up after them. - Ben. - No. I'm not gonna let myself get burned. We're done, Vic. I just can't have your back anymore. I thought I owed it to you to tell you. One-tango-8, in pursuit of a white, four-door failing to yield, traveling eastbound, approaching Alton. One-tango-2, we will be secondary in the pursuit. Asking the Sergeant for permission to take him out here. One-tango-13, in the area, paralleling the pursuit. CHP's trying to get a tag strip here. There's cross-traffic. This is very dangerous. They've stopped. He does not get hit, goes through that intersection. There's traffic up ahead. He's gonna have to take the wrong side of the road. Julien! Don't gun it! Too many people! He's back on the wrong side. There's a vehicle! That was nearly a collision.... "Farmington Cops Investigated for Stealing Drugs"? I was sick when I saw that. The Chief dunked my balls like doughnuts in his coffee! Do you know how this got out? Yeah! You leaked it! Me? You act like a crusading cop, bucking the system. We're all hurt by this. I don't know your agenda, but no one succeeds here by being anti-cop. I'm anti-criminal, even if they're wearing a badge. I must've missed that quote in the paper. What will you do about the Strike Team? Suspend them? What about innocent till proven guilty? They can't be on the streets with these charges pending. And we can't suspend decorated officers without due process! Reassign the Strike Team to the general detective pool. Give them different partners. In the meantime, I'll see if I can figure out who leaked this. Don't bother. You want to pack your things now, or would you like a few days? "Firing the One Cop Who Cares about Cleaning Up the Department." I wonder how the Chief would like that headline? You got it all figured out, don't you? Howdy, partner. Slumming with us ordinary detectives? Don't get too excited. It's just temporary. Promises, promises. Looks like we're running together today. Yeah. There's traffic up ahead. He's trying to get.... North on Hoover. He's coming our way. Block this intersection. When it's clear, pull out, cross the street. -Shouldn't I follow? -No, you're trailing. Pull up and over, stay parallel. They'll tell us when to converge. Time to converge. What the hell am I supposed to talk to Shane Vendrell about all day? It's good to shake things up. I don't want to. I want my partner back. Aren't you sweet? Absence makes the heart grow fonder. You're gonna miss me, too, right? I called it in. Danny. Roman, pop the trunk. Got it. God! God. Could have used a higher sunscreen. God! The story's worse than you said. It's all in there. We're screwed. Give me till the end of today, this whole thing goes away. What? We'll have to make this thing go away. Heard you guys found yourselves a crispy critter. It's a miracle he's alive. Must have had it coming. You got to piss someone off to be tortured and stuck in a trunk. Nobody deserves that. He was probably a rat. Back off, Shane! Cut it out. Julien's not a rat. They run in packs now? What is your problem? Let's not make this into a bigger mess than it already is! Come on. Come on! Lay low, man. Do your work. Leave this thing to me. I'm still here. Julien. I hear you. You gotta help me out. Nothing I can do. How did that cop know about us? I don't know. I pulled some strings, got you released until your court date. -You did? -Yeah. I just need help with one thing first. I'm filling out my arrest report, and I'm a little confused. When I busted in, it looked like you had some cop's dick in your mouth. That can't be right, can it? You got something to say, say it to me. Okay. It's easy to make a mistake, especially on a bust. You think you see someone pocketing two keys of coke instead of ammo. -lt can be confusing. -He's not confused about anything. I'm not taking back my statement. See? And what you're saying that he and me did, it never happened. It never happened. What? Julien. Julien! You heard him. It never happened. -He needs me. -Aren't you full of yourself? . It's over. That's not what he said! That's what I say. He's got a lot on his mind right now. He doesn't need you complicating things. Stay away. You can't keep us apart. I've seen your sheet. Small time con men like you only care about themselves. Yeah, well, he cares about me. You don't want me hauling you in here all the time. That's what you care about, so cut him off. Man, look at this guy. I ever get that bad, pull the plug with both hands. Not me. What? You'd want that? No, but it beats the alternative. Just keep my machines juiced until the Hoover Dam's out of business. Detectives? Dr. Crawford, how's the poor sap doing? Third degree burns over most of his body? He's gonna die. Here are his things. His skin showed traces of red phosphorous and hydrogen chloride. He blew himself up in a meth lab. I see two, three of these a month. Every bozo from here to San Bernardino thinks he can cook crank. Don't know what you're Boom! Meth, courtesy of Cupid. How lovely. Meth's the drug of the day. We've got a few ODs in the ER right now. Could you take us down there for a look? -He's tweeking. -Third one today. Could I see his belongings? Over here. May we see the patient's belongings, please? Thank you. Call me if you get more. I will. Cupid's busy. Looks like our mummy cooked up some crap before blowing himself up. Let's hope he's dumb and lazy. No telling how much he churned out. Got another college kid. -How do you want to play this? -We both have our own ways that work. -Why don't we just take turns? -Take turns? We follow one lead your way, follow the next one my way. Your way won't land me in the papers, will it? -Don't believe everything you read. -Okay. Who goes first? Ladies go first. All I know is the ID of the driver, so let's start with his family. Lead the way. David. Jorge. -There's no turning back, -I know I've burned some bridges. Now's the time to build some new ones. How so? The good news this headline is exactly what we needed to brand you for the voters. -lt came out well. -I've decided to back you for City Council. I was hoping that's what this was about. Thank you. I'd like you and Aurora to join me for dinner tomorrow night. Será un placer. Bien. Bien. You can meet the rest of your team then. -I have a team? -We have a lot of work ahead of us. The neighborhood celebration on Cinco de Mayo will make a good coming-out party for you. Jorge? I promise, I'm not in this to lose. You can't afford to. Don't believe everything you read. You got to wonder where they come up with this stuff. -Anything break yet? -Nope. There's a crack den on Temple due for a toss. You want to hit it? I wish I could, but I've got to go over some open files. All righty, then. Danny. How was the sergeant's test? I don't know. It's gonna be close. I kind of froze a little. I'll bet you did great. Listen, pass or fail, I do want to thank you for tutoring me. Can I buy you dinner tomorrow? Sure. Great. Tomorrow night. You pick the place. -Can I help you? -Yes. I'm looking for Detective Gannon. I've been leaving him messages for the last two months. Detective Gannon retired last year. He was investigating a case. My husband was murdered. Here. Have a seat. Thank you. I haven't heard anything in ages. I couldn't understand why he wasn't returning my calls. What's your husband's name? Kyle Kelner. I'll pull the file. I'll be right back. So you lost your husband. A year ago today. I'm so sorry. I don't understand. I mean, why would Andy run from the police? He had a burn victim in his trunk and methamphetamine in his pocket. This doesn't make any sense. This is from my daughter's rubber stamp kit. You didn't know your husband was involved? He's a web page designer, not a drug dealer. He and his friend Eric had been looking for jobs ever since the company they worked for had gone bust. Who's Eric? Andy and Eric went to college together. I tried to reach him when I saw the chase on TV but I can't get a hold of him anywhere. I'm afraid I might know where to find Eric. I can't even look at him like that. It was a meth lab explosion. What? Meth lab? I knew that my brother was having money problems but how was I supposed to help him? He's the one who went to college. Now they're asking me to end his life. What do I do? Look, thanks for standing up for me earlier. That's what partners do, even if you don't agree. Don't agree with them? Look, this is a brotherhood. Everybody here knows that but you. -You don't know what I've been through. -You don't tell me. Decide if you want to stay partners. If you do, start opening up. If you don't, talk to Aceveda. Car's clean. He already turned me down when I asked him for a new partner. Maybe he'll give you a different answer. There's an unserved warrant. Year-old lottery ticket. Weight Watchers coupon. Like that lard ass would ever use it. He just dumped his desk drawer into this box. The clock ran out on this case a year ago. I'm not shoveling the ice off the clue trail. We owe it to her. No, Gannon owes her. You want me to fly solo? No. Looks like it's the only action I'm gonna get today. Excuse me? The "I lost my husband but I'm still young and hot... "...and need of an emotional release" kind of sex? You're kidding, right? What? You've never covered an accident or homicide and gone back a month later for a statement? This one's been hanging on the vine for a year. She is ripe. Just give me two minutes, Fran! She say you only last two minutes! About as long as it'll take me to whup your ass! I'm telling you what! Why you wanna go there? Wait a minute. You guys again? Weren't you with you, and we busted you for slashing his tires? Man, that was in the past! Today you need to arrest him for trespassing! You got to own something for me to trespass, welfare nigger! My job is getting nasty with Fran. Fran, don't do this! We together now! What you want? Let me talk! Give me two minutes, girl! -You don't have two. -Then give me one minute! We're through, Hooper! Fran, don't do this! She won't give you the time of day. Stop! He don't deserve you, girl! Get on inside. Come on. Come on, now! Don't do this, baby! Querida? I'm finishing the marketing plan. It has to be done before I fly to Houston. Don't think you're getting any. Is that any way to talk to the next City Councilman? My God. Machado said yes? We're having dinner tomorrow night to meet the team. The team? David! I can't believe it. Why aren't you more excited? This is my shot. I won't get another. You won't need another. Power is an aphrodisiac. Died about 20 minutes ago. Second, so far. Third one scrambled his brains. And all from the same college. We better find this stuff, or you'll be stacking them higher. Ambulances bring them in? All but that one. Who brought him? That guy over there. Police. You knew the OD victim? He was rushing my frat. I'm the Pledge Master. This part of Rush Week? -My father's a lawyer. -Mine was a bricklayer. So what? Fowler, Kaufman Rose. You want to talk to me, talk to them. We are definitely doing this one my way. Get the hell off me! You wanted him to be your brother? Yeah. Kiss your brother. Stop that! Where'd he get the meth? Please, no! -Where'd he get it? -I don't know! Fine! Kiss your brother again! We gave it to all the pledges! It was supposed to be funny, sending them to class on speed! Jesus! Where'd you get it from? Effi! Effi Montecito! He deals to all the frats. Good. Now let me show you how we haze our pledges. Detective Gannon left a long list of TBIs. "To be interviewed." So we're starting from scratch. What exactly was your husband's business? Property management. He owned condos, rented them out. And he was found at a construction site? Yeah. He and his partner Ari were building a new complex. Was he meeting someone? I don't know. I had just gotten home from my parents' when the police called. -I'm sorry. -lt's okay. -Here you go. -Thank you. Look, I'll get you some chips. Thanks. Have you talked to anyone, like a grief counselor? Didn't help. I know some that are very good. I don't know. It's already been a year. I'm sure it feels like it was yesterday when you got that call. Our dealer Effi's a 25-year-old still living in his old frat house. -Can't seem to grow up. -He'll grow up fast in San Quentin. Real fast. It'll take a few hours to get the warrant. I'll start. Not a problem. I got some errands to run, anyway. What's going on? This IAD thing's still hanging out there. -I told you. I'm not changing my statement. -I'm willing to keep your secret. -Sure, you are. -I am! What do you think, I want to twist your arm? -All you got to do is-- -Lie? It's not a lie. You made a mistake. We put boxes of ammo in that bag, not bricks of coke. I know what ammo looks like, and blackmail, too. It's not gonna work. I got nothing to lose. My guys have taken fire from every scumbag in town. They're going down because some rookie thinks he saw something? I did see something. I'm not gonna let you destroy their lives. So you're gonna try and destroy mine? You're not giving me any choice. Handing in this arrest report's the only way I can stop you from making a huge mistake. That report doesn't prove anything. I don't have to prove you're gay. In this house, all I got to do is say it and all the gory details. There you go. All right. Vic! I'm not sure they stole any drugs. What? It was dark. They were at the other end. My view was obstructed. You never said your view was obstructed. It was. You didn't see Mackey put bricks of cocaine into a weapons bag? I can't be positive. You didn't see Shane Vendrell drive off with that bag? I don't know for sure what was in it. -Mackey got to you. -No. He threatened you. We can get him for that. He didn't. Then what? Maybe I let his reputation cloud my judgment. Question. "Are you positive it was two kilos of cocaine?" Answer. "Yes. " I'm not sure anymore. Julien, failure to report corruption and giving false testimony are both serious offenses. I'll accept whatever punishment I have to. Sorry to disappoint you. Yeah! I told you it would go away. -How'd you get him to back off? . -I reasoned with the man. You are my personal hero. Get out. Sure, boss. I got a big case I'm working. -What did you do to him? -To who? Officer Lowe. Nothing. Is he okay? He changed his statement. IAD hasn't notified me. If anything happens to him.... Can't see why it would. Listen, I got to run. I'm touring a school for my kid. Sorry your headlines got screwed up. What now? Look at this. "Hoe"? Goddamn bastard call her that for everybody to see. How do you know Hooper did this? Hooper's not a very good speller. Look it over. Sign right there. -So he can't come within 10 feet? -That's a restraining order. -This complaint can justify it. -What if he comes near me? Then I'll make him my bitch. Now sign it. -Sometimes I see him at the Vons. -Vons? What Vons? -He helps with my shopping. -Helps you with your shopping? Hell, no! That stops right here! Back off. Just let her think it through. She don't need to think. -She needs to sign it! -Okay. It's all good. So you were Kyle Kelner's business partner. Until he died. Where were you on the night he died? I told the detective last year. I was in Phoenix on business. Why are you just getting around to Kyle's murder now? Unfortunately, the file slipped through a crack in the system. Judging from today's newspaper, I'm surprised any crack slips past you guys. Those are just allegations. Sure. Got to stick up for your own. I understand. He got along with everyone. Nice, funny, a great boss, you know? Wish I could find another one like him. I haven't had a decent job since he died. Must be real tough on you. Yeah. Yeah. It's times like this when you need someone to lean on like a husband or boyfriend. I'm single. Our specialized care is made to meet the needs of autistic children including speech, occupational, behavior therapies. The facilities are really nice. I read that if you put a kid with other autistic kids it keeps them from socializing, sort of lowering the bar. Some people think that but we've seen that autistic children progress best in a small class with other kids their own level. How does this compare with the public schools? The pilot programs? You risk Matthew being put in a typical class with an aide. What's wrong with that? Throwing him in the pool won't teach him to swim. Here, Matthew will be a leader, he'll gain more confidence. So he won't be behind anymore. We have one spot available. It's sure to go quickly. $25,000 is pretty steep. Our services aren't cheap but you ask any of the parents here, they'll tell you it's worth it. It seems wonderful. I know it's an important decision, but I suggest you make it quickly. Excuse me. Julien. Reverend, why are you here? Your captain said you were struggling with a decision and need spiritual guidance. For some reason, thought I might be able to help. Come on. Police stations make me nervous. I need a smoke. I went back on my statement because I'm not sure what I saw. Why did you sign it in the first place? I don't know. Too eager to do the right thing? I overreacted. I know an overreactor when I see one. That's not you. What's going on, Julien? What do you do when the man that you are isn't the man that you want to be? Give the man that you are a kick in the ass. What's stopping you? Nothing. I'll be all right. Only thing better than unfiltered smoke unfiltered prayer. Just you and God, no secrets nothing in between. See you Sunday? Yeah. Okay, come on, boys. Of course. You want to go in there unprotected? Let's go, ladies. Who's up? Are you serious? Tim, you just volunteered. Who's that? Who the hell are you? Decency police. Let me guess, Effi Montecito? Yeah. You're coming with us. What? This one we do my way. If you feel we have time for that. I thought screwing sheep went out with New Wave. We wouldn't really make them do it. Right. We just wanted to see who would. Wait, you dragged my son here for a schoolboy prank? Your son's here on suspicion of drug trafficking. What? Dad, it's not true. So far, three students at Mission Cross Hospital have died from your Cupid crystal meth. That wasn't mine. Apparently he supplies half of fraternity row. We have to get his latest batch off the street before more kids die. You're dealing drugs again? Dad, they can't prove anything. You're 25 years old! Grow up, will you? You stupid son of a bitch! -What the hell's the matter with you? -Stop! Your stuff has killed somebody! Guard! You know what you're doing to your family? Go on! Let them take you! Go on, you stupid piece of shit! You see if I'm gonna bail you out this time! I like doing things your way. I told them to take the life support away. Son, I don't mean to be disingenuous, but I'm sorry. What's disingenuous mean? Means you're under arrest. -For what? -For shaking and baking crystal meth. I don't know anything about that. We talked to Effi. He rolled on you, you roll on him. Eric was mixing up a batch, and it exploded and he was screaming. His flesh was.... We couldn't take him to the hospital. So you tossed him in the trunk. Andy was gonna bury him in the desert. He was still alive. We thought that he would die by the time that we got there. Exactly how stupid are you? You're six credits shy of graduating for the last four years. You're a drug dealer who spends his free time watching pledges hump sheep, and he's the stupid one? Any more bad crank still out there? Only the stuff that Manny's holding for collateral. Who's Manny? He's who we borrowed the money from to start the meth lab. When we couldn't pay right away, he smashed up my hand and he took half of the drugs as collateral. How much is half? . 10 pounds. There's still 10 pounds of this shit out there? Goddamn it. If he hadn't of threatened us, Eric wouldn't have rushed the last batch and he would still be alive. Who is this Manny guy? Manny Sandoval. Manny Sandoval skated two murders I should have had him for. I've wanted this bastard for a year. If he's so bad, how come I never heard of him? Supercop, you know every criminal on the street? After we catch this guy, I will. You want me to give you $20,000? You can't be serious. That's what our meth men owe this Manny. They're both willing to wear a wire. Nail him at the drop, get the bad dope out of circulation. Stop. You're under investigation for stealing drugs. I should give you cash? Don't give it to Vic. Give it to me so we can save some lives. When do you need it? Tomorrow. So long as we're clear, I'm giving the money to you. Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. I tried to call, but the phone's disconnected. Yeah. -Is everything okay? -Yeah. I just, forgot to pay the bill. But it'll be on in a couple of days, so.... No problem. I need to check on one thing, and I'll be out of your hair. Did your husband have business ties to Phoenix? I don't think so. I know Ari has family there. Your husband's partner? Yeah. He was visiting them the night that Kyle was killed. I called one of those grief counselors you recommended. Yeah? Have an appointment on Tuesday. Good. I'm glad. -Thank you. -Detective, do you have to.... Thanks for taking care of this. Thanks. My pleasure. Good night. 'Bye. I called the Reverend Cook because I was worried. I know this is tough. You shouldn't have. I don't know what Mackey did or said but I know it took fortitude to come forward in the first place. Where's that fortitude now? I made a mistake. Yes, you have and I want to help you rectify it. I don't want your help. You should contact your PBA rep. You're facing suspension, probably termination. I wish you'd gone down a different way. We can skip the trip to Lake Powell this year. I can go back to work at the ER, pick up some shifts per diem. And spend half the money you make on day care. We'll lose that spot. He'll go to school in the real world, learn to socialize. I want him in Glenridge. He'll be happy there. I know it. You know it, too. All right. Call them tomorrow. I'll have to pick up extra shifts. We barely see you enough now. What do you want from me? I'm not mad. We just miss you. Matthew ruined my notebook. Let me see. You know what? We'll get you a new one, okay? Why does he do stuff like that? He never listens. Matthew listens. He just understands things differently. Come here. See how you make your letters so neat get them to fit inside the lines? Yeah. Matthew he doesn't know how to make things fit. He needs help with that kind of stuff. Big sister help? Yeah. Big sister help. Come here. Big sister help. It'll be okay. It's not okay. You don't deserve this. So much for riding that headline onto the City Council. -You're more than just that headline. -Not to Machado. -When he hears that the case fell apart-- -If he backs out, what happens to your job? Gilroy's getting squeezed. First chance he gets, he's gonna take it out on me. There's got to be something you can do. I can't think of what. I really thought this was my shot. I'm so sorry. I knew twice in one day was too much to hope for. "Shoe"? What are you doing here? -I told you, I only needed two minutes. -He bumped into me at the Vons. Who painted that "S"? I couldn't scrub off "hoe," so I figured that was the next best thing. -Why are we here? -Lamar slashed my tires again. He gets jealous. I want my name off that restraining order and put Lamar's name on there. -That's not gonna be a problem, is it? -You, come with me. We hooked up at the Vons! Apparently, these guys will do anything for you. They're serious, and you're leading them on. I am not. Yeah, you are. Now stop stringing them along. Just pick one and stick with him. It's the right thing to do. Go to Phoenix often, Ari? Sometimes. Who did you meet the night that Kyle was killed? A business acquaintance. Did you have dinner? No, I got in around 9:30. We had drinks. Did you get a chance to see your family? Family? No, not that trip. 9:30. So, you were on the 8:00 flight? Exactly. I checked the flight manifests. Your flight flew out at 10:00. You want to tell me something, Ari? You did it, ass wipe! Say it! Yes, I killed him! I didn't plan it! He just found out I was stealing money from our joint account. He accused me. I got scared, and I just killed him. I didn't have a plan. I didn't have an alibi. Why didn't you guys arrest me last year? That rocked! Man, you set him up I knocked him down. Yeah. You are great. Don't you just once wish you worked for Beverly Hills P.D.? I'll bet you their wires work. You don't like the WWII hand-me-downs? You guys still owe me $20-- The lab exploded. Not my problem. You want the drugs? 30 percent. Damn. Did he say it? I can't hear. Your brother blew up-- 'Cause of you, son of a bitch! Stop, you goddamn crazy kid! My eye! He'd still be alive.... What is this, is this a bug? You taping me, bitch? You taping me? I'm gonna kill you. Drop it! Don't make me kill you! Self-defense, man! Crazy bastard was trying to kill me! Paul just attacked him. He ruined everything. -I told you, he's stupid. -He killed Eric! Okay, he killed my brother! This doesn't screw up my deal, does it? Your informant attacks me while working a case for you? My lawyer will buy a new home off of this. -You were ready to kill Paul! -But I didn't. -And even if I did, it was self-defense. -Why don't we let a jury sort that out? Some kids croaked on meth, right? You put me behind bars, not only won't those charges stick there's a good chance that stuff gets on the street. You sick bastard. Only when I have to be. We gonna help each other out, or what? Why would Ari kill him? He was siphoning off money from the business. Kyle caught him red-handed. He was gonna blow the whistle. -Thank you, detectives. -Don't mention it. It's our job. I'll check in on you in a few weeks, just to make sure you're doing okay. I hope you keep that appointment. This is a lot to take in, I know. I thought I'd be okay, knowing what happened. It doesn't make it any better. It doesn't change anything. He's still not gonna be there when I get home, is he? I just don't want to be alone anymore. Listen, Danny, I know this is short notice, but I have to break our.... Cancel our dinner tonight. Everything all right? Yeah. A friend of mine's having a crisis. It's no problem. I'm really sorry. I'll just work a double. I can use the extra cash. Great. We'll do it soon. They swept the whole area. Garbage cans, dumpsters, crawl spaces, nothing. -What about his place? -No cupid in sight. Ten pounds of junk is out there. Enough to kill dozens, and he's holding all the cards. This might be a good time for us to start doing things my way. And what way would that be, exactly? Captain. Didn't see you there. Someone should put a bell around your neck. Where are we with this meth thing? Between a rock and a hard place. Looks like we're gonna have to do this Manny's way. The drugs were right where you said they'd be. Lucky guess. You're welcome for the public service. Pleasure doing business with you. You picked the right day to cross paths with me. I was handcuffed. You guys got a lot of rules. You know something? You might not have pulled any triggers but a lot of people are dead because of you. You're on my radar now. Okay. Trust me that's not a good thing. Just have fun tonight. They're all dying to meet you. That's why I'm here. It kills me, Jorge, but this whole thing fell apart. The key witness got cold feet. The investigation's dead. I wanted you to hear it from me. That's not ideal. But it's not disaster, either. David, people remember the headlines. Most times, they don't even read past them. -This being politics.... -Perception is reality. Learning fast. Don't worry about it, I live up to my promises. You're my man. Get used to it. I see you at 8:00. How'd things go with Mackey today? Fine. Good. I missed you, too, okay? You happy? It doesn't matter to me. How was your day? Shane wants to hit the monster truck rally on Friday. Got to stop meeting like this. People are gonna talk. Not about anything they heard from me. Hey. It might not feel like it but you did the right thing yesterday. I'm not gay. -Julien, come on. -I'm not. It's this thing inside of me. I push it down, it goes away but then it comes back stronger. I shove it down again, but it just keeps on coming back till I don't have the strength to push anymore. God. I am so weak. I hate this thing inside of me. Julien. You can't go through life hating who you are. I pushed away everyone my partner, my reverend, Tomas. I'm alone. No, you're not. You were there for me. I'm there for you. It is so nice to have someone else cook dinner. It smells incredible. Thanks. One of the keys is basil. You have to add it just before it's done, otherwise you'll cook the flavor out of it. -We wouldn't want to do that. -No. Strainer? Today has been very emotional for you. There's a lot of delayed grief pent up confusion, misplaced feelings. I'm not gonna take advantage of that. You wouldn't be. Hey. What's up? This whole IAD thing.... I shut you out. Looks like I was wrong. This thing confused a lot of people. Yeah, I know. It killed my partnership. It's not too late. He's a good kid. Maybe he deserves a second chance. Most of us do. I'll see you. Right. Sir. Danny. The Strike Team's back in business, effective tomorrow. Did you ever have any doubt? I did this time. I'm tired, Vic. I just can't keep explaining these messes or cleaning up after them. Ben. I'm not gonna let myself get burned. We're done, Vic. I just can't have your back anymore. I thought I owed it to you to tell you. . Previously on The Shield: –Someone slashed your tires? –Was the real police busy today? –Any idea who might've done this? –Lamar. He's my ex. Lamar Tilton? We're investigating vandalism... to a car owned by your ex-girlfriend. –You mean the tires I slashed? That's my book. The reason I have it is because Matthew has autism. That doesn't mean Vic and his guys didn't steal drugs. –But without evidence... –I saw them pocket cocaine. Cops here will treat you like a traitor. You ready for that kind of heat? –I'll have to be. –We need to keep this under control. I'll talk to my people, make sure there are no leaks on this end. This is an IAD file of an investigation my people are trying to cover up. –Dirty cops? –You'll see it gets publicity. Don't worry, David. I'll make sure they spell your name right. You have an open warrant for your arrest. Don't worry. Your boyfriend'll lock up. Won't you, officer? One Tango Eight in pursuit of a white four-door... failing to yield traffic eastbound on Fox Ave approaching Alden. One Tango Two, we will be secondary in the pursuit. Asking the sergeant for permission to tak e him out here. One Tango 13, show is in the area. Paralleling the pursuit on Tambor. CHP is trying to get a tag strip here. There's cross-traffic. This is very dangerous. They've stopped. He mak es his way through that intersection. There's traffic up ahead. He's gonna have to tak e the wrong side of the road! Julien! Don't gun it! Too many people! On the wrong side of the road again! There's a vehicle! That was nearly a collision! Farmington cops investigated for stealing drugs? The chief dunked my balls like a couple of doughnuts in his coffee. –You have any idea how this got out? –Yeah! You leaked it! –Me? –You come across like a crusading... cop bucking the system. –We're all hurt. No one succeeds in this department by being anti-cop. I'm anti-criminal. Even if they're wearing a badge. I must've missed that quote in the paper. What're you gonna do about the Strike Team? Suspend them? –Innocent until proven guilty. –Can't have them running the streets... with these charges pending. –And we can't suspend officers... without due process. Reassign the team to the general detective pool. –Stick them with different partners. –In the meantime, I'll see if I can... figure out who leaked this. –Don't bother. Do you wanna pack your things now or would you like a few days? Firing the one cop who actually cares about cleaning up the department. I wonder how the chief would like that headline. You got it all figured out, don't you? –Howdy, partner. –Slumming with us ordinary detectives. Don't get too excited. It's just temporary. Promises, promises. Looks like we're running together today. –Yeah. –There's traffic up ahead. –He's trying to get... –Northbound, over. It's coming our way. Block this intersection. –When we're clear, cross the street. –Shouldn't I follow? No, you're trailing. Pull up and over. They'll tell us when to converge. Time to converge. What the hell am I supposed to talk to Shane Vendrell about all day? It's good to shake things up. I don't wanna shake things up. I want my partner back. Aren't you sweet? Well, absence makes the heart grow fonder. You're gonna miss me too, right? I called it in. ETA, three minutes. Back a block! Danny! –Broman, pop the trunk. –Got it. God! Oh, God. Could've used a higher sunscreen. The story's even worse than you said. It's all in there. We're screwed! The story's even worse than you said. It's all in there. We're screwed! Give me till the end of the day, this thing goes away. What're you talking about? We're gonna have to make this thing go... –Heard you guys found a crispy critter. –It's a miracle he's still alive. Must've had it coming. You gotta piss somebody off to have them... torture you and stick you in a trunk. –Nobody deserves that. –He was probably a rat. –Hey! –Back off! –Cut it out! –Julien's not a rat. –They run in packs now? –What is your problem? –Vic! Hey! Hey! Let's not make this into a bigger mess. Come on. Come on! Lay low, man. Do your work. Leave this thing to me. Hey. Hey! I'm still here. –Julien... –I hear you. –Well, you gotta help me out. –Nothing I can do. –How did that cop know about us? –I don't know. Pulled some strings. Got you released until your court date. –You did? –Yeah. I just need help with one thing first. I'm filling out my report, and I'm a little confused. When I busted in, it looked like you had some cop's dick in your mouth. That can't be right. Can it? You got something to say, say it to me. Okay. It's easy to make a mistake, especially on a bust. You think you see someone pocketing coke instead of boxes of ammo. –It can be confusing. –He's not confused about anything. –I'm not taking back my statement. –See? And what you're saying that he and me did, it never happened. It never happened. What? Julien. Julien! –You heard him. It never happened. –He needs me. –Aren't you full of yourself? It's over. –That's not what he said. That's what I say. He's got a lot on his mind right now. He doesn't need you complicating things. Stay away. –You can't keep us apart. –I've seen your sheet. Small-time con men like you only care about themselves. Yeah, well, he cares about me. You don't want me hauling you in every week. That's what you care about. So cut him off. Oh, man, look at this guy. I ever get that bad, pull the plug with both hands. –Not me. –What? You'd want that? No, but it beats the alternative. Just keep my machines juiced until the Hoover Dam's out of business. –Detectives. –Dr Crawford. How's the poor sap? Third-degree burns over 60 percent of his body. He's gonna die. Here are his things. The skin showed traces of red phosphorus and hydrogen chloride. –He blew himself up in a meth lab. –I'm seeing two, three of these a month. Every bozo from here to San Bernardino thinks he can cook crank. Don't know what you're doing, boom. Meth. Courtesy of Cupid. –How lovely. –Meth's the drug of the day. We've got a few ODs in the ER right now. Could you take us down there, give us a look? –Oh, he's tweaking. –Third one today. –Could I see the patient's belongings? –Over here. May we see the patient's belongings please? Thank you. –Call me if you get any more. –I will. Cupid's busy. Looks like our mummy cooked up some crap before blowing himself up. Let's hope he's dumb and lazy. No telling how much he churned out. Got another college kid. –How do you want to play this? –We both have our own ways that work. –Why don't we just take turns. –Take turns? We follow one lead your way, next one my way. Your way's not gonna land me in the papers, is it? –Don't believe everything you read. –Okay. Who goes first? –Ladies go first. –All I know is the ID of the driver... so let's start with his family. –Lead the way. –David. –Jorge. –There's no turning back, huh? –I know I've burned some bridges. –Now's the time to build new ones. –How so? The good news. This headline is exactly what we needed to brand you for the voters. –It came out well. –I've decided to back you... for City Council. I was hoping that's what this was about. Thank you. I would like you and Aurora to join me for dinner tomorrow. You can meet the rest of your team then. –I have a team? –We have a lot of work ahead of us. The celebration on Cinco de Mayo will make a good coming-out party for you. Jorge. I promise, I'm not in this to lose. You can't afford to. Don't believe everything you read. You gotta wonder where they come up with this stuff. –Anything break yet? –No. There's a crack den on Temple due for a toss. Want to hit it? I wish I could. I've gotta go over some open files. Alrighty then. Danny! How was the sergeant's test? I don't know. It's gonna be close. I kind of froze a little. I'll bet you did great. Listen, pass or fail, I do want to thank you for tutoring me. –Can I buy you dinner tomorrow night? –Sure. Great. Tomorrow night. You pick the place. –Can I help you with that? –Sure, yeah. –Can I help you? –Yes. I'm looking for Det. Gannon. I've been leaving him messages for the last two months. Det. Gannon retired last year. Well, he was investigating a case. My husband was murdered. –Here, have a seat. –Thank you. I haven't heard anything in ages. I couldn't understand why he wasn't returning my calls. –What's your husband's name? –Kyle Kelner. I'll pull the file. I'll be right back. So you lost your husband. –Year ago today. –I'm so sorry. I don't understand. I mean, why would Andy run from the police? He had a burn victim in his trunk and methamphetamine in his pocket. This doesn't make any sense. This is from my daughter's rubber-stamp kit. You didn't know your husband was involved in this? He's a web-page designer, not a drug dealer. He and his friend Eric have been looking for jobs... ever since the company they worked for had gone bust. –Who's Eric? –They went to college together. I tried to reach him when I saw the chase on TV... but I can't get ahold of him. I'm afraid I might know where to find Eric. –I can't even look at him like that. –It was a meth-lab explosion. What? Meth lab? I knew that my brother was having money problems. You know, but how was I supposed to help him? He's the one who went to college. Now they're asking me to end his life. What do I do? Thanks for standing up for me earlier. That's what partners do. Even if you don't agree with them. –Don't agree with them? –Look, this is a brotherhood. Everybody knows that but you. –You don't know what I been through. –Because you don't tell me. Decide if you wanna stay partners. If you do, start opening up. If you don't, talk to Aceveda. Car's clean. He turned me down when I asked him for a new partner. Maybe he'll give you a different answer. –Here's an unserved warrant. –Year-old lottery ticket. Weight Watchers coupon. Like that lard-ass would ever use it. He just dumped his desk drawer into this box. Clock ran out on this case a year ago. I'm not shovelling ice off the clue trail. –Well, we owe it to her. –No, Gannon owes her. You want me to fly solo? No, man. Looks like this is the only action I'm gonna get today. –Excuse me? –The I lost my husband tragically... but I'm young, hot and in need of an emotional release sex. –You're kidding, right? –What? You've never covered some homicide and gone back later for a statement? This one's been hanging on the vine for a year, man. She is ripe. –Get out of here! She's with me now. –Just give me two minutes, man. –She say you only last two minutes. –As long as it takes to whup your ass. –Hey. Hey, hey, hey! –Tell me, what?! –What you wanna do, then? –Wait a minute. You guys again? Weren't you with you and we busted you for slashing his tires? That's the past. Today you need to be arresting him for trespassing. You gotta own something for me to be trespassing, welfare nigga! –Man, my job is getting nasty with Fran. –Come on, Fran, don't do this, baby. –We together now. What you want? –Fran, give me two minutes, girl. –She's not giving you two minutes. –Give me one minute. –We're through, Hooper. –Fran, don't do this. –She's not giving you the time of day. –Don't do that, Fran. –He don't deserve you, girl. –Get on inside. Come on. Fran. Come on, now, don't do this, baby! Finishing the marketing plan. Has to be done before I fly to Houston. –Don't think you're getting any. –Is that any way... to talk to the next city councilman? –Oh, my God. Machado said yes? We're having dinner at his house tomorrow to meet the team. The team? Oh, David. I can't believe it. So why aren't you more excited? This is my shot. I won't get another. You won't need another one. Power is an aphrodisiac. Died about 20 minutes ago. Second, so far. Third one scrambled his brains, and all from the same college. We better find this stuff, or you'll be stacking them up in the freezer. –Ambulances bring them all in? –All but that one. Who brought him? That guy over there. Police. You knew the OD victim? He was rushing my frat. I'm the pledgemaster. This part of rush week? –My father's a lawyer. –Mine was a bricklayer. So what? Fowler, Coughlin Rose. You wanna talk to me, talk to them. We are definitely doing this one my way. Get the hell off me! –You want him to be your brother? –Yeah. –Kiss your brother. –Stop! –Where'd he get the meth? –Please, no! –Where'd he get it? –I don't know! Fine. Kiss your brother again. We gave it to all the pledges! It was supposed to be funny, sending them to class on speed. –Jesus. –Where'd he get it from? Effi. Effi Montecito. He deals to all the frats. Good. Now let me show you how we haze our pledges. Detective Gannon left a long list of TBIs... Detective Gannon left a long list of TBIs... to be interviewed. So we're starting from scratch. What exactly was your husband's business? Property management. He owned condos, rented them out. And he was found at a construction site? Yeah, he and his partner Ari were building a new complex. Was he meeting someone? I don't know. I... I had just gotten home from my parents' when the police called. –I'm sorry. –It's okay. –Here you go. –Thank you. –I'll get you some chips. –Thanks. Have you talked to anyone, like a grief counsellor? Didn't help. –I know some that are very good. –I don't know. It's already been a year. I'm sure it feels like it was yesterday when you got that call. Our dealer Effi is a 25-year-old still living in his old frat house. –Can't seem to grow up? –He'll grow up fast in San Quentin. Real fast. It'll take a few hours to get the warrant. I'll start. Not a problem. I got some errands to run, anyway. What's going on? This IAD thing's still hanging out there. I told you. I'm not changing my statement. –I'm willing to keep your secret. –Sure you are. I am. What do you think, I'm gonna twist your arm? –All you gotta do is... –Lie? It's not a lie. You made a mistake. We put boxes of ammo in that bag, not bricks of coke. I know what ammo looks like, and I know what blackmail looks like too. –It's not gonna work. –I got nothing to lose. My guys have taken fire from every scumbag in town. They're going down because some rookie thinks he saw something? I did see something. I'm not gonna let you destroy their lives. So you're gonna try and destroy mine? You're not giving me any choice. Handing in this arrest report is the only way I can think to stop you... from making a huge mistake. –That report doesn't prove anything. I don't have to prove you're gay. In this house, all I gotta do is say it with all the gory details. –There you go. –All right. Vic! –I'm not sure they stole any drugs. –What? It was dark. They were at the other end. My view was obstructed. You never said your view was obstructed. Well, it was. You didn't see Mackey put two bricks of cocaine into a weapons bag? I can't be positive. You didn't see Shane Vendrell drive off with that bag? –I don't know for sure what was in it. –Mackey got to you. He threatened you. We can get him for that too. –He didn't. –Then what? Maybe I let his reputation cloud my judgment. Question: Are you positive it was two kilos of cocaine? Answer: Yes. I'm not sure anymore. Julien, failure to report corruption and giving false testimony... are both serious offences. I'll accept whatever punishment I have to. I'm sorry to disappoint you. –Yeah! –I told you it would go away. –How'd you get him to back off? –I reasoned with the man. You are my personal hero. –Get out. –Sure. I got a big case I'm working. –What did you do to him? –To who? –Officer Lowe. –Nothing. –Is he okay? –He changed his statement. IAD hasn't notified me. If anything happens to him... Can't see why it would. Listen, I gotta run. I'm touring a school for my kid. Oh, sorry your headlines got screwed up. –What now? –Look at this. Hoe? Goddamn bastard called her that for everybody to see. –How do you know Hooper did this? –Hooper's not a very good speller. Look it over. Sign right there. So he can't come within 10 feet of me? That's a restraining order. You can use this to justify one. –So, what if he comes near me? –Then I make him my bitch. Now sign it. –Sometimes I see him at the Vons. –Vons? What Vons? –Well, he helps with my shopping. –Helps with your shopping? –Hell, no. That stops right here. –Back off. Just let her think it through. She needs to sign the damn thing. Okay, baby. It's all good. So you were Kyle Kelner's business partner. –Until he died. –Where were you on the night he died? I told the detective last year. I was in Phoenix on business. Why are you just getting around to Kyle's murder now? Unfortunately, the file slipped through a crack in the system. Judging from today's newspaper... I'm surprised any crack slips past you guys. Well, those are just allegations. Sure. Gotta stick up for your own. I understand. He got along with everyone. Nice, funny. A great boss, you know? Wish I could find another one like him. Haven't had a decent job since he died. –Must be real tough on you. –Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's times like this when you need someone to lean on. –Like a husband or boyfriend or... –I'm single. Our specialized care is designed to meet the needs of autistic children... including speech, occupational, behaviour therapies. The facilities are really nice. One of the books I read said if you put a kid with other autistic kids... it keeps them from socializing. Sort of lowering the bar. Some people think that. But we've seen that autistic children progress... most rapidly in a small class with other kids their own level. How does this compare with public schools, pilot programs? You risk Matthew being placed in a typical class with an aide. –What's wrong with that? –Throwing them in the deep end... won't teach them how to swim. Here Matthew will be a leader. He'll gain more confidence. So he won't be behind anymore. We have one spot available. It's sure to go quickly. Twenty-five grand is pretty steep. Services we provide aren't cheap. You ask any of the parents here, they'll tell you it's worth it. It seems wonderful. I know it's a big decision, but I suggest you make it quickly. Excuse me. –Julien. –Reverend. What are you doing here? Your captain called. He said you were struggling with a decision. Some reason, thought I might be able to help. Come on, police stations make me nervous. I need a smoke. I went back on my statement because I'm not sure what I saw. What made you sign it in the first place? I don't know. Too eager to do the right thing. I overreacted. I know an overreactor when I see one. That's not you. What's going on, Julien? What do you do when the man that you are isn't the man that you wanna be? Then you give the man that you are a swift kick in the ass. What's stopping you? Nothing. I'll be all right. Only thing better than unfiltered smoke. Unfiltered prayer. Just you and God. No secrets. Nothing in between. See you Sunday? Yeah. Okay. Come on, boys. –Let's go, ladies. Who's up? –Are you serious about this? Hey, what's happening? –Who the hell are you? –Decency police. –Let me guess. Effi Montecito? –Yeah. –You're coming with us. –What? –This one we do my way. –If you feel we have time for that. Hey! I thought screwing sheep went out with New Wave. We weren't really gonna make them do it. We just wanted to see who would. Wait. You dragged my son here for a schoolboy prank like this? Your son's here on suspicion of drug trafficking. –What? –Dad, it's not true. So far, three students at Mission Cross Hospital... have died from your Cupid crystal meth. That wasn't mine. Apparently he supplies half of fraternity row. We have to get this batch off the street before more kids die. –You dealing drugs again? Goddamn it. –Dad, they can't prove anything. You're 25 years old. Grow up, would you? You stupid son of a bitch. –What the hell's the matter with you? –Stop! –Your stuff is killing... –Shut up! Hey, hey, hey, that's enough! Don't you know what you're doing to your family? Go on. Let them take you. Go on. You stupid piece of shit! You see if I'm gonna bail you out this time. I like doing things your way. I told them to take the life support away. Son, I don't mean to be disingenuous, but I'm sorry. –What's disingenuous mean? –Means you're under arrest. –For what? –For shaking and baking crystal meth. –I don't know anything about that. –We talked to Effi. He rolled on you, you roll on him. Eric was mixing up a batch and it exploded and he was screaming. His flesh was... We couldn't take him to the hospital. So you tossed him in a trunk. Andy was gonna bury him in the desert. He was still alive. We thought that he'd die by the time that we got there. Exactly how stupid are you? You're six credits shy of graduating for the last four years. You're a drug dealer who spends his time watching pledges hump sheep. –And he's the stupid one? –Any more bad crank still out there? Only the stuff Manny's holding for collateral. Who's Manny? He's the guy we borrowed the money from to start the meth lab. When we couldn't pay right away, he smashed up my hand... and he took half of the drugs as collateral. –How much is half? –Ten pounds. There's still 10 pounds of this shit out there? –Goddamn it. –If he hadn't threatened us... Eric wouldn't have rushed the last batch and he would still be alive. –All right. Who is this Manny guy? –Manny Sandoval. Manny Sandoval skated two murders I should've had him for. I've wanted this bastard for a year. If he's so bad, how come I never heard of him? You know every criminal on the street? After we catch this guy, I will. You want me to give you $20·000? You can't be serious. That's what our meth men owe this Manny. They're both willing to wear a wire. Nail him at the drop. Get the bad dope out of circulation. Vic, stop. You're under investigation for stealing drugs. –I'm supposed to give you cash? –You're not giving it to Vic. You're giving it to me. So we can save some lives. –When do you need it? –Tomorrow. So long as we're clear, I'm giving the money to you. –Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. –Hey. I tried to call, but the phone's disconnected. –Is everything okay? –Oh, yeah. I just forgot to pay the bill. –But it'll be on in a couple days, so... –No problem. I need to check on one thing, and I'll leave. Did your husband have business ties to Phoenix? I don't think so. I know Ari has family there. –Your husband's partner? –Yeah. He was visiting them the night that Kyle was killed. Hey, I called one of those grief counsellors you recommended. –Yeah? –I have an appointment on Tuesday. Good. I'm glad. –Well, thank you. I'll... –Detective, do you have to...? season. - It would be easier if you just give me your money. - Yes it would. What do you say to $50? - Okay, you're on. - Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently. Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades. Oh God! You remember when we got these? No. I guess you weren't there. You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember? I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving. I'm gonna miss you so much. Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss. I don't think there's anything. Come on, there's gotta be something. Nope, she's perfect. I have one. Good! Great! You can go first. Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen? Aw, sometimes. Always, actually. Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better? Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages. You get your messages! Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch. So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? Great! It worked! No one's sad. Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food. Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000. - You serious? - Oh yes! - Okay, get ready to owe me! - Okay. Okay, here we go. Ready? No! No! No! No? One can beat me. See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me! Ooh, your brother. Score! What's up? Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi. Oh, put him on! Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later. Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades? You know what else I'm not gonna miss? " I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!" "Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!" "I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!" Hey! I call her! "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!" "Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"' Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. Still broken? This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life. The foosball table and..... $500. Well, there are other ways of winning back your money. How about a little uh, a little Blackjack? Nah, not my game. Okay, uh, how about, how about? y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun. Well, what's it called? Cups. - I don't know how to play Cups. - I'll teach ya! - Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun. - All right. Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have? A two and a five. Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars! - Really? ! - Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got? A four and a nine. You're kidding right? No. Why? Well that's a full cup! Damn! I am good at Cups! I'm not talking to her! Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her! Well, maybe you're right? She made fun of my phone pen! I know, I took it hard too. Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about? What are you doing? I'm unpacking! What? ! I'm not moving! Is that picture straight? It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left! Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave? - Because it's my apartment! - Well it's mine too! What else you got? ! How about, you're moving! Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you! Hey, how are you guys doing? Great! Monica's moving! I am not! Oh really? ! Then how come all your stuff is in this box? ! Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down. No Phoebe I am mad! Well, deep-deep-deep down! Yeah, I'm just mad! Then keep running. You win. Well, what did you have? It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far? Uh, wow, 700. Not 700 exactly? Yeah. Double it! What? Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get? No way! Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?" Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse. But umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore. What? ! You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you! Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving. Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. Oh really? Like what Monica? Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots... Oh yeah, good start Mon. She lets you borrow them. Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet. Do you wanna live outside? ! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like. What else? When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler... She was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! Oh, it's gonna be fine. Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun! But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler. Oh that's right. You're still set on that? Kinda. Oh my God! Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right? Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. Hey! What's wrong? Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break... I lost $1,500 to him in Cups! Wh-How did you lose at Cups? ! The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'! Oh man! And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups. All right, let's play one more hand! One more! No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a? I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know.. Thank you for being such a great roommate. I can't take the big white dog! You love it! It's him, not it! No, but wait? what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say. $1,500? Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again! When did I try to give you money? Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay. I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss is you. And now the dog. - Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay? - Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. - Oh! I have your key. Here you go. - Thanks. Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours. Bye house! Bye Mon. She really left. I know. Thank you. No problem roomie. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure! What the hell is that dog doing here? ! I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. - And now you want that money back. - Exactly. Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game! I made it up! I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square. At a fake game! Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups. Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last. No. Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time. Previously on ER... What time are you off? Now. You should all offer Dr. Corday your congratulations since most of you... will be working with her in her new position as associate chief of surgery. What's all this about, Robert? No "Thank you I'm honored"? No "I hope I don't dissapoint"? You still want to marry me? - Yes. - Ok. So, she's looking at surgery? Has to have a mastectomy, I'm affraid. What about Reece, eh? You ever think of that? I mean you want to take him away from his father? You may not even be his father. What? 6x03 "GREENE WITH ENVY" Hi. I'm here to see Dr. Weaver. - She went that way handing out badges. - Excuse me? "Creativity, accountability, respect, excellence." That's a lot to live up to. - He's looking for Dr. Weaver. - This way. - Help me. I'm dying here... - You'll be all right. Let's go. Sit here. - Lucy this guy has a little cut on his arm. - A cut? ! The bitch stabbed me! What'd she stab you with, sir? - Carving knife. Like I'm a damn steak or something! There goes the ulnar! You're killing me! Just breathe. I'm sorry. Sit down, please. Hold still. Don't be such a baby. We can't help you unless you stop. Look me in the eye. Hold still. - Are you a doctor? - Keep the pressure on. We'll use this to make a tourniquet. Get his arm out. Put your arm out. Come on around this side. - Pump it up to 180. - Keep breathing. Relax. - We got 180. - All right, take your hand off. Creativity. That's what's on your badge. Who are you? Sorry I'm late. You all right? Get me some curved Kellys and Vicryl, I'll be even better. Good to see you. Lucy, this is Dr. Gabriel Lawrence, our new Attending. How do you do? - Mark. - I know, I'm late. Meet Gabe Lawrence. This is Dr. Mark Greene. Dr. Lawrence, it's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Don't hold it against me. - Were you in an accident? - No, I started my shift a little early. - I'm sorry? - Gabe's from New Western... - ... as our new Attending. - As our new Attending. - We're incredibly lucky to have him. - Absolutely. We're gonna take the grand tour. Would you like to come with us? I've done the tour. I'm gonna get this. - What do you got, Doris? - A 28-year-old fell off his bike. I didn't fall. A cab cut me off. Passed out for two minutes. Small contusions to his Forehead. Vitals are stable. - Reece might not be yours? - That's what she said. - You think she lying? - I don't know. I wasn't with her 24 hours a day. Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man. - She's gonna use this against me, isn't she? - She can't. If Carla had any doubts she should've raised them at the petition... to determine parentage three months ago. She didn't, so it's moot. It's not a problem. You've put yourself through a hell of a lot for this. Maybe we should make sure he's yours? - Do a DNA test. - No. Peter, you hired me to protect your interests. If you want a way out, she gave you one. We'll have to intubate. Okay, on my count. One, two, three. Good. - What do we got? -16-year-old male. Single GSW to the left chest. I'm gonna put him in a chest tube. Can you intubate? I think I can manage. 15 of Etomidate, 100 of sux, number-eight ET tube. - Help. - You're gonna be okay. What's his name? Joshua Fox. That's his only I.D. he had. They'll put a tube down your throat to help you breathe. - Can you call his family? - Off a video card? It's all we've got. Thora-Seal's ready. Hook me up. What's this about a rescheduled surgery this afternoon? Got a cancellation, so I moved up a mastectomy. Oh, well, you can hold it back down. I've got an elective hernia. I'm sorry. I'm not going to torture a woman for another two weeks... just so some man can have his groin patched. Once again, male surgeons decide- Ok, I surrender. Hormones talking. You can have your surgery. I'm in. Bag him. Well, It doesn't seem to be much blood in here at all. I'll sew the tube in. An O silk. Good breath. Call ICU. - See if we can get him a bed? - Sure. Be right back. So, Dr. Cordey, the mastectomy coming in today, is it Elaine Nichols? - I thought that wasn't until- - I moved it forward. Sure that's the right thing to do? Isn't it kind of fast? - Why are you so interested? - She's a friend of the family. Really? Then I shouldn't be discussing it with you, should I? Make sure you get a chest film. Lucy, you finished assisting Dr. Carter. Good. I have something for you. The Chicago Gazette is sending over a reporter today. Mostly to do a puff piece on me. But they also want to take a look at the ER. Why are you telling me? Well, because you're going to show them around let him see what heroes we all are. How we save kiddies' lives. Etcetera. Blow my trumpet. - You do that better yourself. - Look at you. Look at me. - Who'd you rather spend and hour with? - You have a point. - Next time wear a helmet. - Come on, doc, Give me a break. How about a fractured skull? Want to be fed through a tube? Be my guest. Okay, I'll wear the helmet. Can I go now? Not yet. We need a head CT. What's that? My Core Values badge. Creativity, Accountability, Respect, Excellence. All that and beautiful too. You must be some kind of nurse. I am. - Why doesn't Dr. Grumpy have one? - Guess I'm out of the loop. It looks like you've got a broken arm, Loren. We're gonna need some x-rays. Any other sign of trauma? Contusion to the right shoulder, ecchymosis of the face and right hip... And slight wrist tenderness to the wrist. - How far did you fall, Loren? - I'm not sure. Can you tell me how you fell? Did you fall like this, or did you fall more on your hand? Yes. - What, on your hand? - I don't remember. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Don't worry. That's what we have x-rays for. So I'll get an AP, and a lateral of the forearm, as well as wrist and elbow films. Sure, we don't want to miss anything. It's busy. I know, Patient through-time... is longer than at New Western. But our census is bigger. OH, busy is good. Busy keeps you young. I'll just take a look at that fellow in Three. Look at that. How cute is that. Thanks, guys. - What's in here, it's so heavy? - Something to spice up your wedding night. Conni! You shouldn't have. Spice up mi wedding night? Sure! Nice hot gumbo to keep up his strength. Jenny, It's this your last shift for a while? Yep, catching a plane at 6:00 to New Orleans. Then in the morning, Reggie will make me an honest woman... and I'm going to show him the town. Show him a wild time in New Orleans, honey! I'm sure he'll be very happy. Didn't I give you a Core Values badge? - A toddler chewed it. - There you go. Always wear it. I will. I guess you can take it off on your wedding night. Now, open your eyes. Relax. What three things did I ask you to remember? - Dog, fire truck and Brigitte Bardot. - Excellent. Dates me, I know, but your first love is always your strongest. You must be Dr. Lawrence? John Carter, Senior Resident. As usual, I'm learning how to be a doctor from my patient. Meet Mr. Ulman. Minor head trauma, brief LOC. You tell me what reflex would indicate increased intracranial pressure. - A blown pupil? - Not a reflex. Observe. I scratch the thenar eminence. I look for ipsilateral contractions of the muscles of the chin muscles. I see none. Therefore I diagnose no significant head injury. It's called Radovici's sign. You can dress, my friend. I'll see about getting you discharged. - Thanks a lot, Doc! - My pleasure. Radovici's sign? Pretty cool. - Try it on your next head trauma. - I will. - Got that migraine in Four? - Yeah, sure. I'll tell you how I remember. Radovici sounds like radish. I pluck the radish with my thumb... Daycare said he cried all day, tugging on his ear. Temp's 101. Must be a load off having a daycare center here. - Does his mom work too? - Yeah. It must be tough on the both of you. Such a sweet kid. - How's his ear? - He's got a nasty looking otitis. - Is he allergic to any medication? - No. Ok. Some Tylenol for the pain, and let's put him on amoxicillin for 10 days. Did you have ear infections as a kid? No, why? Is just they often run in families. Yeah, well, you know, he probably got it in daycare. I mean, there is a Lot of sick kids up there. You wanna leave him here with me until his temperature goes down? Yeah, sure. I know. Come on, come on. All right. There you go. Has ICU found a bed for Joshua Fox yet? The gunshot wound kid in Trauma One. Well, call them again. - Have you seen my bicycle guy? - Isn't he still in courtain Three? Spandex-butt? Yeah, he was discharged by GL. - Who's GL? - Gabriel Lawrence. All right, the good-looking older guy. I just saw him going to the lounge with Dr. Corday. A Frenchman, Dr. René Laënnec... rather than press his ear to mademoiselle's magnificent breast... rolled-up a newspaper instead and used that to listen to her heart. Voilà, the first stethoscope! Voilà, the first sensitive male doctor in history! Dr. Green, you know who invented the stethoscope? I don't. Did you discharge my patient? I don't believe so. Mr. Ulman. Fell off his bike. I wasn't aware he's your patient. He was. I'd ordered a head CT which he obviously didn't get. Don't worry. I performed a thorough neurological exam. He didn't need a CT. The lost of consciousness... put him a risk factor of intracranial hemorrhage. Minuscule risk. I gave him a head-injury instructions sheet. If he has any warning signs, he'll come back. He lives alone. If he slips into a coma, no one knows. This isn't like New Western. County patients tend to be a little less reliable when it comes to follow-up. I'm aware of that, Dr. Green. That's why I told him to call me in four hours to tell me how he's doing. Difficult if he's passed out on the floor. What would you do? Without seeing the patient, I'd rather- No, I'd like to know. What would you do? Fell off his bike. Lost consciousness. You did a complete neuro exam? Yes, he was alert and oriented. Full balance, recall, normal reflexes. - How long was lost of consciousness? - Less than two minutes. - You visualized the fundi? - Discs were sharp. I think Dr. Greene was just being very thorough. Sounds like a "no" to me. Look at it this way. We just saved Mr. Ulman $800. - "A" for Accountability. - Right. Yeah but she really does meet all the requirements. I really couldn't agree with you more on this- - Can I talk to you? - You'll get back to me later, right? - As soon as I can. - What's up? What's up? Why you didn't tell me you were hiring Lawrence? I only found out that he was available two days ago. So, in two days you didn't have time for a five-minute conversation? Mark, look, I mean, the man's a legend. He's one of the founding fathers of emergency medicine. We're so lucky to have him. Couldn't you have the courtesy to at least tell me first? It's called respect, Kerry. Look, it's even on your stupid badge. Elaine. - Heard you were coming in today. - Did you? - I asked you to leave me alone. - Yeah, I know. I know that you did and I'm sorry. But I really need to talk to you. Because it's... Because I don't want you to have the wrong idea about me. I don't. I want you to know that I'm here for you. And that for me this wasn't just about- - Sex? - Yeah. - It wasn't about that. - It was for me. If we're talking needs, John, I don't need you to feel sorry or worried. Or tender or anything. I just need you to go away. I don't wanna go away. Loren Johnson's X-ray. Mid-shaft fracture of the radius. No injury to the wrist or elbow. She was lucky. - Maybe not. - What's this? Some more of Loren Johnson. I pulled her records. See these calluses? Healed rib fractures. And this, some kind of blunt trauma. Maybe a baseball bat. She wants to go home as soon as we splint her arm. You know, this is only her second visit here. But she has been to Mercy three times, McGaw twice, Ravenswood once. This time, I don't want her to go home. - Dr. Kovac? - Yes? Yes. Hi, I'm Loren's husband, Pauly. I just want to thank you for looking after her so well. Loren wasn't clear on how the accident exactly happened. Maybe that's because she's a little bit embarrassed about it, isn't that right, Loren? How did it happen? She was up a ladder in our bedroom hanging drapes and lost her footing. Asked her not to do it by herself, didn't I, honey? Yes, you did. Shall I splint her? - Mark, can I have a word-? - Lizzy, Paula Trancoso, Chicago Gazette. Elizabeth Corday, My associate Head of Surgery. And Mark Greene, one or our ER docs. You' re wearing scrubs. Yes, it was my idea. I wanted to blend in. Elizabeth was gonna show Paula around the ER. You don't mind, Mark? If you feel Dr. Corday has the time... Had I known that the Gazette was gonna send you, my dear, I would have made time in my schedule. But as it is, I'll have to leave you to the tender mercies of Dr. Corday. Well, this is the ER, obviously. - This is Josh's cousin. - Great. Josh. Josh, your cousin's here. How's he doing? He looks a lot worse than he is. His lung collapsed so we put a tube in his chest. You can talk to him if you want. - He's taching at 140. - Josh, are you in pain? - BP 180 over 120. - Call Benton. - Maybe he's hemorrhaging. Let's spin the crit. - His pulse is up to 160. You'll have to wait outside. Wait outside, please. Go outside. Come on. What is it? Does the chest tube hurt you? - What have we got? - He's tachy at 160. - What's his crit? - Drawing it. You having trouble breathing? You were shot. Yes, we know. My God! He's the shooter. I'll call Security. - Hey, hold it right there! - He's got a gun! Drop it! Get down! - We need a gurney over here. - Looks like an abdominal wound. - Get a backboard, over here! - Strong carotid pulse. - His chest's clear. His name? - McGinnis. Joe McGinnis. - Need help? - We're fine. I want two lines NG and a Foley. Roll him gently. Gently. On my count. One, two, three, lift. CBC, coag, type and cross for four. Call O.R. BP's 130 over 80. Pulse is 96. No visible GSWs to chest or abdomen. Let's roll him. See anything back there? Any blood? - Nothing on the back. - All right, check the extremities. - Where's the blood from? - Looks like he cut his hand. - Did he even get shot? - No, he fainted. - Is this the guy who got shot? You need me? - Yes, his hand needs suturing. Suturing? That's it? I want every piece of equipment checked for damage. I don't want anybody seizing because their IVs are punctured. - Nineteen patients all accounted for. - Nobody's hurt? Nothing serious, apart from the guard. Two flesh wounds from ricochets. Some glass cuts and contusions from diving to the floor. That's all. That's all? There must've been about 20 bullets flying around. Guess we got lucky. MVA, SUV versus truck. 38-year-old male driver... broke his nose when the airbag inflated. - My wife and child were- - They are just behind you. Wife has a few minor scrapes, little boy is Ok. Why the cops? What's going on here? Curtain Three! - What do we got? - Boy's named David. He's nine. Slightly tachy 110. BP's 115 over 83. Chest pain. One, two, three! Hi, David, I'm Cleo. Do you know what happened to you? We were in an accident. This truck just hit us. Son of a bitch came right through the red. Look, I know my nose is broken. Why are you fiddling with my face for? Just checking to see if anything else is broken, Mr. Bradley. If David's okay, we don't have to stay do we? Lungs clear bilaterally. Still tachycardic. We called our doctor from the ambulance. He said they should take us to Ambrose. But the paramedics said you were closest. They are allowed to do that, the paramedics. Can they go against the patients' wishes? Get a crit, UA, C-spine and chest film. Until I do these tests, David's not going anywhere. Elaine? - Is everything all right? - Everything is fine. I just think maybe this has been too fast for me. So, I wanna go home and think about it. You know, I could use some fresh air myself. Why don't we take a walk? - Want to say goodbye to anybody else? - I've been doing that all day. You didn't think you were to sneak out on us, did you girl? Beautiful. How will I get it on the plane? Leave Reggie behind and put them on his seat. - Thank you. - Take care. - See you. - Thanks. Jeany I need to see you in here and you too, Reggie. - But my shift is over - I know. - We have a plane to catch. - I know. Come on. Carlos! What's going on? Ask Adele. She really put herself on the line for this. We're gonna let you take Carlos. Really? On a temporary basis. And once you get yourself approved as a foster parent then we can consider something more official and permanent. Thank you. You're welcome. I guess we're not going to New Orleans. We can still get married here in Chicago. We could try the courthouse. When? Today. - Dr. Lawrence. - Dr. Greene. I've got her. Next time, could you sign up on the board? Paperwork! You can run, but you can't hide. - She's really hurting this time. - You been sick with fever, Cristal? Vomiting a little? No. Just hurting. She's had a sickle crisis before? The same as last month. We're gonna get you something for the pain, and then we're gonna run some tests. 80 of Demerol, 40 of Phenergan, CBC, chem panel and a UA, please. - Is that the sickle-cell girl? - Yeah. Could you add a retic count and a Beta HCG? You got it. Can we go now, doctor, before another gang band start sooting out the place? - I need to talk to you first. - Sure, what about? It's just some forms to fill out. Please. Something wrong? I have to inform you Mr. Johnshon that I believe you're mentally ill. What? ! - Because of your illness you can reasonably- - You're the one who's ill! What the hell do you think-? Okay, I get it. I'm in the nuthouse, huh? "Due to your illness, you can reasonably be expected... to inflict serious physical harm on yourself or on others. Therefore you're subject to involuntary admision... and are in need of immediate hospitalization." Wait till my lawyer gets ahold of you. You have no criteria to hold him. Her x-rays are my criteria. If she won't press charges, they mean nothing. He's gonna get up to Psych, and they'll send him right back down and he'll go home. I don't care about him. I care about her. We can do nothing or we can do something. This way she has a chance. I can't really... run away. Can I? You can delay, but not for long. Elaine, if you are worried about reconstruction, I can make an appointment with a plastic surgeon, and you can just- What will happen to it? After you cut it off? - Now you're being morbid. - Why? It's a part of me. It'll go to Pathology and then it'll be got rid of. Thrown in the trash. Just medical waste. I'll have a blob of gel instead. What will it feel like when I touch it? When somebody else touches it? Elaine, lots of women have this type of surgery. I can't imagine feeling anything. And If I can't, how will anybody else? How can I be with anybody again? - You can't let this define you. - It's hard not to. I was happy with who I was. That's exactly who you'll still be. I'd better come back in. I may be vain, but I'm not stupid. - Can you do something for me? - Of course. When you cut, you cut everything. Don't leave anything. Cut it all. You know the only good thing about sickle cell gene? - There isn't anything good. - No, no, there is. You know, there is a disease called malaria... that kills almost a million children a year. What do you think protects people against malaria? The sickle-cell gene. That isn't a bad thing, is it? - Thank you. - My pleasure. She should drink lots of liquids and bring her right back if she has more pain. - Sure. Say thank you, Cristal. - Thank you. You're welcome. You can get dressed and go home now. Over here. Over here. Thank you. - The labs come back yet? - No, not yet. Let me know if they do. Dr. Kovac. Carl De Raad, Psychiatry. Your psychiatric hold: way out of line, my friend. Why? Because to justify certification a patient has to be a danger to himself or others. He is a danger to others. Come on, just look at his wife. She said she fell off a ladder. Until she says different, nothing we can do. I'm sorry. - Have you talked to him? - I've seen him. Dr Kovac, I know why you did it. But I'm not even gonna take him upstairs for evaluation. I'm going to release him. Can you do me a favor? Can you talk to him at least? - What's the point? - Please. You and me, let's talk to him. The crazy foreigner. They should put these on you, you know? Why? I'm not going to hit your wife. I never hurt my wife. Never. Mr. Johnson, settle down. We just want to talk to you. Well talk to her. Go ahead, ask her. Have I ever hurt you? No! Will you let him go, please? - You want us to release him? - Please. OK. Let him go. How long before you hit her again? On the way home? Or maybe wait till you get drunk? Have a bad day at work? - What are you doing? - One thing I don't understand. The X-rays show your wife had three cracked ribs. Here: - How'd it happen? - Leave it, Kovac. She fell off a ladder again? Or what? Was it down the stairs, maybe- Can you shut this guy up? - Did you just kick her? - That's enough. To break her ribs... you'd have to stamp on her chest. What a man! Shut up! Go on, then. Screw you. - I'll kill him! - No! I'll kill him! - Calm down, Mr. Johnson! - Get off of me! I'm gonna kill him! - See? Danger to others. - Get out of here! See? All right. Mark, Beta HCG on the sickler. - Where are they? - They walked out a couple of minutes ago. Lawrence, we got a problem here. Mr. Powell? - We need you to come back into the hospital. - But we just left. Your daughter needs another test. But we've seen the doctor. Cristal is feeling much better. - What is it? - She needs to come back. - Excuse me? - The ICON is positive. She has to come right back in. Now. Dr. Finch, Sam Jacobs. I just want to thank you for looking after one of my favorite families so very well. We haven't quite finished the tests. I've made arrangements for David to be transfered to Ambrose. If you'd be so kind as to sign him. I'm not happy about moving him. I've looked it. His C-spine's clear. An ambulance is waiting. He complained of back pain at the scene. I'm still waiting on a second crit. When you get that, fax it over to me. It'll be a half an hour, that's all. In half an hour, Dr. Finch, he'll be under observation at Ambrose, not taking up precious space here. We ready to roll, Sam? Are we, Dr. Finch? - There's the ovary. - It looks pretty normal. - What are you looking for? - There. Mass in the fallopian tube. - What is it? - Fetal pole and heartbeat. - What did he say? - There's a heartbeat. - What are you saying? - There's a heartbeat. - Your daughter's pregnant. - No, she's 12 years old! - There's got to be a mistake. - There's no mistake. She's pregnant. The fetus is in the fallopian tube, not the uterus. - I want a second opinion. - I'm the second opinion. We're lucky we caught this early enough. Your daughter needs surgery now. If it ruptures, it could be very dangerous. I'm gonna call the O.R. - Were you checking up on me? - Just watching out for the patients. Will there be video games? Sure. Video games, TV, your own room. Just like a hotel. What's your favorite game? David? David? David, can you hear me? Stop! What? Why are we stopping? - He's tacky. Get a BP. - I can't get a pressure. No pulse on the left. Go to trauma. - I don't want him staying here. - He has to. - Need a hand? - Eight years old. Name is David, in rapid deceleration. MVA, crashed while being transferred to Ambrose. Probable a traumatic rupture at the junction of the subclavian and aortic arch. - Why was he being transfered? - All right, we' re going to have to crack him. - Sorry. Sorry. - Thoracotomy tray. Where is Kerry? She said she'd be here. - You know this place closes at 5? - Yeah, we know. - Do we really need two? - Two witnesses, yes. Right, suction. Start a round with the packed cells. - He's in V-tach. -60 of lidocaine. - Son of a bitch. I can't find the source. - He's still in V-tach. Stand by with the paddles. I've never done one like this before. - Why don't you talk me through it? - Keep suctioning. You have to- Connie, would you get that woman out of here! Ma'am, you have to leave. - Peter, need any help? - Please, Mark, get that woman out of here. - Get your hands off me. - Out! Gonna clamp distally to the left subclavian. Open the pleura to identify the area that's leaking. Release the clamp distally to identify the leak. - I see it. - Now evacuate the hematoma. Put a curved Potts underneath the leak to leave the aorta patent. Now clamp above the tear. There you go, Carter, You just isolated the leak. Nice work, Carter. Do you Reginald Moore take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife... to live together in the state of matrimony... to love her, honor and keep her through sickness and prosperity... whatever your future might be? I do. - I think he needs a feeding. - Okay. Just one second. Sorry. Hi. Are you hungry? It's okay. Go on. And do you Jeanie Boulay take this man as your lawful wedded husband... to live together in the state of matrimony... to love, honor and keep him through sickness and prosperity... whatever your future might be? I do! No, it's not unusual. This is a teaching hospital and Residents are here to learn. So they are allowed to practice on patients. How else do they learn? A little tough on whoever they learn on, isn't it? The residents are carefully supervised. What I saw wasn't carefully supervised. Well, I'm sure you've seen enough, didn't you? . It was really really nice to meet you. And I do look forward to reading your article. Mark, thank God I got rid of her. Yeah, careful she doesn't turn up somewhere else disguised as a surgeon. - Did she get in the way in Trauma? - Yeah. - Mark, I didn't ask to be her tour guide. - Well, you didn't say no. - How's it going? - Fine. Heard about your Psych hold. Yeah, I'm very popular with Psychiatry. They took him upstairs for assessment. Maybe they'll hold him. I don't think so. I provoked him, in front of witnesses. Maybe now she'll see how he's really like, you know. You don't think she knows? Yeah, I know, it's hopeless. Maybe not. She didn't go upstairs with him. Lucy took her to the cafeteria. Fingers crossed. David's stabilized. He's in surgery. Barring any complications, he'll be okay. If you want to go and see him the nurse will take you. - Thank you. - Thank you, doctor. Dr. Finch. You did well to catch that. If we'd waited for the tests, we'd would have seen this. We could've operated in a controlled manner rather than having to rip an 8- year-old's chest open. - We had no choice. - I did. I shouldn't have let myself listen to you. - How are you feeling? - Okay. It went well. There was no evidence the cancer had spread. But we will have to wait for the pathology reports on the lymph nodes. I got a plastic surgeon in to close, so we could minimize scarring. And of course within the next couple of weeks we can begin reconstruction. When can I go home? Well, we had to put in some drains to collect any accumulating fluid. Like I'm a sewer system. Most likely it'll just be for the night. So you'll be able to go home tomorrow. Now, I've given the nurse all my numbers. So if you need anything, you have any questions, just call... anytime. Thanks. Oh, Dr. Kovak, now that Dr. Lawrence is here... I don't believe that we're gonna be needing you anymore, ok? . Okay. - Hey, are you on tonight? - No, I'm not. - How much fluid did you give him? - Two liters wide open. - What do we got? - Seventeen-year-old, 3 gunshot wounds... to the right chest. One to the left. BP 90 over 60, pulse 120. Intubated in the field. - He needs a bilateral chest tube. - One for you and one for me. Malucci, you do a central line. On my count. One, two, three. - Two chest tubes and a central line. - Only got one chest tray. - Get another. - We'll share. 10-blade. - BP's 80. Pulse ox 92. - Curved Kelly. - Twenty cc's for the lab. - O-neg is here. Chest tube. Get this damn thing out of my way! Somebody grab this badge and flip it. - Stitch, please. - I'm in. Lock and load the infuser. - BP's down to 70. -100 cc's on the right. - We got bleeding on your side, Dr. Greene. - Ok, where's Benton? He got off at 6. We need a surgeon down here now! Give me the Foley. Come on! 30 cc syringe for Dr. Greene. - What are you doing? - Check the balloon. - What are you doing? - Check the balloon. Come on. If we can't put pressure on the bleeder from the outside, we do it on the inside. Pressure's down to 60. All right, tell me when. 20 cc's. There's 30 cc's. - Chest tube output's down to a trickle. - Pressure's up to 80. Old army trick to tamponade the subclavian. - Cool. - Very cool. Let's get him up to the O.R. Dr. Carter? - How is she? - She's resting comfortably. You can go in if you like. - Hey, Luka. - Hey. - Want a lift? - In that? It's my mom's. I had to pick up some stuff from work. - What, baby stuff? - Yeah. Okay. - Here we are. - Yeah. Let's see... - Let's get him this. - He's 9 months old. You're never too early to start. Carlos, do you think your daddy's silly? What about this? You like one of these? "Pull over. Pull over." He is silly. Elizabeth, I wanted to apologize for being abrupt. - You mean rude. - Yes. I'll think about it. You could apologize actually for that crap at the head CT. What? ! No way on earth will I apologize for that. You put me on the spot. Yeah, but I expected you to give the right answer. The right answer? That Lawrence is still bugging you, isn't he? Just because he can diagnose something... without having to order every test in the book. He may have some fancy moves in Trauma... but he doesn't know how to function in an inner-city ER. - You're afraid you might learn something? - He's too slow, he spends hours with every patient, and then he ties up the residents chattering on about the Radovici sign. - The what? - You don't know about that? - No, what is it? - I don't think I should tell you. Mark. Just one more. Come on, Reece, please. Okay. Maybe not. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? Jackie, you think he looks like me? I hope not. He's got enough problems. Hey, when I was a kid, did I have a lot of ear infections? I don't know, Peter. I was your sister, not your mother. You were a scrawny little thing. Always coming down with something. No wonder you got into medicine. Thanks. I'll take him up to bed. - Do the washing up. - All right. Dry up too. Don't leave everything just sitting on the side. I love you. Do you love me? Get out of here. Come on, my baby. - You live here? - I told you it's in the water. - Yeah, but I mean, is it sanitary? - Sure. - What do you do in winter? - In winter I go south. Like the birds. - Thank you for the lift. - Sure. See you. Sure. You scratch the thenar eminence... causing ipsilateral contractions of the chin muscles. Definitely contracting. - Is that a good thing? - Sadly, no. It indicates increased intracranial pressure. Disturbances of the brain. Which explains why you're working with Romano.

Even after my cyber squandering.... we've still got $1 ,200. - All right, dorks, this is a holdup. - [ Gasping, Murmuring ] Oh, yes! Download to papa. - [ Beeping ] - Yoink dot adios, back-slash losers. - [ Groans ] - [ Marge ] We were robbed? You seem to know an awful lot about this for an innocent person. We were saving that money for our family vacation. Now we're gonna have to start all over again. - [ Groans ] - Aw, don't worry, sweetheart. I'll get us the money- even if I have to get a second job. Evenin', neighbor. Low on funds again? - Yes, sir. - Now, Homer, we can't have you burglarizing us... every time you got a bill to pay. I know, sir. I'm sorry, sir. It's just that you and Maude live like royalty in your fancy castle... while I got Marge trapped over there like a pig in a mud beehive. Oh, we're-We're not as well off as you think. We give to eight different churches just to hedge our bets... and the Leftorium's business has gone way down hill... since Leftopolis moved in next door. If you're not rich, then how come you have a new refrigerator... an electric can opener, a milk shake machine? [ Chuckling ] We picked those up cheap. - They were evidence at a murder trial. - Sweet. We got that tip at the Chuck Garabedian Mega-Savings Seminar. - Go on. - He taught us how to live... a Burt Reynolds lifestyle on a Mac Davis income. We've already got tickets for his next seminar. I think you'll find living thrifty a lot more satisfying than stealing. Maybe you're right, Ned. Maybe you're right. Are you tired of missing out on the good things in life- Family vacations,jet packs, Solid Gold Dancers? There's only three left in the world. Well, stick around, 'cause I'm gonna tell you... the 1 2 savings secrets Wall Street won't tell you. Then I'll show you the three ways to get back to the highway- including one shortcut those Wall Street fat cats don't want you to know. - [ Cheering ] - Oh, here we go with the fat-cat bashing. Well, what do you expect? These yokels are pure Baltic Avenue. [ Chuckles ] Uh-oh! I'm late for the Short Line Railroad. [ Tires Squeal ] Let's start with mega secret number one: "Ya gotta squeeze every penny." You see this tux? I got it cheap 'cause Roy Cohn died in it. - [ Murmuring ] - That fancy yacht? A bargain, 'cause it smells like cat pee. - [ Murmuring ] - And those beautiful women? - They used to be men. - [ Groaning ] The point is, ya gotta squeeze every penny. Come on, let me hear you. [ Together] Squeeze every penny. Squeeze every penny. I'm squeezing. I'm squeezing it. - [ Slurping Sound ] - Hey, I squeezed so hard it went into my hand. Oh, Homer, not again. Ew. We're gonna do our grocery shopping at a 99-cent store? Well, maybe for your wedding. - [ Bart ] How about here? - Not if we want that vacation. Look, Mom. They have your dress. [ Groans ] Thirty-three cents? I paid almost double that. Blue? Wow! This plankton's only 33 cents. According to the Mexican Council of Food... this expired two years ago. Sure, by their standards, but we live in America. [ Chomping, Groaning ] This also says it can cause red tide poisoning. But it's so cheap. Well, let's see what's in the old vacation fund. Homer, you could have just unscrewed the bottom. A little late for "could-haves," Marge. I don't think there's enough here for a vacation. There is for a Mega-Savings vacation. Chuck Garabedian says you can fly mega cheap... if you don't care where you go. That's right.Just go to the airport and wait for some no-shows. Then you can buy their seats for a fraction of the price. Are you going through our garbage? That's right. You fat cats didn't finish your plankton. Now it's mine. Hawaii, here we come. No. No. We're going to Paris. I can feel it. Come on, Transylvania. [ With Jamaican Accent ] No, mon, let's go home toJamaica. I and I been in Babylon too long. [ Woman On P.A.] Attention. Flight 605 to Tokyo is ready for departure... and has four available mega-saver seats. - [ Both ] Yeah! - Come on, Homer.Japan. No, notJapan,Jamaica. I wanna pass the dutchie on the left-hand side. Never mind. Looks like the Flanders are gonna get those seats anyway. Oh, so Flanders thinks he can steal our vacation, huh? - [ Groans ] - Come on! - Whoo! - [ Horn Honking ] - Sayonara, suckers. - [ Snarls ] Yea! The Simpsons are going toJapan. [ Gong Sounds ] Hey, watch the gong,jerk. Come on, Homer. Japan will be fun. - You liked Rashomon. - That's not how I remember it. Besides, if we wanna see Japanese people... - we could have gone to the zoo. - Homer! What? The guy who washes the elephants is Japanese. His name is Takashi. He's in my book club. Look, Mom. The safety instructions are written in haiku. "Fasten seat belts tight. "Your seat cushions float gently. Headsets, five dollars." [ Beeping ] Sir, it is not safe to use electronic devices yet. - You're the waitress. - [ Beeps ] [ Attendant ] Turn it back on.! Turn it back on.! Ooh. I never knew Jim Belushi made so many movies. Yeah, isn't it amazing? They're filming one right now in the bathroom. Gonna be on towards the end of the flight. Toga! Toga! Toga 2,000! Marge, they stole my idea. The local time is... tomorrow. [ Homer] Here's our room. Homer, you're supposed to slide those doors open. I don't have time for that. [ Grunts ] [ Man's Voice ] Welcome. I am honored to accept your waste. - [ Beeps ] - ## [ Bells ] [ Gasps ] They're years ahead of us. Mom! Lise! Check it out. Dad's on TV. - Oh, yeah! - [ Marge, Bart, Lisa Screaming ] [ Gasps ] It's breathtaking. Look. There's the Imperial Gardens. The Meiji Shrine. The Hello Kitty factory. [ Cats Yowling ] [ Yowling Stops ] Who's up for some exploring? - Hey, I'm still checking outJapanese TV. - ## [ Synthesizers ] Isn't this that cartoon that causes seizures? [ Beeping ] [ Grunting, Groaning ] Bart, what are you doing? [ Grunting, Groaning ] Hey, what the- [ Grunting, Groaning ] Hmm. All right. Where you coming from? Southeast. Business or pleasure? Business. What are you hauling? Just cargo. Nothing... Nothing, really. You look beat. Did you drive straight through? Yep. Now why would you have to go through all that if you're hauling a bunch of nothing? I just need a room. What do you think I'd find if I opened up the back of that truck? (DROPS PEN) I don't know what you're getting at. I think you do. Let's say we go have a look. Let's say we don't, and you mind your own business. Why don't you get that truck off my property, right now. What is it with you people? (DOOR CLOSES) Come on. Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go. Walk. Walk. GARO: CJ. Gentle, por favor. Yeah. Sí? Amiga, what is your name? Antonia. Antonia. It is no surprise, huh? It means beautiful, um, praiseworthy and priceless, sí? You two girls have boyfriends? You have a boyfriend? Nada? Nada? But have you ever had boyfriend, or no? Sí. CJ? CJ: Yeah? Okay. This is why we are very gentle with them, and not moving around like they are dogs or animals because, uh... They have something very valuable, okay? Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking. I beg your pardon, my bad. GARO: Okay, let's go. I'll show you your room. We go this way. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (JAMES SIGHS) Shouldn't you be headed back out? Just trying to have a drink, man. Yeah, that always helps. How did you know? Box truck on an overnight delivery? Hauling cargo. I would've called the cops if they'd do a darn thing. I just needed the cash. I didn't know. And... And it seemed like an easy gig. You looking for sympathy? Not here. I need help. What's that? I need help. Her and her sister. I want to undo it, somehow. Look, you obviously know something about this. Then help me. (MAN SIGHS) Help her. I'm Dale. James. You still looking for a place to stay? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Don't be shy. You look good. And these will help you feel good. Go on, take one. No, thank you. How's your sister holding up? I don't know. This is too much for her. It's too much for... Anyone? Yeah, I remember being there. Did your family owe somebody moneys too? (SCOFFS) No. No, I'm just a regular idiot. I got boyfriended. You know? I met a boy online, blah, blah, blah. So one day, um, he sends me a plane ticket to meet him in Vegas. That first day was amazing. But that night... I guess he drugged me. Um, I woke up in the back of a van with a bunch of men. I am so sorry. It is what it is, you know. And Garo treats me way better than my old man ever did, so... I will pray for you. Honey, you got a rough couple of days coming up, you should pray for yourself. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey. Morning. Morning. To be honest, I'm surprised you're still here. I figured you would've sobered up and run home by now. A little surprised myself. Let's take a walk. First things first, I need you to get rid of that truck. What do you want me to do with it? I don't care. Just get it off my lot. If you need to go somewhere, I got some bikes out back. You can borrow one. Do you ride? It's been a while, but, yeah. Good. So what's your plan? Go to the motel, see what I can see. (CELL PHONE RINGING) (LINE RINGING) DALE: You all right? I have one person in this world that I actually mean something to. She's already lost her mom. And right now, she's at home wondering if her dad is gonna show up like he promised. And I'm I think it's Thursday. Or Friday. "Hi, it's Bjørn at Zahl transport. I can't answer the phone right now." He has to pick up when we call him. I want to go home. Shall we paddle home, Håkon? - Is that how it's looking? -Yes, he didn't answer. Lately a lot of snow had melted. Way too much snow. We had food for only two more days. Normally it only takes a day to the north end, where we kept our food. But that was on snow. This is the biggest pulk I'm ever going to have. The way it is right now. Never bigger. I had no idea how we'd get north without snow to pull the pulk. For all I knew, we might spend the rest of our time here carrying all our equipment. We weren't quite finished with our surfing. I believed the perfect wave was waiting for us in the north. Oh, snow! So appreciated. I hope there won't be many streams. We don't know. When we've been here before, it's been frozen and snowy. There might be many like this one. We were heading from the south of the island to the weather station. As the crow flies, that's 11 miles. One day passed. Two. I'm usually such an optimist. it can even make other people grumpy. But this didn't look very good. I'm craving chips. Yes, we are tired. We had to make several trips to carry all our gear. Every mile turned into seven miles. Three days. Soup made of nothing but stock tastes like crap. It's a dinner that fills your stomach, but not satisfactorily. - You're still hungry? -Yes. - I just feel that my body needs more. -Still hungry. Four days. Rocks, rocks, mud, mist, rocks. Bear Island is not just a playground. - This is just shit. What is... What's your top five? What do you miss the most from back home, right now? It's not something I miss because I've experienced it a lot, but... I imagine lying on my tummy in a tub adapted to that position of bathing. In very hot water, so that it almost burns a bit. And then being washed... Nicely and well, and rubbed on my back, especially on those hard to reach places. - Where you need to scratch... -Yes. And someone tousling my hair. We were halfway there, and there was not a strip of snow in front of us. But then we found the solution. We found one of the boats from the weather station. The dear dinghy. -It's not that big, though. -No, I wonder how we'll load it. I have the gun. So if anything goes wrong, I'll just have to shoot. - You'll just gun for it, right? -Yes. MS Mountain pulk is going on a trip. Right now we were to put the longest distance for four days behind us. And it's going to take half an hour. For the first time my childhood dream has come true and I can call myself captain Wegge. You're not a captain when you're fishing by the cabin. But when you have a lot of responsibility on a boat you are. That sounds good. Sounds good! Now all our gear is going across Haussvatnet. When we get there,- - I'll run ahead to the station and pick up enough food to stuff our faces with all the things we've craved lately. My stomach, which is growling and making trouble, will be satisfied. That will be nice. If I tip over in this damn icy water with all our gear, it'll be a hell of a story for the grandchildren. Apricots, nuts, waffles, kebab, hamburger... That'll be when we get home. Oil. A casserole made using oil and butter. And even more butter. I want it so badly! Ice, baby! Damn it! When I'm rowing, it's almost impossible to get the oars up again, through the layer of ice. In the middle of an icy hell. I can't row through the ice, and can't walk on it either. ...Trying to come up with a solution. The oar is starting to fall apart. Great! And while I fix it, the waves push me back into the ice. I'm trapped in a vicious circle. Damn it! Bloody, fucking hell! Damn it! Waves are pushing me back faster and faster the closer I get to the water. The worst thing is the oars getting stuck in the ice for every stroke. The time it takes to get them up is shorter than what the waves use to push me back. Looks like he's tried to row through the slush. The slush is getting thicker and thicker, and there's ice at the end. There might be a problem if Håkon starts doing something stupid. If he gets very tired, and something happens. If the boat takes in water, an oar breaks or... He gets really cold. Can you get out of there and further that way? Now we are starting to reach some limits. Maybe that's why we're on this trip, to test those limits. This is tragicomic. I can't help but laugh, that's how hungry I am. Well, now he's out. That's promising. I wonder whether if he's very annoyed or... I don't know. He's probably annoyed. You put up a good fight, Håkon. Håkon, can you just go and get the food? - If you're ready. -I am so ready. - I really can't wait. -Go for it. Get the food! Everything is a little wet, or damp. Our clothes and things. And the lavvo weighs a ton. Back in the days, when hungry, they made porridge from the lichen Umbilicaria. - Wow, that's a lot! -I'm going to make that. Moss is not really what I crave right now. I'd much prefer a waffle. Oh, the poor Wegge brothers. They have spent a day without food. Umbilicaria. That's kind of not... it doesn't sound good either. It sounds like belly button fluff. - This is delicious. -it's rather sticky. If I were really hungry, I would have eaten some more. - You are really hungry. -But Håkon will be here soon. Håkon, you can stay the night over there. No! - Tea. -Tea, and... When did these expire? Håkon is here! Håkon! Our hero! What did you bring us? Well, let's see what I have in my rucksack. Look, he's all red. He looks like Santa. He is like Santa! Håkon, Håkon! What have I got in my sack? Prunes. Yes! Food for my Diabetes? And some nuts, Santa had to taste some on the way. I want some too! I give me the camera, and you take the nuts? Santa needed some crispy fried onion too... After Håkon's boat trip, we were almost there. With one more day of carrying, we finally reached the island's north end. How idyllic is this? Here the possibilities for surfing were endless. The waves just had to get a little bit bigger. The Governor of Svalbard said the litter we collected would be picked up. So while waiting for waves, we cleared our last beach. But time started running out for our last surf. Yes. So you're in Longyearbyen now? So you'll reach Bear Island around Friday? All right. Thank you. All right. Take care. I think we're done soon. - With Bear Island? -No, with the drawing. It symbolizes... Nothing! Going home without a last surf on our dream beach felt rather sad. But then it actually happened. It's super clean, a little small. But it's building up. Bear Island, rock 'n' roll! - You got a good one there! -Yeah! A wave only comes along once. When I'm lucky enough to take part in what happens that one moment, and ride along with the power of the sea, time almost stands still. Dreams does not come true just by themselves. You have to make them real. We followed our dream. And it came true. 149.50 kroner. Awesome! It depends if you think of it as hourly wages. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the 2014 scoungbine here at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. I'm Rich Eisen. We've got a lot of potential first-rounders out there today, and then it looks like someone has seen Rudy one too many times. Kevin MacArthur, five foot eleven. Weight, 160 pounds, but that looks like it could be about 100 chicken parms ago. He's probably pushing a buck 80, and sources tell us ten pounds that could be back hair. KEVIN: Carlos Hyde, huh? Hey, man, we could be combine buddies. There's no buddies at the combine. Ha, Mike Evans. Hey, what say you draft me in your fantasy draft and I'll draft you in mine, huh? No, I don't think so. Why not, man? I'm a sleeper. Nobody sleeps that deep. I'm a little busy. What? Whoa! Oh, good thing you caught that. Ready... oh. Here's Mike Evans running the gauntlet, showing off the ball skills that should get him drafted in the top ten this year. Oh... ow. And then there's that. MacArthur, swatting at the ball like a baboon sitting on a hornet's nest. Oh! Ow. Aah! Now, it's hard to tell how his game will project to the NFL level, but one must assume that once the helmet goes on, he won't be able to catch as many balls with his face. God, one got me right in the taint. Some players come out too early... and some should never come out at all. There we go, here we go. (Kevin shrieks) Just pick... Just pick it up. I can't, I can't, I can't. You got to help me. (Kevin grunts, snorts) Oh! It's all right, Daddy's got you. That counts as one. He's a tweener for sure. Somewhere between mediocre and irrelevant. (Kevin shouts) Oh, God. All right. All right, switch it. No. No, no. Please don't do this. (Kevin squeaks) All right, okay. You got me that time. Let's run it again. What you got, little man? No- - Stephon Tuitt. Come on No, no, I don't want to. Pick up the pad, little man. I'm not doing it. Pick it up. I'm not doing it! Get back here. Oh, my God, he's so big! He's so big! Stop it! I'm told Kevin is also a lawyer, although from where I'm standing... (shrieks): No! ...his skill set doesn't appear to translate into any discernable position. No! No, don't do it, no! Here... or in the legal world. I'm dying here, Eisen. Why are you even here right now? Go home. You're terrible. Boo. ALL: Sacko, Sacko... Sacko. No. ...Sacko, Sacko, Sacko... And we have urine. That's a combine first. (whining): No... (Kevin exclaims) Oh. Oh, God, I had the worst dream. JENNY: Go back to bed, Sacko. Oh, my life is worse than my nightmare. Is the bed wet? Your champion wants to tell you all about the 2014 league draft plan. I am thinking an extravagant dinner. We are going to do one course per round. All on my dime. So put it down in your calendars- - August 23rd, okay? Oh, what's that- - I'm sorry, you don't have calendars? Oh, let me help you with that. Whoa. Oh! You made calendars? Calendars. RUXIN: That's a pretty hot move. ANDRE: Did you hire a professional photographer? I did. PETE: Looks like we finally found somebody to satisfy Jenny in the bedroom. Wh-What is this one? Why is October this picture? I don't want this picture out there. This is borderline Sacktual harassment. I disagree. I'd say this borders more on domestic Sacktual abuse. Oh, no, no, no, guys. There's absolutely no Sacktual abuse happening here. Ho, ho. You had coffee mugs up? Wow. Mm-hmm. To commemorate this wonderful moment, I have actually decided to officially change my team name. Really? I am no longer going to be Pete Top, Kevin Bottom. I am now gonna be Jenny Top, Kevin Bottom. That doesn't bother me-- that's my favorite position. Well, the other option was gonna be Andre 3,000 Dingers in His Face. Oh. (laughs) That's good, that's good. I like how you do thing where it sounds like a joke but there's no actual punch line. Anyway, can't waste time with you guys, I have to get to my office- - I have a little pre-op conversation with the mayor's wife. Ooh, what's she having done? Can't say, but let's just say it involves me going downtown. All right, later, losers. What the hell was that? I don't like successful, confident Andre. Yeah, it's as if he looked at us with complete disdain. I know that look. That's the look that I give you guys all the time. TACO: Hey, Sacko, can I borrow these? No. It's not your decision. You gonna play some golf? Yeah, love golf. It's such a great way to unwind after a long eight-hour work week. Where do you play golf? All or the place. You guys want to play? (BOTH): Sure. It's a dogleg right. It's 240 yards. (whistles) Oh, yeah, got all of that one. (whoops) Nice one, Taco. Street golf, not so bad. Yeah, you don't even have to worry about a tee time this way. Yeah, none of that country club attitude. As low-rent as this is, it does maintain the basic function of golf, which is to get away from your wife and children. Next hole? I'm happy with my long game, but my short game's in the shitter. You know, one thing I did notice is that, uh, you tend to take your eye off the ball at that very last second. Oh, really? Yeah, you could follow through on that and do a little better. Oh, okay, I'll work on that. Yeah, whoo! Birdie! Aw. Sliced it. Excuse us, playing through. Pardon us, sorry, guys. Excuse us. I might take a drop on this one. Trying to find my ball. Oh, it's in the rough. Folks, I'm just gonna play through real quick. Um... you want to go play the next hole? Yeah, we should go. Yeah. That one's on us, guys, thank you. Thank you. What are we gonna do about Andre? All of our beautifully timed, well-crafted insults are bouncing off him-- nothing is sticking to him. No, he's like Teflondre. Ugh, Teflondre sucks. Mm-hmm. I feel like it's my job as the Sacko commissioner to take that guy down a notch. What about Kevin? Aren't we gonna do more Sacko punishments? No, Jenny's doing a better job than all of us could. An24-7. Mmm. You like me on top? Mm-hmm, I do, it's my favorite. See- - Jenny Top, Kevin Bottom, not so bad. No, no, don't say it like that. No? No. Do you want me to tickle your Sacko? No. Ye... No, no, just... Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop. What? Oh... Look, look, okay... You can't belittle the Sacko all day long and then expect my sack to work at night. Okay, tonight let's maybe try a little role reversal. You be the champ. Okay. (soft chuckle) 'Cause I am your sweet, submissive... Sacko. No! No, don't say that. Don't say what? The "S" word, don't... Shiva or Sacko? Oh, either. Come on. What? This is domestic Sacktual abuse. Well, what am I supposed to do-- stop being so goddamn good? I'm never gonna get any. All right, another mock draft done. Ruxin is looking good, getting ready for the real draft. Ooh, it's gonna be a fun season. What's this now? Guess I must have joined a league by accident. Here, cancel. Hey, wait, what is this, now? Another league wants a trade? No. No, no, no, no. Romo... What-What, wait... No, no, I don't want to make a trade with you, so stop calling me. Good-bye. What is going on with you? Who are you trading with? I... I went to do some mock drafts, and instead of taking me to my team page, the stupid site took me to one of these randomized league-creating team pages, and now I'm in some leagues with some total stranger idiots. How many leagues are you in? I'm in 12 leagues. You did 12 mock drafts? Yeah, I was doing them reps, getting ready for the real thing. So if you're in 12 leagues, let me ask you this: are you cool in any of them? Oh! Oh! From downtown. Yeah. Nice one, Andre. I never realized that being in a league with strangers would actually be worse than a league with people I truly hate. I get it. I've been trying to jump out of this Dumpster fire forever. Well, look who it is-- the full buffet of sadness. Hello, Ted. Ladies. Jenny. I don't have a lot of time. You see that building behind me? That's city hall. You look very handsome, Ted. Correct. I am on my way to an AIDS Foundation charity event. Little bit of context I have for you is... I'm receiving an award. It wouldn't be the Shiva, though, would it? Because the Shiva is sitting right here. By the way, Jenny, if you need help throwing your extravaganza, I can get you a list of high-end chefs that'll... Oh, oh, call me. No, no, no, no, no. We don't need any help. Thank you, Ted. I would love that, thank you. All right, just relax over there, Sacko. I've called us all here today because this league needs some changes. What I'm proposing is we add two new members. We become a ten-team league. That's interesting. No, we're and eight-team league-- we always have been, we always will be. I could leave. No, Taco, you need to stay, because Kevin needs someone he thinks he can beat. (all laugh) Where is this coming from? Sounds to me like Kevin is the new Andre. Am I hearing this correctly? Oh. No, he's not. He's kind of right. Kevin is the new Andre. Ha, ha. I'm same old Kev. If the hat fits... oh! Oh! Hey! Yes. (laughs) Hey there, new Dre, the only thing worse than AIDS is Dre. (tires screech) Oh! Whoa. Is he okay? Oh, my God, he's not moving. Oh, my God, he's dead! He's dead. And his last words were, "Kevin is the new Andre." Well, at least he died doing what he loved-- making fun of you, Kevin. Ugh, these guys are trolling me now. Just turn your phone off, Ruxin. Gonna check out the snack table. Oh, you know what, Andre, you should take that hat off. Oh, out of a sign of respect? No, 'cause it's so terrible. Whoa, whoa, this is not the time. (sighs) Teflondre, man. Hi. Hi. Oh, Kevin, Jenny, so good to see you, thank you for coming. I am so sorry for your loss. I can't believe Ted is gone. Yeah, the way, it's so unexpected. Who would have thought Ted would have died of AIDS... charity. AIDS charity. I mean, this trade is just garbage. That... we would lose Ted and all those, you know, pervert arsonists run free. Thank you all for coming. So the funeral will be tomorrow? Yes. Mm-hmm, and after the funeral, the family will be sitting shiva. Yes. I'm sorry? What... What'd you say? The family will be sitting shiva. Shiva. Shiva You mean... You mean Shiva, right? Shiva. Shiva. Shiva. How is it spelled? S-H-I-V-A. Shiva. Shiva. And tonight, it-it's a Jewish custom that Ted's body cannot be left alone, so we will need watchers-- shomers. I understand. I was Jewish for a brief time last year. Listen, we'd be happy to come back tonight and, uh, be shomers so we could just see Ted one last time. That would be lovely. He would love that. Wow, Ted's really dead. He looks so peaceful. Why is that the desired adjective for a dead person? Like, if I go down, I people to be, like, "That dude looks like he's getting shit done, like he's getting laid and he's getting paid." Okay, Ted... are you ready... to draft? (whoops) Yes. Let's do this. Oh, I'm sorry. Did someone ask for a draft board? All right. Beer, anyone? Yeah, yeah. Nice, Taco. Here you go. One last draft with Ted. He would have wanted it this way. Yeah. We'll find someone to replace him in the league, but for now we'll just take turns drafting for him. We are no longer sitting shiva. We are now sitting Shiva (whoops) Gentlemen, I present to you our 2014 draft board. All right. That's awesome. Wait, wait, wait, wait, one more-- woop. That's an awful picture, babe. Why is my mouth open? Well, empirical evidence would point to you wanting to gargle Pete's pudding, but I think, in this case, just looking for wins. Oh. Can we please start the draft? The first pick- - Ted selects Jamaal Charles. Okay. Oh. Cold. (phone chimes) No. No, it's not a trade. You're on the clock. I know. I'm on the six different leagues right now, okay? I'm gonna take Julia Jones. It's got to be tough being a woman in the NFL. Beast Mode! Ted selects the Jacksonville Jaguars defense for the third period. No, no, no. Ruxin, have a little respect for the dead, please. Give him Gary and Foster. Le'Veon Bell. I don't even know which league you're talking about. Let's get some LeGarrette "Blounts" up in here. Let's get messed up. Taco, you can't get high off a running back. Cheers, Ted. Funeral draft! You know what's amazing is, some people would find this disrespectful. (Taco sputters) Ruxin, you're up on the clock. I'm not in the Marines, so I don't know what that lingo means. Cameron Jordan, okay? Cameron Jordan? Yeah, Cameron Jordan. I think he said "Cameron Jordan." Cameron Jordan? He wants Cameron Jordan. Okay. Cameron Jordan? Cameron Jordan. Right. Defensive end, New Orleans Saints. Congratulations, Ruxin. Wha Good pick. No, no. Jordan Cameron, the tight end for the Cleveland Browns. No, that's-that's not what you said, right? Not what I heard. I heard him say "Cameron." Ted? Ted? Did he say "Cameron Jordan"? Cameron Jordan, Jordan Cameron-- it's the same thing. No, it's not. One of them's black, and one of them's white. And one of them plays defense, and one of them plays offense. This is not my fault, okay? I'm in too many leagues right now. Such an idiot. I'll take Chad Ochocinco of the Montreal Alouettes. Boom! Great choice. And in round 11, Russell Wilson. Go, Hawks. (Taco inhales) Oh, yeah. All right, hit it, Ted. There you go. (knocking on door) Hello? His parents are here. Oh. What? Oh, my God. Uh. (overlapping chatter) Um... Hold on. Uh, we were just mourning. Hello? ! Come on. Mmm. Can the shomers come to the door, please? ! Uh, coming. One second. Okay. I am so, so... Very. ...so, so sorry. Shalom. Shalom. Shalom. Shalom. Shalom. We got a lot of noise complaints. Did you hear anything? No. No. No. Well, I'm glad you're still here because we went through Ted's will. Ted insisted in his will that you replace him before the season starts. Oh. And he bequeathed one of you his Laguna beach houses. Which one of us? Whoever wins the fantasy football league this year. Oh. Oh, wow. I can't believe we're playing for a house. I know. It's right on the ocean. Guys, it's amazing. Yeah, we've got stakes to play for. This is huge. Oh, man. Whatever. You don't want a Laguna beach house? Now that I know where the house is, I don't need to own it to use it. All right, guys, let's just go finish this draft. Okay. Exactly. Who's got the board? I hid the board in the coffin under Ted. What? Why would you do that? Well, because if I hid it on him, everyone would have seen it. Oh, Taco! You idiot! Okay, let's everyone just go through your own picks, round by round, and figure out who we have. For running backs, I definitely had Peterson and Lynch. Oh, bullshit. No, I drafted Lynch. No... What? You did. You drafted David Lynch, I'm pretty sure. Oh, come on, Ruxin! I know. This is crazy. I definitely had Jordan Cameron. That's the only thing I'm sure. Oh, come on. No! No! Why do we have to argue? You wrote it all down on the computer. I do it at the end when it's all done. You were typing the entire time. I know. I was just doing research for my draft. No! You have to... What are you talking about? ! What are you talking about? You are such an embarrassment, Sacko. It's because of stupid shit like this that everyone thinks that MacArthurs are idiots. All I know is I drafted LeGarrette "Blounts," and I never got him. I guess we should just redraft. (all saying "No!") No way! I know what you're trying to do here, okay? You're trying to get rid of your shitty team. There's way too much on the line here with the beach house. Yeah. So, what are we gonna do? We got to get that draft board out of the coffin. I was looking over Ted's will, and there was something very specific that he wanted us to do. Yeah, sure. What? Look, we all know how much Ted loved flash mobs, right? Flash mobs? Uh... Yeah. Oh, Ted loved a good flash mob. Flash mobs. Fla... I thought you said something different. Flash mobs. Yeah, of course. Flash mobs. Mm-hmm, exactly. We did a flash mob today. Well, Ted would like there to be a flash mob at his funeral. Great idea. Beautiful, yeah. Beautiful celebration of life. Okay. Here's the plan. Once the rabbi starts the mourner's kaddish, he wants you to kick it off. Here's your outfit. You put this on underneath your clothes. We've already got ours on right now. Okay. Oh, wait a second. Wait. Why do I have to start this? What are you talking about, why you? You were always Ted's favorite. He called you "the first among equals." Well, I can't argue with Ted. I mean, he knows what he's talking about. I'm gonna do this. Ted would have wanted it this way. You guys really think you can pull this off? Of course. It's gonna be great. Hmm. Holy shit. Look who came to Ted's funeral. It's Cameron Jordan and Jordan Cameron. I wonder if Ruxin knows the difference. Time to find out. Excuse me. Hi. Jordan Cameron, right? How you doing? Cameron Jordan. Nice. Nice. They usually get us confused. That's actually what I wanted to talk to you guys about. Would you mind doing us a quick favor? BOTH: Sure. Hey, Ruxin. Funniest thing happened on the way to the funeral. We met a guy you drafted. You should say hello to the person you drafted. Yeah. What's up, man? How you doing? Cleveland Browns tight end. Yeah. What's my name? What's my name? (laughing): What's my...? No, what's really... what's-what's my name? Dude, what's my name, bro? Rodney. Rodney. What's mine? Mine? Dude, your name. Come on, bro. I drafted you, bro. You drafted me. You got to know my name. I drafted... Who did you draft? I... I'll tell you who I drafted. I drafted a Pro Bowl player. You made the Pro Bowl? Yeah. Did you? I made the Pro Bowl. Oh, you're both in the Pro Bowl. (Ruxin clears his throat) That's cool. Tell the bro his name. It's like we're all bros here. You know what I mean? We're all here for Ted. Ted's our dude. Ted would know who he drafted. Jordan Cameron. Hmm. Which one did you point to? Wait a minute. It seemed like you weren't really specific. Come on, man. What's my name? Cameron Jordan. No. Oh. So, you did draft me? Yup. So your league must have IDPs. Is that an individual...? Individual defensive players. We play with those, Kevin? No, we do not. See, that's the even crazier part of all this, is that I was, like, "We should do IDP because individual defense players are not recognized enough." No, that's the opposite of what you said. You were adamant about drafting one shit-sipping defense and moving on with it. Direct quote. Hmm. Ouch. Aah! Just got IDP'd. Oh! Hey, J.J. Watt. No shit. Hi. Hi. Remember us? Hi. Yeah, yeah. How you been? You cost me $900 of my mini-bar last year. Yeah. Yup, that sure was me. So good to see you. We're friends. How's Arian Foster? How's the knee? Yeah, how is he? We're-we're at a funeral. That's very inappropriate. How's Clowney working in the three-four? Guys, are we here to pay our respects to Ted, or are we here to talk fantasy football? We ...are here to pay our respects to Ted. Thank you. Between you and me, though, DeAndre Hopkins, right? Wrong. Not the time, nor the place. Hello? Shalom? Guys. Everyone please be seated. The ceremony is about to begin. Oh... Welcome to a celebration of life. We will begin the memorial... Ah, it's really sad. I'm always secretly happy when good-looking people die. Oh, God, full of compassion, Thou Who dwellest on high, grant perfect rest beneath the sheltering wings of Thy presence... It's gonna be so great! Bye-bye, Teflondre. Where's Taco? Think he's trying to get a round in. (whistling) We will now read from Psalm 23... Hey, babe, I know we're still in the middle of it, but you are drafting really well. Can you not mess with me right now, please? Are you kidding me? You got Shady McCoy, Doug Martin and Drew Brees. Yeah. "...on paths of righteousness for His glory. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of dea..." I got movement down there. "... I fear no harm..." Really? We got blood flow. Mm. Yeah, tell me more about my middle rounds. Julius Thomas-- brilliant pickup, yeah. Yes, yes, yes, I know, I know, oh. Babe, I got roster wood. I got roster wood. Let's do this now. Let's go. What? We're at a funeral. I don't know when he's gonna come back, okay? Look, Ted would have wanted it this way. ...and may his soul be bound up... Okay. All right. Um, we have to get something out of the car. Oh, you forgot the Sacko? May the Lord be his possession, and may he rest in peace. Amen. We will now read the mourner's kaddish. Glorified and sanctified be God's great name throughout the world, which He has created and according to His will, may He establish... Yeah, yeah, yeah! This one's for Ted! Mazel, bitches! ♪ ♪ What is this? This is not the mourner's kaddish. ♪ ♪ Ted's high school friends are the worst. All right, that's 200 yards to the green. Aw! Shanked it! Here, come, come on. Flash mob. Andre, this is a funeral. Have some respect. And break. (rabbi gasps, groans) Oh, my God! He's unconscious. Isn't there a doctor in the house? Yeah, I-I'm a doctor. Okay, I need some ice, a cold compress and some hydrogen peroxide. He's gonna save this guy's life. That's pretty impressive. I didn't know Andre had it in him. No, no, no! BOTH: Teflondre. Jesus Christ. The worst funeral ever. Well, I'll see you there. All right, great. Well, we'll definitely have dinner then. Goddamn Teflondre. It's crazy. What did I miss, boys? Oh, just Ted's funeral. Where were you? Brutal day on the links. Not as brutal as it was in there. But you know what? It is time for Operation Draft Board. Where the hell's Kevin? I don't care where Kevin is. All right, here's the thing. We're the pallbearers, right? BOTH: Mm-hmm. So, we grab the coffin, we run around behind the building. Mm-hmm. Put it down for a second, pull out the draft board, close it up, get back in line. Nobody's the wiser. Great. Just for the record, I think it was a terrible idea to put the draft board in the coffin. Duly noted. Duly noted. Oh, we got this right here. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you so much. No, we got it. We got it. We got it. Oh, uh, what are you doing? We're pallbearers, too. Oh... cool. Oh. Um... Uh, it's cool, Cameron. We got it. J-Jordan. It's Cam. Right, Cam. We know... Jordan. Jordan. Listen, Cameron, we got this. It's okay. Uh, what he means to say is, maybe if I go on this side, and then... Mm-hmm. And then what would happen? If you guys back up for a second... And then maybe you guys could And then they would come in. come on this side... Right, and then we would just... And then, I think we just go! Did they just steal the coffin? Should we go get it? No. I'm giving them a 50-yard head start. In there, in there. It's a closet. Here? What? No! Oh, God! Oh, oh, oh, what are you doing? What-what are you doing? ! Oh, we're grieving in our own special way. What does it look like we're doing? It looks like you're having really said, middle-aged sex. But clearly, you wouldn't do that in a morgue. I had roster wood. From that shitty lineup? She likes it. It was okay. Guys, what's going on here? In front of Ted? ! Can you guys not be morons for one day? Get it together! Come on, Ted. Looks like we got to redraft, huh? Uh, no. No, no. I don't think so. No, that... This is a final... Oh, that's Ted. If that is Ted, who is in the coffin? Ted Rappaport was a great man, and he was loyal to his friends. Even friends that weren't so great. But now, Ted, we must say good-bye. I got it! (Taco whoops, laughs) My God. (people gasp and scream) Oh, my God. What is going on? Oh, don't worry. It's just a draft. Ted's still dead. (crying): Oh. "Festival of Magic"? This whole town's gonna be full of magicians turning tricks! Hi, Jimmy, Jr. Hi, Zeke. What are you wearing? Is it cape o'clock, already? It's for the Young Magicians Competition. I'm in it to win it. Abraca-yeah-bro! I support ya! I didn't know you were into magic. I thought you were more into dancing. Well, I dance a lot during my magic. Like this. ♪ Ta-da! Whoa! Where'd the hell that come from? ! He's like a magical florist! Thank you. Oh. Whoop! Maybe I'll come to the competition and cheer for you. Whatever. It's a free country. He's so patriotic. Okay, then, see you at our date. It's not a date. Yes, it is. Not really. Pretty much, it is a date. Definitely not. Whoop. Oh, this promotion is a great idea, Bob! I love magic! I know. Me, too. Ooh, I'm gonna stick a quarter in my ear, so they have something to pull out. Yeah, the only problem is, this sign could actually attract magicians, so... Louise, this will be good for business. Plus, magic is fun. Mm-mm. Magic can take you to places you could never possibly imagine. Like Delaware! Oh, look, here comes our first magician. Or a Wild West wedding DJ? Hello. Hello... Hello. Um, I couldn't help but notice your sign. Notice anything else? Whoops. Uh, oh, where'd that come from? Uh, come on in, Mr., uh... Mars Sazerac. Boy, that is a... magicky name. Hold on. How do we know you're a magician? Show us a trick! Oh, write my name on a piece of cake, put it in a box, and I'll eat it! Sorry, don't listen to him. He's just wants to eat cake. Fine, write it on a piece of pizza and put it under my desk. It's always gonna have something to do with eating something. Just hiding food in places that he already knows the location of. I mean, it would be nice to see something, like a trick. Well, I suppose me and my 52 friends could use the exercise. Oh, God, it's happening! Miss, could I ask you to be my assistant? Oh, I couldn't. No. Okay I'll do it! Oh, that's right, magicians have assistants... Ta-da. Now I'll need a volunteer Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me...! Me! You're already the assistant, Linda. Oh. You win.

And while you're doing that, Linda's going to get me your biggest knife. I have it right here. Butcher knife, check! Whoa, why do you have that? Me and Gene were playing pirates. Mm-hmm. Pick a card, Bob. Show it to them, not me. Okay, everyone, here's my card. Nice one, Dad. Okay. That was not a very good trick. Now, Linda, cut the deck, literally. Go on! Whack it! All right, step back. Whaaah! Whoa! Still not a great trick. Well, well, looks like we have a survivor. Recognize this? ! Ha-ha! That's not my card. Oh. Hit the bricks, Fail-dini! You had your shot, you blew it. Well, so much for the magician's discount. In fact, maybe I should pay you. Wait... that looks like my wallet. Did you take my wallet? Oh-ho-ho, slow down, there, Bob. Before you call the cops, you'd better check the I.D. My card! Oh, my! Wait... how did you pick my pocket? I didn't feel anything. Oh, I feel something. I feel like I want to magically steal things, too. This must be what it's like when people get called to the priesthood. I accept. Whoa! I've seen canned tuna, but never canned Tina! Ugh! You're such a locker stalker. Good one, Tammy. I know. Oh, hi, Jimmy Jr. It's like I was padlocked in a box, and you set me free. Um, okay. Hi. How did you know my locker combination? It only took a couple thousand tries. Allow me. Okay. Is there anything else I could assist you with? Uh, I need to get my science book. This perfectly ordinary textbook. Thanks. You know, I could also assist you with your magic act as your magician's assistant. Classy. Like a lady butler. Um, okay, I-I guess you could do that. I practice after school. Oh, okay, cool. All right, see ya. Yes! Yes! Yes! What? What? Oh, I just found a cool book I've been meaning to read. Oh, it's mine. Oh. That's his! Can I borrow it? No, I don't think so. I kinda need it. Okay, I'll read it here. Bye. Um, Jimmy Junior? ! What, Tina? Maybe I should be facing the audience, too? Fine. Um... okay, there's more? Remember? The blades? I remember! Stupid magic. ♪ Ta-dance! Uh, hello? Jimmy Jr.? What, Tina? If this were a dancing competition, forget about it. But you might want to put a little more flair into the actual magic. What makes you such an expert, Tina? You've only been doing magic for a day. I've been doing it for nine days! Jimmy Jr., they spilled a crate of yogurt in the cafeteria! Let's go slide around in it! Cool, Zeke. Come on! Let's go! Wait up, Zeke! Okay, I'll be here. Sweep up all the confetti, okay? Okay, Gene, let's start with an easy mark. Uh, there we go. You distract while I extract. Got it. Andy, there's something I need to ask you, but you have to really focus on me while I'm saying these words! Oh, okay! I'll focus, too! I've never done that before! What do you think of bacon? Hmm? Bacon, bacon, bacon. Andy, someone's trying to steal your candy! Ugh! Thanks, Ollie! You're welcome, Andy! Damn it, Ollie! How did you know? ! I felt it coming out of Andy's pocket! Get a womb, you wacky twins. That hurt my feelings. I felt it hurt your feelings! You did? Yes! Ah-choo! Oh, I wish somebody had a really long handkerchief up their sleeve. Anybody? Hmm? Come on. Where's the pizazz-matazz? I thought they'd get more food. They split an order of fries three hours ago and they haven't ordered anything since. Now they're just loitering. They tricked you, Bob! It's what they do! So, Sazerac, can I get you and your friends anything else? Remember, it's half off, so don't hold back. Ah, well, your delicious fries have left my fingers greasy. Bring me a huge plate of napkins. Well, how 'bout a burger? I can get you a... Napkins. All right, napkins. Get him a napkin. Hey, Bob, I think he got your wallet again. And keys! And your gas pills! And your dignity. Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha, great. Hi, I'm looking for a magician's assistant's costume. Something classy! So no butt cheek! Well, you're in luck! This is my last assistant's costume in your size. The sequins are French crystal. Well, French-Canadian. Is that good? How much do you know about sequins? Nothing. They're the best. She'll take it! Rented! Okay, what else? How's your magician set for cups and balls? I beg your pardon! Oh... That looks pretty advanced. My magician's better with his feet than his hands. He's more of a dance-ician? Well, for those with only the slightest sleight-of-hand, you can't go wrong with magic rope. ♪ Ta-da! Great. I'll take that too. The only thing I need now is some magic between me and my magician. Whoa, whoa, whoa... Are you talking about mixing magic and romance? Big time. Don't do it! It's dangerous. Also, don't mix magic with taxes. Or plumbing. That's okay... danger is my middle name. But I spell it R-U-T-H. It spells Ruth. Yeah. Yeah, it does. Mm-hmm. Looks like there's a wait, huh? Yeah. Maybe I'll just come back later. Oh, hold on, that guy's getting up. No, he's levitating! What? Nope, he was just leaning over to fart. You know what? I'll handle this. What are you gonna do? Yeah, wait, you'll see. What? Look, guys, you've been here all day working on one order of fries, so... Understood, Bob. Let me settle my tab. Do you have change for this? Sorry I don't have anything smaller. No, you know what? To be honest, Sazerac, I don't even enjoy this anymore. I don't, I, I, honestly don't even like magic that much now, because of you. So, you and your friends, you now all pay full price. No magicians' discount. Well, if that's how you feel, you can have your fries back. Oh, my God. Oh, God! Look, it says "Ta-da"! That's it! I don't care that that was good. You and your regurgitated potatoes and the rest of your magic buddies, you're banned! Bob, you can't just ban them! This isn't the '60s, you know! Fellow conjurers, let's go somewhere our craft is appreciated. Like my mother's! Oh, and one last thing, Bob. Your name goes in the book. What book? The "Enemies of Magic" book. Good! I want to be in your stupid book because I am an enemy of magic! Well, then this is the perfect book for you! Will this page do? Love it! Don't gasp, Linda! Oh! Don't you gasp! Rest assured, Bob, I will never set foot in this restaurant again. And yet, you will never be rid of me! I just got chills! Oh, my God. Come on, J-Ju, get your dance on! I'm doing it, Zeke. My little tiny dancer. Here we go! Look, Jimmy Jr. I got something new for our act... magic rope. Cool! A rope! No, that's not how it works. Yee-hah! Whoo! No... Giddy up, magic cowboy! Come on! Look, you're supposed to cut the rope, then restore it. I can show you. Oh, cool, scissors! Hyah! Hyah! Jimmy Jr., stop. Snipping and a-whipping. Doola-di-doo! Jimmy Jr., stop. Tina, move! Listen to me! Stop it, Tina. I can't dance to the sound of you telling me what to do. Yeah! Boom! I'm trying to help. Assist me assist you. You know what, Tina? This isn't working. That's why we have to keep practicing. No, this isn't working. I am firing you. What? You can't stop my dancing! You can't tie me up with your magic rope! Holy moly! Tell it, James Ju! I'm not trying to tie you up, you gorgeous idiot! Maybe I should enter this stupid contest myself just to show you an actual magic act! You see that, Zeke? Yeah. She got pretty mad. She's a trip. Her face turned purple. Plus, you're not even a magician, Tina. I am now! Oh. It worked in the store. Look, Zeke, tassels! Yeah! Come on, let me touch 'em. So, you and your magician split up... big surprise. Jimmy Junior thinks assistants should be sequined and not heard. So, presto. Now I'm the magician. So, uh... what do you got for this no-trick pony, eh? Set her up. Young lady, you're in luck. Here's a classic of escapology... the straitjacket. Last one in your size.

Forget the restaurant, Bob. You're gonna be cursed, no matter what. You might as well come support your daughter. And let's be honest, Dad, how much more cursed can you really get? What, is he gonna give you an even weirder body? Thanks, Louise. You got it. Great. Sazerac's the emcee. I can't get away from that idiot. So... maybe... I'm going to get even with him. What?

Uh-oh, that's not good. Ow. That's a peppercorn. Say that again. Now we cut out the heart of Jimmy Junior's act and put in this. "Poly-rhythmic synth-jazz"! No one can dance to that. That's right. Not even Jimmy Junior. Yeah! Here's the new music for Jimmy Junior's act. Um, I don't see anything on my list about new music. Look, we did a Kickstarter to make this music Oh, okay, okay! All right! Oh, boy. I snuck into Sazerac's dressing room and I found his stupid book and tore my name out. What? You did what? Ooh... Ooh, you smell like salami. Thank you, and welcome to the Young Magician's Competition! These kids are the magic stars of the future. Well, not all of them. Some will give up, become teachers, doctors... I know, I know. I agree, but come on. Let's hear it for our first contestant, The Amazing Jimmy Pesto Junior and his assistant, Tammy Larson! That's not my music. Just go with it. I can't dance to this! Damn it! It looks like he's having a funky stroke. I miss you, Grandpa! This doesn't bother me at all, watching my almost boyfriend get horribly humiliated... Ah! Yes, it does! I can't do this! I gotta save him. It's not too late. Oh, maybe it is too late. Still, I've gotta try. What are you doing out here? Trying to save you. I switched your music to something with a nine-eight time signature. That's like dance Kryptonite! I know, I'm sorry. I was really mad at you for firing me and for replacing me with Tammy. I'm sorry, too, for being so sensitive about my dancing. So what do we do now? We have the rest of our lives to figure that out. No, I mean right now. Oh. Get off the stage, Tina! You're not his assistant. I am! Deal with it! Sorry, Tammy, I can't hear you while you're rolling away so fast. Aah! Hi, Tammy! Bye, Tammy! Great magic! Well, should I do a trick? No, I'll be the magician and you assist me with your dancing. I told you, I can't dance to this music! And I probably can't get out of this. But follow my lead anyway. Okay, Tina. Is this part of the show? Yeah, right? Do a trick! And now, with the help of my lovely assistant, I will perform an amazing escape from the Jacket of Doom. Huh. I thought we were getting revenge. More like revenge on us, having to watch. Ho-ho. And now for the master to become the mark... This... isn't going well... Aah! ♪ Ta-dance. Hah! And now, for the winner of the Young Magician's Competition... The envelope, please! I can't believe you got out of that thing. How'd you do it? Magic. Would you mind popping my shoulder back in? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Now, that's what I call air mail! The $500 grand prize goes to... Peter Pescadero, the Impescadaralist! I can't turn it off! Thank you! And the Honorable Mention Award for On-Stage Chemistry goes to... Tina Belcher and Jimmy Pesto Junior! Go, Tina! What? ! "On Stage Chemistry"? That's almost as good as off-stage chemistry. Why don't you two nerds go have wizard babies? Enjoy your prize. A $50 gift certificate from Wands! Wands! Wands! magic shop. Can not be applied to the purchase of wands. Sweet. Thanks, Tina. Don't thank me, thank my lips. Thanks, lips! See ya! Now I see him, now I don't. Way to go, Tina! Your trick was the best! Everyone was talking about it. Thanks, Mom. Cool if we don't hug? So you won the Honorable Mention Onstage Chemistry award. That's something, right? No, I've thought about it and I don't think it is anything. Meanwhile, I picked my first pocket. Sazerac's. Oh, the "Enemies of Magic" book. Thanks, Louise, but I already tore my name out and look what I put in. Wait, what is this? "Look on the back of the page you tore out." "Dear Bob, I knew this is how it would end... "...you sneaking into my dressing room, "licking my cold-cuts, "and ripping your name out of the book, which I then let Louise take from my pocket." He let me take it? Wow. That guy is good. Yeah, he's great! There's a P.S. "P.S. I farted on the meat." Oh! Oh, God! Oh! Well, I hope you learned your lesson, Bob. Don't lick meat. Disagree. What do you call a good looking Arab? What the fuck? Thanks, mate. Who are we escorting next, habibi? Put it this way... It's a pencil-pushing tight-ass prick you would love to punch the fuck out of, the Defense Minister. Ah, shit! He's the reason we got no decent fresh food in this place. He keeps cutting the budget, pretty soon we'll be throwing rocks like your mob! Ha, ha, ha. Your last deployment mate. Going to miss you, Baz. This place is gonna be damn boring without you! Ah, you'll find another Arab to take the piss out of, I'm sure! Yeah, but not a half Arab. Hold your tongue or I'll stick this rifle up your ass, wanker! Yeah, you'd like that, hey! What the fuck is that? ! - Sir! Sergeant Smith and I will be your escorts to the U.S. Green Zone this morning, sir. ETA 20 mikes. - What? Ah, it will take us 20 minutes to get to the American base, sir. Yeah, of course. What happened to all our Black Hawk helicopters? Well, sir, ah... All the Black Hawks are currently down at the moment, well, with all the budget cuts. You see that flak jacket you're wearing, sir? Yeah? It has no armored plating. A bullet would go straight through that. It's true, I'm using it as a window shield in my room. Well, you blokes do realize that there is a recession going on, right? Yes sir, we understand that. But with all due respect, it's just hard to do our job when our equipment's falling apart. What the fuck was that? ! Oh, I wouldn't worry about that too much, sir. It was nothing. What do you fucking mean, "nothing?" That thing just shat its pants! Well, sir... due to the budget cuts, the thing that just shat its pants, is the only thing we have to get us where we're going. Is it safe? Yes sir, it's safe. We'll get you back to your recession in one piece. Might be a good idea to stop cutting the budget, right sir? - Fuck me... New flak jackets and helicopters for everyone. Right on! About time, you fucking wanker. Abdallah! The pride of the Golani Brigade. Yeah, not yet. The pricks won't let me back, till I pass my psych test. That's because you... need to stop head-butting brick walls. You still taking your meds? Don't need them. Shit! You got to chill out, man. They are living in Haifa, they are both retired. Actually, his wife used to babysit me and my brother. I don't like the look of him. Have fun looking at a screen and try not to kill anyone. Fuck you, you goddamn cook! Hey, I love my job! What a beautiful day. What a fucking shit hole! Damn. Don't be closing that door there. How else am I gonna tan this beautiful body of a man, huh? What? You heard me. Good arm there, boy. Now... Don't be closing the door. You hear me? Welcome! You must be Ari? You're one friendly motherfucker, you ever hear that? This place is a shit fight. I've never seen a comm's center run so goddamn poorly. Settle down, Justin Timberlake, that's the way thing's run up here. You need to get with the program, okay. Oh yeah? - Yeah. Well, I want to talk to the officer in charge, right now. Well, let me get right on that. Okay, son? They told me about you. You're that snapperhead with no personality. You listen to me! I'm a special forces soldier of the Golani Brigade! You hear me? Uh-uh, you were! You're a fucking nobody. Now you listen up, cocksucker. Imma be leavin' this shithole tomorrow morning, so I'll be cussing... and uh, drinking and calling you a cocksucker, okay? Now uh... You see them three bars... here, on my beautiful shirt? That means, I'm Captain... Officer. And by the looks of things, you're just a fucking grunt, so... That means, I... am the officer... in charge. Impossible. - Ah... Uh-uh, the Israeli officer wasn't feeling well, so they sent him home. So, it's just you and me, motherfucker, until tomorrow morning, okay? Get your bag, get back in your hooch, get suited and booted right now. Fuck off! Ah, this is going to be fun. Ah look, it's Aunty Samira! So... how's mom? She's good, yeah, she's still busy with the café. Never stop's working. She's a workaholic, alright. So when are you leaving the village and heading back home? Australia? This is where I belong. Nice uniform, wanker! Did your wife iron it for ya? HabibiBassam! Still patrolling the border? I am now in charge of a platoon. Woohoo, big man! Pride of the Lebanese Army. So... tonight... You come with me. Where to? - Kfar Kila. Why would I want to go there for? You are Lebanese, Baz, be proud. Your father fought for this land, yeah? And? - You should go... The girls will be fine here. Get out and smell the fresh air around here. Fresh air, huh? We'll only be gone for a few hours? - Of course. I even have a uniform for you. Uniform? ! She puts up with your shit? The wife must always respect and obey the man. Oh, that's right, I forgot, we're still in the village. This is how you treat your wife? In front of our friends? A real man would treat me like a princess! Look at Baz, how he treat Jewels. I'm sorry princess, please forgive me. You are so beautiful. She's beautiful, ah, yeah? I love you. Later I give you nice massage. What, are impossible. In the 20th century, but maybe not in the 30th. - Maybe not, but we're in 1 99 7. - That's what it seems. - I paid for it to seem like that. - Listen! If this is a dream-- Look at me! If this is a dream, it means that I don't exist! - I just imagine you. - No! - César, I'm real. - How do I know that? Can't you tell a dream from reality? Is this a dream, eh? Tell me, is this a dream? César, I'm wearing myself out over this case. There is no case. I didn't kill anyone. It's all a nightmare. Fuck it, César, trust me! This isn't a dream. - They got it wrong. - Who? I don't know! But they mixed up Sofia and Nuria! I see a face that isn't mine. I'm sick of hearing that! Your face is fine. You're behaving like a child, hiding behind that mask. - Go on, take it off! - I don't want to see myself! I don't care about that. I want to see you. Don't you realize? All that matters is what I see! It's my dream! Say that once more and I'll have you locked up in an asylum. Show me your face. Now. You owe it to me. César, look in the mirror and tell me if you think you're disfigured. God! Why do you keep seeing what isn't there? - You look fine. - I'm a monster! What do you mean? Anybody'd like to have your face. You look normal. Not just normal. You're handsome! César, listen. Maybe you've got something like anorexia. Some girls insist they're fat and end up crazy. César! I want to wake up! I want to wake up! - Hold it! - I want to wake up! Fuck! Shit! - Freeze! - Don't shoot! This is a nightmare! It's a nightmare! You! Wait a minute! You're not to leave! Stop! Wait a minute! It's a dream! It's a dream! Don't move! Drop the gun! - I want to wake up. I want to wake up. - Don't move! I want to wake up! Antonio. Antonio! What? You're crushing me. I'd better not move. I've been shot in the back. How do you know? Well... because-- What's going on here? What the fuck's going on? I told you, it's a dream. Shut up! Shut up! I know what this is. It's one of those Candid Camera jokes. You did a great job, I loved it, but enough's enough! - I see someone. - Where? Up there, on the roof. I can't see a thing. Where are you going? Come on, Antonio. Don't think about it anymore or you'll go crazy. Hello, César. It's time I introduced myself. My name is Serge Duvernois. I represent Life Extension. We met... 1 50 years ago. What? Has the world gone mad? There's no world. It's all in that gentleman's mind. Including you and me. Sure! Shall I thump you to see if it hurts? Try it. They can make you disappear right now, like everyone else. - And who are "they," may I ask? - The company. Life Extension. They know everything we're saying. They know what is going through César's mind an instant after he thinks it. If they can make me disappear, why haven't they done it? It would be virtually incorrect. You've just saved his life. Virtually incorrect? Do you think I'm an idiot or what? No, quite the opposite. You're a great guy. A character who is very necessary for César. A character? - Where are you going? - To look for someone. There is no one. People aren't necessary now. Why didn't you wake me before? You only had to ask. But that was difficult. Because, in theory, you wouldn't know you were dreaming. Since when? Remember the day of the discotheque? That night, when you fell asleep on the sidewalk... was the one chosen for the splice. What splice? The splice between your real life and your virtual life. A splice of 1 50 years which you didn't notice... because you were dead and frozen. From when you woke up... nothing was real. We wiped what really happened from your memory. What was it? You never saw Sofia again. And the doctors were never able to rebuild your face. You woke up on that street with an awful hangover. You shut yourself away for months. One day you learned that we existed. You came to the office, you signed the contract... and then... you killed yourself. I paid for this? I paid for Nuria to come back as Sofia? I paid to look like a monster again? I paid to live this nightmare? You paid to live whatever you wanted. We just provided the setting and the characters. You invented your hell. I tried to warn you in that bar. I said it all depended on your mind. Do I just have to want it? - Can Antonio come-- - There's no one here. They can't have made 4 million people disappear! You've overcome your fears. If you want, we can try again... have you live a wonderful dream... with money, friends, Sofia, or whatever girl you want. You just have to ask. I don't want more dreams. It isn't a dream! César, listen to me. This is real. This man is a sham. Let's go down and look for people. Ignore him. It's logical for him to behave like this... but he doesn't feel anything. I don't feel anything? I don't feel anything? What do you know about what I feel? Ignore him, he isn't real. Yes, I am real! I've got a wife and two daughters. His personality is designed so that he'll say all this now. Where are my daughters? God! César, we can offer you another possibility. In 1 99 7, it was impossible to rebuild your face. But out there, it's the year 2 1 45. You wouldn't believe the things surgery can do. You could wake up... and live in the future like a normal person. - In the future? - You have to choose. How could I wake up? How would you wake from your worst nightmare? No, César, don't listen to him! Your partners set this up! They want you to kill yourself! He's done that. Now it'll just be a formality. - I'm going to do it. - Very well. Do you have any wish before you die? Let them out there read my mind. Who are you? I don't know. Don't keep suffering. It's all in your head. It's all psychological. Come on, César. - What will happen to them? - Don't prolong this farewell. You think they're your friends, but they're just images. That man isn't really crying. - I forgot, I get vertigo. - Then don't look. Good-bye, César. Relax. Relax. Open your eyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Openyoureyes. Whytellme that dream? Yousaidlcouldtellyou whateverl wanted. Allright. Anything elseyou shouldtellme before westart? Nothingyou don �t know. I wasabout to turn 25. llikedeating, sleeping, making love, like everyone. Andyou know what everyone does when theyget up. OPEN YOUR EYES Where are you going? Out. Stop leaving messages on the alarm. Why? Just don �t. Because it pisses me off. Come on, for fuck �s sake. - I �ll slaughteryou. - We �ll see about that. You �ve got three cars. Why do we always go in this wreck? Come on. I �m in a hurry. Are you backing out? I missed class for this. I �m seeing my partners after. Why do you think I �m dressed up? So you can shout at them. You like that. I don �t shout. - So tell me, did you screw her? - Screw who? Whoever was there when I rang last night. I was alone last night. Anyway, what is it to you? Nothing. You can do what you want with your life. Thanks very much. Let �s change the subject. - Did you screw her? - Give me a break. I was on my own. So, you did. Was it the one you talk so much about? - Who? - That Nuria. My God, I can �t believe it! César seeing the same woman twice! - She must be great in bed. - She isn �t bad. Bastard! When are you going to tell me the secret? - What secret? - The recipe for Coca-Cola. - Look, the kind you like. - Yeah. Change the-- What did you eat today? Nothing. That �s my problem. I �m starved! It �s funny when you ask them what they value most in a man. "I like him to be intelligent, to be honest, to be kind." It �s all shit! You �d have problems ifyou were like me. Not that again! You aren �t ugly. Anybody would like to have your face. You �re normal. - Normal. That doesn �t mean handsome. - You �re handsome. I �m acceptable, when you �re not beside me. You �re like anorexics. They insist they �re fat, and end up crazy. When some girl ties you down, the rest of us will get a chance. - Yeah, yeah. - Why not? Ifyou meet the right girl-- She doesn �t exist. Shit! - How did I miss that? - God punished you. You �re for it. - Who are you saying that to? - To God. Doyou believe in God? - Don �tstart allthatshit. - ljust askeda question. Ifyou don �t want to, don �t answer. I don �t believe in God. How do you explain what happened? - How do you mean? - Your face. - There is no explanation. - I believe there is. - You believe I �m mad. - I only believe what I see. You haven �t let me see your face yet. And I won �t. Do you really think you �re a monster, César? - Come on, let me see. - Stickyour hand up your ass! Take it easy, brat! I �m sick ofall your stories. - Leave me alone! - I �ll kick the shit out ofyou! Leave me alone! I can �t work with you in here. Leave us on our own. On my responsibility. You �rejust a spoiled brat who-- My parents are dead, asshole! You made up a story so as not to admit what you did. Is that true? What? That you �re a spoiled brat. My father had a restaurant chain. That �s not my fault. When did your parents die? Fifteen years ago, in an accident. - And now you �re rich. - So they say. Then why don �t you want a lawyer? They say they can get me the best. - But they want me stuck here forever. - Who are they? My partners. They �ve been sucking my blood since I was a kid. Now they �ve got everything. They �ve cut me out. It wasn �t them. It was me. I don �t care. Let �s see, César. Do you know why you �re here? - Because I wear a mask, I guess. - No. Because you killed someone. Or don �t you remember? - Tell me, don �t you remember? - Fuck! Stop it! We must get things clear ifyou want us to get on. I don �t want us to get on! Is your solution to sit in this hole and not talk? - Aren �t we talking now? - After two months. I �ve been trying for two months. - Read the reports. - I �ve read them. I want you to tell me, if possible, sitting on a chair. Or are you going to stay there? I like the floor. It �s the only thing that seems real. What does everything else seem? Everything else is a lie. All this seems a lie, including you. You don �t even wear a white coat. - Do you think I should? - Doctors wear them. I took it offso you �d forget I was a doctor. So that you �d like me more. It didn �t work. I hate the sight ofyou. Now that we �re friends-- - I �ve got no friends. - Tell me what happened. The sooneryou talk, the sooner I �ll go. Hey! Happy birthday and all the things people usually say. Thankyou, thankyou. - Where did you find her? - In the library. - She tried to steal my book. - It was mine. - Anyway, César, Sofía. - Hello. Happy birthday. - Thankyou. - Your present. - Thanks a lot. - We bought it between us. Then I have to thank both ofyou. Stop chatting her up and open it. - I �d rather open them tomorrow. - Whatever. - Like a drink? - Sure. I �ll leave this upstairs. Hello. - What are you doing here? - Happy birthday, darling. Thankyou. But I didn �t askyou to the party. That was nice ofyou. I brought you a present, too. Why not open it? No, thanks. I already know what �s inside. - And last night? - Listen, Nuria. I don �t like you just turning up, much less coming into my room. - Well! Do I have to apologize? - No. You have to go. Right. I know what it is. You don �t want to be seen twice with the same girl. It would ruin your reputation. - You got it in one. - And there �s someone else. - Right? - Who? The brunette you were talking to a minute ago? Well, she �s not bad. I don �t care. I don �t need to be seen with you. Hold me. Come on. A little kiss. Come on. Until when? Until next Friday? Can you manage a weekend without me? Excuse me. I must see to my guests. Yes, the brunette will take time. She looks that type. - That type? - Yes. The kind who can �t find your zipper. - Hello. - Hello. - What did you want? - To open this. Wait. I �ll serve you. Since when are you the waiter? Don �t you know I �m in catering? Are you all right? - Can �t you tell I �m elbowing in? - A bit. I �ve got a slight problem. - A girl �s chasing me. - You don �t say. - I need help to get rid of her. - And I �m that help. Shit! There she is! - Where? - Don �t look. Look over here. That �s it. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. - Here we are. - Here we are. Well, act as ifwe were talking about something real interesting. Nod your head, agree, say yes. You know. - What a nice conversation. - Yes. - And she �s coming this way. - Fuck! - What are you doing? - Don �t worry, I �ll guide you. - Straight on. - I don �t see her. Here it is. Go right in. - I �m not going in there. - Well, I am. So long. - He �s in here. - You-- Well, we �re safe. But we �ve got nothing to drink here. I think all you really want is to chat with me. Yes, that too. First, I want to save my skin. Can �t you say you aren �t interested? She wouldn �t care. She never gets tired. - She must be feeling bad. - Yeah. Ofcourse. So you �re studying drama, like Pelayo? - For now. - Scenography? - Acting. - Really? To be an actress? I am an actress. Is that a problem? Yes. Aren �t you ashamed? Ashamed? Why should I be ashamed? Actors aren �t honest. You �re able to show emotions you don �t have... or which, at most, you invent. Right now you could be thinking... "This guy is a real drag. How can I dump him?" - Really? - "And in catering. A pain in the ass." But you �re a good actress. It doesn �t show. - Hey, Pelayo! - I caught you. - Come in. - How �s it going? Great. I �m a bit out of it now. Drunk, you mean. Why are you in here? Sofía was protecting me from a female psychopath out there. - She seemed dangerous. - Yeah. - What about you? - I was drinking. Women don �t chase me. - We �re out ofdrink. - Here. - Shit. - I �ll get some more. For all of us. Well, I guess I �ll be going. - Why? - I �m drunk and don �t feel well. Don �t be stupid. It �sjust starting. - Foryou, it is. - Pelayo, you can �t go. You �re my guest of honor. You �re a son ofa bitch, César. - Why �d you say that? - The party �s full of girls. I go for a piss, you start talking to her, and-- What? Nothing. And I look like an asshole. Tell me what �s wrong. - Why do you have to chat up Sofía? - No one �s chatting up Sofía. Yeah, and I �m blind, right? You �re certainly drunk. I �m drunk, but I �ll tell you this. I like Sofía a hell ofa lot. She may even be the girl of my dreams. But ifshe fucks up our friendship, she can go to hell. I feel the same. Sure. Pelayo, where are you going? - Home. - Already? - Yeah, I �m wrecked. - I �ll come with you. Don �t bother. You stay. Are you going, too? I have to get up early. I can run you home later. Stay on. I �m leaving you in good hands. What �s wrong with him? He �s drunk. - Is he annoyed with us? - No. You sure? She doesn �t look too happy. Didn �t you have to get up early? I �m doing too much foryou tonight. - Maybe it means something. - Yeah. That you �ve got a nerve. It �sjust for a minute. Long enough for my friend Nuria to admit defeat. This is my place. - Don �t dare laugh at it. - Why would I laugh? It �s nothing special, but it �s cheap. - Do you like clowns? - They �re not clowns. They �re mime artists. Pancho! - I �ve got a cat. - I hate cats. They �re almost as false as actresses. Says the caterer. How do you pay for this? Do your parents help? Do you work? He �s real nosy, isn �t he, Pancho? I �m an arms dealer. Fancy that! I always wanted to know how arms dealers lived. Now you do. Howcan lexplain it toyou? You wouldn �t understand. Even ldon �t understand. She wasmaking coffee andlstartedsnoopingaround. Suddenly, lgot thisstupidfeeling a lot ofpeopleget. Well, I like it. - What didyou feel? - That llovedher. - God, I �m even embarrassedto say it. - I didn �t hearyou. I said I like your place. And I like yours. Let �s swap. You wouldn �t like it tomorrow morning. I said it because ofthe decor. Your place is more personal. - And warmer. - Warmer? - Yes. - You think my house is cold? - A bit. - And am I? - I don �t know. - You said my house seemed cold. Ifyou �re waiting for me to list your virtues, hard luck. You thinkyou �re real smart. - Maybe. - Well, you �re wrong. I don �t need you to list my virtues. No, I �m sure you know what they are. - But you �d like me to see them, too. - So you say. I �m not going to argue about it. -Just as well. You �d lose. - Oh, yeah? But I don �t want to argue either. I propose we do the opposite. - We don �t argue? - We show our defects. Great! I hope you �re being fair. This is absolutely you. Well, mine is finished. Fuck! That �s how you see me? - Did I go too far? - Sign it. Let �s see mine. It �s lovely! - It �s not a caricature. - You see. You draw beautifully. - I �ll sell it to you. - Miser. How much? As it �s you, I �ll sell it for... a kiss. That smile �s going to kill me! It would be wrong ifwe did anything tonight. - Why? - Pelayo. Remember? Your best friend. He doesn �t have to find out. Besides, he �d do the same. I see friendship really matters to you. It does. That �s why I wouldn �t tell him. Somepeople... saythat they wouldbe happy with a normallife span. But "normal"meansdifferent things, depending on-- What are you looking at? I �m watching TV. The Romans, forinstance, livedonly25years. Today... that figure has tripled, which means that-- - What the fuck is he on about? - I saw this before. It �s about cryonization. Cryo what? When they freeze you or something. Like Walt Disney. Wow, that �s cold! Hey, you! There won �t be a landslide. It isn �t dangerous. Theground is firm here and verysolid. - Are you leaving? - I �m going home. Here �s my number. But I �ll call tomorrow. What for? All right, I won �t call. - César? - What is it? Come here. I want to tell you a secret. Come here. Hello, darling. Did you follow me? Ofcourse I didn �t. But I had the feeling we �d meet. - How was the brunette? - Good. Why? From your face, I �d say you didn �t sleep with her. Let me guess. You didn �t sleep with her, but you don �t mind. You have all the time in the world for that. And I bet you �re seeing her tomorrow. - Brilliant. - Aren �t I? There �s more. - Well? - I scored at the party, too. But he wasn �t up for it, so I �m still hot for it. - And? - And until you meet up again... with your Miss Universe, you could have fun. No. I think I prefer to go home and sleep. Come on, César. It �s your birthday. - Skip it. I �m going home. - What �s up, César? Are you scared? - Want some ofthis? - No, thanks. Sure, act innocent now. I don �t need that to enjoy myself. I see that. That �s not a good idea. Do what you want. What �s happiness foryou? - What? - For me, this is happiness. Being here with you. What about you? I can �t handle heavy conversations right now. Your thoughts are somewhere else, right? Maybe. One thing really bothers me. - What? - You know nothing about me. Except my name �s Nuria and I �m a good fuck. Two important things. You don �t know my address or telephone number. We have to start somewhere. I �m going to see your house now. It �s not far. Tell me something. Do you believe in God? - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - You got home all right? Yeah. Well, I had a horrible dream. That you never saw me again. Yes. I came out ofyour house, go to my car... and that crazy bitch has been following me. - Who, that Nuria? - Yes. She comes over and says, "Want a lift?" She goes on so much I don �t know how to say no. So I get in the car, she drives faster and faster... and kills herself. - With me inside. - That �s horrible. But the worst part... is that my face is completely destroyed... like "The Phantom ofthe Opera." I couldn �t wake up. I was a monster. You �re a monster anyway. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I �m a monster, too. Look. How was your house? Was anyone left? Left where? In your house. There was a party, remember? A party? Dreaming is shit. Unless the dream wasnice. ln thepark, childrenplaying, agirl who lovesyou. That �s why. Thenyou wake up andyou want to die. At first, ldidn �t even have thestrength to react. I �dbeen in a coma forthree weeks. You were lucky. You could �ve died like Nuria. And what? I would �ve been betteroff. Didyousee herbody? - I never did. - You think she didn �t die? I �m like you. I only believe what I see. César, show me your face, please. - What for? - Look. It �s true you had an accident. It �s true... that you were disfigured, but not anymore. Take that off. The doctors fixed you. They didn �t have a fucking clue! In the accident, you didn �t lose just skin and some muscle. The blow was so severe it caused a multiple fracture ofthe skull. We secured the osseous structure with metal wires... and over that, we reinserted the muscles... we could still retrieve. Yes, very nice, but I know all that. I �ve had it explained to me 1 50 times. But you never say when you �ll operate. - I �ve been waiting two months. - But we �ve operated three times. I wouldn �t call that an operation. I �d call it-- Well, I don �t know what you �d call it. The symmetry isn �t perfect... but what we �ve done with your face is, if I may say so... a craftsman �sjob. We can �t work on skin which is pure scars. No, no, there must be some way. - What? - "What?" You �re the doctors, aren �t you? A transplant, whatever! There �s a problem with fibrosis, ifwe operate again... we mayjust cause further damage. We �d need millimetric precision... and as oftoday it �s impossible. Let �s look at this. I �m not an idiot. Today, people change their breasts. They have hair implants. They even change the color oftheir skin. Are you saying that on the threshold ofthe year 2000... you can �t do a simple operation and sort out this fuck-up? - It isn �t so simple, César. Remember-- - Don �t patronize me! Stop treating me like a child! I �m notjust any patient. And this isn �t a welfare hospital. I �m willing to pay any amount. You �re in charge. They say you �re the best in your field. Well, invent something. Experiment with me. I �ve seen patients who �ve lost all their features... who can �t even talk. At least you can lookyourself in the eyes. What good is that? Every time I look in the mirror, I want to die. Your case isn �t so serious. Just learn to accept it. And who will accept me? Will you explain to the people who look at me in the street? Will you tell them that looks aren �t important? That beauty is on the inside? We �d like to show you something. What is this? A facial prosthesis. We use it in extreme cases of rejection like yours. This is shit! It �s not the best solution... but it �s all we can do for the moment. I want a face! Not a mask! I don �t work miracles. That �s what the bastard said. But in the end, they did. Did what? Work a miracle. So it seems. So it seems? Things are or they aren �t? - Did they do it or not? - I �m tired. Why don �t you go? I �ll be back on Tuesday. Want anything? - No. - All right. See you on Tuesday. A pad and a pencil. But don �t tell them. I don �t want to owe them anything. Have I changed so much? Because I recognize you. How are you? "How are you?" You �re playing a part now, but I don �t know what. Your lips are smiling. - But your eyes are trembling. - What? You �re really very good as an actress. I asked you how you were. You didn �t answer. I �m alive. How should I be? And I �m tired. Tired ofwaiting foryou to call, even to say "Tough luck." - I was busy. - Bullshit! I was afraid you �d feel uncomfortable if I rang. You were afraid you �d feel uncomfortable. Afraid you couldn �t look me in the face, like now. That �s not true. I �ve often dreamed ofthis moment. What moment? The moment we �d meet again. In my dream, we werejust like this. Here, in the park. Although something was different. What? It wasn �t raining. I have to go, César. - What are you doing tomorrow night? - Studying. I �m very busy. - It �s Friday. We could meet. - I �ve got a lot to do. All right, so long. César! We �ll meet ifyou want. Ifyou want. Assoon as there is theslightestpossibilityofdeath... thestabilization andtransport team goes into action. Once the client is declared legally dead... he isput into a maintenance capsule... andthe transport legalities aresortedout. ln thestoreroom inArizona in the U.S.A... a team ofspecialistsprepare the body forfinalfreezing. Among othermeasures... bloodis replacedbya solution whichpreserves the organs. Finally... the client isput in the capsule.... where he willremain untilmedicine can reenergize him. To be honest, I �dhave to thinkit over. It �shardto accept the idea. Howshould we viewit? We are, undoubtedly, facinga majordevelopment... a newchallenge forhumanity. It �s understandable that the first reaction is rejection. We have nowgot the means to do it. We �vegot the technology. But, above all, we have sufficient moralmaturity... to understand what thisnewstep means... forhuman evolution, to lookat the future... andput an endto certain meaningless taboos... inheritedfrom ancient religions... oldanduselessmemories. Thankyou forspeaking to us. Andthankyou to ouraudience-- - Hi. - Hi. - What �s that? - Shit, isn �t it? But they suggested I wear it in case of infection. Well, kid, what �re you up to? Arguing with doctors all day. - You should go out more. - I �m trying. - What �re you having? - Rum and Coke. You want one? - Yes. - I �ll get you one. I �m going to the bathroom. - Take that off. - Why? Don �t you realize you won �t be able to hide your face? I told you, it �s to stop infections. Sure. Ifyou �re embarrassed, just go. Nobody asked you to come. - Sofía did. - What? - She didn �t want to be alone with you. - Why not? - You �re giving her a hard time. - I �m having a hard time. Talk to a psychologist, or to me. Don �t take it out on a girl you met once. Did she say that? Did she say that? - Bitch! - Come back! Whiskey and Coke. - What whiskey? - What did you say? What whiskey? Why don �t you ask me to my face, son ofa bitch? Ballantine �s. - Same again. - No, this one �s on me. - Why? -Just is. Fix your face, man! - Hello. - Hello. - Where were you? - Around. Pelayo went to look foryou. And I came to look foryou. Why? To- - No reason. To buy you a drink. - Want a drink? - No, thanks. Can you tell I �m elbowing in? The thing is, I �ve got a problem. A girl �s chasing me, and I need some help to get rid of her. Shit, shit, shit! She �s coming this way. She �s coming this way. Don �t look. Don �t look. You carry on talking, act as if he weren �t here. I mean, as if I were here. Keep talking. Tra-la-lee, tra-la-la. What a lovely conversation we �re having. So that �s it, here we are... having a bit ofa chat about life. That �s enough! Where the hell were you? Around. I �m leaving. I �m tired. You two stay ifyou want. Well, this is where I leave you. - I �ll see you home. - No, I live very close. - I �ve got the motorbike. - No. - Don �t be silly. - Lay off, Pelayo. She wants to go on her own. Shut up. You �re drunk. I might be drunk, but I �m not an idiot. - Anyway, I �m not drunk. - Really, you needn �t bother. - As you wish. - You �re the one who �s drunk. We �ll call you to meet some other day. All right. We could go to the movies. - You hear? - Great! Well, that �s it, then. No, don �t kiss me. You might get poisoned by my drunken breath. Well, we �ll meet up soon. Sure. We �ll meet up soon. It �s not cold. Well... I �m gonna have to go. Where are you going? I �vejust remembered my bike is back there. - I �ll go with you. - No. Why? You �re almost home now. - See you tomorrow. - Pelayo, wait a minute. What? I don �t know. You drank too much. We �ll talk tomorrow ifyou want. - Tomorrow I �ll wish I were dead. - You won �t. You just need to rest. Pelayo! You �re my best friend. Son ofa bitch! Openyoureyes. César. It �s me. Sofía! - What are you doing here? - Forgive me. Why? I love you. Come on. - What �s wrong? - Nothing. I still can �t believe this is really happening. Where �s Pelayo? I don �t know. He went with you, didn �t he? Yes. Ofcourse. Come on. God, what a sensation! Ofwhat? Do you ever feel you �ve lived something before? Yes. Why is that? They say it �s a lapse in the brain. I �ve been here before. It usually goes away after a few seconds. I don �t want it to go away. You �ve made use ofyour time. That �s all there is here. Very pretty. Is it Sofía? How much longer will I be here? No one ever knows that. Even my worst nightmare was never like this place. It �s a psychiatric penitentiary. No more, no less. - I shouldn �t be here. - You �re accused of murder. - I don �t even know what I did. - Tell me something. -Does the name Eli mean anything to you? -Eli? You know a girl with that name? No. Why do you ask? It seems you kept repeating it last night. I guess I was dreaming. - What did you dream? - I can �t remember. - It could be important. - How could it be important? Look, I can prove you didn �t know what you were doing... but first I have to find some explanation for all this. There is no explanation. I told you the other day. What did you dream, César? I don �t know. I only remember bits. First, I �m in a kind ofoffice. A secretary shows me into another office. There �saphoto ofa sunset anda man. Then, idon �t know. - Theyshowme lots ofpapers. - Whatpapers? ldon �t know. But lsign them. Does the office belong to your company? No, I don �t recognize it. You dreamed ofa place you �d never been? Yes. That happens a lot, doesn �t it? Are they the papers you signed with the doctors? No, what happened with the doctors was surreal. - Why? - They rang me to go to the hospital. When I arrived, the whole surgical team was waiting. Formonths, those faceshadlookedat me with indifference andimpotence. Nowthey were allsmiles. Thesame bastard who hadsaidmycase washopeless talkedabout an operation. Theyhada newrevolutionarysystem in the clinic now. Theysaidthat within two weeks my face wouldbe completely reconstructed. You didn �t believe them? Not at first. I thought it wasjust a way to get more money out of me. But they showed me all the gadgets for the operation. It lookedlikescience fiction. Alllcouldsee were cables, switches, monitors. Actually, lneverreally knew what they weregoing to do. But lthought I �dnothing to lose. Thosepeople were usedto rhinoplasties... liposuctions, hairtransplants, but my operation wasmuch more. ln less than a week... my life hadturnedaround. One night, I waslying on thegrounddrunk, waiting to die. The next morning, my dreams were coming true... like in the movies. Sofía loved me, and the doctors found the miracle cure. I don �t know. Obviously, I was suspicious. Suspicious? Ofwhom? Ofwhat? I don �t know. In life, you never know. Happiness comes when you least expect it. I once knew a guy who was alone in the world. Suddenly, he was married with two daughters. Fuck, you �ve got a strange idea of happiness. Well, that depends on the individual. What �s happiness foryou? What �s happiness foryou? Don �t ask any more stupid questions. But at that time, you were happy. Or weren �t you? So what? My life now is shit. All I can do is eat, shit, sleep and dream of my memories. It �s good that you remember. - Well? - Well, what? They were to remove the plates today. - And they did. - And? Well, my ears are where they should be. César, don �t scare me. - Take offthe plates. - You can do it. How did they do it? Wait.Just to say that I love you. You �re going too fast... considering we met yesterday. Yesterday? My birthday, don �t you remember? I met an incredible girl. Her name was Sofía. But today I woke up feeling great... and now I �m with the girl again. What is it? What is it? Ifyou want me to move, you have to put in a coin. Ting! We neverappreciate thegoodmoments tillthey �re over. Maybe that �s why they �regoodmoments. - We don �tstop to thinkabout them. - Perhaps. What happenedto Pelayo? - What �s up? - Hang on a minute. - That �s it. - About time. - Want anything else? - No, thanks. How �s things, Pelayo? Fine. How �s things, Pelayo? Fine. Yeah. I �m actually not as fucked up as I look. I �m used to you always winning, you bastard. - And Sofía isn �t that great. - You said she was ideal. Really? I was drunk. Anyway, we �re friends. Bastard! - What �s that on your face? - What? - Fuck, there �s a seam opening! - What are you on about? You fucking idiot! What �s the matter? I hate dreaming. You �re tickling me. What �s wrong? What is it? - Where �s Sofía? - What? What have you done with Sofía? - I am Sofía. - You bitch! - You �re mad. You �re mad. - Where is she? In one minute, I �m going to call the police. You �ll be in trouble ifSofía doesn �t appear. So you survived the accident. What accident? - Whose body was it? - I didn �t have an accident. No. It wasn �t an accident. It was attempted murder. A pity you didn �t see my face, bitch! - Why do this? How have I changed? - You haven �t. You �re the same lunatic who gate-crashed my party. I �m the girl you made love tojust now. I �m Sofía. Stop saying you �re Sofía, do you hear? Don �t say her name! You won �t tell me where she is. You never will. César. I love you. - Hello. - Hello. You can go. I �ll see to this. Right. Let me get this clear. - Where were you last night? - At home. I told that gentleman. At home. With whom? - With a girl. - The girl just questioned? No, that �s another girl. I was with Sofía. The girl I spoke to was Sofía. Yes, that �s what she says, but it �s a lie. - Who is she then? - She �s Nuria. Nuria what? I don �t know. She never told me her surname. Let �s see. You were at home with a girl called Sofía, and suddenly-- I go to the bathroom, come back, and she �s in Sofía �s place. Where �s Sofía? Ask Nuria. She �s pretending to be her. You don �t know her surname? But who do you believe, her or me? Listen, that girl �s papers are all in order. We �ve let her go. - You �ve what? - And I assure you she �s called Sofía. Sofía Cueto, and she lives at number 2, Quirós St. - No! - No, what? Well, yes, but that �s another girl. I know the real Sofía. Then tell me where she is. Because, legally the girl you �re talking about... only exists in your imagination. - I don �t believe this. - And another thing. The girl looks as ifshe �d been hit. She was in my house supplanting my girlfriend! I don �t know why, but she wouldn �t press charges. Fucking great! So now she �s the victim! Tell me. Are you on drugs? - God! - You were under psychiatric care. My face was destroyed in a car crash she caused! Your face looks fine. Because-- It doesn �t matter. I �ve got nothing more to say. Young man. I �d advise you to see a psychiatrist. Are you an idiot? - What the fuck is this? - What do you mean? Ifyou wanted to fuck her up, there are other ways to do it! - Keep away from Sofía! - It isn �t Sofía. It �s Nuria! Nuria �s dead! Calm down, oryou �ll be sleeping in a cell tonight! Don �t ever talk to me again! I don �t know what the cops told you, but Nuria is alive! The cops didn �t tell me, Sofía did. Listen, you spoke to her by phone, didn �t you? - Let go! - It wasn �t Sofía. Nuria can imitate her voice. She took her ID, her apartment. It wasn �t over the phone. I �vejust dropped her home. She looked like this. Nice photo, isn �t it? You going to say that isn �t Sofía? But that �s-- Is this a joke or what? You �re crazy, man. I �m crazy? I �m crazy? You �re the ones who are mad! You �re all mad! Let go of me! God, what �s happening? It �s my partners, right? They �ve paid you. This is a plot! Look at yourself. You haven �t been right since the accident. Fuckyou! Are you saying-- Are you saying this is the girl you ran after the other night? - Is this your ideal girl? - Yes! And you took her. You need a psychiatrist! Problems? I �m in no mood, sojust-- There �s an explanation for all this. César. Who are you? - You �ve seen me on TV. - What do you want? I �m here to help you. First ofall, it �s very important that you calm down. Calm down? You must overcome your fears and regain control. What control do you mean? I �m fine. Who says you aren �t? They do. All ofthem. They think I �m mad. No, ofcourse you �re not mad. But what if I told you you were dreaming? No, no, no. Why not? - I know what �s real, and this is real. - How do you know? You discoveryour dreams when you wake. I just know. - My dreams are much simpler than this. - No dream is simple. Look at those people. They seem to be talking about their own business. Completely unaware ofyou. And yet, they could be there because you wanted it. What �s more, you could have them at your complete service... or have them destroy you. I want them to be quiet. And you, too. See? What �s going on here? Someone tell me the fucking truth! The truth? Maybe you couldn �t take it. It had to be a setup, a bigjoke to drive me crazy. They all knew. Nuria, Pelayo, the police, the guy at the bar. - Who was he? - I don �t know. You said you saw him on TV. On what program? I don �t know! I don �t know. One that talked about freezing the dead. - Freezing the dead? - Cryonization. Like they did to Walt Disney. Maybe I can help you remember. Is that a threat? Lie down. What �s that? A syringe. Relax. My arm �s stinging. It �s a tranquilizer. What for? These things are all bullshit. Ifyou �d trusted psychiatrists more, you mightn �t be here now. That finger, it �s making me nervous. You needn �t be afraid. - I �m not afraid. - Stop talking and concentrate. Come on. Fuck. I feel dizzy. Good-bye, César. Verygood. Nowlet �ssee ifyou can tellme about that dream. - ln my dream, it isn �t raining. - The office dream. Eli. That �s it. I wantyou to tellme who Eli is. -A secretary. - Eli isa secretary? She tellsme togo in. They �re expectingme. Who �s expectingyou? - The Frenchman from the TV. - Sit down, please. It �sa contract. - Eli-- - César, who is Eli? You won �t regret it. Sign. - What areyousigning? - Eli willsee to everything. What haveyousigned? What �s wrong? What �s wrong, César? Whyareyou crying? - l �mgoing to die. - You �re notgoing to die. - ldon �t knowhowmany. - Howmany what? - Pills. - You tookpills? - Howmanyshouldltake? - Pills to feelbetter? ldon �t want to. When lcount to three, you �ll wake up. One. Two. I thought that, up to now, you �d told me the truth. What do you mean? You said you took nothing. César, I �ll askyou for the last time. - Did you take drugs? - Fuck! Why does everyone-- Stop playacting. Tell me the truth! - I must know what you took. - I didn �t take anything! Don �t you see? Your brain could have been affected by the pills. - I didn �t take any! - You said you did! It �sjust a dream! Why make it more important than it is? Can �t you tell dreams from reality? I can! Really? Don �t make me laugh! Bodies that come to life, people who disappear... you, the Phantom ofthe Opera! Tell me one thing. Do you remember what you did to Sofía? It wasn �t Sofía. I don �t care who it was. What did you do to her? You remember? My God! What are you doing? I thought you were a burglar. Who are you? I �m Sofía. Sofía. You �re not Sofía. César, this will all be over soon. We �ll be together again. You �ll forget Nuria and I won �t be afraid ofyou. - I �m thirsty. - I �ll get some water. Sofía! Yes, César, I �m Sofía. I �m Sofía. I want to see you. I want to see you. I want to see you! I want to see you! At times you dream you �re with someone. For example, your father. In seconds, he becomes your mother... and then, the news vendor on the corner. Yet you still feel as if you �re talking to the same person. You thought you were at home, but suddenly you realize you �re in a school. Or a hospital, or a prison. Dreams are like that. And at times the mind behaves as if it were in a dream. - You know what derangement is? - For fuck �s sake! Say I �m stupid ifyou want, but this isn �t derangement! Then what is it? You tell me, because I don �t know. I don �t know what �s in here, or why you killed your girlfriend. I don �t know who Eli is, or that man from the TV. - I don �t know anything. - That makes two of us. Will you still come after the trial? Don �t you hate the sight of me? - What will you plead? - Why do you ask that? The first hearing is next week. Temporary derangement. It �s your best chance. Even so, it won �t be much use. They won �t believe me. Even I don �t believe it. What do you believe? I thinkyou �re very sick and should stay here for a long time. Don �t worry. I �ll get at least 20 years. César, you may not believe it, but I care about you. I care a lot about you. Look, kid. Your case interests me. I �m sorry about what �s happened. I even thought someone was playing tricks on you, but... I can �t and mustn �t exceed my duties. - I �m just a psychiatrist. - You don �t look like one. - What do I look like? - My father. Preaching at me all day. Your father �s dead. There you go. By the way, what happened to that man with the wife and two daughters? I don �t know. I never saw him again. Take my advice, get a lawyer. Good-bye, César. Good-bye. ...the main Spanish investment, but certainlythe most novel. ...its economicpresence in Cuba. ...depending on the era. ln the Roman Empire, forexample, the normalthing was to live... only25years. Who �s got the remote? Give it to me! Get it off him! What �s up? There �s a computer here connected to Internet. They �ll only let me use it ifyou come with me. - Why do you want Internet? - I know what Eli is. Wait! Eli isn �t a person, it �s a company. - How do you know? - It isn �t Eli. It �s L.E. They �re the initials ofan American company. - What are you doing? - Checking the "initials program." It �ll tell us all it knows about L.E. Shit! - It �ll take ages. - No, wait. Fuck! I feel like I �ve done this before. A cerebral dysfunction. A lapse in the brain. No, not this time. My God! - That �s it. - The photo in your dream? I had to see it before I could dream about it, right? "Cyronics." - Cryonization. - I �ll print this. Wait a minute. I don �t see what this has to do with your case. The key is in here. Look, there �s an office in Madrid. I �ll go and check it out. No! I have to go, too. - I can �t get you out of here. - I �d be let out under supervision. Make up some excuse. - It isn �t easy. - You can do it. You know something else, don �t you? I don �t know anything. - I �vejust got a feeling. - What is it? I have to go there, one way or another. Let �s get things straight. We �re outside, I �m armed. Myjob is to stop you doing anything stupid. Try anything, and you get a bullet. I �ve been here before. - This way. - Move. You �ve got 20 minutes. It �sjust like in my dream. Good morning. Can I help you? Well, actually, we wanted to speak to Mr. Duvernois. He �s my son. He �s very shy. Mr. Duvernois isn �t here right now. But, first ofall, do you know what cryonization is? Well, more or less. Here are some leaflets. You can read them while you �re waiting. One of my colleagues will be with you soon. Thankyou. "Live without limits. Tomorrow is for the foresighted." What is this? Some kind ofsect? "Cryonization is the biostasis or preservation of human beings. It is the bridge to carry our patients to a future... when technology will restore them to life." You pay to live eternally. They laughed atJules Verne. César, all this is absolutely impossible. What do you know ofthe future? They promise what the Church has always promised. Immortality. Except they �re quacks, not priests. How are you involved? You �re not cryonized. You �re alive. This is the contract, ifyou want to look at it. The procedure is very simple. You could die at any time. Today, tomorrow, in 20 years. It doesn �t matter to us. At the very moment you �re declared legally dead... Life Extension transfers your body to our store in Arizona. There, it �s frozen at minus 78 degrees. We call that "total suspension," and it costs $240,000. 30,000 pays for the freezing process, and the rest... goes into an investment fund... the interests from which pay for maintenance... and resurrection costs, the day that it �s possible. If it is possible. We believe that the reanimation ofthe dead will be possible. - What �s this? - What? Clause 1 4. Artificial perception. It �s a concept that we haven �t fully developed yet. Look. This is a life. Birth and death. Let �s say you �ve got a terminal illness. Ofcourse you want to go on living, but not in the future. That doesn �t interest you. You want to live your life now. Very well. You die, we freeze you... and when we can resuscitate you, we �ll have you live... a dream. - A dream? - It will all look real. Your family and friends, your city... the world, even this office. But it �ll be a virtual reality. What �s more, we �ll make you forget that you �ve died... and that you signed this contract. - How? - Very simple. Wiping it from your memory. You �ll live your life linearly, as if nothing had happened. And best ofall, you �ll live it as you like, as you wish. You �ll decide at all times. But what ifthere were mistakes? What ifthe dream was transformed into a nightmare? Well, the subconscious can always play a dirty trick. But we �re not cowboys. This is a serious company. And virtual reality technology is constantly making huge advances. Look. I �ll be honest. Signing Clause 1 4 is like signing for paradise. It �s hard to believe. But they laughed atJules Verne. Excuse me. - Where are you going so fast? - To the bathroom. - Well, not so fast. - I �ll go with him. Hejust felt ill, don �t worry. César, calm down, please. This is a dream. It �s the only explanation. What he said is impossible. In the 20th century, but maybe not in the 30th. - Maybe not, but we �re in 1 997. - That �s what it seems. - I paid for it to seem like that. - Listen! Ifthis is a dream-- Look at me! Ifthis is a dream, it means that I don �t exist! - I just imagine you. - No! - César, I �m real. - How do I know that? Can �t you tell a dream from reality? Is this a dream, eh? Tell me, is this a dream? César, I �m wearing myselfout over this case. There is no case. I didn �t kill anyone. It �s all a nightmare. Fuck it, César, trust me! This isn �t a dream. - They got it wrong. - Who? I don �t know! But they mixed up Sofía and Nuria! I see a face that isn �t mine. I �m sick of hearing that! Your face is fine. You �re behaving like a child, hiding behind that mask. - Go on, take it off! - I don �t want to see myself! I don �t care about that. I want to see you. Don �t you realize? All that matters is what I see! It �s my dream! Say that once more and I �ll have you locked up in an asylum. Show me your face. Now. You owe it to me. César, look in the mirror and tell me ifyou thinkyou �re disfigured. God! Why do you keep seeing what isn �t there? - You look fine. - I �m a monster! What do you mean? Anybody �d like to have your face. You look normal. Notjust normal. You �re handsome! César, listen. Maybe you �ve got something like anorexia. Some girls insist they �re fat and end up crazy. César! I want to wake up! I want to wake up! - Hold it! - I want to wake up! Fuck! Shit! - Freeze! - Don �t shoot! This is a nightmare! It �s a nightmare! You! Wait a minute! You �re not to leave! Stop! Wait a minute! It �s a dream! It �s a dream! Don �t move! Drop the gun! - I want to wake up. I want to wake up. - Don �t move! I want to wake up! Antonio. Antonio! What? You �re crushing me. I �d better not move. I �ve been shot in the back. How do you know? Well... because-- What �s going on here? What the fuck �s going on? I told you, it �s a dream. Shut up! Shut up! I know what this is. It �s one ofthose Candid Camera jokes. You did a greatjob, I loved it, but enough �s enough! - I see someone. - Where? Up there, on the roof. I can �t see a thing. Where are you going? Come on, Antonio. Don �t think about it anymore oryou �ll go crazy. Hello, César. It �s time I introduced myself. My name is Serge Duvernois. I represent Life Extension. We met... 1 50 years ago. What? Has the world gone mad? There �s no world. It �s all in that gentleman �s mind. Including you and me. Sure! Shall I thump you to see if it hurts? Try it. They can make you disappear right now, like everyone else. - And who are "they," may I ask? - The company. Life Extension. They know everything we �re saying. They know what is going through César �s mind an instant after he thinks it. Ifthey can make me disappear, why haven �t they done it? It would be virtually incorrect. You �vejust saved his life. Virtually incorrect? Do you think I �m an idiot or what? No, quite the opposite. You �re a great guy. A character who is very necessary for César. A character? - Where are you going? - To look for someone. There is no one. People aren �t necessary now. Why didn �t you wake me before? You only had to ask. But that was difficult. Because, in theory, you wouldn �t know you were dreaming. Since when? Remember the day ofthe discotheque? That night, whenyou fellasleep on thesidewalk... was the one chosen forthesplice. Whatsplice? Thesplice betweenyourreallife andyour virtuallife. A splice of150years whichyou didn �t notice... becauseyou were dead andfrozen. From whenyou woke up... nothing wasreal. We wiped what really happened from your memory. What was it? You never saw Sofía again. And the doctors were never able to rebuild your face. You woke up on thatstreet with an awfulhangover. Youshutyourselfaway formonths. One dayyou learned that we existed. You came to the office, yousignedthe contract... andthen... you killedyourself. lpaidforthis? I paid for Nuria to come back as Sofía? I paid to look like a monster again? I paid to live this nightmare? You paid to live whateveryou wanted. Wejust provided the setting and the characters. You invented your hell. I tried to warn you in that bar. I said it all depended on your mind. Do I just have to want it? - Can Antonio come-- - There �s no one here. They can �t have made 4 million people disappear! You �ve overcome your fears. Ifyou want, we can try again... have you live a wonderful dream... with money, friends, Sofía, or whatever girl you want. You just have to ask. I don �t we emerged from our world of fantasies. We are Indian girls. The lovers of our dreams and our husbands are not the same. Someone else chooses our husbands for us. We learn to love them. "This is the truth and the sooner you realise it, the better." "Don't make this mistake, Anjali." "Someone, somewhere is made for you and you should wait for him." Perhaps he is the one. I believe that this is the one who was made for me. And I'm going to live through with this belief. And who knows? This might happen to you. Tomorrow you might marry a man whom you merely know... and slowly you might realise that he was the one you were waiting for. Nothing like this will happen to me. I'll choose my husband myself. "This is impossible, Rahul. There can't be a girl like this." Meaning? - lt's a meaningless character. Maya exists only in your dreams. Modern girls aren't like this. What do you know? You're not a girl. "Stop it, Rahul. I'm serious. Modern girls..." Maya is not one of these modern girls. She's different. She is my Maya. "Your Maya, indeed! What do you know about girls?" You know only one. And that's me! What do you mean? I don't know anything about love... and yet I make love stories. What of it? "Rahul, your Maya is really crazy." Don't you call my Maya crazy! And you are the only one who feels this. Nobody else is saying anything. - Definitely! "Rahul, I think Nisha is right. - Thank you." I don't understand 'Maya' either. Her character seems false. Looking at it from a psychological point of view... I'm sure that you're on your own trip. On a fantasy trip. "l'm sorry, Maya is not in." Do you also want to say something? - l think we need a lunchbreak. Exactly! See? - l don't know... if such a girl exists or not... and I don't want to know. "Whether she is a lie, a fantasy or mad or whatever..." That is Maya. "lf you cannot understand this, I'm very sorry, I can't help it." But under no circumstances am I going to change the character of Maya. Excuse me. - What's this! I think Rahul's right. You shut up. You are Rahul's yes-man. - l was only saying that.... Okay... what were you saying? Do you know of such a girl? is your Soni like this? - No. You figure the character of Maya? - No. Should we do this play ? - Never. "That's exactly what I've been saying! - Right, but..." Not again! "That innocent face" "The mischief in her eyes" "Oh my!" "That innocent beauty, with mischief in her eyes..." "stands afar shying away" "Oh my!" "For a fleeting moment she shows herself and then turns away" "lf you look with my eyes, friend, you can see her" "She's no ordinary girl, she's a wonder" "How else can I describe her?" "Last night I dreamt of her... her hair flowing wildly" "When I woke up, I wished I could go back to my dream" "lf this how I feel without meeting her,..." "what will happen when I do?" "Dark as the monsoon clouds is the kohl in her eyes" "Her gait has the grace of the waves in the ocean" "Wonder what HE used to create her body" "l wish she appears before me out of nowhere" "Rahul, how do you like this? Hold this." Perhaps you haven't noticed but everyone is staring at us. So what? I don't care. - But I'm looking funny. Oh come on. How do you like the orange? Very nice... - l'll be back in a moment. Shopping? - Yes. Alone? - Yes. Very good! Never make the mistake of going shopping with a girl. "How d'you like it? Cool, isn't it? - You like it?" I like it very much. - l love it! Let's go. Once you've tried it on. - Both of us like it... let's go. To hell with Rahul! So sweet! - What did you say? "Nothing, nothing at all. Off you go!" Who is it? - Aw... sorry! Okay? Happy? Why are you laughing? What's up? - Where are your jeans? I'm wearing it... lt happens. Who's there? Crazy! Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Everybody clap... Open the cake box. How did this happen? What happened and when did it happen? How did this get swapped over? I had ordered a chocolate cake. You picked up someone else's parcel. - l'm so stupid! I should've checked. "l'm sorry, uncle. - lt's all right, dear." Other people celebrate their birthdays by cutting a cake. I'll celebrate mine by cutting sandwiches. No big deal. Let me see who got my cake. Who's this Pooja? - l don't know. And who's this uncle? - Must be Pooja's uncle. "First time I sent you out, and you end up picking the wrong parcel." What have I done? I brought the parcel the shopkeeper gave me. But you should have checked. - Excuse me... "but it wasn't up to me to check. Next time, do it yourself." I am hungry. This cake looks really good. Stop it. No one's eating this cake. - Why not? Because it belongs to someone else. - They must be eating our sandwiches. There's an address written here. It's nearby. Go and deliver it. Are you mad? "This is someone's birthday cake, ordered with love." Someone's party will be ruined. Go and give it back. I'm not going. Damn Rahul! "Jimmy, let's go and give it back and say 'Happy Birthday! '." So sweet! - What did you say? Nothing. Yes? "Good evening. Are you uncle? - No, I'm aunty." "Actually, by mistake I got your cake, aunty." The sandwich man! - That's right. Here's your cake... wishing you a happy birthday. Thank you and sorry. Why sorry? - Because I've eaten your sandwiches. "That's all right. Actually, I ate a bit of your cake on the way here." No wonder...! "Okay, I'll be off Uncle. - No. Come in and have some cake." No thanks. I'm in a hurry. Some other time. "Just a minute. Just one minute, please." "Let the person who bought this cake, thank you." "There's no need. - No, no!" "That poor man, whose sandwiches you picked up by mistake..." has brought the cake back. - How sweet! He's at the door. Go and thank him. The cake has brought a twinkle in my eyes... and a musical rhythm to the strings of my heart. Strange man. Why are you buying all these stuff? "Oh, Anjali... Today is Valentine's Day" What is this 'Valentine's day'? - Don't you know? The man you love most in the world is called your Valentine. "On this day, all lovers let their hearts out to each other." This is all about love. You won't understand. Very funny! But whom are you buying all these things for? For myself. - What? "You see, I don't have a lover who'd buy me all these lovely things." I'm doing this for my own pleasure. - You've gone quite mad. "Do you know, today isn't an ordinary Valentine's Day." It falls on the same day as the full moon. Know what this means? "l don't, but I'm sure you're going to tell me." "lt means that, if you believe that someone is made for you..." "and you are waiting for him with a true heart,..." you will certainly meet him today. - And you really believe this? Of course. I'm absolutely sure... that before midnight I shall meet my soulmate. Pooja! You're really mad! - That I am. "Damn Rahul! I'm going home. lf you want to come with me, then come on." "Rahul, we all came together and we'll all go together." "This is a very boring party. lf you want to come, then come on." "Rahul, you don't get any better." "Look, how beautiful is the night... and you're so unromantic." "Look, everyone's so much in love." You think that they're all in love? Of course. - Sit down. "Tell me something, Nisha. You think you know what love is?" "Love is when you're so fond of someone, that your heart tells you..." you want to spend the whole of your life in his arms. That's what we call love. - l see. You think the people here... want to spend the rest of their lives with each other? I think so. - Girls are so daft. "Do you know, most of these romances will be over before tomorrow?" They'll fight over small things... and will never see each other after tonight. "And next year, you will see the same faces,..." at the same places in different arms. "Boys are also really stupid. - l'm telling you the facts, Nisha." You must realise that you need to know someone really well... to spend your life together. - That's right. And in order to know someone well you need to spend time together? "True. - ln today's times, who has the time?" "Look; among all these party guests, no one's known each other..." for as long as we've known each other. Does that mean that we can spend a lifetime with each other? Let me put it this way. Will you be able to spend a lifetime with me? "Here you are, Rahul. And everyone wants you outside!" Why? - Everyone wants a song from you. "Oh no... - Oh, come on!" "Tell me, will you be able to spend a lifetime with me?" "Yes Rahul, I can." I could spend my whole life with you. "The moon whispered something..." "which the night heard..." "The moon whispered something, which the night heard" "Did you hear,..." "lt said, fall in love" "Fall in love" "The moonlight came..." "to my street and to my house, to say..." "fall in love" "What can I say, what can I do?" "This strange thing that has happened to me" "lt is a sign or did my heart whisper..." "fall in love" "l can't explain, but I am certain that there is someone" "He is somewhere in my dreams, but I cannot see him" "l am here... he is somewhere there" "But who is this who says..." "Fall in love" "l could die for him, yet he is oblivious" "But I can't complain. I cannot call him unfaithful" "l can hear him... even though he is yet to speak" "O my heart, be careful..." "when you fall in love" Hello? - Are you mad? Are you out of your mind? How can you return just like that? You said we had come together and we'd all leave together. Then you run away all on your own. You know that we're all worried. Idiot! Stupid! Fool! Hello? "This is not 6 7 1 1 2 3 7, is it?" No. - l thought so. "l'm sorry, I thought it was someone else." You're right. I am someone else. I'm really sorry. Please excuse me. "lt's okay. - Thank you... hang on, one minute." "Don't hang up, please. - Yes?" The music you're playing... "that's Pundit Shiv Kumar Sharma's new album, isn't it?" Yes. - l thought so. "You know, I wanted to buy it. Where did you buy it from?" From Rhythm House. - l haven't been there. D'you think they'd have it in stock? - How would I know? "l'm so stupid. How would you know? You don't work there, right?" I'm really sorry about all this. It's okay. - Good night Good night. - l'm really very sorry lt's okay. - Happy Valentine. Happy Valentine. Nice voice. "Ajay, you idiot!" How dare you do this to me? You scared the hell out of me! Now I'm not going to give up until I've got you. Stop! How about it? Cut it! "Ballu! What are you up to? - Why, what's wrong, Rahul?" The spotlight should move from me to Nisha after the drum roll. I told you And I thought... - Shut up. "Come on, Nisha... do it again. Let's take it from the top" Rahul... - Damn Rahul! What is it? Please pack up early today. - Why? What's special about today? "Nothing. Come on. - C'mon, let's take it from the top." "Rahul, you forgot? Today is her birthday." Really? Why didn't someone tell me? "Nisha, what's wrong with you? Why didn't you tell me?" "There are some things, Rahul, which one knows without being told." Even then... you people should have said something. "Honestly, you guys are the limit..." Rahul! Just relax! - l'm very angry. You've been forgetting all these years. This is just another year. Stop putting on an act and take us all out to dinner. Come on. "Come on guys, let's go. - Nisha..." What is it? Happy birthday. You remembered...? Why didn't you say it? There are some things which one knows without being told. "You idiot! Thank you. - lt's okay, Nisha." Let's rehearse! "Just joking. Come on, everybody." "Okay everybody, Tequila time!" What are you guys drinking? - Tequila. I want some. - This isn't for ladies. Have Pepsi. "No, I want some. - l told you! This is not for you!" Today's my birthday. - Happy birthday. Thank you. I'll do as I please. "Okay, suit yourself. Give me another glass." So sweet. - What...? Nothing. You're in love? Give over! I know your kind of love. It changes every week. "This is your kind of love, not mine. - You mean, the marrying kind?" Really? Who's the girl? Do I know her? "Really well. - Tell me who she is, please!" Must I? - Shoot! Forget it. That hurt! Okay! One... two... three... go! Didn't I tell you? It's not for ladies! One more! Damn you! "Please, Ajay! Tell me who she is!" Right then. We'll do this. See that waiter? Which one? - The one serving water. Keep looking at him. lf there's still a glass of water on that tray... by the time he gets to our table then I'll tell you her name. Promise? - Promise. Okay. "Oh my God! Excuse me! A glass of water, please!" That's cheating. You can't do that. Everything is fair in love and war. Thank you! - Everything is fair in love and war. You idiot! Nisha please... Nisha! "Nisha, shut up!" Shut up now... hush. Don't say anything. Say nothing at all... "Take my shoes and give me money. - Please... go to sleep, Nisha." Go to sleep. Good night. "l'm afraid, Rahul. Don't leave me I'm scared" It's really late. Now quietly go to sleep! Good night! First promise me that you won't leave me. "Okay, baby, I shan't leave you alone." "You won't leave me, even if I ask for an ice-cream, will you?" "No, I won't." "You won't leave me, even if I don't dance well... will you?" "No, I won't." "Not even if I call you names... donkey, monkey... will you?" "Of course, I won't." "You won't leave me, even if I tell you that I love you... will you?" "l love you, Rahul." "l really love you, Rahul." I love you. There she is... still asleep! "Come on, Pooja! It's seven in the morning!" "The sun is up, Pooja." What the hell...! You...? You idiot! is this the way to wake someone up? "l'm so sorry, but seeing you fast asleep, I just couldn't resist it!" How could I miss out on such an opportunity? "You idiot! Stupid! - l'm sorry... sorry, sorry" "Listen, get ready quickly. We've got to go to the airport." Airport? Are you going somewhere? No. We are going somewhere. "We? And where are we going? - Well, that's a surprise." "lt's not far from India, it's very near." We'll return by tonight's flight. Get ready quickly! I can't figure. What are you saying! - Silly! It's very simple. I have to go on some business. It will take me just an hour... just sign some papers and then I am free. "lf you come along, you'll see a new city as well as do some shopping." And anyway I am leaving for London tomorrow. That leaves only today... which I want to spend with you. So simple. "But Ajay, I must find out if it's okay with Uncle and Aunty." I've already got their approval. It's only you who has to decide! "So fatty, are you coming or not? - Of course, I'm coming!" Then hurry up and get ready. The flight is on time. Wait a minute.... What's that under your eye? Where...? "Now wait, you fatty...!" Never mind. I'll get you for this. - Come and get me. "You're going shopping, aren't you? We'll see!" "The heart is crazy, the heart is mad" "The heart is crazy, the heart is mad" "The very first time lovers meet..." "it sets their bodies on fire" "Very slowly it teaches love..." "it makes them laugh, and it makes them cry" "The heart is crazy, the heart is mad" "lt keeps them awake all night..." "it steals the sleep from their eyes" "lt shows true and false dreams,..." "it makes them laugh, and it makes them cry" "Those who follow the heart..." "are known to be crazy" "They discover their destination..." "but cannot find the path" "l don't need to see his face..." "l don't need to know his name either" "l don't need to think or worry..." "because my heart will know him" "We all listen to what the heart says,..." "the heart doesn't listen to anyone" "l've given my life to him..." "yet everyone knows, but he" "So be it, give up these stories..." "and all these signs of madness" "All people's worries are..." "all thanks to this crazy heart" "Well, Ajay sahib,... it's time for you to go." Now I have to go. - Did you say something? "Pooja, I want to tell you something. - Tell me. What is it?" This quick business trip of a couple of days was all a pretence. I came here for something else. It's been eight years since I left India. "l've earned enough of respect, money ... life has been too hectic." I want to settle down now. And whenever I close my eyes... to think whom I would like to spend the rest of my life with... it is always your face that I see. I don't know how or when my feelings for you turned to love. But I don't know anything about your mind. Or if there is anyone in your life or not. That is what I came here to find out. I don't know what you think about me. I don't even know if you would want to spend your whole life with me. But I know for sure that I love you and I want to marry you. I'm going towards the departure gate. Once I've got there I'll turn round and look. "lf your answer is yes, then you'll be standing here." And if you're not here then I'll understand. "And one more thing. Don't forget that whatever your decision is,..." "we were friends, we are friends, and we'll always be friends. Okay?" "And who knows, tomorrow it may also happen to you." Perhaps you will marry a man whom you only know ... but whom you don't love. Then you will realise later that he was the man... for whom you were waiting. What? But why did you keep standing there ? Sometimes I'm so happy when I make someone else happy... that I can't think of anything else. "You should have seen his face, Anjali! He was so happy." I have never seen him so happy ever before. "And your happiness? You don't love him, Pooja!" Love? Love will happen in due course. And we are Indian girls. We can't choose our life partners. Someone else chooses our life partners for us. We learn to love them. Isn't that true ? At last you have left your girlish dreams and become a woman. "No, Anjali. The girl has become a woman,..." but she has not given up her dreams. "She believes in them completely, even now." She is sure that Ajay is the one for whom she was always waiting. "Perhaps, it was HE who was taking His time to show her." I'm certain that Ajay will make you very happy. I hope so. "What happened, Nisha? Take her to the doctor, hurry!" "Slow down, Rahul. We're almost there." Get a stretcher. "Hi, doctor... - There's no need to worry." It's a small fracture. She'll go home in a week or so. I told you Nisha would start dancing again in a week. "l'm talking about going home, not dancing. She can't dance..." for another three months. - Three months...? "Yes, Rahul. Her heel is very delicate." If she doesn't take care then this fracture could recur... and it could be more serious. Does she know this. May I see her? Of course. You don't need my permission. "Thank you, doctor. I'll see you guys." Whose going to get me a cup of tea ? God! You won't learn to knock. Don't give me a lecture. I have something very important to discuss. "Yes, tell me. - Can you see me properly?" "How many fingers? - Stop it, Rahul." "Okay! See, your Doctor Kapoor isn't up to much, in my opinion..." Get a check-up with another doctor. - Why? This doctor was talking about getting you discharged in a week. "So what? - No, it's not done." It's been difficult getting you admitted into a hospital. You should spend at least a month or two in here. "And while you are away, we'll also have some peace." "Rahul, I hate you! You're so horrible!" You're always making fun of me. I hate you. You're so bad! "Nisha, behave yourself. Sorry, nurse. She has gone mad with the pain." "But don't worry, I'll take care of her. I'm a psychologist." Yes? - l'm sorry. For what? I've put you to so much of trouble. You've taken all the money from the sponsor... and how will you get a dancer so quickly? "And for three months, I.... - Now look..." there's no need for you to worry. Damn Rahul! Why do you think? You're a good dancer? In this town there are many such dancers. "Sure, but you'll never get... - A dancer like you, right?" Right. - Now you don't worry about this. You have a nice rest and I'll come see you in the evening. I'll bring some food. We'll eat together. lt's a deal. Bye. - Bye. "l know. Chinese, right? - Right." Not to worry. lt will all work out. - How will it all work out? We've taken money from the sponsors and paid a deposit for the stadium. "And most of all, where will we get another dancer like Nisha?" "Come on, if we try, don't you think we can find one good dancer?" There are plenty of dance schools. One is close to our rehearsal hall. "We'll find a dancer there tomorrow. - Yes, yes!" "You're right. How about that, Rahul? Come on! Relax!" Whatever happens will be for the best. Let's go and have some cold beer. "You go ahead. I'm not in the mood. - Come on, buddy!" "Lay off, he's tired. Come on, let's go." Take care. - Let's go. Maya... I'll find her. "Water, water..." Excuse me... The sandwich man! Shanti... has a parcel come here by mistake? I haven't come for a parcel today. - Then tell me what I can do for you. I want to meet your daughter. - l don't have a daughter. No daughter? - No. "Then sir, this Miss Pooja Malhotra...?" Pooja is like my daughter. But how do you know her? I saw her last night. - Night...? Where? - ln the dancing school. She dances beautifully. - And so? "So, I wanted to meet her. - What for?" I want to ask her something. - What do you want to ask her? "Sort of, would she, with me... - With you... what?" If she wanted to work with me. - What work? I do plays. I'm looking for a dancer - You are doing a play. Yes. Are you a director? - Yes. I am sorry. I am sorry! Why didn't you tell me before? "l said so, when you asked me. - l am sorry. Come on." "Actually, I am a singer. - l see." I've done years of practice. Sit. "As it happens with many great artistes,..." you really don't meet many connoisseurs. You've met me today. You don't know how lucky you are! "l know, sir, but I have come to meet Pooja." "Now that you have met me, you will meet Pooja, too!" "l won't give you more than 75 bucks. - 80 bucks, no less." Only last week I bought it at that price. This is the right price. Taste it and see how sweet it is. I will give you only seventy-five. "Show me the watermelon. - Here you are, sir." "Seventy-five is the right price. How many do you want, Madam?" Just one. - Pack this for Madam. But... - Oh come on! It's your first sale in the day. And you're haggling for 5 bucks! Be a sport! Hi. - Hi. Recognise me? We met last night at your dancing school. Remember? "Oh yes. - l'm, Rahul" You must've heard of me? - No. "Well, never mind. Actually you are a pretty good dancer." "Actually, I'm doing some music shows and I need a special dancer..." for a special role. When I saw you dancing yesterday... I thought that you would be ideal for this. So what do you think? Would you be interested? "No, thanks. - l've had it!" "Sir, watermelon! - Dammit! My career's at stake!" "Excuse me, but perhaps you misunderstand me." I'm talking to you about no ordinary show. It's a very high-class show with a very high-class audience... and I am sure you will also enjoy doing it. Why don't you try it once? "Not for me, for the sake of art." Dancing is my hobby. - That's really good. But I am afraid of dancing on stage in front of an audience. Why are you afraid? - l don't think I can do it. I'm sorry. - No... problem. Excuse me... I'm sorry. "You see, I'm really in difficulty. Actually, my lead dancer..." has fractured her foot. I've already taken all the money for the show. "lf we don't perform, I'll suffer monetarily, I'll also lose face." "Come just once for a rehearsal, and if you don't like it, it's fine." "But please, just once. Please come to the rehearsal." I'm really very sorry. I can't do it. "You'll have to take someone else. - l beg of you, please!" What are you up to? ! - You don't know me. I'm stubborn. I'll not go until you agree. Please come just once to a rehearsal. "Everyone's looking at us. - Please... please come, just once!" I'll come. - Promise? Promise. - When? What time ? Two O'clock. - Can you come at one ? "Okay, I'll come at one. - Thank you very much!" "You know that we are neighbors, don't you?" I know. - Thank you very much! "Ma'am! You'll come, won't you Ma'am?" "Yes, you will!" Yes? For you. He's mad! "Rahul, you said that girl would come at one o'clock..." It's four now. I don't think she'll come. "So what should I do? So if she doesn't come, won't we do our play?" I was only... - Go and get on with your own thing. "Okay, relax." "Ballu, put the spotlight on the entrance." Hi. - Hi. You must've heard of me? "Cut it! No, no!" "No Pooja, no! You are not dancing with abandon." You are concentrating more on the steps and music. I don't want to see how well you dance. I have already seen that and you are very good. I want to see whether you are Maya or not. I want to see the extent of Maya's love and abandonment. I want to see what happens when Maya dances wholeheartedly. Right? We'll try it once more. "All right, music!" Cut it! Why don't you understand what I'm trying to tell you? Forget that anyone's sitting here. Forget that the music is playing. Forget that this is a rehearsal. Just think of Maya. I don't want to see you dance. I want to see your madness! Maya's madness... "l'm sorry, Pooja. - Don't touch me." "l'm really sorry, Pooja. I was just..." Never in my life has anyone spoken to me in such a way. "l know, Pooja... but I'm an idiot. I don't know how to talk to girls." "l told you, I can't do it." But you're doing it really well. I am going on about this Maya. I don't understand this Maya. - Never mind... I don't want to do this. - Don't worry if you don't understand. We don't have to do this today. We can do it tomorrow. Okay? I don't want to do it tomorrow either. - Okay. "Maya, relax. - My name is Pooja!" "Of course, it's Pooja." "l'm sorry... sit down, please." "l'm really sorry... Pooja, if you don't want to dance, then don't." But please stop crying. Don't want water? No problem. "You see Pooja, it's my way to yell during rehearsals." I wasn't having a go at you. I was only trying to explain to you about Maya. "Pooja, perhaps you didn't understand Maya." Maya is the kind of girl who lives in a dream world. She believes that one day her dream prince will come and carry her away. Her friends have always made fun of her... but that did not shake her belief. "And today, she has met the man of her dreams..." and she is dancing. There is intense love in her dance and madness and a certain arrogance. "As if to say, "l knew he would come and now, see, he has come" "My dream man has come" Music! Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant "Nisha, I can't believe we got such a good girl so quickly." "Had I not got the right girl for this role, I'd have cancelled the play..." "given back the money, and willingly faced the music." But I was destined to meet Pooja. "Her name is Pooja? - No, it's Jeetendra." Of course it's Pooja. is she beautiful? - Really beautiful. Remember how I used to describe Maya? She's just like her. "That innocent face, those dreamy eyes and that bashfulness." "She is too good, Nisha, she is brilliant!" is she a good dancer? - When she dances... you can only keep looking at her. I know that... you will go crazy when you see her. - l see. But can she act? "What? Of course, she can. lf she can't act, what am I for?" If I can get you to act I can get anyone to act. Very funny. "There's no water, no soft drink... and you've called me for dinner." Wait a minute and I'll bring some. is she as good a dancer as me? Are you crazy? There's no dancer as good as you. Right. Right. Idiot. Can't even lie properly. Torn! The stitch... "May I say something, Pooja? - What?" "When you laugh, you know... - l know that I look good." When you laugh it starts to rain. "With the gait of a horse, with the majesty of an elephant" "O King of the Rains, where are you from?" "l know a girl, when she smiles,... it rains" "l know a boy, when he sings, it rains" "The clouds have descended..." "They have blocked our path" "Tell us what your intentions are..." "will you not let us go home?" "There's rain ahead, a storm behind" "The weather is treacherous... Oh, where can we go?" "The sky has lowered..." "Everything has come to a standstill" "How lovely is this season of shadows" "Take it as the sign of the times" "ln such a weather, say something..." "...do something! Why do you stand silent?" The doctor has said clearly that you can't go out of the house. There's no need for you to strain yourself trying to get up. Now settle down quietly. Whom are you phoning the minute you've got here? "Oh yes, he called to say that he's at Soni's house." "At Soni's? Oh yes, today's Soni and Jimmy's engagement." "Aunty, get my clothes out quickly. I want to go there." "Look, I'll phone the doctor. - Aunt, please!" She just won't listen! I hate these weddings. I don't understand why people get married. If two people have decided to spend their whole lives together... why are the others making such a fuss? Why are all they getting excited? These days it has become fashionable to have seven days of ceremonies... "and merriment at weddings. Forget it, buddy." "Get married, have a quiet ceremony and then go home and sleep." I've even come to hate the word 'marriage'. "Excuse me, may I have another?" But the one good thing is that in all this fuss... you get lots of goodies to eat. Have you eaten? Later. - Let's sit. I really love weddings. "The different small ceremonies, dancing, singing, and making merry..." they're what I love. - Very good. I'm going to have all of them at my wedding. Are you getting married? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? When are you going to do it? "Actually, nothing's fixed yet. He works abroad." When he comes back then... we'll fix a date when we've found an auspicious time. That's why I haven't mentioned this to anyone. I see. Congratulations. Thanks. "Rahul, when's your wedding with Nisha?" Nisha and me? Have you gone mad? The two of us are just good friends and there's no chance of us... "ever getting married and in any case marriage and me, no thank you." "Actually, I don't believe at all in these wedding ceremonies." I don't know how a person decides to spend his whole life with another. I fail to understand and I'm certain... There can't be a girl who could spend her whole life with me! You're mistaken in your thinking. There is such a girl. Where is she? - Somewhere or the other. Rubbish! "l believe that in the beginning, God made all the relationships." But then HE left it to us to find each other. HE created us all as couples. For every one of there is a soulmate. You just have to wait till you meet her. Do you think this is true? This is the truest thing in my life. True! That means that you have met your soulmate. Yes. I have met him. Something's amiss. - What? The ice cream's good. Have some. - No. Nisha! When were you discharged from the hospital? I ran away from hospital. - Great! Jimmy and Soni... will be delighted to see you. - Where are they? "Over there, go and meet them. - Rahul is there, isn't he?" Rahul's gone to drop Pooja home. Thanks. See you tomorrow. It's that story you told me at Soni's. "That some special girl is made for me... etc, etc..." I've been thinking about that. I didn't understand something. - What? How will I know who's made for me? You have such faith in this theory that you must know... how I am going to meet this girl also. "l mean, will she be wandering about with a board with my name on it?" "Or, when I see her will there be a clap of thunder and a bolt of lightning?" Or will music start to play? What will happen ? "HE will tell you, HE will give a sign..." and your heart will realise who the girl is. I've even reasoned with her... but she doesn't listen. She does what she wants. - Hi doctor. "Rahul, it's good that you came. This girl has worried me." Why? What happened? - l told her clearly that... "she needs to stay at home to rest. But you see, she's packing her bags..." and getting ready to go somewhere. - Where to? How would I know? I've tried my best to explain. She doesn't listen to me. "Well, only you can convince her." "Don't worry, she won't go anywhere. I'll just go and twist her ear." Best of luck. See you. - Bye "What are you doing, Nisha? Have you gone mad?" "The doctor told you to rest, right? By the way, where are you off to?" I'm going to London. - London? "Well, Mum and Dad keep phoning me asking me to go to see them." Months have gone by. "l think I'll go to see them. Besides, I want to run away from here." Want to run away...? From whom? "From myself. - What's all this nonsense, Nisha?" "l've begun to get scared of myself, Rahul." "l want to go, to avoid committing mistakes, like I did one yesterday." "Nisha, you haven't done anything of the sort." You only danced. Look here... - Rahul... now we should stop playing hide and seek with each other. We both know what the problem is. What's the problem? The problem is that I love you and you don't love me. "Look here, Nisha... - l know..." that you know how much I love you. That night I wasn't so out of it... that I couldn't hear what my heart was saying. "Actually, Rahul, we have become such good friends..." that we take each other for granted. So I think that a bit of space will give us time to think. "But I am sure that when I'm not here, you'll remember me often." Then perhaps you will start caring for me. "One thing is certain, that an idiot like you..." doesn't deserve a girl like me. "And I don't why, but I feel that when I come back,..." you will be on your knees begging me to get married to you. And who knows at that point... I may not want to marry you. "Well, perhaps you haven't seen your face..." It's better than yours. Nisha... you're really nice. "l know. Come on now, I got say bye to everyone before going to the airport." "Come on, Rahul, hurry up." We haven't been properly introduced. Let's start from the beginning. Hi! I'm Nisha. I'm Pooja. "Now that we are friends, will you forgive me for what I did yesterday?" Forgive you? For what? "Pooja, what I did with you yesterday, wasn't right." "Actually, ever since this place was built,..." I'm the only one who's danced on this floor. This floor has become my trademark. So when I heard that someone else was dancing in my place... I felt bad. "Without seeing you or knowing you, I felt jealous." I shouldn't have felt that way. "Had I been in your place, then perhaps I'd have done the same." "Moreover, I really enjoyed dancing with you." You were the one dancing. I was doing something else. I am really sorry. - lt's okay "Come on, Nisha, it's time for your flight." I always told Rahul that there could never be another dancer like me. But I can't say that anymore. And I'm sure that no one can perform the role of Maya better than you. "Not even me. All the best, bye. See you." Bye. Hi. I'm Rahul. Perhaps you've heard of me? I'm looking for a special dancer for a special role. I saw you dance yesterday and felt you would be ideal for this. "Check, check... 69..." "Ballu, what are you doing? Angle the spotlight properly." "Pooja, good, good. But..." I think that you aren't dancing freely. I want to see how Maya looks when she's happy. I want to see the extent of Maya's madness and love. Okay? Do it again. Okay! Quiet everybody. Take it from the top! Music! Cut it! Cut it! "Haven't I told you to forget that you are you, to forget that.." people are sitting here. Forget that there's a rehearsal going on here. Pack up! "One thing I don't understand, Pooja." "How I will know which girl was made for me? I mean,..." will she be wandering about with a board with my name on it? "When I see her, will there be a clap of thunder and a flash of lightning?" "Oh dear, what's happening? I don't really know" "l only hope this does not turn into a romance" "Oh dear, what's happening? Nobody really knows" "But if this is a romance, then so be it" "Take my hand in yours, as long as you are here" "Let us keep talking, as long as we can" "Let's sit here looking at each other,..." "as long as the night remains." "What name can I give this season of my heart" "Even the dewdrops seem to burn, with the fever of my heart" "Why do I feel as if someone has caressed me" "Please go away for a while, so I can collect my feelings" "And quieten the violent beating of my heart" "Let's slow down so that we don't move ahead too fast" "There is something between us, don't deny it" "And if something further happens have faith in your feelings" "For you should know, your heart is not what it was" "Oh dear, what's happening? - l don't really know" "l only hope this does not... - turn into a romance" "Oh dear, what's happening? - Nobody really knows" "But if this is a romance... - then so be it" I hope your uncle will be asleep so I won't have to hear him sing. Bye. - Bye "Rahul, I forgot to tell you... - What?" I can't attend rehearsal tomorrow. - Why? Tomorrow I'm going to Khandala. - Khandala? Why ? My teacher lives there. - Which teacher? My dance teacher. She taught me everything I know. Tomorrow it's her birthday. "lf l say no, will you not go?" "l shall go, but if you say yes, I'll go happily." I'm joking. Go on. I'll rehearse with someone else tomorrow. Thanks. Bye. - Bye. I've had it. Rahul...? What are you doing here? I have a friend in Khandala. He's been inviting me for ages... but I've never had a chance to go. And since we can't work without you... I thought I'll meet him and give you a ride too. You've no one with you so I thought it'll be company for you. What are you staring at? Hurry up! If we go early we'll beat the traffic. "Well, why are you smiling ? - No reason." Let's go. - Today I'm really missing my friend. "Tommy, quiet! Quiet!" They won't do anything. I'll be right back. Stay here. "Don't worry, they won't bite you. I'll be back." Want some soft drink? "Sandhya, what are you doing? I'll give you a good slap." "Glutton, you have become so fat, you can hardly move." No chocolates or ice creams for you. Get it right this time. Move the neck. Arms straight. Why are you laughing? Close your mouth. If anyone gets it wrong then no one will watch TV tonight. "Don't come begging me again, Please Tai ! Please Tai !" Look! Here comes your dear Pooja! "Tai, how did you recognise me? - There's no need to act smart." I recognise all the girls from the sound of their steps. Happy Birthday to you! What's this? You've brought me another ugly sari. "Yes, I chose the ugliest I could get my hands on." Where you are going? The class isn't over yet. Now I'm here... the class is over. - You're spoiling them rotten. They behave well all through the year. And the day you come... they start misbehaving. - Sometimes one should be spoilt. Tai! Wait! Rahul is my friend. - Your friend? "Leave him, children. - Go on, children... go inside!" Why are you so frightened? Happy Birthday! What are you up to? ! - l'm trying to touch your feet. "Do I look that old? - No, but out of respect.." Give me your hand... - Pardon me? Your hand. Nice to meet you! "Come on, you've caught a cold. Come, let's go in." Save me from the dogs. - They won't hurt you. "Tai, who's he?" I don't know but I will have to find out. "Pooja, you didn't tell me what Rahul does." Rahul...he directs plays. Nowadays I'm working with him. I see. I think that you don't like Rahul specially. "No, I like him very much." Very much? "l mean, he's a good friend." Good friend? You mean you don't love him. "Tai, Rahul's just a friend. A dear friend." I see... a dear friend. It's not like you think and in any case I wanted to tell you something. There's no need to tell me. I understand everything. "Stop it, Tai. Tai, you've got it wrong." "Rahul, what's up?" Nothing. Why are you standing with the spoon? Come join us. Stupid! - Hey everybody! "Come on everyone, follow me... this way." "lf it's not love, then what is it?" "Tai,... honestly! - Look here, girl!" I've known you since you were twelve years old. "What your heart doesn't let you know, it tells me." The look in your eyes says that you love this boy very much. Now stop lying to me... okay? "Just a dear friend"... big deal! - Listen, Tai..." "l don't remember when this happened" "lt's become hard to hide this secret from everyone" "lf you say so, today I'll ask God for something" "Oh dear, what's happening to you? - Beats me" "l just hope this doesn't turn... - into a romance" "l see, so when is Ajay coming back?" Nothing is definite but he could come at any time. I'll be right back. "Pooja, give me your hand. - Why?" I won't hit you! Give me your hand. What's this? Listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you. Ever since you were a child... you have always considered others before yourself. I have always been overwhelmed by your behavior. But today you have made me sad. But I... - Quiet! Sometimes it's very important to consider ourselves. I see that you are running away from your dreams. You won't let them come true. Don't do this. Not everybody is fortunate to have their dreams come true. Don't do this. "Tell you something, one happens to fall in love many times." True love only happens once. You are failing to take the right step. Lord Ganpati will help you to do what is right. HE will give you the strength to fulfill your dreams. "Keep lt with you, always. I have faith in lt." "The Lord will set everything right. - l love you, Tai." Stop it! I don't make a habit of crying. Why are you frightened? - Pardon me? Why are you frightened of being in love? Tell her. "Love and me? I was just... - Okay, give me your hand." Nice to meet you. - Take it! "What's this? - This is, in a way, my blessing." I'm very mean in this matter. I don't give my blessing that easily. But when I saw you I thought that perhaps you need it. This will help you to say what you are unable to say... Keep it very carefully. You get it? - Got. "She is coming. lf you can't say it, then I'll say it..." I'll say it. Definitely? - Definitely. Mark my words carefully. Bye! - Bye "Bye! - Goodbye, sister!" "Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen... May I have your attention, please?" "Aunty, please... thank you." Since I am Jimmy's best man... I have the right to make a speech... and you all have to listen to it. "Until today, I didn't understand how two people can take a vow..." to spend their entire lives with each other. I didn't believe in these vows of marriage. And seeing Jimmy and Soni together only strengthened my conviction. Because there can't be anyone as innocent as Soni... and there can't be a scamp to beat Jimmy. I used to worry that Soni and Jimmy are too different... to spend their lives together. But today I realise that I was wrong. I am a little ashamed to admit that I have started believing in love. "The kind of love in which lips don't speak, eyes do." The kind of love that binds two people together forever. "And today, I keep thinking of just one thing." I remember something a very dear friend said:... that God predetermined all our emotional relationships... but then HE left it to us to find each other. HE made us all couples and for every one of us somewhere... there is just one soulmate. HE made Soni for Jimmy. Today I thank God for getting Jimmy and Soni together... and I pray that HE may give each one of us the ability... to recognise our own soulmate. Thanks. "Rahul, you are strange." Soni and Jimmy have made their farewells and you're still here. "l don't like farewells. - Okay, but drop me home, will you?" My bangle? "Rahul, have you seen my bangle?" Damn! Now I am sure I won't find it. It was my favorite bangle. "Mine, too." Rahul ! "Come on, give it to me." Come here and take it. What childish behavior! Give it to me! Come closer. Here goes... happy? Come closer. "Closer... - Rahul, stop it!" Closer... Closer... Closer still... Closer... "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something" "You say something, I'll say something, my love" "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something" "You say something, I'll say something, my love" "We would rather have died than reveal our secret, oh my love" "You were a few steps away from me, I was a few steps away from you" "Yet we may as well have been hundreds of miles apart" "Step by step our wavering hearts came together, my love" "Come, you have won me over and I am defeated by my heart" "Today with great difficulty my lips say 'love"' "Now I'm madly in love..." "don't ever leave me, my love" "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something" "You say something, I'll say something, my love" The set is ready. "Good, well done. Call Pooja." Okay. Shruti Call Pooja. "Pooja, we're ready." Are you angry with me? - Not at all. Then why aren't you speaking to me? - l am speaking to you. For three days I haven't seen your face or heard your voice. I was very busy. I have been calling you everyday. Why haven't you been answering ? The phone has been out of order for some time. What is the problem? Tell me. I want to know the cause of your restlessness. There's no problem. - There is a problem. Serious problem. The fact is that we both love each other very much. We can't tell each other about it. Today I've come here to tell you... that I love you. I love you very much. And I know that you also love me. "So then, say it once and that will be the end of your restlessness." Everything will be all right. I don't love you. - You're lying. I'm not lying. - You aren't? Look into my eyes and tell me that we weren't made for each other. We weren't. "Tell me that when I go away from you, that you don't turn to look at me." I don't. "Tell me, when I touch you nothing happens to you." Nothing. - Tell me... that you don't want to come into my arms right now. I don't. Look into my eyes just once and tell me that you don't love me. I don't... I don't... I don't! Terrific performance! Very well done! Nisha! Hi. - Great to see you back again. But I am sure that when I'm not here you'll remember me often... "and when I get back, you will be on your knees begging me..." to marry you. And then perhaps I may not want to. "Well, I'll be off." I'm a little tired. I'll see you all tomorrow. What's up with Nisha? - She's tired. She'll come tomorrow. Don't get unnecessarily worried. "l'm not a nice girl, Rahul." I'm bad. I'm really bad. "No Nisha, you are my friend." And no friend of mine is bad. "No, Rahul, you don't know that I am not a nice girl." "Now you see, I love a boy and have always loved him..." and today I realised that he doesn't love me. He loves someone else. "l feel bad, I'm hurt..." I'm upset. I feel jealous. "Rahul, I shouldn't feel like this. I am bad." "l am very bad. No, Nisha..." "No, Rahul." "Actually, that boy isn't just the one I love..." but he's also my best friend. "Today, for the first time, I saw love in his eyes." "l couldn't put love there in all these years,..." but that other girl has. Perhaps they are made for each other. Perhaps I was never meant for him. Perhaps her love for him is true. "So you see, I should be happy for my friend." I should revel in his happiness. But I'm not happy... I'm not! I'm very bad... really very bad. "Nisha, you are not bad, you are really nice." You know who is bad? HE is bad... THE ONE who plays around with us humans... "making A love B, while B loves C..." and C loves D.... I don't know why HE does this. When HE makes one person love another... then HE ought to make sure that the other one also loves her in return. Right? But that's not what HE does. HE's really bad. You're not bad. HE's bad. You're right... It's HE who's bad. HE's bad! YOU are bad. I am not. YOU are bad. I haven't done anything wrong. YOU are the one. YOU are bad. YOU are bad. "l'm sorry, Nisha." "Don't say sorry, Rahul. Else, I'll cry." "l'm sorry, Nisha." "Don't say sorry, I'll cry." Ajay... "when I was a little girl, you used to tease me about my dreams." When I used to tell you that I am looking for the one meant for me... you would say that I am mad and silly. You would smile and say that when I grow up... my dreams will vanish. "But you know, I have grown up and my dreams have not vanished." They have grown with me. "That day, at the airport, when you suddenly asked me to marry you..." at first I didn't realise what I should do. "But then I thought, I was crazy..." "you were my dearest friend, and the one who knew me the most." Who could be better for me. And I remained standing there. You left and I made you a part of my dreams. I started believing that you were the one made for me. And then... and then I met Rahul. Ajay! You're marrying Pooja? ! What are you saying? But Pooja hasn't said anything to me about it. I had forbidden her from telling you. I wanted to tell you myself. I can hardly believe you! I am so happy! When are you coming ? I called just to tell you this. I'm coming tomorrow. Tomorrow...? What can I tell you about Rahul? Where do I start? "Well, you should realise that I've never met anyone like him." "Sometimes he's an angel, sometimes a devil." Sometimes crazy... and sometimes a genius. Sometimes he scolds so harshly... and sometimes he makes funny faces to make me laugh. At times he's more stubborn than a kid and at times he's a beloved companion.. "ln three days? Oh no, I want time to get things ready for a big wedding." "Ma, I don't have time. The company is sending me to Japan for a year." You'll have to wait for eight to ten months. I can't wait that long. "All right, you come here and I'll start the preparations." "The dreams of your crazy girl have come true, Ajay." She has found the partner of her dreams... and she wants your permission to make all her dreams come true. Can she make her dreams come true? Ajay phoned just now. He's told me everything. "He's coming tomorrow, Pooja..." ...and he says to get the wedding organised as quickly as possible. You would tell me your smallest secrets... and you hid such a big one from me ? Come here... sit by my side. "You know, Pooja, ever since you came to this house,..." "l've had a dream in which, one day, you would become my daughter-in-law" And I your mother. "But I was apprehensive, I didn't know how the two of you..." would feel about each other when you grew up. Whether you would be friends and care about each other or not. "l also wanted that you should decide if at all because you wanted it,..." not for my sake. I wanted you to choose Ajay out of your own free will. "You don't know how happy I am, for l know..." that there cannot be better girl than you for my son. Just watch. I'm going to give you a grand wedding. You have no idea how happy I am. May you live long. I want full lights and I want to see M6 on both left and right of stage. "Supandi, in a while I want to hear the music tracks." "Soni, the elevation should be three feet higher..." or else the audience on stage right will not know what is going on. "When Ballu lights M6, one spot light will filter here on this side..." and the audience will get a glimpse of the entry before it happens. Hi Pooja. I need to talk to you. "The show opens in two days, we'll talk later." Show me all the costumes of act three. Go do some work. "l have to talk to you. - Pooja, just a minute." Okay... tell me what's the problem? "Rahul, please try and understand what I am about to tell you." "Rahul, Nisha is calling you. The stadium has called." I forgot to talk to her. I'll be right back. Where's Nisha? Rahul please be serious... Ajay...? "My name is Ajay, but if you like you can call me Rahul." Fatty! I love you! I really missed you. "Remember, I told you that I'd come to get you ?" Here I am. I came here after meeting mom. "She is so happy. Hey, I hope you haven't changed your mind?" "You're marrying me, aren't you?" Have you told your friends? - l was going to... "Hear that! I'll have to do that, too?" I'll tell them. Ladies and gentlemen... I'm sorry for the intrusion. You don't know my name: it's Ajay. I am Pooja's childhood friend. And since she hasn't found a worthy guy... I took pity on her and I am going to marry her. Congratulations! - Thank you very much. "ln three days we are getting married and you all must come, with family." "Pooja, you're weird. Why didn't you tell us before?" We had begun to feel that you were our Maya. We forgot you're Pooja and you have your own private life and your own relationships and even prior commitments. We are really stupid! trying to be helpful, alright? So... What's the story? - With what? - Popsy. What's her face? - Heather. - What's she still doing here? She's staying here for a while. She split with her partner, I asked her to move in. Yeah? What happened? Did she stab him? - Her. - Eh? - Her partner was her girlfriend. - She's a lesbian? Yes, not that it's anybody's business. Jesus. Well, what are you doing with her? She's just a friend. What? Does she work at the casino too? Hmm? Um, do you want sugar? Since when do I take sugar? [ Music Plays ] Good luck. - Hank, hi. - Hey. This is a surprise. Yeah. Well, things didn't quite work out with Rebecca. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Mmm. I think I overwhelmed her. At least the ego's intact. Have a nice evening. Lauren, are you booked right now? - No, actualy, I'm not. - How about a performance appraisal? I'm a pretty harsh judge these days. I'll take my chances. Come on. I think room two's available. Now, nice and slow, remember? [ Both Moan ] [ Both Sigh ] Was that worth an elephant stamp, or what? It's not exact science, Hank. There's always room for improvement. I'm glad we did this. There is something else I wanted to talk to you about. - Oh? - This place is for sale. What? And I have a group of buyers who are very keen. What do you mean, you've got a group of buyers? I'm a business broker. That's what I do. I'm acting for some potential buyers. Anyway, these people, they like the figures, but they don't really know the industry. So they're looking for some kind of structure that might include the workers. Like, say, if you and some of the other girls could... How much money are we talking? Well, it's like buying a house. You only need the deposit. The venture borrow the rest. And we become part of that venture. Yep. That's what they're looking at. What do you reckon? Well... Timing could be good for me. So why don't you ask around? Hmm? Do you always mix business with pleasure? No. But I will in the future. [ Musical Tone ] [ Mobile Phone Rings ] Hey. Where are you? Um, I'm busy. I can't explain right now. What do you mean you can't explain? Nick, the money's gone. What? I'll make the money back. I promise you I'll pay back every cent. What do you mean the money's gone? It's 300 fucking grand. Have you got a gambling problem, or something? - I have to go. - Hey, whoa, whoa. Hang on a second. You can't just dump this on me and then piss off. I just want my old life back, Nick. You know? Where no-one gets stabbed in restaurants. What has that got to do with anything? I'm sorry. I have to go. Mel, wait... How's it going, Dad? The tax figures stack up? Yep, they stack up. Right up our arse. But you can cover it, right? Hey, you know what? Just fucking back off, will you? I've got enough shit going on without you adding to it. OK. It's about owning a piece in this place. It's an opportunity to become more than the workers. I mean, that's why I called you in, Chloe, to see if you're interested. Yeah, I just have to think about it. Well, we kind of need to act fast. You know, Nat should be in on this. She's really good with money. I can't believe she didn't tell us about it. She must've known. Well, not necessarily. I mean, Nick's a devious bastard. - What about Mel? - Not answering her phone. Don't look at me. She hasn't been home for weeks. OK. Well, I'm interested, but I'll let you know. - Alright, see you, girls. - ALL: 'Bye. I just don't understand how we're meant to raise all this money. Tippi, it's as much as you can put in. We don't have to all be the same, as long as we come up with 10%. We got 10% of the business, we get 10% of the profit. And we all know how much this place makes. I really like the sound of that. You know, something on the side while I'm being a mum. - Mm-hm. - I have to think about it. OK. Well, as soon as you decide, let me know. I have to get the paperwork organised. - I've got a client. - Yep. - You know, you're very sexy. - Hmm? You. When you take charge and talk about money. It's very sexy. - Heather, I'm not a lesbian. - What? I haven't... I'm not attracted to women. Sexually, or any other way. I'm not gay. Oh. Neither am I. I just love pussy. - Now you're making fun of me. - Yeah. You're being a dickhead. Nat, how much money are you holding for me? Uh, there's a bit there. Why? Um, can you give me a ballpark? Tippi, I'm busy. I'd have to look it up. This is really important, Nat. - Why? - Because I need to buy something. Can you put it on your credit card? I really don't have time right now. No, I need a minimum of $10,000. - Want to tell me what this is about? - No. - How much have I got? - I don't know, Tippi. I'm not getting paid to be your accountant. Yes, you are, aren't you? So what do you think? It'll be a way of staying in the business without maybe having to work. Is that what it means? Well, maybe. Eventually. I've been thinking about something else. - I want to buy the Salmon. - The what? Black Salmon Studios. Is that wise? You always tell me studios don't make money. Yeah, I know. As well as recording facilities, the Salmon's also got rehearsal rooms. So you're always got money coming in. Do you have that kind of money? Well, it's doable. I've been getting a fair bit of ad work lately. And I was thinking maybe you might want to come in with me. Are you good with money, Josh? I don't know. Are you? Yeah. Yeah, I think I am. I don't suppose you, uh had any thoughts about my other little idea? You'll be the first to know. Alright, cool. Hold it like this. That's right. - How does it feel? - Mmm, good. - Is that good for you? - Yep. Now steady, and take a step and... What the hell is going on here? Oh, shit. Oh, whoa. Do you know this person? I'm his wife, you cheap whore. Oh, hey, hey, hey. I am not cheap. You lying bastard. You have sex with whores. No, she's a... I was helping her with her kicking. Jasmine! Ow! Jasmine, cut it out! I'll cut it out, alright, and I'll kill you. I'll kill both of you. Um, I'm just gonan leave you guys in there to talk this to talk this through. You know, some of us are actually working here. Hey, listen to this. Mr Yuan's victory in the ballot was a shock, as pre-selection was expected to go to Les Danzenick, the popular local man. What? - Petey won. - Our rubber-loving friend. And new local member. He's cancelled all his appointments. I wonder if he's wearing his rubber undies in this photo? You know, it's obvious why they want him for parliament. He'll just rubber stamp everything. Hi. Nat, how much do you think this place would go for it it was sold? I don't know. The fit-out alone is expensive. Why? Apparently, it's on the market. One of my clients told me. It's gossip. I wouldn't take any notice. He seemed to know what he was talking about. Would you be interested in buying a share in this place? I would make that decision if and when it became an issue. So I don't know, do I? Would you excuse me? How'd you find me? - I bribed your driver. - Achilles? Mmm. I suspect he thought you might like to see me. I'll sack him for that. Come in. Should I ask, uh, why you're not at home? It's a long story. You want a tea or a coffee? Vodka? How about an answer to my proposal? - I'd like to book you. - What, now? You've had a fair while now. I didn't realise you were in such a rush, Tim. Mmm. But the answer's no. I can't do it. - Really? - Really. I'm not gonna sleep with you, Tim. My life's screwed up enough as it is. Oh. Well, that's a shame. Because I was hoping we could spend one last evening together. You watch too much daytime television. Mel, I'm getting married. Yeah, right. So what's her name? Actually, no, I don't want to know. I'm sorry, Mel. I should've told you before. No, no. You have now. It's just that I thought you already knew. Every magazine on earth's been snooping around. I don't read any of that crap. Haven't for years. Especially nothing written about you. You know, I think we should skip the wine and go straight for the brandy. Except, or course, I don't actually drink brandy. Mel, can you just... can you just calm down a second? Just stop a minute, OK? - I'm fine, Tim! I'm fine. - Yeah, sure you are. Tell me what's bugging you. Nothing to tell. Corkscrew. Ah, bingo. So, you want one more for the road, huh? That's one way of putting it, yeah. Screw-top! [ Laughs ] Here's to me. Drinking the profits? Yeah. Yep, that's it. So you're selling the place and, as usual, I'm the last to know. Who told you that? I'm not selling the place, Nat. Just... exploring the possibilities. And if I do there'll be something in it for you. [ Laughs ] You gonna look after me, Dad? Yeah, of course. I never wanted you here in the first place. I'll be out of a job. You're a natural. You'll get another one, easy. I don't want another job. I love this place. I love the girls. I love the clients. I love every sick weirdo that walks through that door. You might be on the papers, but I'm the soul of this place. And you, you just treat it like a personal lolly shop. The money, girls... I've never been involved with anyone before. You know that. You love her, don't you? It happens. You like a handful, don't you, Dad? So... It's come to this. I'm not done yet. I'll drink to that. Cheers. I can't. Can't what? I can't not do this again. I can't imagine it. Shh. It's true. It's true. That's good. - That's good. - [ Gasps ] You used to stay here when we first met, remember? So it's absolutely certain. - Hmm? - You, getting married. Oh. Any last-minute regrets? So who is she? - Victoria Cameron. - Victoria? Oh. - The Western Australian Camersons. - Mmm. That's good. At least she's bringing something to the table. - Well, her father is. - It's all tied up in trust. Just make sure you watch your back. There'll be a prenup. Just another deal, Tim? No, I really like her. Good. She certainly gets around. She's everywhere. I hope not. Um, can we not talk about this right now? Sure. Whatever you want. Will you tell me one thing, though? And you have to promise to tell me the truth. I was never in the running, was I? That's not a question that means anything. Come on, it's OK. I was never even in the ballpark. Mum, don't lie to me. They want you to go back to work. No, they don't. It's not gonna happen. Well, I think you should. I don't think you should have to give up just because of me. - Is that right? - I love that you're a prostitute. But what would I know? I'm asleep. I don't even know what we're talking about. [ Goat BAAS ] [ Goat BAAS ] [ Gasps ] - Hey, hey, hey! - [ Sobs ] - Stop, stop, stop! - [ Continues Sobbing ] Stop, stop! - Are you OK? - No. What's happened? Josh, I think my brain's gonna explode. Why? I just had a dream about when I ran away from home. You know, with that truck driver. Baby, we've been through this. I knew what I was doing. I did. But at the time I thought this is an improvement on anything else in my life. Because the rest was a total disaster. Come here. That's why I did it. Because I wanted a life. I know. And then this nun came into work the other night and I spanked her. - Right. - And all I could see was me spanking myself as punishment for what I do. You have to stop being so hard on yourself. And I keep seeing goats. I know. You keep talking about them in your sleep. It was the first thing I saw after that truckie. This goat, just staring and judging me. I don't care what you do. If you want to go back to work, you go back to work. And I'm not gonna hassle you about that. Come here. Come here. Shh. Do you really want to get married? Yes. But not to somebody that thinks I'm a goat. No, seriously. If I went back to work, would you still want to marry me? Are you gonna make me wear a suit? You look great. Yeah. I feel it. - New phone. - Yeah. Smashed the other one. Alright. Well, that'll explain it. Why I haven't able to reach you. I'm really sorry about the money. Don't worry about it. 232's on the market now. Shit, is that my fault? It's mine, for not paying my tax. I will pay back every penny. I will work twice as hard as I've ever worked, I promise. Is that where you've been, Mel? Working? - No. - Then where? I've been in a hotel trying to figure out who I am. - By yourself? - Why the fuck does that matter? It matters, OK? It matters. I'm sorry. I made a mistake. - Oh, shit. Mel, don't. Don't! - I'm sorry. - Will you not... - Stop it, Mick! OK. Money's gone, alright? I don't care. If you think this is about money, you don't know me. I need you to talk to me, Mel. Give me the full picture. I need to know where I fit in. You're getting married. Are you cool with that? Yeah. Yeah, of course I am. Except? Except what? Except, Bonnie, I can read you like a book. Well, that means you'll be my stepfather, right? Yeah. - [ Laughs ] I guess so. - Well... You're not gonna get all stepfather on me, are you? Like yell at me to do my homework or ground me or tell me what boys to go out with? Um, that last part... yeah, probably. OK. Well, I'll just tell you to fuck off. - But you already do that. - That won't change. Fine. Are you OK with me not being so cool, not a rock star anymore? - Were you ever? - [ Laughs ] Ouch! What about if I became an accountant? Would you love me any less? Yeah. Mmm, I would too. I hate accountants. [ Laughs ] - I love you, though. - Mmm. - What the hell are you doing here? - I want to talk to you. - Sorry, I'm busy. - No, listen. Please, listen. I need you to help me. I just want to know why. I need to understand why my husband comes to you for sex. Do you have sex with him? Yeah, of course I do. - Do you like it? - [ Laughs ] Why wouldn't I? He's Trent Davis! He won the club's Best and Fairest last year. it doesn't last very long. That's how Trent likes it. What am I supposed to do? You need help from a professional. Remember, it's a game of four quarters and you just play it out. The result's the result but it can't be the focus and take each kick as it comes and never, ever, ever look at the clock - just find the zone and stay there. Oh. Stay there, Trent. Just stay there. I'm not going anywhere, babe. Not a chance. Good. Never sorry about being an undersized player. It takes all types. Er, try something different. Oh, I love your game, Trent. Confidence and surprise are always your best attacks. Oh! Oooh, Trentie! Good. And remember to keep trying. - Do it over and over and over. - Baby! - And over again. - [ Both Pant ] - Oooh, yes! - Oooh! - Oh, yes! - [ Laughs ] - I love my job! - [ Both Moan ] PHIL: End of an era. Where do I sign? Down here and there. No regrets? Don't get me going. When does it go on the market? Tomorrow. That quick? Must be under the pump. Oh, just doing business stuff and the new domestic situation's not exactly cheap. You heard from the kids? Yes. Kate phones me every day. - Really? - Mmm. Ash not so much, but when he does, we talk for ages. How do you think they're doing? They're living in America, Phil. What can I say? Well, I'll get us a couple of drinks to celebrate. [ Phone Rings ] Hello. How much money have you got? Sorry? You and your syndicate. I was wondering, is there room for me? Well, yes. Yes, there is. Does that mean I'm in? Absolutely. That's our 10%. That's great. OK. Um, I'll give you all the details at work. 'Bye. 'Bye. Phil. Oh, we're having a private conversation in there so... Cool with me. How's the hand? Yeah, it's fine. I should've just gone for the heart but I didn't know if you had one. Yeah, right. You know, I thought it was a cliche but it turns out to be true. What's that? All you people - you hate men. All my people? Yeah, Lauren told me. You're a lesbian. Oh. Is that a problem for you, Phil? [ Laughs ] I don't care but this is my house so I really don't need the whole anti-men thing. I'm in Lauren's house and I'm not anti-men in general, Phil, I'm just anti the really dull, controlling ones. You know, why don't you get a dog, get a haircut? Put on the uniform so we know what you're all about? Why don't you have a midlife crisis and run away with the secretary? Oh, wait - you've already done that! You don't know what you're talking about so shut your mouth. Maybe take the kids too - really hit your wife where it hurts. - Jesus! Don't touch me. - Oh, s... [ Screams ] - Phil! - She fell over the bloody stool. You alright? Oh, shit! Shit! For Godsakes, Phil. She's pregnant. I am so sorry. It was Ally who wanted to do this. But they become part of you so quickly. Yes, they do. I should think of a name to honour the baby. I need a name. Yeah. Come here. [ Sighs ] How is she? She's asleep. [ Sighs ] You're lucky she didn't call the police. I had no idea. How could I? So it would've been alright to assault her if she wasn't pregnant? - You told me she was a lesbian. - So? You don't expect lesbians to be pregnant. She's also a sex worker, if you want to know everything. She works in the same place I do. Yeah, right. I'm serious, Phil. That's what I do for a living. I work in a brothel. And one that's actually OK and I'm gonna buy a share in the place when this house is sold. - You're a prostitute? - Sex worker. Took me a while to get the hang of it but somewhere along the line, I got the hang of it. I stopped being, what did you call it? "A dud root." And now people pay me ot have sex with them and yes, I'm OK with that and apparently I'm very good, if demand is anything to go by. Do the kids know? We shouldn't have to burden our children with everything, now, should we, Phil? This is disgusting. Absolutely bloody disgusting. I think you've cornered that market, Phil, all on your own. Yeah, yep. What? [ Clears Throat ] Can I call you back? OK. What are you doing here? I have a proposal for you. Victoria's due here in an hour. That's OK. Won't take long, I promise. [ Clears Throat ] What is it? I need some cash. What's it for? Oh, you could call it a going-away present or you could call it keeping you and me out of the papers. You wouldn't dare. What am I talking about? Of course you would. How much do you want? I didn't come here to blackmail you, Tim. Honestly. I just have a large financial problem and I thought you could help me with it. How much? Well, how much am I worth? I beg your pardon? [ Laughs ] You're an extremely wealthy man, Tim. You should know how much things are worth. [ Laughs ] OK. Er, can I write you a cheque or do you need cash? Cheque's fine. [ Sighs ] You know, it's traditional in most cultures for the bridegroom to receive presents, not to give them out. [ Laughs ] Oh, we've never been traditional. No, I guess not. This is yours plus a little present. It's a decent-sized cheque. Yeah, it is. Where'd you get it? A little windfall so I wanted to give you back what's yours. Plus I don't want you to sell 232. I want us to be partners. I don't want your money, Mel. Why? I don't know where it's been. What if I told you it was a going-away present? That I will never, ever see him again? Why should I believe you? Then don't. Like, what does, um, he get out of that? He gets to keep his name out of the papers. - No shit? - Yep, no shit. I earned this money, Nick. Every single cent. And behind that pseudo-gangster bullshit of yours, you actually know its value. What, and you'd give up working? Yeah, I would, if you'd give up the knives and the tax evasion. We'd run a legitimate business. Both of us. Hands-on. You know, we could do this, Nick. We could really try and make this work. Yeah, and what about us - aside from the business? Well, if you promise to stop stabbing people, I'll go house hunting for us. Hmm. If you ever see this bloke again, I'll stab you both. Several times. [ Laughs ] I'm thinking about a house with a garden. What, are you crazy? Yep. [ Knock on Door ] Heather. Alex is here. Go in. Thank you. Thanks for coming. Well, I charge double for outcalls. I'm sorry. He or she would've had beautiful eyes. And no hair. [ Clanking ] [ Banging ] Hello. Who's there? Whoever it is, I'm armed. - Natalie. - Peter. Jesus! Are you trying to scare me to death? - I've got something for you. - [ Sighs ] I can't think of anywhere else I'd rather be. Me neither. [ Sighs ] Josh. Josh. Hey. Joshua. Joshua Jason Phillips. [ Screams ] [ Giggles ] OK, OK, OK. Stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Mmm. Oooh. - Mmm. [ Kisses ] - [ Laughs ] - Are you making breakfast? - No. - Yes, you are. - [ Laughs ] I want toast and coffee. Hey, guess what? I slept like a baby. And I want an omelette. [ Groans Softly ] No goats, no nightmares. Mmm, tomato and onion. In fact, not a single goat to be seen. Melted cheese and some ham. [ Laughs ] - Listen to us. - Hmm? - We don't need to get married, Josh. - Mmm. We're already there. [ Laughs ] Hmm. [ Birds Chirp ] We're here today to acknowledge baby Jessie. Conceived with hope and carried with love. A tiny miracle that reminds us about the fragility of life and dreams. [ Cries ] Some things are not meant to make sense. Some things are just sent to remind us to to live and to care and to love. Thank you for inviting me into your life. [ Sniffs ] That will always be the sweetest gift. I really think you'll be excited by this property. It truly is something a bit special. Yeah. Oh, look, Nick's running a bit late. Sorry. Hmm. - Do you want to take a look around? - No, no. I'll wait, if that's OK. Sure. No rush. [ Laughs ] Yes, Hank. No... Yes, they're all here. I will tell them. [ Sighs ] Our offer's been submitted. We're about to become partners! - [ Laughs ] - Whoo! Hey, Alex. - Can you take a photo for us? - Sure. Yeah. Come on. Quick. [ Laughs ] ALL: Cheers! [ Women Laugh ] De Luca. [ Groans ] So what sort of work do you do? I was an escort. Right. Now I'm a brothel owner. I think I'll ring him again. Yeah, sure. [ Dials ] [ Phone Rings ] [ Groans ] [ Phone Rings ] [ Phone Rings ] Captioned by Grantman Brown [SHOWER RUNNING] [HUMMING] - Aah! Jeez, Justin. - I'm sorry. - How long have you been there? - A few seconds. - I was listening to you hum in there. - Do you know how creepy that is? - It's not creepy. - No, I'm serious. I gave you a key, but next time maybe you could knock, ring the doorbell, give me a little warning? [PANTING] What? I love you. Becca, I do. I... I love you. Wow, Justin. Thank you. I better go get dressed. Radio interview at 10, more election predictions. - Okay. - Then the call about renewable energy. - What's the tracking on that today? - Up four. - Excellent. - Oh, speaking of what's on the ballot, - I prepared a statement against Prop 8. - I'm already on the record against that. I know you've been here a week, but the senator released his position on the act four months ago. No one remembers four months ago. People are paying attention now. - Look, we realize this is your issue. - My issue? The Supreme Court of California ruled it is illegal to discriminate against gay marriage. Now, forgive me if I'm wrong, Robert, I thought you Republicans were all about respecting State's rights. He's got you on that, Stu. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Sorry to interrupt you, senator. Your 2:00 got pushed to noon. - Tell them he's busy. - No, no. I have to be at that. I agree with Stu. We've already released our statement on Prop 8. We're not coming out again. - No pun intended. - Yeah. I'm gonna take the interview in the car. And tell him about the other. [DOOR CLOSES] - All right, Kitty's brother. - You can call me Kevin. When you start referring to your boss as "senator," I will. In the meantime, talk to this reporter from the Sacramento Tribune. He's threatening to publish some cockamamie story about Governor Kern and the senator involved in some sort of intimate relationship. - What kind of intimate relationship? - The schtupping kind. - The story is he's schtupping her. - I know what schtupping is. That's ridiculous. Isn't it? Let me know how it goes. MAN: No, I agree with you, you know? [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] - Excuse me. Hi. - Hi. Wow, I just... I can't believe this is actually happening. I mean, of course, it should've happened ten minutes ago. - Do you think anything's wrong? - No, no. I'm sure she's just still in her appointment, and she'll be here as soon as she can. Well, I hope she's not lost. I mean, this hospital is like a maze. You know, Robert, I think we should've brought her a gift. I mean, maternity clothes are insanely expensive, and she shouldn't have to pay for that all by herself. - This is just her first visit. - She's our birth mom. She's probably young and might not have a lot of money. We're gonna have plenty of time to, you know, shower her with gifts. [SIGHS] You're right. You're right. Thank you. I'm... You're right. WOMAN: Fine. [DOOR CLOSES] - Ah. Hi. - Hi. I'm so sorry, I thought that we reserved this room for a private meeting. - We did. Sorry. - Oh, with me. Heh. I'm Trish Evans, your birth mom. Oh. Oh, oh, wow. Yeah. - It's so... It's so nice to meet you. - Yes. Yeah, indeed, doctor. - Screw Holly. - I'm out of the closet now, remember? You should've seen her, wielding George Lafferty's phone number around as if it was some weapon against my family. I know. You were terrified. Well, I was. Bringing William's illegitimate son into the mix was not something I wanted to do, and, ha-ha, too bad for Holly, it's not gonna happen. What are you making anyway? Cupcakes for Tommy and Julia's party tonight. I'm not saying telling George was easy. It wasn't. He was devastated at first, and then, in the end, he decided he didn't want Ryan to know anything about it. Even if William is Ryan's biological father, George raised him. - That's all that matters. - Right. Okay. So pick a card. Are you even listening to me? George Lafferty doesn't want anything to do with our family. The whole sordid business is over, done, poof. Right, exactly, poof. Now, come on, pick a card. - Remember what it is. Okay, you got it? - Yeah. Put it back. Don't tell me. Great. You're like a child. You're so excited we're going to Magic Manor tonight. The last time I went there, Tommy was years 10 years old, I taught him his first trick. Yes, I'm excited. He's celebrating his anniversary there tonight. Are you kidding? [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Oh. George. Oh, no. No, no. I was just thinking about you. Now? Really? Okay. Could you do it over here? Okay. Fine. See you in a while. What? He's having second thoughts. He's thinking maybe he should tell Ryan the truth. There goes poof. [SIGHS HEAVILY] TRISH: I take it from your reaction you didn't read my application. - No, but we did. - We did. - We read it, like, a hundred times. - A lot. A lot. I think that when you said your goal was to become a surgeon, we didn't know that you actually were a surgeon. We thought it was more of a long-term thing. And, you know, that you were still a student in Missouri. Well, I'm from Missouri, but I'm doing my residency here. It's a great surprise. What's your specialty? - Neuro. - Wow, a brain surgeon. - Not yet. I'm only in my second year. - Congratulations. - This is gonna be a smart baby. - Yeah. I can only speak for half of the chromosomes. Oh, so the father wasn't exactly a neurosurgeon himself? - Honey, the father was listed as unknown. - I know. We hooked up at a conference. Not my finest hour. - It happens. - And I know you guys said ethnicity doesn't matter. - No. - But he was white, and my mom's Korean, and my dad's black, so I guess you're in for a surprise. [ALL CHUCKLE] Yeah, so brain surgery. That must be a lot of hard work. Is that why you made an adoption plan? Medicine's my baby. I don't have the time or energy for another. Was that decision difficult? Not really. I weighed the pros and cons, and for me, adoption made sense. - Right, right. And how about your family? - Oh, completely supportive. You won't have any long-Iost relatives bugging you. - Oh, we're not at all worried about that. - Yeah, no. I didn't mean it like that. [PAGER VIBRATING] Oh, it's the ER. You guys are great. I feel really good about this. - I gotta run. - No, no, wait, wait. I feel like we just got started. Is that it? I have to travel to Houston for a seminar tomorrow. I could do dinner. We have the anniversary, but we could cancel. But this is much more important. No, that would be great. Okay, I'll call you guys when whatever train wreck downstairs is over. How's that? - Fantastic. - All right. - Thanks. ROBERT: Thank you. - She is fantastic. - Yeah. - She's perfect. - Yeah. No, she is. What, you don't think so? What? No. I'm... I just, you know, I... She did not admit to having any doubt. Don't you think that's a little weird? No, I don't think it's weird. I think it's decisive. Look, this... Honey, this is all good. Don't over think it. Really. Okay? - Yeah. - It's great. - All right, I gotta go. I'll see you later. - Okay. [DOOR OPENS] - George, can't I get you a cup of tea? - No, that's okay. I really don't want to take up too much of your time. Oh, that's okay. I'm the one who opened Pandora's box. What is it they say, ignorance is bliss? Yes, ignorance is bliss. Total and complete and utter bliss. George, maybe you were right the first time. Maybe you should put it in the box, lock it up, throw away the key. Let the past be the past. That's what I thought I wanted. Then Ryan called, and the whole conversation, I felt like I was lying to him. You wanted to protect him. That was your first instinct. George, I think you should go with that instinct. I don't know. Sometimes I think it's me I'm trying to protect. Ryan struggled growing up. It never felt like he fit in. Is this why? Would knowing help him make sense of things? And then I think again how hard he took his mother's death. And now to tell him his whole identity was based on a lie, a lie she told him. I don't think he can handle that. That's why I called you. That's why I can't sleep at night. [TIMER BEEPING] That's the cupcakes. And you really look like you could use one. At this point, I could eat the whole batch. [CHUCKLES] Well, let's just start with one. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Yeah. - Kevin Walker? - Yes. Spencer Travis from the Sacramento Tribune. Thanks for coming by. Take a seat. It's good to see that nepotism's alive and well. Okay, let's set the record straight. I didn't get this job... I'd rather set the record straight on something else, like that rumor floating around about the governor's affair. We got a tip, camped out at the Hotel Gerard. Did you try the restaurant? Four stars. - I hear it's fantastic. - I've got photographs. That's Governor Kern arriving at 11 a.m. Through the back door. That's 20 minutes later. Senator McCallister through the same door. - They both checked in under aliases. - Irrelevant. - They're both public figures. - That doesn't seem irrelevant to me. It seems like they don't want anyone to know. You know, there's an election going on. I'm sure you could get a bigger story than this. Heh. Well, this is a big story. It's not as big as the libel suit you'd be facing if you run with it. That's interesting. So far you've given me irrelevant, and now you've given me libel, but not once have you denied it. [CHUCKLES] - Look, I'm denying it. - I'm gonna give you 24 hours to tell me what happened at that meeting, and then I'm running the story. Fine. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] All right, so call ICU, make sure they've got a bed ready. Excuse me, Trish. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Dr. Evans. Hi. I'll meet you in postop. Kitty. What's going on? Well, I was just wondering if it would be possible for me to ask you a couple of questions before dinner. Well, I've got about three minutes, so shoot. Okay, okay. Well, this might sound silly, but I've always been under the assumption that our birth mother would be... Um... Well, you know, some kind of messed up kid. But you... See, you could do this. I mean, even if you work nonstop, you could hire a nanny. Ha-ha. I don't want a nanny. I just keeping thinking about what you said this morning, how your career is your baby, and I used to say the same thing, and then I changed my mind. So I just wanted to make sure that you've, you know, thought this through. Kitty, I'm a surgeon. I think everything through. For now, but what about when you finish your residency? You know what happens to egg quality. I really don't need a reproductive health lecture. Oh, no. I'm... No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. All I'm saying is that things change. I mean, what's going to happen when you see the heartbeat or you see the little toes or... - I've seen the toes. - Okay, well, what about when your friends all start having babies, and all they talk about are strollers and onesies and Baby Mozart? Okay, stop, stop. Look, they make us sit down for a reason: So we can see if this works for both of us. - Right. - Obviously, it doesn't. No, no, no. That is not what I'm saying at all. - I just wanna be sure that you're sure. - Kitty, I deal with enough neuroses with my patients. I'm sorry. Well, wait. What about dinner? I've been on call for 36 hours. Let's not waste each other's time. Can we talk? Talk to Stu. I don't weigh in by the hour. That reporter has photographs of you and the governor sneaking into Hotel Gerard. Kevin, I spent $40 million last year trying to get my face in front of the American people. I'd like to think that I can't sneak in anywhere. Are you having an affair? Kitty's my sister. I have a right to ask. You know, this morning it was the antigay marriage initiative, now it's your sister. This job isn't about your personal issues. It's about you supporting and protecting my professional agenda. - I can't do that if I don't have the facts. - The facts are I met with the governor to discuss a sensitive political issue. - Beyond that, it is confidential. - Oh, okay. And the meeting you ran off to this morning, is that confidential too? That meeting was with our birth mother, who, by the way, happens to be amazing. But if she picks up the paper tomorrow and reads a slanderous story about me and another government official, she could change her mind. So if you're really concerned with your sister, not to mention your job, you'll suck it up and you'll figure out a way to fix it. And you better figure out a way to trust me, or this isn't gonna work out. If you don't mind. [PLAYING GUITAR CHORDS] Did you guys read the focus-group report? The web applications aren't user-friendly enough. No way. A chimp could navigate that program. Well, we didn't test it on a chimp. Listen, people just want to enter a product, and find out the greenest way to get it. - What'd they think of our graph? - The colors are confusing. If the asparagus is flown in from Argentina, it's red, but if it's trucked in from Mexico, it's orange. It's because it's all about mileage. More mileage, more gas, more damage to the environment. I don't understand why that's difficult. Because people think it is. Page 26. Oh, nice, E. - Draw her a rocket ship. - Look, I don't need to see his rocket ship. - Heh. - Nice. [CHUCKLES] Whoa, hey. What's with this magic stuff? It's for my brother's anniversary party at Magic Manor. Listen, guys, could we please focus? I don't know. We may have lost him. You're looking at the magic club president. I don't care if he's David Blaine. And the music? I married a failed musician. I'd really prefer not to be working with one. - This is our process. - Well, it's not mine, okay? At my house, no magic tricks, no music, no fricking rocket ships or crazy robots. [PHONE RINGS] I have two kids, a mortgage. I don't have time for this. - Hello. - All right, I'm panicked. The parlor magician canceled on the day of the party. - What's a parlor magician? ETHAN: Oh, I know. It's the guy from Victorian times who walked around the parlor doing tricks. JULIA: So much for the magic of Tommy and Julia. What's a magic party without a magician? It's a disaster, that's what it is. - I think I might have a substitute for you. - You do? - Sarah, how is that even possible? SARAH: It's magic. He'll be there at 6. This is just so crazy. Ryan has five half siblings. He doesn't even know who they are. That's not how life's supposed to go. You and I, we're the parents, before you know it, we'll be dead and gone. - Oh, now that's cheerful. - You know what I mean. Your siblings are with you for the long haul. Well, I can't argue with you there. My brother Saul is my best friend, and my kids have always had each other. They fight, but they've always had each other. I actually wish I could meet them. It's like I need a crystal ball or something. I can't believe I'm gonna say this. Why don't you come to the party tonight? You could see for yourself. Maybe it would help you make a decision. It would. But then what if I decide not to pursue it? Your whole family would know. Well, no one knows you except Kitty, and she's not even gonna be there. So we just tell them I'm some handsome stranger you picked up? Yeah. Bob. Bob? No, I don't want to be Bob. How about Mick Jagger? Well, I don't think they'd believe that. How about Bob Jagger? And we met... Wait, where did we meet? A widow's mixer. First you wanna a rock 'n' roll star, and then you're trolling for widows? How about Dylan Jagger? You are so stuck in the '60s. [DOORBELL RINGS] REBECCA: Come in. [DOORBELL RINGS] - Just use your key. - I thought you wanted me to ring the bell. Seriously? I didn't mean never use your key. That's kind of a mixed signal, don't you think? This is about this morning, isn't it? - Listen, I wasn't expecting... - Please don't explain. - I didn't want to say it because you said it. - Rebecca... You got to find your moment. I wanna find mine. Can we just drop this? Let's just go to the party, all right? Everything's fine. Great. Exactly what I'm in the mood for, an anniversary party. Awesome. [DOOR OPENS] Oh, hey. I thought we were meeting at the restaurant. [SIGHS] No. - Trish canceled dinner. - Oh. - Did something come up at the hospital? - No, actually, it's much worse than that. She... She changed her mind about the adoption. - What are you talking about? - Look, I know how much you loved her, but I had a very weird feeling, so I went to the hospital, - I stopped by to see her. - You stopped by? I wanted to talk to her. And the minute I brought up some issues, she pulled out on the spot. But things were perfect. They were more than perfect. - That's what you thought. - No, that's what Trish said. And now the whole adoption is off? What on earth did you say to her? I just told her that I was a career woman myself, and that I didn't want to have a baby, and now I did. I just wanted to make sure that she considered what it would feel like to give up a baby at her age. - You mentioned her age? - This is not my fault. She was gonna change her mind no matter what, or she never would've reacted that way. I don't get it. Do you even want this? - Of course I want this. - Then how, after everything we've been through, when we finally get chosen by a woman who is smart and talented and more than we ever could've hoped for in a birth mother, do you choose to go and confront her on her decision? Because we were about to get our hearts broken. Well, if you're not ready to have your heart broken, you're not ready to be a parent. - You don't have to walk away. - Yeah, I do. WOMAN 1: Now he did it. WOMAN 2: I know. - Tommy. - Hey, guys. Happy anniversary. Yeah. Julia went all out. Guess she still loves me, huh? Must be nice. I'm gonna go get a drink. - What's...? - Don't ask. NORA: Hi, boys. - Hey, Mom. - Happy anniversary. - Thank you. - Sweetheart, hi. - Hi, Mom. Boys, I would like you to meet my friend Elton. - Elton? - It's a family name. - Lot of people named Elton. - No, I didn't mean it like... Sorry. - I'm Tommy. - Hi. Congratulations. - I hear it's your anniversary. - Thank you. Tommy runs the family business. He's the one that put the winery in, and he has the most beautiful little daughter, Elizabeth, my granddaughter. And this is my son Justin. WOMAN: I know, I shouldn't have said that. Well, that about sums it up. Pick a card. - That's the one you want? - Yes. - You sure? Positive. - Positive. ETHAN: Okay. Was that your card? JULIA: No way. - How'd you do that? That's great. - Thank you. - He's great, Julia. I know. Sarah found him. I have no idea how. You know, I have my sources. Okay, Miss Clara the fortuneteller knew everything about me. Knew my first pet's name started with a W. This miniature Bijon my parents used to have. She knew I had trouble making decisions, which is not gonna affect us and our business. Um... Mm? - Hi, I'm Kyle. - I'm Julia. KYLE: Julia, nice to meet you. - Hi. Holly. Nice to meet you. Sarah's business partner. - Yeah, I'm consulting for... KYLE: Consulting? You're, like, one of the founders. So is he. We're starting an internet company. Oh, I didn't realize that you were in business with a magician. - Give it a break, Holly. - Sarah, so who's your mom's new guy? - Mom has a guy? JULIA: You don't know? She brought a guy. Hmm. Excuse me. Thank you. So how do you two know each other? - Ah-ha-ha. It's funny. - No, it is. - It's really a funny story. - It's very funny. SARAH: Hey, guys. - Hey. - Isn't this great? I feel like a kid again. - This is my beautiful daughter Sarah. - Elton. GEORGE: Hi. - Elton. - Mom was gonna tell us how they met. Oh, God. I love the "how we met" stories. Go on. We were at a restaurant a... Not together. We weren't together, were we? And this man began to choke. [BOTH LAUGH NERVOUSLY] And Elton, he just went over there and gave him the Heimlich maneuver, - just like that. - Nora called the paramedics. And then we started talking, and we have just so much in common. - Hilarious. SARAH: Wow, Mom. Some guy almost dies, and you go score a date. - Good girl. - It's not a date, per se. - Yeah, and don't worry. He was fine. - Yeah. - Once he spit out the fish bone. - Ham gristle. - Ham gristle? - Was it fish bones? - It was a fish bone. - Yeah. Oh, it was a fish bone. I didn't even know what it was. Okay, so why don't you kids go have some fun? We're going to go and enjoy the magic and all that. - Nice meeting you. - You too, Elton. - What was that? - Guess mom has a new boyfriend. Elton? Really? Ah. I see it. Look toward the bottom of the cup. See how the leaves form the shape of a heart? Sort of, if I squint. - What does that mean? - It means there's a great love in store. - Someone is out there waiting for you. - Yeah, that would be my boyfriend. He's out there waiting for me to say "I love you." Actually, the placement indicates the distant future. - It could take years to meet this person. - Years? What about now? What are you saying, that Justin's love isn't great? - I can only interpret what's here. - You don't even know him. I mean, you're just reading some leftover dregs from a stupid teacup. It's not stupid, unless your spirit is closed. My spirit is not closed. I mean, who said that my spirit is closed? Your spirit is closed. Look, I know you think you're in love, but I promise, another few years, a great love will come along. You're not even going to remember this guy. This is wonderful, Ethan. Great. Oh, Kevin, you're here. You just missed some fantastic magic. Not a fan, remember? I actually need your advice, okay? You worked for your brother-in-law. What did you do when Dad did things you didn't like? I don't know what you're talking about. Okay, you didn't tell Mom about Holly for one thing. I didn't tell your mother because I thought I was protecting her. My job is to protect Robert, and I'm not saying he's Dad, but he's asking me to cover for him without telling me what it is I'm covering. All he says is I have to trust him. Do you? I don't know. We all know you're the family cynic. I mean, certainly, that's why you hate magic. You just are always looking for the angle. You can't give in to the illusion. But Robert is not an illusion. That's what you're gonna have to decide for yourself, if he's putting one over on you or if Robert is the real thing. And by the way, Kevin, if you can't trust him, don't work for him. - Make it, you know? - Excuse me, sorry. - Hey. - Can I talk to you? Where you been? I've been looking all over for you. I love you. - You do? - Mm-hm. Yeah. God, that felt good. Heh. Wow. - Damn right, that feels good. - Ha-ha. I know. I feel like there's weight off my shoulders. That woman had no idea what she was talking about. GUEST: Yeah. - What woman? Nothing. Just this fortuneteller. She said that you're not my great love. Whatever. Wait, that's why you said it, because some fortuneteller told you we were doomed? So this is your moment? Rebecca, this seems like a lame protest to me. - Why are you making such a big deal? - Well, I'm sorry, where I come from, saying "I love you" comes from the people saying it. Okay, well, sorry. I can't seem to say anything right. Why don't you just write me a script? You know what? I'm gonna give you these back. And when you figure it out, you let me know, all right? - So Elton? - Yes, Elton. Why are you guys so hung up on his name? Have you guys done the dance with no pants? - Sarah. - What? Come on. One of us should be having sex, and sadly, it's not me. Well, it's not me either. Just because I brought a friend to the party does not mean we're sleeping together. You brought two men. I'm not accusing you of having a ménage à trois. - Mom. - Well, you're the one who brought up sex. Well, I regret it. Almost as much as I regret bringing Ethan and Kyle. Holly practically did a cartwheel when she heard we were in business together. Holly doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. I don't know, Mom. Maybe she's right. I mean, a start-up in this financial climate? Bear Stearns can't even keep afloat, and I'm in business with a magician who wants to show me his rocket ship. - Oh, no. SARAH: You think I made a mistake. - Oh, my God. - Oh, God. It's bad. I really screwed up. - Oh, hey. - Kitty, what are you doing here? I thought you were meeting with your birth mother. - Yeah. - Well, I... It's a long story. - Well, good. Tell Sarah about it. - Whoa. - Ugh. What the is up with mom? - I don't know. She's been acting weird all night. She brought this guy. - Elton. - Elton? Exactly. What's with the briefcase? Robert won't give you the night off? - Kevin has a new job. - Yeah, he's a lawyer-turned-Republican. - I'm still a Democrat, dumb-ass. - Why don't you be nice? - You'll embarrass your mother's date. - It's not really a date. Elton, there you are. You know, it's such a lovely evening out. - Why don't we take a walk? - That sounds like a date to me. I was really enjoying talking to your family. - Oh. Hi. - Kitty. SARAH: This is funny. George? - What are you doing here? - This is Elton. That's Mom's date. Don't be rude. Do you want a drink? - Ah. You're dating Ryan's dad? - No, she's dating Elton Richards. - I'm not dating him. - What? I'm sorry. Excuse me. No, no. This is George Lafferty. JUSTIN: What? - Ryan's George Lafferty? KEVIN: Mom. - Mom, I knew you were hiding something. KEVIN: Mom. All right, fine. George, this is my family. Family, this is George Lafferty. Hi. Oh, my God. TOMMY: Unbelievable. JUSTIN: I thought you... Since when are you friends with George Lafferty? - He kicked us out of his house. - You were to his house? - Look, this is really all my fault. - No, it is not. I invited you here to meet Ryan's half siblings. I'm sorry we deceived you, but George needs to figure this out. I thought meeting you might help. What is this, a big audition to see if we're up to sibling snuff, Mom? - What's going on? Is everything okay? - Oh, hey, Julia. - Yes, fine. It's a lovely party. - I heard yelling. Our family? No. - We're just all catching up with George. - You mean Elton. How about some cupcakes? - Can you believe our mom? - Nothing our mom does shocks me anymore. [SIGHS] - Why are you so out of breath? - I've been looking for you. - Well, where's Scotty? - He couldn't get time off work. - Where's Robert? - Robert's at home being furious. Really? How furious? I went to see our birth mother. Oh, of course. Oh, good. - Good, good, good. - Oh, no. No, Kevin. Not good. Bad. Very bad. She changed her mind about the adoption. She's not gonna go through with it, not with us anyway. What, did she hear something about Robert? No. No, she loved Robert. It was me. I showed up with all of these questions because I wanted proof - that she wasn't gonna change her mind. - What's wrong with wanting proof? Well, what's wrong with it is that she couldn't give it to me, obviously. And she shouldn't have to. Mm. But it has nothing to do with Robert? Would you stop trying to make this about Robert? - This is about me. - All right. Kevin, I'm serious. I think I made a very big mistake. I... I couldn't trust her and... And now we don't have a baby. So fix it. MAN: Here you go, sir. CLARA: Looks like someone is on the horizon. Someone who will bring great upheaval into your life. No, no, no. I thought so too, but that's wrong. - No, this reading's clear. - The reading is wrong. George is actually a very nice guy just caught in a really difficult situation. I can identify with that. Well, the way these cards are spread, this person represents a threat. Maybe it's talking about his son Ryan. And I'm telling you right now, I am done being scared. Siblings should meet each other. I think we're finally gonna get the chance to meet him. And I'm actually happy about that. - That's good. - Yeah. That's great. What else do they say? Ladies and gentlemen, I know many of you don't believe in magic. Instead, you search for an explanation. There must be something I'm not telling you, something I'm hiding. You're right. Most of the time, magic is about sleight of hand, the principle of misdirection. I make you look one way, so you forget to look the other. [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] Hi. Have you seen a young woman, light brown hair, tall? I seem to have lost my daughter. - No, but I'll keep an eye out. - Okay. - What her name? - Rebecca. Thanks. Uh... Wait. Are you... Are you Holly? - Yeah. - I'm George Lafferty. Oh, my God. You're Ryan's dad. [CHUCKLES] - I guess you've heard about me too. - Yeah. I hope you don't mind, but Nora told me about what happened with your daughter. No, I don't mind. It's just that she might not be the most reliable narrator. Well, it's probably pretty complicated between you two. No, actually, it's quite simple. But I do know what it's like to be in your position, so if there's ever anything that I can do... - Holly? - Hmm? Uh... I do have a few questions. Sure. Watch closely because with Julia's help, you're about to see something so amazing, so improbable, it's hard to chalk it up to any fact or principle. Man has always dreamed of conquering gravity. In the 1800s, European audiences saw, for the first time, people rise unassisted off... So you called me down here. What do you got? There's an exit out that way. ETHAN: Just maybe it's magic. With one snap of my fingers, the lovely Julia will fall into a deep, deep sleep. [SNAPS] [CROWD CHUCKLING] [SNAPS] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] - Nora. - Oh! Oh, George. Sorry. - I got sucked into watching the show. - It's okay. I have to go. Go? What do you mean? You know, your family's lovely and teeny-weeny casting faux pas. Oh boy. - So you wouldn't mind if I...? - Darling the play is yours. Do with it what you wish. You probably shouldn't drink that. Well nobody's perfect. Well looks normal to me sweetheart. What exactly is it that's bothering you? Is it a sore throat? Tummy ache? Let's see. I've been having hot flashes insomnia and "osteorosis." That does sound serious. I thought so too. And it might even be contagious. I probably shouldn't be around people for a while. Well menopause isn't normally contagious honey. But then again it's also rare for it to occur in 9-year-old girls. There's a first time for everything. Well I guess we'll have to get you to a hospital. Take some blood tests run a few CAT scans. Blood tests? Like with needles? - Oh yeah. Big ones. - Dad maybe I don't have menopause. Oh really? Something else then? Maybe I just don't wanna do the play anymore. Why sweetheart? Because what if I stink? Then all those people will boo at me. If they boo at anybody it'll be the guy who can't remember his lines. Trust me you're not gonna stink. Well maybe I won't stink as bad as you but even still I could forget everything even how to sing. Do you remember when Uncle Brian was here and I had to do brain surgery again and I hadn't done it in a long time? - I was scared. - You were? I was terrified. I thought I was gonna forget how to do everything. I woke up that morning and I thought "There's no way. I can't do this." - You seemed okay to me. - Well that's what I wanted you to think. But I was faking. I pretended that I was okay when deep down I was really afraid. Next thing I knew I was in the hospital room doing brain surgery. And you know what? I got so good at pretending to be fine that I actually was. It's called "fake it till you make it." - Like my song says. - What song? - In the play. - Oh yeah. Fake it till you make it. I can do that. I know you can. - Your mom would be so proud of you. - Really? Really. - Good night sweetheart. - Good night Dad. You really think I'm gonna stink? - Can I talk to you for a second? - I thought we already finished this. Not exactly. I lied to you Ephram. I acted like the reason I was gonna be your friend was because of your dad but it's not. It's something else. All right. Let's hear it. I don't know you. But more importantly is you don't know me. You're the only person in this school who doesn't expect me to remember them or expect me to be this guy that I don't even know who he was. And I'm trying to please all these people but it's wearing me out man. I can understand that. But it's different with you because you don't have any expectations. And I don't have to feel guilty for not knowing you. See in a way I mean you know we're both new. And you look about as out of place as I feel which is probably why I approached you. But what I don't get is why you don't like me. Who said I didn't like you? Well it's obvious you don't like hanging around me. Is there a reason? No. No reason. We're cool. Cool. So let's talk about this "E" thing. Who came up with that? Probably Bright. Right. Hello everyone. Okay then. - You look nice today Baxworth. - I do? Yeah. Radiant. - Thank you Edna. - And Alice... Sir yes sir. You make a fine Tuptim. I like what you've done with the part. I should have told you that before. I'm sorry if I haven't been very... Nice? Encouraging. Private! I don't think I have to tell you what great work you're doing. You really had me convinced you're a boy on that stage and it freaks me out. - Thanks Edna. - And Dr. Brown? - Yes? - You're fired. - I'm what? - Executive decision. Had to be made. I'd appreciate it if you'd turn in your walking papers and exit without too much of a fuss. But I was making so much progress. How many children does Your Majesty have? Thirty-seven? - Junior! - Six! How do you feel about playing the King of Siam? - Who's offering? - I am. Gee Mother I don't know. Spielberg's heard of my work as the understudy. - We're in talks. - Come on Junior! The play needs you. Well I suppose the show must go on. Wouldn't want to let down Everwood's theater-going community. All right people. Swallow that last bite of crumb cake. We've got a dress rehearsal to get on. Delia was never in Romeo and Juliet. She was not the girl in Sleepless in Seattle. - She wasn't even born when it came out. - lf you're gonna dream dream big. Dr. Brown? - Hey Colin. How you feeling? - Pretty good. Look I know my parents probably sent you enough gift baskets to last a lifetime but I guess I just wanted to come by and thank you myself. You just keep doing what you're doing. That's all the thanks I need. Ephram do you wanna come sit with us? We saved a few extra seats. No. No thanks. I'm just gonna chill here with my dad. - Okay. - Catch you later. - You two friends now? - Kind of. - Turns out we have some stuff in common. - You mean Amy? - Surprisingly it has nothing to do with Amy. - So why don't you sit with him? Because of Amy. So who's this Evelyn Rauser? - Why do you ask? - Well I don't know. - The play's dedicated to her. Is she famous? - She's something of a legend around here. - She the reason you got fired? - I did not get fired. I chose to step down from the role. Artistic differences. Dad? It's nice to know you're not awesome at everything. All right troops fall in! She means form a line morons. I'll make this brief as we've got civilians out there waiting to be entertained. You've all worked hard. You've worked long. You've struggled against formidable odds to get where you are tonight. I'd be proud to lead you into battle anytime anyplace. That's all. Go get them soldiers. And good luck. I thought it was bad luck to say "good luck." It is but let's not tell her that. Places everybody! Evelyn Rauser had an expression for the few seconds before the curtain went up. She called it "the holy time." But you don't have to be an actor to know what the holy time feels like. It's that breath you take just seconds before you become the person you're meant to become. For some people, it feels like forever. And for some, it's a moment over far too fast. [ENGLISH] I wonder if the Philosopher's Stone would be in a desolate town like this. It almost seems like a lie that up until just recently, this town was prosperous from gold. Which is why they would be that much more likely to research the Philosopher's Stone. What do you mean? Since they stopped being able to get gold out of the mines, they'd want to transmute it with the Philosopher's Stone that much more. This used to be a gold producing area, and all, so if they created just a little, no one would find them out, right? It's terrible the way grown-ups think. Elisa! Hey, everyone, give me a hand here! It's no use! It won't budge! Papa... It's all right. We're going to help you out of there no matter what! What's the matter? My daughter is pinned! Just be patient for a bit, okay? Man cannot obtain anything without first sacrificing something. In order to obtain anything, something of equal value is required. That is alchemy's Law of Equivalent Exchange. At the time, we believed that to be the true way of the world. Wow, to think that an alchemist would come along! You really came through for us! Thanks to his armored father, too! No, no, we're brothers, actually. This is my younger brother. Younger brother? Even though he's bigger than you, Big Brother? Anyhow, we're glad that you weren't hurt, Elisa. Elisa! Is Elisa all right! ? Uncle Belsio! Papa...? Look, you... How dare you come into my house! After making Elisa help you out like that! Listen to me, Elisa. No matter what anyone tells you, you can't help Belsio out in his work any more! No! It wasn't Uncle Belsio's fault! I asked him to let me help out! I-I'm sorry, Elisa! Here, drink this. I'm sorry. Uncle Belsio told me that your lemon pies were the best, Papa. And that it was a shame that there were so few farms left in town. Hey now, once the Philosopher's Stone is finished, the town will become prosperous! Then, we'll be able to buy our fruit! Philosopher's Stone! ? Right, right! You two came to assist Mugwar in his research, right? To create a Philosopher's Stone? Alchemist, please create the Philosopher's Stone as soon as you can! We want to get back our town of gold, Xenotime, no matter what! We're depending on you, Master Alchemist! It looks like there's a lot to this. B-but in any case, I guess we'll go see this Mugwar person. By the way, if you would please tell us your names...? Our names? I'm Edward. Edward Elric. H-his brother, Alphonse. Alphonse Elric. The Elric Brothers? The State Alchemist ones? Yeah! What did you do that for! ? You hush! The real Elric Brothers are already up there! Come back when you've decided to be honest about your real names! Who is it that's been using my name, here? Brother, are you really planning to sneak in? Course I am! I'm going to catch that impostor, and have him tell me about the Philosopher's Stone while I'm at it. Brother? Was that...? A transmutative reaction. Look at this. This is all material on the Philosopher's Stone. So, this is where they're making the Philosopher's Stone, all right. No doubt about it. This place is off limits to unauthorized persons. By any chance, are you guys...? There you are, you imposters! Which would mean that you're the real Edward, huh? No! No! I'm Edward! Me! You're the older brother? Got any problem with that! ? Don't get so excited. The security guys will realize you're here. What do you know, the younger brother wears armor, huh? You sure don't look like you're fourteen. You know about us? What, you want to go at it? If you guys will go home quietly, I don't plan on fighting. Just let us stay here for a little while longer. Is that any attitude to be asking somebody for something with? Sit. Stop looking down on me! That would bother you, huh? Being only that tall, when you're fifteen? Automail, huh? The real one has his troubles too, it seems. By saying that, you sound as if you haven't just been living in idleness yourself! I'd like to have a look at the skill of a State Alchemist. You're gonna be sorry you did! Not bad. No transmutation circle, huh? Huh, the imposter doesn't use a transmutation circle either! ? Why, you! Have you got a Philosopher's Stone! ? What was that noise just now! ? This way! Damn! I ache all over. That imposter sure was strong, huh? It was just the Stone's power, after all. So, I wonder if they've completed a Philosopher's Stone yet. We're going to make sure we find out. I wonder what those brothers' names are. The two of them must have real names, after all. I wonder if the older brother is older than you, Brother. Don't go judging us just on our size! Brother, let's give this up, already. If those two tell what's really going on, what will we do? Don't worry. Nobody is going to believe what they say. Let's hurry and complete the Philosopher's Stone, and leave town. I hope it goes that smoothly. I won't let Mugwar get the credit for the research that Dad spent his whole life on. But... Don't worry. If it comes to that, I'll make sure that no matter what, at least you get away. Brother, you don't understand. That won't... make me happy... Are you sure you should be just standing there like that? You're here, are you? It seems some outsiders have appeared. Y-yes, but not to worry. The Elric Brothers have been chased away. I'm not so sure. Those boys could prove to be extraordinarily crafty. But then, having come to this point it's only a matter of time before the military comes to learn of the research. I think that maybe it's about time you pulled out, Mugwar. Please don't say that! Give me just a little more time, please! I promise you, I will complete the Philosopher's Stone! Hurry. Use any means that you have to. It's starting to swell up pretty good. It feels so good that you're so cold. I'm happy to be of use to you, Brother, even in this body. You were at the store this evening. If you have no place to stay, then come to my place. Thanks for helping us out. I couldn't let you children sleep outside. You're not going to ask us our names? You're the Elric Brothers, right? Then, you believe us? No. I just think that everyone has their own reasons. And I'm not the one who bears the responsibility for them. That's up to you. You don't appear to have any interest in the Philosopher's Stone, huh? The folks in this town are still unable to forget the wealth that gold has brought them. And Mugwar has them wrapped around his finger. Good morning, Uncle Belsio! If you keep coming to my place, you're going to get yelled at again by your pop. No problem, no problem! Papa is all wrapped up in talk about the gold mine. He won't notice. Good morning. Big Brothers, you're here...! Wow, that looks like it hurts! That's what you get for telling lies, huh? I'm telling you, we're not the ones who are lying. And yet I'm the one who gets clocked! You don't mean, you're the ones who snuck into Mugwar's mansion yesterday, Big Brothers? Of course it was us! We can't let those imposters get away with this, you know! And besides, using a Philosopher's Stone to make gold is no small matter. Brother... I'm going to go see what's happening in town. Brother! - Yes? - Hey, big guy! Would you go to the drugstore for me? I'd like for you to get Elisa's medicine, and your brother needs a compress too, right? Say, it's that armor. He's that impostor! Oh, dear! I wish he would hurry up and leave. I'll bet it was those boys that broke in to rob Mugwar's mansion last night. Hey, you! What have you come here for! ? I-I need to get some medicine... We don't have any medicine that treats liars! Go on! Go on! I give up. I can't buy any medicine like this. Um... You... I'll go buy your medicine for you. An equivalent exchange... to apologize for us lying. Here. Thank you very much. Both of us have it hard when our older brothers act rash, huh? Aren't you angry? You must have your reasons, right? I'm sorry. For us to participate in Mugwar's research, we needed to use names such as yours. To be a child, and still be a State Alchemist - the Elric Brothers are the only ones around. You need the Philosopher's Stone that badly? It's something that my dad spent his whole life researching. Then, your father was an alchemist, too? Mm-hmm. But then, one day, he was suddenly gone. That's why my brother is forcing himself to carry on after my dad. That's the complete opposite of our family. My brother hates our dad, who was also an alchemist. Our dad was completely absorbed in alchemy, and so our mom suffered because of it. We've also seen a bunch of other people who have met with sadness because of alchemy. Listen, if your brother is doing something wrong, then you're the only one who can stop him. You can't make others do it. If you do, I think your brother will be deeply hurt. I've been a little concerned about this, but aren't there a lot of people coughing around town? U-uh-huh. Is this cough medicine, then? I-it's... Brother...! Sorry, I have to go now. Hey, what's your name? Fletcher! Brother! ? What's the matter? The impostor is here! The older one! Have you seen him? Uh-uh. That bastard! What a hypocrite! He's been fixing the townspeople's hoes, and transmuting wheels for them! That's better than having him do bad things, though. I don't like the way he operates! He's ignoring the Law of Equivalent Exchange! Al, we're going to sneak in there again tonight! Even though it's the very next day! ? Because it's the very next day! Brother... There's something I want to talk about. Today, we're going with the mole-man campaign! Mole-man...? All right, we should just about be under the building now. Are you sure? Well, we're going to come out somewhere. We're there! What is this? Could it be... that this is the water that forms the base of the red stone. Red stone? I read some documents about it at the library in Central. It's a stone, made of a compound of roughly the same material as the Philosopher's Stone, which you get by refining red water. Then, you can make a Philosopher's Stone from this water? Apparently, it won't be the exact same thing, but yeah. As I remember, some alchemist named Nash-or-similar was researching it. But in the end, it didn't work out. Brother? For some reason, I suddenly feel... Brother! Brother! Over here! Who's there! ? It's me! Quickly! Hurry up! Fletcher... Brother, are you all right? Huh? What is this place? What are you doing here! ? I-I'm sorry... W-what? What are you crying about? Fletcher... If you know something, tell us. You really don't like what's going on here, do you? That red water... It's water that's very dangerous to humans. But it's vital for creating a red stone. You mean, the people in town are also coughing because of that? I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Geez, this is ridiculous. I'll just smash all of this up. I can't let you do that. We've finally raised up a red stone this far. My dad sacrificed himself for this. If his experiments go unfulfilled, he'll never be redeemed, right? What's so great about that half-baked rock? That sword is just a fake too, right? I'm going to mess you up, together with your rock! Mine is the genuine article! What! ? It's the red water. If you're showered with it, you're done for. You won't just lose consciousness! Fine! Brother! This is crazy! You're brother is right! Get out of here! No way! I'm not going to lose to someone who's chasing after his own pop! Fletcher! Fletcher, hang in there! Brother, Dad was researching the red water to bring happiness to people, right? And yet, what we're doing is making the people in town suffer, aren't we? Brother, you should have known this! It doesn't matter who gets credit, does it? Dad... Dad would not be happy about this! Fullmetal Alchemist! Episode 12: "Earth of Gravel, Part 2" Now that you've taken on the name of Edward Elric, are you prepared for the consequences! ? - Who is to fire the fatal shot? - I do not know his name. Only that he is a Jesuit sent from France for the purpose. Where is he now? Perhaps fled, or hidden by his fellow conspirators, but the king's life is yet in grave danger. What danger? He will be poisoned. So now it is poison? And who will do the deed, or do you not know that either? I know his name well. It is Sir George Wakeman. The queen's personal physician? ! He is the most honest and upright of men! He's a Papist, is he not? The queen's household is riddled with treason. If you're lying, I promise you, your torture will be cruel! Who wrote these? They were brought to me at the Royal Society by an honest Christian preacher named Israel Tonge... Never mind the Royal Society! Who wrote them? One who knows the conspirators intimately. His name is Titus Oates. The final rites of their black mass spoken, Jesuit priests, crazed with bloodlust, swept into the village to seize two young virgins - children of no more than eight years. Angels! - Torn from their mothers' arms! - Stop, Titus! I cannot listen! No, go on. What did these foul monsters do to their victims? The screams of burning innocents are a horrible thing, Israel! God save us! The Catholic religion is guilty of horrors beyond imagining! Kirkby must have acted by now. If not, England is lost. Where is Titus Oates? At your service, sir! Scholar, philosopher and loyal guardian of the flame of truth! My Lord Danby wishes to speak to you. As news of the king's death became known, 6,000 Catholics were to rise as one and slaughter us all in our beds. Picture it, my lord! London's streets running crimson with honest Protestant blood! How did you come by this information? I overheard it in the queen's household. Do you now claim intimacy with the queen herself? No, sir, but your lordship well knows that the palace is open to anyone that has business at court What does the French King know of this? That demom and the Pope are the authors of the plot! - I thought you said it was the queen and the Duke of York? - Papists all, shoulder to shoulder in villainy! There's not a moment to waste. The French army are massing at Calais. An invasion might be launched at any moment. I think my spies would have informed me if there was a French army at Calais. Perhaps the Pope invoked some dark magic to render them invisible. I need more than gossip and mischief! I will see all three of you in the stocks in the morning. - God have mercy, It is the truth! - If you condemn us Sir, the king will die and you will be held accountable. Your Majesty! Your loyalty and concern for my safety do you credit, Mr Oates. Where is your proof? Safely hidden from prying eyes, Your Majesty. A wise precaution. and tell me who are the English Catholics behind this terrible conspiracy? Give me names. Beyond the queen and the Duke of York, there are the Lords Stafford, Arundell, Wardour, Powis, Petre, Belasyse, Wakeman, the queen's physician, and Edward Coleman, secretary to the Duchess of York, among many others. This is nothing more than a list of every eminent Catholic in the land! I have letters proving their guilt. Follow me, Mr Oates. Bring your friends with you. You never said anything about letters! If I had, the Jesuits would have cut your throat to find them. Stand firm. We shall beat the devil yet. What was your business at Whitehall, Mr Oates? Who invited you here? I attended on your ministers many times to warn of the Catholic peril. Alas they never had time to see me. My sympathy. Sometimes they're so busy they hardly have time for the king himself. But still, after so many hours here, you must have come to know my palace well. Intimately, sir. Then you will have no difficulty in leading us to the place in the Queens house where you heard this treason being plotted. This is where I heard them planning your death, Your Majesty. Most convenient for any traitor with a weak stomach! Your Majesty, I remember it clearly. It was a long room... with tall double doors... You do not know your way because you've never been here in your life before! Nothing this scoundrel says can be believed! I'm off to Newmarket in the morning. Do not bother me with this again. At your service, my lord. (DANBY) Let me hear your explanation again Sir. I have known Lord Powis these many years. - This is not his hand. - The writing is disguised. - The Jesuits teach such skills to their disciples. - They teach well. Not one of these seditious letters resembles its author's customary hand. You say you know these conspirators intimately. - Who wrote this? - Lord Stafford. Of all these villains, he is the worst. Stafford is a distinguished Fellow of the Royal Society and nigh on 70 years old. He has a vicious spirit of a villain half his age and is closely allied to the Duke of York. Examine the Duke's household, and you will find all the evidence you need of treason. Strike now, my lords! Hesitate and all might be lost! Stop! There is no conspiracy, is there? Hm? The truth now, or I'll beat the life from you. Every word is gospel. Bring me a Bible and I will swear... I know baseless malice when I see it. What is your purpose in all this? - Is it money and preferment you seek? - You insult me, sir. Christ himself, he came to me in a dream! He charged me with the protection of the Protestant faith in England. I was a minister... in a Catholic school... and the boys laid false and filthy charges against me, and I lost my position. I'm determined to have my revenge on their whole stinking blasphemous faith! You have chosen the moment for your game well. In such a desperate time, even your ridiculous lies might be believed. What will you do with me, sir? I have reasons of my own to let your poison circulate unhindered. If others cannot tell a fake when they see one, that is their misfortune. What of the king? He doesn't believe me. The king has more pressing concerns, schoolmaster. 5,000 pounds on a single turn of the cards? ! If you shout at me, I shall faint. Now you expect me to honour your debts. Well, I cannot afford it! You have stolen my honour! Now you mean to make me a beggar! If you need money, why don't you ask your patron Louis? - The King of France gives me nothing. - Of course he does! - He values his little spy in my bedroom too much to neglect her. - I am not a spy! Do you think I don't know about your clandestine audiences with the French ambassador? What do you talk about, I wonder,the English weather? I cannot live with such wicked treatment! You know how delicate I am. If I fall ill and die, it will be your fault! You are not going to die over a few cross words. Of course I'll pay your creditors. But you must be more careful in future. 5,000 is not very much. Is it? We won't talk about it any more. There, now. It's all better, isn't it? The king still loves his little Fubs. These letters were for Louis. You say you will work to destroy the Protestant heresy and restore the Catholic faith to England, that you pray for the day the Duke of York takes the king's place! As God is my witness, I meant no harm to anyone. These are dreams, not plots. Opinions of no significance. You shared your ambitions with the Duke of York. He encouraged you in this! The Duke of York is innocent of any crime. I swear I am no traitor. (CHARLES) I asked you to end this matter. Now it is infinitely worse. What London believes is more important than the evidence. The mob will soon grow bored of Oates' ridiculous accusations. - Put the perjuring villain in prison. - He's under the protection of Parliament. Oates will give Parliament all the excuse it needs to strike at Catholics. God help any poor creature that gets caught in his net. Oates said Coleman's letters would contain treason, and they did. A lucky chance, nothing more. Picture your own wives and mothers, sons and daughters, tied to stakes in the midst of flames, screaming out to God with hands and eyes uplifted to heaven! On the outside the Catholic looks like us, eats, drinks and sleeps like us, but inside he is not as we are. He hates our liberty and works every moment to destroy it He would make slaves of us in our own country Only Parliament can protect England from the yoke of tyranny! A warrant from Parliament for the arrest of Lord Stafford. - On what charge? - Treason. - Father! - This is some error or false accusation... You are mistaken! Please! Please help me! No! No! No! Please! Please! Please! No! No! God in heaven have mercy on me! I am innocent... The queen is a Catholic and yet is well known for her loyalty and devotion. This plot cannot be any of her doing. She is mistress in her own household. Nothing takes place there without her consent. I heard from her own lips that she would no longer tolerate the king's lechery and violation of the marriage bed. She told the Jesuits that she would have her revenge, and promised them 5,000 pounds for the deed! I accuse the queen of conspiring to cause the king's death! The man's a fraud. I know you'd never do anything to harm me. You know it, but does England? Oates has the whole country terrified. You understand there is no truth in what he says? - Do I look like a fool? - Clever men hang on his every word. Common sense counts for little where religion is concerned. - Are you not frightened of the Papists, then? - I'm more frightened of the mob. - Mobs have their uses in the right cause. - Parliament's cause. For 20 years, we have fought to see who rules in England. Now the time has come to settle the matter once and for all. This useless body of mine is like some rotting piece of meat. It decays inch by inch, moment by moment. I have little time left, but I am determined that before I die, this country will be freed for ever from the unbridled power of kings. Parliament will rule in England. Attack the king himself, and I can go no further with you. Let the old goat frolic with his whores in the time he has left to him, but his heir will be Parliament's choice. The king loves you above all others. The bravest and most brilliant of his court. (MONMOUTH) Such virtues come naturally. I must take no credit for them. The king would show you greater favour if he could. He would name you as his heir. The Duke of York's claim cannot be allowed to stand. A Protestant king for a Protestant country. The king will never acknowledge me as his true-born son. The king must appear to support his brother. In private, he yearns for your success. When the tide in your favour becomes irresistible, he will bow to an act of Parliament declaring you legitimate. He told you this? Be bold, and you shall have your reward. God save the king! I have never run away from a fight and I will not start now. It's to avoid a fight that you must leave for a time. With the introduction of the House of Commons bill, your succession hangs in the balance. Your presence here is a constant reminder of their grievance. Will I be allowed to return, or will you betray me in favour of your preening bastard Monmouth? You're my brother... and my heir... and what is mine is mine. I will not allow Parliament to dictate the succession. Now for pity's sake, will you help me? Your Majesty, there is a further matter of the gravest importance. I have in my possession... letters from the king's chief minister begging for aid from our oldest and most implacable enemy! Filthy French money... for the king to rule alone in defiance of Parliament? ! What shall we call this but treason pure and simple? Danby must be impeached before this house for his dealings! It's that French bitch Carwell! Drag her out and put the Papist whore in the stocks where she belongs! Good people! You are mistaken! I am the Protestant whore! I am called a prostitute, and summoned before Middlesex jury! My God! To stand before the common herd, accused of being no better than a street girl! It is nothing more than a tactic designed by Shaftesbury to provoke me! I'll see that the Chief Justice strikes down the warrant. I am a lady of breeding... I have family and connection... - I am not a harlot! - I know that. They mean to destroy me, Fubs. Shaftesbury has copies of my letters referring to subsidies granted you by the French king. They talk of the secret treaties signed in your name, but there is no proof, thank God. He can be discredited as a liar. The king's position grows weaker every day. He has done everything in his power, but he can no longer defend your conduct. I wrote to the French king on your authority, Your Majesty. - You must stand by me. - You of all people know he cannot do that. Parliament is attacking him through you. His only hope is to cut you adrift. Acknowledge the letters were written on your own initiative. The king knew nothing of them. Parliament already has the scent of blood. I will be torn apart! If you resign, the king may yet come to some understanding with his enemies. I'm guilty of nothing more than obeying Your Majesty's command. These treaties were your creation in every detail! I know nothing of any secret treaty. I have put the king before everything, and you see my reward? Be careful loyalty does not bring you to the same end! Danby must pay the full price for his treason. (CHARLES) He has resigned. That is penalty enough. I have granted him a pardon for any offence he might have committed. You cannot do that. You have dragged a loyal servant down into the mud. I will not permit you to murder him into the bargain! There are thousands of your loyal subjects in the streets in protest at this Popish plot. We can only guess at what chaos will follow if you save the traitor Danby and allow a Catholic to succeed you on the throne. The people have been greatly excited by false rumours and accusations. You know that better than anyone, George. The peace of the country demands the Duke of York's removal from the succession. The peace of the country has always been my most pressing concern. Then name Monmouth as your heir. You must sign the bill excluding your brother from the throne. - Parliament has yet to pass such a bill. - It will. There can be no doubt of that. Accept what must be, sir. You have no choice but to abandon the Duke of York. He cannot defy the will of Parliament for ever. I will make him crawl to the House begging for exclusion. He is in a game he knows he cannot win. It is a question of WHEN he gives in, not if. Perhaps we must remind him of that. The mob yearns for blood. Very well. The mob must have it. Your Majesty... I come not as your king, Lord Stafford, but as your friend. And as your friend... I urge you to confess yourself guilty to the verdict of treason found against you. I'm innocent of any crime against Your Majesty in thought, word or deed. - I know that. - Then how can I say otherwise? Confess now and your life can be spared. A few false words... and in a year or two, a few months perhaps, you can return home to your daughter. I would be disgraced, condemned as a traitor from my own lips. All honest men would know the truth. I've been a loyal servant to your martyred father and to Your Majesty all my life... and that is how I shall die. You must sign. - It is the king's prerogative to grant mercy. - Not in such a case. What is a king, then... if he has no power? It is in order to preserve your power that you must sign. The whole of England is baying for Stafford's blood. If you do not give them what they want, they will turn their anger on you. Lord Stafford has been found guilty by the courts. Oates's lies condemned him. If you overturn the law, you give Parliament an excuse to do the same. That path leads to war and rebellion. Is that what we have come to? An innocent man must be sacrificed to preserve the sanctity of the law? Your father chose open defiance of Parliament, and the outcome was his own destruction. You must be more subtle than him. May God forgive me. God will understand. You have more confidence in him than I. My beloved daughter, your father has this comfort. I die totally innocent of what I am accused, and confident of God's mercy. You must take solace in that, as I do. You summoned me, sir? I've had many accounts of your progress about the country. I'm told that wherever you go, you are greeted as a king. Is it my fault if the people wish to express affection for me? You little fool! Can you not see how you are dancing to Shaftesbury's tune? - Do not treat me like a child! - You could not be more of a rebel if you took up arms and marched on Whitehall! You will never be king! Understand that, and you'll be happy. Dispute it, and you will die a miserable traitor's death. You lack experience and wisdom. But now you must do as I say. You will go to your cousin Mary in Holland... and stay there till I call for you. - I will do anything you tell me, Father. I would sooner die than insult you. On no account return to the court until I summon you, do you understand? Of all my children, you are the first and most beloved. Obey me... and we'll both be content. I never thought to see my oldest friend in the ranks of my enemy. It is a matter of politics. My personal feelings are of no importance. Personal feelings are everything to you. Shaftesbury has only the people's good at heart. He has no grievance against you. He is sincere in his convictions, but when did overturning kings become a pastime of yours? Perhaps when the king betrayed England for 30 pieces of French silver. - Your name was on the French treaty. - I did what was required of a good servant, and what did I receive in return? Lies, deception, the elevation of others above me in your government! We two together could have ruled Europe, let alone England! But you never trusted me as I deserved. Trust and good government cannot live side by side. You neglected me in favour of worthless placemen. I've forgiven your many betrayals... your schemes and your plots... because in my heart, I knew you loved me. But now I see you always loved yourself more. And I find I am a jealous king. I must have unconditional love or nothing. You have a need for sycophancy, not love. And those who rely on flatterers for their comfort are condemned to live and die alone. Tell your master Shaftesbury to summon Parliament. I will address the House. Then you accept the exclusion of your brother from the throne? What must be must be. Goodbye, George. I received your message. Is it time? Be brave, Charles. What if the king means to fight as his father did? He has too much intelligence and too few principles for that. And unlike his father, he knows when a battle is lost! Talk of the exclusion of the Duke of York from the rightful succession is treason. Any who speak of it set themselves against legitimate authority, and are the heirs in spirit to those rebels who so recently plunged our country into rebellion and civil war. Can anyone here contemplate such evil without horror? Let there be no confusion. The Duke of York is my heir and will remain so. His right is ordained by God, and no man may alter it. Anyone who denies this truth makes themselves an enemy of God, king and country. Think on that before you take another step towards chaos. All the world may see what a point we have come to. Nothing that begins in such division is likely to end well. I declare Parliament dissolved. Gentlemen, go home. I will not trouble you any further. What is happening? What did the king say? It is not what he said. It is what he is. England has chosen to trust the superstition of kings rather than the wisdom of its own judgment. He has dissolved Parliament and will rule in his own right. Exclusion and Parliament are finished with. Our time will come. Not today... but soon enough, though I will not live to see it. Wait here to be arrested... or make your peace with the king if you can. For my part, I am weary of Whitehall. I have neglected my wife these last 20 years. I think it is time I went home. He is never too busy to see me. The king gave you no authority to return from exile. Such defiance is treason. If you are still in England at dawn tomorrow morning, you will be arrested. How long? How long before I can come back? Never. Which tie would sir like to wear now? Spoilt for choice. So bloody wonderfully spoilt for choice. (MUSIC: HANDEL'S "MESSIAH") Missing Melinda? Yes. - She didn't go home to escape the war? - No. You were too much in love. No one steps back from love. Not even if there's a war on your doorstep. It was something I told her. What did you tell her? I told her about me. About what you do? Yes. I don't want you to tell anyone else about this. Don't tell Moscow. We can deal with this. Can't we? Can't we? This is highly irregular. What is it? - Has something happened? - Yes. You seem a little nervous. One of our mutual friends in trouble? I just wanted you to know there are no British agents working inside Russia. None. Anything else? I want out. I want to stop working for British Intelligence. I'm more tired than it's possible to be and my nerves are shot. - Moscow doesn't let well-placed men leave. - Unless they're better-placed elsewhere. - For example? - The royal family, chatting with the King. We've lost a man, or rather, he's in limbo. He worked for us, then he went quiet. You've changed the subject. We think he may have access to very important secrets and the responsibility has affected him. It can happen. A weaker man than you. Where is he? His name is Cairncross and he's working in Bletchley Park. I wonder if you might dig him up and see how he's feeling. If you did a good job, Moscow would look favorably on your request. I'm getting nods and winks. I think promotion is in the air. - Anthony? - I'm being followed. - Are you sure? - No, not entirely. Will you do something for me? Moscow wants me to visit a friend who's gone quiet. - Where? - Bletchley. Tomorrow. I want you to follow me. And see who else is forming a queue behind Anthony Blunt. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Mind the doors! Stand clear! Mind the doors! - I know who they are. - Is the game up? Are they MI5? They're Soviet, Anthony. They're Soviet. Bletchley is half a mile from here. Is there anything you said that could have been misinterpreted? - No. Nothing. - I don't understand. Why? - The look on his face. - Who? What? Henry. When I told him Britain had no agents inside Russia. His look was disbelief. - But it's true. - I know it's true. But Moscow has an ego that doesn't believe that Britain isn't paying them attention. - They think we're lying? - Feeding them disinformation. - They think we might be... - Double-crossing them. Moles? What do we do? Tell them we're not? No. We'll make sure we get the biggest secret there is and pass it on. If a gift is large enough, it always comes with love, and they'll see that. I know why you're here. It must be a lonely life. 12-hour shifts of code breaking and then back here to the gas fire and the crossword and damp bread for tea. You won't get at me. I've made my mind up. Are you thinking straight? Codes, codes, codes. It must dominate the mind. It's very simple. The Red Army is hopelessly infiltrated by German spies. If we tell the Soviets what we're getting from Enigma, the Germans will pick it up. Have you seen the casualty figures? 30,000 a week on the Eastern front. 30,000 Russians every week. I think there's a moral obligation to help them. But I understand. Your world is small. I don't blame you for not seeing the moral perspective. It's winning us the war! Breaking the code. We know so much about what the Germans are doing, and if the Germans find out and change the code... that would damage us very, very badly. Us? The 30,000 are us too. Aren't they? If the average Russian weren't prepared to die fighting the Fascists, Hitler would be in Downing Street now. Churchill doesn't mind if Russians die in their millions because they're not "us". That's his moral perspective. "Let the Reds die." The answer is no. I won't do it. That's my choice. The answer is not no. The answer is you made a bigger choice some time ago to work for Moscow to fight Fascism. And that doesn't go away...ever. I hope you understand that. - Are you threatening me? - Of course. Of course I am. Not tonight, Jack. - It used to be so exciting. - Sex? - Spying. - I don't like that word. It's so underhand. Excitement was one of the main reasons for doing it - apart from the good reason. The whiff of danger, all that. I think I've been running away from boredom all my life. A flight from ennui. - It's funny... - Funny? You, I talk to. Is it getting too much? Anthony... Is it? Look at me. Look at me. Melinda. I lost the baby, Donald. He died. - He was born and he died. - He? - We missed you yesterday. - I went to see an old friend who's unwell. Would you mind, Angleton? Walter Krivitsky. He's with the Soviet Embassy in Washington. - Or he was. - Where is he now? He's coming over to us and we've got a taster. We've got a mole inside the British intelligence services. Does he give a name? A tall, fair Scot with bohemian tastes from a well-to-do family. - No name? - Not yet. - Is he the real thing? - We're checking. We have Krivitsky holed up in a hotel in Washington. A tall, fair Scot. Bohemian tastes. Any ideas? Can I have a look at the file? Krivitsky. To D-Day - the start of the end of the war. - I didn't know you two knew each other. - Americans in London. We're a couple of swells, we stay in the best ho... Hello, darling. - Drink? - Uh-huh. Happy again. Dangerous thing - happiness. - We should have dinner. - Donald's very busy. - Just the two of us. - He's the jealous type. So tell him you're meeting a woman. How about it, Melinda? A couple of swells and a hell of a dame. (MELINDA) Kim. Excuse me. What was all that about today at the office? - It's secret. - Secret? It must be something big if the Yank is not permitted to know. But not so secret that Mr. Blunt can't hear it. - A tall, fair Scot with bohemian tastes. - Donald. Donald. Krivitsky will have to be taken care of. Few people know of his intended defection and I'm one of the few. If he is "taken care of", some others - not many - and me. We have no choice. If he identifies Donald, we all go down. We're like skittles - one goes, we all go. - The domino effect. - Dominoes, skittles - we fall together. No choice, Kim. We're in this together. Moscow will have to be told. And don't tell Donald. You look like a ghost walked through you. Cheer up, Anthony. It could be worse. I need to pass water. Shut up, can you? Just shut up. You always kept parts of your life in separate compartments. Painting, spying, sex...royalty. You can close a compartment down and it's as if it's never been there. But this time it's your friends that you're trying to close down. And they don't belong in one of your compartments. They're your heart. You're closing down your heart. That's the end of life. - Guy... - Top secret. Private. - Guy... - Quick. Out. Whelk? Don't you Soviets understand English any more? Would you like a fucking whelk? Do you know what that is? A list of agents we're dropping into Albania by parachute. Where, when, who. And it's all yours, Boris. So Moscow can arrange to catch them as they fall. Bumpy landing, eh, Boris? Out of the sky and into the arms of death. Bump 'em off, Boris! Bump-bloody-bump! Walter Krivitsky, Washington. Your embassy thinks he's on leave, but he's in a hotel. If the Americans think he's the real thing, he'll defect. You know which hotel? Yes, I do. We're grateful. Moscow is grateful. Thank you. There is something delicate we would like you to undertake on our behalf. It's a retrieval job. And it concerns the Duke of Windsor - my fool brother - and some letters he wrote to a relative in Germany. What kind of letters? Letters that speak of his love for Germany and his... fondness for Herr Hitler. Letters we should like to have under our control. It would be an honor. Here's a note authorizing you to take possession of the letters. I know that we can rely upon your finesse in retrieving them and your tact once you have brought them home. - The hush-hush work... - If you do this for us... it will be the last hush-hush thing you do. I shall see to that. I don't care if the Queen of Sheba has given you authorization. This castle is American territory in Germany and we decide what stays and what goes. - Would you at least call your HQ? - This is my HQ. Then call your commanding officer. Wait there. - Head for the attic. - Why the attic? Aristocratic families are all the same - secrets at the top of the house. Bad news, I'm afraid. My CO says nothing leaves. I understand. I quite understand. Has anyone ever told you how beautiful you are? We are very grateful. We should like you to accept a position. Surveyor of the King's Pictures. Welcome to the family. - Did you manage to...? - No more hush-hush. Thank you, sir. - Safer life in art. - Yes, sir. Much safer. (DOOR CRASHES) (LOUD JAZZ MUSIC ON RADIO ) You heard? - Suicide. There was a note. - Three young children left. - You should have looked after him better. - What? He was in Washington. He was your man. You let him slip. You Americans have got a lot to learn. - James Jesus Angleton. - What about him? - Haven't you noticed? - What? - I think he's keen on Melinda. - Aren't you becoming a little paranoid? (JAZZ MUSIC QUIETLY PLAYS) I've got something to tell you. - I've made us safe - all of us. - What do you mean? The one thing about this country of ours is that we have a royal family who are loved and cherished by all. Nothing can be allowed to tarnish their image. Windsor cosying up to Adolf? The nation couldn't bear it. The Duke and the Fuhrer cheek to cheek would break our heart. What are you getting at, Anthony? I went to Germany and I took photographs of some letters - letters that suggest the Duke and the Fuhrer were very good friends. If someone were to suggest that any of us might be traitors... I'd be perfectly happy to whip out the photographs. I think they'd dissuade any prosecution. We're safe. Brilliant! Come on, you. I'm in with the King. - The Kremlin's interested... - Tittle tattle. They want me to spend more time with the Windsors. How much more time? All of my time. My God. My God, you're backing out, aren't you? You've lost your nerve, haven't you? Anthony? - Anthony. Tell me I'm wrong... - I've made you safe, Kim. Safe? ! You've left me in charge of two mewling infants! I trusted you. I gave you all my trust. We trusted each other. I had a man killed to keep us safe and what have you done? You've smashed it up! One fucking skittle has taken a walk. You bloody fool. You bloody, bloody fool. (ALL SING) For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow And so say all of us... Give me 15 seconds. Let's talk about it. - Do excuse me. Wait here. - What? Hello, Colonel. - Blunt. - Fancy bumping into you. - Haven't seen each other since... - I packed in the hush-hush. Can't fathom a man giving it up for art. Never trust a man who looks down his nose at art. Although, looking down your nose, you arrive at your moustache and can't see much at all. - Are you trying to be funny or insulting? - Insulting. I'd finished in hush-hush, so I packed it in. Finished what? Passing the name of every MI5 agent onto the Russians. Good to see you, Winter. - About now, he should be telling Liddell. - If Liddell trusts us. - He does. - As a Cambridge man. If every security issue goes through Liddell, he'll block anything awkward. - We're safe. - Liddell the road block. Anthony Blunt's been passing the names of our agents to the Russians. What? ! Says who? - What? - Says Anthony Blunt. He told the Colonel. Pompous fool, Winter. Wouldn't spot a tongue in a cheek in a million years. - Fool. - He wants me to pass it to the headmaster. - Will you? - Of course not. Make me look an idiot. - Moscow is pleased. - Good. Donald Maclean has been posted to Washington. Stop telling me what I know and tell me what you want to say. You and Mrs. Maclean are friends. She likes you. - I want you to suggest something to her. - What? That she spends some time in New York with her family. Maclean needs to be run by our best man, and he's in New York, so Maclean will have to visit New York. - A wife in Manhattan is perfect cover. - But you need her to agree. We think you might be in a position to persuade her. So how's married life? I bet she knows the difference between cottage pie and shepherd's pie and can quote from all of England's best-loved poems. Am I right? Have you married someone who irons your underpants? Do you think it's possible to love two people at the same time? I think it's possible to be two people at the same time. I'm scared, Kim. - Why? - I'm pregnant again. - Why does that scare you? - Donald. It's hard enough for him as it is. Becoming a father, having a child, will make it harder still. Do you forget sometimes which is which? The real and the secret? Your question assumes that the two are not the same thing. It might be an idea for you to spend some time apart from Donald. - He'd hate it. He's drinking a lot... - I'm thinking of you, Melinda. Why don't you have the baby in New York? Be with your family. Donald can come over from Washington at weekends. You're very kind to me. Am I safe, Kim? People like me - wives and outsiders - we're not supposed to know, and if we do know, we're a threat, aren't we? Moscow doesn't know. Why not? I haven't told them. That's a kind of betrayal, isn't it? It's the first time I've lied to them. I should go. What's the difference between cottage pie and shepherd's pie? Cottage pie is beef, shepherd's pie is lamb. - Do you believe in ironing underpants? - Absolutely. What is this? "Stand the church clock still at ten to three..." "And is there honey still for tea?" Lights out. - You're highly regarded. - Thank you. So alongside attending all those interminable Embassy drinks parties, I want you to do an important job for me. Yes, Ambassador. Secretary to the Joint Policy Committee on Atomic Development. The bomb. The bombs. Make it your bag, Donald. I want a good Brit among the Yanks. We should know everything they know. I'm not sure they agree. - Right. - Be aggressive about what you want to know and listen hard. I won't have the Yanks getting possessive about it. - Come for a drink on Saturday. - I can't, I'm afraid. Oh, yes. Wife in New York. Good idea. Wives and work should be kept separate. Or do I mean wives and life? Yes, I think I do. Life on the one hand and wife on the other. (WOMAN GROANS) Will it be long? (GROANING) - Could we have a minute alone? - Yes. I want us to have a new start. I'm going to tell them I can't do it any more. - Don't make promises you can't keep. - I'm going to do it. I want a normal life. I want to look after my son and not feel that half of me's absent. I have to go. Do you? I'm going to tell them it's over. There's something I want to say. My wife had a baby today. Let's make the world a better place for him. How do you know it's a boy? You're our most important Are you crazy? You're betting against Billy? - Yeah. Because we're gonna get Billy so drunk tonight that he's not even gonna be able to show up to the game tomorrow. - Ohh. - Right, yeah. - Billy. Jilly! What's up? - 'Sup, boner? - Ha ha, no. You'd be able to tell. - What's up, erection? - I don't have an erection, Jillian. - Oh, Blake, I don't want Billy drinking too much before the game tomorrow, okay? - Oh, yeah, me neither. - Shut up! God, no wonder you have cats instead of kids. Go wait outside until I'm ready to leave. - Cats are kids. "Kiddens." - Billy! flaughs] - What up? What's up, man? - Buh-buh-Billy boy! What it is, what it is, what it should be. - Did you bring some jimmy hats, my main man? - Hell, no! - Oh, yes, nice. - Whoa. - No fear, I like that. I also like the clothing company. I have a shirt. I'll give it to you. "Second place, first loser." - Strong shirt. - Okay, all right, what the hell are you guys talking about? Where are the chicks? You guys promised me I'd get to fuck to completion tonight. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. They're coming, and, uh, to put it in laid-man's terms, he's gettin' laid, man. Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

Warms the fucking cockles. What the fuck are you doing here? The missus caught me eating one of her chocolate bars out of the cleaning lady's vagina. That's disgusting. No, it was delicious. It was Marilyn Manson's idea. Once upon a time, according to rock legend, mind you, Mick Jagger was caught eating a chocolate bar out of Marianne Faithfull's warm, gooey center. Bowie was there too. Of course now they all swear it never happened. But I felt like I should try it at least once. I'm actually surprised it's taken me this long. By the by, Atticus, just any idea how long you might be staying? I hadn't really thought about it. It could be quite a while, though. She was fucking furious. Almost cut my dick off. Is this gonna be a problem, Runkle? No. I just-- you know, I thought you might be more comfortable at a hotel. Why would I be more comfortable paying for posh lodgings when I can stay with my manager? For free. Makes sense to me. Tell me, will... Krull be staying too? Of course. He's my road manager. Anytime I leave my house, I'm technically on the road. Krull gets me from point "A" to point "B" and knows where to find all my favorite creature comforts along the way. Where's the shitter in this place? Ooh. Yeah, go easy, big fella. - Low-flow toilets. - Hey. - We should have a party. - Why? I'm newly single. You've just had a major creative breakthrough. We should fucking celebrate. One should mark such fucking milestones. You know, that's not really a bad idea, Hank. The last big party I had here was filled with smelly leather boys. Couldn't really wash the stink off the joint. Okay, well, where's the master? I'm gonna rest up for tonight's shindig. Follow the Krull. Oh, and, Runkle, can you get a piano delivered? And make sure there's heaps of alcohol and cocaine and Mars bars and Astroglide. Brilliant work, Hank. I'm gonna go put this under my pillow and do some dream-writing.

You performed fellatio in the White House? Shh, it's not appropriate, but yes. I had an experience with a gent once. He was quite pretty. Showed up in the backstage area. Fooled the road crew. Sure as hell fooled me. He gave a lovely blow job. I reached into his knickers, felt what I initially thought to be a slightly oversized female clitoris, but, no, it was a gentleman's short, but quite broad penis. I thought to myself, "What would Bowie do?" And then I gave up and got security to beat him senseless. And then I felt sorry for him and let him blow me again.

But they came back, and if I'm going to star in a traditional love story, I need to remember what it's like to come again with a woman. And, by the way, what's the deal with this party? 'Cause seems like it's a little bit of a sausage fest. Yeah, Runkle. Where are the girls? I'm sorry. What do you mean? I said we should have a party. Did you expect me to send out the fucking invites, you senseless wanker? And what about the drugs? - Where are the drugs? - Okay. Atticus, well, we had good luck with the chocolate bars and the Astroglide, but there was a little bit of a problem with the drugs. Fuckin' fuck, Runkle. Jesus. Aah! Was that a banana? I want drugs. I want some fucking girls and some fucking drugs. Drugs. - Whoo! - Hey. Hi. - Hank Moody. - Boom. Hey. How's my suit? - It's aspirational. - Ah. Gonna fit in that fucker one day. Excellent, exce-- good luck with that. You know, you don't have to be so fucking snarky. Slow and steady wins the race, asshole. I'll fit in that suit before you grow your fucking hair back. Boom! - Frank. - Widow. Come here. And if it isn't the bloody warlock who turned me bum into the happiest place on earth. I've missed you, you dirty, bald bastard, you. Nice to see you, Trudy. - How you been? - I've been well. - I've been well, you know. - Good. Thinking about finding me a new husband. Oh, really? Tony left me in financial shambles. You know. I mean, we spent it as fast as he made it. I don't know if he's marriage material, but Eddie Nero right over here is looking to bust a big, fat load after being celibate for quite some time. - Really? - Maybe you two could help - each other out. - Oh, no. He's a little too pretty for me. And he poops on people. Blue eyes poops on people. You're into the scat-play, huh? Poop! It was a phase but a messy phase. I've been there once or twice. I have. Real messy. Speaking of dirty, what do you say, Popeye? You ready to bust one out of the chamber, so we can sit back, relax, and enjoy the party? Don't mind if I do. Yay. Attaboy. Poop, poop. ♪ Stop. Don't stop. Stop. I'm almost done. Fuck. This is good, Hank. Almost makes me want to jump your bones. Almost? What else-- I got a typewriter right here. Damn. Thank you. Well, your thoughts, and the kind, thoughtful, long-legged manner in which you chose to express them, had much to do with the end result. Well, it leaves you with the same feeling that a real great song does. Sadly, I think my work here is done. What? No more sexy time? Say it ain't so. Well, too much leads to too much. Sooner or later, someone gets hurt. Yeah, well, you're right. You should probably do your best not to fall in love with me. I wasn't worried about me. No, no, be careful. I have a tendency to take root in the hearts and minds of those who initially find me off-putting. It's a small, but loyal group. Well, everything put together falls apart, Hank. - Paul Simon. - Very good. No, that was easy for me. Know why? - Why? - 'Cause I'm old as dirt. Oh. Oh, come here. - You're not so old. - Oh, sweet talker. Oh, my back. My back. Oh, jeez. I've never been sodomized in a child's nursery before. - What fun. - That's odd. Oh, hey, you two. Hey. Oh, this is Trudy. This is Marcy and Karen. This is Trudy, and Trudy was recently widowed. It's true. I was. - Yeah, my hubby O.D.'d. - Oh, sorry. But Jean-Luc Picard here has been keeping me company. - Jean-Luc Picard. - Right? He's not too big in the lap, you see, but he's enthusiastic, if you know what I'm saying. Yeah, I know what you're saying. Hey. I thought you said they weren't coming. They said they weren't coming. Here they are. - Good. - Yeah. We got bored, we smoked weed, and we wanted to meet Atticus Fetch, yeah! You should. You should. You should have sex with him. Both of you. He's single now, and he's quite good in the sack, you know. A little lazy when it comes to the oral return favors and such. - Unlike the ass whisperer here. - That's me! He gives as good as he gets, he does. Oh, that's not exactly my experience. Hey. Have you ever done Atticus before? Uh, no, I have not had the pleasure. We should do him together. We could. Or we could go get a drink right--right now. Whatever you think, love. Marcy, let me introduce you to Atticus. No. Allow me. Okay. Whichever one. Lead the way. I see you have a new friend. Yes, and she's--and that's what she is, a friend. She's a lovely young woman who has helped guide me creatively. Right. I'm sure. Sort of a Florence Nightingale in your time of need... - Oh. - Kind of thing. Well, you know what, I'm happy to see that I can still get a jealous rise out of you. But you just say the word, and I will stop the world and melt with you. Yeah, I said that. Oh. - You remember Eddie. Karen. - Hi, hey. Karen, you remember Yusuf Nero? Of course. The last time we were together, you were seeing that handsome African-American fellow. No, that was just a phase, like you pooping on people. I had a feeling that was a passing thing. A milk chocolate mandingo fantasy. Perfectly normal. You're entitled. Particularly after the hell that this lunatic's put you through. Oh, okay, well, speaking of lunatics, you know, Karen was recently married to a pansexual loon named Richard Bates, the writer. - You know him? - Are you kidding me? He's the man I took in my mouth. - Of course he is. - Richard Bates. He wrote the definitive draft of John, the Michael Mann movie that won me the Academy Award for Best Actor, but it's not about the kudos. - It's about the work. - Of course not. - Karen. - Mm-hmm. It has been many years since we've seen each other, and yet you have not aged a day. Your stems, your hindquarters remain glorious. Your skin is flawless. You are a beautiful woman. Well, thank you, Eddie. - You will do perfectly. - Whoa, whoa. - Watch it, Nero. - Eddie needs my help. Your effluvium is delightful, a rare vintage. Come, allow me to seduce you. Now fuck off. Go away. Well, we tried. Krull. Sorry. The one thing I know about Atticus is he loves his fans, and we've got a great, big one right here who would very much like to say, "Hello." And what's this big fan gonna do with me? Hey, you. I'm somebody's mother. Yeah, but you're not mine, love. How about a bit of suction? Allow me to handle this. Hmm. Allow me to handle this. ♪ Well, it looks like we found the party. - Hello, girls. - Who is this? Oh, please, Atticus, let me introduce you - to my ex-wife. - And mine. And the mother of my child. You were both married to this woman? Yes. Yes, we were. What the fuck's wrong with you? How much time do you have? Marcy. Huge fan. Finally. A fan. She loves the musicians. She had quite a serious fling with Rick Springfield - once upon a time. - Really? You were one of Jesse's girls, were you? Yes. Yes, she was. She even had the ringtone to prove it. Why is it you never mentioned a fling with a major fucking pop star? I don't know, Stu. Maybe it's because you're so fucking jealous. Maybe it's because you need to be the only cock in town. Maybe it's because I fucking love you so much, Marcy. - That is why. - Okay, well, it looks like this meet and greet is over. - Let's go, Marcy. - Yes. Leave her - with me. - Oh, that's probably not a good idea. Yeah, we're happy to stay. You're not actually my type. I usually go for tall, leggy blondes. But you're quite sexual, aren't you? She's incredibly sexual. Built for speed, born to fuck. Sinking into this woman is like swimming in a vat of exquisite oil. Jesus Christ, Stu. A vat? You make me sound like I'm all stretched out and shit. - Shut up! - We had a nice sex life ourselves, you know. It wasn't crazy or anything. - Ugh! Oy. - A finger up the ass every now and again. A botched threesome or two, but it was quite familiar, comforting. You have quite a fan club, don't you? Yeah, looks like I'm queen of the shit pile. Go. Get the fuck out of here. Yeah. Leave your ex-wife with me. Oh. We're gonna have a chat. Okay. Hey. So you and Hank, huh? Once upon a time. And you and Hank. Sorta kinda. Something. - He's really talented. - Yeah. He's talented, but... he has a really hard time sustaining it. Well, I don't know. I think maybe he just needs to find the right motivation. Oh, God, I so know where you're at right now. You just see all this potential, right? Yeah. Yeah. Potential's exciting. Yeah, it is. But it's really hard to have a long-term relationship with someone else's potential. Especially if that is what you're looking for. I'd be careful if I was you. And I kind of was you. You're gonna get hurt. ♪ Methinks you like this one, Faith. What do you think? She likes him. I can tell. Who, Hank? Yeah. I like him. I like him as much as any guy that I choose to spend my time with. I've seen you on the arm of lots of guys. You seem to have a real connection with this one. He's a good guy. He's sweet to you. Maybe it could be a real thing. You do not have to live happily ever after with someone to make it real. Oh, be good to yourself, Faith. You deserve it. Shut up and deal. If I had to pick, I would say Fetch Live, All Over Your Face because that one has all your hits. That's lovely, dear. So would you like to blow me, or would you prefer to have actual intercourse? God. Jeez. I don't know. I hadn't really thought about it, so... That's cute. Of course you thought about it. Mm. Do you want to go down on me? Mm. I'd prefer not to. It's a little bit intimate and also, to be honest, a little bit boring for me. Of course, because I'm just another bang to you. - Yeah. - Not at all. The knowledge that I'm giving you this gift, this opportunity to transcend your everyday suburban existence and have sex with a fucking rock star, thereby giving you a story to dine out on for years to come, that's the fun bit for me. I don't know, man. This is just so fucked up. I mean, just-- just take me, okay? I mean, that's what Rick Springfield would have done. He just tore my clothes off and stuck it in, so just fucking do what you want, but just fucking do it already, all right? Just fucking go. Go. Hey, you guys. Hey, did you read that Times article about the guy who did the thing, and then this other thing happened? I don't know about you, but I found it fascinating. Hank, I am having an intimate moment with Karen, and I will not let you spoil it with your incessant verbal diarrhea. What is it, Hank? Are you not getting enough attention? Where is he? Where's Atticus? I haven't the foggiest, my love. Okay, well, I'm prepared to forgive him. - Why? - Well, here I was, all pissed off, calling every divorce lawyer I know, and look what come in the mail. Three, count 'em, three seven-figure royalty checks. Oh, cool. I'm so lucky. My life's fucking amazing. I mean, if he wants to eat a Mars bar out of some dirty skank's poontang, who am I to judge, hmm? Well, that is a beautiful rationalization, but I think in this case you have a right to be slightly miffed. Oh, darling, it's just sex. Why does everyone make such a big deal about it? Fuck if I know, dude. - Move. - Sorry, missus, I can't do that. Sorry, missus, I can't do that. Hello, darling. Oh. Is all forgiven? You fucking fuckface. Fuck! Are those my royalty checks? Get out of my way. I'm sorry. Ugh. Come on. Enough of this foolish cat-and-mouse game. You are gonna fuck my brains out, and you're gonna fuck 'em out now. No means no, you know. You say no, but your cock here - begs to differ. - No, don't listen to him. He does not have decision-making authority. Do you know what it takes - to be a rock star's wife, Hank? - No. I have certain skills. I know how to give the kind of sharp and focused head that cuts through the bullshit. - Sharp? - Plenty of women out there all are licking lollipops. They're lazy. They're entitled. They think just by putting it in their mouth, that's all they need to do, but you and I know - that's just the beginning. - Right. I know how to get shit done. Now your cock's on the verge of making a decision, Hank. What's it gonna be? - Everything okay in here? - Things are not as they seem. Can you give us a fucking minute here? - You don't want to do this. - I do. No, no, no. You love your husband. - I do. - Yeah. These are not the droids you're looking for. Fuck. Ah, fuck. Ugh, Jesus. Whoo! Thank you. That was perfect timing. I had a feeling you might need a little rescuing. Yeah. - What? - Hmm. Fuck. - I get it. - Sorry. You should go. Go, go, go. Karen. Karen, this is bullshit. He poops on people. Maybe not anymore, but he has in the past, and that is--that's a serious fucking character flaw. They've been in there a really long time. Maybe they're just talking. You know, like we're just talking. Sure. - Right. Just talking. - Yeah. My advice, just fucking move on, dude. I'm not sure that's possible. You can't begrudge your lady for going off with Eddie Nero. Dude's fucking handsome. Yeah, but Karen's not like that. What kind of fucked up Madonna whore shit is that? What, just 'cause you love her, just 'cause she crapped out your kid, she's not entitled to bang a movie star? Well, sure she can, but that doesn't mean I can't be majorly pissed off about it. Okay. Then play it cool, man. That's the move. Never let the bitches see you sweat. Moody. That woman is amazing. Ow! Not the face. Never the face. You hit me in my face. That's a national treasure. That's an act of treason. Oh! Motherfucker! - Come on. - I think I pulled a hammie. Cocksucker. Son of a shitty, fucking-- Now the drunken master. Fuck, get away from my fucking table! God damn it. Fuck. Oh, shit. Now it begins. Okay, then. Ladies and gentlemen, yes, I have an announcement to make. I have fucked up this storied life something proper. All my life, I have loved exactly one woman with all my heart. Have I fucked countless others? Yes. Does that make me a bad man? I-I don't think so. But, in the court of public opinion, I am a scoundrel, a rogue, a rake. Perhaps even a rapscallion. But the fact is I can't live without you, Natalie. Olly, no, put the fucking gun down. - Olly. Put it down. - Olly? Really? Olly? Did you really think he was born Atticus Fetch? It's true, Hank. I had to create Atticus Fetch. And now I have to kill him before he kills me. That doesn't make any sense. No, it makes a lot of sense actually. Yeah, he created a monster, and now he wants to kill the monster before the monster kills him. I mean, I've felt that way myself. I'm sure a lot of people have. You're not alone, Atticus. Um, I'm sure we can work it all out. Wait, does that mean you'll take me back? Fuck no. You're a lying, cheating, fucking scumbag. Wah! - Okay, I'll take you back. - Really? - You will? - We'll figure it out, doll. I'm just gonna have to keep you on a very short leash. That sounds good. I like the sound of that. That's what this boy needs, some discipline, - a little mother's discipline. - Mommy's discipline. Okay, now, just give me the gun. Give mama the gun. Come on. Come on. There we go. Ow! Why did you hit me? It's not even fucking loaded, you pussy. Can you slow down? I don't know why you're so fucking angry. I'm not the one who disappeared into the bedroom with that fucking weirdo degenerate. You've got a fucking nerve to take issue with anything I do ever. Yes, no, I-- you're right, but what am I supposed to do, just sit there and watch it happen? Karen, why the fuck did you come here tonight anyway? You know why? Because there's always this voice in the back of my head that says, "Maybe this time it will be different. "Maybe the stars will align, "and there will be this magic moment between us where everything will be okay again." But there's always something or someone in the way. Karen, you want me not to see anybody else, just say the word. But if you keep me at arm's length, what am I supposed to do, just sit around with a cock cage on and hope that you're gonna have some kind of epiphany about us? Do you honestly think that I care about you fucking someone else? If we're not together, I don't expect you to have taken some vow of celibacy. It's just, when I see someone look at you the way that I used to look at you, I fucking hate that. It makes me sick to my stomach. ♪ And nothing else matters ♪ And the worst part of it is that I turned into you tonight. I-I don't want to be that person. I don't want to start playing games and, like, trying to get back at you and trying to hurt you. I don't want that either. ♪ For a different view ♪ and nothing else matters == sync, corrected by elderman == You know, we have all this time together and he just doesn't like me.

I think we just need time apart. I am still in love with Sarah, and I'm planning on taking her back. I know what I want. He knows what he wants. You gotta figure out what you want. - Honey... - Yep. What's the name of that restaurant you're always talking about that you want to eat at in the city, the French joint? Oh, uh, Cafe des nuits. - Cafe des nuits. - It's so good. I want to go there. Jabbar. You know what would be great, is to go there and eat at the chef's table. I hear that's the thing to do. Ooh, yeah. Yeah, I heard that's super cool. Yeah, I heard it's super cool, super expensive, and really hard to get a reservation. Yeah. Not to mention you go there and eat all this amazing food... - Mm-hmm. - Drink amazing wine, then you gotta sit on the bridge in traffic on the way home. - Yeah. - It's, like, not even worth it. Yeah. Unless, of course-- now, this is crazy talk, but, like, maybe if you had a suite at the W hotel, overlooking the bay. Then maybe it would almost be worth it to go. Yeah, maybe. Well, we would need something really important to celebrate, though, in order to justify that expense. You know, I can't even think of what it could be. Like, maybe like an anniversary or something. - Our anniversary. - Like a one-year anniversary. - That's what I got us! - No, you didn't. Yes, I did. We're gonna eat there, and we're gonna stay at the W in our fat suite, - and it's gonna... - Baby! be amazing and romantic. You're so good. Oh. Well, what about Jabbar? We need a babysitter. I mean, she's living here for free. She can at least baby-sit. - It's like the one silver lining. - Yeah, but you messed that up when you didn't apologize to her like I asked you to. - I'm not getting into all that. - Well, yeah-- - She's gonna be ecstatic. - No, she's not. I'm gonna be out of the house for 24 hours. - She's gonna be dancing around-- - Excuse me. She may actually like that. Yes, mom? Jas, um, where is my suitcase? Why do you need your suitcase? I've decided that I'm going to move in with your brother. Mom, come on. You don't have to do this. - I know. - His place is too small. - It'll be fine. - You don't have to leave. It'll be fine. I would prefer to be someplace where I'm wanted. - You are wanted. - Okay. You're wanted, right? I just would like you to get me my suitcase, please. Thank you. Good morning, Crosby. Good morning. Are you still gonna ask her, though, about babysitting? - You know what? Pfft. - What? I'm just teasing. Hey. Come on. Hey, there's a taxi outside. Yeah, that printer's busted again. It took me like two hours. Gotta get this boarding pass. Boarding pass? Where are you going? I gotta go to Minnesota... - Now? - by the way. Yeah. Can you-- you can just watch-- By the way? Yeah.

I'll be back in like two days. - Okay, bye. - And then, um... - Mm-hmm. - We'll, uh-- you know, we gotta-- we gotta do some talking when I get back. Okay, when you get back. Have a good trip.

So things are looking very, very good. - That's great. - Wonderful. Your tests have come back. Your panels are good. Panels are good. Well, that's great. - That's awesome. - Yeah. That's awesome. So does that mean everything is-- that I'm clear and I'm good to go and-- I think so, yeah. We still have, you know, your final chemo to do. - Right. - After that, I'm gonna schedule you for a P.E.T. Scan. A P.E.T. Scan? What? That's like an M.R.I., right? It's a scan of the entire body. But you just said that everything was clear. Why would I-- Wait, so is that just a precautionary thing? Why would I need a P.E.T. Scan? Well, a test showed some minor liver blood abnormalities. We think it's probably from the drugs. But just to be safe, it's something that we need to do. Okay. So wait, are you-- Is it possible that the cancer could've spread somewhere else in my body? - I just said-- - He said he doesn't think - he's gonna find anything. - Right. This is minor, maybe from the drugs. It's just something that's important for us to do once you've finished treatment. If there's anything else for us to deal with, we need to know about it. Okay.

You're good. You? S.M.D.H. S.M.D.-- Shaking my damn head. - Hmm. - What? He only speaks in text codes. I don't know. Hey, do you think that smell is permanent, or it's just temporary? What smell? That kind of musty, mother-in-law, guilt-trippy-type smell that seems to be stuck in the sheets. Don't be an idiot. - Hey. - Gimme the sheet. Why are you so upset? She wasn't even that upset. No, she was hurt. That's why. - It didn't read that way to me. - Really? Yeah, it seemed like someone playing the victim. Plus she would love to be at Sekou's house, and he'd love to have her. Right? You're excited to have your mom. I live in a 700-square-foot apartment. Yeah, that's rough. All right, honey, check this out. Ooh, I like this. Chateau du "whit". I think you need to brush up on your French there, Kristina. Clearly, that is chateau "do it". Okay? - Oh, my God, honey. - So that's right there, okay? - You're so corny. - Here you go. Thank you for this. This is really a surprise. - All right. - It's so nice. Yeah. Just wait one second. Let me... Have a little toast. Okay. It's official? To my wife. My husband. Thanks for hanging in there with me. We've had quite a year. - God, we sure have. - I love you. Bottoms up. - Mm. - Ahh. Mm. That is-- That's good. - Thank you very much. - Mm. Mm. Yummy, yum, yum. - What is that? Ow. - What? - Did you hurt yourself? - Ooh, ah, just... - What did you do? - One second. Ooh! Oh. - What? - What could that be? - I don't know. - Well, check it out. Okay. I'm a little scared. - Little surprise. - Cash and prizes? Just a little surprise. - It's Hawaii. - Yep. I know what you're thinking. I checked with Dr. Bedsloe. He said it's fine. Got the whole family ready to take care of Max... - Adam, um, I-- - And Nora and Otis. It's all set. All you have to do-- pack a bathing suit and a good book, honey. I really wish that you would've talked to me before booking this trip. Don't worry about the money. We had a good month at The Luncheonette, okay? We're fine. I'm not worried about that at all, honey. We don't know that I'm healthy. We do, honey. - We don't, no. - We do. - We don't. - I talked to Dr. Bedsloe. Honey, you saw Gwen. You saw what happened to her. - I mean, she was doing fine. - I know. And then, out of nowhere, it just, like-- it came back, - and it's in her lungs. - I know that. I know that. It's everywhere, and she's scared. I feel terrible, and I'm sorry that she's scared, but that's not you. - That's not you. - How do we know that? - We don't know that, Adam. - Yes, we do, honey. Listen to me. We don't, okay? Until I have that test, we know nothing. So I'm sorry, but I can't plan a vacation or a trip or go celebrate something... - Okay, I'm sorry. - When I don't know that I'm-- - Okay. - I'm sorry. Let's take a beat. Let's just take a beat. Okay? All right. I want you to cancel the trip. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go check on our nugget. I'll check on her. You don't-- No, it's--babe, it's okay. Thank you so much. All right. Yeah? Hi. Wow. - You look great. - You like it? Yeah, I love that. I just got three new ones at the wig shop. Oh, yeah. Really, uh, sexy. - Brought you some brownies. - Oh. Thank you. Honey, I'm sorry. - Oh, no, no, no. - I'm so sorry. I--no, I overreacted to everything, and-- - I'm sorry. - No, I shouldn't have-- - You didn't do anything wrong. - Honey, I shouldn't have rushed into making Hawaii plans without checking in with you. Okay, most women would love that. It was selfish. I was missing you. I'm... I'm tired of sharing you with... Cancer and everybody else. I just wanted you for myself for a while. Pinky Tuscadero? - Yeah. - Yeah, and The Fonz? I love her. You're The Fonz. Heyyy. I can get you a leather jacket. Hey. - Will you wear it? - Come here. - With no underwear? - Come here. Come here, you. Please? Mm. Hi. - Oh, wow, what's going on in-- - What? - That's good. - Oh, my--geez. What the-- what did you guys-- Didn't mom teach you how to knock? God. You having an afternoon delight - with strawberry shortcake? - All right, okay. You need to warn me about that. - Come on, hit the road, Cros. - What do you need? - Like, 38 seconds? - Get out. How does he know? I'm just kidding. Oh, my God. - Hi. - Hi. Can I come in? Yeah. Yeah, please. I have something to say. Uhhuh? I'm going to try to make it work with Hank. I have to get my life together. I could never explain to you... How much I love you. [T] I'm gonna make it work with Hank. Um... I-I don't-- I don't know what to s-- to say. I'm sorry. Good-bye, Mark. Bye. Takes the snap, and the blitz is on! We've never seen anything like this kid! Okay, hey, careful. Oof! - I'm sorry. - Are you okay? Yeah. I'll-- I'll pay for it. - I told you to be careful. - How much is it? It's expensive. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. You don't have to pay for it. No, no, let's just-- let's just-- how about this? Let's just go back to the no football in the house rule. - Yeah. - Thank you. All right. So you're not gonna change your mind about adopting me? Like, not have the ceremony? No. Okay. I'm never gonna change my mind. Okay. Okay. I want you to stick around. Okay. How've you been feeling? - I'm okay. - Yeah? - Thanks. - Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Thanks for, um... Everything. For being there for me. Yeah, of course. I mean-- you know, I still think about you all the time. Like, constantly. Yeah. Me too. Well, I also wanted to tell you that I got into Berkeley. Whoh, my God. Yeah. - Drew, that's amazing. - It's pretty crazy. I know, I-- it's pretty shocking. It's incredible. Yeah, I got the letter, and the first person I wanted to tell was you. I'm really happy for you. Thank you. I got into Tufts. Are you kidding? Nope. Oh, my gosh. That was, like, in your top three. I know. - Yeah. - That's amazing. - Yeah. - That's in Boston, huh? It is in Boston. Wow. That's awesome, though. Thanks. All right, well, I just wanted to-- to say hi and-- so I guess I should-- should go. All right, well... I'll never forget you. Yeah, I'll never forget you either. - Hi. - Hi. Can I talk to you for a sec? - Yeah. - Okay. I just had to tell you some things. Okay, um... So we haven't talked about this yet, but a few years ago, I was in a car accident. I was drinking, and, uh, it was really bad, you know. And I almost died, and it-- you know, it just made me realize that when you have people in your life that love you, at a certain point, you know, you have to take responsibility for that. And it means something, and it matters. And, you know, I don't know. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I love you. I love you more than I ever thought that I could love anybody. I don't want to waste one more second doing anything without you. And I need to know that you're gonna try to be strong and accept the fact that I love you and try to be responsible for that, because I'm scared, and I don't think that I can do it alone, and I don't know-- You know? Yeah. ♪ Someone hold me ♪ ♪ I'm done with this game ♪ - Okay. - Listen. There's so much in my life that's... Doesn't something sweet. How about that Melrose Pancake House you like? Watching American movies, eating pancakes with syrup and orange juice always comes up. Should I say it's like American style? Sochildish. There's a delicious pancake house on Melrose Avenue. Let's go when we go to LA. Not there, let's go somewhere else. Why? If we go there, she could be there. Who? That girl? Yes. Is it something like a destiny instinct? Do you know how big L.A. is, compared to Seoul? But then, in this wide LA, you and her will be able to meet there? It's just a feeling. And, at this time, if we don't book beforehand, there's no seating. Let's go someplace else. Let's go, whether we see her or not. Since you say that, it makes me want to check if you're right. She really is there. Yoon Chan Young, you've become an American now, huh? When did you make reservations? It's just basics. How did you know this place? Did you search for L.A.'s places to dine? What? Well.. Sure. It's not that you two secretly made an arrangement? Let's go somewhere else. Let's just eat here. I am trying my best to be considerate towards you. You are really annoying since a while ago. Why does avoiding her become a considerate thing for me? Let's just go in. I want to eat here. There are no seats. Then we can just make one. Whether it is coincidence or destiny, I want to check. Did you make a reservation? I have someone waiting. So "White Hacker Yoon" was you. I'm going to take a seat. We will pay. Do you two know each other? From our school. As you can see, we're not that close. It's our first time talking to each other. I had no reason to talk with him, since he's at school on a scholarship for needy people. Get up. Today's our engagement anniversary. So, Kim Tan, You're allowed to eat pancakes if you want. Fine, let's eat. I too want to eat. What is your relationship with each other? We've been friends for a long time. Really? How did you know to come here? Since it's a famous place, that's why you brought her here? No, it's because my friend wanted to come here. Wow. What an incredible coincidence. But my fiance and this girl believe this is fateful.What do you think, Yoon Chan Young? I thought you wanted to eat pancakes. Stop. Since no one is talking. Ah! Then how about this topic? You dated Lee Bo Na, right? Say your greetings. This is Lee Bo Na's present boyfriend. And the ex-boyfriend. Should you say things like that about a person who's not even here? Then why leave Lee Bo Na alone and be here with this girl? It's your mistake in the first place. Wait, no. A man who has a fiancee and a man who has a girlfriend... Is it your biggest mistake that you meet only those men? Yoo Rachel! We will be leaving first. Let's go. What should I do? Should I meddle in? Or shall I pretend not to know? Order.We need to eat and buy my plane ticket. Stay for a few more days. You came all the way here anyway. I should go, I'm worried about my Mom too. I should go back quickly, to start my part-time job in order to repay you. I told you, you can pay me back slowly. That way you look at me is prohibited.We're still in the States. Let go and talk.You were cool enough in front of that girl. Yoo Rachel. What? We first saw each other when we were 10 years old. I thought that you were a genius. A ten year old could speak on the phone in English, and you talked to yourself in Japanese. When you were 14, you liked my brother, right? To me, you said that I was a baby, so you didn't want to deal with me. What is it you want to say? When the mention of our engagement came up, you said this: "You know everyone in our social circle. Do you think there's a better match?" That time, I realized I was so immature. So? During those 8 years, Yoo Rachel, in my memory, has always been smart, pretty.. and mature. But then, You don't seem like much now. Don't be like that. All the more if it's because of me. There's no reason for you to ruin yourself as you put in effort. I'm not worth that much. You said you would be going tomorrow, right? I will go to the hotel at that time. See you tomorrow. Subtitles brought to you by the Heirs Team @Viki Kim Won Oppa? Yoo Rachel. Why are you here? You aren't staying in Yong Do's hotel? Am I crazy to be indebted to that family? Looking at it, you came here avoiding it too. Yeah. It's been a while since I've seen you. Are you doing well? Me... well. Did you meet Tan? If you consider it as having met, I guess I have. You? Me too. If I consider it as having met, I guess I have. Are you going somewhere? Yes, I have to go out for a bit. If its not an important meeting or a date, can I follow you? It's not a place you'll like. It doesn't matter. It would be better than being alone in a hotel room, looking at my phone. The day here is so long, to the point that it makes a person with no plans lonely. It's a bit far. Will you be okay? The further, the better. Who is that? My Mom. Before meeting my dad, my mom was a 'country girl' who made wine and picked oranges. A suffocating chabeol household, pretentious parties... For an American country-girl, Korea must have been too ugly to handle. In the end, she passed away like this. Did she make wine herself? There's a wine named "Won" in our house's wine storage, my mom made it personally, the year I was born. She's cool. Did you ever come here with Tan? No. You're the first person I've ever brought here. Why? Tan will be jealous. Of who? Me? No, of me. It was good that I followed you. I'm glad that that you came with me too, that I didn't have to speak to myself, all alone. Think of this as if you peeked into someone's diary. Yes. I will be staying here for a few more days. Please tell the President that I made a trip to Singamore before arriving here. Oh, I met Tan too.. thanks to you. I hope that you kindly open my schedule to Tan, this time as well. (sarcastically) You don't need to worry. Then I will see you at the airport. Young Do will go to the airport? That's what I told him to do. He would really hate it. Even though he hates it, what can he do? That rascal still can't overthrow me. Don't be so confident, the kids will grow up in no time. Make sure to call me! It's been a while. Yes, it has. How have you been? As well as you've been. That's a bit hard. I heard you're engaged. Is it the one who just got off? Be it 20 years ago or now, I guess it's not you. Congratulations on your engagement. It's a bit strange... Even now when I see you, my heart flutters. I wish it would be the same when you remarry.Be well. Yes? Yes, Secretary Yoon. Has my brother come back to Korea yet? He should be in the plane right now. I understand. I heard you met my son. Me? Who is your son- Ah, I've met him. His name is Chan Young, right? You're Secretary Yoon's son? So you remember? How did you get my number? You placed it in your reply.Give the phone to Cha Eun Sang. She's not with me now. Where did she go? Tell me why you called, I'll relay it to her. Are you her lawyer? I will tell her myself, so call me when she comes. What did he say? There's been no reply? I told them persistently to contact me if ever she contacts them, just like you told me. Right, let's wait.You sister could have had some circumstances. That... I just got a call from him. He told me to let you call. He had something to say. No, I don't want to. By tomorrow, I will have nothing to do with him anyway. What time is your flight tomorrow? Don't you dare! You know how much I've wanted to come here, whether to study abroad or for language learning, right? Skipping school in front of me is just like insulting me! I will go to the airport alone. Hey, I was asking so that I won't go. What? You're dead! ♫ I secretly bite my lower lip, and I slowly close my eyes. ♫ I hide the excitement that's filling my body. ♫ It tickles me for some reason, when I think of you. ♫ I start talking to myself. ♫ Give me a perfect day, or I'll stay by your side. ♫ ♫ I've already let half of my feelings get caught. ♫ A day that will be worth expecting, will come. ♫ Only a lot of good things will come. ♫ Nothing better... better than our love. ♫ One summer night, it was a dream like time. I will disappear now. Just like a dream at night. Goodbye. Thanks sir. Let �s go! I'm uncomfortable going with you. Even if you're uncomfortable, bear with it, since I'm good looking. Go in. Send me a message when you arrive. Don't you have plans of going back to Korea? There's always intentions but I just don't have courage. Do you need courage when you go back to Korea? Yes. I need that. Go ahead and go. I still haven't forgiven you. I really hate you. -I know. Cha Eun Sang! Stop there! Subtitles brought to you by the Heirs Team @Viki Let's consider this as our introductions. Hey! You can't even be added to the family tree! For a person who couldn't even have children. Should we wait and see how well Tan protects his mother from his brother? I said that as always, you were mean and living well on your own. Why the tiger isn't in his own cave... Bring your brother back from his exile. I came back. There will be no such things as what you are worried about. It's not something that an exiled person can decide. This is the place where we will be living. Are you in your right mind? Do you live here? Did Tan's family move? Are you not able to use your eyes now? I'll do it. Oh, will you? You have to earn your meals. I always see a woman's back. She's the housekeeper's daughter. She lives here with us. Subtitles brought to you by The Heirs Team @Viki Episode 3 What are they saying? He said that he came to make sure that no one was coming for her. She said, "If I'm going to trust you, I need to know who you are." You weren't asleep? But... yesterday, he says he met a woman. He says her name is Cha Eun Sang. How do you know my name? However, he says that he's curious about Cha Eun Sang. Possibly... do I like you? Probably not. Why? You're engaged. Despite that... That's... too much like a movie. This is Hollywood. Those kinds of things really do happen. Really? Is this place called Hollywood? What? It's really Hollywood. It's totally amazing! I saw that in a movie. There's no way that's more interesting than what I told you in the theater. I told myself I would definitely go to Hollywood when I visited America. Am I... talking to myself? Even though it looks close, it'll probably be far when we go near it, right? It looks far as well! Go home and wash up first, and take my car. You can't walk there. I'm not going to go. Why? I'll take you there. No. I'm thankful for what you've done for me already. I want to stop being a burden to you. Let's go home, my suitcase is at your house. Which way do you go? Sorry for bothering you, but can you check if there's a reply on my status one last time? I'm really thankful for everything you did for me. Then, goodbye. America? Where in America? I'm also in America. What's the matter? I can get to you right now, so as soon as you see my reply, call me. This is my number. Call me immediately! Where is my suitcase? It was all cracked. How did that happen? Where is it? It is in my bedroom, upstairs. I'm going to take a shower. You can go inside and take it. Just stay until your friend contacts you. That's ok, right? I'm going to go wash up. I ate lunch alone. Let's eat dinner together. Yes, Chief Secretary. There's a family party with the American shareholders, at the farm estate. The Chairman says you should attend it as well. You need to be there by lunchtime, tomorrow. The President should have arrived at the farm by now. Does my brother know that I'm coming, too? The Chairman wants you to go. But my brother... doesn't want me to? If you want to know what the President's thoughts are, then you'll have to go. You'll have to go and ask him in person. My message ends here. Good luck. Thank you. Oh, Father-in-law! It's Ajusshi! You're on vacation - what brings you to school? I'm here to prepare for the short-film festival. What about you, Father-in-law? I had something to take care of at the foundation. Call me Ahjusshi. Since he went to the States, Chan Young seems to have opened his eyes to Western culture. He won't even call me first, and he talks to American girls. I think he's cheating on me. Really? Looks like I've given birth to a really bad guy! How could you say something so harsh like that about my boyfriend! Watch out after Chan Young, he secretly really likes women. No, it's women that just chase after him. Yeah! That Cha Eun Sang or Cha Geum Sang, you know her, right? I don't like her, so don't be nice to her. I hope you leave safely, Father-in-law. Ajusshi! Ajusshi is for Won Bin! Oh, you're here. Are you not going to properly say hello? Hello. (very formal) What's this? Sunbae, please eat. We've been awake since dawn to make it for you. The rolls are from Cheongdamdong, the galbi jjim is from Bangbaedong, modum jun is from Jongno, the salad and dessert cake is from Itaewon. What did you make? Did you wake up early and make the spoon and chopsticks with your sincerity? Also, do you know how many people he needs to feed? Is this all you brought? Ah, seriously. I should seriously set up a broadcasting station for Sunbae or something. It's not like this broadcasting group means much. What? "This sort of broadcasting group"? My dad, he's the CEO of SBC, you know. My dad is the CEO of Mega Entertainment. Should we see if you can afford to set up a broadcasting station after we take out all of our celebrities from SBC? What is this seriously? Let's go. Sunbae, I like everything about you, but I like this the most. What's the reason for today's lunch gifts? It's my 100th day. What? With who? With the college entrance exam. You surprised me. Sit down for a moment. The 10th grade producer says he'll quit. I think his family found out that he was in the broadcasting group. He said he was nervous about that. Come to think of it, you were somehow successful at keeping this a secret from your family for three years. Who knows if I was good at hiding it, or if it was my parents who were good at hiding it. It's a bummer. What are those pills? Vitamins. You'll find out next year. My body doesn't feel like I'm 18 anymore. Oh my god! What's with the bag? Let's go to Hollywood next time, I need to urgently go somewhere. What is it? Something bad? Don't go anywhere, and just stay here. No, I need to go. I've been too burdensome. You keep saying you're going to leave every time you open your mouth! Do you have somewhere to go? Don't you dare say the word "burden" one more time! If you do, I'll sell you off! Hey, guys! Hey, Jake! Oh, my sweet angel is in this house! This afternoon, she... Tammy and her boyfriend were here. They came to the hospital, too, don't worry about it. I've got it taken care of. Anyway, where are you going? Is my sweet angel staying with me? Do you get carsick? Where are we going right now? If you're sleepy, sleep. It's going to take a while. NowI realize,allIever want isonlyyou NowthatIsee the loveandlife NowthatItouchmyloveandlife NowI realize,allIever want isonlyyou Did she say that she won't re-organize the family tree? Lower your voice! Are you advertising it to everyone? There are many ears listening! Then listen to what I have to say. As a reason for divorce, there's nothing as good as an "affair". I know a lot of photographers who are good at taking R-rated pictures. I'll give you the number, so make them follow her immediately, starting tomorrow. But if you think about it, my relationship with him was an "affair". No, but you gave birth to a son. Ah, you're right! So, should I contact this number? Yes, her name is Jung Ji Sook. During the day she's normally at the Apgujeong gallery. You think so, right? Relationships with men? You and I understand each other very well. Yes, take photos like those (that prove an affair). Oh my! I'll call you back later. How long have you been there? Did you hear everything? I wasn't eavesdropping, I just happened to hear. I mean, if I was on the phone, you should have made your presence clearer. It was obvious that I was having a secret conversation! I was standing here with my notebook, writing this. If you're lucky, you won't get caught. But you should have used a disposable phone for a call like that. A disposable phone? Why are you telling me that now? ! Don't write! I told you don't write it! Don't even think about writing "But you never asked!" Are we here? I'll be back. How long will you take? I don't know either. I might be chased out after 5 minutes, or I could hold on for a little longer. If you're bored, just walk around. Just be careful of one person. Who? The person who looks the coldest here. Looks cold? So we can play another round for the Rangers Definitely win next time. Cheers. -Cheers. Excuse me, who is that? Excuse me (in Japanese), excuse me. Hyung. Follow me. Long time, no see, Hyung. Who did you get contacted by? Secretary Yoon? All this time, have you been well? So he did contact you? Did you think you could show your face at a place like this? How can I not come? If I come, I get to see you. Whatever you say, now that I've seen you- This is why children are hard to handle. How can you take action simply because you want to see someone? You don't even know the meaning behind your movement. It's been 3 years. I... grew quite tall. That's all, right? What you've been doing in America, I mean. Just do that much. Coming here was way too courageous of you. Leave. Are you alright? I'm not alright. Your clothes will get all wet. Why did you eavesdrop? If you were possibly in danger, I was going to count 1,2,3, take your hand, and run with you. Then why didn't you run? I was in danger the whole time you were watching. What? Just because... It's too quiet. Should we listen to the radio? What you saw earlier... just forget about it. Even if you hadn't said that, I would've. Everything's a dream anyways. A dream that will vanish when I wake up, a Midsummer Night's Dream. Are you alright? Yes. What was that? -A rockslide. It happens here every now and then. Is the car wrecked? Stay inside the car. Things are going to get difficult once the sun sets. What? What is this situation that seems like the first scene of a horror movie? How is it? The phone isn't working. You can't drive, right? What? Push harder, harder! Hurry. I'm pushing! Let's try it one more time. 1, 2, 3! What do we do? This isn't going to work, we should give up on the car for now. If you have any valuables, like a passport, bring it. It's all in here. But why? We have to look for somewhere with light before the sun falls. That way, we'll have a chance at contacting a repair shop or something. We can't just stay here? In movies, the characters find those places and end up dying there. Like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, Scream! You don't know 'Hello Sydney'? Then stay here. Let's go together! I'm going to die if I stay here by myself! So you've already concluded that you're going to die? If we're going have a season 2, at least one person will have to survive! I'm hungry. Do you even know where we're going? Is there another road here? It could be in the opposite direction. I saw a roadhouse on the way here. I bought this a while ago but forgot about it. Did you only buy one? No, two. One's for my mom. Do you want to keep spending money like water? Here. It's not because I want to eat, it's because... Whatever. You know that guy you contacted for help before? Did he reply? I haven't finished my question. Say it. What are you going to do if he contacts you? First, I have to get money. My sister took all my money so I don't have money for the plane ticket back to Korea. I can lend you money, too. What? With my kidneys as collateral? I don't have that much courage. You should take courage. You think I'm trustworthy? There is a reply. Really? When? Why didn't you tell me? Let me see your cellphone? Is there an internet signal here? How can the internet work when there's no service? Then, what should we do...? Oh! Look over there! We're closed for tonight, maybe tomorrow morning. Other places will be the same. If you decide to stay here tonight, I'll book the tow. Just a minute. What is this? There was a gift shop, so I got it. It's not like we can wear this to sleep. Is your aim to... get mistaken as a couple? Don't even dream about it. Go change and come out. Let's eat something. What a shame... I should've peeked at him. That looks good. Yea, thanks. This is the best they could do, since it's closing hours. This is better than nothing! Thanks, I'll eat well. They even have alcohol. You drink? ! Haven't you seen my hands shaking? You're a bit cute. It's good that you know. Stop looking; otherwise, I'm going to start asking you questions that make you uncomfortable. Uncomfortable questions... like what? "Who was the person you met at the farm?" A question like this? That's right. It's a person that I like the most in this world. Do you have more questions? Are you perhaps... Nothing, never mind. I don't mind if you think of me like that, but don't think about my brother. Oh, so it was your brother. Then, you like your own brother... - Hey! Are you dumb? What? You almost hurt yourself. It's because of you! I was just joking... Why is your face red? Thinking dirty thoughts... What red face? It's because I feel wronged! I didn't even get to eat a pancake after coming to America. Why pancake? If you watch movies, you see people pouring syrup onto their pancakes and drinking orange juice. It looks so American. At least, that's how I see it. So cheesy. There's a delicious pancake house on Melrose Avenue. When we go to L.A., let's go there together. Ah, seriously. Stop making promises like that! If you make promises, they break, and then you die! No, it's scarier if I keep paying attention to these things. Let's focus on this sausage. You're scarier. I'll sleep on the bed. Yes, of course. I'm just thankful you're getting me a place to sleep. Why are you so optimistic? It's because of me that you're in this uncomfortable situation. How is it your fault? It's because of the rock slide! Good night! Are you sleeping? Are you really asleep? Your acting sucks, so get up. I have something to ask you. If you don't wake up... What? What is it? Why do you want the Empire Group to go bankrupt? What? Did you read my SNS? How can I not? You logged in and everything! Why did you look? Log out when I say it nicely. I guess you really want them to go bankrupt. Why? It has nothing to do with you. Do you hold stocks in that company? Never mind. Keep a watch over me until I fall asleep. What? Because you kept talking about murders, I got scared. Sleep after I sleep. That's the room fee. Room fee? You just said that it was because of you that I was in this inconvenient situation! That was because of the rock slide. Ah, seriously... Just look, and don't think about doing anything to me. Hey! Seriously, you're not that great! As if... I take a while to fall asleep. That's why I was sleeping first... I have a lot of thoughts. I have a lot of sleep. If you get in contact with that guy, when are you going to Korea? Whenever possible, as quickly as I can. Just in case, if I... Loveisfeeling. ThemomentIfirstsawyou. Loveis feeling . Itfeelsas if thetimehasstopped. Togetherwithyou, Wewerein loveand desiredforeachother Loveismorepain. Themorewe love,loveisis morepain. Theworldenviesus. Apersonlikeyou ... Ittriesto hurtyou .

Thank you for contacting me. If your thankful, go quickly remove her. We're here. Can I see the phone for a minute, just in case my friend contacted me? Even if you get in contact, you'll need to meet up somewhere. Are you going to stand on the street? Cha Eun Sang! Chan Young! Yoon Chan Young! What happened? How are you here? So when you said you were going somewhere, it was America? ! How about you? Why didn't you reply? Did you not see the reply? I was worried. I'm sorry. I'll tell you about it later. I think I can breathe now. I can't believe this, Chan Young! Uh- - It's hot. If you have something to say, come in. Who is he? And what's that shirt? And where is this place? First, let's go in and say our greetings. Thank you for everything. I think I'll go to my friend's place now. Why? Huh? Just stay. You just need to borrow money. Why do you have to go? There's no more of a reason to stay here. Then how about this reason? Because of my friend, you had to go to the police. Because of the police that recognized me, even you were suspected and had your passport taken away. And because you didn't have your passport, you couldn't book a hotel, airplane, or anything. Really? Your staying in this house is not a burden, but something I should be doing for causing your inconvenient situation. So, you don't need to go. Is there a problem? What if there is? No, there isn't. Even if what you say is true, I'm still really thankful. I've found my passport as well. Are you perhaps... Kim Tan? Do you know me? - You know me, too. Who are you? Are you... somebody I bullied in middle school? It's not something you can classify so simply. Let's go. The taxi's here. Okay. Then, I'll be going. Bye. So, starting from that day, you stayed at his house? What else was I supposed to do? I didn't have any money or a passport. There was no one at my sister's place. But earlier, did you say his name was Kim Tan? -You didn't know? I didn't ask, because I didn't want to talk about myself. But is he a bad kid? Did he bully you? He's just somebody I know the name of. He's not very nice. Let's go in. So, what happened to your sister Eun Seok? I don't know where she ran off to. Bad girl. What am I supposed to say to my mom? Don't worry about your plane ticket. Thank you. When we get back to Korea- Just take your time. Thank you. When does the travel agency open? Do that slowly too. There's only one thing that needs to be done urgently now. Choosing the menu. Is there anything you want to eat? There is one thing I want to eat. Ddeokbokki. (Spicy rice cakes) Is it good? Yes, it's really good. That's really pretty! Hey, let's take a picture. Okay. 1, 2, 3. It's done! Are you putting it on your SNS? Yeah, to show you something cool. What? Count to three. 1, 2, 3. See that? Isn't it cute? Do you want to die? Do you want to see me get my hair pulled out by Lee Bo Na? Oh, that sounds fun! You're going to die! Wait a minute. Hello? Hey, are you crazy? Why is Cha Eun Sung there? What are you doing with Cha Eun Sung? I'm with Cha Eun Sang, thinking about you. What else would I be doing? It's the good times... Seriously... It's so annoying! It's tomorrow. This way please. [Tan] What? - Where are you? What if I told you? At this time, I thought you would be angry and pack your suitcase to go back to Korea. You're wrong. I've already arrived in Korea. Really? Then come back to America. Take back the luggage again. And change the flight for tomorrow. Tomorrow. I don't think he's going to see me the day after tomorrow. Yes, Madam. Wait. Mother. It's me. Is Tan there? Yes, we're together. He dressed up really nicely, just to see me. Then just listen. I'm going to say that you went to the States because Tan asked you to come, not because you were so anxious to see him. Why do you have to say that? I'm hanging up, your Mother-in-law is coming. You came? It was hard since I asked to meet at such an early hour, right? A busy person asks to meet me at this hour, I can't do anything about it. It was a bit hard though. It's because I was only available at this hour. How is it that, every time we meet up, I, who works in the fashion industry, feels ashamed. You gave birth to Tan at such a late age. How did you maintain such a body line? There are some things you are born with and some given with money and time. I heard Rachel went to the States. She crossed the ocean to see her fiancé, as soon as her school vacation started. Rachel is quite pretty. Today, the reason why I asked to meet up, I don't know if you've heard, but I am remarrying. I thought it would be proper to inform you first. I heard. The CEO of Zeus Hotel, Choi Dong Wook, right? Congratulations. Thank you. CEO Choi's son is also a student at our children's school. Yes, Young Do. Anyway, I have been wanting to ask you something. What happened between Tan and Young Do? According to Rachel, they aren't friends anymore.. Oh, just before Tan left for the States, they were close. Because you opened the door at a crucial moment, it's been ruined! Look how the light messed up the photo! Oh, what a shame. The next Bresson (famous photographer) could have been born! "For my lifetime, I tried desperately to capture the crucial moment." "However, every moment in life... was a crucial moment." What are you saying, you crazy jerk? It's something that your mentor, Henri Cartier-Bresson, once said. Don't you think you need to know who he is, before you are born as his successor? I'm going to kill you. Father Yes? It's not even the Hotel Manager... Couldn't you handle the Kitchen Manager? Why did you let words spread? Get up. Should I tell you why you never win? Firstly, because you've never beaten me. Maybe it's because I should have taken after you but I take after my mother. Secondly, you attack way more than necessary. Whether you're on or off the mat. Rachel's coming back, the day after tomorrow. Go greet her at the airport. Thanks, I'll wear it well. It something I really wanted. Try pretending like you actually mean it. How could you or I be moved by something that can be bought with money? The gift you gave me today is not the clothes, but your time. The time we spent shopping together. I know you don't like shopping. Thank you for coming anyway. Don't thank me. I like shopping with you. Because when we do something else, it will feel like we're on a real date. Did that woman leave? Yesterday afternoon. Did she leave, or did you send her? It worked according to your scenario. You told him the address, right? Could you stop talking about that girl? You were the one who brought it up. Hello? Choi Young Do? Are you an elementary school kid? You can't come by yourself? Whether you change your flight time or stay in America, make sure I don't have to go greet you at the airport. And don't let me call you because of this kind of thing again either. Crazy jerk. You heard, right? I'm about to be siblings with this bastard. I heard. Is Young Do doing okay? Of course, he's doing okay. He's doing what you used to do together, but all by himself. It's annoying. It's our engagement anniversary but Choi Young Do just ruined my mood. Let's go eat something sweet. How about the Melrose pancake house, the one you like? Watching American movies, eating pancakes with syrup and orange juice always comes up. Should I say it's like American style? Socheesy. There's a delicious pancake house on Melrose Avenue. Let's go when we go to L.A. Not there, let's go somewhere else. Why? If we go there, she could be there. Who? That girl? Yes. Is it something like destiny's instinct? Do you know how big L.A. is, compared to Seoul? But then, in this wide LA, you and her will be able to meet there? It's just a feeling. And, at this time if we don't book beforehand, there will be no seats. Let's go someplace else. Let's go, whether we see her or not. Since you say that, it makes me want to check if you're right. She really is there. Yoon Chan Young, becoming an American now, huh? When did you make reservations? It's just basics. How did you know this place? Did you search for L.A.'s places to dine? What? Well... of course. You guys didn't plan to meet beforehand right? Let's go somewhere else. Let's just eat here. I am trying my best to be considerate towards you. You are really annoying since a while ago. Why is not meeting with her an etiquette for me? Let's just go in. I want to eat here. There are no seats. Then we can just make one. Whether it is coincidence or destiny, I want to check. Did you make a reservation? I have someone waiting. So "White Hacker Yoon" was you. I'm going to take a seat. We will pay. Do you two know each other? From our school. As you can see, we're not that close. It's our first time talking to each other. I had not reason to talk with him, since he's at school on a scholarship for needy people. Get up. Today's our engagement anniversary. So, Kim Tan, you're allowed to eat pancakes if you want. Fine, let's eat. I, too, want to eat. What is your relationship with each other? We've been friends for a long time. Really? How did you know to come here? Since it's a famous place, that's why you brought her here? No, it's because my friend wanted to come here. Wow. What an incredible coincidence. But my fiance and this girl believe this is fateful. What do you think, Yoon Chan Young? I thought you wanted to eat pancakes. Stop. Since no one is talking... Ah! Then how about this topic? You dated Lee Bo Na, right? Say your greetings. This is Lee Bo Na's present boyfriend. And the ex-boyfriend. Should you even say things like that about a person who's not even here? Then why did you leave Lee Bo Na and be with this girl? It's your mistake in the first place. Wait, no. A man who has a fiancee and a man who has a girlfriend... Is it your biggest mistake that you meet only those men? Yoo Rachel! We will be leaving first. Let's go. What should I do? Should I meddle in? Or shall I pretend not to know? Order. We need to eat and buy my plane ticket. Stay for a few more days. You came all the way here anyway. I should go. I'm worried about my Mom, too. I should go back quickly, to start my part-time job in order to repay you. I told you, you can pay me back slowly. The way you look at me is prohibited. We're still in the States. Let go and talk. You were cool enough in front of that girl. Yoo Rachel. What? We first saw each other when we were 10 years old. I thought that you were a genius. A ten year old could speak on the phone in English, and you talked to yourself in Japanese. When you were 14, you liked my brother, right? To me, you said that I was a baby, so you didn't want to deal with me. What is it you want to say? When the mention of our engagement came up, you said this: "You know everyone in our social circle. Do you think there's a better match?" That time, I realized I was so immature. So? During those 8 years, Yoo Rachel, in my memory, has always been smart, pretty.. and mature. But then... you don't seem like much now. Don't be like that. All the more if it's because of me. There's no reason for you to ruin yourself while you put in an effort. I'm not worth that much. You said you would be going tomorrow, right? I will go to the hotel at that time. See you tomorrow. Kim Won Oppa? Yoo Rachel. Why are you here? You aren't staying in Young Do's hotel? Am I crazy to be indebted to that family? Looking at it, you came here avoiding it, too. Yeah. It's been a while since I've seen you. Are you doing well? Me... well. Did you meet Tan? No one feels sorry for them. People will knock on our door asking to lynch you. But I can make it easy for you if you collaborate. So... I'll tell you. Please. I didn't tell the whole truth but I didn't lie. This Beth exists, I just don't know if her name's really Beth. Do you want to know where the girl is? She's safe. No one will harm her. I'll tell you everything. Are you following me? - Me? - Yeah. No. Too bad. I mean, maybe... - Are you or aren't you? - I am. What for? Just to know your name. - Just my name? - Yeah. - Dahlia. - Dahlia? What a different name... Pretty name. Thank you. Thank you. I'm lying, it's Rosa. I knew it wasn't! Rosa? Mine's Bernardo. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Did you just want to know my name? For starters. And you... Where are you going? - Home. - Home? Where do you live? - Marechal. - Marechal? If you go to the next station with me, I can give you a ride. Don't look at me like that, my car's old but it's... A sports car, stylish... You'll like it. Does it smell of gasoline? My car? It does... It does? Well, I won't deny it, it's old, so it smells of gas... I go crazy on gas smell. Are you kidding me? You like the gas smell? I do... So... Perfect. I don't really understand cars or brands... I won't know which one it is. No need, you just have to like the gas smell. Are you in? OK, you're in. Let's go. I'll tell you everything. We'll keep each other company. Fine. Bernardo. Rosa. - Is this your apartment? - No. - No? - No. Why didn't you take me to your home? - Do you live with someone? - I do. - With whom? - With my mom. Aren't you a little old to live with your mom? My mom's very lonely... Lonely, old... She's sick. She needs someone to take care of her. I see... To our meeting. - Whose apartment is this? - A friend's. Is he coming soon? No, he practically lives in his girlfriend's house. We have it all to ourselves. Beautiful. Do we have all night? Practically. More or less. What do you mean, "more or less"? I need to get back home, I can't leave my mom alone. OK... Is this your uniform? Yeah... Did you like it? - What is this? - Curious girl... Do you work in this company? - Yeah... - Doing what? It says, right there. Are you a bus driver? I'm not a bus driver, I'm their boss. So important... I'm sorry! I knocked my glass, let's just put it here. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. You look hot in this shirt. I look a lot better without it. Oh, yeah? Let me see... - Hi. - Hi. - Do you work here? - I do. - Vanderley. - Wanderley. Wander... Wander... - Listen, do you know Bernardo? - Bernardo? Of course, Bernardo... - Can you get him for me? - I can't. - Why not? - He already left. I don't know his schedule... Usually it's really around this time, but today he had to leave. - His wife called, he had to... - What wife? Well, his wife. - Is he married? - Very married. No, I'm talking about a Bernardo from Sao Paulo... Yes, from Sao Paulo. Bernardo, from Sao Paulo. That's him. Same guy. My friend. Is he really married? Are you sure? He is... - What's your name? - Rosa. Rosa... You really are pretty! He told me about you. About you two... - Did he? - He did. You're his fling. And he didn't tell you he's married... Son of a bitch. Don't you tell him I told you. You didn't hear this from me. He's my friend. Keep it to yourself, OK? You did me a favor. It's cool. Bye, I have to go. - Why did you lie to me? - I lied to you? You said you lived with your sick mother... I know you have a wife and a small daughter. I didn't want to lose you, Rosa. I thought if I told you right away you'd leave. That's the only reason. I'm sorry. I didn't lie, I just... I wasn't going to tell you now. And when would you tell me? Huh? You'd fuck me until you had enough and then you'd tell me. Not a chance. I really like you. I really do... I don't think we met by accident. I really like you, I just didn't want to miss this opportunity, that's all. - And your wife? - What about my wife? Do you like your wife? I love my wife. I don't know what will happen from now on with us. But I really want you. I want to enjoy this, I want to be with you, I don't know our future, I don't know anything. Just let it happen. We can be together. It's nice. We'll have fun. I wouldn't lie to you. Really. I don't like lies. Neither do I. I don't mind being your lover. For now. After a while, I don't know what will happen. If I will still want it... - Yeah? - Yeah. But I want you to promise me one thing: Whatever you want. You won't lie to me again. I won't lie to you again, I promise. And you won't stop seeing me. Never. Little girl, I'll never stop seeing you. Really. I want you. - Don't worry about that... - No, no, no... - Let's use it. - I'm on the pill. - There are no chances, I swear. - I don't know... - Just come... - Don't... - It's better... - Don't do this... Don't do this to me... I wish I could get a two-month vacation. I'd get my car and drive up the coast until Recife. You know? Stopping every time... No stress, no headache... Just really enjoying it. Free, without any problems... - I really wanted that. - Go, then. But, hey: We wouldn't sleep in hotels, we wouldn't sleep in inns, we wouldn't sleep anywhere. Just here, like this. In the car. - Just like this? - Like a gypsy, like this. Fine... Looking at the stars, smelling the ocean... Together. You and me, close, next to each other... - Me? - Of course. Come with me. - I'm in. - Let's go? Delicious. - And your wife? - What about her? What excuse would you make up for her? I don't know. I don't. Sometimes I do that too, I make plans with you... I know I shouldn't, but... It happens. When I realize it, I'm thinking... Do you think that's bad? But you don't think I should fool myself... Let's go get some ice cream... Any flavor you want. - Sylvia? - Yes, that's me. - Sylvia... Clarinha! - Yeah... Wow, what a coincidence! - You don't remember me. - No. I'm sorry, you're... - Silvia. - Yes, I'm Sylvia. - No, I'm Silvia too. - Oh, sorry. - I'm Rita's friend, remember? - Rita's...? - Yes, Rita. - Rita... Little Rita? - Yes, Little Rita! - From high school? - High school, exactly. - Wow... Did you go there too? No, but we met one day, girl! It was you, me, Clarinha... She's so pretty, with that same face... But she was younger then... I'm sorry, help me... Where did we meet? Your husband was there, too. What was his name? - Bernardo. - Bernardo, exactly. I think it was at St. Penha's party. But, wow... What a coincidence I ran into you here. I'm so glad, I've been walking but I can't find... Could you give me a glass of water? Of course, no problem. Come, honey. Let's get her some water. - I'll be out in a second. - Can I ask for another favor? I mean, if it's not a bother... I kinda have to go... Can I use your bathroom? - Sure. - Really? Won't it be a bother? No, come in. You don't have visitors, do you? No, I was just home all day with my daughter. Thank you, such a relief... Don't worry. - Your house's so pretty... - Don't mind the mess. - Wow, such a great space... - Yeah, it's great. - You can't see it from outside. - You really can't... It's good. I'm just making some coffee. Don't you want to sit down? - Really? Won't I be a bother? - Don't worry, come on. - Have you seen Rita? - No. It's been a long time. - Me, too... A long time. - I miss her. Yeah... I don't even know what she's doing, where she lives. Do you know if she's still with that guy? - As far as I know... - As far as you know? What? Yes or no? God, what a question... Those two kept fighting, - breaking up, going back... - Yeah, right? - And... Do you live nearby? - No. - But I go to a dentist nearby. - Oh, really? - 2 streets from here. - A dentist, here? There is, yeah... And do you have to go back there often? Root canal, yeah... I have to. Yeah, it takes a long time... Well... If you're ever around and you need anything... - Thank you. - Don't worry. - Such a coincidence, huh? - Tell me about it. - Damn... - Rita's friend... Right? I think it's going to pour today. Do you think your wife is suspicious of us? I do. And does she accept it? In a way... She doesn't give it to me at home... Aren't you afraid she'll get a lover, too? Sylvia...? I doubt it. If I were you I'd be careful about that certainty. Enough chatter. Come. Enough talk, come. What is this? ! Stop, stop, stop... I even lost track of the game... - I lost... - Wait, I think I'm dizzy. - Really? - Really. Do you have low blood pressure? No, it's just... Sometimes, when I drink, I get sick. Wait, let me get you some water. Wow... Sylvia, I'm feeling sick, I think I'm going to vomit. Don't vomit in front of me, I'm terrified of vomit. - No, it's serious... - Here. Drink it. Thank you. - Best thing there is. - What? Water... Don't you want to take a shower? No, it's not necessary... Take a shower, you'll feel fresh, I'm sure. So? - Do you think? - Sure. I'll get you a towel. - Are you feeling better? - More or less. Yeah? Don't you want to lie down? - It's not necessary... - Lie down, it'll do you good. OK, but... What side do you sleep on? You can pick either one, it's not a problem. - That's the one I sleep. - Yeah? You know, even I feel a little queasy... Lie down for a bit. I think I still have time before picking Clarinha up. Slut. Dirty. Filthy! - Never dare see my wife again! - What are you talking about? - "What are you talking about?" - Stop, stop! What did you do? Don't act innocent. Why did you go there? - Why did you go there? ! - Let me go! Do you think this is a joke? Do you? - Should I let you go? - Let me go. Do you? Do you want me to? You don't. You don't want me to let you go. If I let you go, you'll never see my face again. Do that. Go! Get out of my life! Is that what you want? That's not! You want me inside you. Slut! - Take off your panties. - Stop. - Take off your fucking panties! - Stop! Take off your panties! Come on, quick! These fucking panties... Spread your legs. - Spread your fucking legs. - No, no... - Spread your legs! - No, stop... Stop! Then spread them. More. Let me see inside. Spread them. Now say it. Do you want another beating? Say what you want. - I want to leave. - Leave, my ass! You want me inside you! Come closer... Now repeat after me. "I want you to fuck me." - I want you to fuck me. - Louder! - I want you to fuck me. - Yes. Now ask. - "Please. Please." - Please. Yes... Now say it. "Please, I want you to fuck me." Please, I want you to fuck me. - "For the rest of my life." - For the rest of my life. Now all together. "I want you to fuck me for the rest of my life!" Please, I want you to fuck me for the rest of my life. You wish. Stop, stop... Promise me you'll never look for my wife? Promise me? Do you sell payphone cards? We have small, medium and large. Give me a large one. And a soda, too. - Can I talk to you a minute? - Fuck, girl, what is it? If it's those gospel conversion things, go find someone else. No, I'm not like that, don't worry. Amen, Jesus, good for you. I'm far from pure, go somewhere else, don't fuck with my patience. I just wanted to ask you for a favor. Fuck, I must be a lighting rod for crazies. What do you want? Could you make me a phone call? Are you trying to scam me, girl? Not you. It's fast. Here... I'll give you this. Hello? Darling... Are you gonna keep suggesting me? Hey, Bernardo... This is Beth here. No, you don't know me but I know your skanky wife, that bitch Sylvia, who's been hitting on my man, fucking and having an affair with him for a while now. Do you doubt it? Then leave and... Leave your job now and go to your house. See if she's not fucking my man in your bed, you cuckold. That's why you're a cuckold. If you don't fix her, I will. I'll break her teeth, she'll swallow them with her food. She's good with her ass but not with her food. Who the fuck is Rosa, boy? I'm not Rosa, my name's Beth. I told you... If being a cuckold's not enough, you're deaf. He hung up. - That's fine. - Should I call again? Tell me. I want to tell you something, but... I hope you don't get me wrong. Don't worry, tell me. I don't know if you've realized, but ever since we started hanging out... - I changed a bit. - You have a new haircut. Yeah, that too... That didn't change a lot, actually. I actually just want to thank you. - What for? - I don't know, I think... You gave me that push, you know? My relationship with Bernardo, it's at a place where we either stick together or we split, you know? - I do... - Yeah. But I'm also to blame, I wasn't very nice to him. I kinda lost my lust for him. - It's normal in long marriages. - I know it's normal, but... He started being distant because of that, you know? But recently our relationship started changing. I think it's because you showed up. - Me? - Yeah. You... Spending time together, you know... I don't know. He started realizing I'm not so irritating, I'm more open. And yesterday, when he got home, we had sex in a way, Silvia... Like we hadn't in years, you know? Like that... I think our love is much stronger now. It's closer, I don't know... I think you're... a bit responsible for all these changes. Crazy, huh? Do you think it's stupid? No... What are you doing here? Come here. Rosa, come here! - You're avoiding me. - Avoiding? I told you not to come to my street. Tell me what are you doing here? ! Get in. - Why are you here? - You're avoiding me. I'm not, I just didn't have time lately. That's all. Get in. Get in, Rosa, get in! Say it. You know you want to. You don't want us anymore and you're not brave to say it. I just need some time to think, Rosa. About what? You know what you want. How can you say that? Do you ever think about leaving your wife to be with me? - Do you? - No. Honey, your marriage is over, anyone can see that. - Give us a chance. - Are you crazy? Why insist on something without a future? That's exactly what I've been thinking. I'm the one that has no future for you? Is that it? - My period's late. - What? - Yeah. - What did you say? - It's late. - What do you mean, "It's late"? You're on the pill, you told me you were. I am, but sometimes I forget... - How can you forget? ! Rosa, how do you forget this, this is not a joke! It's not a joke, this can't be happening! You know what you'll do if it's true, right? - What? - Rosa, I have a family! I have a daughter, I have a fucking life! I can't keep putting kids in the world. - Do you want me to take it out? - It's the only way. I don't know if I want to. What...? You don't know if you want to? You don't even know if you're pregnant! You don't... Get out of the car. - Here? - Get out. Right here. Wait... Look for a drug store, take the test and only come back with the results. Go! Get out! Go! You're crazy, go! I'll pee my pants... - Hang on! - I can't, God... - Rosa... - In a second! Finally, Bernardo. I took the drug store test. It's positive. I wasn't about to joke with this, it's serious. I won't take it out, I'm having this child and you won't stop me. Don't worry, he won't know who the father is. You can have your family, your life, your wife... Maybe even I will forget who the father is. Don't come looking for me. I accept being without you but I want this child. I won't pick up your phone calls. I don't want to talk anymore, if you insist I'll move. Erase my number from your phone. Don't worry, leave it to me. Yes? Good afternoon, may I speak to Rosa? Just a minute, please. Rosa. Rosa. There's a man who wants to talk to you. Come on, honey, go! - Hi. - Hi. What do you want? I want to talk to you. Can we? OK, speak. - Come closer. - You can talk from there. Calm down, woman. It's just a talk, come. Let's talk. Properly. Come on... Just a little. There. Speak. Not with this gate... Come outside, come on. What do you want? I'm worried about you. It's true, I'm worried about you. I want to take you to a real doctor. These drug store tests are not reliable. - I know. - So, let's go to a doctor. I have a friend who's a doctor, he'll do the proper tests. So we know if you're pregnant or not. - I'm not taking it out. - I'm not saying that. Let's go with me. We'll do the exams first. We can't keep discussing over a hypothesis. We go, check it out... We don't even know if it's true. We'll talk afterwards. Let's go... - What, now? - Now. His schedule just opened. Let's take the tests and rest our minds... Come on. Put you to so much of trouble. You've taken all the money from the sponsor... and how will you get a dancer so quickly? "And for three months, I.... - Now look..." there's no need for you to worry. Damn Rahul! Why do you think? You're a good dancer? In this town there are many such dancers. "Sure, but you'll never get... - A dancer like you, right?" Right. - Now you don't worry about this. You have a nice rest and I'll come see you in the evening. I'll bring some food. We'll eat together. lt's a deal. Bye. - Bye. "l know. Chinese, right? - Right." Not to worry. lt will all work out. - How will it all work out? We've taken money from the sponsors and paid a deposit for the stadium. "And most of all, where will we get another dancer like Nisha?" "Come on, if we try, don't you think we can find one good dancer?" There are plenty of dance schools. One is close to our rehearsal hall. "We'll find a dancer there tomorrow. - Yes, yes!" "You're right. How about that, Rahul? Come on! Relax!" Whatever happens will be for the best. Let's go and have some cold beer. "You go ahead. I'm not in the mood. - Come on, buddy!" "Lay off, he's tired. Come on, let's go." Take care. - Let's go. Maya... I'll find her. "Water, water..." Excuse me... The sandwich man! Shanti... has a parcel come here by mistake? I haven't come for a parcel today. - Then tell me what I can do for you. I want to meet your daughter. - l don't have a daughter. No daughter? - No. "Then sir, this Miss Pooja Malhotra...?" Pooja is like my daughter. But how do you know her? I saw her last night. - Night...? Where? - ln the dancing school. She dances beautifully. - And so? "So, I wanted to meet her. - What for?" I want to ask her something. - What do you want to ask her? "Sort of, would she, with me... - With you... what?" If she wanted to work with me. - What work? I do plays. I'm looking for a dancer - You are doing a play. Yes. Are you a director? - Yes. I am sorry. I am sorry! Why didn't you tell me before? "l said so, when you asked me. - l am sorry. Come on." "Actually, I am a singer. - l see." I've done years of practice. Sit. "As it happens with many great artistes,..." you really don't meet many connoisseurs. You've met me today. You don't know how lucky you are! "l know, sir, but I have come to meet Pooja." "Now that you have met me, you will meet Pooja, too!" "l won't give you more than 75 bucks. - 80 bucks, no less." Only last week I bought it at that price. This is the right price. Taste it and see how sweet it is. I will give you only seventy-five. "Show me the watermelon. - Here you are, sir." "Seventy-five is the right price. How many do you want, Madam?" Just one. - Pack this for Madam. But... - Oh come on! It's your first sale in the day. And you're haggling for 5 bucks! Be a sport! Hi. - Hi. Recognise me? We met last night at your dancing school. Remember? "Oh yes. - l'm, Rahul" You must've heard of me? - No. "Well, never mind. Actually you are a pretty good dancer." "Actually, I'm doing some music shows and I need a special dancer..." for a special role. When I saw you dancing yesterday... I thought that you would be ideal for this. So what do you think? Would you be interested? "No, thanks. - l've had it!" "Sir, watermelon! - Dammit! My career's at stake!" "Excuse me, but perhaps you misunderstand me." I'm talking to you about no ordinary show. It's a very high-class show with a very high-class audience... and I am sure you will also enjoy doing it. Why don't you try it once? "Not for me, for the sake of art." Dancing is my hobby. - That's really good. But I am afraid of dancing on stage in front of an audience. Why are you afraid? - l don't think I can do it. I'm sorry. - No... problem. Excuse me... I'm sorry. "You see, I'm really in difficulty. Actually, my lead dancer..." has fractured her foot. I've already taken all the money for the show. "lf we don't perform, I'll suffer monetarily, I'll also lose face." "Come just once for a rehearsal, and if you don't like it, it's fine." "But please, just once. Please come to the rehearsal." I'm really very sorry. I can't do it. "You'll have to take someone else. - l beg of you, please!" What are you up to? ! - You don't know me. I'm stubborn. I'll not go until you agree. Please come just once to a rehearsal. "Everyone's looking at us. - Please... please come, just once!" I'll come. - Promise? Promise. - When? What time ? Two O'clock. - Can you come at one ? "Okay, I'll come at one. - Thank you very much!" "You know that we are neighbors, don't you?" I know. - Thank you very much! "Ma'am! You'll come, won't you Ma'am?" "Yes, you will!" Yes? For you. He's mad! "Rahul, you said that girl would come at one o'clock..." It's four now. I don't think she'll come. "So what should I do? So if she doesn't come, won't we do our play?" I was only... - Go and get on with your own thing. "Okay, relax." "Ballu, put the spotlight on the entrance." Hi. - Hi. You must've heard of me? "Cut it! No, no!" "No Pooja, no! You are not dancing with abandon." You are concentrating more on the steps and music. I don't want to see how well you dance. I have already seen that and you are very good. I want to see whether you are Maya or not. I want to see the extent of Maya's love and abandonment. I want to see what happens when Maya dances wholeheartedly. Right? We'll try it once more. "All right, music!" Cut it! Why don't you understand what I'm trying to tell you? Forget that anyone's sitting here. Forget that the music is playing. Forget that this is a rehearsal. Just think of Maya. I don't want to see you dance. I want to see your madness! Maya's madness... "l'm sorry, Pooja. - Don't touch me." "l'm really sorry, Pooja. I was just..." Never in my life has anyone spoken to me in such a way. "l know, Pooja... but I'm an idiot. I don't know how to talk to girls." "l told you, I can't do it." But you're doing it really well. I am going on about this Maya. I don't understand this Maya. - Never mind... I don't want to do this. - Don't worry if you don't understand. We don't have to do this today. We can do it tomorrow. Okay? I don't want to do it tomorrow either. - Okay. "Maya, relax. - My name is Pooja!" "Of course, it's Pooja." "l'm sorry... sit down, please." "l'm really sorry... Pooja, if you don't want to dance, then don't." But please stop crying. Don't want water? No problem. "You see Pooja, it's my way to yell during rehearsals." I wasn't having a go at you. I was only trying to explain to you about Maya. "Pooja, perhaps you didn't understand Maya." Maya is the kind of girl who lives in a dream world. She believes that one day her dream prince will come and carry her away. Her friends have always made fun of her... but that did not shake her belief. "And today, she has met the man of her dreams..." and she is dancing. There is intense love in her dance and madness and a certain arrogance. "As if to say, "l knew he would come and now, see, he has come" "My dream man has come" Music! Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant "Nisha, I can't believe we got such a good girl so quickly." "Had I not got the right girl for this role, I'd have cancelled the play..." "given back the money, and willingly faced the music." But I was destined to meet Pooja. "Her name is Pooja? - No, it's Jeetendra." Of course it's Pooja. is she beautiful? - Really beautiful. Remember how I used to describe Maya? She's just like her. "That innocent face, those dreamy eyes and that bashfulness." "She is too good, Nisha, she is brilliant!" is she a good dancer? - When she dances... you can only keep looking at her. I know that... you will go crazy when you see her. - l see. But can she act? "What? Of course, she can. lf she can't act, what am I for?" If I can get you to act I can get anyone to act. Very funny. "There's no water, no soft drink... and you've called me for dinner." Wait a minute and I'll bring some. is she as good a dancer as me? Are you crazy? There's no dancer as good as you. Right. Right. Idiot. Can't even lie properly. Torn! The stitch... "May I say something, Pooja? - What?" "When you laugh, you know... - l know that I look good." When you laugh it starts to rain. "With the gait of a horse, with the majesty of an elephant" "O King of the Rains, where are you from?" "l know a girl, when she smiles,... it rains" "l know a boy, when he sings, it rains" "The clouds have descended..." "They have blocked our path" "Tell us what your intentions are..." "will you not let us go home?" "There's rain ahead, a storm behind" "The weather is treacherous... Oh, where can we go?" "The sky has lowered..." "Everything has come to a standstill" "How lovely is this season of shadows" "Take it as the sign of the times" "ln such a weather, say something..." "...do something! Why do you stand silent?" The doctor has said clearly that you can't go out of the house. There's no need for you to strain yourself trying to get up. Now settle down quietly. Whom are you phoning the minute you've got here? "Oh yes, he called to say that he's at Soni's house." "At Soni's? Oh yes, today's Soni and Jimmy's engagement." "Aunty, get my clothes out quickly. I want to go there." "Look, I'll phone the doctor. - Aunt, please!" She just won't listen! I hate these weddings. I don't understand why people get married. If two people have decided to spend their whole lives together... why are the others making such a fuss? Why are all they getting excited? These days it has become fashionable to have seven days of ceremonies... "and merriment at weddings. Forget it, buddy." "Get married, have a quiet ceremony and then go home and sleep." I've even come to hate the word 'marriage'. "Excuse me, may I have another?" But the one good thing is that in all this fuss... you get lots of goodies to eat. Have you eaten? Later. - Let's sit. I really love weddings. "The different small ceremonies, dancing, singing, and making merry..." they're what I love. - Very good. I'm going to have all of them at my wedding. Are you getting married? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? When are you going to do it? "Actually, nothing's fixed yet. He works abroad." When he comes back then... we'll fix a date when we've found an auspicious time. That's why I haven't mentioned this to anyone. I see. Congratulations. Thanks. "Rahul, when's your wedding with Nisha?" Nisha and me? Have you gone mad? The two of us are just good friends and there's no chance of us... "ever getting married and in any case marriage and me, no thank you." "Actually, I don't believe at all in these wedding ceremonies." I don't know how a person decides to spend his whole life with another. I fail to understand and I'm certain... There can't be a girl who could spend her whole life with me! You're mistaken in your thinking. There is such a girl. Where is she? - Somewhere or the other. Rubbish! "l believe that in the beginning, God made all the relationships." But then HE left it to us to find each other. HE created us all as couples. For every one of there is a soulmate. You just have to wait till you meet her. Do you think this is true? This is the truest thing in my life. True! That means that you have met your soulmate. Yes. I have met him. Something's amiss. - What? The ice cream's good. Have some. - No. Nisha! When were you discharged from the hospital? I ran away from hospital. - Great! Jimmy and Soni... will be delighted to see you. - Where are they? "Over there, go and meet them. - Rahul is there, isn't he?" Rahul's gone to drop Pooja home. Thanks. See you tomorrow. It's that story you told me at Soni's. "That some special girl is made for me... etc, etc..." I've been thinking about that. I didn't understand something. - What? How will I know who's made for me? You have such faith in this theory that you must know... how I am going to meet this girl also. "l mean, will she be wandering about with a board with my name on it?" "Or, when I see her will there be a clap of thunder and a bolt of lightning?" Or will music start to play? What will happen ? "HE will tell you, HE will give a sign..." and your heart will realise who the girl is. I've even reasoned with her... but she doesn't listen. She does what she wants. - Hi doctor. "Rahul, it's good that you came. This girl has worried me." Why? What happened? - l told her clearly that... "she needs to stay at home to rest. But you see, she's packing her bags..." and getting ready to go somewhere. - Where to? How would I know? I've tried my best to explain. She doesn't listen to me. "Well, only you can convince her." "Don't worry, she won't go anywhere. I'll just go and twist her ear." Best of luck. See you. - Bye "What are you doing, Nisha? Have you gone mad?" "The doctor told you to rest, right? By the way, where are you off to?" I'm going to London. - London? "Well, Mum and Dad keep phoning me asking me to go to see them." Months have gone by. "l think I'll go to see them. Besides, I want to run away from here." Want to run away...? From whom? "From myself. - What's all this nonsense, Nisha?" "l've begun to get scared of myself, Rahul." "l want to go, to avoid committing mistakes, like I did one yesterday." "Nisha, you haven't done anything of the sort." You only danced. Look here... - Rahul... now we should stop playing hide and seek with each other. We both know what the problem is. What's the problem? The problem is that I love you and you don't love me. "Look here, Nisha... - l know..." that you know how much I love you. That night I wasn't so out of it... that I couldn't hear what my heart was saying. "Actually, Rahul, we have become such good friends..." that we take each other for granted. So I think that a bit of space will give us time to think. "But I am sure that when I'm not here, you'll remember me often." Then perhaps you will start caring for me. "One thing is certain, that an idiot like you..." doesn't deserve a girl like me. "And I don't why, but I feel that when I come back,..." you will be on your knees begging me to get married to you. And who knows at that point... I may not want to marry you. "Well, perhaps you haven't seen your face..." It's better than yours. Nisha... you're really nice. "l know. Come on now, I got say bye to everyone before going to the airport." "Come on, Rahul, hurry up." We haven't been properly introduced. Let's start from the beginning. Hi! I'm Nisha. I'm Pooja. "Now that we are friends, will you forgive me for what I did yesterday?" Forgive you? For what? "Pooja, what I did with you yesterday, wasn't right." "Actually, ever since this place was built,..." I'm the only one who's danced on this floor. This floor has become my trademark. So when I heard that someone else was dancing in my place... I felt bad. "Without seeing you or knowing you, I felt jealous." I shouldn't have felt that way. "Had I been in your place, then perhaps I'd have done the same." "Moreover, I really enjoyed dancing with you." You were the one dancing. I was doing something else. I am really sorry. - lt's okay "Come on, Nisha, it's time for your flight." I always told Rahul that there could never be another dancer like me. But I can't say that anymore. And I'm sure that no one can perform the role of Maya better than you. "Not even me. All the best, bye. See you." Bye. Hi. I'm Rahul. Perhaps you've heard of me? I'm looking for a special dancer for a special role. I saw you dance yesterday and felt you would be ideal for this. "Check, check... 69..." "Ballu, what are you doing? Angle the spotlight properly." "Pooja, good, good. But..." I think that you aren't dancing freely. I want to see how Maya looks when she's happy. I want to see the extent of Maya's madness and love. Okay? Do it again. Okay! Quiet everybody. Take it from the top! Music! Cut it! Cut it! "Haven't I told you to forget that you are you, to forget that.." people are sitting here. Forget that there's a rehearsal going on here. Pack up! "One thing I don't understand, Pooja." "How I will know which girl was made for me? I mean,..." will she be wandering about with a board with my name on it? "When I see her, will there be a clap of thunder and a flash of lightning?" "Oh dear, what's happening? I don't really know" "l only hope this does not turn into a romance" "Oh dear, what's happening? Nobody really knows" "But if this is a romance, then so be it" "Take my hand in yours, as long as you are here" "Let us keep talking, as long as we can" "Let's sit here looking at each other,..." "as long as the night remains." "What name can I give this season of my heart" "Even the dewdrops seem to burn, with the fever of my heart" "Why do I feel as if someone has caressed me" "Please go away for a while, so I can collect my feelings" "And quieten the violent beating of my heart" "Let's slow down so that we don't move ahead too fast" "There is something between us, don't deny it" "And if something further happens have faith in your feelings" "For you should know, your heart is not what it was" "Oh dear, what's happening? - l don't really know" "l only hope this does not... - turn into a romance" "Oh dear, what's happening? - Nobody really knows" "But if this is a romance... - then so be it" I hope your uncle will be asleep so I won't have to hear him sing. Bye. - Bye "Rahul, I forgot to tell you... - What?" I can't attend rehearsal tomorrow. - Why? Tomorrow I'm going to Khandala. - Khandala? Why ? My teacher lives there. - Which teacher? My dance teacher. She taught me everything I know. Tomorrow it's her birthday. "lf l say no, will you not go?" "l shall go, but if you say yes, I'll go happily." I'm joking. Go on. I'll rehearse with someone else tomorrow. Thanks. Bye. - Bye. I've had it. Rahul...? What are you doing here? I have a friend in Khandala. He's been inviting me for ages... but I've never had a chance to go. And since we can't work without you... I thought I'll meet him and give you a ride too. You've no one with you so I thought it'll be company for you. What are you staring at? Hurry up! If we go early we'll beat the traffic. "Well, why are you smiling ? - No reason." Let's go. - Today I'm really missing my friend. "Tommy, quiet! Quiet!" They won't do anything. I'll be right back. Stay here. "Don't worry, they won't bite you. I'll be back." Want some soft drink? "Sandhya, what are you doing? I'll give you a good slap." "Glutton, you have become so fat, you can hardly move." No chocolates or ice creams for you. Get it right this time. Move the neck. Arms straight. Why are you laughing? Close your mouth. If anyone gets it wrong then no one will watch TV tonight. "Don't come begging me again, Please Tai ! Please Tai !" Look! Here comes your dear Pooja! "Tai, how did you recognise me? - There's no need to act smart." I recognise all the girls from the sound of their steps. Happy Birthday to you! What's this? You've brought me another ugly sari. "Yes, I chose the ugliest I could get my hands on." Where you are going? The class isn't over yet. Now I'm here... the class is over. - You're spoiling them rotten. They behave well all through the year. And the day you come... they start misbehaving. - Sometimes one should be spoilt. Tai! Wait! Rahul is my friend. - Your friend? "Leave him, children. - Go on, children... go inside!" Why are you so frightened? Happy Birthday! What are you up to? ! - l'm trying to touch your feet. "Do I look that old? - No, but out of respect.." Give me your hand... - Pardon me? Your hand. Nice to meet you! "Come on, you've caught a cold. Come, let's go in." Save me from the dogs. - They won't hurt you. "Tai, who's he?" I don't know but I will have to find out. "Pooja, you didn't tell me what Rahul does." Rahul...he directs plays. Nowadays I'm working with him. I see. I think that you don't like Rahul specially. "No, I like him very much." Very much? "l mean, he's a good friend." Good friend? You mean you don't love him. "Tai, Rahul's just a friend. A dear friend." I see... a dear friend. It's not like you think and in any case I wanted to tell you something. There's no need to tell me. I understand everything. "Stop it, Tai. Tai, you've got it wrong." "Rahul, what's up?" Nothing. Why are you standing with the spoon? Come join us. Stupid! - Hey everybody! "Come on everyone, follow me... this way." "lf it's not love, then what is it?" "Tai,... honestly! - Look here, girl!" I've known you since you were twelve years old. "What your heart doesn't let you know, it tells me." The look in your eyes says that you love this boy very much. Now stop lying to me... okay? "Just a dear friend"... big deal! - Listen, Tai..." "l don't remember when this happened" "lt's become hard to hide this secret from everyone" "lf you say so, today I'll ask God for something" "Oh dear, what's happening to you? - Beats me" "l just hope this doesn't turn... - into a romance" "l see, so when is Ajay coming back?" Nothing is definite but he could come at any time. I'll be right back. "Pooja, give me your hand. - Why?" I won't hit you! Give me your hand. What's this? Listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you. Ever since you were a child... you have always considered others before yourself. I have always been overwhelmed by your behavior. But today you have made me sad. But I... - Quiet! Sometimes it's very important to consider ourselves. I see that you are running away from your dreams. You won't let them come true. Don't do this. Not everybody is fortunate to have their dreams come true. Don't do this. "Tell you something, one happens to fall in love many times." True love only happens once. You are failing to take the right step. Lord Ganpati will help you to do what is right. HE will give you the strength to fulfill your dreams. "Keep lt with you, always. I have faith in lt." "The Lord will set everything right. - l love you, Tai." Stop it! I don't make a habit of crying. Why are you frightened? - Pardon me? Why are you frightened of being in love? Tell her. "Love and me? I was just... - Okay, give me your hand." Nice to meet you. - Take it! "What's this? - This is, in a way, my blessing." I'm very mean in this matter. I don't give my blessing that easily. But when I saw you I thought that perhaps you need it. This will help you to say what you are unable to say... Keep it very carefully. You get it? - Got. "She is coming. lf you can't say it, then I'll say it..." I'll say it. Definitely? - Definitely. Mark my words carefully. Bye! - Bye "Bye! - Goodbye, sister!" "Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen... May I have your attention, please?" "Aunty, please... thank you." Since I am Jimmy's best man... I have the right to make a speech... and you all have to listen to it. "Until today, I didn't understand how two people can take a vow..." to spend their entire lives with each other. I didn't believe in these vows of marriage. And seeing Jimmy and Soni together only strengthened my conviction. Because there can't be anyone as innocent as Soni... and there can't be a scamp to beat Jimmy. I used to worry that Soni and Jimmy are too different... to spend their lives together. But today I realise that I was wrong. I am a little ashamed to admit that I have started believing in love. "The kind of love in which lips don't speak, eyes do." The kind of love that binds two people together forever. "And today, I keep thinking of just one thing." I remember something a very dear friend said:... that God predetermined all our emotional relationships... but then HE left it to us to find each other. HE made us all couples and for every one of us somewhere... there is just one soulmate. HE made Soni for Jimmy. Today I thank God for getting Jimmy and Soni together... and I pray that HE may give each one of us the ability... to recognise our own soulmate. Thanks. "Rahul, you are strange." Soni and Jimmy have made their farewells and you're still here. "l don't like farewells. - Okay, but drop me home, will you?" My bangle? "Rahul, have you seen my bangle?" Damn! Now I am sure I won't find it. It was my favorite bangle. "Mine, too." Rahul ! "Come on, give it to me." Come here and take it. What childish behavior! Give it to me! Come closer. Here goes... happy? Come closer. "Closer... - Rahul, stop it!" Closer... Closer... Closer still... Closer... "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something" "You say something, I'll say something, my love" "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something" "You say something, I'll say something, my love" "We would rather have died than reveal our secret, oh my love" "You were a few steps away from me, I was a few steps away from you" "Yet we may as well have been hundreds of miles apart" "Step by step our wavering hearts came together, my love" "Come, you have won me over and I am defeated by my heart" "Today with great difficulty my lips say 'love"' "Now I'm madly in love..." "don't ever leave me, my love" "How long shall we sit in silence? We both want to say something" "You say something, I'll say something, my love" The set is ready. "Good, well done. Call Pooja." Okay. Shruti Call Pooja. "Pooja, we're ready." Are you angry with me? - Not at all. Then why aren't you speaking to me? - l am speaking to you. For three days I haven't seen your face or heard your voice. I was very busy. I have been calling you everyday. Why haven't you been answering ? The phone has been out of order for some time. What is the problem? Tell me. I want to know the cause of your restlessness. There's no problem. - There is a problem. Serious problem. The fact is that we both love each other very much. We can't tell each other about it. Today I've come here to tell you... that I love you. I love you very much. And I know that you also love me. "So then, say it once and that will be the end of your restlessness." Everything will be all right. I don't love you. - You're lying. I'm not lying. - You aren't? Look into my eyes and tell me that we weren't made for each other. We weren't. "Tell me that when I go away from you, that you don't turn to look at me." I don't. "Tell me, when I touch you nothing happens to you." Nothing. - Tell me... that you don't want to come into my arms right now. I don't. Look into my eyes just once and tell me that you don't love me. I don't... I don't... I don't! Terrific performance! Very well done! Nisha! Hi. - Great to see you back again. But I am sure that when I'm not here you'll remember me often... "and when I get back, you will be on your knees begging me..." to marry you. And then perhaps I may not want to. "Well, I'll be off." I'm a little tired. I'll see you all tomorrow. What's up with Nisha? - She's tired. She'll come tomorrow. Don't get unnecessarily worried. "l'm not a nice girl, Rahul." I'm bad. I'm really bad. "No Nisha, you are my friend." And no friend of mine is bad. "No, Rahul, you don't know that I am not a nice girl." "Now you see, I love a boy and have always loved him..." and today I realised that he doesn't love me. He loves someone else. "l feel bad, I'm hurt..." I'm upset. I feel jealous. "Rahul, I shouldn't feel like this. I am bad." "l am very bad. No, Nisha..." "No, Rahul." "Actually, that boy isn't just the one I love..." but he's also my best friend. "Today, for the first time, I saw love in his eyes." "l couldn't put love there in all these years,..." but that other girl has. Perhaps they are made for each other. Perhaps I was never meant for him. Perhaps her love for him is true. "So you see, I should be happy for my friend." I should revel in his happiness. But I'm not happy... I'm not! I'm very bad... really very bad. "Nisha, you are not bad, you are really nice." You know who is bad? HE is bad... THE ONE who plays around with us humans... "making A love B, while B loves C..." and C loves D.... I don't know why HE does this. When HE makes one person love another... then HE ought to make sure that the other one also loves her in return. Right? But that's not what HE does. HE's really bad. You're not bad. HE's bad. You're right... It's HE who's bad. HE's bad! YOU are bad. I am not. YOU are bad. I haven't done anything wrong. YOU are the one. YOU are bad. YOU are bad. "l'm sorry, Nisha." "Don't say sorry, Rahul. Else, I'll cry." "l'm sorry, Nisha." "Don't say sorry, I'll cry." Ajay... "when I was a little girl, you used to tease me about my dreams." When I used to tell you that I am looking for the one meant for me... you would say that I am mad and silly. You would smile and say that when I grow up... my dreams will vanish. "But you know, I have grown up and my dreams have not vanished." They have grown with me. "That day, at the airport, when you suddenly asked me to marry you..." at first I didn't realise what I should do. "But then I thought, I was crazy..." "you were my dearest friend, and the one who knew me the most." Who could be better for me. And I remained standing there. You left and I made you a part of my dreams. I started believing that you were the one made for me. And then... and then I met Rahul. Ajay! You're marrying Pooja? ! What are you saying? But Pooja hasn't said anything to me about it. I had forbidden her from telling you. I wanted to tell you myself. I can hardly believe you! I am so happy! When are you coming ? I called just to tell you this. I'm coming tomorrow. Tomorrow...? What can I tell you about Rahul? Where do I start? "Well, you should realise that I've never met anyone like him." "Sometimes he's an angel, sometimes a devil." Sometimes crazy... and sometimes a genius. Sometimes he scolds so harshly... and sometimes he makes funny faces to make me laugh. At times he's more stubborn than a kid and at times he's a beloved companion.. "ln three days? Oh no, I want time to get things ready for a big wedding." "Ma, I don't have time. The company is sending me to Japan for a year." You'll have to wait for eight to ten months. I can't wait that long. "All right, you come here and I'll start the preparations." "The dreams of your crazy girl have come true, Ajay." She has found the partner of her dreams... and she wants your permission to make all her dreams come true. Can she make her dreams come true? Ajay phoned just now. He's told me everything. "He's coming tomorrow, Pooja..." ...and he says to get the wedding organised as quickly as possible. You would tell me your smallest secrets... and you hid such a big one from me ? Come here... sit by my side. "You know, Pooja, ever since you came to this house,..." "l've had a dream in which, one day, you would become my daughter-in-law" And I your mother. "But I was apprehensive, I didn't know how the two of you..." would feel about each other when you grew up. Whether you would be friends and care about each other or not. "l also wanted that you should decide if at all because you wanted it,..." not for my sake. I wanted you to choose Ajay out of your own free will. "You don't know how happy I am, for l know..." that there cannot be better girl than you for my son. Just watch. I'm going to give you a grand wedding. You have no idea how happy I am. May you live long. I want full lights and I want to see M6 on both left and right of stage. "Supandi, in a while I want to hear the music tracks." "Soni, the elevation should be three feet higher..." or else the audience on stage right will not know what is going on. "When Ballu lights M6, one spot light will filter here on this side..." and the audience will get a glimpse of the entry before it happens. Hi Pooja. I need to talk to you. "The show opens in two days, we'll talk later." Show me all the costumes of act three. Go do some work. "l have to talk to you. - Pooja, just a minute." Okay... tell me what's the problem? "Rahul, please try and understand what I am about to tell you." "Rahul, Nisha is calling you. The stadium has called." I forgot to talk to her. I'll be right back. Where's Nisha? Rahul please be serious... Ajay...? "My name is Ajay, but if you like you can call me Rahul." Fatty! I love you! I really missed you. "Remember, I told you that I'd come to get you ?" Here I am. I came here after meeting mom. "She is so happy. Hey, I hope you haven't changed your mind?" "You're marrying me, aren't you?" Have you told your friends? - l was going to... "Hear that! I'll have to do that, too?" I'll tell them. Ladies and gentlemen... I'm sorry for the intrusion. You don't know my name: it's Ajay. I am Pooja's childhood friend. And since she hasn't found a worthy guy... I took pity on her and I am going to marry her. Congratulations! - Thank you very much. "ln three days we are getting married and you all must come, with family." "Pooja, you're weird. Why didn't you tell us before?" We had begun to feel that you were our Maya. We forgot you're Pooja and you have your own private life and your own relationships and even prior commitments. We are really stupid! "Oh I forgot... Pooja, congratulations." Thanks. - And this is... "This is Rahul, our director." "Rahul, she likes your name a lot. - She likes only the name...?" "l hope so, man! - Congratulations." "Thank you. Rahul, I have a request. - Go on." May I take her away for an hour? - Oh come on! You are taking her away forever from us. "That will be in a ceremonious way. Say what, Pooja?" This is just a lunch date with Pooja. Do I have your permission...? My permission! Now I'll have to get your permission to meet Pooja. "Besides, now that you've come, Pooja won't be happy here, will you Pooja?" So go on. I'll get by without you. "Are you sure? - Yes, of course! Absolutely!" You guys go and have a good time. Go on. We have his permission... let's go. - Go on. "Okay guys. Bye. After three days, okay?" "Ballu, show me the final mix." "Shruti, show me the sketches." "And Nisha, call up the auditorium and tell them the sketches..." will be with them by the evening. In two days we are going on stage... Lights! why aren't you showing me the lights. There are just two days... and you're taking it easy! "Come on, the lights." "Shruti, show me the sketches, Shruti, here, fast!" Hurry up! We got to finish the music rehearsals too! This is our last meeting. I'm getting married tomorrow. I don't want to meet you ever again after today. Just think that I was never a part of your life. "As soon as I start to move, track me with the spotlight..." and the other will stay on Pooja. "When I get right up to the audience, then slowly dim the light." The show will be over... The End. "That's it. Any questions? I don't want any mistakes, okay?" "Rajesh, everything all right? - Yeah." "Okay then, tomorrow be at the stadium on time." Pack up. Something is bothering me. - What? I don't like the end of your story. - Why? This ending's too sad. A love story should always have a happy ending. "The audience should come out smiling, right?" People like to live in a dream world. "They have seen many dreams, now let them see a little reality." Every love story is like this in real life. Full of sorrow and pain. "No, Nisha, this ending is absolutely right." There can't be another end to this love story. "l know a girl, when she smiles,..." "it rains" "l know a boy, when he sings..." "it rains" "Jimmy, just go and check the next entry stage left." "The heart is crazy, just refuses to listen." "Oh dear, what's happening? I don't really know" "l only hope this does not turn into a romance" "Oh dear, what's happening? Nobody really knows" "But if this is a romance, then so be it" Pooja's last entry is after this. Get her ready and bring her here. Don't worry. Nisha's getting her. Thanks. "Don't make this mistake, Pooja." Very few people are lucky enough to love and to be loved. "You can't break the tie, which HE has ordained." You can't break it. "l've spent my years giving love the name of friendship,..." now you are going to spend the rest of your life... giving friendship the name of love. This is a betrayal! A betrayal of love... a betrayal of friendship. Don't do such a thing! This is our last meeting. I'm getting married tomorrow. I don't want to meet you ever again after today. Just think that I was never a part of your life. I want to ask you something before you go. Did you ever love me... even for a single day or a single moment? This line is not in the play. - Raju! Tell me just once... have you ever really loved me? Even for a moment? What the hell is Rahul saying? ! I shan't go away until I get an answer to my question. I'm not going! "Did you ever love me, even for a single moment?" No. - What did you say? I didn't hear that. - No. "Speak up, I couldn't hear." "No. - Louder, louder.." "No, I have never loved you." "Not for a day, not for a moment. Never." That is all I wanted to hear. "l'm Rahul,... you will remember my name, won't you?" What can I tell you about Rahul. Where do I start from? I have never met anyone like him. "Sometimes he's an angel, sometimes, a devil." "Sometimes he's crazy, sometimes he is a genius." Sometimes he scolds very harshly and sometimes he makes faces... and makes me laugh. Sometimes he is more stubborn than a child is... and sometimes he is a beloved companion. "What he is or is not, I cannot really express in words..." but I don't know why... "When he looks at me, I feel beautiful,..." when he laughs I feel like dancing. When he is upset I feel like holding him in my arms. When he loves me my eyes fill with tears. He has made me realise that I am made for him... and he for me. "l love him very much, not for one day or one moment..." but for my whole life. "l love you, Rahul. I love you." "Now that I've seen them, I believe that someone, somewhere..." was made for me as well. Isn't that true? - Yes. My name is Ajay. Yours? I'm Nisha. Are you married? - What...? What is love? Love? Love is life. Love? What is love? Why and where? I believe that God predetermined all our emotional relationships. But He left it to us to find each other. He made us all couples.. ..and each one has a soul mate. A soul mate? What nonsense! I don't believe in all this.. I'm absolutely sure. Somewhere, someone has been made for me.. ..and that someday, I shall certainly meet him. Okay, but will someone please tell me.. ..how would I know who was made for me? I mean, will she be holding a placard with my name on it? When I see her, will there be a clap of thunder.. ..or a flash of lightning? What? How would I recognize her? I don't know what others would do, but I'll certainly know it's him. He will tell me.. He will give me a sign, and my heart would know its him. What is all this? - This is love. Love? "However far apart they may be.." "Their paths will meet, come what may." "When two people are made for each other." "Made for each other." "Like the heart and heartbeats.. - Made for each other." "Like the eye and the mirror.. - Made for each other." "Like the monsoon and the rains.. - Made for each other." "There's a man for every woman.. - Made for each other." "Made for each other" "Made for each other" "When God made a heart.." ".. He split it in two." "He gave them two names.." ".. Radha and Krishna" "Now the two hearts beat." "They part and they unite." "For they are made for each other." "Made for each other." "Made for each other." "Made for each other." "l didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "l didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "..the first look of love.." "..stole my heart away." "Stole my heart away." "l didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "..the first look of love.." "..stole my heart away." "Stole my heart away." "Stole my heart away" "In the hide-n-seek of my first love.." "in the hide-n-seek of my first love.." ".. I took refuge in the shelter of his eyes without a thought." "Now I'm frightened.." "..because furtively, like a thief.." "..the first look of love.." "..stole my heart away" "Stole my heart away" "My hair disheveled, my gait uncertain as if I were drunk." "My hair disheveled, my gait uncertain as if I were drunk." "Were I seen, it would raise a million questions." "Oh, how do I go home?" "..for furtively, like a thief.." "..the first look of love.." "..stole my heart away" "Stole my heart away" "l didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "..the first look of love.." "..stole my heart away." Jimmy, is Rahul at the entry point? - No, Rahul's not here. What do you mean not there? He's supposed to enter in two minutes. Find him, fast! Oh, God. I'll be right back. "Stole my heart away" Shruti, did you find Rahul? - No. "Stole my heart away." "l didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "l didn't get an inkling when.." "..furtively, like a thief.." "The first glance of love.." "..stole my heart away." "..stole my heart away." "..stole my heart away." "..stole my heart away." Yes, very good. Keep it up, everyone. - Rahul.. Rahul! I've told you numerous times that.. ..you should be at the wing five minutes before your entry. When you're not there, I start fretting that you'll be late.. I got this idea at the last minute And I thought that if I shoot out on to the stage.. ..the audience will freak out, and that's what happened. And anyway, there was no goof up. What's the fuss all about? Look Rahul, I'm fed up with your last minute entries. Hey Nisha, I'm the director. I can change whatever and whenever I want, including you. Forget it. You'll never find another dancer like me. I can get Shruti to dance better than you. - Shut up! Nisha! Fight with him later. It's time to go on stage. Take the mike. - Go and tell Suppandi. - I'll tell. What? - What? Okay everybody, let's get the lights. Idiot. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'd like to thank you all on behalf of the entire team.. ..for making this dance show a huge success. Thank you so much. As you all know, this is the last night of this show. However, I promise you that we'll be back here in three months.. ..with a new story, new songs.. ..and a new name. Maya. Maya? - Yes, 'Maya' is the name of our new dance show. Thank you very much everybody, and good night to you. Cheers! Wonderful. - We had good fun at the show. Hey, hang on a minute. Rahul, this new play 'Maya'.. What's it all about? Tell us. Tell us Rahul. Please. - Get up. Tell us about it. - Okay, okay. Maya. Maya. I don't know. - What? - l don't know. - What is this? If you didn't know that, then why did you tell everyone.. ..that we're doing a new play called 'Maya'.. ..and that we'll do it in three months? Now look, even I don't know who or what Maya is.. ..but I do know that in three months we'll do a play called 'Maya'. Do you have in mind a girl who's like Maya? She's still in my imagination, nor in my mind. Nisha! I've got a girl in mind. Rahul! aren't you talking about Pammi, the Colonel's daughter? Am I right? Isn't it Pammi? Rahul, is Maya the kind of girl you can fall in love with? I don't fall in love with girls. Girls fall in love with me. - There he goes again. But Maya is the kind of girl that anyone could love. Maya is the kind of girl for whom you would leave your Soni. You dare not cheat on my sister. - Ballu, relax. Quite. What does she do? She comes in dreams. Is Maya beautiful? Very. This Maya must be doing something. She must be working, singing, dancing.. Maya dances, but not like you. - What? - She dances only for herself. Excuse me, but she is a feeling, A fantasy, she's beautiful.. ..and she dances, and we've got to find her in three months. So who is she? Maya is all these things, and yet she is only Maya. Oh, Rahul. There you go again on the same topic. I'm hungry. I'll get something to eat. okay? Hey, leave him alone. - You all carry on. I'm coming. Maya. I've spent my life managing chores. I'll make a decision today. Good morning, aunty! - Silly girl! Where were you? I've been looking for you all over. - I was outside. Now you must to come with me. Where? - I'm tired of you uncle's daily nonsense. So, today there will be a fight, and you must take my side. Okay. Let's go. "Sometimes, a thought.." "..crosses my mind.." Bravo, bravo! "As if you all have been called only for me." Wow. - "You've been scrubbing dishes so long.." "You've been made to sit in the audience for my sake." Bravo, bravo. What a performance! Sir. Excuse me, Sir. Go on, Chandni.. I mean, Shanti. If you permit, could we have a tea break? Break whatever you want. If you don't mind, may I have a word with your students? Of course. Watchman, gardener.. - Yes, ma'am. Shankar and Ramu. - Yes. If you don't mind, will you all get back to work now? Where are you going? - Thank you. why are you driving away my audience? - Quiet. You gather all the servants here and stall all the work. I have to do all the chores myself. Today onwards, no more music recitals. Henceforth, only you will listen to your music. No audience. My music isn't appreciated in my own house. How would anybody else appreciate it? Thanks to your aunt's attitude, I could never become a great singer. I know, I know. Now forget it and have a cup of tea. No, I don't want any tea. - Oh come on, Uncle. Have a cup of tea, and sing a song for me. Will you listen to my song? - Of course. Really? - Certainly. So let me have the tea. Pooja. There's a parcel for you. It's from Ajay! Should be his cassette. I'll hear it right away. - Hear my song first. Later, Uncle. please! See that? You always drive my audience away What are you dreaming of? I was thinking how fast time flies. It seems like yesterday that Mr. Khanna and Geeta had that accident.. ..and the ten-year old Pooja came home. And now, it seems as if we never had a life without her. And I have never seen such close friends as Pooja and Ajay. 'Hey, fatty! How are you? ' Shut up, I'm not fat. 'I've heard that these days you've really put on some weight.' 'Don't do that or no one will marry you! ' Idiot. Don't worry about my marriage. Who's going to marry you? 'By now, you must have finished cursing me. So I'll proceed.' 'I'm having fun, as usual, and work and girls are keeping me busy.' 'Tell you what? I never realized how handsome I am when I was in India.' 'Don't make faces. If you wish, I can fax you.. ..a list of my girlfriends.' No, thank you. 'For your information.. I've broken up with Tina..' '..because she doesn't Like Hindi films.' Thank God. She was so stupid. 'And now I've fallen for someone else.' - Who is she? 'Don't yell, I'm telling you. She's Dolly.' - Dolly? 'There's no need to worry. She loves Hindi movies.' Wow. - 'Oh, I forgot.' 'l might be coming to Bombay for a few days.' - When? 'No need to stand. Sit down.' 'It's not fixed as yet. As soon as I get to know, I'll tell you.' 'Okay, I'm off. Dolly must be on her way..' '..and even though you haven't said so, I'll convey your affections.' There's no need. - 'Okay, I won't.' 'Hey. Here she comes. Okay, I'm going.' 'Give mom and dad my love. Take care, bye.' - Stupid. Hi. Nisha, where have you put that cassette you took from my car? There was a really important music piece of our play on it. Anything that goes into your room vanishes forever. Where is the cassette? Rahul, don't you have the manners.. ..to knock before coming into a girl's room. Is there a girl here? I.. Stop it, Rahul. I'm serious. Look, don't give me all this girl talk. Please! You have also entered my room at times when I had nothing on. So? That's different. - Why is it different? Don't I feel shy? Shut up, Rahul.. - You shut up! Go on now. Get my cassette. Oh. Thank.. First say sorry, and then you'll get the cassette. Must I say sorry? - Yes. Say sorry to you? - Yes. Why you.. Nisha. Nisha, give that here. Don't play stupid games with me. - You stupid. If I catch you, you're dead. - I'm not giving it to you. I'll get you. Give me back my cassette. Come on, give me back my cassette. Give it to me. - I won't! Give it to me, I say. - Okay, okay. Now say you're sorry. - Sorry for what? Sorry that you've wasted my time, and made me run around. I'm not saying sorry. - You won't? I'm sorry. - Say you'll never annoy me again. I'll never annoy you. - Say 'Rahul is the best'. Never! Rahul is the best. Okay? - I know. Thank you very much. Rahul is the worst. Rahul is a dog, Rahul is a monkey. Come what may, I'm not going to dance in your play. So be it. I'll find dancers like you aplenty. There isn't a single dancer as good as me. "Fall in love." "Lose your heart to someone. Fall in love.." "Fall in love.." "You're still young. Someone out there is meant for you." "Find him, oh, lovelorn heart." Pooja! "You are young. There's somebody for you." My wedding has been fixed. - Wedding? I'm sorry. - Six, seven, eight. "Fall in love.." "Fall in love.." What's wrong with you, Anjali? You're going to marry someone you haven't chosen? Someone you hardly know. I do know him. He's Mr. Kapoor's son. I've known him for years. But you don't love him. Well, Pooja. Love will happen in due course. Love happens in due course? Are you saying that, Anjali? We're not kids any more, Pooja. It's time we out grew our world of fantasies. We are Indian girls. Our companion for life is never same as the man in our dreams. We don't even choose him. Someone else chooses him for us. We learn to love him. This is the truth, and the sooner you realize it, the better. Don't make this mistake, Anjali. Someone, somewhere is made for you.. ..and you should wait for him. Perhaps he is the one. I believe that this is the one who was made for me.. ..and I'm going to live through with this belief. And who knows? This might happen to you. Tomorrow you might marry a man whom you merely know.. ..and slowly you might realize that he was the one you were waiting for. "There's someone for you. You find him out." Nothing like this is going to happen to me. I'll choose my companion myself. This is impossible, Rahul. There can't be a girl like this. What does that mean? - It's a meaningless character. Maya refuses to come out of her dreams. Modern girls aren't like this. What do you know? You're not a even girl. Stop it, Rahul. I'm serious. Modern girls.. - Maya is not one of these modern girls. She's different. She is my Maya. Your Maya, indeed. What do you know about girls? You know only one. And that's me! What do you mean? I don't know anything about love.. ..and yet I make love stories. What of it? Rahul, your Maya looks absolutely crazy to me. Don't you call my Maya crazy. And you are the only one who thinks like that. Nobody else talks like this. - Definitely! Rahul, I think Nisha is right. - Thank you. I don't understand 'Maya' either. Her character seems fake. Isn't it Raju. I agree. Looking at it from a psychological point of view.. ..I feel that you're on your own trip of Utopia. I'm on a fantasy trip. I'm sorry, Maya is not in. I'm sorry. You want to say something too? - I think we need a lunch break. Exactly. See? I don't know if such a girl exists or not..and I don't want to. Whether she is a lie, a fantasy or crazy or whatever.. ..she's Maya. If you don't understand this, I'm very sorry, I can't help it.. ..But all of you get one thing straight. I am not going to change Maya's character, come what may. Excuse me. What's this? - I think Rahul's right. You shut up. You are Rahul's yes-man. I was only saying that.. - Okay.. what were you saying? Do you know of such a girl? - No! Is your Soni like this? - No. You figure the character of Maya? - No. Should we do this play? - Never. That's exactly what I've been saying. - Right, but.. Not again. - Hey, what is going on? What do you think you are doing? - Shut up. "That innocent face." "The mischief in her eyes." "Oh my!" "That innocent beauty, with mischief in her eyes.." "..stands afar shying away." "Oh my!" "For a fleeting moment she shows herself, and then turns away" "Oh my!" "If you look with my eyes, friend, you can see her." "That innocent beauty, with mischief in her eyes.." "..stands afar shying away." "Oh my!" "For a fleeting moment she shows herself, and then turns away" "Oh my!" "If you look with my eyes, friend, you can see her." "That innocent beauty, with mischief in her eyes.." "Oh my!" "She's no ordinary girl, she's a wonder." "How else can I describe her?" "Last night she came in my dreams with her tresses flowing."

I need you, too. Oh, Clem. [Sighs] Whoever it is that you think you found, it's not your dad. I'm sorry, but he's gone. And you know that. Not according to the IADG. I have their files. I have proof. I can't help you. Yes, you can. No, I can't. Okay? I can't do this again. I went to Pangaea, Clem. I-I spent years chasing down every lead, hoping against hope that, that Mitch would still be out there and alive somewhere j-just waiting for us to find him, but you know what? He never was. It's real this time. I promise. And I know there's a part of you that believes me, that never stopped believing. And if I'm right, can you really risk not being there when we find him? [growling] I'm on my way. [snarling] [rhino roaring] [truck banging] I'm sorry. [snorts] ABRAHAM: Going somewhere? Abraham, I'm sorry. You were going to sneak off without us. I don't understand. You and Dariela have a home here. You have Isaac. He needs you more than I do. I can't let you go alone. It's too dangerous. You... This isn't up for discussion. You are not telling us everything, Clementine. The little girl I knew would never - pull a gun on... - People change. Clementine! [engine starts] This one is a 90% match to the alchemical symbol that represents 24 hours. And this one is a 72% match for the Indian rupee. Still trying to find the rest. Well, maybe it's... it's a code. No, no, it's gibberish. - He can't help us. - [Mitch pounds table] Proof? Proof. He wants proof. No, he's not ready. He's ready. Okay, look. Dr. Morgan, I'm afraid this is gonna come as a shock to you, but there's somebody here who's been waiting to talk to you. I can't believe you just let her go. It's not like I had a choice. Look, we'll just have to catch up with her. - What the...? - [squishing] What is that? It's a sample of the new hybrid Jackson sent me. But it was just a few drops of blood. It's growing. Yes. But into what? [sighs] Do we really have the rest of the night off? Mmm. Don't jinx it. We were out for ten days with that group. I'm gonna sleep for eight straight hours. Would you settle for six? I could be convinced to settle for six. [lock buzzes] [indistinct chatter over radio] Hey. I need to know what's on that drive, ASAP. Somebody went through a lot of trouble to get that. TESSA: Who's with the fancy coat? Is that the IADG investigator? She got here fast. - She's leaving even faster. - Hey! Excuse me, miss? I'll get started on it right away, Detective. In fact, if you bring me a coffee, it'll be ready when you get back. Deal. [rapid beeping] [people screaming] Where are Abe and Dariela? Isaac got sick. They had to take care of him. They'll meet up with us later. You look different. It's been awhile. Well, here goes nothing. Come on in. We'll be wheels up in five. [phone vibrates] Oh. WOMAN: Hi. Are you sure that you don't need anything? Food or-or water? Water, you've... you've had enough water for a lifetime. I'm sure that you have questions. I... [sniffles] I had a lot, too. When they first told me they found you, I couldn't believe it. And... part of me still doesn't, but... [sniffles] here you are. We're together again. It's going to be okay, Dad. You recognize me now, don't you? It's me. Your daughter. Clementine. Clem. Previously on Greenleaf. She's still not willing to come to a meeting. This may be a situation where you need to step up, lead, be the man. - Sorry to interrupt. - No interruption. Jabari Johnson. Who told you I did this? Mr. McCready's father, Henry. - What did Henry say, exactly? - That you paid him to burn down. First Baptist Church in 1983, the one Darryl James died in. I don't know what kind of deal you cut to get out of jail with this story, you're going back. I'm not going anywhere. Everybody at school knows. Is that why you took those pills? Yeah. Why isn't he in jail? Right here is the new pastor of Triumph Two, Jacob Greenleaf. - What do you have against me? - You killed my daddy. You're Darryl James's boy? We got a little trouble over at Triumph Two with the excavation. The water table's higher than the Geological Survey indicated. My life's not about you, Pop. It's about me. - He doesn't respect me. - I respect you. Ma'am? Is this the one you meant? - Shall we stay here? We're all waiting for the factory to be inaugurated. The moment the plant is inaugurated we'll hear the wedding bells. The date for the wedding matches this perfectly. Now we're just waiting for that auspicious date. And I hand over the business to my sons and be carefree. I've decided to hand charge of the company, the directorship to Vivek. I'd made her a promise. Once our sons are married, all my time will be hers. So the daily appointments dairy will be with her? You will be burdening Vivek with a huge responsibility. He deserves it every way. Wow! What news! Congratulations! You don't understand anything.! If Vivek becomes the company managing director... Adarsh will be one up on us! - That is true. - What will our son-in-law have? They will always have to obey Vivek. They will have to beg him for every little thing! What shame in asking your elder brother? Power can corrupt. Family relations are forgotten. This concerns our daughters too. You are very good friends. Do something and stop this from happening. Take the wife into confidence. - Why? - The minds of women work better in this regard. Don't worry. Follow me. We don't understand your making Vivek the MD. - Why? - Is that fair to us? With Vinod and Prem? Such an important announcement and you simply said it. No party, no celebration. Dharmraj is most upset about this. That is why he has decided that tomorrow before we leave for town... He will distribute Jaipur sweetmeats to the village! Why did you have to do this? May the Lord always be kind to you. My good fellow, everybody is blessing you for this! All of you are leaving. We will be left alone. That is why we leave Sapna with you. Or we'd take her along. Next time, I'll bring him along. He'll stay here for a few days to learn the work. I'll come here to work but not make small talk. If I get the time... When do you leave for your studies abroad? Tomorrow night. Here are the sweets and savories. Keep them in the bag. I didn't make them. Did you...? Preeti made them. Don't you dare distribute them amongest friends! When will you return? How can I say? Only till the exams. Then he'll be with you. Write a love letter to mother everyday instead of to Preeti. - You spoke again! - The flight is on time. Hurry up. You come here, I'll show you! Shall we leave? You may stay. This is very good. Going on a world trip with your wife. You'll have Prem's company on the flight. You're keeping the promise you gave your wife. And I'm keeping mine. Leave this veil behind for some days. She'll wear jeans abroad. Come here. Sit with Papa today. I had to make an important phone call. Try to understand the important phone call after engagement! This will be a daily occurrence. Did you decide the color for your room? Prem, let us know your choice too. I have to make rooms for both of you before your marriages. Vinod has given me a long list. You too must tell me. What can I say? As Preeti wishes. He has really changed. I'll just say this. All three boys should have similar rooms. They are the same. Vivek's is up stairs and Prem and Vinod are down. They too should have rooms upstairs. Why shouldn't they get a garden view? Later these are the issues that will create fights between them. She's laughing. - Uncle is here. - Good day to you. Welcome. Since when do you have this ailment? Excuse me, I think I'm going through a bad phase. Get them in. I've brought some sweets for Janmashtami, from Agra. Pass them here! You are our favorite relative from all the three! Call Papa in the office and tell him brother is here. Don't disturb him in work. I've come to meet sister. First of all do something for us. What can I say in family matters? You have all the rights. - You're giving your daughter! - Yes. That's right. You get after every little thing! Excuse me. Sangita here. I've been thinking of you since morning. - How are the kids? - All fine. Are you feeling all right? - Yes, is Vivek home? - He's in the office. I'll talk to him there. Nothing special. Bye. Don't worry. Give the line to Anand. Something important cropped up. We'll discuss this later. I don't know what exactly happened between Anand and Anurag. But Sangita and Anand are quite worried. They have called me there. Why are you crying? What's the matter? You are aware that we have been a tight knit family. Brother Anurag, Jyoti, Sangita, me and the three kids. We've had no ill feelings. Since Anurag called us from Rampur... He seemed changed. I thought it was tension of work. But yesterday he called us and said... We must look for a separate business. A separate home. Anurag said that? I can't believe it. It is true. After doing computer engineering my work has been technical. Brother looked after the company accounts and finances. When he transfered the company property and shares to his name... We didn't realize it. Tell me, did your father make a will? - No, Uncle. - Then forgive me... Your brother has no legal right to grab everything! We can go to court and stake a claim in everything! You will get your right! - No, Uncle. - No? The work that father started with such love and efforts... I don't want to drag it to court. And then how can I fight my brother? This concerns your life. Life can be started again. We thought we'd shift to Banglore. It has a growing computer industry. I have friends there. I'll begin a new project. That's not so simple. And you have the responsibility of Sangita and Radhika. That's the only thought that makes me nervous. Then I called Vivek. When he was in agreement with my decision... I took Anurag's blessings and left. Did we take the right decision? We're all proud of you. The only sad part is... The family is broken. They will be one again. Absolutely. Come here, baby. Come to me, child. I'm very worried. How will Anand establish his work alone in a new city? There's no need to worry. I just spoke to Mr. Richard. He's our agent in London who also deals in computers. He wants Anand to join him and look after the South India business. And there's no problem about accomodatiion there. I have a flat there. Sangita can be comfortable. Vinod and I will leave for Banglore today itself. We'll return only after settling them. Consider these difficult times a test. You'll see there's some good hidden in this too. - Take this, my dear. - May I take two more? Sure. Here. One for Raju and the other for Bablu. I'll give it when we meet. Radhika will miss Raju and Bablu a lot. Shall we leave? Yes brother. See you Mummy. Take care dear. "In happy times or sad..." "They who come to the Lord's refuge face no obstacles." "Time and religion may fail you." "Surrender yourself at the Lord's feet and gain solace." "Mother don't let your mind get poisoned by unfortunate." I'm very worried. What happened to Anand shouldn't happen to us. I don't understand... I've come here from Rampur only to explain this to you! Ram Kishen is appointing Vivek the Managing Director. That's good. But in the future if there's a misunderstanding between the brother? What he means is, getting charge of the business like Anurag if Vivek blesses Vinod and Prem and sends them out of the house. Vivek loves his brothers more than his own self! Excuse me but the most loving man changes on getting power. You sang praise of Anurag. What happened? Truthfully speaking, I couldn't bear to see Sangita's sad face. The thought brings tears to my eyes! The ones whose children played in Sangita's lap... Played with Mumu... They did this! With the real brother! If a real brother could do this, don't forget Vivek is a step brother! You can't deny the truth. Yes, today Anand is facing such problems. He called Vivek to advise him about what to do. And what did Vivek do? Tell me the truth, if he really had the heart of a brother... Would he leave his sister mid stream? He would fight, do anything! He'd get her her rights! He wouldn't wash his hands off his sister's responsibility. You and your husband are very generous. You bore your daughter's sorrows with a smile. But if this same thing happens to Prem or Vinod... Pritam and I won't be able to bear this sorrow. We've given our daughters to you. Now their joys and good fortune lie in your hands. What are you doing? Vinod will fight and have his way. But what about Prem? Don't we all know him? He's way apart from worldliness. At least think of him. Your husband's dream is great. The entire family lives together happily! But is it possible? Can two brides live together without fighting? - Show me one house. - Don't forget... The man who runs the office, his wife rules the home. In the future if Sadhna doesn't make Preeti and Sapna... dance to her tune... I'll eat my words. In your shoes I would never hand the family to Vivek and Sadhna! The truth is however much you may love Vivek and Sadhna... He is not your own! He is not your blood! Yes Sangita, is everything settled there? I see, Anandbabu has gone to the office with Vivek? And what is little Radhika doing? She's having breakfast. Here, talk to her. Grandpa, I'm drinking milk by myself. I too am drinking milk. - How did you land there? - For goodies made by my daughter. In fact, I suggest you come here with your wife. I'll talk to her. Talk to him. Vivek and I will return by evening. Finally, the daughter is happy. Mummy hasn't eaten a thing since last night. She seems very worried. Send her breakfast upstairs. I'll talk to her. I just spoke to Sangita. She is happy. No need to worry. Let's go to her for some days. She will appreciate it. What's the matter? Some other worry? I don't want Prem and Vinod to go through Anand's experience. What do you mean? Why are you appointing Vivek the Managing Director? Is that all? Can Vivek ever treat his brothers in this way? Ask your own heart. You know him better than I do. I know that this family has 3 sons. Instead of giving everything to one divide everything between them. What are you saying? It's not too late. It will be done with love. And I want it done before Prem and Vinod get married. Do you know what you're saying? Split them up? Separate Vivek, Prem and Vinod? These children are our dreams! - You want to break them up? - What dreams are you talking of? Our daughter has been thrown out of her own home! Haven't we experienced highs and lows in life? Why are you becoming weak today? This is the time we must stay close and give strength to our daughter. I don't want to argue with you. For the first time I'm asking you for something. And I want it. What you want, you're asking for... is wrong! - Breakfast. - I'm not hungry. Mother. I know you are very upset at what happened with Anand and Sangita. Your thinking that this shouldn't happen in our family too is right. But if we split up like this... If this house is broken into three... Will we be happy? Think about it. When Sangita comes for rakhi... To which brother's house will she go first? And we still have to make Vinod's career. His innocence will be stifled in the division of business. Don't punish everybody for me. Don't break everyone up. I don't want to be the Managing Director. Sadhna and I will go to Rampur. The new plant has to be looked after. We'll stay there. I'll tell Papa to make Prem the Managing Director. I assure you that Prem and Vinod will never suffer as long as I live. Sadhna has brought you dinner. Eat a little. For our sake. Come on, mother. What are you saying? Both of you will go to Rampur! Yes, Vinod. What's wrong with it? Prem will look after everything here. And Rampur is not far Just a few hours away. All right then. If you have decided to go... And Mummy is happy about it... Then I too will go with you! - No Vinod. - Nobody will go anywhere! Nobody will go anywhere. May I come in, sir? Yes, come in. Have you brought all the papers? Give it another thought. No, Khan. The time for seperation is here. Sadhna and I are leaving for Rampur today. You won't go anywhere! I've given my word to mother. Mother, we're leaving. Vinod insists of coming along. I'll send him back soon. I'd also like to say this... Why this is happening? The reason behind it... People will ask us. Don't keep a load on your heart. No mother will wish ill for her son. Forgive me, father. I hurt you. Silly boy. Do the words of a son hurt a father? You are going. Go. I won't stop you. Emulate every quality of your brother. Only the fortunate are blessed with such a son and brother. What can I tell you? We brought her home with such splendor. Isn't it? Excuse my saying this but this is the law of the world... Gradually bonds break up. The times you spend together are yours. I'm glad you are keeping yourself busy with work. I've studied all the papers. Begin work on the electricity division. From today Vinod will join me at the factory site. How do you feel now? - What's wrong? - Nothing, grandma. Exhaustion, I guess. Don't make Vinod work too hard. That he will have to do. He should have full knowledge of production before the inauguration. So he can return and take training in finance and sales. I won't go back. I won't leave you and sister-in-law. What rain! Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law... They have returned. How are you, Vinod? - How was the first day at the site? - Don't ask! Today I realize how hard brother works! I'm starving! Have a wash. Dinner is ready. Go and call the little sir. What happened? He's dozed off. That's because he worked hard today. How sweet is the smile on his face. The smile has returned to his face. But I fear... when Prem returns... How will I assure him? I think we have talked about it. Yes. Prem returns today. Don't spoil our mood by repeating the same thing. Kindly leave us alone. I want to talk to my sister. I don't have anything left to say to you. The only sorrow is... Today I have no face left to meet Ram Kishen's eyes. On whose instigation did you do this? These butterflies? Those who never settled down, can't teach us to run our homes! They only want to watch the scene! They will end the play here and go elsewhere for the curtains! I am a lawyer. I've seen families bickering, relationships breaking up. I can only say that nobody has been happy breaking their families. Nobody can be happy. See for yourself! Your Prem has gone straight to meet Vivek. Instead of coming to see you! This is not possible. Why not? Son, we will return with you and Sadhna. We've shared so many moments of happiness with this family. I won't let it be overcast be clouds of sorrow! Today is such a happy day. We hear Sadhna's giving us good news. Accompany Prem even if only to share this good news! Adarsh, you tell Vivek. I understand your feelings and Prem's too. Nobody would be happier than me if Vivek Sadhna return to the fold. But Vivek's silence says a lot. Vivek is doing his duty. You do yours. Ram Kishen and the business needs you. Aunt, it is Ram Kishen's values that two brothers today fight for each others' happiness. All you brothers are the same. One heart beats in all three chests. For the first time I've seen you brothers fighting. The one we fight with... we love him the most. Listen to me, Prem. Go back before I become weak. The little fellow too is here. How are you? We're going to become Uncles. You the elder one, me the younger. Rosogollas from the sweetmeat shop. The first one is for Uncle. Bought specially for you. - No, I won't eat today. - Why? Just don't feel like it. - Not even one? - Just half... Have one. I'm glad though in a way, we are together. You don't talk to Prem. We'll talk to him. Sounds like him! Did you call for me? Yes, son. Come inside! Come in and sit down. Whatever your mother did, good or bad... It's for your good and Vinod's. A mother gambles all that she has for her children. So don't be mad with your mother. I say, what has she done? Since she heard, Sadhana is giving us good news... We've been spreading joys! We're distributing saris to all the ladies in Club. And this silver present for all friends and relatives. What else is required? Even a real mother wouldn't do this. May I leave? Everything will remain the same. Nothing here is the same. Neither you nor me. See what Vivek has written to me. Today Prem has become the Managing Director. Stay with him all day. Close to him. He has never measured relations with money. We always considered his simplicity his weakness. Actually that is his strength. Give him lots of love. May I ask you something? When the elder brother's love and father's blessing are with you... Why don't you sit on your chair? Why here...? This is elder brother's right. Whenever he returns, whichever day... He'll find everything the same. You worry for no reasomn. It will take Prem time to realize. We achieved what we wanted. He has become the Managing Director! You just make his favorite dishes and feed him yourself. We'll see how long the son will be mad with the mother. Bye bhaijaan. You haven't eaten a thing since morning. Eat something now. Yes Bhaijaan. Wash up and come. Dinner is ready. No, mother. I'm not hungry. All your favorite dishes. I made them. I'm not hungry. I've shifted your things to the room upstairs. Where are you going? To bring my things back from Vivek's room. You and Preeti have to stay here after marriage. How did you even think of it? The entire fault is mine! I'm to be blamed! I love you so much! Fight the world for you! Doesn't a mother have this right? She does. Only if she doesn't differentiate between the kids. I didn't do anything. Vivek left on his own. And you let him go? Tomorrow if I want to leave everything and go away... Will you let me go? Won't you stop me? Right from childhood, Vivek has respected you more than us. He has loved you the most. And you forgot all this! Try to recall. The Prem and Vinod for whom you're fighting yourself... They would have left you and gone away long back! If Vivek hadn't lost his arm to save their lives! For what happened to Sangita, you're blaming brother Vivek. Thinking of Sangita brings tears to our eyes. The name of Anurag fills us with anger. But are we less at blame than Anurag? The Sadhna whom we lovingly brought home as a bride... We made her a stranger in a moment! When she waits at the foot steps of motherhood! Isn't this discrimination? You've acted as a step-mother, not Vivek! Nobody can take the place of brother Vivek and Sadhna. Neither in this house nor in this room. Nor in this heart. And if your conditiion is that I step into Vivek's shoes... and Preeti into Sadhna's... I swear by Sadhna, I will never get married! Uncle, forgive me. I can't get married. I knew this would be your decision. The country that honors the brother as a father and his wife as mother... Prem will never crush their joys to erect his own palace of dreams. I knew it. I had already told Preeti. Won't you stay? I wouldn't have been able to take Sadhna's rights even if you asked me. Sit down. Whether we're tied in a bond or not... We're tied in an emotiional bond of hearts. Isn't it? Don't worry about Sadhna. Her delivery is my responsibility. It will be a normal delivery. You might have to go to the hospital any moment. - Sit down. - See what father sent for you. A little Krishna. He wants you to always keep this idol in front of you. - Give it to me. - Why are you staying here? - Sapna is here. - I've taken official leave from sir. I'm going to stay here till you deliver. Tea... Doctor, Preeti is staying here leaving all her work. And Sapna isn't taking part in her college cultural program. I have three daughters not one. Vinod will complete training by the time the factory is inaugurated. Then we'll send him back to the city. Time just flew by laughing with Sapna. We didn't realize anything. Time moves at its' own pace. Time takes its' tests all the time in some way. I don't understand! Why has productiion in the factory stopped? We faced technical problems earrlier too! Sir, Anand could tackle them. I've heard this a number of times. Quickly appoint a good engineer. In this manner, we won't be able to clear the bank loans! I'm on my way. Now how are they? They still have high temperature. Jyoti mentioned that they haven't been eating well for some days. They've stopped playing too. - Yes. - Anyway continue the medicines. Inform me tomorrow morning. I have to talk to you. I want to say something to you as your family doctor. Children are as delicate as flowers. If they don't find a loving enviroment, they wither away. And that's not good. I'm unable to give them time because of my problems at work. I often lose my temper with them. Yesterday you raised your hand at them. They were being stubborn. They wanted to go to Anand and Sangita. Why don't you give in to them? Don't lose the peace of your family to personal grudges. Or no doctor will be able to help. Anand and his wife have come! With Radhika! Brother! You didn't inform us that Raju and Bablu were so ill. We left as soon as sister-in-law called up. You didn't consider us family. Forgive me. Forgive me. What are you saying? I had turned blind with selfishness. I acheived one success after another in business. I assumed it was because of me. But after Anand left, I found out the success wasn't mine. But of our team. Since Anand left home, without asking or taking anything... I haven't had any peace. I lost everything I had. The happiness of the children. The smile on Jyoti's face. But we're together again! We will live together. Today is such a joyous day. My daughter's house is settled again. We've come to ask you for something. Ask brother Vivek to return home. It was Vivek's belief that we'll be together again. I remember the day we were leaving for Banglore... He placed his hand on my head and said... All your sorrows be mine May all my joys be yours. I've committed a grave sin! A grave sin! Nothing is lost. Look there. No, Mamta. You are the same Mamta for me. ...who gave our children such a noble upbringing. Made them such good humans. Shall we go to Rampur? We are going to be grandparents. Yes, Sadhna needs you the most at this hour. Anything to worry about? No, Sadhna is fine. Start the final testing of the machines. We're off to the hospital. - Brother is here! - Hurrah! - You've become a Papa! - You have a son! Many congratulations. - You...? - Talk later. Sangita, take him in. Let's go. Mother... I've come to take my daughter-in-law and grandson home. I won't take him. You left. Not once did you ask your mother... What is my fault? Attentiion! The heir to the family is making his entry! - Give the baby to me! - No! - I'm the aunt! - No! It's the Papa's turn first. No, first of all it's the turn of Papa's mummy. Aunt, compared to all the joys of the world... The joy of becoming a grandmother is the best. Mother, all of us are in line to meet the baby. - Me, first. - Sure. Aunt before the Uncle. Let's love him together. It's also the right of the elder uncle and aunt to love the baby. Yes, Prem. One day for my sake... You took a pledge in front of mother. Today for my sake I want you, You take another pledge. Garland her. Here is your Mummy! - Okay, you may... - I have garlanded her. Sister-in-law, on thid joyous occasion I've brought special sweets! You really do too much! Forgive me for all that I did so far was with ulterior motives. Blinded by love for my daughter. I fed flour to the ants, watered the god of the trees. - Prayers, invocatioin... - Yes, I did all that. But I couldn't shake the foundation of your family. Mother Ram Kishen is right. It's all a game of values. I feel an anxious desire of love Love means possession, possession means blood and blood means death Because death to me is the logical result of the act of love I'm waiting for you, my lovely prey Who are you? What do you want? No, please! Who's there? How much is this? -Three dollars - Ah, okay -Have you seen this shirt? -Oh, yes, it's nice -Do you like it, don't you? -Yes, but how do you know? -Because it was made specially for you Who was created first? The chaser or the innocent prey The beast or the depraved human being The beast or the depraved human being What nook of a distant nowhere come I from? Why thirst and madness become suddenly the same feeling? Our truth will survive in spite of the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy Come here! Take clothes off! Sit down - Thank you -Anything to drink? -A Scotch, please - Thank you You you are an architect An architect in Ankara, your name is Turcun And you have a beautiful future -Your scotch, madam -Thank you I'm seeing love, today is your wedding anniversary The twenty-fifth ¡Oh, congratulations!

Bring her to me, Maga We are already good friends She wants to see you too But you have to be careful with her, she's an innocent child Come, come...

T1 6, clear! T1 9, clear! Name: Hee Secret Agent, 8th Special Forces. North Korea Born in 1971 Specialty: Sniper Classification: Confidential October 1996 Inchon Port, South Korea U2. Do you copy, U2? U2. Do you read me? "Good-bye" It's already been six months since Hee went into hiding. Maybe she was taken back due to the risk of exposure. - Hi! - Hi! I dreamt about U2 last night. He said he'd busted Hee. Good-bye. You know this song? I don't like music. You know that, don't you? September 1, 1998 Seoul May I help you? I was having a little chat with my buddies. About what? Love. And? They say love's to stay together until the last moment. They know the pain of separation. I bet they do, seeing each other sold off. Have you ever seen fishes cry? How do they cry? Cry in the water, then you'll know how. You're about the same size... as my boyfriend. Have you ever seen fishes laugh? No. It's already been a year. It was raining then, too. You came back the next day with a CD for me. - I said, "May I help you?" - "Anapus." Yeah, you said "Anapus" instead of "Anabus". "Bus!" It was a strange feeling. A total stranger gave me a CD I really liked. It was coincidental, but you felt so close, as if I'd known you for a long time. Did you go to alcohol cessation class today? The doctor said that I no longer had to come. Take a guess. Ki Ki? Ki. You're unbelievable! They're Kissingurami. Kissingurami. If one of them dies, the other dies too. They dry up from malnutrition or their scales fall off. Don't let them die. Feed them once a day, and change the water-- Every five days. They don't survive where it's dark and cold. Keep the lights on all the time. I might do the same thing if you left me alone. Under the slogan of "Reunification of two Koreas"... a team of North and South for the World Cup 2002... A friendly game will be held on the 25th... not only to pick players for the team... but to mark a turning point in history... where the two leaders of South and North Korea get together. - Yes? the game would speed up the reconciliation of the two Koreas. Change of plans. The third floor, electronics. - What happened? - Not clear yet. Any barrier? Around the third block. Take the outside! Calm down. I'm a secret agent. Why did you run? She was here. She knew about our rendezvous. Who? - Where? It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Please don't put ashes into the fishbowl. My goldfish smokes, too. Dr. Min, identified It's a lovely Wednesday when our fish take a bath. Hey, oddball! Lim was the head of black-market weapons dealers. We knew nothing about his organization. When'd he call you? Right before I called you. The perpetrator was there at the same time. Considering the fact that he was at the scene... he wasn't being followed. Otherwise he would've been killed before the rendezvous. I'll tell you the details later, but it's about my client... who is onto something very dangerous. Let me tell you again. If you don't protect me-- His life was being threatened during the weapons deal. Our priority is to find out who his client was. We went to meet him right after the call. The big question is... how'd this client know we were meeting? Autopsy reports came out. From the first to the fourth cervical vertebrae... one bullet went through between the third and fourth... and the other penetrated between right and left atrium... which killed him instantly. The heart was completely destroyed. I've never seen anything like this before. Good-bye. Chodo Harbor, North Korea For the victory! For the victory! No more corrupt politicians! No more 50 years of separation, disgrace and humiliation! We're writing a new history of Korea! And the beginning of it is in your hands! Good luck. For the unification. For the unification. For the unification. For the unification. Team 4, go! Don't move! He left nothing related to his business. No wonder. They destroy everything that could be used against them. It's hard to find any connection between Lim and Hee. Then we're back to square one. People around Lim? Lim took care of business by himself. Nobody knows anything. Hee's been hiding out for over a year. I don't get it. A weapons dealer was her first target. It's too easy for her. Aren't we overreacting? Could it be a gang war imitating her? Nobody can imitate her. We need to find out what she wanted from him... and why he contacted us. What did Hee ask him for? What was the information Lim tried to give us? If she hasn't gotten what she wanted from him yet... she'll try to get it through other channels. We need to focus on the fact that North Korea's using her again... even though her identity has been exposed to us. You two are the best agents we've got. Finish her at your first opportunity. What do you think was their relationship? Why'd she approach him? I guess she needed something from him. That's it. That thing she asked him to get her. That's the key. What'd he mean by something dangerous? You look awfully serious. We're late, come on. I got delayed at the beauty parlor. Have you waited long? Not long. How do I look? We'd better hurry. Did you sleep well? Did I snore? I was worried about that. He always sleeps at the theater. You two are here. He isn't into anything. He doesn't even like to sing or listen to music. Really? I grew up near the airport 'cause my old man was a pilot. So I can't tell a noise from a rhythm. Nothing's music to my ears. Then, what do you like? I like looking for people. Lately I've been looking for my ex-girlfriend. What's she like? You want to take a look? She's cute. Why did you break up? So I can look for her. Gosh, I'm sorry. - No problem. - Wipe it off with this. Here. - I am really sorry. - It's okay. It's punishment for dozing off in the theater. Excuse me. - When is your wedding day? - 20th of next month. When are you gonna tell her? - You can't hide it forever. - I don't wanna burden her. What about her? What if you die on a mission? - I can't anyway. - Why not? You don't trust her? Let me ask you something. If Hee and I point a gun at each other... and you have to choose one, who would that be? Hee, of course. I'd save your ass 'cause I can bust her later. You don't get many chances. You don't get many friends you'd die for either. It's not too late, man. You can change your mind. Cheers. I'm all wet! Wait till that stain gets washed off. I've had it. Give me money for laundry. I'll pay for it when I do that again. - Aim well next time. - I'll try. - Where are all the taxis? - Let's take the subway. - In this rain? - You're wet anyway. Come on, let's run! You sure? It's gonna rain all night long. I like it. I don't think they do. It's bedtime for them. Looks like the rain woke them up. - What are they saying? - They want us to keep quiet. - How are your Kissingurami? - They fight a lot. One minute, they hate each other... next minute, they're hugging, kissing and stuff. They're always like that. When I go out, I get worried about them. If I am not there, you have to take care of them. I don't think I can. I can't even handle "Kissing" and "Anabus" at home. That's why you have to learn more. To live with them, you have no choice. Your sweater is almost done. I hope it looks good on you. What should I get you for the wedding? All I want is... whatever happens to me... you love and never leave me. That's all. Because you're the only one who truly understands me. Shiri, step one, on! Kim? He looks most suspicious on the transaction record. - Who's he? - National Defense lab researcher. As a part of a new weapons system being developed... Kim speaking. Yes. Okay. we launched the CTX project last year. If Kim was doing business with the weapons dealer... chances are very high that it was CTX. Tell me more about the CTX. CTX is a new type of energy... originally invented by Korea Energy Development Lab. We've been working on turning it into a weapon. At first, we had problems with its delicate detonation conditions... but the test we did last month was successful. People at your agency know about this too. It'll bring a sensational change to the military's weapons systems. How's it different from the conventional bombs? It's a liquid bomb. What's most amazing about CTX is that it's indistinguishable from water. When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color... and you can't detect the liquid itself with any devices. Yet the effect is ten times more powerful than... any other bombs you've ever seen. What if a black-market dealer got it? He could get the information on it, but not the CTX itself... because you need three or four approvals to release it. If Mr. Kim took a bribe to hand it over... he would've returned the money. Where's it made and kept? That's confidential. Sorry. But CTX has never been released until today. How are you so sure? When CTX is released... it goes through three authorization checkpoints... and this morning everything was in order. You're saying it was released this morning? For the weapon show tomorrow... it's being transferred to headquarters as we speak. Sera Mike 1, stop at Dongsan service area. Will Hee turn up? She wants the CTX. She wouldn't miss this chance. Why are they bothering us? They want two secret agents to ride with us. What for? What the hell is that? Sir, we need to check the vehicles. I wasn't informed of this. What's going on? We got a report of a possible interception of CTX. Your permit and I.D., please. The CTX is safe with us. Get out of the way. Didn't you hear me? I asked for your permit and I.D., didn't I? This is Sera Mike 1, we're stopped at a checkpoint. I don't have time for this. I'll fax it to you. If you resist, we'll have to arrest you. What did you say? We'll have to arrest you... or kill you. - Are you nuts? - I'm fine. Are you out of your mind? You fucking moron! Are you fucking nuts? Wait, look at this. What base are you from? Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea! Sera Mike 1, do you copy? They've been hit! It's worse than we thought! It's a bomb! Run! Hee asked Lim for the CTX... and Lim bribed the researcher to hand it over. But when they realized it couldn't be done... they planned to intercept it on the road. In the process, Lim and Kim were murdered... along with 20 of our armed guards. How much CTX was taken? About a gallon. It is enough to blow up an entire city. Any leads on the interceptors? Not yet, sir. Just an assumption that they're involved with Hee. But why would North Korea do that... in a time of reconciliation? We haven't seen the hidden camera mounted on the vehicle... but the gunfire at the scene makes me think... that they're highly trained North Korean militants. Their military system is falling fast. It could be a private organization wanting the CTX for their own purpose. The question is, what are they planning to do with the CTX? If it blows up in Seoul, we're finished. We also need to figure out why their target was the CTX. As you all know, it may explode without the detonator. And no devices can detect the liquid itself. If they utilize those traits, expect the worst. There's no way to predict when, where or how it's gonna go off. - Dinner? - I don't feel like it. Is the meeting over? - Little while ago. Anything special? Ready to order? - Hi. - Hi. - Beer, please. - Okay. What about the scene? An inspection ofthe scene was delayed and the bodies were just taken to the headquarters. The film will be handed over tomorrow. Any leads? Just bodies and shells. Isn't it strange? Anything else? This is the third time.Lim, Kim. This time CTX was intercepted. We went to see Lim right after the call... and to the lab right after we got the report. We're always a step behind. It's like they were reading our moves. There's a leak. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. Don't jump to conclusions.Today we went to the lab without notice. Kim didn't even know that we were coming... and he got killed five minutes before we got there. If that's the case, it's obvious. Only Director Ko and I knew about those killings and the CTX. And you made the report. Shiri 1's on line. It's been a long time. - How's my family? - They're fine. I miss them. Completion is near. You'll meet them soon. A barrier is in the way. Get rid ofit. Target? Kissingurami. Finish the job before the completion. Acknowledged. For the unification. For the unification. We're always a step behind. They were reading our moves. It's impossible unless someone inside leaked the information. - Hello? - It's me, Ho. - Can I see you tomorrow? -Sure. What's going on? I have a favor to ask. Call me at the police agency tomorrow. - Okay. - See you tomorrow. I'll call you. What are you doing there? You scared me! - You just got here? - No, earlier. I cleaned and did the laundry. Nothing was in the refrigerator. so I went grocery shopping. What's wrong? You don't look so good. Just busy at work. Why didn't you call? I was gonna leave soon. Dinner? Not yet. I had a late lunch. Let me fix dinner for us. - What are we having? - Your favorite. - You wanna take a shower? - After dinner. - I think it's done. - Let it simmer. Can you hand me the clothes pins and hangers from the sofa? - I couldn't find the pins. - It's okay. Leave it, I'll do it. When are you moving in? Soon, I guess. I haven't packed upyet. - Let me help you pack up. - Okay. With you here, it won't be as lonely. You hated eating alone and waking up by yourself. You'll whisper in my ear to wake me up from now on. I'll make the coffee, and you'll play soft music. Should we buy birds? You'd like birds singing in the morning. Promise me, that you keep the promise you made to me a year ago. Trust me. I'll never drink again. Because I have you. The soccer team of South and North Korea returned today... to the Seoul Training Center after training in Pohang... with North Korean officials coming through "Panmunjum." The North Korea President Lee and officials... coming to the south for the game and a conference... When it's in a normal state, there's neither smell nor color. You can't tell the difference from water with the naked eye. But it's a different story with the light on. Turn it on. It's on. CTX responds to daylight... over 6,000 kelvin. The light alone may start its reaction. But without heat, it's no good. Fire. What? Yes, sir. It's on, sir. If you expose it to both light and heat... nitro-alpha inside the sphere and beta outside react differently. But when the liquid in the sphere becomes red, the sphere pops. Nitro-alpha and beta combined causes the explosion. How much power does it have? This is about 200 cc, so everything within the radius of one kilometer would disappear. Since the detonation varies depending on the reaction... the sensor here tells you when it's exploding. Like now, if the sphere becomes red... it means the explosion is imminent. If you don't stop it before the sphere pops... it explodes. But with either light or heat removed, the reaction stops. I've never seen an agent like you in 20 years.You're an oddball. I am not, sir. - Admit it. - No, I am not. Admit it! Then I wouldn't be cleaning the fishbowls. Agent Ryu, come to room 17. I gotta go. Find the CTX as soon as possible so we can go drinking. We'll find it! Anyone recognize him? Don't you remember, Ryu? His name is Park.A top agent for the North Korean 8th special forces. When Ryu stormed the plane that'd been hijacked... he was the only one that escaped from the plane. A painful memory for Ryu. Clear! Hee and Park. All the pieces are coming together. Agent Lee? Find out what's going on with 8th Special Forces. And you get the daily data of spy satellites from National Defense. - Agent Yoon! - Yes, sir. Post Park's montage throughout the country. They're 8th Special Forces. It's worse than we expected. The 8th Special Forces intercepted the CTX. Why? Three possibilities here. First, to sell it off to a third country. Second, to use it on the negotiation table... for money or to seek asylum to another country. Third, a strategy they are known for... they say they want peace and stab us in the back. It must be either for the money or an explosion. If they wanted the money, why CTX? Robbing the Bank of Korea would be much easier. Why would they spoil the peace conference by using the bomb? That's difficult to answer. Hee is the key to all this. We don't have time. We'll find a way. What do you see? Can't even tell me? Maybe the solution is much closer than we think. - What do you mean? - Hee could be close by. Hey, you! - What the hell are you doing here? - I am looking for the men's room. Are you fucking blind? Didn't see the sign "Restricted Area"? Hey, you hear me? I sure did. Watch your mouth. - How have you been? - Bored to death. I feel more insecure when it's so quiet. I need some backup. What about your agency? - The air isn't very clear there. - What do you mean? I think there's a leak. This is the only way. - It must be very stressful. - It'll get better. - When do you need it? - Tomorrow. - I'm coming too. - Sorry, no married men. - Time and place? - I'll call you. All right, then. Ho! We'll talk later. How's your friend? He'll live. - I am glad to hear that. Have a seat. Who else knew you two were meeting? It was very personal. I didn't tell anybody. Lim, Kim, Ho. Hee is very nearby. There must be a leak. Nobody knows that for sure. Internal Affairs is on it. You don't trust your men? Do you trust me? Traps could be anywhere. Maybe there's a hole in the security system... but that possibility is almost zero. Don't share the information with anybody. Not even with your partner, Lee. Traps under your feet are hard to see. I'm the director in charge. I'm Park of the 8th Special Forces. I want to talk to my old friend. Thanks for calling me, friend. I was gonna send you a coffin, but you were lucky. Disappointed with Hee's shooting? Save it. We can take you out anytime. Maybe I'll take you out first. So, you've become a man.You know where I am? Young drunk kids here yelling on the street... while people in the north are starving to death. Listen, friend. We have ten CTXs placed all over Seoul. I'll call you 30 minutes before each of them goes off. You'd better find them before people get hurt. What do you want? Slow down, friend.The first one is on the roof of the Golden Tower. You have exactly 30 minutes. You know the fish named "shiri"? It's a Korean aboriginal fish, living in crystal streams. Though they're separated with the country divided... someday they'll reunite in the same streams. Should I buy some for your girlfriend's fish shop? Why not? Stay alive until then. He's on the move. Clear! Found it! Hyun? Don't tell anybody you're here. Page me if necessary, and never use the phone here. I checked you in under an alias. Don't go out. I'll take care of the shop. What's going on? Don't ask. Please do as I say. I don't wanna stay here. Hyun! You haven't touched a drop for a year. This is me. You know that, don't you? What is it? What? You wanna know what? Tell me what's wrong. Dear people of the South,to day marks an important and joyous moment in our history. I am here to put an end to years of confrontation and dissention... and to open up a new era of understanding. You got a call. Hello? A guy who knows everything about the CTX contacted me. He's Hee's informant, and he wants a deal. Where are you? I'm meeting him at the Hwain Cultural Center. I'm on my way. Be there. He's wearing a black jacket and a black cap. Anything else? - That's all. I'll be right there. You look good in a black jacket. Anyone else coming? Hee, maybe. So you called me expecting someone inside to leak the information? I hope it worked. Nobody at the agency knows that I'm here. You know it's impossible to tap the phones. So, if they show up... I'm the rat? The MSG-90 Hee uses is a five-shot semiautomatic. She used only two bullets, both for Lim and Ho. In both cases, you were in her range. If I were her I would have used the other three bullets. Three targets went inside. Acknowledged. Stay in position. The mole must have been found. For the unification! - Been a long time. - Good to see you. Payback time for flight 257. You killed seven of my men. You left your men behind. 'Cause I have a job to finish. You wanna know what it is? It's my turn to send you a coffin. Won't be easy! Get Hey. Hey. What's the with bad mood? Well, I don't really enjoy hanging out with a bunch of Hollywood skanks. Oh, come on. They're nice girls, Kimber. You said we were going to be alone. You'll get your turn. There's more than enough Mike to go around. Ok. Just give me a second. I'll be right there. I believe April is next. Excuse me. I thought I was the one you wanted to spend the rest of your life with. So did I. Wow. Crazy times, huh? I'll tell you what. It's a good thing you kicked my ass to the curb that final time. I mean, it's taken a shitload of curbs, but I think I finally got the message. I'm sorry about that. It was shitty. And I don't have an excuse other than I was obsessed with Christian. But I don't feel that way. And you're so good to me, and we're good together, and I just... I really, in my heart, feel that 2 people that are right for each other need to spend the rest of their lives together. Honey, , I've got more bumps and bruises than a rodeo clown. I can handle the pain, but after a while, you just get tired of being laughed at. Listen... do me a favor, will you, Kimber? I've got a Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1986 over at the bar. Why don't you be a sweetie and go get it? And bring a corkscrew. Hey. Kimber? The wine? Finally got the message. I'm sorry about that. It was shitty. And I don't have an excuse other than I was obsessed with Christian. But I don't feel that way. And you're so good to me, and we're good together, and I just... I really, in my heart, feel that 2 people that are right for each other need to spend the rest of their life together. Hey there. The wine? Not yet. I plan to take him to his favorite strip club and drop the bomb there, let naked women soften the blow. Uh, no. Not anymore. He kicked his wife out. Listen, Curtis, I was thinking we could author an article together based on this trip. I have an idea for a new procedure on patients with neurofibromatosis. Great. Ok. Yeah. Well, we'll talk about it when I see you in a few days. Ah. I got to go. Ok. Bye. What? Kimber fell off a boat last night. She's, uh... She's missing. What? Whose boat? See you in a few days. Ah. I got to go. Ok. Bye. What? Kimber fell off a boat last night. She's, uh... coast guard thinks she, uh... thinks she's dead. Wait. I... I don't understand what happened. She... She slipped and fell off the boat? I think she jumped. Jumped? Yeah. Suicide? Well, but the coast guard is still searching, so they could still find her. Impossible. 12 hours? Can't survive in the water that long, you know. I kicked her out last night. I told her I wanted her out of my life. I shouldn't have... I should have... I don't know what to do. There you are. Hey, Dr. Mcnamara, I wanted to thank you and Dr. Troy for the excellent care I've received here. Is he around? No. He's... uh... You look like you're healing well, Mr. Seabrook. I feel great. Today really is the first day of the rest of my life, and I'm not going to let another day pass doing things i don't want to do or feeling ways I don't want to feel. Good for you. I wish you luck with everything. Hope the same for you, Dr. Mcnamara. Goodbye. Blending in. You have no idea what ir's like always blending in. You forget who you are. Eventually, you start to forget who you ever were. They push you and push you further into the margins. Treat you like dirt. Take away your manhood. Make you small. Somebody had to do something about it. I hear you, Hollis. I really do. He used you, took advantage of your work, and cut you loose. It's a terrible thing. But I got people to answer to and they're already talking about kicking down doors. Look, since I don't think either one of us want to go down that road just yet, help me buy some time, send out the employees. No. No. That-that won't work. Let me finish. The deal is I get the bystanders, you keep Ken Lydecker. He's the only one you really want anyway. You'll still have leverage and I'll have something my bosses. We'll all get to live a little while longer. Human Target 1x01 Pilot Original Air Date on January 17, 2010 Sync, corrected by elderman - for addic7ed. com - All right. Everybody but Lydecker out. Let's go. Move. this way. This way. Keep moving. This way. Hey, buddy, we alone yet? Shut up, I'm- I take that for "yes. " 'scuse me. Are you Ken Lydecker? Yeah. Well, if you're out here, who's that inside? Whew. Where's Lydecker? Just give it a minute. You'll figure it out. I've seen you. You've been around here. You're the auditor. Not really. Listen, word of advice, never make threats. You want to do something, don't talk about it. Do it. What? Lydecker. You've been sending him threats for weeks. Got him planning. Got his guard up. Now look where you are. Threats just make things messier. No more threats. Just action. You just committed suicide for that snake, That rat. You realize that? Okay. Well, first of all, I don't think you can be both of those things at the same time. Second, you were a salesman. You got fired. Let's not do this like he had you working a chain gang. He took out eight years of my life. Left me with nothing. No severance. No savings. He broke me. And he deserves to die for it. No, he doesn't. Yes, he does. No, he doesn't! Nobody deserves to die. And frankly, after seeing your behavior this afternoon, I think Lydecker deserves a medal for putting up with you for as long as he did. What are you doing? I'm gonna take the gun away from you. Guns are dangerous. They're not for messing around. You think I'm messing around? I think we've been here for, what, six and a half hours? I'm tired. I missed lunch. Enough already. Are you crazy? Am I crazy? I'm assuming that was a rhetorical question. You don't want to go out like this, do you? No. So I'm gonna go outside. I'm gonna get as close to Lydecker as I can. And then I'm gonna finish what I started. And you can stand there and say whatever you want. That I'm about to do a terrible thing. That I can still get out of this. But it's not gonna change anything. This is still gonna happen. Hollis, what'd I tell you? No threats. Hello, Carmine. So how's your buddy today? Happy to be home. Morning, Winston. Checking up on me? Why, did something happen? I could care less about you. Who do you think's been feeding that beast the whole time that you've been laid up? I don't know. Figured you finally got a hold of the mailman. He's been eating him. Lydecker sent payment. This? Oh. Oh. Whiskey? It's not whiskey. It's a 25-year-old bottle of Takagi. That's $900 a pop. You know, when I suggested that we can keep transactions quiet by bartering instead of cash, I assumed you knew that I meant bartering for things of significant value. That stuff's not easy to come by. You hold onto it for ten years, it'll be worth ten times as much. Oh, so it's an investment. Exactly. Mm. You know, a guy who blows up the building he's standing in, you don't think him a long-term investor. We're still having this conversation? Really? I told you it was the only way to stop the guy from killing Lydecker and dozens of bystanders. Yeah, so you've said. However, What I'm trying to figure out is how the whole thing even got that far. Why not challenge him at the outset? You said the guy didn't arm the vest until late in the game. Why not disarm him cleanly beforehand? So you think I let it get that far 'cause I thought it'd be fun? I don't know. Why don't you tell me. Why don't you just ask me what you want to ask me. Are you slipping? I waited because I felt Lydecker was in no immediate danger. Do you really think that I would've pulled the trigger if I didn't know there was a bearing wall six feet away? If I didn't know that homemade fuse was gonna have at least a three-second delay? Where are you headed? I'm going to see Peale's got a referral for us. I can come. Ha ha. No. No, you can't. No. See, you can't 'cause the shop's closed. And it stays closed until you recover. No discussion. Thanks for worrying. But there's nothing to worry about. It was about a week ago. I get in the car to go to work and it won't start. Two hours later, I'm at the dealership and the mechanic comes out with this look on his face. He says "good news is your battery's dead. " Bad news is he found eight ounces of primasheet 2000 under the hood. Plastic explosive. I don't know why anyone would want me dead. I've never gotten threats. Don't have any enemies. I don't know what this is. That's why I need your help. And the police refused to grant protection? You know the deal with the department. Captain gave me two men, no overtime. Given the situation, it ain't hardly enough. The situation? What situation? Tell him what you do. I work for McNamara Engineering. I run the design team for the Monterey line. The California Bullet Train. You're looking at the lady responsible for the most expensive public works project in U.S. history. The last thing McNamara needs right now is more controversy surrounding the project. But I'm not here speaking for the company. I'm here cause she's my wife. With the train's maiden voyage coming up tomorrow, you can understand why we want to keep this information private. If you can help end this thing faster and safer than the police can, then you're the man we want. All right, well, um, We're not taking any new clients on at the moment. But, uh, I can refer you to another sec - no. I was told that you provide a unique service. That you're the people that I need. Why me? You can flush this person out, yes? Get him to reveal himself and take him out? I work with a cover. Blend into the background. Let you appear vulnerable so the threat reveals itself. And then eliminate the threat. I don't want to live my life in fear. Whoever's behind this shouldn't have that kind of power over me. How fast does this train go? Safe cruising speed is about 200 miles per hour. Would I get to ride on it? I assume so. Okay. I'm in. Let's go over the cover again. Who am I? You're Tony Graham, my new translator. Good. What happened to your old translator? the company provided one to deal with our Tokyo financiers, but she made too many mistakes so I hired my own. While we're on the subject, You are fluent in Japanese, right? Guess we'll find out, won't we? Mr. Situ wishes you congratulations on a well-deserved celebration and says that he's honored to be invited. Thank you. I'm so glad you could be here. What? They're our biggest investors. What did you just say? Oh, he wanted to know how I recognized that his dialect was satsuma-ben. Told him my grandfather was stationed in Tokyo. After the war, dated a steward from a small fishing village on the island of Kyushu. My grandfather sponsored him when he came to the U.S. for college. Became a friend of the family and he taught me Japanese. Wow, that's-is that true? No. Do you really think whoever's after me is gonna be on this train? Three hours in a confined space with no escape, no apparent security. This is where he makes his next move. Then why are you letting me on it? Because there's no escape for him either. When he moves, I'll be standing right next to you. In three hours, one way or the other, this thing is going to be over. When my father started this company, I doubt he'd have thought the state of California Could ever accomplish something like this. But in three hours, we'll be in L.A. Nothing will ever be the same again. And it's all because of you. So here's to you. Don't sweat what everybody says about her. I'm sure you'll enjoy working for her. What does everybody say about her? Well, that she's miserable to work for. That if you're not as smart as she is, you must be incompetent. That mistakes should be punishable by death. So it isn't true. No, it's true. So if she's so difficult, why does anyone put up with working with her? The truth? James. He protects her from everybody. Even McNamara. Ah, speak of the devil. I was, uh, just telling Tony here how everybody hates you- except for me, of course. Tom was James' best man. He introduced us. He's McNamara's general counsel. You'll have to excuse me. Our Undersecretary for Mass Transit insists on bugging me about the tab for today. So what was the tab for all this? All in? About $80 billion. How much of this came out of my taxes? About $62 billion. Even I want to kill you just a little bit right now. Well, it sounds like she's got enemies. Line forms the left. If there aren't at least ten people on this train that want her dead, I'd be amazed. Listen, see if you can pull the call logs on this phone. You know what, just out of curiosity, does she know you're on her phone? No. I swiped it. I want to see if she's talking to anybody interesting. I want to go 12 rounds with her on it. And another thing, see if you can find Guerrero. Let's bring him in on this. Oh, yeah, sure. Why not? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute now. You're not serious, are you? No one handles this corporate crap like he does. Do you really think you can trust that animal? Sure. As long as we pay him on time. Oh, get a load of this. I'm watching a guy who won't stop shifting his coat. She thinks I'm flirting with her. Anyway, see if you can pull the call logs. I'll keep trying to figure out how she got herself into this mess. Let me know when you find Guerrero. Oh, yeah. ♪ soldier boy ♪ ♪ oh, my little soldier boy ♪ You the guy who been digging around Soucha's Bank, asking questions, making trouble? And you're employees of the bank? You could say that. Well, I'm-I'm sorry, but your employer's involved with some pretty shady loans with this director's families. And my friends need to know just how shady if they're gonna make their case. So... afraid we're at an impasse. We're at a what? Impasse. It means we disagree without prospect of resolution. You know, we came here to explain it to you, but you don't seem to be getting it. Maybe the three of us can take a little walk out back to the alley. We can explain it a little better so there's no impasse.  I got to warn you guys, if this gets violent, I'm gonna fight back. You think you're gonna fight back? All right, maybe fight back's a little misleading. I'll take the beating 'cause that's all you two amateurs are cleared to do. And then one night soon, I'm gonna break into your houses and kill each of you in your sleep. Probably start with you, Alfredo. That way Steven here can have a few extra days with Marla and the girls. It's only fair. How do you know my name? Your employer keeps sensitive information on a drive he thinks is secure. It isn't. Shall we? This is Guerrero. Funny, my phone has the same ring. Yeah, go ahead. Guerrero is in. But listen, I went through her call logs. I found something here that could be pretty interesting. It's strange, don't you think, that we both have the same... Wait a second. That is my phone. Okay. Let me know what you find. You stole my phone. Do you know a times reporter named Mark Hoffer? He covers the project. He'd call me for a background or a quote. Why? Well, his name's not in your contact list, but his number shows up as incoming at least a dozen times, mostly unreturned. Well, I'm bad at returning calls. I haven't spoken to him in almost a year. What difference does it make? Hello? We've never met, but I think you know who I am. My name's Bill Arnold. I think you know what I've been saying about you in Sacramento. But now that I see what you've created, now that it's real, I think the first thing I need to say to you is I'm sorry. Evidently, you were worthy every penny. 'scuse me. We were having a conversation. Wait a minute. Just sit down. Keep your mouth shut. What's going on? The ice in your glass, it's cubed and no one else's are. Oh, my gosh. What happened? We need a doctor! Is there a doctor here? We need a doctor. Well, I rigged the door downstairs. that ought to give us a little bit of warning in case somebody comes looking for you. This was the plan. Flush him out. Get him to commit. Look at me. You trust me? So what do we do now? Well, he's irritated he's got to come to us. We let him make that mistake. Whoa! Son of a bitch. Hey. I need some information on a guy that works in your office. And you couldn't use a phone? Where's the fun in that? It's been a rough day. Let's just cut to the chase. Who's the guy? Mark Hoffer. Sacramento desk. Is that supposed to be a joke? Was it funny? You saying you don't know? Yeah. When? No such thing as a coincidence. Okay, keep digging. Mark Hoffer was killed this morning. With a car bomb. Same explosive as the one used in your car. Oh, my God. There has to be some sort of connection here. Now what is it? Uh, uh, about a year ago, he wrote a piece exposing corner cutting within the project. Hoffer got this information from an anonymous source within the company. Any Chance that anonymous source is sitting at the table with me right now? The cost cutting was jeopardizing safety measures. I kept telling them that a train this big and this fast had to be flawless, but they stopped listening to me. I had to do something. After that, McNamara got scared. He gave me everything I wanted. What else aren't you telling me? Nothing. Well, I don't buy it. People who get themselves in your kind of trouble are usually holding something back. Either it's pride, or they're embarrassed, or they're just stupid, so which one are you? You telling me I deserve this? Nobody deserves this. I'm just saying people have secrets. Secrets are dangerous. So what are you keeping from me? Do you hear that? Hear what? The brakes. They're squealing. So? This isn't a trolley car. If the brakes are squealing, something's wrong. So much for the flawless train. It is flawless. Get down. Tom. Let him go. Let him go. What the hell is going on back here? It's all right. It's all right? Bill's up there hanging on by a thread. It's a coin toss whether he makes it to L.A. alive. And then this guy drags you back here. He didn't drag me back here. W- wait a minute. It's complicated, but I'm okay. Then why did you pull all those emergency brake handles in the last car? What are you talking about? Tom, just go back downstairs. If anybody asks if you saw Stephanie, you say no. Stephanie, I'm your friend. You can trust me. Go. Hey, dude. Breaking and entering is a crime, you know. Yeah, it's good to see you too, Winston. It's been awhile. Oh, not long enough. What are you doing in my office? And what the hell are you doing on my computer? I'm checking out the contents of Mark Hoffer's hard drive. There's not much here. It's mostly personal. Do I want to know how you came about it? Editor at the paper owes me. Couple years ago, a gas company hired a guy to hassle him over a story he's working. Got nasty. I got him out of it. How? I decided to stop hassling him. Listen, you, don't get comfortable here. Because as soon as this case is done, you're gone. Spent too much of your life in an office, Winston. Look at you. It's made you weak. Yeah. No surprise, but I think McNamara management might be involved in this. That's good news. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. All right, cool. I'll, uh, I'll go pay him a visit. Well, how is that good news? Companies like this aren't built to off people, Winston. Tends to get sloppy. Someone talks, the wrong guys listen, and suddenly word's all over the street. Wait, who are you going to see? The wrong guy. Hate him. if Tom was right about these emergency brake handles, we might have a problem. The killer thinks you identified him, right? He's afraid he's caught so he wants to get off the train. He pulls one emergency brake. It doesn't work, so then he pulls them all. Well, that's what we want. He's panicking. He's getting that much closer to making a mistake. He already did. I think he blew out our brakes. Come again? The emergency brake system is complicated. Physical brakes combined with a magnetic system that's controlled by the computer. Problem is, the emergency brakes in the unfinished cars aren't tied into the computer yet. So when our guy kept engaging the disks, it must've overwhelmed the safety. So what are you saying? It's like going 100 miles an hour on the freeway with your foot on the gas and the emergency brake on. If we engage them again, they're gonna explode. I'm sorry, did you say explode? Yeah. It gets worse. There's a curve in the R-2 tunnel about 70 miles ahead. We need the brakes to slow down or we'll derail. If we do hit the brakes, and they blow up, they're gonna take the wheels with them and then we'll derail. 70 miles, that's, like, 20 minutes. Less. We need to warn everyone up front or a lot of people are going to die. Get ready to move. We should call up front, let them know what's going on. How did you-? Where's your phone? A vest? You wore a vest? Where's my vest? I'm your vest. Where's your phone? Back there. What about the intercom? Don't tell me. It's not hooked up yet. How you doing? Haven't seen you around for a while. Haven't been looking for you. Answer for everything. That's why I stopped finding work for you. You didn't know if you've heard of any work put on the street by a company called McNamara Engineering? Not to the best of our recollection. You sure? Hang on. I'll check again. Yeah. I'm sure. What do you care for anyway? You want to know if there's open work, but you don't want to take it. What, are you window-shopping? I see. You've gone over to the other side. You're fighting the good fight, making the world safe for democracy like your friend Chance. Word of advice, Give it up. Maybe it works for him, but not for somebody like you. Just making life hard on yourself, my friend. Companies have secrets. Husbands hate wives. Brothers envy brothers. What'd you just say? You want me to write it down for you? No. I got it. That's the- shh! What's the matter with you? If he hears us, we're gonna be dodging bullets. That's the grate to the next car. You can just unscrew it. We're running out of time. Hurry. Hi. Excuse me. In less than ten minutes, there's a very good Chance that this train is going to crash. I suggest that we get off it. I told you. I'm the interpreter. We need to get off this train. Off the train? You sound like a crazy person. What are you talking about? In a few minutes, we're gonna engage the brakes to take the R-2 tunnel curve. The problem is the disks are overheated. Once we engage them, the disks are gonna explode right out of their housing. This train is gonna go into the tunnel and it's not gonna come out. All right, uh, let's everyone take a breath here. This train is perfectly safe. Its brakes are perfectly safe. Damn it. Listen to me! Stephanie, we're only 18 miles out. Brakes engaged a few minutes ago. Now look, you disappear, you come back here, you're making a scene, you're getting everybody upset. Shh. Shh. Shut down the brakes. Shut them down now. There's a name for the kind of train this just turned into. How did this happen? It's a long story. I'll explain after we get everybody off the train. We're going 220 miles per hour. No one is gonna get off of this train. Run brake assist. There's a supplemental braking system in the rear car. It's too weak to slow the entire train at this speed. But if we separate the car, we can slow it down before it hits the curve. Okay. Okay. Let's get moving. Everyone to the back of the train. What the hell happened back there? He eliminated the threat. Did you recognize him? There's not much left of him. But there's enough to start digging into who hired him. Well, look who found the front door. Still got the call logs from the client's cell phone. Yeah. Good. Read me back the incoming calls from Mark Hoffer. I don't work for you. The dates and times, please. Um, August 20, 53 pm. April 24, 7:31 pm. February 25- What is this? Get Chance on the phone. The system isn't online. We'll have to cut the hydraulics manually. Is there time? We're fine. Once I disconnect the hoses, cars won't separate until the rear car hits its brakes. Why don't you let somebody else do that? I know the guts of this thing better than anyone. It's okay. I'll be okay. Go. Go. I'm sorry. For what? All this. I figure somebody should say it. Well, at least I know what I'll be doing Monday morning. What's that? Building the damn thing all over again. Is everyone onboard? Is everybody here? Yeah. Everyone's here. Hit the brakes. Down to the last connection here. Ready? I thought you said these don't lock. They don't. No. No. How much time? About two minutes to the tunnel. Maybe we could strap ourselves in. Hope the cars hold together. Will they? We're gonna die, aren't we? At this speed, the wake turbulence passing off the tail of the train, it's gonna run just north of level, right? Excuse me. The wake, the turbulence, the wind coming off the back. Yeah. There'd be a bit of an updraft. About 160, 170 degrees? Roughly. How did you know that? Lucky guess. Cut two of those seatbelts as close to the seat as you can. Wait a minute. No, no, no, no. What are you afraid of? Dying. It's not gonna happen. Come on. This'll be fun. This isn't gonna work. I'm open to suggestions. Here. Put this on. Exhale. Hard. Can't believe it's over. It's not exactly over. Be kind of nice to find out who's behind all this, don't you think? Well, at least it's over for a little bit, right? We'd like to thank you for everything. But I think after all this, it might be nice to go home, be alone tonight, just the two of us. Okay. Thank you. Hello. I just finished looking at the expense reports of a reporter by the name of Mark Hoffer. Who is this? They include a number of expenses at a hotel in Laguna. These stays coincided with phone calls placed by him to Stephanie's cell phone. When did you find out your wife was sleeping with Mark Hoffer? Forgot your tie. See, I had a hunch it wasn't the assassin who tried to stop the train and escape. It just didn't fit. It was you, wasn't it? And once your guy missed with the ice cubes, you figured things might be getting a little bit out of control. You're afraid that if I caught him, he'd finger you, and everybody on the train would know that you hired him to try to kill your wife. It was you? Because of me and Mark? It was over. It'd been over for a year. I hadn't even talked to him. I know. Then why now? We-we were better This whole last year, we've been better. It's the money. If he'd done this last year, You don't finish the train- no bonus. This way, he gets the money. You were wrong. Maybe I did deserve what was coming to me. I'm responsible for this. You risked your life for me and I lied to you about who I was. Everybody does that. I don't care what anybody says. Sometimes it's a lot easier. You did something you regret. We're hardwired to do things we regret. It ain't gonna change. There's nothing to be afraid of. And it's certainly not a reason to die. I don't even know what I owe you. Can you at least tell me your name? Christopher Chance. Is that true? And don't you dare count it. See ya, Chance. Well, I told him his services were no longer needed. Why is that funny? Oh, he'll be back. Oh. Hey, listen, um... what do you say you take some time off now. What are you worried about? What's so different about now than anything else I've ever done? And don't get started about how you think I'm losing it because you sound like an idiot. Well, fine. I did think that at first, that you were loosing focus. I haven't lost focus. No, I-I believe you. I do. And now I'm really worried. I ask myself "why would he just continue to do this- "just put himself in situations where he ends up in front of "one loaded gun after another? "what is it? Is it the rush or some kind of weird penance?" And then it hit me. Maybe he keeps putting himself in front of that loaded gun because deep down, he hopes that one of these days he'll get what he really deserves and the gun will finally go off. Go ahead. Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me you're planning on being around for awhile. What the hell are they doing? I don't know. Open up that bag right there. Whiskey? It's not whiskey. Really? 'cause it looks like a bottle of Japanese whiskey to me. I hired you to protect me from those people. And your plan is to have a smoke and a drink? You know, there was a day I would've felt bad opening up a bottle like this. But I'm learning to live in the now. I mean, it might taste better in ten years, it might be worth more. But what if I'm not around to find out? What the hell are you doing? Ah. You're really missing something here. Smooth. Good finish. You'd never even know this stuff burns like jet fuel. Man, you crazy? Let's find out. Sync, corrected by elderman - for addic7ed. com - Good day, Mr. Finley. Good day, Ms. Miller. Well... Rooster! You out, boy? Got him, Mr. Finley. - Morning, Mrs. Baker. - Morning. Hello, Mr. Perryfield. I am sorry I'm a little late. It's about time. I was about to go inside. There's a storm coming, and my hip's killing me. I'm sorry to hear that, sir. Now, you don't think I'm gonna sit around all day waiting for you when the cold comes, do you? No, sir. Be careful with that top step there. It gives a little. Here goes. Uhh. Ah. Yuck! Blech! And good morning to you! Good morning, Mr. Finley! Good morning, Sheila. Beautiful day, isn't it? - Sure is. - How's Jimmy? - He's doing real good. - Good. You take care now, huh? All right. You, too. Les? About this Brady McDaniels, he's already missed several days this month. I can't keep covering. Hey, Mr. Mullins, go look up the word "fragile". Uh, "Les"? When did I become "Les"? Sorry, uh, Lester... Mr. Stevens. Boss, the guy's a screw-up. It's like he's asking to get canned. How many days this month? Hey, Cathy. Congratulations, girl. Thanks, Mr. S. - Four. - Four? That's not so bad. It's only the 12th. Look, Carl... I just think there's something there worth saving. I thought you were gone already. I need someone good, Lester. This has been my route for ten years. I've been voted Best Postal Carrier seven years and counting. I know, Walter, but it's slim pickings right now. What about that new kid Trevor? Oh, he's slow as mud through a straw. - Kay. - Kay's got a month left on maternity leave. And before you ask, Pete just got his knee scoped. Look, Walter, it's your time now. You've always wanted an extended leave. You've earned it. Go, enjoy. I'll find the right fit. Promise. Okay. But there are a few things you should know. 237, the old man... Cornelius Perryfield... checks the box every day at the same time. Good-bye, Walter. It's one trip out, and if the mail's not there, he'll call and complain. And the Bakers' dog, 231, he'll take a chunk out of you if you don't... Go now. All right. One more thing. Oh, Lord have mercy. Take a look at these. 244 Laurel Lane. Can't just shred 'em, but they keep coming. It's like... finding a kitten on your back porch. You can't just walk away. I'll take care of them, Walter. Go on home. I'm staying in town, so call me if you need anything. Get a life, Finley! No. Get a wife. Oh. Ah! Ooh! No, no, no, no. Ah-huh. Ohh, no. No, no, no. Oh, another gourmet dish? Yeah, something like that, Mom. Ohh. Ohh. Honey, nobody expects you to be Supermom. Yeah, well, lucky for that. Gosh, I just wanted to make a nice meal for my kids before I went back to work, and I... Sweetheart, you've got enough on your plate. - Here, let me have these. Come on. - Ohh. Mom, listen, I really appreciate you dropping everything to come here, but it's not fair to put it all on you. I... Yeah, my schedule was so busy! Tea with the Queen and all. Honey, that's what moms are for. Maddy, you need this job. I'll tell you when it gets to be too much. Hot! Hot, Mom! That's hot! I'm sorry! Sorry, sorry. Ah! I gotta go. Thank you! I love you! Right back at you. Honey, was that meatloaf? I'm busy. Come back later. Busy, huh? Have you finished your homework? It's not due till Friday. What's your excuse gonna be on Thursday? I don't know. I'll think of something. Nobody likes a smart aleck, Ben. And your room is a wreck. Clean it, please. Oh, and stay home while I'm gone so Granna doesn't have to worry. Sure thing, Mom. Like I'm gonna ride my bicycle around town and just tear it up. Bed before 11:00. Help Granna and check in on your brother, all right? Okay. Good. Aw, dude, he lost it. Okay, Jimmy's got it. Jimmy's got it. Oh, man, he lost it to them. Okay, he's stolen it back. Yes! Yes! Hey, Tybo. Wait, wait. I'm just about to... and score! Okay. Sometimes I think that gorgeous smile of yours is about the only thing that keeps me going. You tired? A little. - Stomach? - Good to go. - That's my boy. How about your... - Mom. I'm good. Okay, okay. I gotta go. Mwah. Listen, you can call me any time. You know. - Yeah, I know. - Granna will help with the meds, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Uhh! Do you even know how much I love you? I love you... this much. - That isn't very much. - Oh, but it is. Because my love for you starts here and goes all the way around the world, and it ends up right back here. Ohh! Whoa? What's this? That's how much I love you. Mmm! Anyway... Granna's doing something for dinner. I sort of... messed it up. Really? You? Yeah. Stop it. I'm not that hungry anyways. Oh, sweetie. Please try to eat something. Okay. I just don't like to get sick when you're not home. I know. I gotta go. Mwah. I love you. I'll see you in the morning. - I'll be here. - Okay. Computers. That's the third time I've had to reboot this thing. Heh-heh. Mm-hm. Hello, gals. Well, looky here! Finally! - Hey, girl. - Hi. Glad to have you back. Sure is an improvement over some folk. That's funny. Just what I was thinking. Well, I can see things haven't changed around here. How's Tyler? He's good. Yeah. You know, as good as a little boy can be after having brain surgery and 30 treatments of radiation. But he's home. For now. So... So, what does the doctor say? The same. "Medulloblastoma is a rare and aggressive brain cancer. "Don't get your hopes up." Yeah, like I can control that. But you know what? The good news is, my mom is staying for a while until things settle down. - Oh, that's great. - Yeah. Can you give me a report on my patients, please? Yeah, let me... Okay, so, Mrs. Riley is in 406. That little boy Matthew is in 402. And Mr. Samuels is back again in 410. Great. - Uh, Granna? - Mm-hm? You sure you're okay with doing this? Oh, piece of cake. Your mom taught me how to do it. Um, are you sure you know how to do this, Granna? Cool it. You're making me nervous. Tyler! Mom's on the phone! He's up here and he's busy! Now slow. Make sure you don't get an air bubble in my heart. Yes, sir. - Tyler? What's wrong? - Tyler, Mom wants to talk to you. - Aaaaah! - Tyler! - Oh! - Tyler! Aah! Tyler! - Aaaah! - Tyler! Oh, for heaven's sake! That's really not funny. You're a jerk, man. Ben! - I'm sorry, Granna. - Silly. - Mom! - Maddy? Mom, is Tyler okay? Everything's fine. Everything's okay. - You don't have to come home. - Mom, everything's fine here. Just stay at work. Right. Oh, fool me once. Oh, Maddy, I've got to call you back. Okay. Call me back. Hey. Is he okay? Yeah, he's okay. Are you okay? No. This whole thing stinks. Well, I get that. When I'm struggling with something, it really helps me to pray about it. Pray? Yeah. What are we supposed to pray for, exactly? Dear God... don't take Tyler. You have Dad. Isn't that enough? Oh, Ben. Prayer is just telling God what's in your heart and asking Him to help you with it. Well, maybe I don't want to tell God what's in my heart. I'm afraid to ask God to help Tyler. I mean, what if He doesn't? No, I can't. Come on. Come on. Dear Heavenly Father... "Dear God... "how many people are in heaven? "Must be a lot. "I know two, and I'm only eight." We are struggling, Lord. We're scared, and we need your guidance. "I learned a new word today. "Medu... lloblastoma... or something. "My mom says I'll be sick for a while, "but it'll be okay." "Why am I sick, God? "The medicine stinks. "But I don't have to take my spelling test this week, "so that's good." "Can you see the stars from heaven? "My dad said You made them all. "I'm really glad to be home from the hospital. "But most of all, "I really just wish my mom would laugh. "I miss that the most." In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Do I have to fill out a form or something? Spoken like a true government worker. Yeah. So, you're having trouble quieting those demons tonight? You having trouble remembering you're just the bartender? McDaniels, if you keep pushing people away... Save it. You're not my C.O. Anymore. Ohh. Uhh. All right. Oh, and, Jack... Jimmy Buffett called. He wants his shirt back.

My grandpa told me you were back. My mom wouldn't let me come over till later. I figured this was later. Are you better? I'm working on it. Let me look at you. Hmm. You don't look so bad. I'm much better. I think I'm going back to school even. Oh! Thank goodness. If I have to eat lunch one more day with Ashley Turner, I'll just die! I mean, it's horrible. She smells like liverwurst. Ugh! Well, here. I got you this. Sweet! Thanks. Ben, get up! Quick! My mom's coming. Hey, Tybo, you're awake. Yep, I'm awake. Just sitting here... being awake. Oh. Is that a new hat? - You mean this thing? - Mm-hm. Mom. So, uh... So, I'm going back to school today. Right? You think you're up to it? - I think so. - I don't know. What do you think, Sam? I think he's ready. - Way to be stealth, Sam! - Hi, Miss Maddy. - Hi, sweetheart. How are you? - I'm fine. - My grandpa told me Tyler was back. - How is your grandpa? - He's good. - Good. And grumpy. Okay. Good and grumpy, then. If you're going to school, you ought to start getting ready. - Yes! - Yes! Ah-ah-ah! Front door, please. Sure, Miss Maddy. Thank you, young lady. See you on the bus, Ty. Oh, no. I've got to check him in, so he'll see you there later. Scoot! Oh, come on. A walking route? I need a suitable scalp. And to find it, Dr. frankenheim figures out some skull attributes he wants to emulate. That's moving about the same as the skin over my skull. *** through it, 2.43 pounds. This is sort of fibrous. Next, he finds is artificial materials with those attributes. The veinal epidermus, absorbent subcutaneous layers and of course, blood. It all comes together into disturbingly accurate analog of human skin. The epidermis goes on it like so and when I cut it, with any luck, it's going to bleed. And with that -- there you go. Our fake skin meat head is ready to take one for the team. Let the lacerations begin. In the laceration test, with the full bear bottle, three, two -- nasty. One -- there's definitely some cuts there. Yep. It bleeds. Nasty. Nasty and if it was needed, a further graphic illustration of how dangerous it is to use a bottle as a weapon. Just put the other one there and the other there. That's our full bottle compared to the empty one. Okay. Okay, here we go. Laceration test, empty beer bottle into our meat Buster. Three, two, one-- a successful smash and as with the full bottle, it's immediately obvious damage was done. I like my fake skin. It's a nice fake skin. And an up-close comparison sees little difference in the damage to that skin between the two tests. I don't know about you, but I look at these and they look pretty much equivalent to me. You know, give or take a neck or two, it's the same. Yeah. The original myth is that having an empty bottle broken over your head is worse for you than a full bottle? From our testing, it's not true. You get a much worse concussion from a full bottle than empty one. And also, from our testing, on bones, the full bottle is also worse. It's more likely to cause a skull fracture. Now, the skin laceration test, actually, for the first time, they're about even. But that still doesn't make the statement that the empty bottle is supportable. So, still not looking very good. I'd almost say it's busted. Okay. The myth that it's worse to have an empty bottle over a full bottle, let's recap from the standpoint of your brain? Busted. From the standpoint of your skull bone, also busted. From the standpoint of your skin, no difference. -That leaves this myth. - Busted. Totally busted. Kari, Grant and Tory are about to find out if leather can be a lethal cannon. This is our target. We have a barrier of milk pack by triangulation of three water barrels. Why milk? Because it's going look really cool on high speed when your cannon ball crashes into it. And speaking of high speed, with the aid of the high speed and this scale here, we're going to be able to catch the velocity of the ball and see if it matches our parrot gun. And here, we have a designer-inspired ultimately completely reinforced 100% genuine leather cannon. If only the Irish had something this stylish. The siege of *** castle, well, who knows if the cannon would have exploded but, at least they'd be... Fighting in style. However, it's not style, but performance substance that ultimately matters. Remember, the benchmark we're using is the parrot rifles muzzle velocity of 389 miles per hour, plus, it has to be capable of multiple, successful firing. Oh, man, this is the prettiest cannon I've ever seen. Kari has described her cannon as a purse. All it needs now is that favorite, slippery solution. I saw that on dirty jobs once. Really? - Yeah. Except it was a cow, right? Yeah, whatever. Don't worry, Betsy. So, why we lubing up our barrel? Well... The last time we tried the Irish leather cannon, built to historical specifications, the cannon had a hard time of getting out of the barrel, *** delaminate the inner most layer. We don't want that to happen this time. So we're adding lube and hopefully, it will go shooting right out the end. You in? Yep. That's it. Let's do it. I think we have a very good chance. 80% at at least. 20% if it explodes. So, it's time to find out if the bling leather cannon can. Here we go, designer-inspired cannon, three, two, one we did it! We made a leather cannon! Is reaction says it all. We've made a leather cannon and it worked. The test looks to be a success, but up close, the evidence begins to contradict their initial reaction. Punched through the carton, no problem. Unlike the parrot rifle, which easily punched through two water barrels, the leather cannon only just pierced the milk carton. You're going to give somebody a bruise with that. The assessment is backed up from the numbers. I've got 52.5 miles per hour. You could drive faster than that. But it was entirely made out of the leather. I think that's awesome. That's right. It is awesome. The less than lethal velocity was caused by what is the final nail in the leather cannon coffin. Deformation of the combustion chamber and that can only mean one thing. It looked like it was going to be plausible, but you can only get one shot out of it, I think this one's busted. Busted. But man, what a way to go out. Looking cool. At least we got one good shot out of it. leather, it's good for not good for artilery. Remember, do not try anything you are about to see at home. Ugh! On this episode of "Mythbusters"... Adam and Jamie get feisty with a bar-fight fable. What's the matter, old man? Been too long since your last bar fight? ...they want to know if an empty beer bottle really does more damage than a full one. God, that is nasty! Meanwhile... You have to massage the leather. Makes a better cannon. ...in a ballistic-material mystery from history... Fire! Is this where the legs were? ...Kari, Grant, and Tory take on the tall tale of the Swedish and Irish cannons... Whoo-hoo! Let's go to battle! ...made from leather. Who are the Mythbusters? Adam Savage Here comes chaos! ... Bye-bye! ...and Jamie Hyneman. I call it my little pop gun. Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience. Joining them... Kari Byron... Explosives and electricity. Whoo! ...Tory Belleci... This is your big chance. ...and Grant Imahara. Now for something completely gratuitous. They don't just tell the myths. They put them to the test. We're not gonna have to start drinking in the middle of the day again, are we? Luckily, no. This is not a myth about getting drunk. It's a myth about what happens after you've already gotten drunk and gotten yourself into a bar fight. And the myth is that getting hit with an empty bottle is worse for you than getting hit with a bottle that's full. Allow me to demonstrate. No silver-screen bar-fight scene is complete without one. However, unlike the movies, in real life, a bottle bash is extremely dangerous. How dangerous? Well, award-winning forensic scientists list skull fractures concussions, and scalp lacerations among the possible injuries. They also conclude that an empty-bottle smash will do more damage. But is this really possible? Could a lighter, empty bottle really harm you more than a heavier, full one? So, how do you want to test this one? Fake bottle. Don't do this at home. No, seriously, how are you thinking we should test this? Exactly like that, but with real bottles. Except with head protection. We'll have a closer look at what kind of forces are involved. Okay. So, let the bar fight commence. Even though after a few beers it might seem like a good idea to hit somebody over the head with a beer bottle, it's probably not. Nevertheless, we feel inclined to get up close and personal in our testing. And that's where this comes in. This is a football helmet outfitted with a specially designed array of accelerometers that will register any movement of our skull and help us determine whether a full versus an empty beer bottle is more harmful. Plus it's a nice excuse for me to hit Adam over the head with a bottle, which I regularly want to do. You ready? You know, before I put this on and take some hits to the head, let's put this on a non-human analogue just to make sure it's safe, see what kind of forces are involved. ... Okay. He's ready. I'm ready. We're ready. Okay. Safety-systems check. Wow. Uh, that's not what happens in the movies. Now, it seems like these are a lot harder to break than we thought. And I think that's because of a couple of main reasons. What's the matter, old man? Been too long since your last bar fight? One is, in the movies, you're always seeing people smack each other over the head with bottles, and the bottles break fairly easily. Well, those are fake bottles. It's the movies. And, number two, who among us hasn't dropped and broken bottles? They seem quite fragile. But the fact is they're not. They're actually built to ship. They're built to last. And when you look at shots like this... This... and this... It's pretty clear these things are tougher than they look. Adam, however, is as tough as he looks Ow, ow. ... not very. So, when our expert crunches the numbers... That was about 107 G's. ...the experiment takes a safer turn. And about 100 G's is the average concussion that we see in the field. I don't think I'm gonna be wearing that helmet today. I don't blame you. The helmet, doing what it was designed to do, was flexing on impact, absorbing energy and making it difficult to break the bottle. Cue our hard-headed head stunt man with his crown of data- collecting accelerometers. Huh. Well, there you go. Did you get a reading? Yeah, it's about 54 G's. Awesome! Awesome. But one data point does not a sample make. So, in a frenzy of beer and broken glass... 33. ...Hard Man Hyneman smashes away... 11 G's. ...until he's satisfied with a sample set of seven... 34. ...which yields an average of 28 G's. Awesome! Let's continue with an empty bottle. Remember, the myth is that an empty bottle, when smashed, is more damaging than the full. Are you peeing? No. ... Okay. It's the comparison that's the key. Okay, here we go. Empty beer bottle. And as the numbers come in, it's clear that comparison does not favor the myth. 13 G's. So, it's about 11 G's. Less G's-force to the head from the empties appears to indicate they do less damage than the full ones, but Adam's got an issue with the experimental design. In general, the data seems to support the idea that it's not looking very good for the myth, but we're seeing huge variances in the "G's" load on this guy, depending on how hard Jamie swings, which is very hard to control. Clearly, moving forward, we're gonna need to remove the variance of the human arm and go with a mechanical solution to solving this problem. All right, Kari, what do these things have in common? Okay, creamer, cheese, leather chicken, duct tape, and a steel pipe? Saturday night at Adam Savage's house? Very close. No. Saturday night at Jamie Hyneman's house? No. Cannon. Okay, I get everything but the leather. Well, that's the next myth... we are gonna try to build a cannon out of nothing but leather. ...O-kay. Really? ... Absolutely. In the 17 th century, King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden came up with the idea. It was a copper core with iron bands reinforcing it, mastic fabric, and, finally, the entire thing was wrapped in leather. That's not a leather cannon. That's a cannon covered in leather. But wait. There's more. Later that century at the siege of Ballygally Castle, Irish troops actually built a cannon using nothing but leather. It was about 5 feet long and about 5 inches thick. Leather cannon. I like it. The Mythbusters and cannons have a long and explosive history. Ho ho ho! I think we killed Captain Kirk! There was a cheese-firing cannon... A cannon made from duct tape... And, not to mention, the famous cannon that fired chicken. So, who better to get to the bottom of this mystery of history? Did the Swedes and Irish really make a viable and effective cannon from cow skin? So, my leather man, what's the plan? Well, we definitely need to build both versions, Swedish and Irish, but before we do that, I think we need a benchmark. ... What do you mean? Well, we've built proven concept cannons before, like the duct-tape cannon, but those weren't weapons of war. I mean, we need something that can compete on the battlefield. So, we need to compare it to a cast-iron period cannon. Exactly... we'll find out how much black powder they used and how fast the projectiles come out. Yeah, and then, on those specs, we'll be able to judge how well our two cannons are doing. I like it. So, first up, it's down to the bomb range to get the lowdown on period-accurate hardware from period-accurate experts. Wow! - This is Bonnie Blue. The Confederates tended to name their cannon. Yeah, we have a tendency to do that, too. Let's get her off the truck and fire it up! We're at the Alameda County bomb range, where we're about to fire off a Civil War period cannon known as the parrot gun. Yeah. That looks good. Now, the myth that we're working on says that the Irish and the Swedish created a leather cannon. Now, this cannon's appro ximately the same size and fires appro ximately the same-size ammunition as the leather cannons. You know it's go time when Grant's got his game face on. It's go time! So, we're going to fire this off, check the muzzle velocity, and use that as a yardstick against the ones that we want to build. Look at that. Perfect. If this doesn't stop a cannonball, I don't know what will. How about a stack of Union soldiers? Meanwhile, Grant is getting set up to measure what old Bonnie Blue can do. As you know, on our show we love to use the high-speed camera, 'cause it gives us all these juicy, gorgeous shots of things that happen in a blink of an eye. But today it's going to be a scientific tool. Come on. Let me show you. So, we've aimed the high-speed camera at this scale, which is set up next to the cannon. It has one-foot increments. Given a known frame rate, we can count how many frames it takes for a cannonball to cross one of the increments. And that would give us the cannonball's speed, which will form the benchmark for how well our Swedish and Irish cannons perform. Hit it! Okay. Let's talk black powder. Firing off the cheese cannon... maybe this much black powder. Clear. Duct-tape cannon... maybe this much. ...Go ahead. ... Hit it. And when we blew off Buster's leg, maybe that much. ...Good? ... Hit it. This is 6 ounces of black powder. That is what we'll be firing in our parrot gun. Gun is loaded. All right. Muzzle velocity test. On your go! 3... 2... 1... clear. ...Ohh! ... Ohh! Yeah! Good shot! That thing split it! Look at that! ...Ohh! Bull's-eye! ... It is! Nice shot! So, the whole point of today's experiment was not problem of the American. -Always running. -Please, Mamma. I have to meet my fiance. Fiance? {ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY} {BOTH CONGRATULATING IN ITALIAN} At Least take some dessert for you and your fiance. {SPEAKS ITALIAN} Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know, 1 20 kilometres each way and I'm still beating you? -Congratulations. -What? Yeah. What? I mean, how was Verona? How was it without me? Empty? Half-empty? Completely empty? Half-empty. -I met the Secretaries of Juliet. -Juliet? -Like Juliet Capulet? -Yeah. There are these women that call themselves the Secretaries of Juliet, and they write Letters to people that write Letters to Juliet. And then these secretaries, they work for the city of Verona, and, Like, all these people, these broken hearted women all over the world, come and they write Letters -and Leave them on the wall. -What's in the bag? I don't know. So, they post these Letters. They post them on the wall in Juliet's courtyard, and then these secretaries come back with this basket and they retrieve the Letters every day. And then they write back, as Juliet, to all the Letters that have return addresses on them. Mmm-hmm. This is their job. I mean, it's so unbelievable. This is their passion. It's what they do every day. Mmm. Mmm. -They Literally will work all day, every day. -Mmm! Oh, my God! -And they've been doing it for years. -Sophie. Wow. This is incredible! And they... This is incredible. This is incredible. Oh, my God. This is great. Try this, try this. You have to try this. Oh, my God. No... Give it a good bite. Come on. {VICTOR SPEAKING EXCITEDLY IN ITALIAN} Your Victor is very passionate. Yes, yes, I know. But he seems to think that he's Italian since we got here. And although imitation is, of course, the highest form of flattery, his imitations are not very good. Okay, that woman is amazing. I mean, she's incredible. She's incredible. I think I'm in Love. -Absolutely. -You're in Love with her? -Yeah. Yeah. -Really? Okay. Just say no. Just say no, and I won't do it, really. I mean, I'm dying to do it, but I won't. Okay. What? Angelina's offered to teach me some secrets today. -Okay. -Yeah. Okay, right now and all day? Like, right now. That's crazy, right? I mean, now. That's amazing. I mean, she's making risotto all'Amarone, right? Yeah? -Good risotto. -You see? You see, it's, Like, 300 years old or something, her recipe. It's fantastic. Okay. That's great. But... So, no Lake Garda then today? Oh, yeah. Lake Garda... I mean, Lake Garda's been there for, Like, 500,000 years, you know. And right now, Angelina's offered to help me. And, you know, I mean, I'm here, we're here, you know. -We're having a good time. -You, Paul Newman, you want to work, you have to watch! You see? I mean, you see, I became Paul Newman. AII right? Okay, what shall I do? I mean, my hands are tied. I don't know. I don't know. You could help us if you Like. -Yeah! Yeah. The Letter thing, right? -ISABELLA: Why not? Yeah, yeah, you write the Letters and I'II cook. And Later we eat and... Win-win. ISABELLA: How Long have you and Victor been engaged? SOPHIE: Almost a year. Wow. And may I ask why don't you wear an engagement ring? Yeah, see, that's... That's me. I insisted. He was so busy, you know, this whole restaurant and everything. And I guess I felt it unnecessary. Still, a girl should have a ring. SOPHIE: "I didn't go to him, Juliet. "I didn't go to Lorenzo. "His eyes were so full of trust. "I promised I'd meet him to run away together "because my parents don't approve. "But instead, I Left him waiting for me, below our tree, "waiting and wondering where I was. "I'm in Verona now. "I return to London in the morning, and I'm so afraid. "Please, Juliet, tell me what I should do. "My heart is breaking, and I have no one else to turn to. "Love, Claire." And it's been there for all those years? I think she came back to find her one true Love. And they had 10 children and still make passionate Love every night. Except he got bald and fat and she has to do all the work. -Francesca. -Francesca. And maybe she stayed in London and married a duke and lived happily ever after, just Like me. -But you married an accountant, not a duke. -Nobody's perfect. And I bet when she's making Love to that duke... -Yeah? -...she's imagining her first Love, Lorenzo. Isabella, I have to write back. Then answer her. {SAYING GOOD NIGHT IN ITALIAN} Good night, friends. {SAYING GOOD NIGHT IN ITALIAN} Good night. Hey. VICTOR: Hey. -Sorry I'm late. -No, it's fine. No worries. -How was your day? Good? -It was... -It was so good. -Yeah? -Yeah. -Good. I'm glad. How was Angelina? Yeah, it was good. I mean, she's amazing, you know. That woman is incredible. She's very instinctive, you know. She cooks without recipes. I mean, she's incredible. -She's invited me to cook again. -Really? Yeah. Yeah, I think I can learn a Iot from her. But... No, no, you first, you first. Sorry, sorry. -No, just real quick. I just... -Mmm-hmm? I had the most amazing day. I got to answer a Letter that was written 50 years ago. I know it might not get there, but it just feels so good to write. Yeah, I think you should spend more time with them. -Why? -Because it's your passion, right? And also because it fits perfectly. Because I just got off the phone with Signor Morini, and he's invited me to this amazing wine auction that's happening in Livorno. -In Livorno? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's super-exclusive. I mean, I don't know... I don't know if I can get a ticket, you know. I mean, I'II be off, Like, a day or two, max. If you want, I'II try to get two tickets, -but I'm not sure I can get two tickets. -Yeah. To a wine auction? In Livorno? Yeah, it sounds terrible. I know. I'm sorry. I'm so... I feel terrible now. I feel terrible. I mean, it's... I miss you already, you know. -I'II be back very soon. Okay? -Yeah. Be careful. Bye! Ciao. FRANCESCA: Listen to what this poor girl writes. "Juliet, is there anything worse in this world than a man?" {SPEAKING ITALIAN} {ALL LAUGHING} {KNOCKING ON DOOR} Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt, but are you the Secretaries of Juliet? -Yes, that's us. -Great. May I ask, which one of you wrote this Letter to my grandmother, Claire Smith? I wrote that. And I can't believe that it found you. Yes. We Brits tend to stay in our family homes. Yeah. This is amazing. It's Less than a week since I mailed it. It was a very thoughtful Letter. Now, what were you thinking? I was thinking that she deserved an answer. Yeah, 50 years ago, maybe. Not now. I'm sorry. I didn't know true Love had an expiration date. True Love? Are you joking? Could you imagine what would've happened if she hadn't seen sense? Well, yeah, you wouldn't be here, and that would be an upside. What are you doing here anyway? What, are you some Lonely American girl who has to Live vicariously through others? I'm not Lonely. I am engaged. My condolences to the groom. Excuse me! So that's it? You've come all the way from London to give me a Lecture? No, I came because I couldn't Let my grandmother come on her own. Claire is here? Why? I think even you might be able to work that one out. Oh, my God! That's awesome! She's come to find her Lorenzo! Awesome? And if Lorenzo doesn't want to see her, has forgotten her, is gravely ill or dead, Let's say, just for fun, then what? Thought so. I want to meet her. I'd Like to meet Claire. And I want to play for Manchester United, but I'm shit at football. You don't think that she wants to meet me? I honestly think she has no interest meeting a woman that can manage to jam, "Oh, my God" and "awesome" into the same sentence. Gran, they're closing up. We should go now. Excuse me. Claire? Hi. Hi. My name is Sophie, and I wrote you the Letter. Letter? From Juliet? Goodness! Thank you. Thank you. But however did you find us? -Well, your grandson found me, actually. -You did? Right, well, the thing is, -I thought we should... -Yeah, well, he's very sweet and very charming, and he thought that you might Like to meet me. Uncharacteristically thoughtful of you, dear. Yes, well, under the circumstances, it seems a Little churlish not to meet the woman responsible -for this voyage of Lunacy. -Okay. Charlie doesn't approve, which makes this all the more fun. {WOMEN LAUGHING} We were just going for a glass of wine. Would you Like to join us? Absolutely not. -What? -Absolutely not. It's been a Long day. It's too Long a day. -Okay, darling. Have a good sleep. -But I... Do you know somewhere we could go? I actually have the perfect place. SOPHIE: I can't believe you're really here. I was taking an art course in Tuscany, staying with a family outside Siena, and they had a son Lorenzo, and it was Love at first sight. He had such gentle blue eyes. And he told me I was very beautiful. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} {SPEAKING ITALIAN} And he gave me this ring. We wanted to get married, but I'd got exams back in England and my parents would never have agreed, and I got scared, and I ran away. Now what I really want is to tell him that I'm so sorry I was such a coward. Of course, a card or Letter is just too simple. So, you've come to find your Lorenzo? Yes, and I think I know where he is. Where? On the farm, just near Siena. Charlie's driving me down tomorrow. Only because I didn't want you to hitchhike. Well, he thinks it's a big mistake. Because you don't have a romantic bone in your body. No, no. It's because I am a realist. No. Because you are an Englishman! Cold as fish! Right. And who was it that wrote Romeo and Juliet? William Shakespearelli, a great Italian. They're mad. They're mad. {BELL TOLLING} CLAIRE: Sophie, my dear. Good night. Thank you so much. Thank you. Good night. Good night, everybody. -Good night. -Charlie, Let's go. -CHARLIE: Good night, Ladies. Ciao. -Good Luck. -Bye. -Ciao. How wonderful would it be if she found her Romeo? {BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN} Imagine if she did, 50 years Later, all because you found that Letter. Nobody would believe it if it weren't true, you know. {BOTH CHATTERING} Wait! Wait! -Oh, for... Here she comes. -Sorry. -May I come with you to find Lorenzo? -Come with us? What about this fiance of yours? You're in the city of Love and you want to come with us? Yes, I do. Because he's busy and I'm free. And I mean... -Of course, if it's not an intrusion. -No, no, it's not an intrusion. I just... Listen, -I do have one thing to tell you first. -It's not an intrusion. This is not entirely selfless. It started out as a simple reply to your Letter, and now I think it's so amazing what you're doing, -and I'd Love to write about it if it's okay. -CHARLIE: A journalist. Gran, a journalist trying to pry into our private lives. Charlie, come on. It's hardly state secrets, is it? I'm not a journalist. I would Like to be some day, but... And you think Gran's story is your ticket? I think it's a story worth telling. I'd Love to have you with us. -Really? -Yes. Of course. We would. SOPHIE: How much time did you actually spend with Lorenzo? CLAIRE: Every second that we could. I'd go to meet him after class, to the farm where he was working, and we'd sit under the trees and we'd share some bread with tomatoes and olive oil. -It's so romantic. -Yeah. What's so romantic about eating in the dirt? Really? CLAIRE: The dirt. Well, you see, he Loved the earth. He Loved talking to me about the rain and the springs of fresh water, and we'd walk for miles and miles. We'd lie in the dry grass. I can still remember the smell of his sweet, hot sweat and... Okay. Okay, Gran. We get the picture. So you must feel Like you're about to find your Iong-Iost soul mate. Yes. Her soul mate was my grandfather. Let's not invalidate my entire existence. Okay, I'm sorry, I just... That's clearly not what I meant. Charlie's just Like my husband. Both sceptics. My husband always insisted that Love was nothing but hormones. But you see, underneath, he had such a warm, passionate heart. And Charlie's just the same. Tell me about the guy you're in Love with. Victor. Yeah. -Well, Victor is a chef, an amazing chef. -Wow. Yeah. He's opening his own restaurant in New York. And that's the reason we're here. We're meeting suppliers all around. And he's actually... He's in Livorno at a wine auction as we speak. That sounds fun. For him. Yeah. Well, and do your parents Like him? Yeah, my dad. My dad Likes him. My mom Left us when I was nine. Oh, dear. -Oh, dear. I'm sorry about that. -That's okay. It was a really Long time ago. Slowly, slowly. How do you want to go about this? Ring the doorbell. What if the wife answers and goes into a fit of jealous rage? Gran? Well, I'd be flattered. I'm more worried that he won't remember me. Right. Let's go home then, Gran, before this all ends in tears. Come on. There's no one in. I'm goanna check the back. There's no... We made our best effort. There's no need to prolong the disappointment. {GREETS IN ITALIAN} {SPEAKING ITALIAN} It's me, yeah. Good afternoon. I'm Charlie Wyman. This is my grandmother, Claire, -and Sophie. -Ciao. I'm Claire. Do you remember? Claire. It's not him. Are you sure? It's not his eyes. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} Let's make sure. Do you remember what you were doing in the summer of 1957? The summer of 1957, I will never forget, I met the most beautiful girl with Long, blonde hair. Nana! We married that year. -I curse that woman! -CLAIRE: What? -Oh, no! -Right. I curse her eyes! I curse her teeth! I curse her moustache! But why are you asking? Why you bring up such a horrible memory? {WOMEN LAUGHING} CHARLIE: Well, that went well. Can't say we didn't try, Nana. I'm sorry. Truly. Are you for real? If I actually knew what that question meant, I might attempt to answer it. He can't be the only Lorenzo Bartolini in Tuscany. Well, he's the only one around here, so... I haven't flown all the way here to pack it in now. Nana, what do you want to do? You want to start knocking on every door asking if Lorenzo's in? I mean... How many can there be? CHARLIE: Seventy-four? Seventy-four Lorenzo Bartolinis and you want to go on a scavenger hunt? Impossible. We're going home in the morning. Come on, Charlie, will you calm down? Sophie, what do you think? Gran, what do you mean, what does she think? She doesn't think. This was her brilliant idea. It's over! Done! We found Nemo. The curtains have closed. {SPEAKING LATIN} -Sophie. -Listen, this is my job. I find things. And through process of elimination and caveat emptor, which will require assembling a few more facts, we can narrow this down considerably. Did Ms. Awesome For Real just use caveat emptor? Oh, please, all right. I went to Brown. Double Major. Minor in Latin. This is madness. It's madness. Charlie, didn't you say you wanted to go and swim? -We are working. Go away. -This is utter, complete mad... Work! CHARLIE: I can't believe it. Ridiculous. CLAIRE: He's a good-Looking sort. Isn't he? AII right. Are you sure that Lorenzo would never have Left this area? He Loved this Land. I'm quite certain. May I? Our Lorenzo's. Are you sure that you have time for all this? {AUCTIONING IN ITALIAN} {CELL PHONE RINGING} Ciao. How are you? I'm good. How are you? You know what? I was just witnessing this most incredible, incredible Sauterne auction. It was just beautiful. It was incredible. How's it going? I'm good. I'm in Siena right now. What? In Siena? -What are you doing in Siena? -I'm writing a story. We're kind of on a bit of an adventure, Looking for somebody that she used to know 50 years ago. You know what, baby? You know what? I mean, this isn't a good time because I'm in the middle of something, but, I mean, I'm glad you called because I was actually just goanna call you right now. You know, the opportunities here are really, really, really incredible, you know, and I think I'm goanna have to stay till Friday. Can I stay or should I skip it? I mean, I feel horrible, but... No, do it. Please. I'm goanna need until Friday, as well. Great. So Friday, all right? Friday. Friday's good. Okay. Win-win. {BIDDING FAREWELL IN ITALIAN} Claire? I'm free. -Free for what? Free for what? -She's coming. -She's coming with us. - She's coming? Splendid. CHARLIE: That's splendid! Fantastic! {BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN} -Okay? -Okay. Good Luck. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} It's not him. CLAIRE: Oh, my God. No! CHARLIE: Well, wouldn't this be nice, Gran? Going from a boy who works the fields to a man who owns them. And you got to skip the messy bits. Life is the messy bits. Peccato it wasn't me. Yes. I would have never Let you go. Believe me. {BOTH BIDDING FAREWELL IN ITALIAN} SOPHIE: What is it with you and Italian men? They fall at your feet. It's such a shame. I think I could've been happy here. Happy? Did your grandson just say happy? I said could have been. Let's not get carried away. I have a reputation to uphold. CLAIRE: Charlie, why don't you tell Sophie about your pro bono Legal work? I can't imagine she'd have much interest, Gran. -Try me. -You know the sort of thing, defending the defenceless, preserving human rights, helping refugees get asylum. -You Look surprised. -I'm so surprised. I just didn't have you pinned down as the save-humanity type at all. CHARLIE: Really? And what type did you have me pinned down for exactly? Well, I was Leaning towards elitist Oxford prig, but now that you mention it, self-satisfied do-gooder works, as well. I guess you're a poor judge of character then. But she does deal with facts, Charlie. Okay. -I'm off to bed. -Okay. -Good night, darling. -Good night. Sleep well. -May I walk you to your room? -Be nice to each other. She is awesome. I respect your usage of the word this one instance. Oh, I'm flattered. Thank you for approving. You're very welcome. Right. Well. Should we hit the sack? Sorry. I guess I... Well, as much as I'd Love to sit here and drink the whole bottle of Caparzo... No, go to bed. You should. Good night, Charlie. Right. -Well, good night. -Good night. Forgive me. Where are my manners? You know, I've been wondering that since I met you. Yes, well, I don't know what it is, but you seem to bring out the very worst in me. -Somehow it's my fault. -AII of this is your fault. You wrote that blasted Letter. Nonetheless, may I walk you to your room? You know, I'm not the buttoned-up, buttock-clenching killjoy you try to make me out as. Right. And I made you argue that true Love is bollocks. Guilty. It's just that I'm genuinely worried for her. I know she may seem carefree, but her Life hasn't been all that simple. Is it that unreasonable for me to worry? No, but I have a really good feeling about this. You'II see. Let's hope you're right. NURSE: Signora Claire. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} Signor Bartolini. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} {SPEAKING ITALIAN} We're not done yet. Of course we're not, darling. {BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN} Hello. -Hello? -Hello. Hi. Is Claire with you? No? No, no. She's turned in early, actually. Okay. I was goanna ask if you wanted dinner, but... I just... I wanted to get started on my story. How's it coming? It's coming okay. Am I in it? -You may be. Why? -Can I read just a Little bit? -Are you kidding me? -Come on, just a Little bit. Absolutely not. How am I to be sure that I'm being properly portrayed? No, you are. Believe me. You are. -What's that supposed to mean? -It means good night, Charlie. -Good night. -Okay. Yeah. Good night. -What? Okay. -Is this one of those situations where you're really saying the opposite of what you actually mean? No. Right. Good night then. Good night, Charlie. Good morning. Good morning. Gran wants to sleep in this morning. Is she okay? I mean, does she need anything? No need. She's tough as old boots, that one. Churchill in a dress. So, I thought I'd see a bit of Siena since we're here. It's a good idea. I suppose you want to keep on writing. I mean... Work, work, work. Admirable trait. Right, of course. Carry on then. Charlie? Since we're here... I hate to compliment you, but what you're doing for Claire is really... It's sweet, and I... I imagine that you'd rather be spending your holiday elsewhere, so did you volunteer your services, or did your parents? I mean, where do they fit in? I'd Like to think they're someplace nice. They were killed in a car accident when I was 10. I'm sorry. God, I'm sorry. CHARLIE: Thank you, Sophie. I appreciate it. It was a difficult time. Gran Lost her son. I Lost my parents. I'm not a big believer in happy endings, I'm afraid. Anyway, Gran stepped in. Took an angry, obnoxious, young boy under her wing and made me the simply unpleasant man I am today. {BELL TOLLING} CHARLIE: So, isn't your fiance starting to get just a tad Lonely? SOPHIE: You know, Victor's having the time of his Life right now. And I doubt he even notices that I'm gone. What about you? -Don't you have a girlfriend? -That is a very, very Long story. Yeah? I'm not surprised. It's been about a year since I've seen Patricia. And you broke up with her? Are you insinuating that I'm more the type to be dumped rather than do the dumping? Maybe I am. Actually, I did break up with Patricia. This time. Okay, that's enough. AII right. That's enough. -Sophie... -That's enough. -Your writing is really good. -Thank you. No. It's really, really, really good. Why are you so surprised? How come you've never shown your work to anyone? -I never feel Like it's finished. -Why? Because I guess I'm a perfectionist. You know that's just another way of saying "I'm a chicken"? Listen. You've got nothing to be afraid of. You're not a fact checker. You're a writer. {BOTH LAUGHING} -What was that for? -I'm not a chicken. -And I'm not a gentleman. - Do you think we should get back to Claire? Yeah. Many more Lorenzo's. Okay. We should get back to Claire. I am Lorenzo Bartolini! Take him! Take him! I am Lorenzo Bartolini! I am Lorenzo Bartolini! Wow. I am Lorenzo Bartolini! {ALL LAUGHING} Do you know what you are? You are the Montague's and the Capulet's. You mean... Well, at Least I'm not Romeo. -That's the understatement of the century. -No, no, no, because you see, if I found the Love of my Life, I wouldn't stand there Like an idiot whispering in a garden. I would just grab her from that blasted balcony and be done with it. Do you believe in destiny? Do you? Yeah, I think so. I think it's destiny that I'm here, right now. With Claire. {CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY} Of course. Of course. With Claire. Well, this is the street. Well, there's 2. Here's number 2. {DOORBELL RINGS} {ALL SPEAKING ITALIAN} This is what I feared the most. -Charlie, we don't even know if it's him. -I hope it's not. I hope it's not. -Either way, we're finished. We're done. -No. Not here. When do we stop? Over the next hill? Or the next? Scour the whole country? No. No. It ends here. There are other Lorenzo's not too far away from here. It's not the ending you want, is it? This isn't just a clever story -with a clever ending. -Stop it, Charlie. -It's our Life. It's my Gran's Life. -It's not about... Charlie, it's not about a story. No, no, no, she's already Lost the man once. How many more times would you have her Lose him? You know what? I don't expect you to understand any of this because you don't know a thing about real Loss. Yeah. You're wrong. Sophie's mother ran away from her when she was a Little girl. It's different, Gran. It's different. You're right. But Sophie's mother chose to Leave her. And you always knew your mum and dad Loved you. {KNOCKING ON DOOR} Come in. Hi. Oh, dear. I just wanted to see if you were all right. I'm okay. Claire, I'm so sorry if I caused you... No. Every minute has been so special. Darling. May I? One of the great joys in Life is having one's hair brushed. CLAIRE: Charlie, say you're sorry. In the eye, Charlie. With contrition. Sophie... -Thank you. -... I'm afraid I... In the eye. Yes, Gran, I'm not 1 2. Prove it. I'm sincerely sorry, Sophie. It won't happen again. Excellent. CLAIRE: Sophie, -I want to make a toast. -Thank you. I want to thank you for the wonderful thing you did for a complete stranger. I'II never forget it. Nor I. I've had the most incredible few days. I really have, and I can't thank you enough for Letting me tag along. I think you did more than tag along. Here is to all our Loved ones, wherever they may be. May I join you? Please. I am sorry, Sophie. I used to Lay out under the stars as a kid, in the summertime. "Doubt thou the stars are fire "Doubt that the sun doth move" CHARLIE: "Doubt truth be a Liar "But never doubt I Love" Do you think he's out there? Lorenzo? Yeah. He's somewhere. And am I wrong? To insist she quit? No, you know, you can't go on forever. At some point, you have to stop. Then why is it that I feel Like a schoolboy on Sunday? It's nearly tomorrow and I don't want to go. Me, either. And I always Liked school. -Morning. -Morning. Thank you. How'd you sleep? I slept fine. How about you? Yes. Great. Thanks. CHARLIE: Good morning. CLAIRE: Good morning. -How are you? -Good morning, my darling. It's a beautiful day. Sophie, would you mind going in the front? Because I'd Love to stretch my Legs for a bit. Okay. Fantastic, darling. CLAIRE: The stars were spectacular from my window. {SINGING IN ITALIAN} Look. That vineyard. That's our favourite wine. Let's turn in there and have a goodbye toast. Okay. Charlie, stop! CHARLIE: Nana, what is it? It's Lorenzo. Who? The boy? AII right, Nana. Let's get you in the shade. Shall we? {SPEAKING ITALIAN} I am Lorenzo Bartolini. Sophie. I think this is... -Do you know a Lorenzo Bartolini? -I asked him and... -I am Lorenzo Bartolini. -You are! Oh, my... Sophie, he's the grandson! -Can I help you? -Yes. We're Looking for a Lorenzo Bartolini. I am Lorenzo Bartolini. -He's Lorenzo, too. -Do you have a father also named Lorenzo? Yes, he went out riding. But what can I do for you? I'm sorry. We're being terribly rude. -I'm Charlie Wyman. -I'm Sophie. Lorenzo. Lorenzo. We have been on quite a journey for your father. You see, my grandmother, Claire, knows him. Charlie. Charlie, Let's go! Let's go! AII right. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} Nana, Nana, Nana, Lorenzo is here. He's out riding, but he's going to be back any minute. Well, then, Let's go before he comes back. Nana, we've come all this way. -Come on. -I've been ridiculous. I've been completely ridiculous. He knew me when I was 15 years old, a girl. That girl's gone. {HORSE APPROACHING} Oh, my God. Claire? Yes. So many years. Yes, 50. {SPEAKING ITALIAN} {BOTH SPEAKING ITALIAN} If you allow me. I really don't know how to express myself. Well, I went for a ride this morning as an old man, and I came back as a teenager again. I'm so very happy you all meet Claire and her grandson, Charlie, and their Lovely friend, Sophie. My dear Claire, you have told me you Lost your Jack. -And you know I Lost my Rosa. -Yeah. But destiny wanted us to meet again. {THANKING IN ITALIAN} {ALL TOASTING} CLAIRE: Health to the Bartolini family. CHARLIE: To the Bartolinis. I'm sorry I was late. No. When we are speaking about Love, it's never too late. Well, bad Luck, eh? AII hope Lost and he rides in at the Last moment on a white horse. No one will believe it. Promise me... Promise me you'II finish the story. I guess this is it. And I'm sorry it is. Yeah, me, too. Sophie, I... I never should've kissed you. I was completely out of bounds. Mmm. You're engaged and... It's time to go. Goodbye, Charlie. I'II miss you. Hi. It is time to... I must get back to Victor. Sorry. Yes. Of course. So, where's Charlie? We'II give you a drive there straight away. No, I'm... Claire, I can't take you away from this place, so... My son can drive you. -Just a moment. -Yes. Grazie. I'm so happy for you. Is something wrong? No! No. No. It's just, you know... And you're Leaving? An angel brought you to me. Thank you. Thank you. I'II be eternally grateful. Thank you. It's very kind. Thank you. Thank you so much. -You're always welcome here. -Thank you. -Thank you, Lorenzo. -Ciao. Speak soon. Bye. Darling, you're family, so I think you'II understand why I'm telling you you're a total idiot. Okay, okay, then don't sugarcoat it, Gran. I won't. How many Sophies do you think there are on this planet? Don't wait 50 years Like I did. Go. Go! Go! I missed you so much! So much. ...in person because I couldn't send you an e-mail, {CELL PHONE RINGING} because it was... It just didn't make sense, because I know you were having... One second. Hello? Hey. Yeah, yeah. We just have to sort out all the deliveries that we need to make. I mean... What happened? You don't Like the ending? No, the ending's fine. It's actually quite moving. But what happened to the people? I mean, are they still together? What about... What about the kid? What about Charlie? Where's he? I don't know. I didn't keep in touch. Do you have any advice? I think you should buy stock in Alitalia, 'cause all the Ladies are goanna be flocking to Verona. Are you goanna publish this? Yeah, I'm goanna publish it. It's a good story. You got anything else for me? No, not at the moment. Oh, my God. You said Tuscan gold, right? Tuscan gold? Look. This is yellow. Yellow. Tuscan gold. Yellow. I mean, there's no Tuscany, there's no gold. -It's just Like Limoncello, you know. -Sure. -Yeah? Can we do it again? -Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah? AII right, all right, all right. -Let's go. Come on. Let's try it again. -VICTOR: Hey, Sophie. -Hi. Hey, how's your day been? -I showed my story to Bobby. -Did he Like it? Yeah, he's goanna print it. -Print it? -Yeah. Wow! Wow. That's pretty great, huh? -I know. Did you read it? -Yeah, yeah. -No. I... -Last night I Left it out for you to read. I don't need to. I mean, I know it's goanna be great. Plus, I'm goanna see it... I'm goanna see it when it comes out. That's why I prefer to buy it. -You know, I'm surprised, Like... -Yeah. -You know? Like... -MAN: Watch out!

And without that Letter, none of us would be here today. Sophie, would you mind if I read out the words you wrote to me? AII right? "Dear Claire, 'what' and 'if' "are two words as non-threatening as words can be. "But put them together, side by side, "and they have the power to haunt you for the rest of your Life. "What if? "What if? "What if? "I don't know how your story ended, "but if what you felt then was true Love "then it's never too late. "If it was true then, why wouldn't it be true now? "You need only the courage "to follow your heart. "I don't know what a Love Like Juliet's feels Like, "a Love to Leave Loved ones for, a Love to cross oceans for, "but I'd Like to believe, if I ever were to feel it, "that I'd have the courage to seize it. "And, Claire, if you didn't, "I hope one day that you will. "AII my Love, "Juliet" {SPEAKING ITALIAN} {UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING} I'II be right back, all right, Gran? Sophie? Sophie? Sophie?

I should have realized sooner, but I didn't, or I guess maybe I couldn't, but Victor and I aren't together anymore. -And I guess I came back hoping that... -Wait, wait. You're not engaged? No. But it's too late. It's clearly too late. And it really doesn't matter anymore because, honestly, I Love you. I can't believe I just said that. But I do, I Love you. It doesn't... I mean, it shouldn't matter to you, -because you're here with Patricia. -Patricia? And you should be back with her right now. Patricia is my cousin. She's my cousin. -How is that Legal? -No... Sophie... No. No, no, no. Let me explain! Sophie, I'm so stupid. There's two Patricias. There's my cousin, who's here, and the one that I've completely forgotten about. More importantly, there's only one Sophie. Now, would you please come down? Wait, Charlie. Charlie, stop. What are you doing? Charlie, what are you doing? Listen to me. Listen to me very, very carefully. I Live in London, a gorgeous, vibrant, historic city that I happen to Love Living in. You Live in New York, which is highly overrated. -Pardon me? - But since the Atlantic Ocean is a bit wide to cross every day, swimming, boating or flying, I suggest we flip for it. What are you saying? And if those terms are unacceptable, Leaving London will be a pleasure, as Long as you're waiting for me on the other side. 'Cause the truth is, Sophie, I am madly, deeply, truly, passionately in Love with you. You are? I am. -Are you goanna kiss me? -Yeah. Yeah. Oh,myGod! Charlie! Ican'tbelieveIjust didthat. Hi.

No, ugh, I'm not... I'm not a writer. I'm a fact checker, actually. It is a bit like being a detective, yes. Let's see if you are the Robert Beal that I'm looking for. Can-can you confirm where you were when you found out World War II was over? Oh, Poughkeepsie? All right. Right, thank you so much. Yes, the moment the war ended. Oh, Palm Beach? Okay. Lucky guy. Thank you very much. Bye. Bobby, hey, I got nothing, um, but there's two more Robert Beals, and one petty officer, third class. Wait. Oh, I'm gonna call you back. Sophie Hall. Can you confirm where you were when you found out World War II was over? Times Square? I'm in Times Square right now. I'm standing exactly where the photograph was taken. I really thought I would never find you. So, can you... Can I ask you to describe what you saw that day? The kiss, was it spontaneous or was it staged? It was. You're certain? So you're 100% positive? Petty Officer First Class Robert Beal, who was second sailor, said that the nurse was the bee's knees and... that the kiss was a completely spontaneous moment and a celebration of real love. - And he told you this himself? - Yes, he did. Cause it's not often that I request a personal audience with a fact checker. It's cause I need to know you're sure. I'm 100% positive. Great. I guess people wanna believe in true love, don't they? Speaking of which, I understand that you're headed off to Verona for a pre-honeymoon? Explain that to me. It's just a vacation before the wedding. It's our last chance to spend time alone before his restaurant... - Well, it's the city of love, isn't it? Yeah. Uh, but I... Good choice, and good work. Thank you. I was thinking. What if while I'm there, I write? But... you're such a good fact checker. Have a great trip. - Thank you. See you later. Who goes on a honeymoon without a wedding? You are so lucky. Well, Victor's restaurant opens in six weeks, so it's our last chance. Okay, do not let him pay attention to anything but you, okay? You throw his cell phone in the Adriatic. - But he has to meet suppliers. - Sophie... - It's fine. I promise. Okay. Wait, what? Hey, sweetheart, can I help you carry your magazine? Okay, no problem. Oh, my God. Hey, close your eyes. Close your eyes, close your eyes. Close your eyes, close your eyes. Close your eyes. Open your mouth. It's good? - Yeah. Yes? No? Yes? Yes? I reinvented the noodle, I'm telling you. Just try this one because this one's really good. It's the same thing, but different. Fatter. - Mmm. - More of, um, you know...? No? It's good, right? - Mmm-hmm. Yeah? You know, I mean, modestly speaking, I think I'm creating a masterpiece. I don't know. I-I mean, there's one... there's one that-that just came out perfect right now, - Victor? - ...which is... I think it's this one. I think it's still... - Victor, Victor... - Try it. Even though it's dry, try it. - Can I just say something? - What? We're leaving in 12 hours, and you haven't packed for Verona. At all. - Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right, yeah. - I get too carried away. - Do we clean this up? No, no. It's gonna be incredible. - I know. I'm so excited. Sophia! Sophia! Wherefore art thou, my sweet Sophia? I love this place. I love. Right? - It's amazing. - I have to show you the most beautiful... - You know what's even more amazing? - What? - I just got off the phone with Signor Morini, and he's arranged a private tour for us with each and every one of my suppliers. We're starting off with the oldest and most beautiful vineyard in all of Veneto. Yeah? Victor. Sophie, come on. No, you're not-you're no getting it. I mean, we're gonna go to the oldest, the most beautiful vineyard around. This is romantic. All right? We're gonna go there, we're gonna drink a little wine, we're gonna get a little tipsy, we're gonna come back and we're gonna... I mean, how was it? - I tried to talk to Bobby again. - How did it go? It didn't go, because I didn't talk to him. - Why? - Because I was scared. Really? It's time for me to stop checking facts and actually start writing. Yeah, yeah, i-it's your passion. You should do that. It's-it's the-the grape that I told you about that they use for the region, Soave? - Right, right, right. - You know. - Oh, yeah. You remember? Mmm. Mmm! - Do you like? - This is good. Wow. It's fresh flower and fruit. Do you feel it? Yeah? You feel it? It's so good. Smile. Sophie. Mmm! Mmm-hmm. We have to get tickets to the opera before they sell out. We need to see the Castelvecchio. We have to see Lake Garda and Juliet's house. - Yeah, of course. Yeah. Sophie, this is beautiful. This is incredible. The smell... Mmm! Sophie, this is amazing! This is great! I wish I was a little... a little mouse living in your cheese cave. Hey, that was Signor Morini on the phone. You know, he's inviting us to this incredible forest, that's just, like, 120 kilometers away. And they dig these exquisite truffles... - Wait. 120 kilometers? - Yeah, it's not like miles, Sophie. - No, I understand the difference, but I just, uh... I-I just don't understand why you wanna go 120 kilometers to see... to see a mushroom. It's not a mushroom, okay? It's a truffle. It's a... it's a tartufo. It's the thing that you put on top of pasta, you know? - A tartufo? - It's something else. It's co... Oh, come on, you've been having a good day, right? It-it was fine. But now, I just... To be honest, I don't really feel like going to see a mushroom. Okay, fine, I get it. I get it. It's fine. I get it. I mean, just don't call it a mushroom, okay? Uh, yeah, okay. You know what? Why don't you go see the truffle place and I'll go do my thing and sightsee? - Really? Yeah. Win-win. "My dear Juliet... " "Dear Juliet, the man that I love is not my husband. " Are you okay? Take this basket and... Come si dice? Um, dig in. Dig in? You are the translator from the employment office? - No... No, I mean... - I have been waiting two weeks. I'm sorry. Um, my name is Sophie. I just... I followed you, and... I saw that you put the letters into a basket, and... I just wondered why. Why? You are a writer? Yeah, I am. I am a writer. Come. I show you. They come from all over the world every day. But taking their letters? Is that... not like taking... pennies from a wishing well? How else can we give them answers? Oh, my God. So, you write all of them back. Yes. - You're all Juliet? - Her secretaries. Donatella has been married 51 years to the same man. She handles husband problems. Husbands are like wine. They-they take a long time to mature. Francesca is a nurse. She deals with illness and loss. And Maria... Why do you always sigh when you say my name? She has 12 children, 29 grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren. She writes whatever she likes. - And you? Isabella answers the ones you can barely read. Yeah, the lovers' quarrels, the breakups, the really tangled hearts. Someone has to do it. Oh, my mother. Would you like to stay for dinner, Sophie? Mamma, this is not an insult. I make a beautiful dish, big enough for, uh, for the whole town, and she says "no". I would love to, but I do... I have to go. This is the problem of the americani. Always running. - Please, mamma. I have to meet my fiancé. Fiancé? At least... take some dessert for you and your fiancé. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know, 120 kilometers each way and I'm still beating you? - Congratulations. - What? Yeah. What? I mean, how-how was Verona? How was it... without me? Empty? Half-empty? Completely empty? Half-empty. I met the secretaries of Juliet. - Juliet? Jul... like Juliet Capulet? - Yeah. There are these women that call themselves the secretaries of Juliet, and they write letters to people that write letters to Juliet. And then these secretaries, they work for the city of Verona, and, like, all these people, these brokenhearted women all over the world, come and they write letters and leave them on the wall. - What's in the bag? I... don't know. So, they post these letters. They post them on the wall in Juliet's courtyard, and then these secretaries come back with this basket and they retrieve the letters every day. And then they write back, as Juliet, to all the letters that have return addresses on them. Mmm-hmm. This is their job. I mean, it's so unbelievable. This is their passion. It's what they do every day. Mmm. Mmm. - They literally will work all day, every day. - Mmm! Oh, my God! - And they've been doing it for years. - Sophie. Wow. This is incredible! And they... This is incredible. This is incredible. Oh, my God. This is great. Try this, try this. You have to try this. Oh, my God. No... Give it a good bite. Come on. Your Victor is very passionate. Yes, yes, I know. But, um, he seems to think that he's Italian since we got here. And although imitation is, of course, the highest form of flattery, his imitations are not very good. Okay, that woman is amazing. I mean, she's incredible. She's incredible. I think I'm in love. Absolutely. - Oh, you're in love with her? - Yeah. Yeah. - Really? Okay. Just say "no". Just say "no", and I won't do it, really. I mean, I'm dying to do it, but I won't. Okay. What? Angelina's offered to teach me some secrets today. - Okay. - Yeah. Okay, right now and all day? Like, right now. That's crazy, right? I mean, now. That's amazing. I mean, she's making risotto all'amarone, right? Yeah? - Good risotto. - You see? You see, it's, like, 300 years old or something, her recipe. It's fantastic. Okay. That's great. But, um... So, no Lake Garda then today? Oh, yeah. Lake Garda... I mean, Lake Garda's been there for, like, 500,000 years, you know. And right now, Angelina's offered to help me. And, you know, I mean, I'm here, we're here, you know, we're having a good time. - You, Paul Newman, you want to work, you have to watch! You see? I mean, you see, I became Paul Newman. All right? Okay, what shall I do? I mean, my hands are tied. I don't know. I don't know. You could help us if you like. - Oh, yeah! Yeah. The letter thing, right? - Oh, why not? Yeah, yeah, you write the letters and I'll cook. And later we eat and... Win-win. How long have you and Victor been engaged? Almost a year. Wow. And may I ask why don't you wear an engagement ring? Yeah, see, that's... That's me. I insisted. He-he was so busy, you know, this whole restaurant and everything. And I... I guess I felt it unnecessary. Still, a girl should have a ring. "I didn't go to him, Juliet. "I didn't go to Lorenzo. "His eyes were so full of trust. "I promised I'd meet him to run away together "because my parents don't approve. "But instead, I left him waiting for me, below our tree, "waiting and wondering where I was. "I'm in Verona now. "I return to London in the morning, and I'm so afraid. "Please, Juliet, tell me what I should do. "My heart is breaking, and... I have no one else to turn to. "Love, Claire." And it's been there for all those years? I-I think... she came back to find her one true love. And they had 10 children and still make passionate love every night. Except he got bald and fat and she has to do all the work. - Francesca. - Francesca. And maybe... she stayed in London and married a duke and lived happily ever after, just like me. - But you married an accountant, not a duke. - Nobody's perfect. And I bet when she's making love to that duke... - Yeah? - ... she's imagining her first love, Lorenzo. Isabella, I... I have to write back. Then answer her. Good night, friends. Good night. Hey. Hey. - Sorry I'm late. - No, it's fine. No worries. How was your day? Good? - It was... - It was so good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Good. I'm glad. How was Angelina? Yeah, it was... it was good. I mean, she's amazing, you know. That woman is incredible. She's... very instinctive, you know. She cooks without recipes. I mean, she's incredible. She's invited me to cook again. - Really? Yeah. Yeah, I think I can learn a lot from her. But, um... Oh, no, no, you-you first, you first. Sorry, sorry. - Uh, no, just real quick. I just... - Mmm-hmm? I had the most amazing day. I got to answer a letter that was written 50 years ago. I know it might not get there, but it just feels so good to write. Yeah, I think you should spend more time with them. - Why? - Because... it's your passion, right? And also because it fits perfectly. Because I just got off the phone with Signor Morini, and he's invited me to this amazing wine auction that's happening in Livorno. - In Livorno? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, uh, it's super-exclusive. I mean, I don't know... I don't know if I can get a ticket, you know? I mean, I'll be off, like, a day or two, max. If you want, I'll try to get two tickets, but I'm not sure I can get two tickets. - Yeah. To a wine auction? In Livorno? Yeah, it sounds terrible. I know, I know... I'm sorry. I'm so... I feel terrible now. I feel terrible. I mean, it's... I miss you already, you know. I'll be back very soon. Okay? - Yeah. Be careful. Ciao. Listen to what this poor girl writes. "Juliet, is there anything worse in this world than a man?" Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt, but are you the secretaries of Juliet? - Yes, that's us. - Great. May I ask, which one of you wrote this letter to my grandmother, Claire Smith? I wrote that. And I can't believe that it found you. Yes. We Brits tend to stay in our family homes. Yeah. This is amazing. It's less than a week since I mailed it. It was a very... thoughtful letter. Now, what were you thinking? I was thinking that she deserved an answer. Yeah, 50 years ago, maybe. Not now. I-I'm sorry. I didn't know true love had an expiration date. True love? Are you... are you joking? Could you imagine what would've happened if she hadn't seen sense? Well, yeah, you wouldn't be here, and that would be an upside. What are you doing here anyway? What, are you some... lonely American girl who has to live vicariously through others? I'm not lonely. I'm engaged. My condolences to the groom. Excuse me! So that's it? You've come all the way from London to give me a lecture? No, I came because I couldn't let my grandmother come on her own. Claire is here? Why? I think even you might be able to work that one out. Oh, my God! That's awesome! She's come to find her Lorenzo! Awesome? And if Lorenzo doesn't want to see her, has forgotten her, is gravely ill or... dead, let's say, just for fun, then what? Thought so. I wanna meet her. I'd like to meet Claire. And I want to play for Manchester United, but I'm shit at football. You don't think that she wants to meet me? I honestly think she has no interest meeting a woman that can manage to jam "Oh, my God" and "awesome" into the same sentence. Gran, they're closing up. We should go now. Excuse me. Claire? Hi. Hi. My name is Sophie, and... I wrote you the letter. Letter? From Juliet? Goodness! Thank you. Thank you. But however did you find us? - Well, your grandson found me, actually. - You did? Right, well, the-the thing is, I thought we should... - Yeah, well, he's very sweet and... very charming, and he thought that you might like to meet me. Uncharacteristically thoughtful of you, dear. Yes, well, under the circumstances, it, uh, seems a little churlish not to meet the woman responsible for this voyage of lunacy. - Okay. Charlie doesn't approve, which makes this all the more fun. We were just going for a glass of wine. Would you like to join us? Absolutely not. - What? - Absolutely not. It's been a long day. It's... too long a day. - Okay, darling. Have a good sleep. - But I... Do you know somewhere we could go? I... actually have the perfect place. I can't believe you're really here. I was taking an art course in Tuscany, staying with a family outside Siena, and they had a son Lorenzo, and it was... love at first sight. He had such gentle blue eyes. And he told me I was very beautiful. And he gave me... this ring. We wanted to get married, but... I'd got exams back in England and my parents would never have agreed, and I got scared, and... I ran away. Now, what I really want is to... tell him that I'm so sorry I was such a coward. Of course, a card or letter is just too simple. So, Luke. If you want to make a complaint against DI Frost, I'll deal with it. We know he's a corrupt officer. But not now, in here. You're just not getting it, are you? I'm getting that you're right out of your skull. You'd better get out of this courtroom before someone searches you. Filthy bastard! Do I have to get the usher to call the police? Yeah, ask for Frost. He knows what happened that day. He said either you or me followed Richie up to Fulford Woods. Classic copper's trick, Luke. Oldest trick in the books. Get smart. I have. That's what I like to see, Jack. A nice bit of European co-operation. They say we're all one now, don't they? Clever girl. Yeah, she looked like it. Sir. Lads. Yeah, she got it wrong though, didn't she? It wasn't Ben Pecksmith was it? It was our friend Richie Dearne. We still haven't got his killer though, have we? No. We will. Mr. Frost! Yes? Sir. Yeah? We've got a man armed with a gun in Denton courthouse. Oh my god. Go and tell the Witch in the Wardrobe. Tell her to send an armed back-up. I'm on my way over there now. Hey, Jack. Hold on a minute You've got to have a flak jacket, you know that's the rule. Yes, I know. And whilst I wait fifteen minutes for you to get me one, someone's been shot? Send one over with Dorridge, if you must. He's in the courtroom. Near the dock. Is the court sitting? Not today. Just Mr. Warrinder. He came in to check a brief. Warrinder. Know the gunman? Should do, he's been here often enough. Oh my god, it's not Luke Hands, is it? Yes. Shouldn't you wait for reinforcements? Yes, yes, I should, shouldn't I? tell me something, you can get to the dock from underneath can't you, from the cells? Yes. Right. Come on then. Why do you want me in the dock? Why do I want you in the dock? 'Cos that always where I am, isn't it? But this time it's not me, it's you. For god's sake, Luke, let's talk this over. Well I know you're guilty. I'm not, Luke. Calm down, just relax. I know you killed Richie. Put that away, before you kill someone. That's what you did, right? Killed Richie. Don't be absurd, Luke, I just got him out of custody. I looked after him, Luke. Looked after both of you. Come on, you bastard. I want to hear you say it. All right. Listen, what are you doing to our friend, Mr. Warrinder? Thank God. Bastard! Luke, just calm down. Take it easy. Just calm down. He's got a confession to make. Tell him. I didn't do anything. You're crazy, Luke. Listen to me Luke. Listen to me. If you pull that trigger, it won't prove anything. It'll only ensure you get banged up for the rest of your life. He killed Richie. I want to hear him say it. You're high, Luke. I'm not the only cokehead round here though, am I Warrinder? He was blackmailing you, over your habit, right? Had you right where it hurt. I'd just got him out of custody. Yeah, then he asked you for another favor, five grand, I saw you, man. On Bentinck Street. You waited around, then when Richie hotted off, you followed him to Fulford Woods. Say it. I followed him. Say it! I followed him, okay. And then I killed him, in Fulford Woods. Say it! And then I killed him in Fulford Woods. All right, all right, all right, Luke, all right, all right, you got what you wanted, give me the gun. I want to see you arrest him. All right. Mr. Warrinder, I arrest you on the suspicion of murder of Richard Dearne. Do it properly. Read him his rights. Morning, marm. What's happening? Man with a gun in the courtroom. Frost's in there. Without a flak jacket. You don't surprise me. Okay men. You have the authority. Let's do it. Mr. Warrinder, I'm arresting you on the suspicion of murder of Richard Dearne. It may harm your defense if, when questioned, you fail to mention something that you've come to rely on in court. Anything that you do say may be used in evidence. Thank you, Mr. Frost. May I go now? No you may not. I've just told you you're under arrest. This kid's a known drugs dealer. Is he? Is he really? Mr. Hands has been charged with that offence on many occasions. But he's never been convicted, as you well know, Mr. Warrinder. A totally unreliable witness. That's as maybe but I've got two very reliable witnesses who saw you at Fulford Woods. I was in court that afternoon. Yeah. But you were in the bank the day before, withdrawing five thousand pounds from your account. Don't be ridiculous. I've checked with your bank. It's part of my job. You did go to the woods, you did meet Richard Dearne, and you did strike him on the back of the head with a lump of wood. Don't you see how absurd it is? The money was found on the body. If I'd killed him I'd have taken it back again. You would've if you could, but you were in a hurry to hide that body, cos there were people running about in the woods. That's where you saw the boot of the Merc unlocked. In went the body, away went the Merc, and Richard Dearne went on his holidays with your five thousand pounds in his pocket. Isn't that right, Mr. Warrinder? Yes, yes. Thank you. Thank you. All right, Luke, come on, it's all over now, it's all over, good boy, give me the gun. It's all right. You don't believe all that. What I said was under duress. Oh but I do believe it, Mr. Warrinder? Pure surmise, Inspector. It wouldn't stand up in court for a minute. And I will sue you for unlawful arrest. Really. You said that you were in the court that Friday afternoon. Was he, Mr. Usher? No, Inspector. Mr. Warrinder failed to appear for the defense that day. The case had to be adjourned. It won't stick, Frost. Oh I think it will Mr. Warrinder. Take him to the station. I'll interview him myself. Ms. Cremond, you know very well this officer has been harassing me for days. You're under arrest, Mr. Warrinder. I've never known a senior officer behave in such a way. You interviewed a suspect under duress. You didn't wear a flak jacket. Well, thank you very much for you concern, marm. But the gun was empty. I'm not concerned. I'm reprimanding you. Oh, really? You couldn't know it was empty could you? No. No, I didn't marm. But we did get the killer. You'd better hope so. If the evidence doesn't stick, you won't just face a suit for unlawful arrest, you'll be up before an official enquiry. Well, marm, if you'd like to check Warrinder's fingerprints with forensic? Because they've got the dabs on the murder weapon and on the money. Inspector if Warrinder was a suspect, why didn't you take his prints sooner? Because I was just following your instructions, marm. Don't harass Mr. Warrinder. And when you check the prints, and they match, which they will, perhaps you'd be kind enough to charge Mr. Warrinder. Inspector. I can't find it easy to admit this, but I have to say... I know what you're going to say, marm. But if you'll excuse me, I could do with a bloody good cup of tea. I'm moving out, so you're in charge of paying the rent. -When's it due? -On the first. And that's every month? No, just the months you want to live here. Okay, here's the phone bill. Oh, my God! That's our phone number. I know I kind of sprung this me-moving-out-on-you thing. -Why don't I cover you for a while? -No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity... ... anymore. -It's not charity, Joe. -Forget it. Thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. I can take care of myself. What's next? Come on. Here's the electric bill. -This is how much we pay for electric? -Well, yeah. So we'll do the rest of the bills later, then? The One On The Last Night Will Joey have to give up the apartment? I offered him money, but he wouldn't take it. How much does he need? $1 500 would cover him for a few months... ... butI haveto trickhim into taking it so I don't hurt his pride. Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on skits whenever you want. Well, that would help the pride thing. Wow, you look great! Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow? Any plans for tonight? Instead of being sad on my last night with Rachel... ... we'regoingouttocelebrate Rachel's moving in with Phoebe. -And also my birthday. -It's not your birthday. What a mean thing to say! I'd never tell you it wasn't your birthday. You guys have anything planned for the big last night? Instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing. Knicks' season opener tonight. I thought you'd come and watch it. I don't know, Ross. Not if you talk about how you gave up basketball to become a paleontologist. I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist! -Pheebs-- -You're not dressed yet? We're supposed to start having fun in 1 5 minutes! And clearly, not a minute sooner. You are packed, though, right? Please tell me you're packed? Of course I'm packed. Monica, relax. I wanted to ask Phoebe what I should wear. My God, I can't get a minute of peace. Oh, my God! Monica's just gonna kill you. I know. What you're wearing is fine for that. You're not packed! You're not packed even a little bit! Surprise! Don't get mad, because this is what happened. I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing?" I am lousy at packing, right? But you love packing! So as a gift to you on our last night... . I'll be coordinator! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I didn't get you anything. Everybody has to help. Phoebe, can you help? I have plans. -You have plans with us. -That's right. Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift. Tell the guys they have to help out. My God, thank you! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save yourselves! The movers will be here in 1 1 hours. Rachel hasn't packed. Now, everybody has to help. Chandler-- I have plans with Joey. -You said you were doing nothing. -Yes, but for the last time. Fine. Now, Ross-- -I can't do it. -Why not? -Don't you have Ben? -Because I have Ben! It's almost past his bedtime. Where is he? He's at a dinner party. He's really coming? I can see in your apartment. Of course he is. What? You think I'd use my son as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am? All right. Sorry. I gotta go make a fake Ben. Here it is. Our last pizzas together as roommates. I wish I knew that. I ordered Chinese. Well, that's okay. In a way it's kind of nice. You know? Our last dinner together. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors... ... you,thefoodofyours! I had an idea for what to do on our last night. What do you say we play a little foosball for money? Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me since my injury-plagued '97 season. -It'd be easier to give me your money. -Yes, it would. What do you say to $50? -You're on. -Okay, let's play. The big game. Italy versus... ... China,apparently. Look, it's the Rollerblades. Oh, God! You remember when we got these? I guess you weren't there. You guys, we said we were gonna have fun. Come on. Hey, remember the time... . You don't remember? Sorry, Pheebs. I'm just really sad that I'm leaving. I'm gonna miss you so much. This doesn't have to be so sad, though, you know? Instead of thinking about how you'll miss each other... ... youshouldthinkofthethings you're not gonna miss. I don't think there's anything. Come on, there's gotta be something. She's perfect. I have one. Okay, you can go first. I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact... ... thatyou'reneverallowed to move the phone pen. That's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? You know, does Rachel move the phone pen? Sometimes. Always, actually. There you go. Doesn't everyone feel better? Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages. You get your messages. It doesn't count if you have to read them off your hand... ... afteryou'vefallenasleep on the couch. So you missed a message from who? Chandler? Or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? It worked! No one's sad! I win again! That's, like, 500 bucks you owe me! Man! Five hundred dollars. That is a lot of electricity, huh? I gotta buy some food. Give me a chance to win my money back. Sudden death... ... onegoal,$1 000. -You serious? -Yes! Get ready to owe me. Here we go. Ready? No... ... onecanbeatme! That's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking. Hi, Ross. See, other people call me! Your brother. Score! What's up? I'm here with Ben. Thought we'd say hi. Put him on. Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling, though. Okay, talk to you later. I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, remember the Rollerblades? You know what else I won't miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilets 1 7 times a day, even if people are on it! " "Hi, I'm Rachel. Is my sweater too tight? I'd better wash it and shrink it! " "I'm Monica. I never get messages from interesting people. " I call her. "Oh, my God! I love Ross. I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross! " "My God! I can't find a boyfriend. I'll stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find there! " We should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations. Still broken? It sucks, man. Your last night, and I lose the two most important things: The foosball table... ... and$ 500. There are other ways to win back your money. How about blackjack? Not my game. You know what? We can play a new game. -It's fun! -What's it called? Cups. -I don't know how. -I'll teach you. It's easy and fun. -All right. -Here you go. I have two queens. What do you have? -A 2 and a 5. -You win! Fifty dollars! -Really? -Let's play again. -What have you got? -4 and a 9. You're kidding, right? -No. Why? -That's a full cup! Damn, I am good at Cups! I'm not talking to her. You have to take the first step... ... becauseshe'stheone who 's leaving. It's harder for her. Maybe you're right. But she made fun of my phone pen! I know. I took it hard too. I feel bad about what happened-- -What are you doing? -I'm unpacking. I'm not moving. Is that picture straight? It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left. You're the one who wants this big change and move in with Chandler! You should go! Why do I have to leave? -It's my apartment! -It's mine too! What else you got? How about: You're moving! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you! -Hey, how you guys doing? -Great. Monica's moving. I am not! Really? How come all your stuff is in this box? Okay, you guys, I think I know what's going on here! You guys? Stop! I know you're acting mad because it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down, you're really sad. Deep, deep down. -No, Phoebe, I am mad! -Well, deep down! I'm just mad. Then keep running. You win! -What did you have? -Nothing beats... ... athreeandasix. That, my friend, is "D Cup. " How much have you won so far? -700. -Not 700 exactly? Double it. In Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get one card. That one card could be worth $1 00, which brings your total to $1 500. Don't get excited, that won't happen unless you get the- - No way! This is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it "What were you thinking?" I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Guys, I don't wanna make things worse, but... ... Idon'twannalivewith Rachel anymore. You're so mean to each other. I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel. I still like you. That's fine because I'm not moving. Phoebe, you gotta take her. I said some bad stuff... ... butRachelhasqualities that make her a good roommate. Like what, Monica? She has 1 47,000 pair of boots? Good start, Mon. She lets you borrow them. And you stretch them out with your big old clown feet. Do you wanna live outside? Because it's getting cold! She gets tons of catalogs and folds down the pages of things I'd like. What else? When I take a shower... ... sheleavesme notesonthemirror. I do. I do do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch... ... shecoversme withablanket. Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her I was gonna move in with Chandler... ... shewasreallysupportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! It's gonna be fine. Now I can't wait to live with you! You know what we should do? Bring Monica, and we'll live together! We'll have so much fun! I think she's moving in with Chandler. Oh, that's right. You're still set on that? Kinda. Oh, my God! How's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. He's right-- Oh, my God! Get your head out of your shirt there, son! Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. -What's wrong? -Ross and I were helping pack... ... tooka littlebreak. I lost $1 500 to him in Cups! How did you lose at Cups? The same way you lost! I started out with the king and the queen. Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a jack and a king. Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5. Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup... ... thesitting-downbonus. Ididn 't even get half a cup! Nothing! Oh, man! He never played before either. I think beginner's luck is very important in Cups! Let's play one more hand. One more hand. No more! I cannot lose another dime. I'm serious this time. In fact, look. I wanna give you something. Let me give it to you before I pawn it for Cups money. I want you to have the big, white dog... ... asa thank-youforbeing such a great roommate. I can't take the big, white dog. You love it. It's "him. " Not "it. " What if I bought it from you? Then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price. Say $1 500? Wait a second. I see what you're trying to do here. You're trying to give me money again! When did I try to give you money? Over there with the bills! You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it. We had a nice last night together. We had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money. Now you start with the charity thing again! I'm trying to help you out. I wanna make sure that you're okay. I will be okay. You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing I'm gonna miss... ... isyou. And now the dog. -Call me when you get there, okay? -Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. I have your key. -Here you go. -Thanks. God, this is silly. I'll see you in a couple of hours. Bye, house. -She really left. -I know. -Thank you. -No problem, roomie. -Can I ask you a question? -Sure. What the hell is that dog doing here? I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. -And now you want that money back? -Exactly. What kind of idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game. I made it up. I'm sorry you lost your money. But I won it fair and square. At a fake game! If you wanna try to make some of it back... ... I'dbegladtoplay youforit . But I should warn you. I am very good at Cups. I assume the saucer card came up when you played last? Let's see if it comes up this time. Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent. Right! And when is that due? - First of the month. - And that's every month? No, just the months you actually want to live here. Okay, here is the phone bill. Oh my God! That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing. So why don't I just? why don't I just cover you for a while? No- no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity. ¡¦anymore. - It's not charity, Joe¡¦ - No! Forget it! Okay? I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on. Okay uh, here's the electric bill. - This is how much we pay for electric? ! - Uh, yeah. So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then? So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment? No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it. Well, how much do you think he needs? I figure that $1, 500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride. Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want. Well that would help the pride thing. Hey! Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow? - Okay. - Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight? Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel... We thought we'd go out to dinner. And celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe. And also, my birthday. It's not your birthday. What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday! - Hey! - Hey! Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night? Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing. Whoa- whoa- whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it. I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist. I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist! - Pheebs, I was wondering¡¦ - You're not dressed yet? We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes! Well and clearly not a minute sooner. Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed. Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight. My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place. Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you. Yeah, yeah, I know. Well, what you're wearing is fine for that. Rachel, I need to borrow? You're not packed! You're not packed even a little bit! Surprise! What? No, no don't get mad because look? this is what happened. So I - I started packing, then I realized. "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night. Ta- da! I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe? I have plans. - You're plans were with us. - That's right. All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out! Okay. Oh my God, thank you! Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves! Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with¡¦ Oh nope, I - I have plans with Joey. I thought you said you were going to do nothing. Yes, but for the last time. - Okay fine, now Ross¡¦ - Oh, but- but I can't do it. Why not? I've got Ben. Because, because I've got Ben. It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where- where is he? He's at a dinner party. Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment! Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as- as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am? All right, sorry. I gotta go make a fake Ben. Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates. Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese. Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours! Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money? What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued'97 season. - It would be easier if you just give me your money. - Yes it would. What do you say to $50? - Okay, you're on. - Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently. Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades. Oh God! You remember when we got these? No. I guess you weren't there. You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time¡¦ You don't remember? I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving. I'm gonna miss you so much. Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss. I don't think there's anything. Come on, there's gotta be something. Nope, she's perfect. I have one. Good! Great! You can go first. Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen? Aw, sometimes. Always, actually. Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better? Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages. You get your messages! Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch. So- so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? Great! It worked! No one's sad. Yes! I win again! Ha- ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo- ho- hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo- ho- ho! I gotta buy some food. Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1, 000. - You serious? - Oh yes! - Okay, get ready to owe me! - Okay. Okay, here we go. Ready? No! No! No! No? One can beat me. See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me! Ooh, your brother. Score! What's up? Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi. Oh, put him on! Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later. Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades? You know what else I'm not gonna miss?" I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!" "Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!" "I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!" Hey! I call her! "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!" "Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"' Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. Still broken? This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life. The foosball table and..... $500. Well, there are other ways of winning back your money. How about a little uh, a little Blackjack? Nah, not my game. Okay, uh, how about, how about? y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun. Well, what's it called? Cups. - I don't know how to play Cups. - I'll teach ya! - Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun. - All right. Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have? A two and a five. Ho- ho, you win! 50 dollars! - Really? - Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got? A four and a nine. You're kidding right? No. Why? Well that's a full cup! Damn! I am good at Cups! I'm not talking to her! Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her! Well, maybe you're right? She made fun of my phone pen! I know, I took it hard too. Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about? What are you doing? I'm unpacking! What? I'm not moving! Is that picture straight? It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left! Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave? - Because it's my apartment! - Well it's mine too! What else you got? How about, you're moving! Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you! Hey, how are you guys doing? Great! Monica's moving! I am not! Oh really? Then how come all your stuff is in this box? Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys¡¦ STOP! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep- deep down. No Phoebe I am mad! Well, deep- deep- deep down! Yeah, I'm just mad! Then keep running. You win. Well, what did you have? It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D - Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far? Uh, wow, 700. Not 700 exactly? Yeah. Double it! What? Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1, 500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get? No way! Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it,"What were you thinking?" Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse. But umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore. What? You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you! Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving. Whoa- whoa- whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I - I - I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. Oh really? Like what Monica? Y'know she has 147, 000 pairs of boots¡¦ Oh yeah, good start Mon. She lets you borrow them. Yeah and you stretch ¡®em out with your big old clown feet. Do you wanna live outside? Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like. What else? When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. Yeah, I do. I - I do, do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler... She was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! Oh, it's gonna be fine. Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun! But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler. Oh that's right. You're still set on that? Kinda. Oh my God! Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right? Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. Hey! What's wrong? Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break... I lost $1, 500 to him in Cups! Wh - How did you lose at Cups? The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D - Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'! Oh man! And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups. All right, let's play one more hand! One more! No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In- in fact, look, there's a? I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know.. Thank you for being such a great roommate. I can't take the big white dog! You love it! It's him, not it! No, but wait? what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say. $1, 500? Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You- you're trying to give me money again! When did I try to give you money? Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay. I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss¡¦is you. And now the dog. - Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay? - Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. - Oh! I have your key. Here you go. - Thanks. Oh God!

It's not a real game! I made it up! I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square. At a fake game! Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups. Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last. No. Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time. - Okay. - Aah. Listen, I'm gonna be moving out, so you are gonna be in charge of paying the rent. - Right, and when is that due? - First of the month. And that's every month? No, just the months you actually want to live here. Ah. Okay, here's the phone bill. Oh, my God! That's our phone number.

Funny, I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Okay, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but I don't wanna live with Rachel anymore. BOTH: What? - You're just so mean to each other. And I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel. I still like you. Well, Phoebe, that's fine because I'm not moving. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Phoebe, you gotta take her. You know, I know I said some bad stuff but Rachel does have some qualities that make her a good roommate. Oh, really? Like what, Monica? You know how she has 147,000 pair of boots? Oh, yeah, good start, Mon. - She lets you borrow them. - Yeah. And you stretch them out with your big old clown feet. Do you wanna live outside? Because it's getting cold. She gets tons of catalogs and, um, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks I'd like. - What else? - Uh... When I take a shower she leaves me little notes on the mirror. Yeah, I do. I do do that. That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. When I fall asleep on the couch after reading she covers me over with a blanket. Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold. And when I told her I was gonna be moving in with Chandler she was really supportive. [SOBBING] You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy! It's gonna be fine. Okay, Rachel. Now I can't wait to live with you. You know what we should do? Bring Monica, and then we can all live there together. We'll have so much fun! But, honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler. Oh, that's right. You're still set on that? Kind of. Oh, my God. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Hey, Mon. How's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right... Oh, my God. Get your head out of your shirt there, son. What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack. Hey. - What's wrong? - Ross and I were helping the girls pack took a little break. I lost $1500 to him in Cups. Wha...? How did you lose at Cups? The same way you lost. I started out with the king and the queen. Bam. Ross gets a two and a three. Then I get a jack and a king. Boom. Ross gets a four and five. Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup the sitting-down bonus. Meanwhile, I didn't even get a half cup. Nothing. Oh, man. He never played before either. You know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups. Let's just play one more hand. One more hand. No, no more. I cannot lose another dime. I'm serious this time. In fact, look. There's... I wanna give you something, okay? And let me give it to you now before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big, white dog as a... Kind of a thank-you for being such a great roommate. I can't take the big, white dog. You love it. It's "him." Not "it." Well, what if I bought it from you, you know? And then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price. Say $1500? Wait a second. I see what you're trying to do here. You're trying to give me money again. When did I try to give you money? Before, over there with the bills. You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it. Okay, then we had a nice last night together. We had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money. Now, out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again. I'm just trying to help you out, okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay. I will be okay. Look, Chandler. You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself, okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing I'm gonna miss is you. And now the dog. MONICA: Hey. - Call me when you get there, okay? - Okay. I'm really gonna miss you. Oh, I have your key. - Here you go. - Thanks. Oh, God, this is silly. I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours. Bye, house. [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Bye-bye. - Bye. Hey. - She really left. - I know. - Thank you. - No problem, roomie. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. What the hell is that dog doing here? I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money. - And now you want that money back? - Exactly. Chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game. I made it up. I'm sorry you lost your money. But I won it fair and square. At a fake game! Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you. I am very good at Cups. Okay, now, I assume the saucer card came up when you played last? - No. - Hmm. Let's see if it comes up this time. [English - US - SDH] Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent. Right! And when is that due? - First of the month. - And that's every month? No, just the months you actually want to live here. Okay, here is the phone bill. Oh my God! That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing. So why don't I just? why don't I just cover you for a while? No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity. ...anymore. - It's not charity, Joe... - No! Forget it! Okay? I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on. Okay uh, here's the electric bill. -This is how much we pay for electric? ! -Uh, yeah. So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then? So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment? No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it. Well, how much do you think he needs? I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride. Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want. Well that would help the pride thing. Hey! Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow? -Okay. -Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight? Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel... We thought we'd go out to dinner. And celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe. And also, my birthday. It's not your birthday. What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday! -Hey! -Hey! Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night? Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing. Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it. I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist. I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist! -Pheebs, I was wondering... -You're not dressed yet? ! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes! Well and clearly not a minute sooner. Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed. Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight. My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place. Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you. Yeah, yeah, I know. Well, what you're wearing is fine for that. Rachel, I need to borrow? You're not packed! You're not packed even a little bit! Surprise! What? No, no don't get mad because look? this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized. "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night. Ta-da! I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe? I have plans. - You're plans were with us. - That's right. All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out! Okay. Oh my God, thank you! Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves! Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with... Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey. I thought you said you were going to do nothing. Yes, but for the last time. - Okay fine, now Ross... - Oh, but-but I can't do it. Why not? I've got Ben. Because, because I've got Ben. It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he? He's at a dinner party. Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment! Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am? All right, sorry. say. Spears has dark and cloudy eyes. Forget I said that. I never said that. Jared Cooper. No one heard the gunshots? The UNI says all the neighbours heard was loud music. - So who called it in? - Ted Bundy. - "Ted Bundy"? - Next-door neighbour's pug. It wouldn't stop barking. Dog's owner took the hint and called 911 after no one answered the door this morning. And... Where's Stacy Cooper? Mixed martial arts meets... newlywed chic. They look happy. So, Jared pulls out the gun, Stacy runs in through here, probably trying to make her way to the back door, through there. Jared fires once, misses. Uh... then... Don't think about the kinetics, Martin. Who are they? What was their relationship like? Why did this happen? She's not wearing a wedding ring. Possible marriage problems. Good. And? Stacy's pay stubs: Two jobs. Maybe they argued about money. Stacy's been supporting Jared's fight career. It's been killing her. Everything's always about him. When is she going to get a chance to work on herself? Jared gets mad, defensive, promises to make a change. Stacy: no, she's done. It's over. When the pleading's not working, then he threatens her. Pulls out the gun... Jared's a fighter. Why wouldn't he just kick the crap out of her? She pulled the gun out on him. He took it from her, then shot her? And being filled with remorse and realizing that he loves her, he walks back into the other room, is surrounded by the detritus of his life. (She snaps her fingers.) Shoots himself in the head. Beauty and the beast, the version you don't want to tell your kids. Thank you. Found Stacy's mother in Newfoundland. Help me out, here, Spears: What's the attraction of watching two people kicking and punching each other into a pulpy mess? Give me one good reason why MMA shouldn't be banned. Ban MMA? Might as well ban hockey or football. - That's ridiculous. - It's a sport, Ingrid. Not a crime. A sport where the intent is to draw blood and break bones? There's no intent to injury in hockey. Are we watching the same games? How do you think it's going in there? A father's worst nightmare. Were you and your son close, Mr. Cooper? Mr. Cooper. Close? I don't know. We weren't talkers, exactly. (sigh) Did Jared and Stacy have any marital issues that you know of? Yeah, they had their problems. Sure. Jared was training and training's expensive. He quit his job in the body shop to fight full time. Stacy was trying to manage his career. Worked two jobs. Sounds like a pretty stressful situation. - She surprised me. - What do you mean? I thought, you know, not much there, except a nice set of... She straightened him out. How so? Jared grew up watching me fight. He slept in a few dressing rooms. He had his diapers changed by ring girls. He was a pretty angry kid. When was the last time you talked to your son? (short pause) After his last fight. Did he seem depressed at all? Did he talk about harming himself in any way? No. I was trying to give him some advice. He didn't care much for what I had to say. I told him he was slow, his injuries were catching up with him. I told him he was lazy. He wasn't. I don't know why I said that. - Does he have any other family? - No. - Mother? - Long gone. You're going to do an investigation, right? - That's why we're here. - When you find who did it, let me have a crack at him before you lock him up. - Mr. Cooper... - Jared was a lot of things, but he didn't kill that girl or himself. You may have to prepare yourself for the possibility that your son wasn't exactly who you thought he was. Yeah. We'll keep you posted of any developments in the case. (cell phone ringing) Martin, could you see Mr. Cooper out, please? Of course. (cell phone ringing) (sigh) Danny. Hey! So, Margie Reynolds has priors. Murder? Break and enter? She smuggled fruit back from Florida, what? Apparently, she's making a habit of throwing rocks at cars. Been charged twice with mischief, once with vandalism for keying a car. I only went back five years. - Does she have a lawyer? - She wants to represent herself. - And you let her? - We barely know this woman. - Where is she? - She's in holding. Jess, don't make her your little project, OK? I got to go. OK. Fair warning. As my arresting officer, I intend to tear you apart on the stand. - You can't represent yourself. - Why not? You have three convictions. You're going to have to shoot your way out of the courtroom if you don't want to go to jail. I'll get bail and the system will lose track of me...because I'm old. Are you retired? I play piano. You know, recitals, dance classes, malls. Don't like the malls much, but... Is there anyone you can call? I've had four husbands, but not one of them would want to pick me up. You know, three, you can blame the man. Four, you got to start thinking it's you. Any kids? Now, how many husbands have you had? What number are you on? - Three. - Whoa! Only got one more in you. Best before date kind of creeps up, though. You know, better make the change soon before you become invisible. - Let me get you a lawyer. - I don't want a lawyer! Just drop the charges and give me a ride home! Well, I can't... (Her cell phone vibrates.) An old lady should be able to cross the street without fearing for her life. I have to... OK. Let me see what I can do. Great, thanks! I'll just wait here. - What's going on in there? - Personal project. What's up? Preliminary autopsy report. No recreational drugs, but Jared was juiced. - Steroids. Side effect: rage. Ah, for the days of a multivitamin and a good inight's sleep. I don't remember the last time I had a root beer. (sigh) I train at the same gym as Jared Cooper. What? I started training in MMA techniques a while back. I needed to shake things up, so I started... Fight crime with your bare hands? What else did the report say? Jared had two broken knuckles and a recently torn ligament in his shooting hand. There is no way he could have pulled the trigger at that angle. - Jared's father called it. - It's a double murder. The gym thing. I can recuse myself from the case. Did you know Jared Cooper? - Saw him around a bit, but... - What about Stacy? - No. - It's all good. Jess. No one there knows I'm a cop. Well, that's about to change. Don't worry, Spears: Change, it's a good thing! So if Stacy and Jared were murdered, first question: who was the primary target? Stacy was shot in the back, trying to run away. She had no priors, no known criminal connections. Jared's bullet wound was a clear and deliberate killing path. No struggling, no flinching. - He didn't see it coming. - Or he know it was coming and just accepted his fate. Which means it was either an execution or a friend. Or an execution by a friend. - Jared was our primary target. - And Stacy came home at the wrong time. And the killer staged it to look like a murder suicide. The MMA fight scene's littered with gangs: it could be connected. Get Ident to take apart the gun, do a DNA swab in the parts and the bullet casings. Maybe the shooter left something behind. Uh, Stacy's most recent phone calls were to a Clover Harcourt. Clover? That's a nice name. We called and sent unis over to her place, but she hasn't been home. - OK. Let's drill down on Jared Cooper: who were his friends, his enemies, both inside and outside the ring. - Cage. - Oh! Cage. Spears, check out Jared's gym. You know where it is, right? Martin, Ingrid: Head back to the house, have another look around. - What are you going to do? - Floss. After that, I have to deal with a... (Sighing): A personal project. I already gave you a statement. I want your permission now as the prosecution to drop the charges. - No way! - She's a lonely, old woman. ...Who's a danger to society. OK. What if it were your mother? I'd throw rocks right back at her. It took me four years to save up and buy that car. - I know. - Now, there are chips in it. In the paint. I know. - It's going to oxidize. - What? It's going to rust. Those chips turn to rust. You know, rust! OK! So that's why you want to throw an old woman in jail? Rust? She assaulted me. OK, Carmen: you really want to go through a whole court care? Because the law favours pedestrians over cars. And juries love little old ladies. Which is ageism: Totally unfair! OK. What if I bring Miss Reynolds here and she apologizes? Would that do it? Whatever - This part depresses me. - What's that? Opening fridges at crime scenes. Forgotten food in the crisper, jar of milk, fresh vegetables that will never get cooked. Busy girl: Workout, jobs, meetings. Pff! Premix protein shakes, soy milk. Now, what are you? Broken. Look at this curious thing. What do you suppose that is? It's a... an airbag. Put your hand on the bicep, put the hand behind the head. Then, basically, you just break the neck. - Billy, you got a minute? - You get laid off or something? - No. - Never seen you here in the middle of the day. You're a narc? Major crimes task force. I need you to open up Jared Cooper's locker for me.. I'll get the clippers. Why? Why should I apologize? Because you don't want to go to jail. - Says who? - Margie! Would you apologize? - Probably not. - Didn't think so. - Yeah, but I wouldn't get caught, either. - Ha! (short pause) Yeah, I hate prison. OK, I'll say I'm sorry. Good. I'll get Danny to take you out there. I'd love to ride around with him! (snorting) Uh, why are you doing this? I'm just like, you know, some old lady. Whose daughter was hit and killed by a car. At a crosswalk. I checked back in the system. Why didn't you say something? Talking doesn't help. - Throwing rocks does? - And music. So you... you have no kids? (short pause) No. But you have your work and a very handsome husband. Still lonely sometimes though, huh? Yeah. Guys, clear out. Here it is. You're investigating Jared's murder. Heard it all over the news. - Did you ever spar with him? - Yeah. Kicked my ass. When was the last time you saw him? Last week. Did he say or do anything unusual? Talked to us about his last fight. That's about it. I thought you were here about those pills. What pills? (Spears clears his throat.) You tell me you're a cop upfront before you join my club, cool. You don't tell me, I and everyone else will figure that you're undercover. Not cool. I'm just a guy trying to learn a few new moves. Excuse me. Yeah, well. Watch your back next time you step into the cage. Billy. Mr. Cooper. Sorry about... you know. I heard the news. Jared said... He said he did some work for someone, like doing some things on the side. Yeah, I don't know. It's just... Who was he working for? Go home, Mr. Cooper. Help me out here, man. Who was it? What's his name? No... Mr. Cooper! Hey. (shouting) What's your problem, huh? Wanna mess with me? Hey! Hey! Break it up! What do you think you're doing, huh? - Self-defence, man. It was just self-defence. He killed my son! He killed my son! Stay there. I sat in that chair right there and told you he was murdered, but you didn't listen! - Mr. Cooper! - As soon as we got the autopsy results, we shifted the investigation. Yeah, but I knew. I knew. Here. Tell us about Aaron Dixon. - Aaron Dixon? That's his name? - What happened at the gym? Jared said he worked for... he did some work for some gang banger he met at the dog pound. - What kind of work? - Mr. Cooper. Stacy was doing too much already. Jared said he just wanted to make some dough fast to help out. Dixon did it, you know that, right? - What kind of work was your son doing for him? - I don't know. Whatever it was... Stace made him quit. Sarah said that Dixon was really pissed. Aaron Dixon's been up on weapons charges twice, one conviction. Calls his crew the North Side Boys. They have a reputation for gun violence. And we know his crew spends a lot of time at the dog pound. Find anything in Jared's locker when you were there? Nothing. [Sultrily]: Of all the gyms in the city, Spears, you join that one. I train and I leave, that's it. And you ignore the gangsters and the drugs. When I run into some kid on a call, and I'll be ready. It's a new world out there. - So those 8 minutes in the ring... - Cage. - Whatever. That's your fountain of youth? You should try a spa. - Hey, boss. - How'd it go at the house? - We kyboshed. We came up with nothing new. But we got some air bags. Jared and Stacy own the car, but all the air bags are still in place. So, what? Jared was selling black market air bags for Dixon? - You can get $1,500 a pop for some models. - Call Robbery and see if they know anything that can help us out. Where are we at with finding Stacy's friend, Clover? Nothing yet. Look harder. She disappeared after the murders, that might say something. Somebody just tried to kill me, and you're acting like I'm guilty? I didn't have to come here. I appreciate it very much. It's all right. The old man? He's pretty messed up. Seemed to connect pretty good. Yeah, Jared said his pops had fast hands back in the day. - So you knew Jared Cooper? - Yeah, man. Everyone at the gym knew Jared. He was a fierce man. His father seems to think that Jared was working for you. Nah. Jared was all about the ring. Didn't have time to work for me. So why would his father say something like that? You'll have to ask him. - Could someone confirm your whereabouts last night? - Yeah, I got my crew. We were at my place, watching the fights. - Did you know Stacy Cooper, Jared's wife? - Yeah, man. She was cool. She used to be a ring girl, right? Jared lucked out with that one. Sad about her, too. Do you recognize these? Nah. Is that some kind of parachute or what? Hey, you got an extra pole and a hat? - What? - If you're just fishing, I need my own fishing rod and cap. You know, keep the sun out my eyes. Can I go? How'd it go with Margie today? (He laughs.) Fine. She, uh... She seemed genuinely sorry that she chipped the paint on the car. So... Hey, uh... What's the word in Homicide? Not good. Graci's pretty peeved. Hm. You think he'll be cleaning house or...? - Do you wanna make a move? - I just... If a spot opens up, I mean, why not? It would be pretty difficult if we had a kid, both of us working 24/7. Right. Well, I didn't... See, I didn't know that was still possibly a plan, Jess. - I've been thinking about adoption. - What? - Wait, wait. There's Graci. - No, can... When any individual intentionally misleads the court, it does tremendous damage to our justice system. Perjury... - Why is this so difficult to talk about? - I don't know. Well, maybe that's what needs to change. Maybe we'll be okay without kids, wandering the streets alone... You are not alone. And Margie is only alone because she's crazy. I like her coat. Those deep pockets? You could stash 3 pairs of shoes and a change of clothes in those things. (He laughs.) Hey, uh... How long have you been thinking about adoption? - Stash box. - What? The air bags. Jared was building stash boxes. What? Where's my mug? That's the work he was doing with Dixon. He was removing air bags, installing dummy gas tanks, customizing the cars so that... So Dixon and his boys could smuggle... Drugs, guns, whatever. If Jared built all of Dixon's stash boxes, then he would know all of Dixon's hiding places. And if he just up and left, then Dixon wouldn't necessarily love the idea that he was walking out with company secrets. Dixon had Jared killed and made it look like a suicide. - How are we gonna prove that? - We start by looking in all of Dixon's hiding places. ♪ So, how's about we bring Aaron Dixon back in? We found these pills all tucked away safe and sound in your 4x... - I don't know who put those there, but... - You put them there, Aaron. In the stash boxes that Jared Cooper built. It's just 'roids, man. You might as well arrest me for drinking beer on a sidewalk. We checked your crew's cars too, found more HGH and a gun. Caron, the guy with the gun? You can't stop that guy from talking. - Nothing to do with me. - Not true. Got you for importation of a controlled substance... 1 to 5 years for a first of fence. Given your record, I can do a lot more. You're one of those overachieving types, I guess. The higher the heel, the happier I am. So Jared, what? He tried to blackmail you or he just wanted out? Making up another one of your stories? I think you killed Jared. And Stacy, she just came home at the wrong time. - Uh-uh. I didn't commit no murders, lady. - Lately? Lady. I said lady. It's all gonna start to unravel, Aaron, you know that. First your crew rolls you on the steroids, then they finger you on the murders of Stacy and Jared Cooper? It's just a matter of time. If I give you a hot tip, like a really smoking hot piece of social media information, maybe you and I could do a deal. - I don't deal with murderers. - That's the thing. I didn't do these things that you accuse me of... but I might know someone who knows someone who did. - I'm gonna need more than that. - What's my deal? Plead to the drug charge, I recommend 2 years less a day. Nope. Conditional discharge probation. I get to throw you back in for hard time if you lie to me or misbehave. Misbehave? Mmm! You going all hot schoolteacher on me now? You got 10 seconds. You're looking for Clover, right? - Stacy's friend? - I know where you can find her. - And how would that help me? - 'Cause she asked me to protect her. Protect her from who? Somebody trying to kill her. - How's your plumbing problem? - What? Twisted something? All good, no leaks? Was it your back, your shoulder? - Who is it? - Aaron Dixon sent us. Clover? You need to come with us. Yeah. Yeah. Stacy and me, we... we met when we were both ring girls. This one day at an event, they tell us they want us to wear just body paint, nothing else. That was that. I decided to train myself, took up women's boxing. But Stacy and me, we stayed friends. How would you describe Jared and Stacy's relationship? Uh, good. I guess. You guess? They were... Stacy had to manage more than Jared's career, you know, he... He was pretty up and down. Aaron Dixon told us that you needed protection. I guess, yeah. From who? Clover, two people have been murdered. You need to tell me what's going on. Jared was nice. I mean scary, right, in the cage, but... sweet. You and Jared were sleeping together? Yeah. - When was the last time you saw him? - A few days ago. And Stacy was your best friend? Yeah. Clover, do you know who killed Jared and Stacy? Little Billy. He found out about me and Jared. He got pretty pissed off. He said he was gonna lay some hurt down on him. He was gonna kill him. Are you afraid he's gonna hurt you? He said he was gonna kill me. William Ridge, otherwise known as Little Billy, MMA trainer at the dog pound. You know him? - We sparred a few times. He's got a pretty long sheet: Sale of cocaine, ss a bad temper. There's an old restraining order: he assaulted a pregnant girlfriend 3 years ago. - And you got to hit him. - If I knew about this, I would've hit him harder. Where's Clover now? Protective custody. You think Little Billy could've done it? - Yeah. You? - With a name like Little Billy, he's gotta be guilty of something. So how did he do it? Were Little Billy and Jared even friends? They sparred once in a while. Not sure if they ever hung out. - Billy would've had to have gone over to Jared's house. - Steroids. - What about them? - Little Billy deals them out of the club for Dixon. - Jared was juiced. - Little Billy made a home delivery. - That would get him inside. - And Jerry wouldn't see it coming. OK, let's go with that. Spears, get back over to the dog pound to see... Hang on. Danny. Yeah? We didn't find any steroids at Jared's house. She what? I know, but I... Jared built stash boxes for everyone else; Maybe Jared built a stash box for himself. I'm on my way down. No, yeah. I think I know who it is. You guys head back over to the house and see if you can find where Jared stashed his little green pills. Spears, we got trace DNA on the unused bullets and the gun. See if you can convince Billy to give us a sample. I gotta... head downstairs and deal with an interesting crazy lady. You threw rocks at another car. No, another car almost ran me over. Cause and effect. - I went to bat for you. - I didn't ask you to. - So you do want to go to jail. - No. Then why? You need to stop, Margie. Maybe I wanted to get to know you better. - You have my card, you could have called. - I was just kidding. - Let me get a lawyer for you. - I got smarts, I got money for my own bail. What about you? What? You got a way to bail yourself out? - I'm not... - Maybe you should. Wow, I'm really confused. What are we talking about here? - Do you really wanna know? - Yes, please. - You. You need to breathe. Should we step into my office? (electronic signal) Thanks. - Every fighter needs his bag of frozen peas, right? - Mm-hmm? Ice cubes to make your shakes. Freezer's broken. OK, so those are steroids. But how do we know Little Billy delivered them the night of the murder? Dixon said there was a brand new shipment. Billy must've delivered them that night. Billy! Detective sergeant Spears. I need to ask you a few more questions. - You wanna talk, step in the cage. - Let's go, get out. What you gonna do, shoot me? You're a person of interest in a murder case. Let's go. You step up, and I answer every question and talk as long as you want. You don't, I lawyer up and you never get the answers you're looking for. You want something from me, huh? Come and get it. There are easier ways to get a suspect's DNA, but... they're not as much fun. (rap music) Should we let him shower before we bring him in? (panting) Yeah, really appreciate you cooperating with us to help us nail down the guy who killed Jared and Stacy Cooper. So you know who it was, huh? - How well do you know Aaron Dixon? - I see him at the club. - Yeah, we think Dixon did the murders. - Nothing surprises me. Dixon, he's trying to box you in for the murders. Yeah, I know. He sent us to, uh... Clover Harcourt? And she said that you and her had a thing... Clover? Never nothing serious. We're both... free agents. Hmm. I just gotta tie up a few loose ends here. (She clears her throat.) So we got this sworn statement from Clover and she says you made death threats? I say some things in the moment, you know how you do. Uh... Clover also said that you made death threats to Jared Cooper? Yeah, well... So you did. And we know that you gave Jared Cooper steroids acquired from Dixon. We know that. Your man Spears tell you that? I mean, he would know. I sold him some, too. And you dropped the steroids off to Jared the night he and Stacy were killed. My job is hard. Murderers getting smarter all the time, no witnesses, doing a really clean job of cleaning the murder weapon... It's almost like we got nothing to go on. But... you'd be surprised how many smart murderers forget to wear gloves when they load their guns. And DNA on bullets, that's a lot to go on. I'm thinking we're gonna find your DNA on those bullets, Billy. And we've got your DNA on Detective sergeant Spears, in your blood from the fight. I'd say today's a pretty good day. You think I need this? Seriously, do you think I need this? Sir, I really... King, did you know that Spears had a relationship with this Little Billy? - It wasn't relevant, sir. - It is now. You've charged him with murder. Spears, I'm going to ask you once, did you buy steroids or any controlled or illegal substance from that man? - No. - And you'll testify under oath to that fact? - Yes, sir. - And that testimony will be truthful? - Chief, you've asked him more than once. - Yes, sir. Billy is lying, sir. - And your case is solid? - Planned and deliberate. First degree times two. Then you bury him, I need some good press. Get the hell out of here. - Jess... - You better not. (Ding! ) That was such a case... What are you going to do? Good night, girls, see you next week. (girls giggling) Ah, there she is. Hi. This is very unprofessional. I'm just a piano player, Your Honour. You should put your hair up. I should cut it all off. No, you shouldn't! I haven't done this since... well... maybe ten. Well, sometimes you need to go back to go forward. (steps approaching) Ah, David, this is Jessica King. The Detective. - Hi. - Hi. Yeah, don't get your hopes up, he just got married. - Congratulations. - Thanks. And he and Fraser are gonna be very happy as soon as Fraser gets off his fat arse and gets a job. Okay, Margie, we should... - Yes, okay, fine. - Would you like to begin? Yeah. Um, you tell anyone who I am and what I do, I'll shoot you. Okay? Seriously. ♪ (police siren) you might even laugh from it. You will say that something so strange is impossible. But this is certainly my mother's story. was a wolf-man. My mother was a student in a national university on the outskirts of Tokyo. Her scholarship covered her school fees. And for her living expenses she had a part-time job at the same time. but also on miscellaneous subjects. they had no knowledge about Areté. my mom saw my father for the first time. taking notes without a textbook on nothing but a notebook. She thought he was very different from the other students. Please wait. This is the attendance ticket. If you don't sign and turn it in you won't be marked present. So... I'm... Not a student here. What? I won't be coming again. Who's that? Please wait. but at that lecture you didn't have a textbook so I thought it would be a bit hard to study. Why don't we share mine? Welcome. It will be done by Friday. Thank you for your patronage. Sorry for the wait. Welcome. Let's be careful with this. this way. Where should I place this? here. Come in. come. and the sophist Lycon. but Anytus was the one behind the prosecution. What do you do for fun? What kind of food do you like? What kind of person do you love? Why are you called "Hana"? My name? Yeah. When I was born the cosmos flowers in the backyard were blooming. they were blooming naturally. When my father saw them he immediately thought: that won't fade away. then we'll be able to overcome almost anything. I was smiling the whole time. My relatives were all thinking "What an indiscretion". That made me really angry. But... Maybe that was an indiscretion after all... it wasn't. I'm glad. but each one is different inside. and homes with only elders. It would be nice to have a home. Saying "I'm home" when you arrive. and sit yourself comfortably on a chair. That would be great. I would build a shelf. Fill it with books and then build another shelf. your own home. And I'll say "Welcome home" when you arrive. Hana... What? There's something I must tell you... Speak your mind. The truth is... Let's do this again tomorrow. Okay. Hana... Hana. I messed up. It's something I never told anyone before. because you might leave me. I should have told you sooner. I should have shown you. Shown me? Could you close your eyes for a moment? A bit longer. Can I open them? Hana... What do I look like? and attacking people was known as just a legend. The world is full of things unknown to me. that's probably what my mother thought. Did I shock you? Should we stop meeting? But you're trembling. Are you scared? I'm not. Because it's you. that went extinct about a hundred years ago. The last being that inherited a blood mix of humans and wolves. the history of their family's destruction. and died after. faced many troubles and grew up into an adult. He got a driver's license and moved to the city to look for a job. and had no one to look back on. Until that point he had taken care to live in secret and in hiding. That's what my father said. Gentle to Heart and Body Natural Birth Mom gave birth to me in that small apartment. It was a snowy day. only by themselves... the doctors would be shocked. I'm glad she was born safely. But things are just starting now. Will she grow to be a gentle child? She will probably be a very smart kid. I wonder what kind of adult she'll be. I want her to work on whatever she likes. to become a happy and healthy child. We'll watch over her until she grows up. Yeah. My little brother was born in the spring of the following year. It was a rainy day. my father had disappeared. I don't know... what my father was thinking that day. It was probably the instinct of hunting food for the baby at work. something nutritious to eat. [TN: That's a driving license] I leave the children in your care. My mother heard it like he said that. Leave it to me. I'll raise them well. After that I don't remember my mother ever thinking about anything serious. Rice! Yuki. Rice! Just a bit more. Rice! Yuki! She said that whenever I got angry and grumbled my fur would grow out and I would turn into a wolf. I guess it can't be helped. Have a biscuit before lunch. crying out and searching for food from morning until night. I was very different from my brother who ate little and was weak. My mother took a suspension from college to raise us. She also had to quit her part time job. That was close. The small savings my father left us were enough to sustain our living. That was close. she was wondering whether to have us live as humans or wolves. She was at a loss over it. Oh my. so she had to study everything by herself in books. she had to breastfeed for two whole hours. Whenever her breast didn't produce milk she used skim milk instead. Living with Wolves she stayed up all night holding him and caressing his back. Because of that my mother would always be dozing off once in a while. It's alright. even if she just closed her eyes for a short moment. Mommy. What? The problem was when we got sick. Yuki? Yuki? Yuki! She was conflicted between going to the pediatrics or the vets... My child ended up eating drying agent by mistake. She is two years old. she vomited. There was no blood in it. It has "Silica Gel" written on it. But... Are there any complications? Huh? Her appetite? I'm hungry. I see... It's alright... My mother regrets never asking how my father was raised when he was a kid. Walk. that's... Walk! You've been in bad health the past few days. So we... WALK! I get it. Gee... hide your ears. let's go for a walk. But watch your ears! They are showing again! Okay! Good afternoon. How cute. he called you cute. S- sorry. No... But that wasn't the only problem. What time do you think it is? Stop with the noise! I'm so sorry. for crying out loud! I'm truly sorry for this. Teach them some discipline! there. It's alright. It's written in the lease that pets are prohibited in the apartment. We don't have any. Don't lie. We'll find out about it. you're more than welcome to go someplace else you prefer. From the child consultation center? the neighbors are worried the children are in peril. What do you mean? Our research shows your children never had a medical checkup did they? It's alright. They are healthy. we would at least like to take a look at them. that's... It's just for a second. It is just to confirm what you are saying is true. T- that's not possible. we'll have no choice but to suspect you of ill-treatment and neglect. Please go away! Slooow! Hey. mom? What do you want from now on? or wolves? to someplace you can choose whatever you want. We'll start with the vacant houses by the town hall. but they don't stay long. there isn't much around here. it's a two and a half hour one-way bus and train ride. A round trip is five hours! Even if you say you want to raise your kids in a good environment... I'd say the city is a much more convenient place. It's huge... the price for repairs would be insane. Since it's an abandoned house... it's okay to keep your shoes on. This place is practically dilapidated. But at least the electricity still works. And the stream water hasn't dried up. And the things from the shed are also okay to use. right? this place is not suited for self-sufficiency. Animals come down from the mountain and damage the fields. they'd just eat them all. The houses in this area became empty because the humans around here were driven out by them. So the neighborhood? Neighborhood? No one ever comes down so you won't see them. Would you like to see someplace else? Around the village would be more practical... I'll take it. What? I'm taking this house. Why? Where are we? Our new house. It's slanting! ants! What is this? ! Step! Step! Help! So? Do you guys like it? I like it! Let's go back. She wanted someplace where there was nobody living around. She was a bit eccentric. And her husband? Who knows. Any income? Who knows. So how does she plan on providing for her and her children? Gramps Nirasaki! Please be gentle on them this time! 3... 2... look! Come down. Come down. Here. come. Here. Age 4 Age 5 Thank you very much. Come again. Good evening. Good evening. come here. Is that the woman from the rumors? From now on I'll have to start saving as much as possible. S-a-v-i-n-g? That means we will have to do things like planting our own vegetables. too! okay? Okay. I'll take these. Sure. Those too. Yuki! Yuki and Ame being wolf children is our little secret. Yeah. everyone would be shocked. That's why they could never turn into wolves in front of other people. Right? It's our promise. Got it. One more thing. don't be arrogant with them. Why? Because that would make you father sad. Right? You get it? We get it! We won't forgive you!" said the very angry villagers as they chased the wolf with their guns. I'm sorry! I won't do it anymore" cried the boasting wolf while running away. Why? Why indeed? Hey! Excuse me. Huh? May I take the fallen leaves from the woods? What? The fallen leaves. You don't have to ask anybody to take those. Thank you very much. How long will she keep it up? She has been quite the talk around the convenience store and the karaoke place. I don't doubt it. This time for sure. Mom... Ame! What happened? A tortoiseshell cat. it had its eyes on him since he's weak. Those are just scratches. They are nothing You won't survive with those! Yuki. Will you comfort me? You will be alright. You sure will. not even for a boar! You saw a boar? I did! I also saw a monkey and a wild goat. But I wasn't scared at all! It was fun when I started chasing them and they ran away! Also- Yuki. when I peed... you can't be self-important around other animals. But... Please. Okaaay. Thank you. Can you comfort me again? it's fine. But surely... How does a wolf child become an adult? Yuki! Wait. Pick me up. Already? You're slow. Hurry up! Wolves start hunting only four months after they are born. First they start with small game like rats. they team up with adult wolves and... TEAM! No way... I didn't want to anyway. Don't go too far away. Sure. let's go back? Ame. Do you think we can eat this plant? Hm... Got it! Caught it! look Ame. It's alright. It will be fine. look! It's a great cormorant. There's a stream on the other side and... Mom... Why are wolves always the bad guys? Is it because... of that picture book? Everyone hates him and he gets killed at the end. That's why I... I hate being a wolf. I see. But... Your mother loves wolves. even if just by herself. Moom. Mooom. What happened? They are withering again. A disease? In all of them? No way... Mom. What's going to happen to us now? It's no use. Your mother still has to study much more. Will you help me again? I will. Thank you. Get inside. Sure. Good evening. but with all the commotion... right? Even though I did everything in the books it just ends up failing. isn't it? Full of nature. What's so natural? will it? it's always the same. Isn't that what you were thinking? T- that's... Don't smile. Why are you smiling? Smiling won't do anything about it. That man is scary. No. I don't know how to do this and I'm hopeless. Even though you're an adult? I regret not asking your father about more various things. This is bad. So bad. Good afternoon. Um.... Here. This is to you. What is it? Seed potato. And you plant these in the fields? You can use it to do many more things. but don't worry. That's just his personality. that was my fault. Good afternoon! I'm sorry. It's alright. Here. Old man Nirasaki. Thank you for the seed potatoes. Do you plan to let them go to waste? Start over from the earth. You can't dig like that. I'm sorry. Er... What about fertilizers? Did you bury the dry leaves there? Yes. Then you don't need it. work the soil up here too. It doesn't need to go that far. It's just for me and my two children to eat. Didn't you hear me? I did. Create the rows. Yes. Leave more space between them. Yes. make them higher. Yes. plant the cut part facing down. just leave them. Um... Thanks for teaching me so much... are you okay? Good afternoon. Come here. Huh? just come here. Hm? come on. you. Yes? Those are chamomile and cabbage. it will make a taste bugs don't like. don't! Celery is much better with cabbage. Not it isn't. For beginners this is better. no. Is chamomile even gonna fill anyone's stomach? not deep. You're wrong. You first need to soak the hole with water. no. you need to plant first. wrong. You can sprinkle the fertilizer this way. If you add too much the insects will flock here. No. Give me that. Be more daring with it. Wrong. You need to add just a bit. You will definitely go wrong if you follow his advice. That's your advice! What? Vinegar wood polish? It's made from charcoal-roasted smoke. Then then treated poultry manure is added to it. Thanks for everything. thank you. Sorry for intruding so inadvertently and surprising you. no. It must have been hard to work a land so raw. so I had to study everyday. but they always gave up and went back soon after. Were there others as young as me? they were old men who had retired. It's funny how mental and weak they were. this is no land that makes living off it easy. The drainage is bad. There's a ton of snow. We have to help each other. We thought you weren't one to socialize with your neighbors. There aren't many young mothers around here. So it's really reassuring to have one more of us here. Ask anything you want. then... What? You live off your savings? ! but they will soon run out. It's hard to find a job. Everyone leaves their children at the nursery school and goes far away to work. What kind of place is a "nursery school"? Why don't Yuki and Ame go there? That's because... Yuki wants to go to the nursery school! No way. I will go! No way! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will! I will... I'LL GO! I want to! I want to! I want to! I want to! hurry up and eat your food. I know it's about our secret. But I'll be careful. But you see... I'll be careful. Y - Yuki... do you own a dog? err... Well... Isn't that a wolf? darling! It's a wolf! that's not... there are no more wolves in Japan. That's a shepherd mix. Hana-chan? Ain't I right? ain't I? What? The dog is gone. good afternoon. Yuki-chan. Aren't you sociable today? Your clothes are just like your dog's. Isn't she cute? Y - Yuki... Hana-chan? Hello! Hello! I wonder where grandpa Nirasaki is... They were grown quite nicely. It's thanks to everyone's help. so this will be very helpful. What do you mean damaged? A boar. take these. This much! ? Those boars... I'll thankfully accept these. he dug everything up. It seems that this year he even went as far as going to Sakei's rice field. this is in exchange. It's heavy. Hana-chan's field was the only one that the animals didn't damage. That's a miracle on this mountain. Maybe there's a trick to it? I didn't do anything. We would all like to hear it. What does "trick" mean? Pee! that Yuki-chan. By any chance... What? No... It's nothing. Thank you very much. It's okay. It's in exchange for the potatoes. It has been a long time since we had any eggs. That's good to hear. Tell me if you run out of them. Oh. That's SO cute. Huh? Huh? But that's so big. I can't take it. It's alright. Don't mention it. It's from a guy who had it sitting in his shed. but... Take it. Besides if we take it back the old man would be angry at us. Old man"? it's getting old. He is totally in love with you. He's over 90. he gets everyone involved... You idiot! You shouldn't be saying things like that. So that's it... I finally understand the reason why the field had to be bigger. I don't like it. Huh? Why are you always smiling like that? Don't laugh! What's so funny about it? Even though I moved here to escape from people's eyes... I ended up getting a lot of help from everyone at the village. but somehow it seems like I can keep on going. Cool! M- mo- mom! Ame! Ame is-! M- mom! Ame! Ame! Ame! Ame! M- o- mom... Ame! Mom... Ame... Ame! Ame! Ame! Open your eyes! Ame! Ame! Ame! Open your eyes... Ame... Mom... It hurts... Ame! I found a crested kingfisher. It was a really beautiful crested kingfisher. Today even I felt like catching one myself. You know what? It was totally different from before. I wasn't scared. I felt like I could do anything for a moment there. And then... Why are you crying? What are we doing here? Later my mother said that she had never been so scared in her life. turned into someone completely different. it was inevitable. I started following every single order to the full extent. I could go. However... No matter what happens... I won't become a wolf! I know that already. It's a promise. I can manage it. three octopuses". What's that? It's a good luck charm so you don't become a wolf. Good luck charm? three octopuses". Three.. three octopuses. three octopuses". three octopuses". three octopuses". Hurry up! three octopuses". three octopuses". three octopuses". It was the first time in my life I was surrounded by so many people. when I got there I was unsure if I could actually do it. But that was only at the start. I'm leaving. See you! take care. Yeah. Shino-chan! Good morning. Yuki-chan. I saved you your seat. Thank you. First Grade who knows the answer to this? Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! no running! Yuki-chan! do your best! You're fast. Amazing Yuki-chan. Only you could do that! Thank you very much. Good luck. Thanks for waiting. Job offers – Part-time That is... The nature observatory of the Niikawa's forest is looking for an assistant researcher. Historic village's nature Sorry to keep you waiting. Shall we go? Tendo. Welcome to Niikawa's forest nature observatory. Thanks for welcoming us here. and preserve the wild life. These three pillars are what we ask of volunteers while they're here. a specialist must be simultaneously proficient in all of them. we are taking applications for an assistant to the busy nature observers. That is indeed the case. though. but the study required for that and training expenses are the only implications. The hourly wage of a part-time high school student is best suited for you. Even so... Do you want the job? Er... I heard you keep a wolf here... It's a timber wolf. He is quiet. It's because of his age. could you... Excuse me for a moment. Nice to meet you. I came here because there's something I'd like to ask you. This boy is the son of a wolf. His wolf father passed away. but I don't know how to raise a wolf child. What did you do to become an adult wolf? Won't you tell me about the time you were raised in the woods? sorry about that. A wealthy person got special permission to acquire and raise him. so they brought him to us. Although he was originally born at a zoo in Moscow. He isn't a wild animal? It's rare to see wild wolves at zoos. it's taken as a foster child. we take in hurt wild birds and raccoon dogs. After that we deal with healing them. but will you be okay doing it with me? about the mountains and nature. That's the first time I saw a real one. A wolf? Was dad like that? No. Not at all. Good. Why? Because that guy looked very lonely. I wanted to meet my dad. too. I underwent a big impact. yours looks great. Keno-chan. I found a four-leafed clover. Me too! Yuki-chan! Did you find anything? Yeah. Look! Just for fun I caught a rat snake and wrapped it around my arm but there were no girls like me in school. this is my mother's jewelry. So pretty! She got this one on her last birthday. How nice. show us your treasure chest! Sure! what is inside? Look. There were no other girls who would happily gather small animal bones and reptile dry skins besides me. I realized. I was so embarrassed that it got me anxious. I reached a decision: From now on I would act as graceful and girly as I could. Don't laugh! I'm troubled with all seriousness! Yuki. I don't want people to think I'm a weirdo. I guess I'll have to help you. I remember I got really happy that my mother started sewing a new dress just for me. Because of this I stopped feeling out of place in the middle of the class. I started getting along much better with my friends. Good morning! Morning! Yuki-chan! They're wonderful! I say that this dress saved me. Next year it was really hard to get Ame to go to school. You hear? three octopuses". The school is this way! first graders! second graders! first graders! second graders! second graders! third graders. third graders! fourth graders! third graders! Good morning. Ame-kun. Is today a holiday at school? No. So you're ditching? Yeah. You can come here whenever you want. Sorry for the inconvenience. This is the research center. Here you can also see a Mountain Frog that has a tail. Hana-chan! Can you help us here? Suure! your attention. Let me introduce you the new exchange student. His name is Fujii Souhei-kun. introduce yourself. I'm Fujii. It's nice to meet you. too. do you have a pet dog? Huh? Why? you smell like a furry animal. I don't have one. Really? That's weird. I was pretty sure you did. What is it? no. It's just this smell. A smell? Of what? Maybe it's just my imagination. Which is it... it's this one! are you serious? Yuki-chan. too. Souhei-kun is really funny. I have to return this book. What's up with her? She not always like that. Hey Yuki. About that... about that... Hey Yuki! Yuki! Hey Yuki! Be honest with me! What? Did I do something to you? No you didn't. So you don't like me because I'm an exchange student? Is that it? I told you it's not that. Then why are you avoiding me? I'm not. three octopus. three octopus. Three.. Hey! Wait up! three octopuses. three octopuses. three octopuses. three octopuses. Get away! Hey you. Don't get any closer! What are you doing? ! Don't touch me! Yuki! Yuki! Hana-chan. Telephone. Thanks. Hello. I'm sorry to call you in the middle of work. Do you know how much blood he lost from his head? It was just my ear. Yuki. No matter what I ask her she doesn't say a word. Did you really hurt him? Did you apologize to him? Apologize. Apologize right now. I'm sorry. I have no excuse for what happened. Souhei-kun's mother so... And what if it had drained all the blood from my son's head? And what if by some chance he becomes deaf in that ear? What a child does is a parent's responsibility! Does taking out a loan or selling your house make up for that? ! so... And what makes you think that's the case? If you don't listen I'll have to... A wolf. It was a wolf that did it. It was a wolf that did this. Souhei. What are you talking about? Souhei... Souhei? They didn't catch the culprit. she has been different lately. Yuki-chan would never do that. It's obvious that it was her. So the teacher... What happened with Souhei-kun? He left early. How come? Because he got hurt. How did he get hurt? you see... Who hurt him? Well... Yuki-chan! Yuki-chan. I knew it. Was it really her? I'm a detective. Stop that! Quiet down! Everyone quiet down! It didn't work... The good luck charm; no matter how many times I repeated it. They... should expel me already. Will we be unable to live at that house anymore? I'm sorry... I'm sorry! Mom... I'm sorry! there. Souhei-kun? A printed paper. From Souhei-kun. From Souhei-kun. Souhei-kun. Today she went to play at Shino-chan's house. I see. Wait a minute. You must live pretty far away. Thanks for coming here everyday. I don't like that Yuki is not going to school anymore. didn't you? What did you mean by it? That was... I mean.. but... For a moment there I'm pretty sure I saw a wolf. it hurt me. That's why I said that a wolf did it. Which means it wasn't Yuki's fault. But everyone says I'm talking nonsense with that... I see... Can I ask you one more question? Do you hate wolves? Not really. Neither do I. Hey... Wanna see it? Isn't it cool? Want to touch it? Doesn't it hurt? Itches a bit. Let's go! I'm going. Where are you going? To my teacher's home. Who is your teacher? My teacher is... My teacher. I get it. Will you be okay on your own? Yeah. Take care. Sure. Don't stay out late. Sure. Where's Yuki-chan? She went back to school today. That's great. What about Ame-chan? some times not. That's also good for him. Guys who don't go to school since elementary school are very promising. Edison and I were like that. Now he is talking nonsense again. who lives up in the mountain? The mountain? I thought he meant the old man but... Let me see. Is there anyone on the mountain during this busy farming season? My teacher knows everything. Everything about the mountain. I never thought you would get along with older people... Next time bring him here. besides... My teacher doesn't meet with humans. He doesn't go down to the village like the bears and boars. But I guess he might like to meet my mother. My teacher is the master in charge of this whole mountain's territory. Thanks for always taking care of Ame. You can get in now. I want to bring Yuki to my teacher's place too. I'm improving my hunting technique. There's a trick to run at full speed in the forest. There's also a way to read the terrain. I've been studying a lot. also about territory and how to respect them. There's no way I'm going. Why? And why don't you go to school anymore? Because the mountain is much more fun. There are many things I still have to learn there. It's better not to learn those. Why? Just start going to school! No way. Why not? Because I'm a wolf. You're human. We're wolves. I decided I'm never turning into a wolf again. Why? How come? Because I'm human! Okay? I'm HUMAN! Why do you say that? why". you're a wolf. you... Shut up! You don't know anything! What? ! I'll never forgive you if you don't come to school tomorrow. I won't go! Then I won't forgive you! And I won't go! You wanna fight? What? What's that noise? Yuki! Ame! Stop it you two! Yuki! Ame! Yuki! Ame! Ame? Both Yuki and Ame started walking on their separate paths. why do I feel this uneasy? why? was full of many record-setting heavy rains.
