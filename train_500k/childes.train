[to child.] *MOT: he loves wires. *MOT: loves wires. *MOT: if you had a pile of wires and electronics remotes you know cameras iphones anything like that that's what he would would play with. *EXP: ah which books did you read today? *MOT: um we did put me in the zoo. *MOT: and what was the other...? *MOT: oh we looked at the farm one. *MOT: he does have a touchy um book on um like vehicles. *MOT: trucks and stuff. *MOT: that he like to read. *MOT: that 'll entertain him when he's in the car. *MOT: um you know he guess he likes the the feeling of them. *MOT: and put me in the zoo he just picked up and handed to me. *MOT: we don't have this one at home. *MOT: we've read it before. *MOT: but we don't have it at home. *MOT: yeah. *MOT: go ahead. *EXP: I'm sorry. *EXP: I was just gonna ask. *EXP: so um just to get the gist of it. *EXP: what do you think that um everything that he liked today had in common? *MOT: hard stuff that he could chew on. *MOT: hard or hardish. *MOT: he likes the textures. *MOT: and he likes things that make noise. *MOT: it's actually it was an idea I got last time when we were here. *MOT: there was already the little cookie in here. *MOT: and he liked rattling it back and forth. *MOT: and so we spent some time putting you know things... *MOT: and once I put the first thing in he followed my direction and was putting more stuff in. *MOT: um but he liked the rattling. *MOT: um you know rattling this stuff. *MOT: and I guess the touch of the the books. *EXP: you keep grabbing the pizza. *MOT: oh. *EXP: is that the most typical thing that he... *MOT: we don't have this at home. *MOT: but at our play group there's a... *MOT: it looks exactly like this just bigger. *MOT: piece of pizza. *MOT: it's the thing that that they all fight over. *MOT: there's only one piece. *MOT: I'm sure that there were more at some point in time. *MOT: and kids probably walked off with the other pieces. *MOT: I don't know what is so fascinating about it. *MOT: but he was playing with the pizza. *MOT: and every time he picked up some... *MOT: thank you! *MOT: would you like it back? *MOT: you cannot have the wire. [to child.] *MOT: um so no I don't know what's fas... *MOT: maybe it's the texture. *MOT: um but he was playing with it a lot. *MOT: and um yeah it's a big favorite at play group too. *MOT: ah how 'bout the baby doll? *MOT: we have a couple baby dolls at home. *MOT: they are his sister's baby dolls. *MOT: he occasionally expresses interest in them. *MOT: mainly when she is trying to play with them. *MOT: he doesn't really look at them when he's on his own. *MOT: or when she's not around. *MOT: um so um I was trying to see if he would look at it and be like *MOT: " oh look it's a baby doll!" *MOT: " you can play with it and feed it and stuff like that. " *MOT: are you upside down? [to child.] *CHI: [vocalizes] *MOT: he likes being upside down. *MOT: he'll crawl and put his head on the ground and try and do a somersault. *CHI: [vocalizes] *MOT: likes being upside down. *MOT: into climbing on everything. *MOT: yeah the daredevil. *MOT: yeah very physical. *EXP: does he play with his sister with the the baby doll? *MOT: it's generally trying to grab the baby doll and chew on her face. *MOT: or you know I think it's it's plastic. *MOT: it's it's not real hard. *CHI: [vocalizes] *MOT: you know probably felt good against his gums. *MOT: and it gives the added benefit of ah teasing her 'cause she's trying to play with it. *MOT: um yeah. *MOT: that's entertainment most days is them figuring out how to annoy the other one. *MOT: were there any differences on how he played here today and how he plays at home? *MOT: um not a lot. *MOT: at home we have more um cars and trucks. *MOT: he likes those a lot. *MOT: and things with wheels that he can move. *MOT: and we also have um a lot of little people figures. *MOT: like the Fisherprice little people. *MOT: and he likes playing with those. *MOT: ah but it's yeah trucks and little people he likes a lot. *MOT: um so you guys don't have them here. *MOT: xxx you know he might have played with them. *MOT: but yeah he doesn't have much interest in stuffed animals at home either. *MOT: and xxx interest in books. *MOT: [laughs]. *MOT: and you've got a new friend. *MOT: careful Stevie. *MOT: do not pull hair. [to child.] *MOT: do not pull hair. *MOT: be gentle. [to child.] *MOT: you've gotta be gentle. [to child.] *MOT: you do not know your own strength. *EXP: good listening. *EXP: look at you. *EXP: that's sweet. [to child.] *EXP: how 'bout across the visits? *EXP: do you remember...? *EXP: you said in common the stuffed animals xxx. *MOT: he's never really played with the stuffed animals. *MOT: he's always sort of looked at the books. *MOT: and has spent most of the time chewing on the food. *MOT: I mean it's it's pretty much been the same each of our visits here. *MOT: um and once or twice making a break for the wires. *MOT: yeah. *MOT: um yeah but it's it's been pretty common. *MOT: it's always been the the food that he's played with um the most. *MOT: but that makes sense for how he plays at home as well. *MOT: he likes likes playing with that stuff. *MOT: and um one thing he didn't do today that he normally does at home is um... *MOT: he's spent a lot of time lately taking two things and banging them against each other. *MOT: or banging them on the table. *MOT: like that seems to be his um entertainment of choice recently is the banging. *MOT: um. *CHI: [babbles] *MOT: trying to think. *MOT: what else do you do at home? [to child or herself.] *CHI: [babbles] *MOT: yeah. *MOT: yeah it's strange because honestly I don't see him play on his own all that often. *MOT: because he and his sister are always playing together so that kind of changes the dynamic of things. *MOT: because the two of them are interacting and either avoiding each other. *MOT: or one of them is trying to take the other's things. *MOT: either she's trying to take his stuff. *MOT: or he's trying to take her stuff. *MOT: and sometimes they trade back and forth and actually play w in the same space nicely. *MOT: which is awesome! *MOT: um and really cool to see. *MOT: um but it's it's just there isn't much time that he doesn't have somebody else around him. *MOT: either a play group or with his sister at home that's in the same general space playing with him. *MOT: so that's I guess a difference of being here versus being at home as well. *EXP: I was just thinking just having seen him react to you you know well definitely the no. *EXP: do you think he knows the name book? *MOT: he might know book. *MOT: I'm not sure. *MOT: he does know no. *MOT: whether or not he chooses to mind me he knows no. *MOT: you know he's got a handful of words that he definitely definitely knows. *MOT: and the rest of them it's it's kind of amorphous as to... *MOT: is it that he's responding to my t like when I said *MOT: " oh hand me the book." *MOT: " and let me read it to you. " *MOT: he handed it to me. *MOT: but is it because I said book? *MOT: is it because I said hand it to me? *MOT: is it because of my tone? *MOT: or is it because my hand is out like this? *MOT: and that's what he's holding. *MOT: um 'cause he likes to share... *MOT: he'll crawl over to me and hand me something. *MOT: and I'll take it and be like *MOT: " oh thank you!" *MOT: and hand it back to him. *MOT: and that makes him happy 'cause he's sharing. *MOT: um I don't know if he knows the word book. *MOT: he might. *EXP: are there any um I don't know maybe xxx any foods that xxx. *EXP: I guess it depends on what foods he's eating for him to have a level of excitement to eat it. *MOT: um not really 'cause I mean it's we're still having a lot of junky baby food. *MOT: we don't don't really get into the whole baby signing thing. *MOT: um the two signs that I had learned were more and enough. *MOT: and so when I've been feeding him I've been trying to go *MOT: " okay do you want more?" *MOT: " you want more? " *MOT: at which point his two and a half year old sister pipes up *MOT: " I want more!" *MOT: " I want more!

*MOT: he did more of the food last time. *MOT: this time he was more happy standing up. *MOT: and he usually goes and pulls her hair for a little bit but he didn't do that this time. *MOT: oh here's the ice cream cone. *MOT: that's the only thing baby dolls are good for for him. *MOT: you can pull their hair without them getting mad at you huh?

[puts silver stick flat on black base] *MOT: is that what you're doin'? *CHI: yeah. *MOT: you're recharging it? *CHI: the magnet um holds... *CHI: the magnet like gets part of this [black base]... *CHI: and turns this [silver stick] into a magnet... *CHI: for as long as this [silver stick] is on it [black base maybe]. *CHI: and then this [silver stick] can hang on. *MOT: [places other magnets on black base] *CHI: hey! *CHI: you're ruining it [referent unlcear]! [removes objects Mot has placed on black base] *MOT: I wanna see what happens. *CHI: it all stays on. [removes the two silver sticks and attempts unsuccessfully to stick them together] *CHI: hm. [holds one silver stick so it touches the black base and holds the second silver stick at the top of the first one so the second stick is perpendicular to the black base; uses the perpendicular silver stick to lift the first one from the black base] *CHI: whee! %int: shrieking [puts magnet balls on black base] [Chi's silver stick falls] *MOT: these [magnet balls] have magnets in 'em huh? %add: EXP [shakes magnet balls] *MOT: th some of these marbles? *MOT: Inv? *MOT: yoohoo! %add: INV *MOT: [laughs]. *CHI: whee! *CHI: no! *CHI: I wanna.

[points to the horseshoe magnet which is stuck to the back side of the black base] *MOT: oh it's [horseshoe magnet] sticking. *MOT: yeah. *MOT: it [horseshoe magnet] sticks to one side. *MOT: and it doesn't stick to the other right? *CHI: yeah 'cause it's an opposite side. *CHI: watch. [clears all objects off the black base] *CHI: I don't think these [objects] will stick to this side [of the black base]. [holds the side of the black base which is opposite from the side which the magnets were just stuck to over the magnets, and they stick to it] *CHI: oh! *CHI: they [objects] do. *CHI: hey where's that thing? *MOT: jeez. [taps coins with yellow wand] *MOT: uh money isn't real metal. *MOT: I thought it [coins] was. *MOT: I guess not. *CHI: no. *CHI: money isn't real metal. *CHI: it's fake.

[Chi wants Mot to get a silver man from the black base for her] *MOT: [takes silver man from black base and attempts to stick him to the bottom of the string of objects dangling from Chi's wand] *CHI: okay. *MOT: whoops. [the silver man sticks, but another object falls] *MOT: here. *MOT: try that again. [picks up the fallen nut and replaces it on the string of objects dangling from the wand] *MOT: that was pretty neat huh? *MOT: look at that [construction on wand]. *MOT: and that's [nut] heavier than that [washer from which nut is hanging]. *CHI: [adds a silver man to the construction] *MOT: oh. *MOT: now see if you can get this [paper clip] on that [silver man]. *CHI: no. *CHI: wait. *CHI: are you re tape recording this? *MOT: she's tape recording it. *INV: mhm. *MOT: she has got it. *MOT: here. *MOT: get it back up there again. *CHI: wait.

[taps the side of the black base with the yellow wand] *CHI: 'kay [? wait]. *MOT: hm? *CHI: hm. *CHI: it's makin' it um... [places another silver man on the black base] *CHI: um. *CHI: I don't know. [places a fourth silver man on the black base] *MOT: wait a minute. *MOT: you know what? *MOT: I asked you to make one of these neat figures. [reaches over and pulls black base away from Chi toward her] *MOT: I really want you to. *MOT: but I just want you to figure this out for a minute first. *MOT: okay? *MOT: can you do that? *MOT: just for a minute? *MOT: and then you can do that? *CHI: wait a sec'. [attempts to finish arranging silver men on black base] *MOT: I just want you to answer me this. *MOT: 'cause that'll help you figure a lot. [moves yellow wand toward black base] *MOT: why is it that this one pushes away from here [the top of the black base] and that it's [the yellow wand] attracting there [side of the black base]. [points to the top and side of the black base with the yellow wand as she refers to them in her speech] *CHI: 'cause this is a positive... [taps top of black base] *CHI: this one's negative. [taps yellow wand] *CHI: that part's negative. [taps yellow wand] *CHI: and this one's negative. [taps side of black base] *CHI: and that one's negative. [taps yellow wand] *MOT: what's this called when they push away? [moves yellow wand over top of black base] *CHI: um negative. [takes yellow wand out of Mot's hands] *MOT: are they attractive or repeling? *CHI: repeling. *MOT: what does that mean? *CHI: that... *MOT: it bounces off right? [moves hands toward one another and then away before they touch] *MOT: it pushes away? *CHI: that one's nega'... [uses yellow wand to indicate black base] *CHI: that that one's negative. *CHI: this one's positive. [holds up yellow wand; moves it toward top of black base until the two stick together] *EX2: [laughs]. *CHI: [laughs]. *MOT: [laughs]. *MOT: so what happens when you're goin' like that? [moves yellow wand from the top of the black base to the side of it] *MOT: what's that connection? *MOT: when there's [? this]... *CHI: positive and positive. *MOT: come together. *MOT: no. *MOT: that's when they attract right? *CHI: yeah. *MOT: right. *MOT: and I forget... *MOT: was it negatives? *MOT: positives? *CHI: negative and... *MOT: I forget what it was. *CHI: positives. *CHI: this one's positive. [holds yellow wand above black base] *MOT: but one connection of 'em attract. [holds hand out toward base] *MOT: and one combination of 'em repel right? *EX2: [laughs]. *CHI: cool. [moves yellow wand toward side of black base; black base slides across the table away from the wand] *MOT: you can actually... *MOT: do you think you could move like move a car that way? *MOT: if you put that [yellow wand?] in the engine... *MOT: and you put it on wheels? *MOT: and made it move. *MOT: look. [grabs Chi's hand on wand and moves wand over the top of the base] *CHI: that's not the one! *MOT: you think you could though? *MOT: with that kind of energy? *CHI: [resumes action of using yellow wand to push base across the table] *MOT: see see how you make it move? *MOT: without even touchin' it? *MOT: wouldn't that be neat if you could like power a car that way? *MOT: and you wouldn't need any gas? *MOT: how do you think you could do that xxx? *CHI: [moves yellow wand to top of black base and picks it up] *MOT: Chi imagine that you had the wheels right? [pulls black base off of yellow wand and attempts to put a washer on the side of it] *MOT: put the wheels on the side. *CHI: [takes black base from Mot's hands] *MOT: imagine you could glue them on and they would turn. *MOT: right? *MOT: do you think you could make it [black base] roll? *MOT: with this [yellow just this magnetic energy? *MOT: do you think? *CHI: maybe. [is attempting to stick washers to side of black base] *MOT: I think that's kinda [kind of] neat. *CHI: do you? *MOT: well I forget what combinations of positive and negatives it is but we could look that up. *CHI: hm. *MOT: why don't you make a platform for your uh stage? [picks up silver circle] *MOT: now do this. *MOT: 'cause you make these really awesome designs. *CHI: [puts silver circle on black base] *MOT: [picks up several pieces and moves them towards the base] *CHI: [strange vocalization].

[picks up yellow wand and holds it near black platform] *MOT: if you could keep it [silver man] suspended. *MOT: above something. [points to yellow wand] *MOT: like being pulled with the magnetic energy this way. [grabs silver man and attempts to attach it to the under side of the yellow wand above the black base] *MOT: right? *MOT: watch. *CHI: it could stand up like that. [takes silver man from Mot and puts it on the black base] *MOT: but to have that... [pulls silver man off black base] *MOT: no. *MOT: to have that yank? *MOT: you know that pull? *MOT: see that pull? [holds yellow wand at a slight distance from the silver man that Chi is holding] *MOT: but not have it [yellow wand] actually touch. *MOT: just... *MOT: see that? [yellow wand has just pulled silver man toward it] *MOT: how it's not touching but if you can feel the pull down? *CHI: [takes yellow wand from Mot; holds it over silver man on black base; the whole base sticks to the yellow wand] *CHI: 'oops. *MOT: what's the difference in this [yellow wand]? *MOT: does that [other side of wand] do the same thing? *CHI: [turns yellow wand over and tries to move silver man with it] *MOT: now try the uh difference on here. [points to black base] *MOT: see both sides. *MOT: if it's [yellow wand] the same on both sides. *CHI: [tries both sides of yellow wand on black base] *CHI: it's not the same. *MOT: it's not? *MOT: is one repeling and one attracting? *CHI: yeah. *MOT: what about the sides? [points to the sides of the yellow wand] *CHI: sides are stayin'... [moves one side of the yellow wand down toward the black base; it pushes away; then flips the wand and tries the other side; it sticks and pulls the silver man who had been on the black base to it] *MOT: [laughs]. *MOT: they're different too. *MOT: hm. *MOT: try and make one of your figures. *MOT: you know? *MOT: some awesome things. *MOT: I keep interrupting you. *MOT: sorry. *CHI: whoops.
