the strawberries are nice, and big and fresh and yummy. A: Do you make cheesecake? B: Uh, uh-huh. B: I do. B: But this one is basically, it is like a normal pie crust. A: Uh-huh. B: But then you use this sort of, uh, B: it is a cream cheese, uh, uh, layering, B: but you, use, uh, thin it out a little bit. Uh, or make it a little fluffier A: Uh. B: and you put, uh, line the whole pie crust with that A: Uh-huh. B: and so, it is sort of like in a way. Uh, using cheese cake, A: Uh. B: but, and it is not a real cheese cake B: and then you, A: And just put the strawberries, B: Ok. A: Ok, A: I was watching the soap opera awards. B: Oh A: And, uh, it is really making me want to exercise A: because every single woman in the audience is, uh, about ten pounds. B: Oh A: So. Uh, I started anchoring last, uh, anchoring, uh, exercising last, about last Spring, when I, uh, joined the President's Health Club. B: Uh-huh. A: And, I was really motivated and going, A: and, uh, I went, uh, for a little while, uh. A: I went pretty regular, A: but it is hard to go regularly for a long time. B: Uh-huh. A: And where I live in Waco, uh, they do not have anywhere here that is affiliated with President's A: so now I do not have a club A: and I am, uh, I do not have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that, A: so I am not exercising at the time, at the moment. B: Uh-huh. A: So, I wish I could. A: I wish I did have the motivation to get out and do that, A: but I just do not like just running with no where to go A: I just cannot do that. A: So, B: Well, I understand that. B: I have been trying to get myself motivated. B: I had gone, gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor. Uh, B: she had injured her back and needed a walking partner B: and I thought that would be the time to get going. A: Uh-huh. B: And so, we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks B: and, uh, then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to New York B: and so she is not around. A: Uh. B: And I just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning A: Yeah. B: I don't seem to find time in the day time. A: Yeah. B: And of course, it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity. A: I think a lot of the times, if you have someone to, uh, work out with, or walk with, or something, it does give you that motivation. B: Oh, yeah. A: And you can also, I mean you can, you know, pretty much do it privately if you had your own private, uh, sort of contest. You know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: And that would keep you going. B: Well, more than weight, B: of course, I could lose, uh, lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: but I think more than that, B: I also notice I just feel better when I exercise. A: Oh, yeah. B: And that is something that I am motivated about now because I do need to get myself feeling better just in better shape. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, all the same it is connected to my attitude, B: because I am not feeling as perky and good. B: I am also, B: it is hard to get my attitude to, uh, to get myself up there. A: That is very true. A: It seems like you walk quicker. A: You just, A: perky is a good word for it when you exercise. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: And I understand that walking is suppose to be the, like, the best exercise. A: Better than running. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: Things like that A: cause it, it works everything B: And you have less chance of hurting yourself. A: and it gets your breathing up A: and it doesn't A: yeah, A: it doesn't hurt you. A: Like, I understand running hurt your shins or knees or something like that. B: Yeah. A: So. B: Last time I tried running with my daughter cause she is supposed to be jogging in P E B: and it felt good, B: but then I had pulled a muscle in my knee. B: Actually, I hyper extended it or something, B: and, uh boy, A: Wow. B: I was suffering for about three weeks later. A: Wow. B: So, and I have never had that problem before A: Yeah. B: but I guess that age just starts to catch up to me A: Uh, oh B: It is showing up in the weirdest places. A: I guess my, my, favorite exercise, in the, uh, in the gym, is the bikes. B: Oh, is it? A: To go, A: yeah, A: there are these stationery bikes that you just ride A: and if you watch television, they usually have television in there or something, or if you listen to a walkman, it is pretty, it is pretty okay. A: Again, that is sort of weird, because you, you, are not going anywhere A: and, uh, I use to play racquetball B: Uh-huh. A: and I really liked that, because, you know, to me it had a point. B: Yeah A: You know, uh, there were points you could, you would make A: and there was a point to it, A: but running and jogging and just not going anywhere is just, A: I don't like that, A: I just can't understand that. A: So, I don't do, B: Yeah. B: Well, I have got a dog now B: and, of course, she needs walking A: Uh, yeah. B: and that is a little less uh, burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her. A: Uh-huh. B: And I can put on the earphones to have something to listen to B: and, A: Yeah. A: I know a lot of people just to be safe, A: like you were talking about, walking at night and in the morning or early in the morning. Uh, B: Yeah. A: you see a lot of, uh, mostly older people though but, that, uh, walk in the malls. B: Oh, yeah. A: You know, like early in the mornings and things like that. A: I have never tried that. B: Yeah. A: I don't know. A: You know, I have never even thought about it really. B: Yeah. B: That is kind of an idea. B: We, we have, uh, over here in Plano, a little recreation center that has got, uh, a walking track, B: that it is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year. A: Uh. B: But, I find it very tedious because I am watching the clock constantly, B: and it there is just nothing else to look at A: Oh. B: and I actually get more tired doing that, than B: I could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good. B: There I could barely make a couple of miles A: Uh-huh. A: And that is a little less, A: Well, what kind of music do you like? B: Well, seeing as how I'm a musician I like all kinds of music. A: Yeah. B: All very very kinds. A: Me too. A: I mostly like classical and jazz. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, I like everything from hard core country to you know Wagner, and Mahler B: and I like new age stuff. B: I, I basically have a wide range of musical likes. B: Do you, uh, are you musical, uh, B: are you a musician at all? A: Yeah A: I play the trumpet. B: Do you A: Uh-huh. A: Mostly the trumpet music uh, uh, uh, baroque and, uh, uh, uh Romantic. B: Jazz. A: Baroque and romantic. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: that is not, there is, uh, things written for Doc Severenson and, uh, a few other people. A: But, uh, they are just, uh, A: as far as solos and concertos are concerned, A: but the rest of them are just parts B: Right. A: And, uh, B: Well, I love baroque music, B: so, it is one of my favorite periods. A: Yeah. B: In fact I I sing with a Texas baroque ensemble. A: Uh-huh A: Who are the trumpet players? B: Well, we used to have, uh, Ralph Dutchen. A: Uh-huh. B: But now he is in Massachusetts. B: He has come back a couple of times. B: Then there is a trumpet player at North Texas, the, the teacher, the main teacher. Yeah A: Leonard . B: And he has played. B: And the two of them have played natural trumpets B: And occasionally, when she can't get those people, we use you know, just uh, E flat trumpets, with valves B: and like Glen Bell plays. A: Yeah. B: Uh, Rick, uh, Bogarts played too A: Uh-huh. B: so but actually, I like trumpet and organ together. B: It is a nice combination. A: Yeah. A: Richard Jung Julio recorded an album at the same time as , A: didn't he? B: Yeah, B: I think he did. A: Yeah. B: With Paul. B: Yeah B: He is wonderful. B: Both of them are. A: Uh-huh B: So do you like romantic music? A: Well, that is what, that is mostly the rest of good trumpet marks are romantic music, Mahler and Ruckner and Strauss B: Uh-huh B: Do you like opera? A: Uh, I like, I am liking it more and more now. B: Uh-huh. A: Getting use to it A: They are mostly, uh, mostly Mozart. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean there is not any kind of trumpet parts, A: but, uh, you know, the, I just like the melodies more and, uh, libretto. B: Uh-huh. B: You don't like Puccini? A: Uh, yeah. A: I like Rossini better than Puccini. B: Uh-huh. A: I like more comic licks. B: Uh-huh. B: Are you going to go see the Elixir of Love? A: No. B: Do you ever go to the Dallas Opera? A: Uh, no A: I have never been to a Dallas Opera A: only the Fort Worth Opera B: Uh-huh. A: And my trumpet teacher used to play in the Fort Worth Opera. B: Who was your trumpet teacher? A: John Nelson. B: Uh-huh. B: I know him, B: I kind of know him. A: Uh-huh. B: Is he still around here? A: Yeah, A: he plays in the Fort Worth Symphony and Fort Worth mostly. B: Because I don't, I have not seen him playing anywhere lately, B: but maybe it is cause he is playing in Fort Worth A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: Well, I am basically a Church musician. B: I do a Church in Plano. A: Uh-huh. B: And we do all kinds of music at my Church B: and we hire lots of instrumentalists off and on for, uh, different things. B: So, I am always making music of one kind or another. A: Uh-huh. A: Which Church is it? B: The Christ United Methodist Church in Plano A: It seems like a lot of Churches are hiring more musicians now than they use to. B: Yeah. B: Most Churches have the, B: well there are some of the few organizations that have the funds to, uh, you know, do like big big works Uh, B: but we hire, you know, we hire an orchestra at least twice a year and then different instrumentalists off and on through out the year. B: In fact, we have, B: do you know John Qumenato? A: Yeah. B: He plays at our Church a lot. B: In fact he is playing this Sunday at our Church. B: But he plays pretty regularly. A: He is still teaching at Brookhaven, A: isn't he? B: Uh, I think so. B: He teaches a lot in Plano at high schools A: Uh, yeah. B: and, I think he teaches at Brookhaven. A: Yeah, A: because I heard Glen Bell taught at Plano as well. B: Yeah, B: Glen teaches here too. A: Uh-huh. B: They are, the two of them are mainly pretty much the, they have cornered the market on trumpet. A: Why don't you tell me about your choir. B: Oh. B: Okay, B: well, we, uh, are a group of, uh, musicians that just kind of have, you know, formed out of a desire to sing B: and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they, or just real talented I should say. A: Uh-huh. B: Lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching. Uh, B: others have, B: there's one gal that's in the, uh, Plano Community Orchestra. Uh, B: just, you know, different backgrounds. B: It's been really kind of interesting. A: Great. B: So, A: Uh, I play the piano B: Um. A: and, uh, I have a four year old who, who has started to play the piano. A: He does that, uh, musically, listens A: and then he can play, which is kind of interesting. B: Oh, yeah. A: I think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here, in, in the community at Music Man. B: Oh, they did? A: Yeah, A: and that's lots of fun. B: How did, How did they get involved in that? A: Uh, basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions. A: It was the Plano Repertory Theatre. B: Uh-huh. A: And so they went and tried out A: and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man A: and my son played one of the children in a band. B: Oh, how fun. A: So, yeah, A: it was really fun, A: and, uh, my son plays the clarinet in his band at school, A: and my daughter takes piano lessons, too. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, we just really like music. A: It's a, I, I especially like it as an outlet when the T V goes off, A: we get the T V off and just have some nice quiet music. B: Um, uh-huh, B: um. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: that's nice. B: You say have your four year old taking lessons already? A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, who do you have her, or him, take it from? A: Uh, I have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki. Which is an auditory type learning experience. B: Uh-huh. A: You listen to the music and then learn to play it by by hearing the intervals and things like that. B: Uh-huh. A: I teach, uh, like what is traditionally taught, you know, A: you look at the note on the page A: and you play what's on the piano, A: but he can't learn like that. A: He's a delayed child. A: He's only about, I guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things. B: Oh. A: And, uh, so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it, uh, with his right hand, A: we went, wow B: Uh-huh. A: we better have him do do something. You know, educationally. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: So that was really fun. B: Well, because my, A: My husband and I love to go to the musicals downtown, though. B: Pardon me? A: So, my husband and I love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, I have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five A: Um. B: because she wanted, you know, she just seemed to enjoy it so much B: and now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play B: and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally. B: She just, A: Oh, I think that's great. B: So I wasn't sure when to start her. B: I didn't want to push her too early, either, but, uh, kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene. A: That's really hard I think, because, especially if you start them A: and then they get pretty good A: and then they get close, ten, you know, eleven or something, A: they go, I don't want to do this anymore A: and you're like God, I really want you to do it. B: Uh-huh B: Yeah. A: You know. B: Yeah. A: So sometimes it's hard to, to know exactly when, A: but, I don't know, A: if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I think she'd like to, B: I just don't know if it's really, B: knowing from what my daughter has gone through, she's, she learned a lot B: and, of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it. A: Uh-huh. B: It was something easily forgotten. B: So, uh, I don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight B: or, or should I say seven. B: I mean, she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally. B: She does have to really work at it, B: but, uh, so, A: That's like me. B: Yeah, B: but, so I'm kind of, you know, just playing with it, B: but at this point we're going to kind of wait, I think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway B: but, A: Well, it can get expensive B: Yeah. A: that's for sure. B: Yeah. A: I, my friend is, is very generous in, in letting us have my children, uh, do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, that's good. A: Yeah, A: so it's been good for our family. B: Well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a Suzuki method, B: have you had any former Suzuki students? A: I don't have any Suzuki students. Uh, B: I was wondering how, A: Something happening to me at Christmas time that, that verified to me that I will A: I'm ready B: Why don't you go ahead and start off A: Okay, A: well, I don't have an elderly person that I could send to a, a nursing home or anything. A: My, both of my parents are dead, A: but I did have a friend that was in a convalescent home, uh, like a nursing home A: and I went there very often to visit her and, uh, made me feel really sad. A: If I did have a mother living, I don't think I could do that. A: I think they would be better off being at home with their family, you know. B: I agree, although, we're in that situation right now. A: Uh-huh. B: We have a, an eighty seven year old mother in law living with me right now A: Uh-huh. B: and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently. B: And even moving from her house to our house has been tremendously unsettling for her A: Uh-huh. B: and we have several young children A: Uh-huh. B: and they about drive her crazy. A: Oh, I can believe that. A: Yes, A: because most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that. A: In a situation like that maybe it would be better. B: Well, we've, you know, we've struggled a lot with it because, again, most of the nursing homes I've been in are very depressing to me. A: Uh-huh. B: And she's still alert enough that I think she would really know that we were putting her there A: Oh, yeah. B: and I think she would really resent it, B: and I think that would make it very hard. A: Uh-huh. B: But, on the other hand, I see my wife with, B: I guess our youngest one now is five A: Oh. B: and her trying to struggle because her mother really cannot take care of herself. B: She needs to be bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of things. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh A: see, now that's, that's, that's really a sad situation. B: And so the drain on the family. A: Yeah, A: really, you know. B: And when the kids have kids come, you know, she's always saying, you know, why do they have to be here, B: why can't they send them home, B: it's too noisy B: and she'll say that to the kids' friends. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: right, A: right. B: So it's a hard situation, either way, I think. A: Yeah, A: in a case like that, you know, you more or less think it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where, B: I think that's one of the things we're really wrestling with. B: When does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that as opposed to considering her current circumstances A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: and, A: Uh-huh, A: but the cost of these nursing homes are so, You know, B: Oh, prohibitive. A: a lot of people can't afford that. B: Yeah. A: You know, so you really have no choice that way if you, you know, if you're not rich or you know. A: Uh, I know this lady that, you know, that was a friend of mine, A: now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there, you know, A: and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there. B: Yeah. A: So, B: I think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care that's more readily available, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: I think if we could send her someplace for the day and she could be around some elderly people and have some activities would be of more interest to her and then in the evening have her return and be with the family. A: Yeah, A: then bring her back home at night. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: you know, just come home for dinner A: and then usually they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow. B: Yeah. A: You know, so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that A: but, B: But there's not many of those available right now A: Yeah. B: and they're very hard to get them into B: and we tried sending her to a senior citizen center. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: But they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile. A: Uh-huh. B: And so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in, she can't participate in. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh, A: um. B: But I think it's an issue that, you know, B: with the graying of America, we're really going to have to, as a, as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this. A: Uh-huh. B: Because it is a difficult situation B: and, you know, you hate seeing them just, sort of send off and not well cared for. A: Yeah, A: if if they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going on around them and everything like that, well, I can see, maybe a nursing home would be better, you know. B: And yet, A: But if they, they have their wits about them and everything, why, it's kind of hard B: And then I think it depends on their physical ability, too, you know, B: if they could be up and doing some things it might be better than when they're just sort of needing almost constant supervision and care. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Well, uh, my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that A: and, uh, luckily, I mean, she lived by herself A: and then, you know, one day she had a heart attack A: and she was gone, A: so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that, A: but there's, so many of us kids, there was like seven of us that, my, we wouldn't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow. B: Yeah. A: You know, she could have taken turns living with each one of us, you know, for a a a period of time because we all don't live in the same city anyhow, nor the same state A: so, B: Do you live at all close to each other? A: Uh, I, I have a couple more that live out here in California, A: but then I have a A: Uh, why don't you go ahead first. B: Okay. B: Uh, short term, uh, it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over B: so budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much, uh extra to go around. A: Sure. B: Uh, long term is something we're starting to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about, uh, gee, B: she's eight now B: so I guess about ten years. A: Uh-huh. B: Good heavens. B: So we're, we're starting to think about long term considerations. College and retirement. B: But with not a whole lot of discretionary money, it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it. A: Sure. B: How about you? A: That's kind of, uh, A: to what we're doing is budgeting, you know. A: Month to month is, uh, kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra A: so that's kind of how we do it, uh, from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, long term, that's a little bit easier for us because, uh, with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings, Four Oh One K plans uh, that kind of, you know, retirement plans, that kind of stuff B: Uh-huh. A: so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see versus when it's on the paycheck B: Right. A: and you have to try and take out some of that money. A: You always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month A: so, uh, long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because, uh, it's automatically taken out. A: So, uh, that works out much better for us, A: so that's kind of how we do it anyway A: but, B: And the old, uh, if you can't see it, then you can't spend it, uh, idea A: exactly A: and if you can't touch it, you can't spend it either. A: So that kind of works out where you get into, uh, some plans that, you know, you touch it you're going to get a penalty, that kind of thing, A: so it leads you to kind of say well I'm not going to take it out. A: I'm going to keep it and, uh, keep it in there and let it grow so that someway, maybe for retirement you're going to have that money left. A: Let's hope anyway, A: so you'll have that B: Right. A: so that's kind of how we do it. A: But ours is more like month to month too, uh, A: short term is, to get things going A: so. Anyway, other than that, uh, is kind of how we do it A: so. I don't know if we're, our time is up or what B: Uh-huh. B: Uh, they'll, uh A: They'll let us know B: Yeah, B: exactly. B: We, we actually do have some money in a Four Oh One K. B: I just wish I could afford to, uh, put more away each week because I agree that it's a, an excellent way, A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, definitely, A: definitely. A: And, uh, it grows, uh, A: it, it seems like at first you're not going to see a big return A: but as the years go on, if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better A: and, uh, so, you know, you just have to kind of look at it that way A: and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do. A: Automatic, you know, deposit from checks to where you don't see it. B: Right. A: And, uh, you know, exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent. B: Yeah. A: It's put into our savings account A: and we don't see it, A: then it works out to where, you know, you don't look at it, A: you just look at the checking account, and say this is what we have for money A: and that's it, A: so B: Yeah, B: checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be I'm convinced. A: Yeah, A: it, it's easy because you do spend it, A: that's for sure. A: Like I said, you know, you kind of look at it, uh, A: you better have some other way of, uh, savings, A: otherwise, uh, checking accounts aren't the best for, you know, long term type of planning, A: so. And you don't get a good return on it anyway, A: so, other, B: Yeah, B: I guess there, other than things like the stock market or mutual funds, there's really not much of a return on anything these days. A: Exactly. A: Right now. A: Yeah, A: it's a bad time, you know. B: Yeah, B: the interest is so low. B: I mean it, it's nice for people buying homes B: but for older people who have money in C D or whatever, it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Exactly, A: exactly. A: You know, we have some in-laws, uh, that, uh, had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and, uh, kind of took them out of that because they got so low A: but, uh, A: yeah, A: it's, it drops A: so your better bet is to, uh, try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of, uh, savings plans or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing A: so. B: Yeah, B: I'm, I'm with a small company now B: and I hope that, uh, if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing A: Sure. B: that'll be very nice. A: Yeah, A: that's great, A: yeah A: Okay. B: Well I guess we're kind of running out of steam on this topic here. A: Yeah, A: exactly A: Okay. A: Well, uh, just briefly. A: Uh, I worked in a nursing home A: so I kind of know, from way back, uh, how things used to be run A: and I think there has been definite changes of nursing homes A: but I think, uh, if I had to personally put one of my parents in a nursing home, they would have to be pretty bad off to where I couldn't take care of them at all. A: It would be something that, you know, I would certainly, A: if they're forgetting things or whatever, I'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care where somebody comes in B: Uh-huh. A: and they cook meals A: and they clean their house for them, A: that kind of thing, A: so they still have their own independence A: and not reliable, you know, A: they don't have to be in a nursing home situation. A: But, uh, I don't think A: the nursing homes, when I was working in them, were very much understaffed, very much, uh, in need of good personnel. Uh, A: I think the patients weren't given the quality of care that A: I wouldn't have, you know, A: I look at it and say thank God, A: I got out of that kind of situation. A: But they, they were not given the time B: Yeah. A: and they were not given the money, basically, to staff, appropriately, people to help. B: Uh-huh. A: And I can remember lifting a patient all by myself, simply because there was not another person to help. A: It's either leave the patient in bed all day long or get them up A: and I would have preferred to get them up than to leave them in bed all day. A: But, uh, uh, so I think nursing homes are, have changed. A: I'm not quite sure, A: but hopefully, they have. B: Yeah, B: I guess I haven't had that much experience. B: I've only seen like my great grandparents in a nursing home A: Uh-huh. B: but I have an aunt who lived on her own until she was well in her nineties A: Yeah. A: Sure. B: and then she, she got sick B: and she ended up in nursing home A: Uh-huh. B: and my parents went to visit her B: and it got to the point where the it seemed like the nursing home didn't want to deal her anymore A: Sure. B: and so they gave her drugs to keep her asleep. A: Yeah. A: I, I think that's, that can happen A: and I think in the nursing home that I worked for, A: I wasn't quite sure of it, A: but I'm sure that some of the patients were, uh, given medication to keep them in, uh, quiet A: and, and, B: Nice sedative state. A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: And they would just lay all day long A: and, uh, the ones A: they also put mentally ill patients in the same, A: they were not on the same, you know, ward, A: but they, they were in the same nursing home A: so that these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other, uh, older people that were in there for reasons of, uh, you know age, uh, A: the mentally ill patients could walk right in, into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically. A: Because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing, they could, they had freedom to just walk around A: and a lot of them were, I think there was a couple that were schizophrenic A: and I remember one time watching one of the, uh, schizophrenic patients actually go out on, I don't know what they call it, a binge or whatever you want to say it B: Uh-huh. A: she grabbed a hold of this, A: and it was kind of funny when I looked back at it, A: but, I mean, I remember the patient getting very upset. A: That woman actually pulled, uh, the other person's hair. A: I mean she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair, you know, A: and it was a guy that was just really upset. A: I mean he said what the hell are you think you're doing, you know, A: and I laughed at it then A: but then I'm thinking God, you know, A: if I had to put my parents in that nursing home, I wouldn't want them there. A: So I think there's laws now that kind of protect. That nursing homes either have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the same type of facilities, B: Yeah. A: even though they're aging mentally ill, they are still mentally ill A: and a lot of these older people have their, you know, they're not insane or anything like that. A: They don't have these tendencies to, to lash out. B: To be violent. A: But seeing that kind of made me think twice about, A: jeez, A: I wouldn't put my mother, father in that nursing home at all. B: Was this in a big town or a little town? A: A small town. B: Oh, really? A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: Because it seems like the small town nursing homes, there's a lot more personal attention. A: I don't know. A: I don't know. A: I, I kind of look at it this way. A: I think if you have a big city area, I think there's more people to keep watch on it. B: Uh-huh. B: You have more options. A: And, A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: And you have more competition. A: And I think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community. A: And this is back in nineteen seventy-seven that I worked there B: Uh-huh A: and I look back at it and say jeez, you know, A: it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there. A: But my grandmother, uh, later on got cancer and, uh, could no longer, A: well actually she, A: Uh, taxes A: Do you want to go ahead? B: Sure. B: We pay far too much in taxes. B: Well, far too much for what we get. B: I mean it's just, I don't know, it just seems too much of the money is just lost A: Uh-huh. A: I agree. A: Uh-huh. A: Well I think, uh, you know, when I look at, uh, all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at a, at a better discount, uh, A: when you, when, B: Um. B: You mean like those, you know, twenty thousand dollar toilets A: Exactly, A: exactly. A: That's exactly, uh, the whole thing. A: When you take a look at all those issues of where our money is going A: and it's just, A: as long as the person that's spending the money, uh, doesn't think about A: oh, I can go out and spend anything that I want to A: it's just unlimited, B: Sure, B: it's real easy to spend other people's money. B: Right? A: Right. A: An unlimited source A: so they, they think well I'll go out and buy a four hundred toilet seat A: and I could have went to K-Mart and bought it for, you know, ten or fifteen A: I mean, that kind of thing A: and, uh, B: Right. B: I don't mind them getting what they need. B: It's just when they pay so much for it. A: Exactly. B: It takes you know, very little to just shop around and, A: Exactly. A: And I know a lot of, uh, corporations now are looking at their amount of money that's being spent A: and they're looking at what's the best buy. B: That's true A: It used to be you could go, if you had a company you had to go through certain people A: and you didn't care what you paid. B: Yep. A: I mean you just got it done. A: Now people are putting in bids for things and are looking at things. A: Going to actually shop at Best Buy for, Best Buy is one of our electronic stores for fax machines, things like that, instead of going through these office supply companies that mark up their amounts and say, you know, I'll give you a legal pad for five bucks, B: Right. A: and you can go to another shop and get it for maybe sixty cents or or ninety cents B: Yeah. A: that kind of thing A: so. B: I'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering like the world's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years A: Except for everything keeps going up, you know. A: And I know as a middle class, uh, you know, A: and also I have one dependent has my daughter B: Uh-huh. A: and I keep looking at well where's the tax, so-called tax, uh, relief for having children. B: Yeah, B: I know. A: I mean, there is none A: I mean, I think I paid just as much as when I didn't have her, B: Oh, I know, B: I mean I don't even, You know, I don't even get to see half my paycheck. A: so A: Uh-huh. B: Between Four Oh One K and, and the thirty-four percent they're taking out for taxes. A: Sure. A: Exactly. B: Let alone what I end up having to pay A: Uh-huh. A: Exactly. A: Yeah, A: that's the whole thing. A: Now they have gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes, A: but you're still going to owe the government as much money B: Sure. A: so by the end of this coming year, what's going to happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government A: and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings, uh, account. B: Nope, B: they won't be able to pay. A: They won't be able to pay it A: and there'll be a lot of problems because of that, you know. A: Put people into, you know, January or February which is always suppose to be, A: the month after Christmas is supposed to be high spending because everything is on sale. A: Nobody's going to have the money to spend. B: Sure B: none . A: They're going to be paying on their taxes A: so they're going to have to just cut back A: so, I don't know where the answer is A: and B: I don't, B: in the first place, you know, there's also like taxation without representation. B: Well I don't feel represented anymore in our government. B: I mean, it it's certainly not a government for me. A: Yeah, A: Yeah. B: It doesn't take care of my needs A: No, A: no. A: Well, that's the whole thing. A: I think people are getting so fed up with it. A: Now, we go through another election and listen to all these lies about the, B: and people don't care anymore either. A: No. A: No. B: People don't want to go out to vote. A: Well, I don't think people think they can make a difference. A: And when you've got candidates as you do. A: It's candidates that have money B: Yep. A: and it's backed by big business. A: And big business says well we don't care about the little person A: and, uh, you know, you're not going to get anymore Abe Lincolns around. B: No, B: but but that, that's going to backfire because little people who buy everything, A: Uh-huh. A: Well who knows, uh, A: yeah. B: so A: Generations from now we might, uh, set back in our little, uh, rocking chairs and watch our grandchildren go through an entirely different system of things and say, you know, this government itself isn't working. A: Just like the communist government of, uh, the old U S S R. B: Yeah A: And maybe that's going to happen to America where they'll say, hey A: we're fed up. B: Yeah, B: I wonder though A: Maybe it'll have to be just individual state tax. A: And each state take care of itself and no government type of, uh, you know, A: where you have to pay out to federal or whatever. A: I don't know. A: Who knows A: but, B: Yeah, B: I'm not B: I don't know, B: I can't think of any easy answers to it B: but something has to happen, B: I mean I'm certainly fed up with it. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. A: Yeah A: Everybody is, A: in fact, I'm not sending in my check A: or So what do you think? A: Should they, uh, should young Americans be forced to do a year of service? B: I don't, I don't think they should be forced, B: but I think they should be, I guess, encouraged to, to do some kind of public work, I guess to, just to get them, I guess involved with community maybe, you know, B: just community activity. B: If nothing else, see how the city works, stuff like that. A: Yeah, A: I think something like the Peace Corps is a bit harsh. B: Yeah, A: No kids, B: I kind of, I think so, too. B: I think that's a bit dramatic, B: but, but other than that I think it's, it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and, you know, like the, uh, shelters and, uh, that kind of, thing, helping out, uh, volunteering, I guess, if they can. A: Yeah. A: I think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two. B: Yeah. A: I, I, I'd force them. A: I think that, uh, I think it would be, I think I think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work A: and no one just realizes it. B: Your right, B: I do, too, B: I think they start out young, like in, uh, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts a video doing A: Right, A: exactly. A: I was a, I was a Boy Scout. A: As part of being a Boy Scout, you had to do, you know, projects all throughout A: and then to become an Eagle Scout you have to spend a, do a yearlong project. B: Right, B: that's, see that's what we did in Girl Scouts B: and that got you involved real good B: and it, I think it starts kids out on the right track B: and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing. A: Yeah. B: Something, A: I think, I, I, now I think people generally volunteer. B: Yeah. A: That there's no problem with getting them to, do stuff. B: I do, too. B: I think, I think a lot of people, a lot more people volunteer than, than, uh, than we, than get credit for it as, you know, like in hospitals and, uh, and the shelters and stuff like that. B: And even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays, I mean at least they're getting out and doing it and you know, helping, helping out. B: I think that's good B: and, A: Well, we have a funny commercial around here. A: It says something like, if people were to give five, hours a week or five percent of their salary, we could, they could solve all the world's problems or something. A: So, I guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could, uh, B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: or just, or just gave, or, or, or just forced our kids just to, to, force kids to serve for, uh, parents, I guess. B: Yeah B: There you go. A: Substitute. A: My, my, yeah, B: Right. A: my kid will do four or five hours this week for me. A: No problem. B: Yeah, B: it sounds pretty good B: That sounds good. B: I've noticed a lot of, uh, different organizations in our community, uh, pick up, like on the highway and stuff, B: and I think that's pretty neat. B: They, uh, go along and have so many miles I guess of highway to take over A: Uh-huh. B: and they clean it up. A: I've seen that. A: Yeah. B: And keep it clean. B: I think that's I pretty good idea. B: And I think, you know, again B: I've seen a lot of young kids doing that B: and I think it gets them prepared to, to learn how to volunteer as they get older. B: I know I did, you know, in Girl Scouts and everything B: and after that in high school I would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that A: They, they, just started trying to get them, something together like, like that around here from, for, from the community because, uh, we had a big ice storm uh, very, very recently. B: So, B: Oh. A: You don't sound like you're in the north. A: You sound like you're in the south somewhere. B: Yeah, B: I'm in Texas. B: Where are you at? A: Yeah, uh, A: I'm in, uh, New York. B: New York. A: Upstate New York, A: yeah. B: Oh, gosh. A: And, uh, B: Yeah. A: Long way, uh, B: Yeah A: And we just had a really big ice storm. A: And, basically, half the trees in, in our city, I'm in Rochester which is, uh right upstate. Half of the trees in the city, uh, are no good anymore. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, no. A: That's how bad it was. A: Everything is just down everywhere. B: Oh. A: You know, we had three hundred thousand people without power. B: Golly. A: You know, it was, A: and, you know, and, and they, and we didn't have power for a week A: and there are still people who don't have power. B: Are you serious? A: Oh, yeah, A: it's been, it's been, it's been ten days already A: and there are still something like ten thousand people without power. B: Oh my God, B: how do they live? A: and were officially, yeah, A: and we're officially in a state of emergency. A: Funny thing is the news, the national news how they covered it. Uh, B: Yeah. B: I haven't heard a thing. A: Yeah. A: I think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something A: and, and we've been in a state of emergency for over, you know, for ten or eleven days. B: Lord. A: You know. A: We just got our phone back today, uh, A: and, and, they're you know, putting out ads now for people to come volunteer, or to have their organizations come, volunteer to help clean up the streets. B: Well, that's good. B: That's great. A: Because we have, you know, A: everywhere that a tree is down people need help A: and, we're all, all, a lot of older folks need help getting, their yards cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone B: Right. B: Yeah. A: and they, and, and they certainly can't carry it themselves B: Right. A: and, A: So, B: and we go along B: and, I'm really not sure how we find the individuals, B: but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that desperately need it, B: and, uh, we go along with all the material and in one day, more or less, go in and say, roof, paint, fix whatever we can. A: Oh, that's great. B: Yeah, B: and spend a day doing, B: that's really neat. B: I mean, it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time, B: but you know, every little bit helps. A: And is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth A: or, B: Uh, yeah. B: They, uh, luckily we have a, a man who owns a building company. A: Oh, so he, B: So he donates a lot, not everything, but a lot of the material. B: Then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy. A: That's real nice. B: Yeah. B: And it's not, you know, we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it, you know so much as, we just want to help people out. A: Right. B: So it's real neat. A: That, that's real good. B: It's, Yeah, A: And I, and I bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that. B: it's like I say, B: it's not a lot, B: but it helps people. B: Like this last couple we helped, you know, they were in their eighties B: and she was bedridden B: and, I just, you know, just tears your heart out to to see this kind of thing A: Yeah. B: and you know, if you can do any a little bit, it helps, B: so A: That's, that's, uh, that's real good. B: Yeah. A: We had, uh, we had organizations like that in college, you know. A: We had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups A: and some did like that, some did elderly visits, B: Yeah. A: some did, uh, some did, you know, Big Brother, Big Sister, stuff like that. A: And I'm convinced that, that, that at least twenty-five percent of our school participated in some sort of a, some sort of group. You know, activity like that. B: Gosh. B: That's great. B: That's a lot. A: You know. Twenty-five, I don't know. Twenty-five percent? A asks someone else in the A: Yeah, A: my wife was big in that B: That's, that's a lot of kids, though. A: And she thinks, yeah, A: twenty-five percent. A: It, it was a small school B: Oh, well, still that's a, you know, that's a good chunk of kids. A: But, uh, A: Yeah, A: but, I mean, a, a, a lot of people would get involved A: and, you know, because there were all different, organizations to do. A: There was Big Brother, Big Sister, B: Yeah. A: they had a yearly auction, A: they had a dance marathon for charity or, to, to support that, group. B: Yeah. B: That's neat. A: Such that, you know, lots of people got involved that way. B: That's great. A: Yeah. B: That's great. B: But, uh, like, I'll agree with you, though, B: I don't think they should have to do a year A: Yeah, A: no, A: neither do I. A: I think it should be completely optional A: and you know. B: Yeah. B: I don't think that, some people I don't think have, uh, a year in them to volunteer if you know what I mean. B: They're not worth it A: Yeah, A: they're not worth a year. A: Or some people just, just can't even afford it, you know, whatever. A: I mean, the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well. You know? B: Right. B: Oh, yeah, B: that's true, B: that's true. A: People get shipped off A: and then, you know, and then, and then their parents, A: I have a, uh, a, a friend whose, whose son is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala, or daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now. B: Oh. A: And, you know, he and his wife just went off to visit her A: and, you know, I know I could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala. B: I couldn't either. A: You know, so B: I couldn't either. A: so I think, you know, A: and, and, and the kid's certainly not making much money. B: Right, B: right. A: So I can see where that, that, may be a problem. B: Yeah. B: I just know one person that's in the Peace Corps B: and, I mean, she's a teacher and, and just wanted to do it. B: She'd been a teacher for a while. B: Just decided she wanted to do it, B: so. I mean, I'm grateful for people like that, B: but, I don't see how they can just, Yeah, A: Just take off a year. B: just, pick up and head on out. A: Yeah, A: I don't, B: I wish I could do something like that, B: but I can't, B: so A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: well neither can I, A: so, I, I, I, I, I, I, did my service before A: and I'll do my little community service throughout, but never never for a year again. B: Right, B: that's the way I am. B: I know the feeling. A: So, so I guess our vote is no B: That's right B: We're against it B: That's right. A: Well, it's been nice talking to you again. B: You, too, B: and I hope everything works out up there. A: Well, yeah, A: we're, we're slowly getting everything back together again. A: You know, it, it's taking time, A: but everything, you know, B: Yeah. A: we got lucky. A: We had no damage to our house or anything A: so, The rest will just have to come with time. B: Good, B: good, B: that's great. B: Yeah. B: Well, good luck. A: Well, good luck to you, too. B: Thanks. A: Bye-bye or B: Bye video A: Okay. B: All right, uh, B: feelings on what caused the S and L crisis B: I guess I don't have a real technical knowledge for what happened B: I gather that there where large numbers of situations where loans were made that appeared to be a good loan but in a speculative since B: and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during the Reagan eight years, uh, more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans B: and then when they began to collapse one after the other I think almost like an avalanche of, of property values devalued. A: Uh-huh, A: kind of like a domino's effect. B: Right. B: I don't have a, a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome. dogs. B: Are they really? B: I don't think I've ever seen one. A: Uh, they're really nice. A: I, I've dealt with quite a few of them. A: People, uh, customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like, they, uh, fit collars and stuff on them A: and they are, they are just really nice, really friendly, uh, kind of like medium intelligence. Uh, B: Well, how do they become B: how did they get their reputation, then? A: Well, because some people, uh, want to train them as, B: Oh, they train them to be that way, then. A: Yeah. B: Oh, okay. A: You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way. B: Oh, okay. A: Yeah, A: it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond. B: Oh, dear, B: so the the poor animal is doing it in self protection. A: Right. B: Oh, dear. A: Yeah, A: they aren't, they aren't by nature really nasty critters. A: They are very determined critters B: Uh-huh. A: and so once you get them going, it's not good to to deal with, but, they, I, I really like them. *two utts? A: I was, I was impressed by them. A: They're, they're real sturdy little critters A: and they aren't that big. And, uh, just really friendly. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, that's unusual. A: I was, I was overwhelmed. B: I, B: Huh, well, I suppose you were surprised. A: Yeah. B: After the reputation that, you know A: Yeah, A: right now, B: they have quite an, uh, uh, notable reputation as far as, you know, A: They picked up a lot of bad press lately. B: Yeah, B: they're banned from, in some areas I understand. A: Well, yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: But, any, any, any pet's going to, can, can be bad if you train it to be that way. B: You know, that, B: they must have just targeted that breed and said, boy, we're going A: Well, yeah, A: it's, when, A: in my hometown, they just outlawed ferrets because they had one incident of a ferret, uh, attacking a a child in a house. B: Oh, okay. B: Oh, okay. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean, these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret. A: The, the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild B: Uh-huh. A: and, you know, they should expect something like that to happen. A: And so A: now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town. B: Oh, did it attack the child, then? A: Yeah, A: it, it bit him. B: Uh-huh. A: And that was, that was not a good thing, A: but I think it was probably a, an individual ferret thing, because it was it was a fairly wild ferret. B: Well, the the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that. Sure, A: Hadn't, they hadn't, A: Yeah, A: I mean they really should have, should have expected it. And taken the precautions. A: They didn't. B: yeah. A: It's too bad it happened, though. B: Yeah, B: because then the, the animal's in trouble, and not the person. A: Right. A: Go ahead B: Uh, have you every been tested for a new job or anything? A: Uh, no A: I haven't. A: But, in my job, I'm a nurse, and we are allowed to be. A: I mean, you know, this is the rules that they can do this anytime. A: Uh, I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested. B: So it's just sort of, uh, B: they can if they, A: They can if they choose to. B: Oh, okay. A: Right. A: Have you, well have you had any experience with it at all? B: Uh, not really B: but I've always worked on a university level B: but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff. A: Uh-huh. A: So what do you think about that? B: Uh, I don't, I don't think they're very accurate B: because, I mean, I know their lifestyles changed prior to the drug test B: and I know they changed afterwards. A: Right, A: right. A: See I know of that too. A: And I also know that things like antihistamines, Sudafeds, things like that, can really throw it off. A: And you cannot get a job because of it Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I, I had a friend, B: it didn't cause her any problems with her job B: but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen. B: But what it was, was she had been she had been, uh, in the jungle B: and it was some Malaria medication B: and she tested positive for that. A: See, and so it really is a dangerous thing that way A: because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job A: and they weren't told why. A: But a lot of people say the reason why, after you take a physical, will be because of the drug testing A: or they would tell you. A: Or this person never use any drugs. B: See, I always, B: I thought they got, you got called back if you tested positive, for more tests. A: Uh, you should. A: Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something. A: I have real mixed feelings about it. A: I don't know. B: How, do you know how wrong they are? B: Are they, I mean, is there a margin of error? A: The accuracy? A: I don't know. A: I don't know. A: But, I know there are a lot of things that can influence them A: and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time. B: Yeah. A: And if you could show that, A: I, I interviewed for a job recently A: and I was taking Entex. And my doctor gave me a prescription for it. B: Uh-huh. A: And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive, you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you, you know. A: And it didn't come up that I needed to do it A: but this could happen to anybody A: and if they would just say oh, this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them you know. Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: So I don't know. B: And I, I'm not so sure they are that needed. *b A: Yeah, A: I'm not sure either. A: The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it, then they have the right to go ahead and prove it A: because they say they can spot check. B: if you're using it while at a job, I can see a problem. A: Yeah. B: But the occasional person, then it's almost like, it's almost an infringement of your privacy. A: Well, it sort of is. A: And this is it, A: this, A: I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways. A: You know, as a health professional, I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs. B: Yeah. A: You know, so as a patient, I feel well, yeah, we probably should be protected. A: But, on the other hand, there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too. A: So you know, I guess you sort of, you have to have trust some place along the way. B: Yeah. A: You can't go around testing everybody for everything. B: Yeah A: So, I don't know. A: And I, I think it could be used to hassle somebody. A: If someone was out to get you, I think that a company or a boss could use this. A: You know, they could keep on doing this to you or something, I guess. A: I can see where it could become a problem. B: And it, it's like, it seems like now they have tests B: I guess they can test your hair B: and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago. A: Really. maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. *sv B: So, B: I know. A: That's the other thing. A: I mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on A: and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever. B: Yeah. B: There's a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldn't do as an adult A: Yeah. B: but you can't say it was wrong at the time. A: I think that's true. A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: So that probably wouldn't be too good either. B: How many children do you have now? A: Well I have five. B: You have five? A: Right. B: Well you do have a hard time finding time then don't you? A: Well, five are, I mean four of them are grown, A: they're in college or just out of college A: so I really have just a thirteen year old at home. B: Uh-huh. B: You sound so young. A: Well, I work at it B: All right B: To have them, uh, A: I try to fool everybody B: I think you're doing a good job. B: I just have one child. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, I don't think, uh, B: well there's not much I can do about it. B: My, my wife and I are, in our forties, you know, B: so, uh A: Uh-huh. B: but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the, they're the pivot point of the universe. A: I think you are right A: because I was an only child too. A: And that's one reason I have so many because I really, I enjoy the big family. B: Yeah. A: And my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters A: and so she is sort of like an only child A: and it's the same type of thing, uh, B: Uh-huh. B: I have a younger brother like that. B: I'm in my forties, like I say B: and I have a brother in his twenties. A: Uh-huh. B: And I was, I was the youngest. A: Yeah. B: So I understand how that worked. B: And he was treated like he had five fathers or something. A: Right. A: That's exactly how it is, you know. A: She's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her. A: When things don't go right, she just calls one of them, you know. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, yeah, A: it, it's a little bit difficult, though. A: I think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and I was home more. A: And, B: Did you all do a lot of organized things like, uh, Little League, uh, soccer? A: We, we really did not. A: My next oldest daughter that's in college in California is a world twirling champion. A: She twirls a baton A: and we did a lot of things together. B: Uh-huh. A: She and I did a lot of things together and flew, A: we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform. B: Uh-huh. A: And that was a lot of fun. A: But that, that, I guess you could consider that organized. A: I mean, there is a competition all the time. B: Yeah. A: We were very heavy into that. A: Other than that, they were pretty much, A: and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that. B: You know, I think that's probably true. The, B: if you have one child or fewer, you get involved in organized events or activities A: Uh-huh. B: and if you have a large number of children or, then you don't. A: Well, you can't afford to. B: No, B: you B: and there's not enough time, uh A: Right. B: like my son is in, uh, Little League this year. B: He's ten. B: And they practice three times a week B: and they have a game B: and it's just, uh, if there were more than one child, I don't know, there would be no way to do it. A: Right. A: That's right. B: You know, one parent go one direction B: and I'd have to go in the other B: and we could only cover two at that. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Well I know I spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter A: and my little one also competed because really she had no choice. A: She had to go with me. B: Uh-huh. A: So the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and, and competing A: and, of course, the competing itself, really didn't matter what it was, A: it was making the friends and going all the places A: and it was a really neat experience, A: but it took our total time. A: I did not work, uh, when I did this. A: Now I do work full-time. B: Uh-huh. A: And it's just, my thirteen year old and myself A: and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other. A: So , B: I don't think, although B: I think a, a, more than one child, probably three children is probably the ideal to me B: but I'm not sure I could afford three. B: I most certainly couldn't educate three. B: I don't know how my, my parents did it. A: Yeah. B: I mean, there were five of us B: and I don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular. B: Uh, but I don't know how my father did it. B: He worked at a truck line B: and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children. B: But we did okay. B: We had a house and a home and, B: but now, my wife and I both work B: and we don't, I don't believe we have as much as my parents did B: and we only have one child. A: Really? B: Uh-huh. A: Well, things cost a lot more. A: I don't know how it is in Georgia B: Huh. A: and I don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some. B: Atlanta is horrible. A: Is it? B: Yes. B: we have a lot of people moving here from Boston and, and different areas B: and from talking to them, they're shocked. A: Really? B: and they, you know, B: the housing is so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it. A: Right. A: That's what I've heard. B: They sell their house, B: they stash away a good bit of money and come down here B: and I work with a lot of them, B: they, they think they, they have really done something. B: Then when they get down here, they realize the cost of living is outrageous compared to, to where they came from. A: Huh. A: Yeah. B: The housing is cheaper, B: but that's about it. A: I'm surprised to hear that. A: I've heard very positive things about Atlanta, B: Oh so , A: Okay. A: I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so B: Well, it, B: let's put it this way. B: We've got the New England Patriots up here B: so. A: Oh yeah. A: Right. Well, B: They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years. A: Really? B: Yeah. A: Why? B: Um, well, uh, partly due to ownership. B: You know, uh, Victor Kiam owned the, uh, the Patriots uh, for a period of a number of years A: Uh-huh. B: and he always had this, uh, this wonderful quality of being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something B: and, uh, they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth. B: And it recently was sold to, uh, some other people B: so, hopefully, this ownership can set up new direction and, uh, keep, uh, the Patriots in the New England area anyways A: Yeah. A: Well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you, B: Oh, yeah. B: I've been to a couple, I've been to a few games before. A: Uh-huh. B: Now you, you're, you're from Texas. A: Right. B: So you've got two football teams down there. A: Well, it depends on where you're from in Texas. A: I live right by Dallas so we have one football team as far as we're concerned B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, I see. A: That's how it is. B: There's that type of segregation, huh? A: It's divided, A: yeah. B: Wow! A: It really is, A: so we've got our Cowboys here A: and and, uh, I don't think anybody roots differently B: Uh-huh. A: but I have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno B: Do you, A: and he is for the L, the, uh, Raiders. L A Raiders, B: Uh-huh. A: so. B: Do you follow professional sports at all? A: Well, I just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well A: but I've been trying more this year. A: I think I know a little more than I use to. B: Yeah. A: I never knew very much at all A: so I'm trying B: Well, it's a good past time, you know. A: Yeah. B: Particularly football. B: They say, uh, football attracts more men because of the, you know, the, you see the, the physical aggression on the field B: and supposedly, psychologists say that, uh, that, uh, men take out their frustrations by watching football B: and, you know, they get together with a bunch of guys B: and they, uh, uh, and they have a good time and everything B: and that's suppose to be some of the, uh, the male bonding and the, and the, uh, the male instincts, I guess, or something about the, uh, A: So I shouldn't even try to do it, huh B: Well, no. B: It, it's good as, in terms of, in terms of, uh, of a contest. A: Yes. B: I think that, uh, B: I personally like hockey better because it has contact, it's a contact sport. B: It has the speed. A: Right. B: And the hand eye coordination B: and it takes a certain skill to play hockey. B: Not everybody can play hockey. A: Yeah. B: So we, B: and B: that's, B: we're a big hockey area up here, B: I bet up here in New England as well as, you know, in, in the Minnesota area A: Really . B: but, A: I don't even think we have that in Texas. B: What, hockey? A: We might. A: Do we? A: I mean, no A: you probably know, A: I don't know. B: No, B: there's no hockey, B: there's no A: Nobody talks about it A: so I don't think we do. B: There's no professional hockey teams in, in Texas A: No, A: uh-huh. A: And we have a soccer team that comes and goes. A: We don't even have that very much, A: so. B: Yeah. B: I think though that professional football in particular, is becoming so diluted now. A: Uh-huh. B: Like they have this World Football League. B: You see, we have the N F L that, that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and L A Raiders and those teams A: Yeah. B: There are those teams that play in professional, National Football League B: but, uh, now they have what's called the World Football League B: and they have all these teams from, B: there's a team in London B: and there's a team there, there's, uh, teams, other European teams A: Oh. B: and there's teams in the United States B: and they're playing now during the summer months B: and it's really you know, overkill A: Oh yeah. B: And there's only so much football you can watch. A: Yeah. A: Well, I like to do, A: I don't like to watch. B: Yeah, B: that's good. A: I don't like to watch anything. A: So it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff. A: I think it's an, excuse to do nothing A: and I, I can see what you're saying about the male bonding A: and the guys get together B: Yeah. A: and that's kind of cool. A: That's fun, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: But it can get really overdone. B: Now, have you ever been to a professional football game? A: Yeah, A: I have. B: Have you? A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: I have. B: Did you do the whole big, the whole thing, the tailgate party and the whole, A: Uh, no A: actually, no. B: Well see, now see that's what you got to do, see. B: Now we talked our, A: I've done that for college football. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: Yeah. B: You, the, B: well the same thing. A: Yeah. B: We, we talked our wives, B: there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games. B: And, uh, we talked our wives into going with us one time B: and they had a real good time B: and it was, basically, for the social atmosphere. A: Right. A: And that's the thing, you know. B: You go, you know three or four hours before the game. B: You go set up. B: We set a table up, B: we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat, drink some more. A: Yeah. B: But, but that whole, B: it, it's not so much, sure the contest itself and the game itself, A: Yeah. B: that you miss sitting home in your parlor, you know, uh, with, with a six pack of beer and some, uh, potato chips, you know A: That's right. B: you, you miss that. A: Yeah, A: that's right. B: And, and any professional sport I think, you miss that. A: Uh-huh. B: The atmosphere of being there, you know. A: Yeah. A: Well, in high school I went to every football game A: and, well, I twirled, you know. B: Yep. A: And I, you know, I didn't, A: I still don't know that much about football, obviously. A: But I still had a good time. You know, B: Well A: think about this? B: Uh, do you have children in school? A: I do. B: Uh, I have two that are, uh, now just about ready to graduate from college A: Uh. B: but I also have two that are just entering school. Uh, well *sv I think they're just pushing them entirely to fast. A: So you see a big difference then in before and now do you A: or, A: A lot of testing? B: Uh, well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade. A: Uh-huh. B: My son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock. A: Uh-huh. B: And I think that's such a long day for a kindergartner. A: I do too, A: I, oh, I think that's awful. B: And, uh, I have a preschooler. B: Uh, I was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten B: and I thought well how mature do you have to be A: I know. A: What's the new criteria, huh. B: And, uh, there is a, B: do you have the standardized testing now? A: We have all kinds of testing A: and it's over and over. A: It's I T B S or, and, uh, just everything, everything. B: Yeah. A: And they test, test, test. A: I live in Plano actually A: and I don't know if you've heard of Plano A: but it's a very transient community. B: No. A: A lot of people from everywhere, A: it's just north of Dallas B: Uh-huh. A: and it's grown in leaps and bounds. A: I, we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now. B: Oh. A: And most of them from other places. B: Yeah. A: Uh, J C Penney's come down from New York and, of course, T I and Xerox from Rochester A: and we just, have lots of people from everywhere. Lots of industry coming in, B: Yeah. A: and it's a very wealthy community. A: Uh, not that I am A: but other people seem, to be A: and I would love to know why A: but I mean they do. A: They have, B: you would like to know what they're doing right A: I, I would, A: I really would. A: I mean, they just have beautiful, beautiful homes A: and they have everything. A: The kids only wear name brand things to school A: and it's one of these things, B: Oh me. B: Well that makes it hard for you, doesn't it. A: Well it does, you know. A: It really does because I'm a single mom and I have a thirteen year old now A: and uh, you know, it does. B: Oh, me. A: I mean, we do it to a point A: but uh, not to where she feels different, B: Yeah. A: but some of them are very rich B: It's hard to explain to them why you can't. A: and so, uh, we just kind of have, everything here A: and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are. B: Right. A: And so I don't know how much of it, is us and how much of it is Texas A: but the kids are expected to excel in, everything. B: Oh, dear. A: And it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first A: and they're expected to be. B: Right. A: You know, their parents expect it, A: the teachers expect it, A: Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system B: Right A: and if you read national surveys, they're far from it. A: And so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests. B: How about the kids. B: How are they coping with it? A: Well, not very well. A: They bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before, tests. B: Huh. A: I mean they make a big deal. A: To me, the paper should just be put on the desk that day A: and say just do this. B: Right. A: You know, I just feel they do better that way. B: Yeah. B: Rather than anticipating. A: And, A: Yeah. A: And, and I have older children too that now are out of high school A: and they've always done this here. A: I mean it's always been the same A: but it is, it's getting worse and worse, A: is more pressure for everything. *listen A: And I just think it's really awful A: and I, I'm with you on that. A: You don't hear too many people say this, A: but I think it's a very long day. B: Oh, it is. A: And my feeling is that, you know, you're only a kid once, and you don't want to spend your whole life in school. B: That's right. B: My son said that, came home B: and he said, he said Mom, all we do is work. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: We hardly ever play B: and, A: And I don't think that's right. A: I think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system. B: Oh, likewise. A: I don't think I should have to pay for dancing lessons, gymnastics, piano. B: Right. A: I would like to see those things included in our school system because I think we should have well-rounded kids not just book smart kids. B: Wouldn't that be great. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: And so I just find this a real problem. A: I think if they're going to be there all day, they should find time. A: One of my daughters, once, was out of school with Mono in her junior year I think it was. A: And she had a home teacher for like four hours a week A: and when she went back in six weeks, she was ahead. A: So what does that tell you? B: Is that right? A: It tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time. B: Oh, my gosh. B: Oh, my gosh. A: And they could be using this time better. B: Well, for example, in my son's kindergarten. They're really finished at lunch time. B: After lunch, they have some, uh, B: I'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch, B: and then they have naps or rest period. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, I think either send them home or do something a little more interesting. A: That's a very long day for kindergartners. B: I agree. A: But I think that working parents have kind of demanded this. B: I wouldn't be surprised. A: You know, because they don't, they don't want to send them to daycare. B: I doubt if they would say it was too long A: That's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day B: Uh, do you have the before school care, at your school and the after school care? A: We have them at one school like, A: This is Archie. B: Hi, Archie. B: I'm Sharon. A: Have you seen DANCING WITH WOLVES? B: Yeah. B: I've seen that, B: that's, uh, that was a really good movie. B: Probably one of the best things about it was the scenery B: and, uh, I thought the story was pretty good, too. B: I, I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it. A: Have you ever lived in that part of the country? B: No. B: I haven't. A: Have you ever visited it? B: Um, I've visited the Wyoming area. B: I'm not sure exactly where DANCES WITH WOLVES was filmed. A: I think it was the black hills of South Dakota. B: Could be. B: I, I haven't been to South Dakota. B: Have, have you been up to that? A: Well, I lived in Omaha for five, winters, B: Oh. B: Okay. A: and that rolling kind of, uh, B: Terrain. A: Yeah. A: Is, is fairly . A: The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics, A: apparently it's going to win everything. B: Really? A: Uh, and I had been told, you know, you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long, and all this, kind of, B: That's true. B: I agree with that. B: Um, I, I noticed yesterday in the paper, something said that it, B: I think it's been nominated for twelve awards B: and, and all the critics initially said that, you know, it wouldn't go anywhere, that it was just going to be a dud. B: So, it, it has surprised everybody. A: Well, the interesting thing was is I had heard that, A: and I, I, I tend to, I think, overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great. A: And, and it was, the thing is, it was, it was a good story. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: And, and, and I guess that's what I really like. A: Although, I must admit I did look at my watch after about an hour. B: Did you? A: Yeah. B: Have you seen SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY? A: No. A: I've heard, I've heard that's really great, though. B: you have to go see that one. B: And how about SILENCE OF THE LAMB? A: No, B: Go. A: You must really keep up. B: I do. B: I go every weekend B: I, I, uh, B: those are two definite must see movies, I think. A: Well, isn't, isn't SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, isn't that a, A: is it, is it a terror movie A: or is it just suspenseful? B: It's suspenseful. B: I don't think it's very B: I mean, there's not really any, uh, blood and guts in it or anything like that. B: It's, it's more suspense. B: Um, the other one, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, is kind of a, a gory movie, if, if somebody's not into that kind of stuff. B: It's, it's pretty graphic at points. B: But, uh, I think they're both excellent movies. A: Do you, do you listen to Gary Cogill? B: No. Huh-uh. *two utts A: Is, uh, A: do you know who he is? B: Yeah. B: Somebody in South Carolina told me about him. A: He's a, the movie critic. A: Um, oh, you've, oh, A: okay. A: He's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas. B: Yeah. A: And he does, uh, he has a talk show on the, K L I F. A: Anyway, it's on from seven to nine, or something. A: And, and, and people call in A: and it's, if you keep up with movies, it's kind of interesting. A: There's a certain a mount of dribble that they do. A: They've got, uh, they've got a couple of kids, ten or twelve years old, A: and they call in A: and they review movies. A: But it's, uh B: Oh. A: he, anyway, he, A: it's interesting. A: You listen to him A: and then you, you go watch the movie. A: In fact, they had, people had just seen, A: I was listening Sunday night a little bit when, I was going to pick up my daughter. B: Uh-huh. A: But, anyway, it was, uh, the, A: it, it's interesting, though, A: or did he just do it? B: I think that, I think he really, B: his heart was in it, B: but I, I don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was. B: I think it was something that he really wanted to do. B: He wanted to direct it, B: he wanted to, to star in it. B: You know, he, he enjoyed the story line B: and I think he just really he really wanted it. B: And whether it, whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office, I think he would have been happy. B: Because I think that, I think he did a good job B: and, and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him. A: Do you know who the guy was that was playing the, uh, the, the wagon driver? B: Um. A: A little piece of trivia. A: You know, the guy when he first headed out from the army post. B: Yeah. B: Who, B: no B: I don't know who that guy is. A: He, he plays on MURPHY BROWN. B: Oh, he does? A: Yes. A: He's, he's Eldon, her housepainter. B: As a recurring character every week? B: Oh. A: Can you, believe that? B: No, B: now see, I'd, I'd a never put those two together. A: That's, that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said, did you notice that? B: Huh-uh. A: I thought, no, it's really funny. A: But I thought, it, it, A: you think back, A: and yeah, A: it was him, but with a you know, with the beard and all that stuff. B: Yeah. A: I mean, it's, uh, B: Yeah, B: real scruffy looking A: Yeah. A: Real scruffy looking, A: and it it was really funny, it's, uh, that, that he winds up playing in the movie. A: But I thought, it's good that, you know, A: it was a lot of fun. B: Yeah. A: I don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go A: but we're at about five minutes. A: I should think we've done enough. B: You think so? B: I mean, I haven't been watching my watch. B: Um, I guess, B: yeah. B: Does it usually cut off? B: Is that what, it does? A: Well, I don't know. A: Why do we end this thing? B: It used to, it used to just automatically cut off A: I think it just says hang up. B: but it says when the conversation is over just say your good-byes and hang up. B: So, I, I guess so. A: Why don't we do that? B: Okay. A: Good-bye Sharon. B: Good talking to you Archie A: Uh, well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes? B: We, uh, B: well, uh, my, my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class. A: Uh-huh. B: He's an aerobics instructor. And, um, is going to be, uh, entering North Texas for uh, a Kinesiology program there. *two utts? A: Uh-huh. B: And, um, the, the B: how I met him was through, uh, the aerobics class that he used to teach. A: Uh-huh. A: You're a student? B: Yeah, B: so. I'm, I'm an avid aerobics, uh, person and just very, very athletic. A: Uh-huh. B: Enjoying a you know, uh, anything dealing with sports. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: So, and how do you feel about it? A: Uh, I'm, I am a person who wishes I had more time to exercise. A: I, I don't feel like I, A: I don't very often do things for the sake of exercise. A: I don't feel well unless I am exercising A: and I try to do things that involve exercise, A: but, I very rarely do things like, um, A: I've never done aerobics or any sort of structured, A: this is my exercise time B: Uh-huh. A: but, I do lots of outdoor sports and things, bicycling, uh, you know, mountaineering, a little mountaineering, this and that, A: and I spend a lot of time A: and I probably get more exercise than your average person. A: But, it's not a, a structured sort of thing, A: and I have to admit I have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake, B: Uh-huh. A: and perhaps, it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun, or something like that. B: Yeah, B: well I, I've, B: my, B: that's the way my mother stands on it. B: She feels like if it's something that you have to do, you know, if you look at it as if you have to do it, then it becomes, it becomes a chore, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Yes, A: yes. B: and, and, she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore. B: So, um, and I feel that way too as far as, you know, just sitting and doing, you know, to, the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something, you know, B: to, A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: you're a you know B: calculated down B: and do your calisthenics, you know, three times a week A: Uh-huh. B: or, but, but I do try and, um, I do try and regulate how much exercise I get a week. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: Is that why you like aerobics classes, because you're not, sort of, someone else is doing the counting for you, so, it makes it less of a chore? B: Yeah. B: And, it's got, B: and I've always enjoyed dance. A: Yeah. B: So it involves, you know, B: I, I can't get out to dance all the time B: and, A: Yeah, A: would that we could B: Yeah, B: and it's, and it's more regulated, B: I mean you're, you're using different parts of the body. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: So, it, it is like dance, B: and it's structured like that, B: but you have the music, and someone, like you said, someone else is counting, so, it makes it easier for me. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: And, someone else is telling me, okay, you know, let's move this way, let's move that way, instead of me having to think about it so much. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Right. A: You can just trust someone else to give you full exercise A: and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: But, I'm like you, B: I also, um, like to participate in, uh, things like, B: well, we just went to the, uh, Myererson Symphony Run this past weekend, B: and, and that was a lot of fun B: and you get to meet different people, and, um, just get out, you know, out and about, A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: and it's, it, it's something you can all, B: like our, B: we did it as a family, B: so, it was, it was quite a lot of fun. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and, biking B: and I, I, I love to swim, B: so I love it when, you know, it's swimming weather, A: Um. B: and, uh, A: Well, you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming weather B: Oh, B: I didn't realize that. A: Uh B: I'm sorry. B: Well, I'm in Texas. B: I, I just assumed that I had, B: this is the first call I've done, A: Uh-huh. B: and, I didn't realize that they were going to reach out to people from, all over the country. B: You wouldn't know that B: Oh, I, A: So, it's the, it's, it's the, the well it's actually, A: it's interesting, because there are real regional differences. A: Um, in California there's, uh, almost an assumption, um, unless you're, sort of, clearly of an older generation, or something, you know, in your sixties, or something like that, A: I'm, I'm, I'm not. Uh, A: there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness, and, and, at least in urban California. A: And, maybe not, A: I don't know about rural California too well. A: But, in urban California it's just, you know, A: for all I know aerobics started out here. A: I don't know where they actually started, A: but they, you know, the craze really picked up big here A: and before that there was the running craze. A: And, they, A: California gets, you know, tends to be a bit faddish, A: but, the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere. B: Uh-huh. A: So, there must be something to some of them. A: And, uh, B: Well, I think people are, are more um, um, B: people from California seem to be more health motivated all around. I mean, as far as the diet, and everything. Uh, the diet and, uh, just your health consciousness, B: and, I mean, it just, seems like, uh, a lot of those ideas generate out of California. A: Uh-huh. B: Not just exercise, but, health, health related ideas. A: Yeah. B: And, I, B: it's curious, I don't know why, don't know if it's, B: do you, B: does California have a, A: Well, there's a sense of it being a package, A: I think. There, there is a sense of, you know, whole, A: there's a lot of, you know, A: you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or whatever. A: And, uh, oh the, the, the University of California at Berkeley puts out THE WELLNESS LETTER. Which is, uh, turned into a fairly well subscribed to, uh, newsletter, monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that B: Uh-huh. A: and, and, it doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or anything. A: It, it's on fairly solid scientific ground. A: Uh, it's just dispensed with these distinctions. A: It says all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another, so that they, they combined them all together. A: And, uh, so it's had that orientation for quite some time. A: Um, there's been some progressive medical schools out here, that have taken that approach. B: Uh-huh A: And, um, B: Now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole health, that, the, you know, you have to have that combination, or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program. A: Boy, B: Do you think the program came first or the, A: yeah, A: that, A: there's a, A: I, I can say there's a correlation, but I couldn't say which, which caused the other. A: They sort of, you know, each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more, and a little bit more. B: Yeah, B: the more money they put into it. A: Yeah. A: And, B: I can see that. B: And, cause, I, B: knowing B: from institutes of learning like that, I know that they've got to get their money somewhere, B: and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it, and believe in it, B: so, A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: Exactly. A: And, part of it is California, you know, in, back in the sixties, had a lot of alternative movements A: and some of them fizzled out A: and some of them were disastrous A: and others of them, um, had an impact on the society around here. A: And one of the ones that had an impact was, uh, people becoming interested in alternate practices, A: I'm not sure if it was a meditation practice, or if it was, you know, which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to, uh, A M A approved medicine. A: Uh, you have, you know, major, um, acupuncture schools and things out here. A: And, and you could have them around long enough A: and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things, B: Uh-huh. A: and, before long, you, you get this, this whole kind of Gestalt, this whole package of, of health, of health care and options B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, and exercise is, is strongly considered one of them. A: The irony is, is its people in the cities, in my experience, that are most oriented towards doing the exercise. A: And, I guess because they spend all day in back of their desks. A: The average person out on the farm, at least traditionally, now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally, the laborers, B: Yeah. A: last thing, B: Or they're older. A: Pardon me. B: Well, don't you think they tend to be older in the rural B: I, I sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city. A: Oh, like everything else. B: I live in a rural area, you know, I see that. *sd A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: The rat race to exercise B: It's, yeah, it's, it's like it's frantic, to, A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: well I, I think so. B: as a fit person A: I mean you, you've, A: if you look at if you look at other cultures, A: like I know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in China A: and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all. A: But, they do a lot of low keyed, low impact, low stress exercise, A: and they combine it with a, you know, meditation or whatever. Some sort of relaxation B: Uh-huh. A: and, they seem pretty, you know, A: they don't have the hard body. A: They don't have that perfect look, A: and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious. A: But they, you know, they live to a hundred and ten some you know, B: Yeah, A: And, that, that's, B: Well, don't you think a lot of that is diet too? A: and, a lot of that is diet. A: That's true. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I mean, they eat, they eat a lot of carbohydrates, and not much fat. Um, for economical reasons, not for preference. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, B: Yeah B: and as we can see. B: Well, I'm a, I'm a practicing vegetarian B: so, uh, I've read a lot of information, knowing that to be true, A: Yeah A: am I actually. B: What's that? A: I, as am I. B: Oh, are you also A: Yes B: Well that's, that's good as far as the B: is that, is that, um, pretty predominant as far as California A: It is in the urban areas, A: yes. B: In the urban areas? A: Most, for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh that's wonderful. A: Well most, most, sort of modern looking restaurants will, B: Yeah. A: you can, B: That's great, B: I mean, we, uh, B: it's such a it's such a trouble here. B: I mean, you just have to eat at home basically. A: I was wondering that, A: because I was actually applying for a job in Texas, A: and, and, and, uh, it occurred to me, B: Well of course in the cities, B: yeah, B: well, in the cities, B: we live close to Dallas, A: Uh-huh. B: so, uh, which, you know, B: you get, uh, an influx of a lot of people from all over the country, B: so, you're going to have a lot of more choices, A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: but, but, in urban areas it's, you know, steak places, A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: an, and it's not a, you know, A: Yeah. B: it's, uh, it's definitely, B: it, it's, it's changing to a degree, And, even, even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or, uh, organic, you know, materials, and foods and things. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: You don't really have that, B: I mean, you would think. A: All righty . A: Uh, I'll just hand it off to you A: and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today. B: Well, uh, the hobbies that I pursue in my spare time, are crafts B: and, uh, I've been involved in making, uh, hat stands and, uh, rag dolls and, uh, different type hats with, uh, flowers and roses, you know, and, uh, that kind of thing, straw hats and, all that kind of stuff. A: Oh like typing noises in B: And I enjoy it, B: it's relaxing. B: And you kind of get absorbed in it B: so the time goes by, you know, before you realize anything is going on. B: And I play the organ sometimes, uh, just for my own satisfaction Not for anybody else's ears B: because I'm not that good at it, B: but I like to bang on the keyboards once in a while. A: Oh really? B: How about yourself? A: Well, oh, hobbies, gee whiz, A: I guess I got too many hobbies A: so I never have time to deal with them. B: Really? A: I like photography a lot, B: Oh, yeah, B: that's neat. A: uh, I used to do that a lot A: and then I like, um, A: we have a new child that will be a year old here next week, A: so I'll take a lot of pictures of her, you know, and spoil them, B: Oh, that's great, B: uh-huh. A: first one, you know how that is. A: And, um, uh, I play the guitar and a banjo. A: I mainly play the guitar a lot, A: I play about every night. A: And, um, I really love that, A: if I had a druther , A: if I could have, if I could make it on the road, I'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something, A: because that's, A: I've, B: Oh, that sounds nice. B: I like bluegrass, too. A: yeah, A: I've done it before and when I was in in high school and college, and thoroughly enjoyed it, B: Uh-huh. A: and it's really a, a blast. A: My wife hates it, A: but that's the way life is, I guess. B: That's the hard part, right? A: Exactly. B: If you can do things together, that really helps a lot. A: yeah, A: we, uh, A: she's, uh, into aerobics, A: and, uh, and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half B: Oh, that's good, too. A: and that went over real well, B: Uh-huh. A: but, uh, that's about it there. B: Oh, it's good B: and it's healthy, too. A: Oh, yeah, A: yeah. B: We do that too, B: we have a, uh, a treadmill and, uh, a bicycle and that kind of stuff, B: we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week, you know. A: Oh, that's great. B: Yeah. A: That's great. B: And we like movies, B: that B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: that's, uh, A: spare time, A: with a child it's, kind of A: she's, A: we have, uh, A: we're looking for a baby-sitter A: so we've been out twice in in this year so far. By ourselves without the child B: Uh-huh. A: so it's kind of, uh, become an issue you could say. B: Sure. A: Um, hobbies, A: I like, messing around in your house building things, and, you know, putting cabinets up, and, those kind of things, um, B: Oh yeah, B: that's great, too. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: we did some remodeling when we bought a house, B: we built, put a kitchen in and, um, that kind of stuff, and painting and some wallpapering, B: that's fun. A: It's really kind of fun. B: It is. B: It really is. A: Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty, A: yeah. B: Yeah, B: exactly. B: I like things that, you know, two people can do, B: but I like the quiet of doing things away, you know, B: kind of gives you some space for yourself, B: and that's what I find in making the dolls and things, that it gives me something that I can create, B: and I like to crochet and knit. B: I made some afghans and that kind of stuff. B: I like doing things with my hands. A: Uh-huh. A: Sounds like it. B: Yeah. A: Do you like to cook? B: Yes, B: I love to cook. A: Yeah, A: I love to cook, too, A: I'm, uh, B: Italian food A: Oh, really? B: Yeah, B: pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff. A: Well, we're all skinny farts A: so, I, A: it, A: so when it comes to, A: I like to cook and eat and, to have, mainly, I guess, I get to B: Yeah. A: amount of people eat, *listen and then say, man this is really good, B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: it is. A: um, um, but it just, A: work in the garden, work around the yard, of course, B: Do you do barbecues? A: Yes, A: we sure do, A: smoke them B: Well, uh, uh, smoking and all that stuff? A: Oh, yeah, A: all that hoedown stuff. B: Yeah, B: yep, A: All that stuff that's bad for you. B: I, I lived in Abilene for a little while, and, uh, worked in the Abilene plant, A: Oh, sure, A: yeah. B: and we used to go to Joe Allen's Barbecue, B: and, uh, oh, that was great. A: Oh, yeah. B: Really great, A: That's, uh, only way to do it. B: they have some nice stuff down there. B: I miss it A: Well, yeah, A: it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, A: there's, uh, there's pluses to everything, B: Oh, yeah. A: but, you know, seems like there's just so many things to do down here, A: I like the sports, A: I play a lot of racquetball. B: We did, I did horseback riding, too, B: in fact, when my children were growing up, we always had horses B: and, uh, that was kind of for them, B: but they weren't as interested in it as we were, you know, B: so, uh, that was a real, B: I'd say probably for maybe fifteen years, we dabbled in that, you know, B: we always had horses around, B: and I really enjoyed that, A: Oh, that's great, A: sounds like you, B: and I was disappointed when I went to Texas. B: I didn't see that many of them. A: Horses? B: Yes A: Yeah, A: you really don't. A: Yeah, A: the, A: you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete, uh, B: I know, B: I know, B: it's true. A: there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people A: and that's about it down here, A: and so, B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: But, uh, that's great. A: Well, sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there. B: Yeah, B: you too, B: you too. A: Well, great, A: well look, uh, A: I know it's probably late for you, B: Okay. A: I enjoyed speaking with you B: Me too. A: have a good weekend. B: Okay. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye, now. with children today. B: Uh, we made a point to spend a lot of quality time B: and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were involved in, you know, like, uh, through scouting or you know, anything like that A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: we participated. B: And, uh, we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now. A: Wow, that's great. B: When, B: yeah, B: when, uh, the kids were in high school, it was harder to always have supper together, B: but we did always have breakfast together. A: Uh-huh. B: So, we, we had supper together as much as possible, B: but when it wasn't feasible, you know, we kind of kept a master calendar and when it wasn't feasible, well, that was understandable, A: Uh-huh. B: but uh, we've always tried to spend time to talk and, uh, have some time, together time A: Yeah. B: and we sat around the table, B: we didn't sit in front of a T V or that kind of thing. A: Wow, that's great. B: So I think that's been important, because we do have a close family A: Uh-huh. B: and even though the kids are basically, uh, grown, uh, they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and uh, have spoken before of, they want that kind of, you know, situation for them when, you know, and their children when they marry and have children. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: kind of goes on. B: Uh-huh. A: They do what they see, you know. B: That's right. B: They model B: and, with the dysfunctional families today, I'm sure, with a, as a schoolteacher also, you see what happens to these kids when these families never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the, between, uh, oh, second families, uh, one parent families or all those kinds of problems that they have A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. B: and then you see them magnified in the children. A: Yeah. A: Plus, you teach middle school, A: so I'm sure that, B: Oh, boy, B: yes. A: You are really, you really, A: boy, oh, boy. A: I taught early childhood B: Uh-huh. A: so I had the little ones. B: Yes. A: And, uh, you know, I saw it there, too, A: and you, you know, you just oh, it's, it's, kind of an eye-opener. B: It is. A: So, B: It is. B: And I think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children A: Uh-huh. B: and I think we make a point to do that. A: Yeah, A: I think you're right. B: Because we see we see all the time, the outcome of not doing that A: Yeah. B: and I think if we weren't so interested in children, in child care, then we wouldn't be teaching anyway. A: Right. B: So, A: Right. B: Uh, I wish we could reach more of the rest of the world A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: I think, uh, the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools, B: it's what's happening in the families. A: I agree, A: yeah. B: And, uh, they expect us to, you know, have, create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers A: Yeah. B: and you get to a point where it's completely impossible. A: Yeah, A: I agree. A: I, I know exactly what you're saying B: And you just get more and more frustrated B: and yet, you feel for the, the kids. B: You do the best you can B: but, A: Okay, A: uh, what do you consider an invasion of privacy? B: Uh, I was just now told that's what the topic was B: and, uh, I guess invasion of privacy, uh, to me, for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards for example. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, I guess recently one of the T V stations here, uh, ran a series of, uh, news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers. And use it A: It's very easy. B: and I was quite surprised at that. B: I guess I can consider myself fortunate that, uh, it never happened to me. A: Now, I've never, I've never had that happen to me either. B: I don't know what I'd really do if it did. A: What do you think about places, A: like I was in Michael's the other night and charged something, A: and they asked for my home phone even though, you know, the charge had been approved. A: What do you think of that? B: Uh, A: Does it bother you to give it? B: No, B: not really because I'm listed in the phone book. B: If I was the type of individual that, uh, had an unlisted number, I, I think I would be hesitant to give it. A: You know that they, they now have a, uh, I believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets. B: One of the things that upset me when I lived in California was, uh, they did a lot of things with your Social Security number. A: Security number, A: uh-huh. B: As a matter of fact, they even went to the point of printing our Social Security number on your driver's license. A: Oh. B: And they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number, B: so we had our Social Security numbers imprinted on our checks. A: Uh, uh-huh. B: And I was really, you know, unhappy about that situation. B: I think that was an invasion of privacy. A: Privacy, A: yes, A: yes. A: I can see, you know, where that was. A: I, I don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given, you know, when I have to cash a check. A: I don't see any need for it when I'm charging something, A: but I, neither am I a person that has the guts to say, no, A: I'm not going to give it to you, either B: Right. A: You know, and, uh, B: One of the biggest things, I think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of, uh, mail lists and things like that. A: Yes, A: yes. B: You know, uh, recently we, uh, I purchased some magazines, U S NEWS and FORBES magazine. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And every since that day, I have been inundated with, you know, uh, subscriptions to this, subscriptions to that, uh, this news letter, this investment letter, uh, even to the point of people calling me at home. B: And prior to me ordering these magazines, I never got those kind of calls. A: Right, A: right. B: And, A: I discovered with, uh, charge cards, uh, I feel like that I don't know whether it's the stores themselves that sell the list or whether the, uh, uh, credit report bureau sells it, A: but I get catalogs from people I've never even heard of. B: Uh-huh. A: And I know they have to be coming from my charge cards, you know. B: From some, some list, B: yeah. A: From some list, you know, that knows that I have a, say a charge account at, at Neiman's or something A: because then I'll get catalogs that, you know, are within that range that I would never order from ordinarily, B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: and, uh, you know, and I get, I get tired of that. A: I, because I look at all that junk mail, A: and I think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up you know, all their time to sort B: All their time. A: and they're not even paying full postage. B: Sure. A: You know, and if you did away with some of that, our postal service might give better service. B: I think the general public would be, you know, uh, tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for, uh, let's say the criminal individuals to, to get access to people's records, uh, their credit cards driver's licenses, checks, things like that. A: Right. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I don't think anybody really knows what to do about it. A: No, A: no. B: Computers caused a lot of this, I'm sure. A: Well, you know, let's face it, A: computers can be gotten into very easily if you, if you really have the, the know with all, if you're, you know, so inclined to, uh, oh, what do I want to say, have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that. You know, and have a basic knowledge, B: Sure. A: they're very easy to get into. A: To tap into a system. B: Seems as though they are, B: yeah. A: Uh-huh, you know, A: and, uh, which is scary, A: I mean, you know, our lives are on computers. B: Unfortunately. A: And, uh, and I don't know, A: I kind of, I resent the calls of an evening trying to sell me something. A: Uh, B: Fortunately, I haven't, uh, haven't, uh, been inundated with that situation yet. A: We are constantly, it seems like. A: I don't know why. A: You know, either wanting to clean our carpet, sell us storm windows, A: Okay, Jerry, A: I guess tonight's topic is about recycling. B: Uh-huh. A: And I'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in Plano. B: All right. A: Right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the, by the collection agency or the, the city along with your garbage can. A: Uh, you can put out newspaper, A: you can put out glass, A: you can put out aluminum cans, A: you can put, put out certain types of plastic material A: and that is on a roll out effort right now. A: Not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and, uh, participate right now, A: but, uh, that will be rolled out to everyone, I hope, in the next year or so. A: And those that aren't participating, they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum. A: And I think, uh, overall that's an, an excellent opportunity A: because I hate to see our landfills being filled up and, uh, growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for not only the people that are living today, but for the future also. A: So, B: Yeah, B: uh, I was A: How about your community? B: My community, B: that's cute. B: I live in a place called Dye Mound. A: Dye Mound? B: Or Dye Community. A: Uh-huh. B: And it's not a city, not incorporated, B: my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least, B: I can't even see their house B: and, uh, A: Sounds like a place where I grew up B: Yeah, B: I mean, uh, I'm out in, I'm out in the wilderness. Literally. A: Well, I like it. B: And, uh, well, give you an idea, B: it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete, I mean, to the asphalt, B: we're out there. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, we, I do some interesting recycling things. A: Well, good. B: I'm building our house right now B: and I'm going to incorporate into my, uh, garage area a weight activated, uh, crusher. A: Oh, okay. B: So when I drive the car in the, in the driveway in the afternoon, it, it will just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the, the, uh, pressure side of a, uh, hydraulic cylinder. A: Uh-huh. B: And the weight of the car will crush, what's ever in the disposer. A: Oh. B: hopefully, it's not my wife. A: Well, let's hope not. A: You can be, uh, get in trouble for that. B: Well, I thought I'd, you know, I'd use it as a, an escapement type thing. B: I don't know if you're familiar with that operation, B: but, what you do is you just build up the pressure A: Uh-huh. B: and then you go over and release it B: and then it just, it just drops, you know. A: Well, it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack, isn't it? B: Very similar, B: yeah. A: Okay, A: okay. B: Well, what, what it will be, you just, you drive up on the jack, B: but you, it won't go down. A: Yes, A: until you release it. B: Until you pull the pin, B: yeah. A: All right. B: Anyway I have another, uh, recycling method I use. A: I think, A: Yes. B: You know all that junk mail you get? A: Oh, yes, A: I sure do. B: The glossy paper that says, buy this, and send off for that and you have won and all that. A: Uh-huh. B: Well, anytime they send me a return envelope I put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that I, you know, happen to gather up. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh. B: Because, uh, well, like I say, we live a way B: and when you throw trash away, you throw it in my yard. A: Yes. B: And I don't like that A: No. B: so I don't do that. B: So I take it B: and I send, and I mail it back to them. A: Well, great. A: That's excellent. B: I've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff. A: Well, uh, if a lot of people did that, then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail. A: That's a great idea. A: I hadn't thought about that A: and we might be able to incorporate some of that. A: One thing, B: Yeah. B: Well, I think one of the, the best ways to eliminate, uh, or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items. A: Right. B: For instance, uh, I saw a thing on, uh, NOVA, I think it was the other day. A: Uh-huh. B: This guy has designed recyclable materials, I mean recyclable items. A: Right. B: Whatever he makes, it's all out of the same thing. A: Oh. B: See, so, plastic, it's all out of plastic. A: Yes. B: If it's metal, it's all out of metal. B: It's, he's a design, he's a engineer, designing stuff. A: Well, that's a great idea, A: that's a great idea. B: And, and, incorporating, you know, reusable materials into your, uh, you know, your assembly line into your actual scheme of product operations is is the only way to really do it on a, on a broad scale. A: Products. A: Yes. B: Make it financially, uh, attractive to recycle A: Uh-huh. B: and somebody will find a way to make money at it. A: Yes, A: they will. B: And, A: Exactly. B: Well, there is a guy in Dallas, B: that's all he does. A: Huh. B: He collects trash. You know, B: and, A: Well, that's a full time job. B: Yeah, B: well, he's, he's out for cardboard. A: Yes, A: well, I've found out, too, that, uh, you know, a couple years ago, A: we've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years, A: and at one time we could get a pretty good return, uh, with the Boy Scouts. A: We could take and collect the newspaper, A: So, are you a news person? B: Uh, I really am, B: I enjoy, I enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as I can. Although, you know, I'm a full time student B: and I work full time, too, B: so, or not full time, B: but I work quite a bit B: and so so I mostly depend on the radio, you know, on the way to work. A: Yes. B: I like, I like to listen to national public radio, uh, all things considered. A: Yes, A: great show. B: Yeah, B: and I like to listen to that and catch, you know, B: I don't get, I don't get a lot of, uh, sometimes I don't get the current events, you know. Because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with, uh, you know, some important issue on the day. B: But, A: Yeah, A: so, so the real, the real current news and, the hard news is, is not, there is not really enough of it there. B: Yeah. B: Right, B: that's right, B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: I've had, I've had that frustration, too. A: I end up switching stations from time to time. B: Yeah B: Yeah, B: you, you you like N P R uh, programming? A: Uh, in general. B: Yeah. A: Uh, I watch a lot of C N N uh, and C SPAN. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, I, I subscribe to three newspapers. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, you know, I sort of can't get enough of this. B: Yeah. A: And, and I, when I travel elsewhere, I'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have. Of world, world events and national events. B: Oh, yeah. B: Oh, yeah. A: Well, in, in Dallas, what are the, what is the newspaper situation? B: Well we we, we have a, a big newspaper situation. B: Uh, because, we used to have two newspapers up until, uh, last Sunday B: and a, uh, major, uh, a, one of our major papers just closed down. B: They closed shop, and said, well, we can't put any more papers out, B: we're done. A: Was, was that the, the better paper A: or , B: Yeah, B: I thought so. B: It was a, it was a more effective paper as far as I was concerned. B: It, it had, uh, uh, it got to the news, you know, and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy. Uh, which I like. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't, I don't like to, you know, I like to save the editorial information or the the politically, uh, weighted information, you know, for the, for a different section. B: I like just to get to the, you know, find out what's happening pretty quick. A: Yes. B: And I feel that the other newspaper, uh, B: the the DALLAS MORNING NEWS is the one that's still here. B: The TIMES HERALD is the one that closed up A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, the, the MORNING NEWS was, was, is okay, B: but, you know, you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as I'm concerned. A: Uh-huh. B: You know, many times it doesn't doesn't reflect my own opinion B: and, A: But if you, if you were to look at the front page of today's MORNING NEWS MORNING TIMES rather, would you, would you see things about what is going on in Europe? B: Uh-huh. B: No, B: no, B: that's the problem. A: Oh. B: But, you know, you see, you see Troy Aikman's knee surgery on the front page, you know. A: Whoever Troy Aikman is. B: Yeah, B: a, a quarterback for the Broncos or for the, for the Cowboys. A: Okay. B: Uh, you know, you know, you know what I mean A: Yeah. B: that, there is, uh, local news that, uh, that really a lot of times doesn't, doesn't change, change my life one way or the other. A: Yeah. B: So, uh, A: I guess it's current events, but not the kind of current events that changes the world. B: Right, B: right, B: yeah B: Not something you'll, you'll, uh, be interested in ten years from now by any means. You know. A: Yeah. B: How, how about you? B: Uh, I guess in Washington, D C you guys have several papers that are pretty pretty effective don't you? A: Yes. A: A lot of them. A: I, I rather like the WASHINGTON POST. B: Yeah. A: But, I also get the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, and, uh, each of them covers different things in, in in different ways B: Right. A: and so it's, you know, if I only looked at one of them I would have a different clearly would have a different perspective on the world. B: Right, B: yeah. B: Uh, I, I have a question. B: Uh, does, does the WALL STREET JOURNAL, uh, B: I, I've kind of gathered lately that, uh, maybe their information is not just only related to business. B: Is that, is that a correct assumption? A: That, that is certainly true. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, they will, they will have articles, A: like a few days ago they had a, a nice article on Einstein, you know theory of relativity. You know, that started on the front page ran in, into the full, almost full page inside. B: Oh. B: Oh. B: Uh-huh. A: Now, these are feature kind of articles. B: Wow. A: All the, all the, uh, you know, the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities. B: Right. A: But, but there is some very good other articles uh, you'll find in the, in the JOURNAL. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Do you find that you're, uh, uh, disappointed or pleased with, uh, uh, the performance of like network coverage of news? A: Uh, I wish it were in more depth. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, that doesn't mean to say longer, A: just more facts would be nice. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, C N N has, has, you know, was, was pretty good during the war. B: Oh, yeah, B: definitely. A: Uh, and they were, you know, sort of had a unique vantage point for, for doing that reporting. B: Uh-huh. A: So, but, you know, it's not, it's never quite, B: All right. B: Uh, exercise huh A: Yeah. B: Uh, as a matter fact, I work out in the mornings. B: I belong to Presidents. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, I have got a routine for every morning of the week B: and I don't work out on Saturday or Sunday A: Uh-huh. B: but, uh, I do, I do a combination of, uh, uh, running and weight training A: They set that up for you. B: No, B: I, uh, actually I just, uh, joined on my own B: and I have been thinking about getting with a, uh, one of their counselors just so see what, uh, they might have to offer as far as, uh, alternatives. A: Uh-huh. B: But, I pretty much, uh, worked on my own routine. A: And, uh, what kind of running do you do? B: They have got the track on the inside. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, I run one mile on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays B: and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I run two miles. A: Uh-huh. B: And then after that, I work out with weights. A: Is is just aerobics A: or, B: Uh, I work out with free weights. A: No, A: uh, I mean the running. B: Oh, uh, yeah. B: It is really the, uh, aerobic work out part. A: You do it, you do a mile in about eight minutes or less? B: Uh, about seven minutes. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Then you wouldn't, then you don't get, uh, out of breath. B: Uh, no B: I do A: Oh. B: Yeah, B: that is, that is a pretty good clip B: and I am pretty winded by the time I get done. A: Oh. B: So, A: But, I mean it's not pushing it real hard, like, you know, if you tried to make six or something like that. B: Oh, yeah. B: I, I, uh, could probably go faster, B: but then I would wear myself out A: Right. B: And I wouldn't be able to work out anything else. A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: How about you? A: Yeah, A: I, I don't run much any more. A: I did when I was in school. B: Uh-huh. A: Right now I just lift, uh, weights and do push ups and sit ups B: Uh-huh. A: and, and I, uh, jump rope a little bit B: Uh-huh. A: and that is about it B: Yeah. A: And I don't, I don't lift any heavy weight, uh, A: they are about a third of my body weight. B: Oh, I see. B: So this, uh, B: do you just try and keep them, I guess, uh, firm and, uh, A: Yeah A: and uh, uh, I play the trumpet A: and the, uh, the more upper body strength, the easier it is to play. B: Yeah, B: uh, that is true. A: You have to do a whole lot of sit ups A: and, uh, and then, uh, I hurt my neck, uh, about three years ago. B: Yeah. A: So, you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from, uh, hurting yourself when you play high. B: Oh, I see. A: You have to, you have to do it correctly, you know, A: it is like an exercise in itself, A: but a lot of people, uh, strain themselves doing it. B: Oh, I see. B: Uh, so you are in, uh, in part of a band? A: Uh, I play at Church. B: Oh, I see, B: I see B: I use to play an instrument when I was in high school, B: but it wasn't the trumpet A: Yeah. B: So, I was just wandering if that was what it was or something. B: I think, A: Uh-huh B: So do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer? A: Well, yeah, A: uh, well the weather is nice except for when it rains, you know I mean in Dallas. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: I keep thinking about it, A: but that doesn't mean it gets done. A: I, I mostly jump rope more. B: Uh-huh. A: You know. B: Yeah, B: I use to do a little bit of jumping rope, uh, when I was, uh, B: well a while back I was more into basketball A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, I could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, but, it has been a while since I have done that. A: Yeah. A: I do a toe lift and squats for that. B: Right. A: But you know it, it doesn't, uh, doesn't, uh, accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a long time. B: Right. A: They tend to tighten up whenever, whenever you have to do something at, uh, uh, great length of time. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I, I, uh, that is true. B: I have noticed that, uh, A: And it also builds too much mass if you just, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: So, it is like, I, I lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, then it doesn't bother me very much. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Huh. That is interesting though. B: Uh, I have been thinking of changing, uh, B: I have done the same routine for almost two years now B: and I am thinking of, uh, changing it up. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, that is why, well, you know, I was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to, uh, get out of the routine. A: Right. B: Because I have heard that, you know, you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing. A: Uh-huh. B: So, I am looking at changing things a little bit. A: Yeah, A: that is, uh, I have started doing more push ups A: and, and it has helped a lot A: and then I add sets to it so that I don't like you said, wear it out. B: Uh-huh. A: I don't try to push it so the end in one set. B: Yeah. A: Okay, A: uh, clothing at work. A: Um, I work as a news reporter, A: and a lot of, B: Oh. A: I work in a, since I work in a small station, A: this is my first job B: Uh-huh. A: and so, I dress very variedly if that's a word. A: Um, sometimes I'm shooting and doing photography, A: and so I'll be in jeans one day, A: and another day I'll be on camera, B: Uh-huh. A: and so I'll be in a suit A: and another day I'll come in A: and I won't know what I'm doing, A: so I'll wear a pant suit in case I have to shoot. B: Yeah, B: uh. B: Oh. A: So, it really varies. A: I try to dress very comfortably. A: I don't really like dressing up at all. B: Oh, me neither A: I don't, I don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that. B: Yeah. A: I just, A: I don't know, A: it just, it takes too much time out of my day, A: and I don't, I don't know B: Yeah, B: same here. B: I don't mind not wearing any makeup A: Yeah, A: I don't mind it at all. Um. B: Um, I work at a bakery because I'm a, still a, a college student. Um. A: Uh-huh. A: Okay. B: But, we, we have to wear white pants and, um, any color T shirt, as long as it's not like a bright color, like a pastel. A: White pants in a bakery. B: Yeah. A: Wow. B: Yeah, B: the bakers wear all white A: Okay. B: And we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back B: and so. A: What's the name of the bakery? A: Oh, Italian I guess. B: Yeah B: it's Italian bakery. B: And, uh, so, I don't mind having, having to wear a uniform, because I don't have to buy, you know right, as you know, many clothes. A: New clothes and stuff. A: Yeah, A: that's one thing I would like, is just to sort of have, I really don't like uniforms but, just to have something I don't have to get up and decide what to wear. B: Oh, yeah. B: Yeah. A: That just bugs me to death. B: I know B: I do that every day for school A: Oh, yeah. B: Yeah, B: but I, I like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things and. A: Sweats and. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: when I was in school, I was a sweat monster. B: Yeah A: All I had was sweats, A: and when it was time to go out, I didn't have anything to wear. B: Yeah, B: I know, B: I don't have very many dress clothes B: but I don't mind, A: Yeah. B: I don't need them yet A: Yeah. B: Um. A: Um, let me see. A: I hate shoes. A: If I didn't have to have shoes, I wouldn't have them. B: Oh, really. A: I just, oh, my feet bother me, A: and they're just tedious B: Oh. A: to go find shoes for me, it's just, A: I don't know. A: I wear size nine B: Oh. A: and it, I don't know if just the shoes I get, I either don't like them or they don't fit right, A: and I just wish that I could just go without them. B: Um. B: Oh, wow, I love shoes. A: Oh, really. B: I always buy shoes A: Oh. B: Yeah. A: Just the opposite. A: But, um, let's see, A: what else do I wear? A: Um, if I were in a bigger market, when I do get into a bigger market, I'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things, and, uh, where I wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things A: and I could then I would be able to dress more business-like and things like that, B: Uh-huh. A: but we're all kind of just out of school at this station, B: Yeah. A: and so we're all, you know, still in sweats, really. B: Oh. A: So, it's pretty fun though. B: I like the look, the, the like suit look, professional like, you know, look, B: but I, I really don't have much of an opportunity to wear it A: Yeah. B: Um I'm going to be a teacher, A: I. B: so I'll probably just wear casual clothes, maybe skirts and some. A: Oh. A: Yeah. A: I like this, the, uh, suits with the, A: they come like with a mini type skirt you know, and the jacket. B: Oh, yeah. A: I like that, A: but but I'm pretty short, B: Yeah, B: that is cute. A: I'm five four, A: and so that really doesn't flatter me, A: but I think it looks good on taller people. B: Yeah. B: I'm five three B: and A: Are you? B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: any time I go to the store, A: I mean, I, I have like two pairs of pants, because I can never find any that are short enough for me B: Oh, really? A: and it's just, oh, ridiculous. A: Pants, too, I could do without those. B: Oh. A: Pants, shoes. B: I like the like stretch pants, the cotton ones. A: Yeah, A: those are nice. B: They're really comfortable. A: Those are nice. B: With a baggy sweatshirt. A: Yeah, A: those are nice. A: And, tennis shoes. A: My boyfriend's got me these L A Gear. A: They're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes. B: Oh, yeah. A: And it, it's just like a chore to pick up my feet. Because I'm used to wearing the little white girl tennis shoes. B: Oh B: Oh, yeah A: The little ones. B: I have a pair of those. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: And I'm used to those. A: They're just sort of, you know, A: like your feet B: Yeah. A: I mean, you don't feel them. A: You put these things on, A: it's, it's, you know, like exercise or something for your feet. A: And I have to wear them because he gets upset if I don't. A: So so, so how do people in Wisconsin dress? B: Oh, yeah B: Warm this time this time, of the year pretty warm. A: Warm. B: Sweaters and. A: I grew up in New York, A: and so I know what warm is. A: Like five pairs of socks and, B: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: sleeping in sweats or long underwear. B: My parents keep the house cold A: Hello. B: Hi. A: Okay, A: I pressed one A: so I guess we're recording now. B: Okay. A: Okay, um. B: Um, as far as spare time, they talked about, B: I don't, I think, B: who has any spare time B: I've got a, a six year old and a, um, B: well, my baby's one today. A: Um. B: Today's his birthday. A: Um. B: And I'm also, I'm expecting, B: and, so, I, I don't know, B: I haven't had much spare time lately B: but, A: Okay, A: well, I've, I have had some because I was working for P I E, A: and they went bankrupt A: so I've got quite a bit of spare time right now. B: Oh, uh-huh. A: And I've been making dolls, cloth dolls. B: Oh, have you? A: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: And, uh, B: You sew the bodies and everything? A: Yeah, A: it's a, they're all cloth. A: It's not, uh, any porcelain at all. B: So, so you just sew everything up, huh? A: Yeah B: Oh. A: and I make the clothes for them. B: Uh-huh. B: What kind A: And. B: do they have yarn hair B: or, A: Um, no, A: you can get the little curly hair at the craft shop. B: Oh, uh-huh. B: Oh. A: I made some of them with that hair A: and then, uh, don't ask me what the other hair I made, A: it looked like, um, it looked, A: well, I made some of them with regular wigs. B: Oh, did you? A: I went to the flea markets and bought, you know, like the wigs for a dollar. B: Oh, uh-huh. A: Then I cut a V shape out of the back of them and then sewed them on. B: Oh, my goodness. B: It sounds like you're creative. A: They looked really cute B: Uh, do you sell them? A: I have sold five of them, so far. B: Oh, have you? A: Uh-huh. A: I just have to get a place where, you know, I can sell them actually. B: Yeah, B: I bet. B: How long does it take you to make one? A: Uh, if I would just work all day long, making the clothes and everything, probably about two and a half days. B: Oh, really? A: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: So. B: Do you enjoy it? A: Yes B: Yeah. A: I really do. B: Uh-huh. A: And, then I also crochet A: and, B: I, I, I can crochet and knit. B: Um, actually, I started an afghan, B: but it's been a whole long time ago probably over a year ago A: Yeah. B: and it's sitting in my closet half done right now, B: but, it's a knitting one. B: And, A: Yeah. A: I tried knitting first, A: but, I don't know, A: I, I didn't like it. B: Oh, didn't you. A: So then I went to crocheting, A: but now I want to learn how to knit again. B: Oh. B: I A: You know. B: Yeah, B: I enjoy knitting. B: I, I kind of like that, B: but I just, like I say, haven't done it for a while. A: Uh-huh. B: And I do like sewing sometimes. B: I, I've made a few of the, you know, just the little valence curtains in my house, and things like that. A: Uh-huh. B: But, it, it's just finding the time for these things that you you enjoy. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: But, A: Yeah, A: I, in fact, I just bought a serger in December. B: oh, I would love one of these. A: Yeah. B: Oh, that's neat. A: I haven't done everything on it yet, you know, A: but just what little bit I have used it for, I really like it. B: Oh, those are wonderful aren't they. A: You know, especially making the seams and things like that you know, it's, it's got such a professional finish on them. B: Oh, yeah, B: that, and that's what I hate doing is the finishing stuff. A: Yeah. B: It'd be nice to have that. A: So I like that. B: Oh, that's neat. A: And. B: Well, do you have, um, uh, B: I guess you're kind of young, B: I was going to say, do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for. A: Well, fifty-seven's not young, A: but no, A: my son's, has been married for almost ten years, A: but they don't have any children. B: Oh, uh-huh. A: So, I just make clothes for my dolls. B: Oh, well. B: Well, how did you get involved in that? A: Just, you know, just like sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll. B: So you did buy a pattern, and then started from there. A: And they, they turned out really cute. A: Yeah, A: you got to have a pattern for the body you know. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, B: have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress? A: Yes. A: Yes. B: Yeah, B: I, I did make some clothes for one of those dress one of those. A: Aren't they cute? B: Yeah, B: I have quite a few of them actually in my house, B: I, and most of them I have bought, um, already clothed, B: but I did I did make the dress on one, A: Uh-huh. B: and I kind of made the pattern up. B: It's not, it's probably not the best B: but A: No, A: I, I bought a bunny pattern one time, A: but when I sewed it up, the face of it looked like a mouse. B: Oh, it did? A: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: See, it was too pointed. B: Oh. A: So I tore it back apart again, A: and I haven't tried another one. B: You haven't sewn it back up, huh? A: No, A: but I bought a little lamb pattern and the material and everything to make it out of, A: but I haven't made it yet. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh, do you do any kind of painting or anything? A: No, A: I don't paint, except I stenciled my wall. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, uh-huh. B: I I tried that, B: I did, I, I ended up just stenciling a, um, a blind, like a, just a roller shade. A: Uh-huh. B: But, I, I can, I had a hard time stenciling. B: For some reason I just couldn't do it. A: Oh, really? B: And people have told me it's very easy. A: Oh, yeah, A: I, my neighbor did it first A: and I seen her house A: and I saw how beautiful it looked, A: so then I decided well, I was going to do it, A: and uh, it turned out really, really good. B: Well. B: What design did you use? A: Uh, mostly flowers you know. B: Oh, uh-huh. B: And, what room? A: I've done it in the all, uh, all my rooms. B: Have you? A: I put it in the bedrooms and the bathroom, A: Where are you, Bob? B: I am in Plano. B: Where are you? A: Oh, okay. A: I am in Waco. B: Is that right? A: Yeah. B: Oh, okay. A: Right down the street. A: Oh, credit cards. A: My favorite subject B: You mean you use credit cards? A: Oh, do I. B: I bet you used them all up over Christmas. A: Yeah, A: mostly over Christmas. A: Uh, I get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle. Where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off B: And then your are in debt. A: and so then you have no money, A: so you use a credit card. B: I understand that. A: Yeah. A: Uh, I probably have one of every credit card there is. A: Do you use them a lot? B: Well, uh, it kind of comes and goes, uh, B: I use uh, Citibank, the, uh, Advantage one pretty much cause you get vantage points for every dollar you spend. A: Uh-huh. B: Once a year, I get a free airplane ride that way. A: Oh. B: So, as long as you pay it off every month, it doesn't cost you anything. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Well, that is a good idea. A: Is that that through a VISA? B: That is what I, B: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: Huh. B: But, uh, I got all sorts of credit cards for my business that I use B: but, uh, If I can get away with paying them off every month, it is alright. A: Uh-huh. B: If I don't then it gets expensive A: Yeah. A: That is my problem. A: I don't try and pay them off. A: I pay, like the minimum. B: Well you shouldn't do that. A: I know A: So I have got myself, B: You never, you never get out of the hole that way. A: Exactly. A: I have got, that is why I have got myself with all this trouble now. A: But, I pay most of them on time and everything. A: It is just the, A: I always have them. A: So, it is kind of strange. B: Kind of like the federal government right? A: Oh, yeah. A: Exactly like the government A: In, In debt. B: Can't never get out of debt. B: And every time you try to get out of debt, the economy goes to pot because people are spending money, right. A: Yeah. A: Have they put the cap on the interest rates? B: No. A: I didn't know if they actually did that or not. A: I know they were considering it. B: Just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent. B: The rest of the, uh, and me, we have got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Funny how that works, isn't it B: The, thou who doesn't need credit, gets cheap credit. A: I would be interested to find out how many people, or how much, uh, people use credit this year. Say in nineteen ninety-two as opposed to nineteen ninety-one, even nineteen ninety. A: I think, I think it would be amazing how much, how many more people use it. B: Well, I think so B: because the, A: Because of the economy. B: That's right. A: Yeah. B: You have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at. A: Exactly. A: I would be very, I would like to see some numbers on that. A: I think that would be interesting. B: Do you, do you have any, uh, credit union where you work or anything like that? A: Yeah, A: I have a credit union. B: Do they have a Mastercard or VISA card? A: Yeah, A: they do. A: Uh-huh. B: You have got that one. A: Yes, A: I do A: Yes, A: I do a matter of fact. B: Who, who do you work for? A: Uh, I work for Channel six. B: Oh. A: It's it's an N B C affiliate down here. B: I do a lot of work down in Waco, B: a lot of, I call on a lot of my business is down there. A: Oh really. A: Oh, okay. A: Where do you work? A: What is your, B: I sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling. A: Oh, okay. B: Tyme and Mercury and Tempco and all those people down there. A: Oh, okay B: Uh Gene A: So you probably work with, uh, uh, A: what is the boy from here? A: You ever work with Davis? B: Davis Iron? A: Davis Iron Work, A: yeah. B: Yeah, B: matter of fact I just saw them last week. A: Oh, okay. A: And, uh, what else. B: Are you in that part, are you in the south part of town now? A: Well, I live actually in Hewett. B: Oh, yeah. B: Okay. A: Yeah, A: right outside. B: You know Do you know Parker Machine Tool down there. A: So, that is where Davis Iron Works is. A: Uh. B: Bobby Parker and, uh, A: I don't think I have seen that one. A: I am sure I pass by it or something, A: but I am not sure. B: There is a place in Hewett, called, B: it is a new company called Prime Air. B: That is in Hewett. Just around the corner from Davis Iron Works. A: Huh. Prime Air. B: They make, uh, humidifiers and uh, filters for air filtration stuff for hospitals, homes, something like that. A: Oh, okay. A: Okay. A: Have you ever been to Marlin? B: Uh, yeah. A: I think it is Marlin or Mart. A: They have, uh, uh, a place, I guess that would be similar to Prime Air. A: It is called H G H or something like K G H or, B: Oh, really. B: Huh. A: I can't think of it. A: I can't think of the name. B: Huh. A: But, B: I will have to stop in there. B: I went, I have gone through there, uh, B: my oldest son goes to A and M. A: Oh yeah. B: He is working on his Master's. B: The Navy sent him there for his Master's. Mostly in engineering. B: So, once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty-five. A: Yeah. B: That is about the last time I have been through Marlin and Mart A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, I don't like that drive. A: I make that drive sometimes A: we have stories out there A: but, uh, B: There is always a state trooper down there. A: Huh. B: You have got to drive careful. A: Oh, really A: I know. B: Between Mart and Marlin, they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour. A: Oh, goodness. A: They, they are bad at Hewett too. On eighty-four. B: Uh-huh. A: They are real bad. A: That is where I got my last ticket. A: So, of course, I couldn't pay that on a credit card. A: Well, I was just wondering if you had had any experience with, um, the care of the elderly. B: Yes, B: I have. B: In fact, uh, just a little over, just a little less than a year ago, uh, my mother went to be with the Lord, B: and we cared for her the last, oh, seventeen months of her life here in the, at home. Aside from, uh, having to, uh, take her to the hospital A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, you know, those times, well, she was there in the, the regular hospital. A: Right. B: And then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer, B: and so the doctor elected to have her, uh, finish out, uh, in the hospice program. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, I, as far as I'm concerned, that is far and above any nursing home, because, uh, she's around her own you know, the, the elderly parent in question is around their own family. B: The, uh, hospice program provides a hospital type bed. Well, it is a hospital bed, and all the oxygen, stuff and a, uh, and a visiting nurse at least every other day, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. A: Well, that's nice. B: And it's all taken care of by, by, uh, Medicare, uh, B: and, uh, it, it's, it's really neat, uh. B: And I, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't banish, uh, my old loved one to a, to a warehouse. A: No. B: And that's, that's what I basically, uh, view a nursing home as, a warehouse, B: so that's, A: It's really sad B: Pardon me? A: It's really a sad situation. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, I think a lot of people struggle with. A: I, I guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever, you know, the parent is, doesn't always want the in-law living in the house. B: Oh . B: Uh-huh. A: Is that right? B: Right. A: Well, that's really sad. B: Yeah, B: I know. B: But, uh, in this case, uh, spouse and I, uh, are, uh, we're, are, are, uh, united in this area because, I guess her father, her grandfather and grandmother both lived with, uh, her parents, uh, their golden years too, A: Uh-huh. B: so this isn't like, uh, uh, just one, one, uh, instance. A: Uh-huh. B: In fact, uh, her, uh, uh, experiences were, were invaluable to me. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, in fact, I don't know if I could have, uh, held up, uh, you know, without my wife, uh, helping in this, this, in this case. A: Right. A: Yes. A: Well, I know when the, I remember being a child A: and my grandmother had had several strokes and things, and that we had, my parents tried to keep her in the house, A: and they did for a long time. I couldn't, tell you how long, until she got, uh, where she had to have complete care, B: Uh-huh. A: and so , they couldn't, you know, keep her in the house anymore, B: Uh-huh. A: and it was really hard on everyone. A: She had to have, you know, twenty-four hour a day care. A: And I don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And that, um, they put her there, A: and we all went just constantly until she died. B: Oh, okay. A: But it was very hard on everyone to see, you know, grandmother be like that, A: and I don't know that, you know, I don't, being so young, I don't remember why. You know, what was, why she had to go there. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, maybe, well, as, as you say, the care of, of grandmother or was, was just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, I do remember that she was, you know, totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way. B: Oh, boy, B: yeah. A: And that that, they couldn't, they found that they could not you know, give her the hygienic care and everything that she needed. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, then, then there's almost, then there's almost no, no, uh, uh, choice left to her then A: No, A: but like you say, there is a tendency for people to be abandoned, though, you know, in the nursing home. B: Uh-huh. A: I do remember the other patients there, uh, being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother, because they got some interaction with someone. B: Right. B: In fact, just, uh, just, uh, sit and chat with them for five minutes and, and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is. A: Uh-huh. A: Right, A: right. A: And I guess that's hard on people to give, give up their lives. A: If they're busy they don't you know. B: Uh-huh A: It's easy to abandon people, because we do have the nursing homes, I guess. B: Right. A: If you can afford them. A: But, anyway. Well, I'm, glad it worked out good for your family. B: And then, then, B: Oh, yeah, B: it did, B: and I was just I just praised the Lord that, that we were able to, uh, have, uh, uh, A: I pushed it. B: Okay. A: So what do you you in your lawn? A: Do you do it yourself A: or do you hire someone to do it? B: Uh, no B: we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time, uh, find that it's really a little more economical, B: and we have, oh, I find that I have the time, B: and I kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas. B: I used to live in Arizona, B: and it was very very frustrating, because I didn't have the watering system B: and it was, it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: But over here we get enough water you know, naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers, B: and so it's a lot more rewarding A: Yeah, A: right. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: so. A: Well, we do our own out here, uh, you know, mow it ourselves and everything, A: but, uh, our water supply right now is bad. A: We need rain badly B: Oh, that's right. A: Uh, we can water, here in Patterson, I can water on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturday and Sunday, four days a week. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: Is that enough during the hotter times of the year? A: It was this last summer, A: yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, now if it, we don't get some rain, they might limit it to not even four times, you know B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: but, uh, yeah, A: we do our our, you know, mowing ourselves and everything, A: and I do our planting of bulbs and things where I can have some spring flowers B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, B: Yeah, B: I find that I've been doing a lot of perennial planting, which I never did before A: Uh-huh. B: and it's been real enjoyable, although I didn't do any this last fall, because our past winters have been so cold, um they'd freeze down, A: Uh-huh. B: and by the time they, the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting A: Oh. B: So I was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and, and spending too much money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding, B: so um, I'm going to try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that, you know, feels. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: We have quite a few roses. A: I just, uh, we, in fact we just pruned them way down, A: and I just had to replace one of them, A: so I just bought that yesterday, A: and I'll probably go outside today and plant that. B: Uh-huh. A: But, um, I like to have the roses where I can have cut flowers all year long. B: Yeah, B: those are enjoyable. A: I even had, uh, roses on my table for Christmas dinner which was really pretty, you know B: Oh, did you? B: Uh-huh A: But, um, other than the roses I don't have too many flowers. A: I plant gladiolas B: Um, those are nice. A: and those are always pretty, A: but they get so tall, A: and they, they bend over so fast you know. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: I haven't done much in, in to Pittsburgh. A: He went to aeronautical, uh, oh, just learning to work on engines and that. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, it has to do with airplanes and everything, which is what his whole life is A: And I really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally. A: And he would probably be flying, is what he would be doing. A: Uh, but, but right now, of course, he's, he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut A: and they build and rebuild non jet engines. B: How about the other four, other three who went? A: Uh, the other ones, uh, the second one, she chose, we let her go where she wanted to, uh, A: we did not want her to go, A: but she went to Erie, to Gannan University. Uh, or Gannan College, A: I am not sure which it is, A: college, I guess. A: Uh, she went there two years A: and it was more expensive A: and she soon realized, you know, A: even though she did not like Clarion, she came back and finished at Clarion. Because, it, uh, saved her quite a bit of money A: and she got really the same basic education that she wanted. B: Uh-huh. A: And our other two boys, they went to Clarion also. And, uh, did very well there. A: And they have all really got, uh, they have all really got really good jobs. A: And, uh, B: When they were, like in junior high and high school, I mean, had they, did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh, yeah, A: they kind of had that, A: they just expected to go. A: Daphne never went, A: she always said she would never go to college. A: She said, I, I always thought she would change her mind, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: but she did not. A: And there's nothing wrong with that, you know, if, A: college is not for everybody. B: Uh. A: But, uh, it, it does make a difference in your wage income. A: I think it's what they want out of life, A: because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are, they can make a, you know, a much better income. B: Uh-huh. A: Like my kids, they are all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state. A: You know, that boggles, my mind. B: Yeah, B: I was, I was making more than, I was making three times what my father was making, as an executive in the insurance industry, when he retired. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Okay, A: did you go to college? B: Yeah, A: You did. A: See it makes a difference. B: I went, uh, four years to undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln, because Lincoln is where, where my parents live. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And there really, there really was not a choice, A: Uh-huh. B: I mean the finances, uh, dictated that you had to go there. A: Uh. Uh-huh. B: I kind of, B: I am not going to say I resent it, A: Uh-huh. B: but I was, well you know, one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and, you know, one of the Rhodes Scholars kids, and the whole bit, uh, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: my parents did not even discuss with me going to college out of state, or anyplace else, A: Some place else. B: and I just knew that the finances, you know, would not support it. A: Uh-huh. B: If I had known how, not, I am not going to say easy, but how much less difficult than I thought it would be to get a, uh, scholarship, to go anyplace else, I think that I would definitely, you know, have gone A: Uh-huh. B: Now when I finished there, then I got a scholarship to go the Harvard University in Boston. A: Uh-huh. B: And that was, uh, I think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened, B: I mean I was, taken out of my element, you know, the homogeny midwest, which is a lovely place to grow up, and put into someplace else where, people thought differently, looked differently, sounded differently, you know, different life style. A: That's great. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Different life styles, A: yes, A: yes. B: And I think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me. A: Uh-huh. B: Now my kids, I keep saying that, uh, you know, I would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could. A: Uh-huh. B: And I do not know, you know, what the realities, you know, is going to look like, you know, B: we are putting money away already. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, but I really think it's important to put these children someplace where, in addition to, you know, them getting an education, they really need a, you know, a socialization away from what they are raised in. Especially if you lived a pretty insular community A: Uh-huh. B: and, An upper class suburb of Dallas, let me tell you, It's very different. A: Right. A: It's quite a bit different. A: See that's the way we are, A: we are more of a rural type of an area A: and it does make a difference. A: I, they say, you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking. B: You should not. A: Yeah, A: not really. A: Because, they say that a lot of times you get more help, with a more expensive college. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, yeah. A: And so, in the long run, if it's really what they want, you know, they are better off. A: Now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, we, we did all we could, A: but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go. A: They suggested some sort of a recipe, uh, for, uh, company, for entertaining. A: Did you have anything in mind that, uh, you'd like to share? B: Well, I, uh, just had a Christmas Around The World party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres. A: Ooh. A: Oh. B: And I fixed, uh, a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy. A: Ooh, that sounds good. A: What, B: It's, uh, it's like, uh, eight ounces of cream cheese softened, A: Uh-huh. B: and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice, one tablespoon worcester sauce and mix it and spread it out onto a plate. B: And, A: One tablespoon of worcester? B: Uh-huh. A: Okay. B: And then you take and, uh, cover that with drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuits crackers. A: Oh, that, B: And that always goes over real well B: and it's real easy. A: How much chili sauce did you say? B: It's one of the small bottles. A: Like eight, B: I don't think, uh, A: Not eight ounces. A: That would be a lot. B: Well, it's about eight ounces. A: Is it? B: It, it, B: uh-huh. A: Okay, A: this would make a lot, right? B: Yeah, B: it would probably make, B: well, it doesn't make quite as much as you think, B: but, yeah, B: spread it out because you keep the cream cheese kind of thin. A: And how much crab meat did you use? B: One tin. Of the flake. A: One, One can of flake. B: Uh-huh. B: And drain it real good. B: Uh-huh. A: Oh, okay. A: Have you ever used the, uh, imitation, yet? B: Yes, B: I have. B: I used it, uh, last Christmastime. B: Uh, what did I put it in? B: I think I just served it by itself. B: There's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff. A: Ooh, that sounds, A: I've tried it A: and then I have it here on hand for about a week A: and then all of a sudden it dawned on me, A: wait, is this totally imitation A: and then I found out, A: I went back to the store A: and they said it is a fish product. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: So, therefore, you really don't have a very long life, you know once you buy it. B: Right. B: Right. A: I thought, so, you know, they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is. B: That's very true. A: You know. B: Very true. B: I had bought a cheesecake, uh, B: and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be re frozen, which I felt was real nice. A: Oh, that's a good idea. B: Yeah. A: Whose was that? B: It, uh, was, uh, Lawry's, I believe, or Lawler's. B: And I got it, B: do you have a Sam's Wholesale Warehouse up there? B: It's real, A: Uh, Sam's, A: right, A: right. B: Yeah, B: okay, B: that's where I picked it up. B: It comes out of Chicago B: and they're very good cheesecakes. A: Oh. A: Oh, that sounds good B: Yeah. A: because that's great. A: That must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant. B: Yes, B: yes. A: Okay, A: I, I've, B: And they have, and they have the little papers between them. A: Right. A: Oh, hey, that sounds, B: And I think they're, what, about nine dollars and something. A: Right. A: And it's something good to have on hand, too. A: It's frozen in the first place, right? B: Yes. B: Yes. B: Yes. A: So, you can, uh, A: it is frozen, isn't it? B: Yes, B: it is frozen. A: And then you can re freeze. B: And I thaw it B: and then you can re freeze it. B: And, A: Hey, that sounds great. B: Uh-huh. A: That B: It was, they're very good, very good. B: And that's the one thing that I hate to make is desserts. A: Oh, do you? A: And that's my favorite. B: Is it? A: And I really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it. B: Oh, I love to eat it, B: but I don't like to make it. B: It takes time B: and you have to rack your brain, B: and, time I don't have anymore A: That's the, that's the thing I hate most about entertaining is thinking of what I'm going to serve. B: Uh-huh. B: It is. A: I, I said I can make it no time. A: It's trying to think, A: and then we just, uh, built a new home A: and I have one of these kitchens that's the center of the house B: Uh-huh. A: and so no matter where they're at, your company can see you cooking. Which is funny. B: That's right. B: And your mess A: This, well, this is what everyone has said. A: They said it's okay for you because you keep a real neat kitchen. A: And I said, yes, A: I decided it looks better in BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS than it does in practicality. B: Yeah A: But, uh, what I have learned in the, uh, ten months we've lived here, is it that when I entertain, I have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with all the, everything through, ready to serve. Because with the open area, you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess, like you said. B: Right. B: Right. B: That's, that's right. A: So you have to have the picturesque kitchen, you know, right out of the magazine. B: Well, I like to have mine all done anyway, because then I want to, I want to party, too. B: I don't want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something A: You're right. B: You know. A: And you know the funny thing is, now that I have a large kitchen with a big island and that, I still have people trying to come, you know, A: they'll come in the kitchen A: and I said, out, A: we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for guests. B: Correct A: You're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen B: Sounds, A: And it, it has worked out. A: But at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining uh, well enough that they know, you know, it's very much at home type situation. B: Right. B: Well, a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples, again, that we've known a long time like you, they, uh, we all bring things B: and it sure makes it a whole lot easier. Anymore. A: Well, we even have a better one. A: Now we decided that we all meet, we have it worked, A: Okay. B: All right, B: well, I'm not a big exerciser, B: but I kind of had to start after I had my baby because I wanted to lose that extra weight. A: Uh-huh. B: And so basically at this point I'm, I'm a real walker. A: I am, too. B: Are you? A: Yes. B: I don't do that, oh, I guess I'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips, you know, and keep their arms up. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't do that. B: I mostly just take a, a walk around the block or with my baby B: or, you know, and I have to do that at least once a day. If it, If it's going to make any effect on, since I have to eat the same as I did before. A: Oh, that's good. B: I can't neglect that because of the baby either. A: And how old is your baby? B: She just, uh, well, she was premature, B: so she's about nine months now, though. B: times goes fast. A: Yes. A: Well, I walk two and a half to three miles every night. B: Oh, that's great. A: My husband and I were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago B: Uh-huh. A: and he lost sixty-two pounds A: and I lost twenty-one. B: Oh, my goodness. A: So we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this exercise walking program A: and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school. B: Uh-huh. A: We have a little path that we do. And, uh, except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: Exactly. A: we try to get out, uh, every, every night. B: Uh-huh. A: And he plays racquetball twice a week, A: but I'm not into that, A: so I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned. B: Well, I think that is just wonderful. B: Now, as far as I'm concerned, I have several other children B: and so, uh, I think at this point to fit it into, to other things, it's kind of a task. A: Yes. B: You know. Uh, it's not to where I'm just so freed up that I, I just go, oh, this is wonderful, B: let's go A: Right A: that's right. A: I know my kids are into sports A: and a lot of times, tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty A: so we will just go out after that. B: Uh-huh. A: So, my kids, luckily, are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk. B: Yeah. B: Now, does your husband usually go with you, then? A: Yes. B: Oh, see, now that's really nice. A: Yes. B: Because mine's at meetings sometimes B: and, and he's not really into it B: so I have to, A: No A: my husband never was either until he lost the weight. B: Uh-huh. A: That was his decision. A: He had arthritis in his hips A: and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise. B: I think that is so wonderful. A: So once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night. A: And our dog has lost a little weight. A: He walks every night, too A: So, he gets excited when he sees us put on our, our shoes, our walking shoes. B: I bet. B: I think that's really, really good. B: And, and, you know, I think this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be a routine. A: Yes. B: It's not, B: like when I first started, it, you know, that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there. A: Making time for it. B: But now if I haven't done it in a day or two or something, I really notice that I haven't done it in a ... A: Yes. B: You know. And I like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me B: and sometimes they don't. B: And when they don't, I, I really notice, you know, how fun it can be when they come. B: So, uh, I like to have somebody come with me. A: I know, A: I do, too. B: Uh, I know most of, enough of the people that if anything ever happened I could go to a home around this block area. A: Right. B: So it, it's not real dangerous, B: but still, I don't like to go alone. A: No. B: So A: I never do either. Even if I have my dog with me. B: Yeah. A: You know, it's nice to have another person there, A: but ... B: Yeah. B: You know, A: Mostly, it's my husband A: and sometimes it's my kids. B: Well, I think that's great. B: I, and, well, sometimes when I, I take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise I, I really think I do. B: I was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I found real quick that wasn't for me. A: Me, too. A: I did the dance step when I lived up in Michigan B: Uh-huh A: and it just wore me out. A: I would leave totally exhausted. A: I never lost any weight, A: and I got to the point I dreaded going in. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: So walking seems to be a good solution for me A: and it doesn't cost anything B: Right B: right. B: And it gives me time to think. B: So I think, not only does it help my body, B: but I think it helps my mind too. A: Yes. B: So I like that. A: That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk without having the kids jump in and ... B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: need something B: and, A: Yep. B: They can wait until you get back home. A: Yep. B: Well, I think that's great B: Well, that's what I do for A: Yep, A: that's all I do, too. B: Okay. A: Okay. A: Okay, A: how's the weather been in Plano? B: Basically about the same as what you've probably had. A: Yeah, A: this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city. B: Uh-huh. A: Well, I don't know about you, A: but I was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks, A: and I'm ready for it to come back. B: Oh, you like the rain, do you? A: Well, not the rain so much as the cool, the other mornings when it was like sixty-five when we woke up and sixty-six, A: and today I know when I got up that the temperature said more like, close, seventy-nine or eighty B: Uh-huh. A: so I'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather. B: Oh, are you? B: I don't care for that as much. A: You don't B: No. A: are you a summer person? B: I'm a summer person A: Are you? B: I like the heat. A: Well, I have a friend who's the same way, A: and anything below sixty, she's just not happy A: but I, I think what I would miss is the change of seasons and all because I know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as, uh, A: my husband's from Nebraska, A: and they have more of the four seasons. B: Yeah, B: and I'm from Utah, B: so, I, I like, the four seasons A: Oh, you're used to that, too. B: I just don't like the cold. A: You don't like the cold. A: Well, I usually like it about sweater weather, A: and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long. B: Uh-huh. A: It goes from hot, A: and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer, A: and then it's cold B: Yeah. A: and I wish it were several months of that. B: The thing, the other thing is the, I don't like the rain either. A: Well, I don't either unless it's like, uh, A: some of my favorite's like a Friday night when it rains A: and you really didn't have anywhere to go, A: and it's sleeping time. A: But if you have to get up and get out in it, I don't like it either B: Well, we have several children that are in sports, B: and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on, on, and on. A: Oh, yeah. A: Well, sure it does. A: That kind of schedule, you really need a lot more sunshine. B: I like it better, I think. A: And also the evenings are going to be getting, uh, darker sooner as it gets cooler. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: But I did a walk last night, A: and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still. A: Sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler. B: The thing about when it gets hot here is, I don't like the humidity, B: that part I don't care about. A: Well, I agree, absolutely, A: and you know, it's all relative, A: because I was from West Texas, A: and it was very dry, A: and so I thought Dallas was awful, A: and I still think so, A: but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week, A: and it was so humid there that your, um, all your windows were were wet every morning. A: They had to get the squeejies and clean them off. B: Oh, really. A: And when we got back to Dallas it seemed really dry because it's kind of like what you're used to. A: But I agree with you, A: the humidity, especially for curly heads like me. B: Oh, is that right? A: Yes. A: I do not like the B: Well another reason, B: well, I guess I can't say that it, I don't like the rain completely. B: We have a little garden that we have B: and and so it really helps our garden, A: Uh-huh. B: and, you know, even, I don't know if that's because plants are just that way B: and they like rain, B: or, it seems they thrive when it rains, B: they just, really, A: Yeah, A: I think so too. A: I know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: but it seems like here, A: I would like it to rain and then be over, and then not rain for a while. A: It seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern, that's all it does. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: So, uh, but I, I am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like, B: Well, A: I guess my, my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six, and then probably seventy-five during the day. B: Well I like seventies I like seventies okay. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: are you, do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds. B: Oh, I don't like nineties. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: You can give me seventies A: Yeah. B: and you can give me eighties A: Yeah, A: keep it there B: and I'm okay. B: But when it gets too hot, then it's, that, I don't like that A: Yeah. B: I stay in the house because it's just, It's just too hot. A: Well, I do, too, A: I do, too A: and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it. A: But then we started thinking, especially in Plano, the weather is so hot in August, that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: Static here. B: That's okay B: Um, I've, I've thought about that, too, B: and, um, when we take our vacations, we, we do take them in August sometimes so that we can be away from here A: Yeah. A: We do too. A: I think a lot of people agree the same. B: It just really gets way, B: when it gets way too hot A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: and we've been here for several years, B: and we've been here years when it's been hundreds B: and, A: Uh-huh, A: now there have been worse summers. A: In fact this morning when they were talking about, uh, Harold Taft, they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall, B: Years, B: uh-huh. A: everybody seems to be, A: you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat, because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're melting, A: and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're, it'll be too cold, A: and they'll say, A: well those are the ones that like the cold weather. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: He, he always did such a good job, I thought. A: Oh, yeah, A: he did, A: he did. A: It was it was really a shame. B: A good weather man, A: He didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did. B: Yeah. B: Anyway, um, I guess it's, A: It's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes B: That's okay, B: they say when you're done you're done, A: Oh, is that right? A: Okay. B: you don't have to wait for them to say cut off your time. A: Oh, good. B: You just say, Have a good day or whatever. A: Well good, A: well, then have a good day. B: You too. A: And I hope you enjoy the weather this week. B: You too. B: What is it about, nursing homes? A: well, about nursing homes, and, and older people. B: Yeah. A: Uh, my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother B: Uh-huh. A: and they're just really close here. A: And his mother has bad health too A: and so I go over sometimes in the day when he's at work A: and I, um, help with her and bathe her and feed her. B: Right. A: And, uh, and I, that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe. A: It's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day. B: Oh, it's very difficult B: I know. A: Uh, she has Alzheimer's and does not remember, uh, a lot if anything. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And so she asks the same questions over and over again. Which is not you know, unrealistic. B: Right. A: Um, and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question. B: Yeah. A: Uh, I, uh, A: some nights his mother calls me and says can your family, A: and just bring the kids in the family A: and just come over and, and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented. B: Yeah, B: how old is she? A: She's ninety-two. B: Uh, my, see my father is ninety-two B: and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing, A: Oh, I think that's wonderful. B: but you know if something would, uh, whenever something happens to one of them then, I don't know what I'll do up there. A: Well, A: Uh-huh. B: I, I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes B: and so, A: Yeah. A: I was just going to say. B: They're in Missouri B: and I could, I, I know, I know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them. Most of them. A: Yeah. A: Um, B: And, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a really don't have a place to go. A: Yes. B: So, A: Uh, I think it's wonderful these, these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily A: but they can go and reside there like little apartments, places in between places. B: Right. A: And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves. A: Um, B: Yeah, B: there's one very close to where my parents are B: but, uh, I think it would be nice B: but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything. A: Yeah, A: yeah B: So, uh, I mean, he's from that old depression era B: and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both, able to do everything for themselves. A: Yeah. B: I would imagine that I'll, uh, if something happens, I'll move one of them or you know, in, in with me. A: Uh-huh. B: So, uh, A: Yeah. B: But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is B: and, but I think you'd have to really, B: they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh on this homes. A: Nursing homes. B: But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a, A: Visit. B: I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot. A: Uh-huh. B: And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them. A: They don't go and see them. A: That's right. B: They never go to see them. A: That's right. B: I've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even, B: maybe, maybe Christmas. A: You know, um, I, I think nursing homes are, are, um, some are good B: Uh-huh. A: I have to say that. B: Right. A: But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children. B: Oh, I do too. A: Um, B: Or if, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so. A: Right, A: right. B: Uh, because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes, uh, regulation in Texas B: so maybe we'll get it improved. A: Uh-huh. B: So. A: I hope so. B: Anyway. A: You know, it's, I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there. B: Right. B: Oh, it's tough I'm sure. A: And then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, I'm sure that it is just, you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast. B: Oh. B: Right, B: that would be devastating I'm sure B: so. A: And, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't, uh, A: it's a very, very hard decision I think. B: It is a tough decision B: and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably. A: Uh-huh. A: I think that's right, B: Yeah. A: and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment. B: Right. A: Now I know a friend of mine who had a father, uh, she brought to her home, uh, to live there, A: but he needed the medical treatment A: and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to, to help him out. B: Uh-huh. A: And that might be a partial solution, or something. B: Right. A: But, um, I personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before I think I'd ever, B: I would hope we could do that, and then go from there. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: Well, anyway, A: Well, I, I think we kind of are along the same lines. B: We've covered a little bit B: and, uh, it's good to hear from you B: and, A: Good to hear from you. B: Have a good, A: Have a lovely day. B: Have a good A: Okay. A: Have you faced, uh, elderly care yet, uh, nursing home care for any of your parents? B: Unfortunately, yes. B: Uh, in fact, tonight I had the dinner with, uh, my three brothers and our wives B: and we were talking, uh, B: we had a review with the nursing home staff. B: My mother's in a nursing home. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, we had a review today B: and a few things we had to do that are part of it that you don't really like, like, uh making decisions on living wills and extended care, that type of thing, A: Yes. B: so, yes, B: I'm very familiar with it B: and it's not something that is, uh, you know, B: I never thought I'd have to go through this kind of experience. B: But I guess we all do. A: I think sooner or later, uh, A: both my mother and my husband's mother, we had to end up putting in nursing homes A: and they were to the point that they only lived, both of them, about six weeks once they got in. B: Oh, really? A: And, uh-huh. A: And it's absolutely, I believe that was one of the hardest things I ever did. In my life. B: Uh-huh. A: I, that, it just, you know, it's absolutely devastating. B: Right. A: What have you found in dealing with the nursing homes? B: Well, they're not, every, all the horror stories you hear about them I think are true. A: Yes B: Uh, we've, you know, we've looked around B: and, my wife has looked at, extensively at all the ones in the area B: And the one she is in now, uh, there's a lot of drawbacks, a lot of things we don't like. B: But, again, it's no different than every one. B: And, you know, the cost of it, the, three thousand dollars a month A: Um, uh-huh. B: when you think about it, for what you're paying a hospital for almost the same, well, even not as much care. A: Yes. A: Yes. B: It's not that expensive, really. A: No, A: uh, there, well, there's a little bit of difference in, in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, theirs both ran, A: oh, I think my mother-in-law's was like fifteen hundred A: and my mother's was two thousand. A: Then, this has been five years ago. A: And, uh uh, one of the things that, you know, I had discovered is that if they knew that I came in there at all different hours, they got much better care than if, B: Uh-huh. A: when I started out with my mother-in-law, because she was in there first, I would go certain hours B: Uh-huh. A: and they knew. A: And if I'd pop in unexpectedly, I discovered, you know, they did a little bit, they did better. B: Oh, really? A: You know, uh-huh. A: And, you know, a couple of times with my mother-in-law, I would catch something not being taken care of. And, you know, would have to rate, B: Uh-huh. A: so I got to where, I knew then when my mother was in that, you know, not to go the same time all the time. Because they would, B: Yeah. A: and when I was looking for the nursing homes, another thing that I learned, uh, A: we had my mother all set to go into one A: and for some reason I just went back, and on my own went around the different floors. B: Uh-huh. A: And, I saw areas that they had not shown me A: and they did not come across as well as, you know, what they had originally shown me, B: Well, I'll be darned. A: so, uh, we did not put her in that one. A: We put her in another one that I, I went a couple of times when they weren't expecting me and saw, and, you know, was much, uh, better pleased with the situation. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: you, you know, this is the whole point. B: You've got, you've got to shop them. A: Yes, A: you do. B: I know my mother's in now, in a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the fact that these people are they're up and around, B: but they're, they're, it's reminds me too much of an asylum type situation. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And it's very, very, A: Does your mother have Alzheimer's? B: She, B: well, who knows. B: They call it, uh, dementia. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, we don't know. B: I, I mean she does not know us anymore A: Uh-huh. B: and whether it's Alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows, A: Uh-huh. B: but it's, basically the same. B: And her health is not that bad. B: Although she has gone down, downhill drastically since this, this last, B: well, she had been in a retirement community B: and somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children. B: Well she, we, we just did not have the capabilities to, to take care of her. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, but she, she has gone down steadily since she has been in, B: and she's been in the nursing home now for, oh, I would say about three months. A: Uh-huh. B: And, A: Did she know that she was going to a nursing home? B: I'm sorry? A: Did she know that she was going to a nursing home? B: She, B: no, B: as far as she knew, she was going to a hospital. And that she could, she could handle a hospital A: Uh-huh. B: and we says, you know, mom, if you, you know, if you get a, you get better, you've got to have the care, the doctor insisted on it, you know, if you get better that you could come out. A: Okay, A: what kind of car are you going to buy next? B: Well, one of the cars I'm thinking about buying next is, uh, a nice, safe, small car, B: but, um, uh, the reason being, is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family, A: Uh-huh. B: and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and so forth, A: Uh-huh. B: and we have another four door car that I drive to work, B: and I think it'd be more economical if I were able to a smaller car and, uh, wouldn't be, wouldn't cost much with gas. A: Uh-huh. A: That's true, A: that's true. B: What, what are you looking at? A: Well, I'm really not looking at anything for a while, A: but you know, when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out, B: Uh-huh. A: and you think, Oh, well, maybe, maybe I would like a new car. B: Oh, yeah A: But I think I'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway. B: Oh, yes, B: oh, yes. A: But, uh. B: Well, the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the A: Right, A: they are. A: I sure do like the looks of that new Mitsubishi Diamante. B: Oh, yes, B: oh, yes. A: That is a pretty car. B: I'm, uh, I really like the looks also of the new Mazda that they have, A: Uh-huh, A: that's pretty, too. B: but um, I, uh, you know, the, the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now. A: Yeah, A: they get pretty expensive. B: Yes, B: they do. A: The last one I bought, I bought a, uh, A: well, it's a, it's a Town Car, A: but it was a demo, returned B: Uh-huh. A: and I got it with like, you know, I think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars less than what the list price was. B: Right. B: Well, you can't go wrong with that kind of opportunity. A: So I was really pleased to find that, A: and I then, I bought it for cheaper, A: I was looking at a Honda Accord, a brand new one B: Yes. A: and I bought this, uh, the, the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what I was going to buy the new Honda Accord. B: Wow. B: Well, you get a much bigger, better comfortable ride. A: And the thing about it is they give you that ten, uh, that hundred thousand mile, five year warranty where it only costs you twenty-five dollars to have anything repaired. B: Yes. B: Well, that's fantastic. B: That's real, real good. A: So, uh, I have really been impressed. A: I said, I probably never be able, to find another one that I can afford, you know. B: No, B: do you, A: But I have loved this car better than anything I've ever driven, because you can go on the road and get there A: and you're not even tired. B: Very comfortable, smooth ride, huh. A: And it gets like twenty-six miles to the gallon on the road. B: Oh, it does? A: It sure does. B: That's, that's unbelievable for that size of car. A: I, they kept telling me that, A: and I thought they're crazy, A: so the week after I got it, well, actually before I signed the papers on it, I took it over to Boozier City B: Yes. A: and it did it. B: Wow. B: That's great. A: But it's, uh, B: That's great. B: That kind of gas mileage, uh, we're, we're kind of hoping for on our van. A: Yeah. A: Well, that's kind of what we've always been told, you know, they'll do, A: and then we hope for it, A: and it never happens B: Uh-huh. A: but it really, it does get good gas mileage. B: Well, that's excellent. A: Most of the time when I don't go anywhere I can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work, you know, and then fill it up, A: so. B: Uh-huh. B: Do you, uh, do, does it, uh, need a lot of repairs? B: Is it a very reliable kind of car? A: I haven't had anything, A: I've taken it in twice for like just really minor things, A: and it cost me the twenty-five dollars. A: The, uh, really something really silly when we first got it, A: we couldn't get the light, A: they have all these lights in the car B: Yes. A: and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat B: Yes. A: and we couldn't get the light to turn off. B: Um. A: And we kept trying, you know, A: and we went out to dinner with some friends, A: and it stayed on all night, you know just shining right down on them, you know B: Oh dear. B: Oh dear A: and we couldn't get it to turn off, A: and the next day my husband goes out there A: and he tries to get it off, A: we turn the knob, you know, in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off B: Uh-huh. A: and we turned everything we could, B: Uh-huh. A: and he took it in, A: and they said, you know, you just have to press the switch. A: He says, I've pressed every switch in that car, A: and I can't get the light off, A: it's broken. B: Yes. A: So they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars, A: and they called and told us though, that all you have to do is turn the off switch, A: and they showed us where the switch was. B: They charged you twenty-five dollars just to tell you that, huh. A: They, they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch. B: Uh-huh, B: oh, so they probably went through the, A: But he hadn't, he hadn't done the right one. B: I see A: And it's right on the arm rest in the back B: Uh-huh. A: and we didn't know it was there. B: Oh, okay. A: And the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car B: And found it right away. A: and so we thought, you know, there, there was, it was broken. B: Uh-huh. A: But we've had just, uh, A: I guess it's been in two times. A: I've had it three years now. B: Yes. A: And, uh, it's been in two, maybe three times. A: But it's just been real minor things. B: Well, I think that, uh, you have an excellent deal then, B: and the, the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair A: That's right. A: Uh-huh. B: and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all, B: so. A: That's right. A: But it's really, it's been an enjoyable car. A: Like I say, I'll probably never be able to have another one, because I think we bought it for about sixteen thousand, you know B: Yes A: and I said, I'll never find another one for that price. B: No, B: not at all. A: And they keep going up, A: so I'll have to enjoy it, A: Okay, A: we're on, uh, recycling B: Yes. A: and, uh, I am not real well informed on exactly what Richardson does. B: Uh-huh. A: I know that we, uh, they ask us to bundle our newspapers, A: and we do that, A: and we recycle our aluminum pop cans and stuff. B: I see. A: But now Plano has quite an elaborate system, don't they? B: Yeah, B: they do. B: Uh, it started out several years ago when they put these, uh, collection sites they, uh, near a WalMart, near a football stadium and the like, A: Uh-huh. B: and they just couldn't believe how many people were going out of their way to fill these things up. B: These huge dumpsters were being filled up in a, in a matter of a week. B: So they knew that there was something going on here. B: So, they started looking into programs, B: and what we have now, B: it, they changed the whole way that they do garbage in Plano. A: Uh-huh. B: Instead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week, they make a collection on Monday for yard waste, B: and the yard waste has to be put in a special bag that's a decomposable paper sack A: Uh-huh. B: it's a pretty good size. B: It's maybe the size of two or three, um, grocery bags. A: Oh. B: And we put that out by the street, B: and they collect those on Monday. B: And then on Wednesday, we put out two containers that they gave us. B: One container's a huge, green, monstrous thing that a, uh, uh, a special truck comes by and hooks onto the side of it and flips the container into the back of the garbage truck. B: So and that's where you put your regular, um, garbage and trash. A: Okay. B: And then also, that same day, you put out a small tub, B: it's maybe two feet high and three feet by two feet wide, B: and you put, just throw in your aluminum and your milk jugs and newspaper, B: and then the. A: Okay, A: and then they they separate it. B: Exactly, B: they have a big truck that has like not ten, maybe five big doors on the side of it, B: and they throw the different stuff in the different doors. A: Oh, that's a neat system. B: Yeah B: it is. B: And apparently it's, you know, it, it went off pretty much without a hitch. B: The trucks, the special five door trucks were a little tough in getting because of something to do with the Persian Gulf war A: Oh, uh-huh. B: that the trucks were being, the engines or something were being shipped over there for something or other. B: But it does work pretty well. A: Well, I know our son and daughter-in-law live in Plano, A: and I know they have commented on the system. A: I don't know that they know that it worked that way, A: but they have the two separate containers and stuff. B: Oh, yes, B: uh-huh. B: I noticed something interesting last time, I guess two Wednesdays ago when they were picking up, B: I happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up the, that tub stuff, B: and the man who was doing the separating, when he was done emptying the tub, he took a little electronic reader device off of his belt B: and he read the bar code that was on the side of the tub. B: So they must be collecting information about who does it, and how often. A: Oh, that is interesting. B: Yeah. A: Because I wonder if that means that if you don't do it B: Uh-huh. A: do you suppose they will come and knock on your door and, B: I, I don't know, B: but I think that's a really interesting question. A: That, that is interesting. A: You know, will you be penalized if you don't. A: Will you, uh. B: Yeah, B: that, that seems farfetched only because it, it, there's no law that says you have to buy a newspaper or pop cans or milk jugs. A: Right, A: right. B: So there, there's, it's possible that there is a person in Plano that doesn't buy any of those three things, and therefore wouldn't have. A: That's true, except that it's hard to imagine, you know, when you have, uh, cans, you know, from the, the market and, uh you know, vegetable cans, and et cetera. B: Right. B: No, B: they won't take vegetable cans. A: Oh, they don't take vegetable cans. B: Just, just the aluminum pop cans. A: This is just their aluminum cans. B: Yeah. A: Well, then yes, A: so they have, A: that's interesting. A: I wonder, uh, uh, B: Yeah, B: what they're doing with that. A: Wouldn't you really like to know? B: I would. B: Someday I'm sure we'll find out. A: I'm sure A: you know, if nothing else call the sanitation department say, okay, A: what are you doing reading you know. B: Uh-huh. B: So tell me your feelings on recycling. B: Is it, do you think this is a good thing, or silly. A: I think it's a very good thing. A: I think that, uh, I think it helps if the city is giving you a nudge to do it because I think there are a lot of people that don't do it, B: Yes. A: and I can't say that my husband and I are real, real conscientious. A: We got started on the aluminum cans because our, uh, grandson was collecting them, uh, to raise money and stuff for an organization he was in. B: Yes. A: So we started collecting them, A: and now he's through, A: so we've just, we've kept on B: Yeah. A: and it's interesting, too, that we have to drive, we drive to Plano at Plano Road to, uh, just inside your city limits, to, you know turn them in to dump them in. B: Dump them off. B: Yeah, B: and that is interesting. A: I'm sure there's bound to be some here in Richardson B: Right. A: but we just haven't really seen them advertised or you know, something. B: Yeah. B: Well, the B: yeah, B: the Plano newspaper each, each day, in fact, has a, a little list of all the recycling centers for all the different things. B: They publish it every single day. A: Well, that's interesting. B: Yeah, B: and phone numbers, and, and that kind of stuff. A: Uh-huh, A: well, I haven't noticed, uh, I haven't noticed Richardson, you know, making that big a, A: Okay A: on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why? B: Well, I guess I stand on, uh, on, probably ten for no, uh, restrictions. B: I, uh, recently just moved to Texas from, uh, South Dakota and Nebraska, B: and I guess in terms of gun control I've always, uh, been raised with the, uh, idea in the Constitution that, uh, citizens had a right to bear arms, B: and I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded, uh, more, uh, of a national defense, uh, than anything else, B: but, uh, on the other hand, too, uh, people then, uh, needed to use firearms for, um, survival in terms of, uh, food A: Yes, A: true. B: and, uh, I was raised, uh, you know, hunting all the time, B: I lived on the farm, and, uh, you know, enjoy hunting B: and I guess I have, uh, some problems with, uh, being restricted to, um, owning a gun for, you know, hunting purposes mainly. A: Right. B: And, um, it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, um, eventually we may not be able to have that right any more. A: Yeah, A: I can, I can understand that. A: I was raised in Oklahoma, A: and of course, being Oklahoman and Texan, uh, A: yeah, A: the hunting and everything, A: and I used to things in my father and my husband having guns and all, A: and I, I did, used to be all in favor of it, A: but it's, all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs. A: Yet I think I would vote a one if I thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun, no crooks, nothing. A: But because I know that's not going to happen, then I have to probably right up there about an eight B: Yeah, B: it, uh, moving to this area, of course it happens everywhere, B: but, uh, I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, uh, in the midwest and then, uh, moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings B: and, uh, there seems like killing for no reason at all, B: and, uh. A: Well, it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was. A: There's always been a certain amount of crime in your, you know, your urban areas, A: and I know we lived in Chicago for seven years, A: and of course it was definitely there. A: So when we first moved here, it wasn't as bad as this. A: It's, you know, it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse. A: I don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the, uh, drug kings that are here and Jamaican drug kings coming in. A: I don't know whether that's it, or street gangs. A: I don't know what the answer is. A: I know that it's scary, A: and yet I hate the government constantly telling me what I can do and what I can't do, A: and that's basically what the gun control would end up being. B: I, I think so, B: and, and there's always the, uh, the, uh, the old, uh, saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll, they'll get one, B: and, uh, and then, uh. A: Well, it's very true. B: Yeah. A: It's not the law abiding citizen that, you know, is, is dangerous with the gun A: It's the ones that are going out and stealing it. B: Yeah. A: And I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them. A: And I think that would almost you know, B: it's, you know, feasible, B: I mean, I know a lot of college kids who have them, you know, who had them, but just depends. A: Well, that, that, that, I guess from the, from the card issuer, uh, that A: since, since it's, it's in, the parent gets it for them, that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible, A: but it's, B: Yeah, B: so basically if you want to take the risk A: Yes, A: it's whether the parent wants to take the risk. B: It's your risk, B: do you trust, your, your son, A: Yeah, A: to, to go run up a big bill A: and, the thing is, there some advantages, if he got off some place and stranded. B: Uh-huh. A: I, I'm, I'm leaning towards doing it for, for a convenience, B: Uh-huh. B: I'd say, you know, have one with, you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something. A: Yeah, A: and the idea that, you know, if he got in trouble, there's some, some ways of getting out, and that he doesn't have to carry cash. A: The, uh, A: I, I like the idea of credit cards that, uh, I don't, I don't, I don't carry cash around, and, and, uh, I don't even carry checks around. A: I let my wife take the checkbook, A: and she writes the checks, A: and I record them. A: So it's, uh, it's, uh, it's, but it's interesting that, uh, the people that can, that can, uh, the amounts of money you can run up on, on credit cards, A: and, uh, I, I had recently had some dealings with a fellow that A: they had run up, he was making, oh, considered a modest salary for an engineer, A: and he had run up, uh, more than a years salary in, in various debts to, A: and he wound up declaring bankruptcy A: but there, A: it, it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty, thirty thousand dollars of, uh, A: well, it was a combination of things he had, B: Uh-huh. A: there were, there were several credit cards, A: and then there were several other businesses, B: The, the extended loan payment for your car. A: Yes, A: yeah. B: Yeah. B: I saw that. A: The interesting thing about that is, is that, uh, that, that they're encouraging you to incur more, incur more debt, A: and, B: Well, it's, it's, it's business, B: and they're making money off that. A: And they make more money if you extend your loan. B: Yeah, B: and, and it's, so it's business, B: so, and you notice that they're, they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old. A: Yes. B: And so they've already shifted the risk. B: If they assume that car, then they just have to sell it themselves, B: and they'll recover the loan, A: And they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely die of service *listen; can't be right transcription A: they're not going to keep on if the car were older. B: Uh-huh. A: The interesting thing about it is is that from a, uh, uh, an economy standpoint or in economics, A: I, I thinks it's, I think it's poor, poor, uh, economics to, to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint, B: Yeah. A: so. It's interesting that, that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible, A: and this year it's ten percent or so. B: Yeah, B: uh. A: It's, uh, it's interesting that, that, uh, they encourage us to do things, B: What, now what's ten percent, we can deduct, A: I think ten percent, A: yes. B: I didn't know that. A: Of your, of your consumer credit. A: Oh, if you had a thousand dollars, that means there's another hundred dollar deduction I've given you. B: I didn't think you could, B: any thing on a loan or, I mean a mortgage I know you can, A: Yeah, A: it's on, uh, yeah. A: Yeah, A: on the, the, A: there's, there's, there's a place for consumer debt A: and then you take ten percent of it, A: on the, B: Oh, I've never itemized yet. A: Oh, okay, B: So maybe that's. Schedule A or, A: It's on schedule, um, Schedule A under, uh, A: well, it's the same place, it's the same place you put, uh, interest. A: But, but see that's what, that's what makes Texas squirrelly laws that you can't, you can't take out a, a second mortgage, like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that, A: and so, uh, it's fully deductible. A: The laws are a little squirrelly, A: but it basically comes down to A: it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, anyway, B: Yeah, B: I try, I, I really do, I just try to stay out of debt, B: and I, and I use my Visa for, for as much as I can, B: and I pay it all off, B: and, A: Sounds like you're, you're very very financially responsible. A: It's, uh, That's, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: there're a lot of people who really run, A: my boss drives quite a ways to work, A: and he's got just enormous debts, A: and he's, A: but, I mean, what do you say, it's like, Shucks, Boss, I'm sure sorry you've got all that debt. A: Well, he's had, had two kids in college and, and this kind of thing, A: and that B: Uh-huh. A: I think that the whole credit card issue, I think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts A: and, but I agree with you B: Yeah. A: I don't, I my debts. A: Well, I did buy a new house last summer. B: Hell, I took a five year note out on my car when I, right when I got out of college, B: and, uh, I'll never do that again. B: I still got a couple of years on it to go, B: and I'm, A: It's, it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car, A: and that, uh, apparently that's been going on for a really long time. A: I didn't do it. A: I, I bought a second hand car when I was, the middle of my senior year. B: Well, you, you think you're starting out well, until you start paying all those bills. Uh, apartment rent, A: Yep. B: and, A: Miscellaneous things like food and other things, B: Yeah. A: these habits you get into, eating A: and, and, uh, it's, it's, it's amazing how it, what you learn. B: Yeah, B: so. A: Well, anything else good to say about credit cards? B: Um A: I might just, B: you know, they're convenient, you know, B: that's probably one big thing about them, B: and, uh, A: You don't have to carry the cash, A: and, and, uh, and it's, it's, it's certainly accepted more places than, the places, you know, A: it's hard to cash a check if you're out of state, A: and, B: Yeah, B: well, I was used to using my credit card, like at Skaggs Alpha Beta in Dallas, and stuff A: Yeah. B: and now I'm out here in Phoenix. A: They don't allow, they don't do B: They, they, B: none of these grocery stores take any credit cards, B: so now I have to carry cash when I go to the grocery store, which is new to me, you know, B: I got to have sixty bucks on me or something. A: Yeah. B: So, uh that was interesting, cause I always, you know, A: Carry all that cash with you. B: you didn't have to worry about carrying that much unless I knew I, A: Well, you know they, they they've started towards a little bit of the debit card, A: have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you, B: Yeah, B: I've heard about them. A: Yeah, A: and I think that's where, B: That's mostly locally, B: the banks will line up with, uh. A: Yeah, A: I've seen a couple, A: although the, A: so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the, the time frame which they get paid, in general, A: that, uh, A: they, A: I've seen checks deposited the very next day, I mean, cleared my account the next day. A: My wife will write a check for groceries A: and, you know, almost, A: well I guess it's the day after, uh, A: technically it's two days, A: but they took that check and scurried it to the bank A: and the bank scurried it back to my account, A: and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float, A: but apparently that's why the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, grocery stores are reluctant to do that, because their volume, that is quite high, A: and they have, uh, A: the costability of the cash flow is a big issue for them. B: Yeah. A: Anyway. A: Well, it's good talking to you. B: All righty. A: Maybe we'll get across, we'll cross paths again. A: Good night. B: All righty. B: Take it easy. A: So what kind of weather have you had in Dallas? B: Well, it's been very windy, A: Really? A: Yeah A: see, I didn't, I don't, A: I thought, uh, I thought, A: I lived in Euless A: and I thought it was pretty normal, A: but anyway, but I guess you're right though it has been real hot, A: because it, um, A: I've had to use the air conditioner in March, B: we've already had to use that, A: my husband usually, B: and we've had like, B: I mean, this is probably typical though, uh, we, B: like tornado weather and tornado warnings, B: and, uh, A: Uh-huh. B: so, uh, you know, I, I forget from year to year. B: I'm getting too old. B: But, the, uh, it, the wind's blowing very hard, A: Yeah. B: but I guess, you know, we're just out of March, and, uh will bring the rain in, uh, April. A: Yeah, A: I know, A: The trees are real pretty right now and everything. A: And, uh, I don't know. A: I know the pollen is real high, B: Yes, B: it is. B: Seems very high. B: It hasn't bothered me, B: but I know that people that have allergies it seems to be pretty high. A: I know. A: It's been bothering me a lot, A: but A: yeah, A: I think, I think the weather overall has been, um, probably like you said, probably a little bit warm A: and, Uh, B: A little bit warm and a little bit blowy, I think. A: Anyway, A: so we basically live in the same area A: so it's real hard to, B: Really hard to make too big of different comparisons, right? A: I know. B: Yeah. A: I just think it's been warm, A: and it's been hot, A: and I liked it, A: and it's beautiful, A: and all the trees are pretty, A: and I wish it would stay like this all the time B: Yes, B: I could stand this all summer. A: So yeah, A: I could too. A: And, uh, gah, I don't think we can say anything else really. B: I don't think we can either, B: let's cut off. A: Yeah, A: that sounds like a good deal. A: Well, you have a nice day. B: You too. A: And we'll talk to you later. B: Bye-bye. A: Bye. A: Okay, um. B: Let's talk about the Middle East situation. A: The U S involvement in there, then I guess even though. B: Now that's it's all over with, you know. A: Well, it is over A: but I don't think we're out of there by any means, A: and uh, I wonder are we going to set up you know peace keeping type forces for long term. A: You know, is that something we should do or shouldn't do? A: I don't know. B: I don't know B: I understand that the U S is talking about leaving more of its planes and things over there. B: Uh, I guess, they, uh, they're anti U S in that region B: and now they're, you know, B: like Syria and Egypt, you know had some pressure against the U S, B: but now they, now they wouldn't allow us to have a base in that region B: but now I think they are rethinking that. A: I think that's true because of all the support that came through. B: That's right. A: The other thing that I think is good for like American businesses are to be involved is the, the reports that I hear back A: and of course on the news I try to listen and also read between the lines you know B: Uh-huh. A: But, they said that because the Americans you know took such a proactive stance involvement in the war that A: like so much of the business and the rebuilding in Kuwait and things like that will go to American businesses where as before they may be dealt with Japanese firms or other people. B: Uh-huh. A: They said even though the Japanese were involved monetarily, uh, they still A: like the first, first priority ought to go to American businesses, which I guess will be good you know which will be good for our economy. B: Right, B: right. A: But, I, you know. B: They get so much of our money from oil anyway A: Boy, A: don't you know, A: I mean we don't seem to slow down even when there is a crisis B: No, B: no. A: But. B: Yeah, B: I think that's a nice gesture, on the Kuwaiti government part to do that, B: and a few people I guess will make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth. A: I imagine. A: Your oil companies, they may see, probably the first big rise in business they have seen in years. B: Right. B: Go over there and rebuild all those. A: Uh-huh. B: I think it's such a shame that the Iraqis had to just go destroy everything. B: I just. A: I do too. B: I mean, what's, what good is that? B: If I can't have it, you can't have it, you know B: that sounds like something a little kid would do. You know. A: Yeah, A: but look at their war, A: that was his whole war A: is, is A: I'm not satisfied with what Iraq has, A: I want what everybody has. B: That's right. A: And, and you're right, A: it's like you see two little pre-school kids fighting over a toy, you know. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: I, I am a little concerned about you know, A: I know they are putting President Bush right now in an awkward position concerning the, The treaty over there right now. B: The, The deal with the uh, supporting the Kurds. A: You know what am I trying to say? A: Well supporting the Kurds A: but, uh, you know the cease-fire, B: Right, B: right, B: the cease-fire. A: I'm trying to say another, because he yeah. You know because he, he wants them to uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease-fire B: Right. B: Right. A: You know if it's an internal thing, I don't think we can walk in and say, Gee, I think you're right, and you're wrong, you know A: we're not the judge and jury. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, but I know that that's causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like, Gee, you told us, to stand up against him, but you're not helping. B: Yeah, B: to help out. B: Yeah. A: So I think he's in a pretty awkward position now A: and I, I think we ought to help, you know. B: Maybe supply some arms or something. A: Yeah, A: supply arms and support them if they need help A: but I don't think we ought to be over there fighting it for them, A: and and, so I think he's done good on that stance. B: Yeah, B: I think Bush handled, has handled this whole situation quite well. B: He stood up to, to the bully and, didn't back down A: Yeah. B: and uh, and uh, Saddam Hussein miscalculated all along, thinking that he wouldn't commit U S lives and, and forces and, and monies to, just to liberate a little country. A: Boy, A: I would say. A: That's right. B: And, uh, then he underestimated his ability to, to wage a war with us. B: I mean, one thing when we all came over there and said, Okay, here we are, get out, and he said, No, I can, I can win a war with you guys. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: And that was a horrible miscalculation. A: I agree, A: you know they'd advertised and said in the news and said he had the fifth largest army. A: Well, he may have A: but you, B: Not any more A: Well not any more A: but, you have to have loyalty, A: you have to have people who believe in your cause. B: Right. A: You know, I know they tried to turn it into a holy war, because to them that is what's honorable. You know, if you die in a holy cause, B: Right. A: but I think they are smart enough, to see there's nothing holy about it. B: Yeah. A: We just want to go in and took it. B: Right. A: You know. B: Saddam Hussein is not a religious person, B: but he uses it. When he sees it to his advantage. A: Sure. A: Sure. B: And, uh, and I think the people were smart enough to realize that, B: and I think they're afraid of him. Is what they are. A: Uh. B: The population is afraid to speak out against him B: and I don't think he's going to be there too much longer. A: Well, I hope that's true. B: Someone is going to assassinate him, you know. A: I would think so, A: I would think that , you know, A: I guess in the back of my mind I think like maybe the Israeli Massad probably has ideas of going in and, huh. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: You know, I thought they, uh, showed a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything, B: Uh-huh. A: but I don't believe for a minute that that means that they don't have ideas and plans of their own B: That's right. A: But I do agree with you, B: Yeah. A: I think President Bush handled it all politically very smart, you know, giving the support of, of the other Arabs and other nations in the world A: and I think, that's how you have to go into something like that. B: Right, B: right. B: I've heard reports that President Bush was staking his future on this, uh, this war and that setting a precedent saying that this League of Nations will always combine against bullies and to stop this kind of stuff in the world. B: Any would be bully would think twice if he knew that, you know, B: there's this United Nations or world government or whatever they keep talking about that the whole world will deal with you. A: And don't you feel? *listen B: And you can't, you just can't do it and get away with it, you know, hoping that you know, A: That's right. B: because it's a world thing B: and the nations will combine against you B: and you can't, you know, you can't just do this. A: And don't you think that long term that's been a big boost for the United Nations. B: Oh, yeah. A: I mean the United Nations been there for years, but all of a sudden. B: Had no, had no teeth. A: Yeah A: there are some teeth behind it A: and the fact that when they have sanctions and we support things like this, it means something. B: Right. A: And I think that's good for the strength of the United Nations. B: People, B: I guess, I feel sorry for just the average, you know, Iraqi, who has had to go through all of this and the suffering. I'm sure with no water, No electricity, no sanitation, A: Yeah. A: And rebuild from nothing. A: Yes. B: must be terrible, living conditions must be terrible. A: Yeah. B: and it's not getting any better, B: the sanctions are still on. A: That's true. B: You know, except for a few medical supplies they are allowing through now and then powdered milk, I guess, for babies and things B: and until they, B: I guess, yesterday they came out with this, these rules I guess or whatever. For a permanent, permanent cease-fire A: Right. A: They supported it. B: and the Kuwaitis said, We don't want to have to repay Israel for all the bombing that we did that was in there, you know. A: That is right, B: But that's only fair. A: Yeah, A: they did ask that they build up Israel and Kuwait. B: Yeah. A: And I think they should have to. B: Yeah. A: They lost B: It's going to be really tough for them to swallow, B: but we don't want a Kuwait there that's also, you know, just has no power at all, B: and that, that you know, B: because Iran still isn't too friendly with them. A: Well, that's true. B: And we don't want, you know, to be stabilized to the point where Iran will say, Now is our chance, you know, to go in and wipe them out B: and, A: Well I don't think Iran is under the same type of madman type leadership, B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: but there's always the possibility, I guess. B: Yeah, B: yeah B: since Khomeini died over there, things have gotten a little more normalized. A: I think so. B: Not quite as radical a stance, more moderates are in power now. A: I think the person who really may be at this time has a hard road to tow is Jordan's King Hussein because he really kind of, really tried to kind of straddle the fence. B: Yeah. B: Put in the middle. A: You know, he wasn't necessarily for Iraq A: but at the same time, he didn't feel like everybody ought to be going against Iraq. B: And yet so many of the citizens are the uh, the Lebanese. Who were hoping this would evolve into a war against Israel. And uh, trying to connect with Israel all that time A: Yeah. A: Right. B: and there really was no connection at all. A: No. B: And, uh, but boy those Lebanese in Jordan, they were saying you know, this whole war is Israel's fault because Israel told the United States to attack Iran B: it was like, it was like you know Israel controls our government. A: I know, A: isn't that amazing the way that they will find their cause A: no matter what situation they see they're going to find their cause whether it truly exists or not. B: Right, B: but one thing I did learn was how deep the the hatred runs toward Israel by a lot of countries. A: I know. B: They just hate, B: I mean, anyway they can, you know, they can see to connect into something and hate it more, B: I mean, they just, B: I understand most of the land is now Israelis, B: they bought, and actually purchased it and then, and then moved in and started a country. A: That's true. A: But, see you are also getting back to the ages old problem of Arab-Israeli conflict, as far as personalties and who is the selected one of God B: Right. A: and theirs tie so much to their religion. B: Yeah, B: right, B: right B: and they both have holy sanctions. A: So, very different things than what we face. A: Okay B: Well, what, what do you is think is the, uh, the main change in? B: What generation are you, B: I'm, I'm thirty years old? A: I'm twenty-nine. B: You're twenty-nine, B: okay, B: so we're, we're both children of the very early sixties. A: Right. A: And, I have, I mean I've seen some change, A: like I know, um, when I was young most mothers pretty much were housewives, and stayed at home with the kids, B: Um, um. B: Uh-huh. A: and to, to me it seems like its almost the opposite now where the, the woman is working and, and they, you know, take the children to child care, B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: or maybe they work part-time or something. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: So, that seems to be a pretty big change. B: Yeah, B: the family structure in general is being really restructured from one income to two incomes which means from one parent to two part-time parents, if you're lucky A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: right. B: Um, I, uh, B: it, it's funny, B: it's both of us then were really just adolescents when, when, B: I think, most of the major changes for adult women were going on, in America. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think, changes are still progressing, B: but it seems to me that the, uh, really the seventies, the early seventies was a period of the most change, A: Uh-huh. B: and, if I had to somewhat abstract about it, it seems to be the major change has been that woman have acquired more choice. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, that's true. A: That's true. B: Uh, I mean, that's sort of the overall, the meta, the meta change as it were. Uh, where that woman really have more of a choice now about what they do. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, course, they find that the choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if it is for your, you know, B: you can share something you really want, which is a wonderful thing, A: Uh-huh. B: but, it does seem B: like an awful lot of my, uh, my adult women friends are anguishing over, over some of, some of these choices. B: Um, A: Right. A: Well, I know, the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because I think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you, you know, you protected the children, and you want to be with the children, B: Uh-huh. A: yet there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think, oh, but, if we both work, we can get a really big house, and we can have two really nice cars, we can take a vacation, we can do this, B: Yes. B: Yes, B: yes. A: and it's kind of almost expected of you anyway. A: People kind of look down on a, on a, you know, the role of a woman as a housewife, A: it's kind of like, oh, well, you know, she didn't go to college, and she's just a housewife. B: Right. B: She just settled for that. B: Yeah. A: Right. A: Right. A: Even though there's probably women with M B A's, maybe even Ph D's, that are staying at home with the children. A: Um, B: Well, I only know, B: I have, B: of my friends who have, have children, uh, B: I only know of one woman who's decided to go that quote, unquote, traditional route. A: Uh-huh. B: And, I have a lot of respect for her, because she made it as a real choice. A: Uh-huh. B: She really knew that she didn't have to do that, B: but she decided that was what she wanted to do in her life. A: Uh-huh. B: and, she wanted that role. B: She's a marvelous parent B: and I, you know, I say all power to her because she's an example to me of someone who really does have the choice. A: Uh-huh. B: I feel that a lot of, uh, women don't, B: all right I said they have the choice B: but they don't necessarily feel that they do because they no longer feel like if they were just to be a parent rather than, uh, you know, a sort of super woman success in the business world as well, they would somehow be perceived as a failure, in their own eyes or in others, A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: and, and then you, and then it's not a choice anymore. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, and frankly, it's the way that men are. B: Uh, men don't have this choice, A: Uh-huh. B: they don't feel this choice. Maybe sort of feel like he isn't that success that he could have been. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Right. B: So, it's, um, A: There's some T V show on now A: and I, I think I've seen it once. A: I don't get to watch much T V, A: but, uh, there's a T V show where the man is the one raising the kids, and the wife is, B: Uh-huh. A: and I, A: maybe they based it on that MISTER MOM movie, A: but, uh, but, uh, there is a T V show out there. B: I didn't happen to see that. A: I guess they're trying to gain more public acceptance of things like that. A: Because I know there are cases of where that happens A: and, B: Oh, yeah. B: I knew, I knew people who did that years ago, A: Uh-huh. B: but they were very apologetic about it B: because you could tell they were used to people saying, What are you doing that for, you know. A: Right. A: It's probably getting more and more accepted today, A: in fact it seems like it's kind of like anything goes now, A: you're not too surprised on much of anything. A: When, you know, the husband's the one at home raising the children, the mother works, B: Yeah. A: that's not real surprising. A: And, B: Yeah. B: I've seen more and more companies that have, uh, parental leave, not just maternity leave. A: Right. B: They can have paternity leave, as well as maternity leave. A: Yeah. A: In fact I'm pretty sure TI has something like that A: because, uh, one of the area supervisors, uh, in my area, as a matter of fact, took off, um, for a couple of weeks, when his wife had their baby. B: Uh-huh. A: Now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby, instead of having a, you know, a, a nurse, or someone come in, or, or something like that, or whatever, mid-wife or whatever they call it that they have for the first couple of weeks. B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: But, I don't know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do have a paternity, A: he put paternity leave up there, A: but it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation days to go be a father for a little while, B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: I don't know. A: But, I'm not real sure how that goes. B: Yeah, B: the other big change I see in, in woman's lives is, um, to remain biological B: they, uh, women because they have choice are having children much later in life. A: Right. B: Uh, I mean, my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, if I'd been a couple of generations ago, they would have had kids running around by then. A: Right. A: Well, people they, in general, are just getting married a lot later. A: I'm still single A: so I'm sure I'll be one of those parents that's, you know, one of those women in her thirties when, when I get around to, to ever getting married and having kids. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: That's, uh, I think, I think that's getting a little more common too. B: Yeah. B: I actually think that I'm, I'm somewhat encouraged by that trend, because after all people live longer lives now, so, it's not like, you know, it's not like you're going to, uh, you know, pass away before your child is an adult, I mean, barring, you know, unforeseen circumstances. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: And, I think, most people make better parents when they are a little bit more mature. A: Yeah. B: I really do. A: I think it also gives a woman a chance, if she does have a job and a career, A: it gives the man and the wife both the chance to both be working and maybe save up some money A: and then it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while they're young, and, be a mother for awhile, B: Uh-huh. A: and then once they've gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work. A: So, she's kind of got that option, if, if they wait till later, they've saved up some money, B: Yeah. A: that it's not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income, or something. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: That's true. B: So, I guess, I, I'm pretty encouraged A: Yeah. B: I really am. B: But, then I'm a product of my generation, B: I don't know, if I had been born a hundred years ago and were looking at this time, I might not like it, B: but it sure seems nice to me. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I mean, I have other things to complain about, B: but in terms of, uh, woman's roles, um, things really seem a lot more flexible. A: Uh-huh. A: I seem to see more women in, uh, in leadership type roles and management positions, in politics, B: Yeah. B: I mean, it's still, it's still a small minority, B: but it's, but it's an improvement. A: Yeah. B: It really is. A: Like the Mayor of Dallas is a woman. B: Oh, really! A: And, I'm sure that twenty years ago that never would have happened, A: but, B: Uh-huh. A: yeah, A: she's, I think, she's in her second term now. A: So, she's, she's, A: yeah, A: this is her second term, A: I think, she's going to, going to, uh, not going to run again after this. B: Uh-huh. A: But, but, uh, we do, and we have several council women that are women, A: but, you just start hearing more and more. B: Yeah. A: In fact, oh, the, the Governor of Texas is a woman, too B: Oh A: We can't forget that one. A: So, B: What's, what's her name? A: Ann Richards. B: No, B: it, B: we don't get much Texas politics out in California, to be honest. A: Yeah. A: She was inaugurated in January, A: so, so, you're starting to see more of that B: Uh-huh. A: and I know when I was younger it was all the Presidents, and still all the Presidents are men, A: but I'm sure that one of these days, well look at Ferraro ran for Vice-President, and I guess one of these days, we'll, we'll eventually have, B: That's right B: although during, during the Presidential debates, there was some really nasty patronizing, stuff toward, A: Uh-huh. B: I don't know if you saw those, B: but, I thought she was treated badly for being a woman, frankly, I really did by, by, uh, the the then vice-presidential candidates, uh, who really, I thought, had a demeaning attitude towards her. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, it was sort of, it was acceptable to say certain types of things to her that she couldn't say back, that kind of thing, which, I, I, I found myself getting quite enraged about. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: But, really, that's a previous generation. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't, B: it's harder to imagine people of our age doing that, and not feeling really stupid. A: Right. A: Right. A: Right A: I agree. A: Well, I think we've, we've gotten our five minutes A: or, B: Well, they've gotten their five minutes worth of us. B: I've enjoyed talking with you. A: It was nice talking to you, too. B: Okay, B: take care. A: You, too. A: Bye, bye. B: Bye, bye. A: Okay. A: Well, how do you feel about, uh, drug testing? B: Um, personally, I don't have a problem with it, uh, B: I think, uh, as far as, uh, protecting fellow employees, protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do, um, it's justified. B: On the other hand, um, I do agree that it's, it's a, it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work. A: Yeah. B: Um, I would never, I would never have a problem with anyone testing me, B: but I can understand why people would object. B: So, I guess, uh, I guess, uh, I'm kind of mixed on it, still at this point. A: Yeah. A: I am too a little bit, A: I mean, I, I don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing, B: Uh-huh. A: and, and, you know, obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth, A: but I don't really like having to do it. A: It, B: That's right. A: And I don't like the idea of it, it's, it's, makes too much of a big brother type of thing. B: That's absolutely right. B: It, it, uh, I guess it all comes down to, uh, you know, a, a definition of, uh, how much out, outside activities affect your work B: and, uh, uh, granted, you know, that, B: any, any kind of drug use on, on company property and whatnot, is, is definitely not acceptable. A: Yeah. B: Uh, uh, I don't think anybody would ever argue that. Or, uh, any, any after affects carrying over into the workday A: Huh-uh. B: but, um, you know, I don't, I'm not particularly concerned with what people do, um, after they leave for the day especially if I don't, if I don't, uh, see any results of it the next day. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: I think so too. A: But, you know, it's one of those things. B: Well, it, it is, it, you know, B: on the other hand you, you've got, uh, you've got the, uh, the possibility of people, oh, B: you've got some people could be arrested for, uh, drug use, drug dealings and things like that, B: and, uh, if their, if their employers name hits the papers and that it's, it's, it's a mark against them, A: Yeah. B: the company and, uh, you know, what kind of people work there, what, uh, A: Plus, I guess, if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time, then the company has lost what they've put into that employee, and their expertise or whatever. B: That's right. B: That's right. B: Right. B: even if it is, you know, a company policy of, uh, immediate termination or whatever, they still have to replace them. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, there's, there's a lot involved there. A: Well, do you think that, um, it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing A: or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule A: or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it? B: I think, I think the regular schedule stuff, um, that when you say everybody get out of it, that's a good point, B: I never really thought of it that way. A: Well, you know, if, if they have time enough they can, stay off of it. B: Yeah, B: if they really can, B: um, I think the the biggest problem I've got is, is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment. A: Yeah. B: Um, as far as the new hires, I, I hired on just early enough that I, I missed it. Um, where the new hires were concerned B: but, uh, not, nobody, no, B: I don't think anybody questions that, um, testing someone as a, as a precondition to being hired B: but, um, for the conditions that, for our employment to change while you're on the job that's, I, I don't know, that, that's where I think that most people get upset. B: It's, uh, you know, it, it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically B: and, uh, It's just, it, it's a really tough question A: Yeah. B: and it, you know, it, B: people have, have really quieted down after everything started B: but I still think there's a lot of, there's a lot of resentment. A: I think so too, uh, A: I know the, the group I was in at the time this all came up they, uh, were quite vocal about it, through electronic mail, A: boy, they just really, you know let them have it from one end to the other, vehemently B: Uh-huh. B: You bet. A: but, uh, it has quieted down, A: but I don't think they probably feel any differently, B: No, B: that's right. A: and some, some of them did quit the company. B: Yeah, B: I, I know of some people who did, uh, B: it was, it was indirectly related, you know, B: they could always come up with other reasons B: but it, it had a lot to do with it. Just the, the whole attitude, B: because it's really, uh, it's just really, B: it, it seems so B: T I, you know, with the, the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have, um, to all of a sudden, uh, search for attitudes and whatnot. A: True. B: You know, there's not a lot of pressure to, to vote the right way or anything else around T I. B: Like there, like there is in some companies or at least, you know, B: from what I've heard, A: Uh-huh. B: but, uh, B: yeah A: Yeah, A: I wouldn't like anything of that nature, you know, B: Uh-huh. B: No, B: I, A: don't tell me what to do, you know. B: Absolutely not, you know, B: it's, it's, it's, you know, B: if you hired me I'll be, you know, B: supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with B: so, uh, you know, let's, let's stick with that original trust, I guess. A: Yeah. B: But, uh, it's, it's still, it, it still remains a tough question B: and, it's, there's a lot of, you know, the whole, the whole department of defense, uh, reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot. B: There's a lot of different things that, uh, come into play B: but that was, B: I think everybody, everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company. A: Yeah. A: Well, I guess too if I thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem, then that would be one thing. But I think it's too minor and too, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: in, in the whole scope of things this isn't going to, to have any real affect on, what's going on in the street. B: I really don't think so. B: Yeah. B: I really don't because, some people are going to, are, are going to risk it, um, B: it may prevent, B: I, I guess, I guess what I'm trying to get at is, if it, if it, if it does help a few individuals maybe, maybe it's worth it. A: Yeah. B: Um, you know, it may prevent somebody who was, was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot B: but, uh, I don't know if, you know, the, B: it's, it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation B: I don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much. B: There, there's still a big question in my mind B: that, the, the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of, of mistakes on the testing, is something that still bothers me. A: Well, yes. B: It, it's, A: That, A: yes. A: I, I think that could be a big problem, you know, A: I would just be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't, B: Uh-huh. A: you know, that just really rubbed me the wrong way. B: Uh-huh. B: Absolutely. B: And that, B: I, I don't know if, uh, I don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too. even if you, you know, if you take, uh, a, a drug that was prescribed for you B: but the, the prescription has run out you still had some left B: and you happen to take an extra penicillin, B: well, penicillin's not on the list B: but, you know, A: Yeah. B: yeah, B: I, I think you understand what I'm getting at, A: Yeah. B: it, it can still show up B: and it can still flag as a positive B: and, and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent, A: Right. A: No. B: and, uh, those are the kinds of things that still can show up. A: I guess the one that really got me too was that, uh, A: let's say your spouse is on a particular drug A: and you know what that is, B: Uh-huh. A: and then you end up with the same problem A: and you take their leftover medicine, A: that's not allowed. B: That's right. A: You know, that's, that's totally out. B: That's right. B: I even had friends when I was going to college who were in, uh, pharmacy school B: and they could legally, um, provide medicine to their family family members and friends B: certain medicines were, were legal now B: I, I, I believe, you know, any of the, any of the ones we would, we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists, A: Uh-huh. B: but, uh, um, there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications B: and, that can happen. A: Oh, that's interesting. B: But, uh, A: Well, I guess we've exhausted that one. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: I think so A: enjoyed talking to you. B: You too. A: Good-bye. B: Good-bye. A: Well, what's your views on it? B: I think it's, uh, a good idea. B: Um, I grew up, uh, B: my teenage years were spent during the sixties, B: graduating, uh, high school in sixty-eight. Um, I remember when the Peace Corps movement first came about, B: and I thought it was a very good idea at the time. B: I was one of those, uh, Kennedy children, if you know what I mean. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, right now I see a lot of kids who get out of school, have no idea what they want to do. A: Yeah. B: And there's a lot of things out there that we could do, uh, for our own country, A: Sure. B: let alone other countries, A: Sure. B: and I think that we've got the, the people power to do it, B: it's just, uh, B: we need to channel it and focus it on some things that, that need some fixing up. B: Um, some examples are this, uh, some of the things, like Jimmy Carter's been involved in, uh, a little program to, you know, fix up housing for people. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: And there's a lot of housing, A: Yeah. B: I know in the area that I live in, that's run down and beat up, B: but it could be fixed up and used, A: Uh-huh. B: and it's just, you know, sitting there wasting away. A: Yeah, A: we're not too far behind A: I graduated in seventy-one, A: so I'm, I'm same generation. A: I, I'm, A: it's going to be a short conversation because I agree with you. A: I, I think, uh, I don't, I don't even think it ought to be, uh, voluntary, A: I think it ought to be mandatory. Uh, for kids to either, either do military service, or public service, one of the two. A: Uh, a lot of reasons for that, not, not just because I'm a, I'm a hard ass or anything. B: Uh-huh. A: It's just that, like you say, kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do, A: and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus. A: And, I think that it might stop us some problems later on. A: I mean, you know these kids will get their, their heads on straight, and, and figure out what they want to do, instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something. A: Uh, it's, I think it would be good for them, uh, A: it helps mature them a little bit, and helps them understand the world, the way it really is. B: Yeah, B: I think a lot of people grow up with, uh, with, uh, preconceived notions what the world's about. A: Oh, yeah. B: A lot of it has to do from too much T V, A: Oh, yeah, A: yeah. B: and, uh, you know, it's, there's, there's a heck of a lot of difference between, you know, the intake that you get from T V and, and movies, and what you hear in school, and then what reality is. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I remember, uh, I've, I've worked since I was, B: well, I started delivering papers when I was ten, B: and I had a real job when I was thirteen, B: so I've, you know, worked most of my life. B: But I remember when I got out of high school, all through high school was, B: boy, I can't wait to get out of high school, B: I can't wait to get out of high school. B: And I wanted to go to college, B: and I had the grades to go to college, B: and I got accepted to college, B: but when I got out of high school, I kind of said, you know, what am I going to do now? A: Uh-huh. B: You know, it's B: like, you know, when I actually started working full time, and I, I got married shortly after getting out of high school. B: I, uh, thought I was smart, ran away and got married, B: and, uh, I remember there was a time, and within the first year of marriage, I said, boy wouldn't I give to get, be back in school, and just have to do homework, and, and go work my part time job. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Because, life, and the reality of working for a living, and trying to make ends meet, is just so overwhelming to someone, if they aren't prepared for it. A: Yeah. A: And, and most of them aren't. B: That's true. A: I mean, you look, you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right I mean, even in high school, A: and, you know, you wonder, where are the parents in all of this. A: You know, why isn't somebody stepping in and, and putting a stop to this. A: Kids in high school are just too young to be married. B: Yeah. A: They they have no idea what the world is like. A: They don't how tough it is out there to make a living. B: Yeah, B: a, A: Uh, I mean, I was in the same boat when I left high school. A: I, my parents wanted me to go straight to college A: and I didn't. A: You know, I was ready, A: I was ready, A: I had wanderlust, A: I wanted to get out and see some things. A: So, I joined the Air Force and ended up staying there for thirteen years. B: Um. A: Um, but, I had lived in my own little bubble up until that time, A: and, and after traveling around the world a few times, I realized that, things ain't the way they seem. B: Yeah. A: And I, I did a lot of growing up there, uh, B: Yeah, B: I think once, once kids get out and see how other people really live, and know how bad off some people really are, and how good they've got it, and what it takes to have that good life, if you're willing to work for it, then they're probably be more inclined to work for it. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: That's right A: That's right. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, you know, it's just like you say, there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country, A: and, uh, you know, if, if you could have a thought of something like, uh, like a, uh, uh, a Peace Corps sort of organization. I mean, this would be so useful, just in, uh, for instance, just helping old folks. B: Uh-huh, B: exactly. A: You know, they, you know they need help, A: they don't have anybody to depend on, A: and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house, or do minor repairs, or something like that. B: You know, I've, I've I, B: my, my parents are in their late sixties now, B: and, um, so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore. A: Yeah. B: And, it's, it's really hard on them, B: and the, you know, the thought that I, I see the, uh, the mall rats, you know, walking around the mall, nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long, when they could be doing something to help someone. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, you know, there's a, uh, a nice warm feeling, B: I remember getting out of doing things like that when I was younger, A: Yeah. B: I mean, I was a Boy Scout B: and the whole bit and, A: Yeah, A: my mom's in the same position, late sixties, A: and, and it got to the, got to the point where, I mean, me and my brother both were, were gone, and she couldn't maintain the house, without large expenditures of money. B: Yeah. A: You know, it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment. A: And, uh, I, I'm not, I'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway, A: but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things. You know, like the, like the yard work and little repairs, and painting and stuff like that. B: Yeah. B: I think there'd, there'd be a, you know, a, uh, economic benefit for, you know, everyone concerned, those doing the work, and those receiving the, the, uh, the services. A: Oh yeah, A: sure. A: Sure, A: I mean, I mean, the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money. B: Yeah. A: You know, that, A: I, I remember when I was a kid, I used to do little, little things for the old folks around the neighborhood, A: and, uh, I know how it made me feel. A: You know, you uh, A: people just don't help people anymore. A: They're, they're out for themselves A: and, B: Yeah. B: I think, uh, President Bush covered that in his, uh, State of the Union Address this year when he said that, you know, it's time for, you know, the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything. A: Yeah, A: well that's, that's the, that's the point we've gotten to, you know. A: Every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government. A: And, the government's going to be limited. A: I, where are they going to get the money? A: They're going to get it from us. A: And we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government. B: Yeah. A: We don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program. B: Exactly. A: Um, the thing that Carter works on, uh, Habitats For Humanity, I was involved in that uh, in Montgomery, before I came up to North Carolina, B: Uh-huh A: and, uh, it was, it was a pretty neat little program. A: We'd just go out, A: and they would buy a plot of land, and contractors and builders, A: and everybody else would donate their, their time, A: and, uh, the materials were at cost. A: And we'd put up houses. A: And, that was kind, that was kind of neat. A: I, uh, in a way, I think it's a little bit inefficient, A: but, but it's better than nothing. B: Yeah. A: And, and at least I had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing. A: Um, course, on the other hand, I can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves, but just won't. Because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and also. A: I think so, hope so, B: It's been changing, B: it's been evolving, B: but there's still a, an, an inequality in the work forces or jobs. A: Absolutely. B: It's, you know, A: You know, I've, B: And you hear some people say, you know, B: well, he's a man, B: he, he, he needs that salary. A: Right A: Yeah, A: they forget. A: Also, I think, uh, a good argument for that is in the area of politics, you know, A: if a, A: a woman Congressman I'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as, and the same as a senator or whatever. B: Right. A: So, they certainly, uh, they certainly deserve it all the way. A: But, I guess just the most significant thing changed for me, again, as I mentioned, was just in traveling, A: you see, uh, more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases and, uh, and in their business suits and and going. B: And going, B: yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: And I expect you're right in regards to having two parents now. A: That's a good, a good statement. A: And I think if, A: in the future it's even going to be, uh, more noticeable and more significant. B: Right. B: Yeah, B: I, I think it will be. B: I think, I, well, B: another thing I read, too, the other day, B: this is not just for working women B: but how much they're out there, I guess is B: the car designers, uh, are starting to design cars with women in mind. Uh, because in the past the male bought the cars, B: but now they're showing that fifty-five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases. And that they are looking for, uh, different things in the car. A: Wow. B: The man is looking for the in the engine B: and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel. Uh, can her makeup come off the upholstery A: You bet. A: Good point. B: And if they're out there buying that many cars, then there's that many out that are self sufficient and, you know, mobile and working. A: Right now I'm self employed A: and, and my wife's always worked. A: She's a schoolteacher, A: but for, A: she started working A: and then when I first started my business, uh, A: she was selling real estate at the time A: and hers was the only income we had for three or four months A: so, B: Right. A: You know, she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my business A: and she still works everyday A: so, B: Yeah, B: we all do. A: You bet. B: I just happen to be off today. A: Uh-oh. B: I work, too. A: enjoying it A: What kind of work do you do? B: I'm a nurse. A: Well, good. B: And I work at Medical Treatment Center, uh, which is at uh, Jupiter and Arapaho. A: Right A: Married? B: No. A: Yeah. A: Well, trying to think what else I can say in regards to this subject. B: I don't know, B: I'm kind of out of, out of things. A: You see the old, uh, cigarette ads, you know, about you've come a long way. B: You've come a long way baby? A: Baby, A: right, A: and, uh, B: Right. A: You think about this when you come to, when it comes to a subject like that A: and it's really true. A: Women have come a long way A: and, you know, A: do you have a P C? B: Yes, B: I have a Macintosh S E thirty. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: a lot of my friends are into Macintoshes. A: I have a, um, P C, a I B M P C myself. B: Uh-huh. A: A two eighty-six. A: I'm probably eventually going to get a three eighty-six. Um. B: What do you use yours for mostly? A: Um, mostly, um, word processing applications and, uh, just as a dumb terminal. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, but I, um, I think eventually I'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that. A: Um, what do you find that you use yours mostly for? B: Well, I do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base, B: and, uh, about the only thing B: I am, uh, I'm just starting to get into, uh, a little bit more communications now. B: I've just today ordered a fax modem B: so I'll be able to send and receive faxes right over there without using, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: you don't have to make a hard copy that way. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, are you using windows? A: No, A: I, I think I, I'm planning on like moving up, getting a three eighty-six before I move up to windows although, you know, I do like the, the graphical user environment. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh A: Yeah, A: it's, um, A: I want, I want to be able I just want it more for multi tasking, which I suppose is also like a Macintosh. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh. B: Well, the one thing I used to use a, uh, B: I've never used an I B M actually. B: I used to use a, just an Apple two E, which of course is looks pretty primitive now. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: that's what I learned a lot of languages on, was an Apple two E in my high school. B: But I don't have any, uh, any real programming capabilities on my, uh, Mac right now. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't have, uh, any compilers A: Uh-huh. B: so I'm, uh. A: Well, do you use your computer for, um, just things around the house, or in the . B: I use it in my business. A: Well, see, what do you do? B: I, uh, do, uh, consultation and, and testing of various kinds for, uh, English as a second language programs. A: Oh, wow. A: Um, and, uh, are these like, uh, do these programs, um, A: are, are they based on, on a, on a, um, other language, A: or are they based, are they based A: like a lot of the, um, you know, a lot of the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of, you know, parts of the world, A: and the teacher just tries to, tries to teach English, you know, through natural understanding. B: That's, uh, exactly what, yeah, that's the kind of thing I'm working with exactly. A: Uh-huh. B: You seem to be, uh, better informed than the average person on that. A: Well, it was just, uh, when I was high school, I worked for the community school, A: and they had a English second language class A: and it always seemed strange to me that, you know, all these, all these people that, you know, spoke English not too well, and spoke, you know, a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time. B: Uh-huh. A: I imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to, you know, you don't have as many cues, A: you can't, don't have hand gestures and things like that. B: Right. B: Well, now, we, uh, B: what I use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed, though. A: Uh-huh. B: Most of the stuff that I do is not, uh, interactive A: Uh-huh. B: and I use it for uh, data analysis on testing, B: so. A: Uh, to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that. B: Well, just, actually, just, uh, item analysis, statistical analysis of the tests, uh. A: Uh-huh. B: You know, when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort. B: So it's, involves a lot of spreadsheet use. A: Yeah, A: I would imagine so. A: Um, so, um, what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E? B: Well, I was doing some of the same stuff, but doing it more slowly and with smaller files. B: I can't believe, you know, I've got, uh, five, uh, megabytes on this one now A: Uh-huh. A: It, it's . B: and on my two E I had a hundred twenty-eight K A: Yes, A: it's amazing, you know, how, how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much. A: I remember my first computer was a T R S eighty with four K on it B: Yeah. A: and you know, then, then we, then I started playing with Apples, you know, A: and those had forty-eight, A: or, you know, if they were really great they had sixty-four K. B: Oh, the old the old Apple, uh, the, the original Apple had, what, yeah, forty-eight I guess, didn't it. A: Uh, I know, I know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them, is all, A: and B: My goodness. A: there's, I remember that there was one game that I played that required forty-eight K A: and there was only one computer that had forty-eight K on it at the time. B: Uh-huh A: And you know it's just so amazing that generally, you know, if you, if you, A: I'm not sure about Macintoshes, A: but I know I B M you, you generally, you know, you buy a megabyte at a time. B: Uh-huh. A: You know, that's, that's your that's the low end. Uh. B: Well the S P thirty goes up to eight A: Uh-huh. B: but I haven't upgraded it quite that far yet. B: I think probably when I get system seven I may have to do that and, and get another, possibly another hard disk. B: I don't know. B: They say that system seven uses a lot of memory. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I imagine . A: Okay, Bill, A: right? B: Yes. A: Okay, Bill, A: have you done much camping? B: Uh, yes. B: I'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts. A: Uh-huh. B: And I camp, uh, every month, uh, camp at least one weekend B: and during the summer we camp, uh, two or three weeks a year A: Oh, well, that, that sounds good. B: I'd say I camp quite a bit. A: Yeah, A: you do. A: Um, now do you have a lot mountains, A: well, you don't have mountains in Texas, do you. A: Where do you find places to camp? B: Well, uh, we, we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping A: Oh. B: and we, uh, we also, uh, carry all our equipment with us A: Uh-huh. B: and so we canoe down the river and then, sleep on the river on one of the, um, sand bars and then get up the next morning, cook our breakfast, and go down the river again. A: Oh. A: Oh, my word. A: Well that sounds adventuresome B: How about yourself? A: Well, um, I've done, oh, I would say quite a bit of camping, mostly with my husband and I. A: Um, we have five children, A: and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves. A: So we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out, A: and we have gone up into the mountains and, uh, not necessarily roughed it, A: but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains. B: Well, that's good. A: And, then the boys are, our boys are old enough now, A: they're twelve and eleven, A: and so, they're involved in the scouting A: and they do a lot of camping with the scouts B: Uh-huh. A: and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week, A: and so this year they'll both be going, A: and so that's been real enjoyable for them. B: Great. A: So. B: What, uh, what kind of camping do they like best? B: Do they like it where they have tents B: and, uh, do they cook on stoves? A: Um, yes, A: they've, well, A: no, A: actually they've, I remember, they have taken the, the the heavy cast iron dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire, A: and I don't think they've taken the stoves. A: Um, last year they camped in tents, A: and this year I believe they will be in tents also. B: Uh-huh. B: Course I imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. B: It doesn't get very cold in Texas, B: so lots of times we don't even take tents. A: Oh, is that right? B: We just use trail tarps. A: Oh, and what does that consist of? B: Uh, it's just a piece of material that has, uh, that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent uh, like a, uh, A: Oh. A: Uh-huh. B: they're very light weight B: and we use them when we go backpacking. B: So we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles, then, uh, B: they're not very heavy, see A: Uh-huh. B: so you carry them with you, B: and they'll keep you dry or whatever. A: Oh. A: Yes, A: well, see, when, when we go camping here, A: we have to take our big huge, heavy sleeping bags, and lots of tents A: and, I like to sleep on the air matresses. A: I'm not, A: my bones are getting so old, A: so I like to, I like to sleep on the matresses. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, so, have you had any adventures on your camping trips, with, encounters with wild animals or anything like that? B: yes, B: in fact, uh, um, last month we went camping, B: we saw a lot of deer uh, in the morning and the afternoon just deer everywhere. A: Oh. A: My word. A: Gee. B: Uh-huh, B: so, uh, but, it, even though, uh, it wasn't hunting season, B: and we were with Boy Scouts, B: so of course we don't, uh, want to go hunting. A: Uh-huh. B: But we got to see a lot of deer um, out and about A: Oh. B: and there's, B: of course, we see smaller animals all the time, B: and, uh, one thing that is a big concern in the evening, at night, uh, is, uh, make sure that all the food's put away and so forth because, uh, we have, uh, armadillos. A: Oh. B: Do you know what armadillo is? A: Oh. A: Uh, they're covered like with a heavy armor type stuff, B: Uh-huh. A: uh-huh. B: And possums, and, uh, raccoons. A: My word. B: And we have those creatures down here that they like to, uh, they like to go hunting for a midnight snack. A: Uh-huh B: And so that, that, uh, that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away. A: But they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything. B: They will if you attack them. A: Oh. B: But most time they run away from you if they, if they see you're up, you know A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep. A: Oh, my word B: So. A: Well, that sounds a little less fierce than bears. A: We, we want to, A: music do you like? B: Uh, lots of different kinds I guess. B: Uh, I like country music, of course A: Uh-huh. B: Texas B: and I listen to Christian music a lot because there's a Christian music station here in in our city. B: So I listen to it quite a bit. A: Uh-huh. B: So, A: I am more into rock and roll myself. B: Uh-huh. B: And I listen cause on Friday nights they have the, uh, they have what they call Saturday Night Alive B: or they have on Saturday night, Friday night and Saturday night and they have Christian rock and roll. A: Uh-huh. B: So B: you know, they have that type of music, B: but they just have different words B: so, I listen to that too. A: Do you like any bluegrass? B: Uh, no. B: Not really, B: huh-uh. A: Oh. B: And I like I like rap music. A: Well, at least your, B: Do you like rap music? A: Not really B: Not really B: Well, I can tell we're, we're together here A: Yeah. B: Okay. Uh. A: Um. A: Uh, we'll have to, uh B: What kind of A: I have a lot of friends that like country music B: What kind of rock music do you listen to? B: Do you listen to like that really heavy metal stuff B: or, A: No, A: I'm more into, uh, older rock, like the psychedelic era, like, uh B: Seventies and like that stuff. A: late sixties, seventies, uh B: Uh-huh. A: Greatful Dead, Crosby, Stills and Nash. B: Yeah, B: I have friends that like that. A: What B: Yeah B: So you have never heard of like the Christian music that I listen to probably. A: Oh, I've heard a little bit of it. A: I've just, B: Like have you heard of, uh, of Carmen? B: Have you ever heard of Kim? A: Uh, now I've heard of Striper. A: So the only one I can B: Striper, B: they're the really heavy, yeah like the heavy metal stuff I guess. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh, the first of Amy Grant before B: Yeah. A: was, you know, became more mainstream, top forty. B: Yeah. B: Cause she, she plays both secular and Christian B: so, A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I like her too. A: Uh, B: I have been to a concert a couple of times of hers. A: I've never actually seen her in concert. A: I imagine that she puts on a pretty good show. B: She does. A: Uh-huh. B: She's real good. She's real good. B: So, I like her. A: Uh-huh Uh, A: I like some country music. A: It's just that I like finding a lot of it's, B: I don't like the country music that's like my wife left me, my dog left me, everybody's left me. A: Yeah A: Mama got run over by the train. B: Yeah. B: I don't like that. A: Uh-huh. B: You know, I like Randy Travis A: Uh-huh. B: you know, I like more of the real new ones, you know. A: Like Garth Brooks. B: Garth Brooks, oh B: yes, B: you know he's fine. A: Reba MacIntyre. B: Yeah. B: I like them. B: I don't care for the older, you know, like the dog left me stuff. A: You don't like Patsy Cline? B: Huh? A: You don't like Patsy Cline. B: No, B: huh-uh. B: I don't even really know who she is, you know B: You know, so. But, have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like? B: That music that you like to. A: Uh, yeah A: actually I just went to see the Greatful Dead about, I guess about a week ago. B: But aren't they done with? B: I thought that they A: No, A: they're they are still on tour. A: They have been touring, since the late sixties B: And I just thought that they done broke up and left. A: No. A: They're still together. A: They're still making albums. B: Huh. B: Wow, B: I didn't know that. A: Uh-huh. B: Huh. A: Uh, B: That's interesting. A: In fact, I mean there are people you know that basically just follow them around, from city to city on tour selling tie dye and things like that. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, B: Cause they are on up there in age, aren't they? A: Yeah, A: they're, they're like late forties, early fifties, A: but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement B: Okay. B: Alright. A: You know, they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players. A: They keep on dying A: and they keep on replacing them A: and the new one's in this thirties you know. Uh, B: Oh, alright. A: But, uh, B: Cause they look pretty rough. B: I mean, I've seen like picture of them B: and they just, A: Yeah. A: Well, they don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones. A: They just, A: I don't know if you saw the tour posters of the Rolling Stones when they last toured, A: but it looked like leather day at the geriatric, B: Yeah, B: I mean cause they just, A: All their faces were just all shriveled, B: Uh-huh. B: Yuck looking, I mean A: Uh-huh. B: uh. A: I mean it just just looked like they, got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans. B: Uh-huh. B: Well are you into that that rock music, you know, all that druggy stuff and all that I mean? A: Well, uh B: You know what I am saying B: like, I mean like they come on the stage B: and like, you know, you, B: they don't even know they are there. You know. B: They are just so out of it. A: Actually, I prefer my, my performers to be pretty sober, you know, just uh, just so that, you know, that if they're jamming, you know, that they don't just lose themselves and you know, go into lala land. B: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: So, I just don't, I just don't like you know. A: Uh-huh. B: That. B: So, I don't know A: So, uh, have you seen any concerts lately? B: Um. Uh, A: Uh, so, do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time? B: Generally, I don't think they are. B: Uh, my, my personal opinion is that, uh, the politicians are out for their own good because they, they're entrenched. A: Uh-huh. B: They don't ever have to go out and get a real job. B: They just stay in their current job, A: Uh-huh. B: you know what I mean? A: I agree, uh, with, with both of those things, A: but, uh, do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest? B: I think by putting term limitations on you could, you could slow down some of the problems. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, but it has to be not just at the national level but at the, you know, the state and the local level, too. B: I know some senators, B: and I don't know which ones, B: but they've been in office since the, the nineteen forties A: Uh-huh. B: and I, B: they've never had a job. B: I mean they've never gone out in the real world and, and paid normal taxes. A: Um. B: I know they pay taxes, B: but they don't A: Yeah. B: you know, they, they get paid a hundred and twenty-five grand a year. Which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit A: Uh-huh. B: and, you know, I'm going, like, I, I don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than I am A: Uh-huh. B: and they work less, you know, less than I do. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh, the only the only problem I see with term limitations, uh, is that I think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in, with most governments is just so complex that there's a very you know, there, there is a learning curve and that, you know, you can't just send someone off to Washington and expect, you know, his first day to be an effective, uh, Congress person. A: Uh, I think, I think there really is a, there's a lot they need to learn, you know, when you get there. B: I think, I think that's true, B: however, I think that's always been true. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, that's true of the Presidency, too, B: and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover ever eight years or four years. B: And, uh, A: Yeah A: but, B: They, B: I mean, there is a lot to learn, B: but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up. B: I think two years is too short. A: Uh-huh. B: I think it would have to be extended, uh, you know, B: a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms B: or you would increase the length of the, of each term of a Congressman. B: Uh, but maybe standardizing on, on a, a four year term for Congress Senate and the, the Presidency and then, uh, staggering them so that you don't, A: Uh-huh. B: we aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years. A: Uh, the other, the other thing that, uh, bothers me about our system is just that, uh, in, for, for, in, in, in Congress the amount of power any, any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there A: so it's, you know, for, you know, uh, A: so unless you have actual, you know, across the board uh, limitations, the, uh, you know, the idea of, A: well, we're going to just, we're, A: I'm, I'm just going to, you know, vote, vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work, A: you know, it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time. B: Uh-huh. B: I think, I think that that's true, B: but then you have, you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, the C I A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency. B: I mean, the action isn't in West Virginia. B: I hate to tell the the senator from West Virginia this information, B: but it really doesn't B: the world does not revolve around West Virginia uh, as far as this country is concerned, B: the world does revolve around D C, you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned, the national politics A: Uh-huh B: and the C I A is a, a very large, very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia, B: yeah, you know, B: it might only be two hour drive from here, but that's a two hour drive A: Yeah. B: and, uh, you know, it, it's a, I think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that A: Uh-huh. B: or is it the F B I. B: I don't remember, B: but I think there's, A: Well, I mean, A: I don't see why it makes a big difference the C I A because, you know, officially they don't do, they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative. B: Yeah, B: that's officially. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, we all know that that's not necessarily true. B: But I, I think that there are, there are advantages to having seniority and, uh, or, not having a complete turnover every, some small number of years. B: I think there are, I mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain. A: Uh-huh. B: But I think that, uh, all, with all the perks that we've given them, B: I mean, I heard on the radio back a, a few weeks ago, uh, during the incidents where they were, you know, like they aren't paying their, their restaurant bills B: and they're bouncing checks all over the place A: Uh-huh A: Uh-huh. B: uh, one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks. B: Well, we have, B: we used to, when I was younger A: Yeah. B: we'd go every weekend. A: All right . B: But we haven't done whole lot of it lately. A: Yeah. A: I'm kind of into it. A: I'm, uh, kind of a sailor. B: Yeah. A: I'm up in Minneapolis now, A: but I was in Florida A: so, uh, yeah, A: I was kind of into it for a while there. B: Were you sailboating? A: Yeah, A: for the most part. A: Yeah B: Yeah. A: I had a little sail, B: Well, we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here A: No B: Just motorboat's all we, A: What part of Texas you from? B: Uh, Nacogdoches. A: Okay, A: whereabouts is that? B: That's between Houston and Dallas. A: Okay, A: all right. B: It's the oldest town in Texas. A: Is that right? B: Yeah. A: Wow, A: that's pretty wild. B: We have, uh, Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches, B: so we do a lot of boating on. A: Okay, A: so you got some lakes around you can do that on. B: Yeah. A: You do skiing and stuff A: or, B: Yeah, B: little bit. A: Yeah? A: All right. B: Just got through snow skiing A: Yeah? B: Yeah. A: All right. B: Just came back from Denver B: but, A: Yeah, A: that sounds good. A: Yeah, A: we've, uh, our, A: the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now. B: Yeah, B: it, it, it was heavy when we were there though. A: Yeah. B: I didn't see any boats there, though. A: Not, not, not too many, no. A: But, uh, no, A: I just got back from a weekend. A: We went and, uh, had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing. A: It was pretty nice, A: but, uh, no, I, I have, uh, I had a boat last summer that I took out, a catamaran that I do, did a lot of sailing on and stuff. B: Yeah? A: That's a lot of fun, A: but, uh, my parents are pretty big sailors, too, A: they're kind of into it. B: Uh, all we, all we have up here mostly bass boats. A: Oh, yeah, A: I guess it's pretty, uh, fishing's a pretty big thing, huh? B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Lot of, lot of fishing going on up here. A: Yeah. A: All right. A: So, where about in Texas is that? A: Is that centrally located A: or, B: It's, uh, well, B: you ever heard of Lufkin? A: Uh, no, A: what, what major city is nearby? B: Houston. A: Okay, A: and that's south or north of there or something? B: Let me see, B: Houston's north. A: Yeah? A: Okay. B: Dallas is south. A: Oh, okay, A: all right. A: Well, that sounds pretty good. A: Does, uh, A: I guess the weather, A: does that stay pretty constant there A: or, B: It's, it's gets cold at night, and then warm in the afternoons. A: Yeah? B: Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon. A: Okay, A: well, that's pretty temperate. A: Yeah, A: that's not too bad. A: But, uh, yeah, A: have you done, uh, any other boating then A: or, B: No, B: I hadn't done any in a uh, lately, B: but that's all, B: I used to uh, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop. A: Yeah? B: And we used to, when I was in high school, we used to go out, go boating every day just about. A: Oh, that's great. A: Yeah, A: I, B: And we had a different boat every day. A: Oh, that's fantastic. A: Yeah, A: I used to, uh, kind of be that way myself when I lived in, uh, north western Florida in the panhandle, A: I used to sail about every day. A: I'd work, go to work, B: I'd like to do some sailing. A: Yeah, A: it's a lot of fun. A: It's, uh, A: especially if you get a, a pretty fast boat A: like those catamarans are pretty fast. B: Yeah, B: what, A: You can actually, B: Do, if you get one like that do have somebody teach you that B: or they just, A: Well, actually, I, I've known how to sail pretty much my whole life. A: Uh, my family's pretty into it B: Yeah. A: and, uh, I took sailing lessons when I was about six A: and then, uh B: Is it pretty easy? A: Yeah, A: it, it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, you know, uh, just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and, and the physics behind it. B: Yeah. A: So it's, it's not too bad, A: it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think A: and, uh, generally, everybody I've, I've known has kind of gotten into it, A: but some people are more motorboaters, you know which is fine. B: Yeah. B: Well, that's about all we have A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: lot of people don't, don't see the excitement in sailing, A: but, then, again, they may they may never have tried anything like, uh, catamaran B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, that's when you really start getting into speed. You know, A: you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people behind, the skiers, A: they get so fast, you know. B: I didn't know that. A: Yeah, A: they get pretty quick, A: but B: That that would be something. A: uh, A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: I haven't, I haven't personally done that, A: but, uh, the races, A: I, I work with a guy right now that, uh, races catamarans in the summertime B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, he's pretty gassed about it. A: He's got a good, uh, B: What kind of, what lake do you all use? A: Well, he, uh, he's from Detroit B: Uh-huh. A: so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes, I think, and does his sailing. Uh, A: for me, I, I go back to Orlando, uh, in about a month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast. A: We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast, A: and there's a lot of places there you can go, you know. A: So, uh, so that's a good thing. B: Yeah. A: But, yeah, so, what do you do for a job? B: Uh, I build transformers. A: Oh, really? B: Yeah. A: Okay, A: is that for T I A: or, B: No, B: it's for Cooper Industries. A: Okay. A: Are they primarily electronic, then? B: Yeah. A: Okay. B: Well A: Well that, B: they have a, you know, worldwide, B: but A: Right. B: all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that. A: Oh, okay. A: Great. A: Yeah, A: how do you like it down there in Texas? B: It's real nice. A: Yeah? B: Been here all my life. A: Oh, no doubt. B: Yeah. A: Okay. A: I've never been to Texas. A: I've been to Oklahoma, A: but, uh, that's about as far as, B: Oh, it's, Oklahoma's nothing like it. A: Yeah? A: Okay, A: well, that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well B: Okay, B: so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products? A: Uh, not too bad really. A: Uh, I had a razor that I got from Christmas that I just, I really didn't want it, A: but I got it anyway A: and, uh, it was a Braun A: and they were real good about taking it back. A: It wasn't a problem at all, A: so, uh, I was able to get that back pretty easily. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, I don't know, A: I really haven't returned a whole lot lately. A: Have you? B: I haven't had to. B: It's, uh, the, B: every so often, B: I mean, I, I, I'm almost pushing it myself. B: Maybe I'll buy a shirt from G I Joe's B: and it shrinks too much B: and say, well, I should have known better, B: I mean, I bought it from G I Joe's A: Um. B: and it was probably made in China by slaves. A: Right B: But, uh, they, uh, B: most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, I get pretty good stuff. A: Yeah. B: I think that, uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized A: Right A: like, B: and if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find. A: Exactly. B: It's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the U S A: I was reading, A: Right, A: I was reading something in, uh, CONSUMER REPORTS tonight about that as a matter of fact. A: They were talking about cars, uh, the car issue just came out. And about how, yeah, you'd like to buy an American car maybe B: Uh-huh. A: but, uh, you know, the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever. B: Yeah. A: Uh, like I've got an eighty-six Ford Ranger A: and, and I know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi. B: Huh. A: You know, so it's like, what are you going to do, you know? B: Yeah, B: really. A: But, uh, that's the way it is. A: I don't know, A: I, I personally feel that, uh, uh, if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them, you know, that's the way it goes A: and, you know, people, more than manufacturers should get a clue A: and, you know, they should start making quality products. B: Yeah, B: I think they're beginning to. B: The, the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away B: and, A: That's what I thought, too, until I saw the CONSUMER REPORTS issue. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, they've got all the American, well, all the, all the cars rated, you know, A: and, uh, essentially, I I don't see much of a trend. A: I mean, just like every other time that you look at it, the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there. A: There's nothing wrong with them. Uh, and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars. A: But then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy A: and they're pieces of junk. B: I know. B: Still at it, hey. A: Yeah, A: that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one. B: Wow. A: But, uh, I don't know, A: maybe they're getting better, A: maybe they're starting to get a clue. Uh, B: Well, they got a three year lead time. B: It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so A: Yeah, A: that's just it. A: Technology that comes in right now is, is probably not going to be implemented until, you know, quite a few years down the road. A: But, uh, B: The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer. A: Oh, yeah. A: Yeah, A: because technology is so, uh, you know, volatile and changing all the time. B: And can you think of any other industry where in software they, A: Uh, B: if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the mail . A: Yeah. B: Or, uh, maybe I say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade. A: Yeah. A: It, A: uh, they keep up with it pretty quickly A: and that's, that's a real good thing, I guess. B: Yeah. A: Uh, I don't know. B: And the hardware, well, I mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity B: and the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along. A: Yeah. A: Right, A: they're kind of the leaders right now, you know. A: I used to see all those commercials for Windows, you know, A: and you're like, oh, gee, they're reselling a MacIntosh under a different name. B: Really, B: why don't they just say, almost a Mac for half the price. A: Yeah, you know. B: They'd sell more if they were honest. A: Exactly, A: almost is the key word, there, too, you know, because I, I really, I've used both A: and I really don't see an advantage of Windows at all. B: Yeah, it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure D O S. base. A: Uh, A: Yeah, yeah that's true, too. A: But, uh, I don't know, A: I'm really, I've gotten a little bit out of the, the personal computer business just because I don't have one at home. A: I, I do use a Mac at work A: but, uh uh, I really don't, don't do much with it at home B: Uh-huh. A: but, uh, B: Apple's sort of making a B: and they're ones were B: growling consumer, uh, need to worry about the Mac they're getting, B: like if you bought a power book straight off, a lot of them had to go back. B: They issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with floppy drive. A: Right. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: you sound like you must, uh, work in the computer business. B: Yeah, B: I have one, B: I do desktop publishing at work B: and I have a machine at home B: and I belong to the user's group B: and I, I've been a Mac fanatic since they came out. A: Yeah? A: All right. B: But, uh, technically, I'm not actually in the industry. B: I don't work a computer company. A: No? B: I'm an abuser. A: Well, that's, that's all right. B: But it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know, keep up with the changes as they happen. A: Yeah, A: that's true. A: Something that I find uncomfortable is, you know, you, you want to buy something, say you want to buy a personal computer A: and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for, you know, A: let, let's take the example, the modem for, you know, B: Yeah. A: Okay, A: what baud rate do you get? A: Well, you know, it used to be that you get a twelve hundred A: So, um, how do you feel about the crime in your city? A: Is it, uh, B: Well, um, Minneapolis isn't too bad. B: Uh, I know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, that's kind of gone up in scale and, and some other things. B: Uh, I personally had a little experience the other day. B: Uh, somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck. A: Oh, really. B: But, actually, you know, when you look at, at Minneapolis as compared to where I used to live, it's really quite a bit better. Uh, because I came from Florida A: Uh-huh. B: and in Orlando, there's, crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever, B: so. A: Oh, yeah. B: What part of California are you from? A: San Jose, California. B: Oh, really? B: I have a good friend there. A: Here, you know, the real problems are the gangs. B: Yeah . A: A lot of gang related, a lot of murders, uh, just in general the whole, A: we've only been here a couple of years. A: Uh, before that we lived in Colorado A: but in comparison to Colorado, it's real noticeable. B: Oh yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean you can just feel, I mean, I can just sense, A: I mean I won't even, I won't go to the grocery store at night. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: that's A: You know. A: And it, it's that kind of thing A: and, uh, B: That's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like, A: Yeah. A: We have a neighborhood watch program in the house, uh, the development that we live in, which I think is a great way to reduce, uh, home theft, burglary, and things of that sort. B: Sure. A: Do you have that where you live A: or, B: Well, uh, interestingly enough, right before I moved up here, B: I'm an intern B: and then I go back down in May. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, but in Orlando, before I moved up, we had a real problem with it. B: Uh, we've been broken into in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks. A: Oh, no. B: And one of the things that I, I helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, because they were just, B: it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: and then the houses were left unguarded, uh, B: but yeah, B: I think given that people are pretty conscientious about it, B: that's a good way to, to work it, with a neighborhood watch. A: Yeah. A: Well, you know, uh, also I've heard that, uh, the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home. Like on the weekends. B: Oh, is that right? A: A high percentage of, uh, free time, A: I think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is, uh, spent doing yard work outdoors. B: Oh. A: So they wait while you're out, outdoors. A: They know the house is unlocked A: and then they just slip in. Slip in, slip out, you know. B: That's amazing. A: They know exactly what they're going for. B: Yeah. A: So, I've heard that's really on the rise as far as uh, you know, a new type of crime. B: Uh, B: Yeah, B: it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter. A: Yeah B: Really, you know. A: Unfortunately, yes. B: Yeah, B: unfortunately it's starting to really, you know, look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, the, the crime level there, of course, is quite a bit, quite a bit, uh, more pronounced, uh A: Uh-huh. B: but, uh, yeah. B: I guess, A: I mean, B: I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis, B: I'm not real sure. Uh, A: Yeah, A: it helps to know your neighbors, you know. A: They give you, A: you're supposed to make lists of, uh, cars. A: Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development. If I see a car that's unfamiliar, we, we have a list A: is that what you, you did in your program? Where you have a list of license plates? B: Pretty much. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: I was, I was basically, involved in that, in the organization of it. A: Uh-huh. B: And then I left right in the middle of it. B: I'm not sure where we went from there, A: Oh, uh-huh. B: but, A: Yeah. Well. B: Yeah, B: that, that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings, noticing people who look suspicious uh, activities like that, sure. A: Uh-huh. A: I mean, you, you hate to be paranoid A: but there are really only so many things you can do. A: You can have the house alarm, uh neighborhood watch program, you know, uh, as a woman not go out at night B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: uh, you can do that which is what I choose to do. B: Yeah. B: One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited A: Yeah. B: even, even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps, A: Uh-huh. B: it's against the law to do a lot of things, you know. B: They could basically, uh, B: when I was getting robbed down in Florida, I was really considering electrifying doors um, things like that like A: Uh-huh. A: That's, A: Uh-huh. B: they did in Miami that time. A: But it's not, uh, A: if you kill someone in your home, as long as they are in your home, it's considered self-defense though. B: That's not always true. A: It isn't? B: No. B: There was a, there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed A: Uh-huh. B: and essentially what he had done is set a, a a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home. A: Uh-huh. A: Huh. B: The guy came in while he was home B: and, sure enough, he fell into the trap and was severely burned. B: He didn't die, B: but he was severely burned B: and he took the guy to court and won a settlement. A: Really. B: Yeah. B: So that really, that makes you think, you know. A: Yeah. B: It's like your hands are very much tied. A: Yeah. A: Well I think if, if you had a handgun though, in other words it wasn't premeditated, you had a handgun, it's the middle of the night, someone's A: Uh, I've had, uh, three boys through, I guess, uh, some child care, each one of them A: and now they're in school A: so it's all over A: but, uh, I guess I would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want. B: Well I can profit by this because I'm due with my first in about three months. A: Is that right A: I guess, uh, the only rule, uh, I can think of is that I like to look for places with, uh, good respectable, nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that. A: If they're associated with a college or a university, they're usually a pretty good bet. B: Huh. A: Uh, I think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something. A: You'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care. B: I guess not, B: I suppose you're absolutely right there. A: Yeah. A: For profit places, I would really look at them awfully carefully B: Uh-huh. A: but, uh, when I was when my kids were young, I was teaching at a university A: and, uh, the child care center associated with our university was quite good A: so I felt confident that they'd do right. B: Uh-huh. B: Of, B: aren't don't they kind of use them for, everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs? For their for their pet theories or some such thing? B: Yes. A: But, yeah, A: I suppose, uh, if you're, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another, A: I guess that's true. A: But, uh, I never had bad experience in that respect A: Of course, you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents, A: and they, you know, A: pretty good people B: Um. Well, the thing I really worry about is, uh, the sexual abuse cases you read about. A: Uh-huh. B: And I mean you'd just feel awful if something like that happened. A: Yeah. A: I never really worry very much about it. A: I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public A: so, I never really worried too much about that being, uh, uh, the case with my boys. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: Uh, I, you know, I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them A: but B: Uh-huh. A: I don't think it's as common as, uh, the newspapers would make you believe B: Uh-huh. B: And another thing is cost. A: Oh, yeah A: I mean that, B: I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now B: and they finding, in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare. A: Right. B: Um. A: Well, in our case, we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were, uh, in school. A: And I'm really happy we did it, although it was very, very difficult. A: And I think it was the right thing to do B: Um. A: and we were, uh, we just decided that we would do it A: and we went ahead A: but, uh, not everybody can make that choice A: and even, even though my wife wasn't working, we did have, uh, one or another of the boys in, uh, child care for just for part of the day. Uh, or a couple of days a week just so that, uh, other things could get done around the house and so on, A: so, So, we did look around. B: Huh. A: I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not A: and, uh so I would always trust her judgment on that. B: Huh . B: Huh. Well I'm just thanking heaven. B: My husband just got a new job. B: His last company, he was only working four days a week. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's, B: and he just got a new job. B: He's getting lots of overtime, B: he got a pay raise B: and so I'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not. A: There's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid A: so, yeah, do it as long you can B: I suppose. A: But I think, you know, you have to look through a place A: and you have to get a feel for, uh, how they treat the kids and, uh, uh, what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And I think you have, the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open. That you're welcome anytime without notice, in the middle of the day and so forth A: and if they're at all queasy about that then I'd look elsewhere, yeah. B: You have to start wondering if they don't want you. B: Yes. A: Right B: Huh. A: You have other friends that have kids, uh, being taken care of in, uh, child care? B: Uh, I have one B: but I haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while. A: Uh-huh. A: So. But, I really think the news reports are, uh, tend to sensationalize the problems. B: Uh-huh. A: I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and, uh, pay and exhaustion and you know, things like that, rather than these, uh, uh, really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy. B: This is true. A: Yeah. B: CURRENT AFFAIR can get several shows child cases. A: Uh-huh. Well, A: Why don't you go ahead and start. B: Okay. B: Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement. B: Uh, trial by jury is good B: but a lot of time a lot of cases, uh, is circumstantial evidence that, that convicts a person, which I don't think is all the time good. Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent, I mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness. B: And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me. B: I don't know. A: So you think if, if trials were held by judges or experts, that they, they would tend not to, uh, admit, not to convict people on circumstantial evidence? B: I think so. A: You know, I, I attended a trial in, uh, Germany when I was a student A: and, uh that's the sort of system they have. B: Uh-huh. A: The trials are held by a panel of three, uh, three or four judges who are, well, A: they're like lawyers I guess. A: They're experts in the law B: Right. A: and, uh, there, there really isn't a jury A: and, uh, uh, they do the questioning also. A: The judges do the questioning A: and, uh they, B: Uh-huh. A: uh, A: I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they, uh, uh, the judge is also sort of a jury, uh, A: but I'm not sure I like that A: I think I prefer the jury system myself. B: You think you prefer the jury? B: You think your chances are better? A: Uh, well, actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference Mondays and fly back on Fridays, A: well, any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles, A: so I saw, I went to Disneyland about five times, in one year B: Oh A: and I really have no great urge to go back now. B: That's great as a kid though, isn't it, I mean, A: Oh, it was great, because, uh, well, the times that were really fun were when, uh, we had vacation A: but the kids in Los Angeles didn't B: Uh-huh. A: so we basically had one of the parks. B: Right. A: Uh, Disneyland, I mean there's still a lot of people at Disneyland, A: but there was another, um, another amusement park down there, Busch Gradens, uh, A: there was nobody there when we were there, we got, we won a log floating ride like five straight times, A: we just get, get done with them and they go, oh, do you want to go again, A: sure. B: Have you ever, B: you've never been down to Epcot at Florida and Disney A: No, A: I'd like to, sometime B: that's good, A: but, B: we, we really enjoy that, B: we've been two or three times and probably go back again this winter. A: Yeah, A: I've never been, A: the fartherest south I've been on the East Coast is Charlotte. B: Oh. A: So, I, um, keep wanting to get further, A: you know, I thought I would go to Florida a couple Summers, ago B: Uh-huh. A: but never did it. B: Charleston is a really nice place to visit. A: My, uh, my sister lives in Charlotte A: and they've gone to, Charleston a couple of times and had a real good, time. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: it's a real pretty place. A: Uh, yeah, A: one of these days we'll get down there, although I don't know when we're going to have vacation to do it A: We're, uh, we're getting married in about, a year B: Oh, are you. A: and, our honeymoon, we're going up to this, um, uh, place in Wisconsin called Door County, B: Yeah. A: it's up by Green Bay. A: It's a place my girlfriend's also wanted, to go, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, B: Is it on, uh, one of the lakes? A: It's, um, uh, A: I don't if you've ever seen a map of Wisconsin A: but there's kind of like a little, a little thing sticking out, uh, in the Lake Michigan, B: Uh-huh. A: that's Door County B: Oh, okay, B: yeah, B: that would, be really nice. A: So, A: Yeah, A: they call it the Cape Cod of the, uh, the Midwest B: Oh A: so, uh, we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun, B: Uh-huh. A: she, uh, she had this, uh, book of pictures from it that were really nice, kind of like a travel guide B: Uh-huh, B: sounds good. A: so, uh, that should be a lot of fun. B: Well, I don't know what our next trip will be, I guess our next, B: well, I know what my next trip, I'm going to be a grandmother in July A: Oh. B: The first, the first one, A: Oh, boy. B: so my next trip is going to be to Texas A: Oh, that'll be fun B: Yeah, B: in the middle, in the middle of the Summer. A: Well, yeah, A: you won't even, notice it though B: Well, they'll be air-conditioning anyway B: so. A: Is that, is that how you got into this, uh, this, you know, uh, data base? B: Yeah, B: my daughter's a temp at Texas Instruments, and working on this project. A: Oh, okay. A: Yeah, A: I was, I was just, A: I mean most of the people I've talk to are from, are from Texas, B: Uh-huh. A: so, when I, you know, when I heard you were from Virginia I was like, oh, okay, there's somebody different, A: and you said, oh, I got somebody down in Texas, A: I go, okay, that the connection, right there B: That's it, B: yeah B: I talked to one in California, B: I never asked him the other day how he was connected, B: I don't think he was T I employee. A: Uh, I, uh, A: most people talk to Texas, A: there's been a couple of other the people, uh, most of whom are like me that work in, in speech labs that are going to use data base, eventually. B: Oh, I see. A: So, uh, it was fun A: I, actually yesterday, I ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab I'm in. B: Is that right. B: Well, we spent last week end in Charlotte with real good friends that had just, moved to back East from Oklahoma, A: Oh. A: Uh-huh. B: and she's, uh, working on this project too, B: I mean she's talking on the project too A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, we got back Monday B: and I got a call yesterday B: and it was her, on T I Network A: Uh, that's neat. A: I haven't, uh, I haven't had something like that happen, just, uh, just getting the one guy, from the lab. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, you're sure have a nice town, A: uh, my, uh, sister lives on Lake, Norman, just, B: Oh, does, she, B: that's nice out there. A: Yeah, A: uh, we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the Summer A: and it's, never really works out. B: Uh-huh, B: yeah, B: it's real pretty. A: Yeah B: Well A: Traffic , not much else we do for vacation really, A: uh, just so we don't, haven't been able to take really. B: Are you a golfer? B: No. A: No. B: Me either. A: No. A: Are you guys, golfers B: No, B: uh-huh, A: or, uh, B: no, B: uh-huh, B: nope, B: not too much into sports. A: Except our outside , though. B: Just walking that's all A: Oh, I don't think there are any, traveling that was in my early teens down in that area A: and I'm know real sure there are, um, B: No professionals A: When, uh, A: I was thinking I might be minor league A: but, B: Oh, there's one in Salem, Salem Rebels. A: Yeah. B: Salem Rebels, A: Buccaneers. B: Buccaneers. B: Oh, okay. A: Yeah, A: um, yeah, A: I may be seeing them, um, in a town just west of here, Frederick has a, uh, has a minor league team that plays in the same league with Salem A: and, uh, I think we may be seeing them this, weekend B: Oh, B: is that right up there in Frederick? A: Yeah, A: I think they're out of town. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Uh, that's a nice little town actually, Frederick, uh, B: I've never been up there. B: I've never visited Baltimore. B: I'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime. A: Oh, there's, there's some nice things in Baltimore, you know, A: the Inner Harbor and the, uh, the Aquarium and all that are very nice. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, they've just done a, uh, A: you known, I, A: you know, the Aquarium is one of those things that, you know, because everybody, A: Okay. A: uh, we're going to talk about our lawn and garden chores, A: do you have either one? B: Well, I don't do anything with the lawn really, B: but I do gardening, both flowers and vegetable gardening. A: Do you . A: Oh, really? B: Um, I, B: we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden B: and that's fun, B: well, actually Wally's had one even when we haven't had big yard because, um, we enjoy that. B: We love fresh vegetables in the summer, B: and it's just one of the things I enjoy doing. A: So do I. A: I would, A: I had rather be outside than, than inside any day. B: So would I A: Do you work during the week, uh, outside the home? B: Yes, B: I do. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, so I manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward, B: I work for a school system B: so I'm able to do that, um, because I get home a little earlier, A: Yes. B: and I can still do some, some sorts of things B: but, A: Or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight. B: Oh, absolutely A: Well, I unfortunately am not gardening this year. A: I love gardening, A: in fact, I was prevented at like no, about thirty years ago with a life membership, uh, from the Richmond, Virginia counsel of garden clubs. B: Wow. A: And it wasn't because I was so good, A: but I organized a very large garden club, A: but I still have, uh, B: Oh, that's wonderful. A: It, well, it's always something that seems so odd to me A: but, uh, B: But that, that's, B: and you really feel you can accomplish something B: and to help other people too, that's neat. A: Yes, A: it has really nothing to do with, uh, actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that, B: Uh-huh. A: it was just that I happened to organize this group, that was about seventy people. B: Right. B: That's wonderful. A: That, A: isn't, A: yeah, A: that, that, B: Yeah. A: those numbers were, were great A: but it, B: Yeah, B: well, I think it sounds good. B: I've never belonged to a garden club because I've always been more interested in just doing what I can do on my own, B: I've never had, the time really to get involved in the organized sort of format, A: Yes. B: but I know people who do it and, and enjoy it very much. A: Well, and actually, I think that most women's garden clubs that I've been aware of in the past, uh, are only flowers, A: what I would like, A: we've spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma. A: Just moved to, to North Carolina, B: Oh. A: and, uh, we were originally, of course, from this area, from Virginia, A: but, uh, in North, uh, A: in Oklahoma, it's the men's garden clubs that I would have wanted to join. B: My word. A: And you would have because they do all kinds of, uh, gardening and not just flowers like women do. B: For heaven's sake. A: Uh-huh A: Uh-huh. B: Well, um, there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that I know of, B: they're, they're women. B: But, um, and usually they're the tea type things, you know, where they have a little luncheon B: and they do their thing. A: Uh-huh. B: But, um, flowers are primarily the emphasis, um, whereas I enjoy vegetable gardening almost more, I do flowers sort of look pretty A: Yes, A: I think so too. B: but I, I really like to do the vegetables. A: Yes, A: and, and I have spent the last ten, ten years being a florist. B: Being what? A: Being a florist. B: Oh, my. B: Well, what a wonderful thing. A: It was nice, A: it was exhilarating, uh, for many years. B: Yes. A: Uh, many of those tanned until the last couple when, uh, we had such an economic slowdown. B: Oh, terrible B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: well, tell me what's in your garden this year, since I don't have one. B: Okay. B: Well, uh, the flowers I'm just, B: in fact, I was going to go out today to buy some plants so I could put them in, B: I, I always have geraniums B: and, um, and then I have a shady area that I need to, uh, be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun, A: Uh-huh. B: so I've discovered that, uh, impatiens that tried and true is, turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus. Because they, uh, look pretty and, in my front garden, uh, A: Uh-huh. B: but I like the vinca which is something I hadn't, B: they look sort of like impatiens, B: you know, but they're not quite B: and they're better for the sun areas. B: Um, and, of course, you know, the, mine are old theory ordinary flowers, marigolds and, and that sort of thing. A: Yes. B: In my, A: Do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds? B: No. B: I don't. A: Maybe it's, B: I don't know, B: maybe this climate is a little better. A: Yes, A: uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: Um, but in the vegetable garden we grow, um, usually, what B: our favorite is something called white half runner green beans , B: now that's, A: Do you, A: isn't that funny, A: so is my favorite. B: Well, you know why, because I grew up in North Carolina, A: Okay. B: and that was my mother's, um, favorite bean B: she she always grows, you know, five different varieties, A: Yeah. B: but that's the kind that produces the best. A: Yeah, A: well, I think it has the best flavor. B: And, and they're wonderful, B: and I pick them when they're very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit, B: my mother picks them when they're fat B: and she cooks them for an hour with some fat backs , A: Yes, A: uh-huh, A: well, I like them in between. B: and they're good both ways. A: I like them in between. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: The flavor is better I think in between. B: Oh, in between the B: size wise B: yeah, A: Yes, A: yeah. B: yeah. A: Uh-huh. A: My mother, B: Well, my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them A: Well, and I know I love them, A: well, that's the yankee way. A: But I think, that's like another vegetable. B: Oh, of course. A: I love them that way just, just the thrill of, B: Yeah, B: it is. B: They're two different vegetables that way, B: uh-huh. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: In fact, I, my mother, who is eighty-six years old, canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year. B: Oh, my gosh. B: My does, mother will be ninety this year B: and she lives in western North Carolina B: and, uh, she would do that if, if we didn't tell her that she'd better not A: Yes, A: uh-huh, A: yes. B: But she doesn't have that big a garden, B: but she has a bigger one than I do. A: yes. B: And I have four children, you know, B: so, A: And she tends to it herself? B: Oh, yes, B: oh, yes. A: Uh-huh, A: isn't that wonderful. B: Oh, it is, B: it's great. B: It's, it's really her joy B: and I suppose that's why I enjoy gardening, because, you know, growing up with it. A: I think so too. A: Yeah. B: We also grow, um, yellow and green squash, um, much to my children's chagrin, A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: and, uh, we grow a lot of tomatoes, uh, A: Uh-huh. B: there's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes. A: No. B: So, we enjoy that, B: um, we grow B: I, I have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family B: but I actually was successful for the last two years, B: so. A: Wonderful. B: I'm going to do it again. A: Bet you showed them. B: That's right. B: And we grow broccoli. A: Oh. B: And I have been very, uh, happy about the new way of controlling the, the, uh, worm that gets in broccoli, um, by using the Bacillus Thuringiansis which is the, uh, little, B: well, in fact, that's what they use for gypsy moth, B: I don't know if you have had that problem there or not. A: No. B: But it's, you know, it's a problem that's, that's moving south from, from the New England area. A: Yes. B: And they devastate the trees B: so they, they spray, the government, uh, sprays, um, two, three times in the spring when the, uh, caterpillars are, are coming along because what they do, this, this, uh, bacillus, um, the worms ingest it B: and it expands in their, in their, um, digestive tract B: and they die. A: Uh-huh. B: So, that's the same technique that is, you know, for any of the other, uh, little varmints that get in vegetables B: so it, B: that's really very nice because it's a non toxic way of, of handling the problem. A: Great. A: Well, we could we could really talk gardening a long time. A: I'm enjoying hearing you so much B: Well, it's nice hearing you talk B: and I'm, I wish you, uh, good luck, B: have you just recently moved to Charlotte? A: Um, A: no, A: October. B: Oh, so, well, that's not very long. A: Uh, so, yes, A: recently seven months A: and it, B: Yes. A: the weather is wonderful, A: I love it. B: Oh, that's great, B: that's great. A: It is just terrific, A: you know, rains a little too often. B: Well, I hope you have a, an opportunity to garden again. A: Oh, I think so, A: I have a little spinach B: Oh, well, good A: Bye-bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Okay, A: so, um, how do think, how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years? B: Uh, I'm at a little bit of a loss, B: you know, I don't know, B: ten years ago, B: see I'm what, I'm about, uh, twenty-eight now B: so when I was eighteen, A: Uh-huh. B: things haven't changed a whole lot. A: Really. B: People are being a little more, oh, I don't know, a little a little less bigoted in some ways, B: I don't know A: Uh-huh. B: seems to me. A: Well, B: I guess I'm like my parents. B: The younger generation gets away with hell, B: but, uh, A: Yeah. B: Well, it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted B: but that may just be because I've changed. B: You know, I used to live up north. B: Down here, Dallas, seems to me, the police are militant A: Really. B: but, uh, A: Where'd you live up, A: where'd you live at, B: I lived in Akron, Ohio. A: Oh, did you? A: I'm from , Illinois, A: so. B: Oh. A: How long, how long you been in Dallas? B: Oh, about eight years. A: Oh, really? B: In fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it gets more and more, gets to be more and more restrictive place to live. I think, A: Yeah, uh A: you know, uh, as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do. B: Yeah, B: I think it's, B: crime has gone, got a lot worse in the last last ten, fifteen years, A: Oh, yeah, A: I agree. B: and maybe that has a lot to do with it. A: Yeah, A: I, I definitely think that has gotten a lot worse, A: and you know, I, I think there's, A: to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values. B: Yeah, B: that's true. A: So, B: That's true, A: But, uh, B: I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved A: Yeah. B: but that's more a matter of, B: you know I'm no longer a teenager in high school. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I think there's more pressure like on both parents to work, and things like that than there used to be A: and, B: Hello. B: Somebody's at the door. A: So. B: Hang on just a second. A: Okay. B: off Okay. A: But, uh, I don't know, A: that's just, that's one thing I see, I see a lot more, you know, double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that, I guess. B: Yeah, B: that's true, B: it's getting more and more expensive to live. A: Yeah, A: that's for sure. B: You can't, you can't make it, A: Yeah, A: without it hardly, A: that's right. B: I guess, when I was growing up, it was, it was still the ideal to get a, get a home and buy house, B: and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever A: Yeah. A: Yeah B: you know, you just don't buy a house, A: just because they can't get into one, A: yeah, A: that's right. A: Yeah, A: the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured, you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways, B: Yeah. A: so. Yeah, A: that's, that's a good point A: so, I'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years. B: Yeah, B: for me it's kind of hard, B: I don't know. B: I think, B: I don't know, I think the middle class is shrinking and the, uh, lower class is expanding A: Oh, yeah, A: I agree. B: and sooner or later there's going to, there's going to be a turn around. A: Well, I hope so, you know, at some point A: but I don't know at what point, B: But I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class, uh A: Yeah, B: so, usually is I think. A: Yeah. A: It's, uh, B: It's hard for me to say. B: I hope it happens, because I'd be one of those that gets caught. B: But on the other hand, there's a lot of injustice that needs to be, be changed. A: Yeah, A: that's right. A: Do you work at T I? B: Yeah. A: Do you? B: Yeah. A: What, uh, department do you work in? B: I'm in semiconductor. A: Are you? A: I'm in semiconductor division too. B: Yeah. A: So. How long you been with them, since you moved down here? B: About eight years, B: yeah. A: Um, I'm over at the Center One building. B: Yeah, B: so am I. A: Are you really. A: What floor? B: Two. A: I'm on the seventh floor. B: Well, A: How about that. A: Well, it's a small world. A: So, so let's see, A: second floor, you work with, uh, linear. B: Yeah. A: Do you. Do you, uh, do you know Alec Morton? B: Yeah, B: I've probably seen him around. A: Oh, you do, huh. A: Well, he comes up and pushes us around A: so, uh, so I'm pretty familiar with, B: Are you D A D or something up there? A: Huh? B: Are you D A D or something? A: Yeah A: Yep, A: you must know him. A: His reputation precedes him. B: Yeah, B: well, seventh floor. A: Yeah, B: T A D, A: Well, uh, he, uh, boy, he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief. A: They, they say it's what makes him happy is to give us D A D grief, A: so I can believe it A: but, B: Well. A: Yeah, A: let's see, if you've been in Dallas eight years, I guess that's about how long, A: I've been in here about eight years, too, I guess. A: Um, been with T I like twelve, A: but I started out in Lubbock. A: Lubbock is, A: I don't know, A: I guess if this is the only place you've lived, Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas. B: Yeah, B: flat, dry and dirty, A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back, too, A: I mean, here in Dallas everything is just real rush, rush. B: Yeah, B: I lived in the country for several years, B: and living in the city is a whole different uh, social structure A: Oh yeah. B: but, uh, A: Well, I got some friends that, uh, A: seems like he went to school at like DeVry. A: Is there a DeVry in Akron? B: I don't even know A: Oh, B: I haven't been up there in years. A: Oh, I see, A: well, he went to school somewhere in Ohio, A: and he's from that area, A: and, uh, he works over in the Park, Park Central building I think A: but, uh, I haven't talked to him in a while, A: but, um, yeah, A: he, he misses it. A: He used to go back twice or three times a year, you know, because he missed it. A: Sounds like you haven't been back there in a while. B: No, B: I haven't been back in ten, fifteen years. A: You still have relatives back there A: or, B: Yeah, B: I do, B: I just haven't had a chance to get back A: Oh. B: Catch them next year probably. A: Really. A: Well, let's see, A: how, how long are we supposed to talk here? B: I don't know, B: I think we ran out of social, social changes to talk about, B: so. A: Yeah, A: well my kids are probably needing me to go A: so B: Okay, A: all right, A: well, it's nice talking to you. B: Yeah, A: Talk to you later. B: All righty, B: bye. A: Bye. B: Well, Kathleen, do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system? A: I certainly do. A: Uh, I think ... I think we have a lousy school system. B: And what do you think that problem is? A: And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we don't train our teachers very well. A: And then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents. A: And then, oh, we don't, uh, we put too much, uh, responsibility on the teachers, for things that are really not education. A: They're social services. B: Huh. That seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before. A: Well, I, as a matter of fact, I just finished editing a book on the topic. A: So I have some rather strong opinions. B: That's interesting. B: Do you, like a uh, yourself ... A: And, and I'm sure they're colored by what I've edited. B: Do youself have children who are or have been through the public school system? A: Yes, A: I do. A: And I was not very happy with the results. B: I see. B: So if you were to improve it, what would you do to improve it? A: Well, I think I would start with a with getting rid of about two-thirds of the administrators. And all the auxiliary personnel. The school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: And then I would provide, uh, use the money that we've paying them to, uh, provide some special help in training and particularly, uh, mentor teachers to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time B: Uh-huh. B: Sure. B: Sure. A: And then let them try some innovative things and see what works. And then, uh, have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who could benefit from the same sorts of things. And then from the parents' side, have the parents support the school. Get involved. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: Pay attention to what's happening. Talk to the teachers. Uh, talk to their kids about school. And support the institution A: and, A: instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the, uh, the teacher's in the middle. B: Uh-huh. B: That's, uh, some pretty good ideas. B: Why don't you do something with those A: Well, I've done about all I can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, you should, uh, run for a school board position. A: Oh, well. That I'm not so sure about. A: I've got a lot of things to keep me busy. B: Uh-huh. B: That ... A: Have you done anything like that? A: Anything political? B: Well, my mother was on the school board. As we were coming up. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, that, basically, is the extent to which our, our family has been directly, you know, B: they've always been involved. B: My parents through the, the P T A organization. B: And my mother was on the school board for eight years. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, that was, that's the extent of which I guess that's more than, than some people, less than others A: That's more than a lot B: I would, uh, tend to agree with you that there is a problem B: The methods of correcting it I haven't thought through quite to the detail which you have. B: But I believe that there's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of even being a teacher. A: Uh-huh. B: And if there was a way to, through the public mind, set that image to be a little higher esteem, a little, uh, uh, a little more prestige to being a teacher. B: And with that, of course, you know, you have to pay them a, accordingly. B: If we paid them more, it would attract more the, the higher educated people to, to either move into that field or to continue in that field. A: Yeah. B: And then if you paid them more, you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them. A: I think that's absolutely right. A: They, A: the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board, you're going to be, uh, rewarding people who've been doing a lousy job. And instead of getting the, uh, improvement that we want. B: Sure. B: Sure. A: So we'd have to have some way to, uh, reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a, a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money. B: Uh-huh. B: It, unfortunately, it's a, and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible as other ones A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: It's, it's hard to tell. B: so it's very, it's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one, other than I guess how, you how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class. B: You know, if there's some gauge that they could make. A: Yeah. B: Uh, also, I've I've thought around about the idea of making teaching and the B: before you can get a certificate, you have a, a certain residency period. So much like a doctor. B: Maybe not the four years definitely. B: But some certain type of, of position where you're overseen to begin with. A: Yeah. A: Now that's a very good suggestion. B: Uh, just something to, B: rather than throw someone in, into that environment, uh, you know, it A: Yeah. A: I don't think student, I don't think student teaching is enough. B: I thought that maybe something. A: I think that, at least what I used to observe in student teaching, was that some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with, was thrown into a class room with a teacher who was harried and overworked and, uh, had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions to pay much attention to the student teacher. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: And then the student teacher didn't stay but about six weeks. B: Uh-huh. A: So there really was no time to try, much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the, the student teacher improve very much. B: Sure. B: Sure. A: There are lots of things that could be done in that line, including things like video taping. Because it wouldn't be hard with all the electronic equipment that's around these days to video tape, uh, either a master teacher teaching a class so that then, students could watch that and, uh, criticize the methods used and, and analyze it. Figure out what worked and what didn't work. B: Uh-huh. A: And then also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance. B: Sure. B: Sure. B: That's good as a, a, a teaching aid. B: But more you see these commercials that have Jimmy walking into class late and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who is in New York while Jimmy's in Rome. A: Huh. B: And, you know, the whole electronic classroom idea. B: I don't know if I I'm in favor yeah, in favor of, yeah, A: I don't think that's going to work. B: I think, especially in the younger years you need to have more of the, the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to, to learn how to learn. A: Yeah. A: Well, another thing I think would be helpful would be to have some sort of, of say a national curriculum. Because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for, uh, curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in Texas and California. A: And then everybody else is stuck with that, regardless of what they want to teach. B: Huh. B: Is that because that's where the two biggest markets are A: Because it ... B: or? A: Well, that's the two states that adopt on a state wide basis. B: I see. A: Uh, and so it, uh, A: I used to work for a textbook publisher A: and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by Texas, then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject A: and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted in the individual school districts. B: Uh-huh. B: Huh. A: And, you know, a third of the Texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks. B: Sure. B: Sure. A: And then the states that either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids, just have to follow along and take what Texas gets. B: Right. A: California is the biggest for elementary schools A: but Texas, uh, adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade. B: I see. B: Well, definitely is a national problem if, that they need to address. A: Yep. A: Sure is. B: Definitely is. A: And I hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with, uh, Reagan's, uh, new education secretary and, uh, you know, trying to do some, uh, trying to produce some new programs anyway. B: Right, B: right. A: Excuse me. B: Well, I've enjoyed speaking with you. A: I have got to go. A: I've got another line calling. A: Thanks. B: All righty. B: Good-bye A: Bye A: Okay, A: sorry. B: Wow, B: that's okay B: So, tell me about your home. A: Oh, it's, uh, it looks like a little shot gun house, almost. A: It's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other. B: Uh-huh. A: It's, uh, an older home, A: it's not new, A: I like it though, A: it's big. B: Oh really, B: what kind of square footage? A: Oh, I wouldn't know, A: I measured it one time, because I was, uh, we had saw some termites B: Uh. A: and we thought about getting it sprayed. A: I think it was like, A: I can't remember, A: I'm sorry B: That's okay, B: that's okay. A: It's big enough for us, though. B: Uh-huh. A: We kind of need maybe one more room. A: We've got two children. B: Uh-huh, B: okay. B: So where do you live at, B: I mean what part of town. In here in Denison. A: Okay, A: see, that's north. B: Or down here in Denison, B: yeah. A: Okay, A: I live, I live in Plano, A: so it's north to me B: Okay, B: up here then A: I say down, A: I'm really from Kentucky. B: I was going to say you didn't have the typical, B: you have a southern accent, A: Uh-huh. B: but you don't have a Texas accent. A: Right. B: Well I'm originally from, uh, Ohio, Cincinnati, A: Oh, okay. B: so I'm uh, familiar with, uh, A: That area, A: that dialect. B: Right, B: right B: Also I lived in Georgia for about four years, B: so the, uh, B: there's a difference too, between east and west, in the south. And, uh, the way in which people speak. A: Uh-huh. B: Anyway, my home is, um, I guess it's about twenty-five hundred square foot B: and I have, uh, four bedrooms at the present. B: We're busting out walls and things like that. A: That's what I want to do. A: How many kids do you have? B: We have two, B: we have two. A: Do you have enough bedroom space, then? B: Yeah, B: we'll have enough bedroom space, B: it's, B: we're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small. A: Uh-huh. B: And so, we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it. And then shuffle the rooms around a little bit. A: That's kind of like what we'd like to do. A: We just had a baby a couple months ago A: and we've got a den, A: it's more or less a spare room. B: Uh-huh. A: We rarely go in there, except for to play chess. B: Uh-huh. A: We want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter A: and, uh, we need the one extra room. A: Like, like you said, our rooms are too the bedrooms are too small, A: the living room and kitchen are huge, B: Right. A: but the bedrooms are too small. A: Where you've got to leave the furniture just one certain way, you can't rearrange it at all. B: Right, B: there's they, uh, B: I know what you're saying there, B: ours is the same B: and they tend to put windows in the strangest places. A: Yeah. B: You know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for, A: Yeah, A: we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom. B: Uh-huh, B: you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything, B: so. A: No privacy. B: No, B: we don't have a lot of that, B: yeah. A: Well, we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house. A: It, B: Uh-huh. A: I'd hate to clean these windows, A: I really would. B: I figured I'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean. B: Ours are the double pane B: and you can't really clean them on the inside, you know. A: Ours are those too, A: yeah. A: You must live in an older home too then. B: Right, B: I do, B: the house is about, um, I'd say almost thirty years old. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's not a new home, B: it's, it's seen some wear and tear. You know. A: Ours has too. A: When we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it, B: Uh-huh. A: and he did it hisself, A: so most of that, by now, is falling apart. B: Oh. A: You know, well I mean, it's not just horrible, A: but like this tile's come loose off the wall, A: the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile A: and I don't like that at all. B: Um, that is awful. A: With that, uh, the great big tiles, square tiles like, that you put on the floor, the, the huge one. B: Uh-huh, B: he did it in that? A: Yeah, A: instead of wallpaper. A: I wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles, A: for that you put, B: The normal tiles, B: right. A: right A: that you put around a bathtub, A: that would be prettier. B: Uh-huh. A: But this looks like floor covering on the wall. A: It just doesn't look good. B: Oh, and also they're very heavy B: and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier. A: Right, A: there's one big one that has come off A: and short of putting nails through it, we can't get it back on, A: so. B: Um. A: And he rewired the house A: and it's shorting out here and there, A: and B: Oh, wow, B: I, B: that's one of the things we've been fortunate with, is our, uh, wiring is okay. B: We don't have a, we don't have enough power, B: um, or our breakers aren't, aren't powerful enough to take, to, to really help with the load in the house. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean we need to redo some, rewiring ourselves B: but our plumbing is awful. B: There is there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work, A: Um. B: and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house, B: so if something breaks, we have to shut it off from the main, in the street, you know, A: Yeah. B: and, oh, it's, it can be really bizarre. A: Yeah. B: And we never know where it's going to flood. A: We've got power surges on the west side of our house. A: We've got our stereo hooked up. B: Uh-huh. A: Well that, A: the power makes it run. A: It's never ran, A: it's always ran just fine, the clock and stuff. B: Uh-huh. A: But it runs about ten minutes fast, except for about a month, for about a month the, the clock ran normal. B: Um. A: And then the power went off again, A: lightning or something knocked it out A: and we hooked it back up A: and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again. B: Um. A: But on the east side of the house it runs fine. B: Oh boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there. A: He put new wiring in, A: it's all new wiring up in the attic, or I guess crawl space, B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: but, uh, oh, no, A: he didn't know what he was doing, A: he really should have hired people. B: Well that's something, B: my husband's in construction B: and he won't even touch electrical stuff. B: He, B: I mean, he'll do a little things B: but he won't do any major rewiring. B: He says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it. A: Right, A: he'll end up killing himself. B: Pardon. A: End up killing theirselves. B: That's right. A: My husband, he'll change out a light switch, A: but that's about as far as he'll go. B: Well that's the way mine is, you know, A: Yeah. B: I mean, he, he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around B: and he was like, oh my God, B: he says, looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there. B: And we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry, A: Uh, was a what, B: The roof was really sorry. B: I mean when we moved in, we had no idea how bad it was. A: Uh-huh. B: It was a wood shingle roof, B: and we, B: the first year we were living there, we had to replace the roof. A: Well he put, A: which A: I heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles. A: Is it three or five, A: your husband probably knows. B: He probably knows, B: I don't know what it is off hand. A: Well, he's got seven layers of shingles up there, A: and he told us it was a completely new roof. A: Like I said, he didn't know what he was doing. B: Yeah, B: he must not of. B: We stripped ours, we stripped ours off. B: We didn't put it over, 'cause we put composition roof on. B: And we completely completely stripped all the old wood shingles off, put decking up, put the paper down, and I mean just started from scratch. A: Uh-huh. B: Unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain. A: Oh, no. B: And we, and we had, we had almost, I'd say about half of the roof off, B: and it did this. A: And, uh, uh, a house full of snow. B: And a house full of snow, and rain, A: Uh-huh. B: and it came down, B: it did this in the middle of the night. B: We have plastic, you know, just tied down on everything, you know, as best we could, real thick edge stuff, I mean, A: Uh-huh. B: and the wind came in from the north B: and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night B: and we were asleep B: and, and I woke up B: and I got up B: and it was about four o'clock in the morning B: and I heard all these, these drips, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip. A: Oh, no. B: I had water coming in every light fixture. A: That, A: yeah. B: I had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling, everywhere. B: And I mean it filled up my light fixtures, because they're the old kind. A: Uh-huh. B: And I would go in, B: and I'd turn on a light in the room, you know B: and the light would come on B: and the whole thing would be full of water. B: And I mean the light would still come on. B: It didn't blow up or anything A: My neighbor, or a friend of mine when I lived in Louisiana, her, A: we all lived on base, A: my husband was in the Army. B: Uh-huh. A: She woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning, water dripping from hers. A: The neighbor's uh, washing machine had uh, over done something, A: I don't know A: but it was leaking, just pouring water in A: and it all went through to her roof A: and it was coming out of the lights, fixtures. B: Oh. A: The fire alarm went off for some reason. A: It shorted it out, or something. B: Oh, yeah, B: that will happen. A: So she woke up with about six feet of water in her house. B: Oh, my lord. A: No, A: not six feet A: but, B: But it's quite a bit, quite a bit, B: you know that, A: Yeah A: you might as well A: so. Did you have carpets and stuff? B: Oh, several of our rooms got ruined, B: we have, um, B: we are on pier and beam, B: we don't have concrete slab underneath our house, A: Uh-huh. B: so it, it got into the carpeting, got into the floor. B: The carpeting was already awful anyway, B: but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink A: Your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too. B: Oh really. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: they came in B: and they had it, B: one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it. B: We had to call the insurance company. B: I mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof B: but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof was being repaired. You know, which really wasn't our fault. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather. You know, and stuff A: That's right. A: That's right. B: and, A: Well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end. B: Oh yeah B: it, A: Are you finished with it now? B: Uh, the roof? A: Uh-huh. B: Oh yeah, B: yeah, B: it's, it's been done for quite some time. B: We're really glad with all the rain we've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof. A: Uh-huh, A: how long have you lived there? B: Uh, see, it's three, B: it's just been at three years. B: We've been in the house just the three years. B: We've been doing a lot of remodeling. B: I mean, it's, it had detached, it had a detached garage B: and my husband's built a walkway across B: and we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that B: so we, A: You all did it yourselves? B: What, uh, the walk? A: The home improvements. B: Oh yeah, B: yeah, B: he see he does this for a living, A: Uh-huh. B: I mean this is what, A: All right. A: Well, uh, quite a few A: and they're varied. A: They don't, uh, uh, encompass, uh, many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing. B: Uh-huh. A: But, I do, uh, quite a bit of wreath making A: and my dogs are my hobbies. A: I do a lot of gardening. A: I go to estate sales, which takes up a lot of time. B: Uh-huh. A: Now, what do you mostly do B: Well, mostly right now I'm a, I do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible. B: We're, uh, we're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff, A: Oh, B: so. A: boy B: Yeah. A: That should be fun. B: Yeah. B: Fun for them. A: Yeah. A: How old are they? B: Uh, I've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three. A: Well, I think that's better than having that party at home B: Yeah. B: Well, uh, this is a friend's party B: and they, they rented, B: or, you know, they, B: the party, B: they, uh, just rent skates and stuff for the kids. A: Yeah. B: So, uh they're, they're looking forward to it. A: And, the the, the skating rink does the rest practically, I guess. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Uh-huh A: Boy, what a help that is. B: Yeah B: So, uh, A: What kind of, B: how long have you lived in North Carolina? A: Well, not that long. B: Really? A: Uh, just since October. A: We moved here from Enid, Oklahoma. B: Oh. B: Uh-huh. A: So, uh, we are, we're originally from Virginia, this part of the country. B: Uh-huh. A: But, we did spend twenty years in Norman and Enid and loved it. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: But, we needed to get back, uh to our older parents. B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: But, I am loving it A: The weather is divine. B: Really? A: Yes. B: uh, B: did you like Oklahoma, while you were there? A: Oh, yes. A: Very much. A: Yeah. B: Um, what did you all do? A: Well, my husband was with, uh, begins to be much clearer, a lot less back ground noise and University of Oklahoma and, Phillips University in Enid. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And then he went with, uh, a family corporation that had, uh, has oil and ranching and varied enterprises. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, he just quit a perfectly good job and came, we came East B: Really? A: Yes. B: So, is, uh, is he working there then B: or A: Yes. A: Uh-huh. A: He's doing, uh, quite a bit of consulting work and, has been offered a permanent position B: Oh, uh-huh. A: and he's contemplating B: Uh-huh. A: He, he's liking this free time actually B: Oh, yeah. A: It's just wonderful after all, these years of working. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Well, how did, how did you get, uh, hooked up with the T I switchboard thing? A: Um, a gal who works, uh, with T I on this project B: Uh-huh. A: I think she's a temporary worker A: Uh, mother is my best friend in Virginia B: Oh, I see. A: So we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country. B: I see. B: Uh-huh B: my wife has talked more than I have, uh, B: she's talked to four, five different people. B: It seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from Dallas. B: In fact, she's talked to a couple of people from North Carolina, I think. A: Really? B: Yeah. A: Uh, what is her name? B: Her name's Tina A: Yeah. A: Well, I haven't talked to her. A: I haven't, I haven't talked to a Tina yet B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. B: uh, the, the call was probably for her. B: They wouldn't accept my, uh, T I N number, B: so we put hers in. B: But, uh, uh, like I said, we're getting, getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party, A: Yeah. B: so. A: Yeah. B: But, uh, some of B: yeah, B: I, I've only talked to one or two B: and they've, they've all been in Dallas. B: But, she hasn't talked to anybody, in Dallas, yet. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: So, that's interesting. A: Well, you haven't told me, uh, what sports that you are active in. B: Well, the sport I like best probably is basketball. B: But, uh, I guess I'm probably better at softball. B: And so I'd, B: like during the summer months it's, occupies quite a bit of my, time. A: Yes. B: But, I play in a couple of leagues and, and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend. B: But, my family usually goes with me. B: We try to do everything we can together. A: Well, I think that's, uh, easy entertainment for a, family, too. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Well, they, uh, B: a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams, we, uh, B: that's usually the team I play on with the tournaments and stuff, B: and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age. B: So they play together, pretty well A: Under the stands. B: and, A: Under the, bleachers. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: pretty much. B: And, uh, Tina enjoys, uh, the other lady, real well. B: So they, B: you know, that's kind of nice. B: It's like getting together with, them. A: Yes. A: Well, it's getting, a little hot, isn't it? B: So to speak. A: It, B: Yeah. B: Well, it's been raining a lot here so far. B: So we haven't really had any kind of real heat. B: I think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon, we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in, in the house. B: So, it looks like an air conditioner, day. A: Yeah. B: But, A: It sure does. A: Or maybe this evening anyway. B: Yeah. B: It, B: yeah, B: but, you know, I'm sure you're familiar with that living, here. A: Very, much so. B: We go, we go through Enid, you know, quite a bit. B: We go to Tulsa from time to time. B: And my, my parents live in southern Illinois. B: So, we drive, up there. A: Yeah. B: And, well, lot of times we take seventy-five B: and, uh, it seems like, seems like that goes through Enid, I know, A: No. A: No A: it doesn't. B: I've either seen the signs or, A: Enid is, uh, A: it's in the northwest. A: It's, uh, directly across the straight, uh, state from Tulsa. A: Uh, B: Um. I know I've seen, the sign somewhere. A: Sure you have. A: Yes. A: Well, Enid is, not, uh, an unknown little city. B: Yeah. A: It, uh B: Right. A: an awful lot of people know where it is, or have been there. A: And it, was, uh, a very, uh, self-sufficient, uh, wealthy uh, town, for a long time, anyway You know until, uh, everything happened, B: Uh-huh. B: Uh. B: Uh-huh. A: the bottom fell out. A: But, B: Oh, uh-huh. A: it's beginning to do well. A: But, there's a lot of, uh, old time wealth there that, has helped to stabilize things. B: Oh, uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: So, uh, how B: you said you've just lived in North Carolina just like, six months then is, A: Yes. A: Something like that. B: And you really like, it there, huh? A: Oh. B: I've heard so many people talk about that area. B: I've never been there A: Well it's, it's and children in the pretty. B: but they sure, say it's pretty. A: The weather is wonderful. A: Uh, this winter we, A: it was just, A: we had so many wonderful days. A: And, B: Uh-huh. A: uh, I, A: if it got to be forty degrees, I decided it was too cold to, to walk the dogs A: Isn't it, funny how how, your standards change there's a little bit of everything in it. A: Right. B: You know, that kind of a thing. B: Uh, as far as like real novels, I haven't gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing. A: Uh-huh. B: I wish I had in, in some senses B: but I don't have time really as much as I would like to, to get into that kind of thing. B: How about you? A: Um, well, I like, like you said, real life, um, A: I like biographies of people's lives, like, especially like athletes, B: Uh-huh. A: for some reason it seems to interest me, like people that make a big comeback or, you know, Orel Hershiser, things like that. B: Sure. B: Uh-huh. A: And, um, I like to read books on improve, like family, marriage, you know, things that are written by like Christian authors or, um, doctors about family and, you know, how to improve your home and all that kind of thing. A: Um, I like to A: the magazines I A: to A: I like to read , A: I read a lot of bicycling magazines. A: They're, A: I mainly look at the pictures and stuff, A: but they usually have some good articles in it. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, I don't know A: I haven't really found any romance type stuff I like to read. A: I, I'm more true, you know, uh, nonfiction. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: I haven't found a lot of, uh, fiction books that I really like A: but, uh, not to say I wouldn't, B: Yeah. A: eventually I mean. *one utt or two with a.29? A: What was the last book you read? B: Uh, jeez, B: let me think, B: it, B: I tell you I haven't read a book in a long time. B: And it, B: I can't even really remember. B: Uh, I think it was a romantic novel by Danielle Steel or one of those. A: Really? B: You know yeah, B: honestly. B: Um, I don't do as much reading, like I say, as I would like to. A: Yeah. B: working a lot of hours at work B: and, A: Really? B: Yeah, B: and then, of course, we have a home A: I know. B: so it's, you know, B: a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or, you know, that type of thing. A: Yeah. A: I, I set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is like about eleven more books than I would have read last year, A: but so far I've only read like two books A: and so I'm not doing very well A: but, B: But see I do crafts too, A: Yeah. B: so it's hard, B: I, if I have a minute that's what I, I do. A: Yeah, A: I find it's real hard, A: I let papers, newspapers stack up and magazines stack up, if I don't really set aside a time to look or read them. B: That's the, B: and, and that's like myself B: I've, I've, I miss it, because I really find it a very relaxing hobby too. A: Yeah. B: I really do B: and, um, I don't know B: it seems like you can get lost in a book, you know, B: it, it, it's like an escape for me. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't know about you. A: Yeah. B: It's, B: if I'm really interested in what I'm reading, I mean, hours can go by B: and I, I look up at the clock and say, oh, my word, you know. A: Uh-huh. B: In fact, I'd rather read sometimes than watch T V. A: Yeah, A: oh, I would too. Kind of train your mind. *sv^2 B: But I think you get out of the habit, like you say, B: you have to like kind of set yourself, B: Yep. A: Have you ever read, uh, or heard of the book THIS PRESENT DARKNESS? B: No. A: That was one of the books I read this year, A: and it's really fast paced and intense. A: It was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book A: but it was A: it was one of the best I read, A: I mean, it was real good, A: and it was, um, it was one of the few books that A: like it, you know, A: just hurry up and go through without putting down, you know. B: Yeah, B: right. B: See that's the other problem I have. B: If I start into something and I really enjoy what I'm reading, then I have a terrible time getting away from it too. A: Uh-huh. B: I'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning, you know, because I'm so engrossed in it B: and then before you know it, it's time to get up and go to work. B: You know, that type of thing. A: Yeah. B: That's why B: I, I don't know B: I'm, I'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that. B: Even if I'm, uh, doing something like an afghan, if I'm close to the end, sometimes I'll do the same thing. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't know what you would call it, B: maybe I have a problem A: No, A: I'm sure it's fast or something. B: It's terrible, B: I, I really like books that, that you can get into B: and that's that. A: Uh-huh. A: I know what you mean. A: I like reading late at night right before I go to bed sometimes A: I just sleep better or something. B: Oh, yeah, B: you do B: you kind of get relaxed, B: that's true. A: But, uh, B: I have a lot of craft books that I have too and, uh, magazines. B: I like PEOPLE, you know, those things that are about real people. A: Uh-huh. B: And, um, I, I like to, uh, read about people who have been a successful, you know, who, who made a success of their lives. To, to give you specific titles I, I can't. *sd A: Yeah. A: Which, what book have you read that is along those lines, that was really good? A: Well, how about who, B: Like I say, haven't done it in, in such a long time. A: Do you know who it was about? B: Um, well, I went to, uh, seminar on, uh, B: it was for, by American business B: and some of the people, uh, B: what the heck was his name, B: I'm trying to think. B: He's one of the, uh, B: Paroe, *spelling: Perot B: and um, it was more like, oh, B: it was tapes and things that they had about him, too. A: Uh-huh. B: How he started out as just a salesman and now he's, you know, multimillionaire and that type of thing, B: and how you have to, uh, be aggressive and, you know, really want something for yourself and that type of stuff. B: It's like up to you, in other words, whatever happens in your life. A: Yeah. B: It's not up, B: it's not someone else, B: you have to do it. A: Yeah. A: And then do it. B: Do it. B: I can't, B: I'm not that focused on something. B: I, I'm off in all directions. B: Um, and I'm not, uh, uh, a planner which I wish I was. A: Uh-huh. B: You know, kind of off the wall. B: If someone says, do you want to do this tonight, uh, and I got a mountain of things to do, it's okay, you know, we do it. A: Uh-huh, A: huh. Well, that's all right. B: I know, B: I know, B: but I wish I was more the other way. A: You're more fun though, see. A: You're not ridged right? *spelling: rigid B: Yeah, B: right *listen: sarcastic or not? B: I, I, B: that's B: see , I like it that way though. B: I, I, I would, I don't want to change that part of me. A: That's good. B: That's funny, B: even though I admire someone who isn't, like I am, you know, and, and I wish I could be more that way A: Yeah. B: but, A: There may be some schools you could read about and learn. B: That's true, B: that's true. B: How many people do you supervise? A: Uh, about twenty. B: Oh, that's not bad. A: No. B: That's not bad at all. A: No. B: Do you like your job? A: Sometimes. A: Sometimes more than others. A: But, yeah, A: I do. B: Oh, that's, oh, that's important. A: I've been there about three years. B: Do you have a family? A: Yeah, A: I just got married last year A: and, um, most of my family's in Indiana. B: Oh, uh-huh. A: So, I've only been in Texas three years. B: Do you like it? A: Yeah, A: I do. A: I love the weather down here. B: I, I loved, I loved Abilene too. B: That's what I liked, too, is the weather. A: Yeah, A: I know. B: Except for tornados A: Boy they, they have storms here A: I've, B: Yes B: they do. B: And it, it, it's so surprising how it just happens, you know. A: Hail and thunder and, A: Yeah. B: Unpredictable. A: Were you here during the hailstorm two years ago? B: Uh, no. B: Oh, I've been up here about three. B: Uh, we were down there, uh, from eighty-six to, eighty-five to eighty-six, B: no, uh, B: well, part of eighty-four to eighty-six I should say. A: Yeah, A: boy I had thirty-three hundred dollars damage done on my car, A: a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail. B: Oh, wow. A: I think State Farm went bankrupt. Just about B: Oh, jeez. A: But, uh, B: I know the whole situation is bad up here, B: we're having a terrible time with the recession. A: Really? B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: It's not good at all. A: Huh. B: I know things are pretty booming down there. B: I heard they sold Johnson City though . A: Yeah, A: and Colorado Springs. B: And Colorado Springs? A: Yeah, A: I talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day A: and he was telling me about it. B: Oh, wow. A: They just sold it. B: Amazing. A: Closed up and moved down to McKinney. B: Oh, well, that's good. B: At least they kept the business part of it. A: Yeah. B: It's scary though I'm telling you. A: I know . B: I don't know, B: and, well, you know, with the other part of this thing was, how do you feel that this influences family. A: How do I feel what? B: That, that books influence, B: do you know how to use them in your life or to influence, A: Uh-huh. B: I, I feel like it's important for young children to read too. And what you read to them. A: Yeah. B: When my children were younger, of course, B: they were all married and grown B: and I have grandchildren now, B: they were, uh, B: I, I read to them a lot. A: That's good. B: And, uh, I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also. A: That's A: yeah. B: I'm not saying they read all the right things B: but they do read. Uh, where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all, B: and I think it's important, A: Oh, yeah. B: because, uh, even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens, I mean, they don't learn anything. B: It's because they can't read. A: Yeah, A: it's really surprising how many people graduate from high school, and that I work with B: Yeah. A: and people, I mean, A: I get memos all the time across my desk A: and things are misspelled A: and, it's really, It's pretty sad. B: Oh, it's unbelievable, B: isn't it? B: Yeah. A: A lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read, you know. B: Exactly, B: and I think that that's why reading is so important, A: Yeah. B: because, uh, I think even mentally when you can do some, A: I don't, A: guess we got our first, uh, credit card, oh, back in the seventies, early seventies when, I first got married B: Uh-huh. A: was a Visa card. Uh, issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City, B: Uh-huh A: because my sister worked at the, uh, the Visa some Bank Americard center there. *one utt with a.3 utt2? B: Uh-huh. A: So, we were still in college A: and had she not worked there I'm not sure that I would have qualified. A: They've come in handy over the years. B: Yeah. A: Uh, and they have become, or, also a, a real bother sometimes. B: Oh, tell me about it A: Especially, you know, if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation, it's just easier to put everything on a card. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, I find if you're not careful you wind up, uh, a month or so, staring those bills in the face A: and you go I don't remember doing all that stuff A: and it adds up. B: Yeah, B: they add up quick A: So, sometimes, uh, especially traveling with T I, you know, everything goes on American Express, B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, as far as personal life goes, I guess, I really try to use them as little as possible, uh, A: I kind of like having them for, uh, gasoline purchases. B: Yeah, B: we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies, you know. B: But, A: Yeah. A: But other than that, uh, I, I guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome, of just putting everything on there day after day after day B: Uh-huh. A: and then, then you really get socked to it, if you don't watch it. B: Yeah. A: How, how do you look at counting credit cards? B: We just, uh, quit using them A: Well, that's, B: And they got us in trouble, B: we took a loan and paid them all off. B: We keep them, uh, we keep, uh, one gas card and, uh, and, uh, Visa just, you know, in case there's an emergency or, something A: Right. B: but other than that we don't use them anymore A: Well, that's kind of the way we were doing A: it's, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: I guess for that very reason that, that, uh, if you're not real conscious of what you're doing, it's just too much by the time you get, B: Uh-huh. A: well, if you got a bunch of cards, you get a bunch of bills every month B: Uh-huh. A: and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid. B: I know, B: isn't that funny? A: Yeah. A: And I give them, A: maybe not, maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid A: because they're, A: know if you don't, then they're adding on, what, eighteen, nineteen, twenty percent. A: Sometimes, it's twenty-two percent interest. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: and then some of them add late fees on it, if they don't get paid A: Yeah. B: and, A: I guess that's one of the motivations behind the, the, uh, the, uh, American Express card with T I, B: Uh-huh. B: Huh. A: there's no, B: Huh? A: with the American Express card from T I, there's no, um, late fee, B: Uh-huh . A: there's no, uh, interest rate, B: Oh, really? A: you you either pay the thing off A: or they come get it. A: And it's turned into personnel A: and they come get you A: So, they've got quite a bit more motivation I think to get paid then, some of the others do. B: Oh, yeah. B: Yeah. A: But that's the one that your call center manager sees every month, B: Uh-huh. A: so, you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that, even though you can use it however you want to. A: Oh, yeah. B: Oh, you can? A: You can use it like any other card, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, but, it, you know, you kind of, you know that somebody every month, B: Oh, I see, huh. A: and who knows how many people, are looking at those, uh, bills that come in, and those statements, B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: you're not the only one. B: Yeah. A: So, uh, you want to make sure that, uh, is that okay, A: is that okay, that those people see what it is that you are buying, B: Yeah. A: and most of the time it is. A: But, most of the others I've sent back, I mean, all you get is card offers, *two utts A: I've got three card offers now, uh, from gas companies and, uh, Visa Gold and, uh, some, other bank, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: Citibank I think is always sending the Visa stuff out. A: And I usually just throw them away because I, I don't want another one, B: Oh, I do too, B: I don't even open them much, B: I throw them out. A: I don't want to have to mess with it. A: You know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, one of these days it's going to all be full. B: A girlfriend of mine found a, B: it was a Visa or MasterCard, B: she found an ad for one in like a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING magazine for eleven percent. A: Oh, that's not bad. B: shoot I need one of those A: Yeah. A: No, A: if they don't say, no annual membership on them, I'll throw them away. years ago, well, I had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for, *sd oh, probably fifteen years, B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: and then they started charging, uh, annual membership fees, A: and I said, adios, I'm, you know, I'm not paying you, B: Why do they do that? A: It's just another way to make money, as far as I can tell. B: I mean, I mean they get enough, you know, on the interest A: I mean, they've been, A: Well, sure. A: And they, I guess, they figure they've got enough people out there with cards, A: they're going to get cards at the , twenty bucks a pop. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: There's going to be that much more. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, so, then a couple years ago I found, uh, a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was, you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership. B: Uh-huh. A: So, I went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account, in his name, and got my Visa card, A: so, as long as they have no annual membership fee, I, it would be okay, B: Uh-huh. B: Huh. A: but I can't see paying someone to use their card. B: No, B: I can't either. A: Be charged their eighteen percent interest, Yeah, B: Yeah. A: I think you're right. A: The best philosophy is have them if you need them, but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere. B: Yeah, B: really. A: Yeah. B: gets a lot of people in, in trouble A: Yeah, A: it sure does. A: Maybe they're counting on that, A: I don't know. A: Well, I guess that's it. B: Okay. A: Thanks for talking. B: Nice talking to you. A: Bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Do you have any particular thoughts about the school system? B: or Well, um, I, I think that in, in, uh, B: recently with the, B: I'm not sure if it's more a problem with American families or a problem with the school system. B: They seem to be burdening the school system more and more with problems, any problems that a child might have, whether it's actually a school related thing or not B: and, I. A: I say agree with you a hundred percent there B: Yeah, B: and, and, well, it's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything. A: Yeah. B: If, uh, you've some kid who doesn't have, uh, who's from a broken family, the schools are supposed to fill that void. uh, you know, teaching classes and maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like, oh, were kind of traditionally the school's roles. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: it's interesting A: because, uh, we're just having conversation on this, uh, with a couple of people yesterday. A: And I was expressing my frustrations that, uh, some of the, so many problems, I work in a high school, are that kids don't have a, a degree of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large. A: Uh, and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract, uh, sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home. B: Right. A: Um, and, it's seen more so because when you call parents up, many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem A: and I'll say, they'll say, oh, well, our kids, my kid, A: I've never heard anything about this before. A: This is the first time there have been problems. A: And, and, you wonder, don't these parents know that teachers talk, A: and, you know, we do check with other teachers, A: and other teachers find the same things in this child. B: Right. A: And, you know, how do you tell your parent's, the parent, hey, wake up, and smell the coffee B: Right. A: But, um, it, it is a problem, A: and I'm not sure just, uh, how, how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it. B: Yeah. A: Whether maybe through a commitment of the P T A, uh, and the parents being informed better, that in fact that the problems that are nationwide are problems, um, of society, and that, that the school can only do so much on it. B: Yeah. B: Well, then, then again when you have, uh, a society where a certain percentage of the parents are, uh, doing drugs in the home uh, either unemployed and don't care about a, uh, just a have their own problems how, how do you expect the school to, um, or how do you expect the, A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: you can't really expect that parent who's, quite frankly a loser in life, as it is to, to care about the, the situation with their child, A: That's right. A: Uh-huh. B: and, A: water You know what scares me too, is that we have yet to see other, the biggest effect of the crack children uh, in the school system. B: Right. A: These are children that are born with low deficit, attention deficit B: Right. A: and, gosh, what's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system. A: That's really scary water B: Yeah. A: But there are, I think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve, A: and this is something that I see. A: Too many times students get diagnosed as slow learners, A: and in fact they're not. A: They're behavior problems. B: Right. A: And so, they get put in, in, in our school system, in a class that's limited for skills children that have, really have to master skills. B: Uh-huh. A: And that's not their problem. A: Um, at the same time, I've seen, we, we have a, an international population. A: There's no bridge area for students coming out of the E S O L, which is English for Speakers of Other Languages program. B: Uh-huh. A: The, A: once they're past E S O L, they get out, A: they got thrown right into the total mainstream B: Right. A: and, uh, there really needs to be a bridge, some sort of transition for that. B: Right. A: So the school systems can improve, both in standing up for splitting classes, you know, having learning learning, slow, slow children in slow classes, but not mixing them with behavior problems. B: Right. A: And then, you know, the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes, A: you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated. B: Right. A: And then you throw in kids that are not motivated, maybe bright, but they're discipline problems. A: And you sometimes A: the average classes really are problems because you've got such a mixed bag there. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: You know, the gifted and talented are fast classes. A: There's really not that much of a problem with. A: But it's, B: Well, I, I've seen more, uh, incredibly intelligent underachievers than, than, uh, A: Uh-huh. B: I personally I will, I would take a person who's motivated and a little, uh, less intelligent than the person who, uh, is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of, isn't motivated to do anything. A: That's, A: yeah. A: I remember I had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration, and ninety-nine percent perspiration. B: Yeah. B: Well, I, not to toot my own horn here or anything, but I, I was graduated from my high school, B: I was the valedictorian, B: and I know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me, A: Uh-huh. B: and they proved out late when it came time to take the S A T B: Mine were good, A: Uh-huh. B: but they weren't great. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, when I got into college I struggled, I struggled just to, uh, get my degree in the, in the field that I was in. A: Yeah. B: Whereas I knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all, B: but they got motivated in college B: and they did a lot better than I did. B: And when it, A: Yeah. A: I guess kids do mature at different ages too. B: Right. A: That's, A: and, you know, as a teacher you, you try to make, be understanding that, you know, there are different ages, A: kids are, A: is this a, A: got a kid that just a question of maturity, A: or is he a problem child. B: Uh-huh. A: But teachers are asked to diagnose so much. A: Um, there, I mean, I mean we're, have to be, A: we're alerted B: Right. A: there's all sorts of systems where suicide, uh, predisposition. A: I mean, we're alerted to what the moment we see something. A: If we see a child that we have any reason, that's on drugs, such as if he's got a beeper or if they're, if they're flashing lots of money around. We've, there are certain things to do. A: I mean, so the school system's asked to do so much, A: but you can't operate in a vacuum. B: You actually have students with, with beepers? A: This is a, we're in a rather wealthy suburb of Washington. B: Uh-huh. A: And a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the, uh, principal. B: I mean, where, B: what are the, B: what could they possibly be thinking. B: I mean how. A: It's for drug use. A: They can't imagine for anything else. B: Yeah A: Yeah. A: You know, it's, it's amazing, A: but uh, you get all sorts, you get all, all sorts of things, uh, in the schools, uh, uh, A: and it's, A: and you know, as a teacher you're alert, you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy. A: You're alert to the kid who suddenly has a, um, behavioral change, A: and you refer them to the nurse. B: Right. A: And, so, I mean, you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason, or whether this is a warning signal. B: Yeah, B: can you, how can you, how can you expect to, B: Oh yeah, B: I, I, I was, uh, sitting in the barber shop. B: I'm an officer in the Air Force, B: and I was having my hair cut A: Uh-huh. B: and the barber got a call while I was there, uh, from his son's school. B: His son's in high school. B: And his son was failing gym and, uh, and having trouble, with a few other things. B: But, you know, it's like, uh, this guy was like, why now, there's no problem with my kid. B: My kid's a great kid and all this. B: The kid had missed all these classes, B: and basically he, his answer was, Oh, I gave him permission to, to miss. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: the denial mechanism is really strong A: and so many parents are facilitators. B: Yeah. A: I mean, they're manipulated by their children. B: Right. A: I've been fortunate. A: I have, uh, a son who's a sophomore in college up in Massachusetts at, uh, Amherst, B: Uh-huh. A: and my other son is a senior in high school, A: and he's going on to Williams. A: And I mean, they're really super. A: They're both national level swimmers, B: Sure. A: and where we've been very fortunate, A: but, you know, they had to be held accountable too. B: Right. A: I mean, you know, at some point a parent does help their kid, but in, in some ways, A: but, but you have to say at what point isn't the help becoming negative. B: Sure. A: And I think this is where the school system at, is suffering, and not through any fault of the effort of the school system. B: Right. A: But gee it was good talking with you. B: It was good talking to you too. A: Yeah, A: so there are people throughout the country that feel the same ways that you do, and, and are connected with the schools. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I've had interesting conversations on several subjects not, uh, not just this but different, the different things. A: Uh-huh. B: It's amazing how the, you know, people you talk to have some interesting conversations B: and, uh, it's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base, and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used at all A: Well, we are, though B: Yeah, B: that's true. A: Listen, A: good luck. A: Take care, B: Yep. B: Bye-bye. A: Bye-bye. A: Okay, A: well what movies do you like? B: Gosh, B: I like just about anything. B: We, I think the last one we saw was, uh, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PART TWO. A: Oh, now, I I like the turtles. A: My little boy's four A: and he loves them. B: Well, we don't have any kids B: but we like them anyway. A: Oh, that's okay. A: How old are you all? B: Um, we're late twenties. A: Oh, and you just don't have any yet, A: okay. B: No. A: Well I've got two. B: Oh, gosh. A: Yeah, A: my little girl is three months old A: and my little boy just turned four. A: I had his birthday party yesterday. B: Oh. A: But he's a turtle fanatic. A: He even had turtle cake yesterday A: But I've been wanting to see TURTLE TWO. A: Is it as good as they say it is? B: It was, B: it was actually better than the first one, I thought. A: Good. B: What's the last movie you saw? A: GHOST. B: Oh B: we were just, when, when the topic came up, we, I was asking my husband right quick, what's the last movies we saw. B: He said well GHOST and TURTLES. B: I really liked it. A: Now GHOST, A: yeah, A: I love tearjerker movies. A: But that wasn't too bad on tearjerker A: but, It was, oh, it was good movie, B: Not too awful bad. B: Yeah. A: Because that was just so good. A: And I like Demi Moore. B: Did you see PRETTY WOMAN? A: No, A: but I've been hearing a lot about it. A: I we don't get to the video store very often A: and we don't have cable. B: Oh, gosh. A: Well we don't really want cable, A: it's just, you know, glued to the T V all the time anyway. B: Yeah. A: So we get two channels down here. A: I'm from Kentucky originally, B: Uh-huh. A: and we used to get five channels without cable. B: Yeah. A: You know, forty, A: well I don't think you all have the same channels, A: but here in Texas we only get two channels, A: and that's, um, A: do you watch soap operas? B: Uh, once in a while, when I'm home. A: Okay, A: you work then? B: Yeah. A: Okay, A: well we get the channel with YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS on it. B: Okay. A: And then, uh, I think GENERAL HOSPITAL A: and that comes on different channel. B: Yeah, B: it does. A: But that's all we get, A: and that's no cartoons for my little boy. A: But we've got a V C R and a lot of tapes. B: Yeah. A: And, uh, my husband is a movie fanatic. B: I think you would really like PRETTY WOMAN, B: it was, it was really a, B: it made you feel really good. B: It was just a happy movie. A: Oh, what about TOTAL RECALL, A: have you seen that. B: Yeah, B: I saw that one. A: That's good. B: I, I was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was. A: Yeah, A: it was violent. A: I try to get away from that. A: My little boy, oh, he loves ROBO COP. A: And that movie, I have to, I'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is, A: have you seen it? B: Yeah. A: The part where they're shooting mercy . B: I don't like that. A: That, oh, that's horrible, A: that is horrible A: and their, their, the language on that's filthy. B: I don't see why they have to do that, B: I mean, I mean everybody knows that it, that the, the language is there so they could just ignore it and, you know, use different words instead, I think. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: I know. B: But I, I think lately PRETTY WOMAN'S been my favorite. B: I went and bought the video. B: I've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times. A: Um, my husband bought me, like, um, uh, I think PRETTY IN PINK for my birthday. A: With, a, A: wait a second, A: I will in a minute Kyle, to child in the A: Sorry. B: That's okay. A: Uh, he bought me PRETTY IN PINK. A: Just a second. A: the phone and talks to Sorry, A: now, you're glad you ain't got a four year old. B: That's okay B: Now, Now I haven't seen PRETTY IN PINK, Molly Ringwald? *br A: It this is the first time he's interrupted my phone calls. A: Molly Ringwald. A: Yeah. A: It was cute, A: but, it wasn't, A: I like the, um, SIXTEEN CANDLES, or sixteenth birthday or, B: I think, I think SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it. A: Yeah, A: oh, that was so good. A: Of course I was a teenager when I seen that A: and I loved it. B: I haven't seen it either. A: Oh, well if you like love stories, it's sweet. B: I do. A: Oh, it's sweet, A: it really is A: And that's a tearjerker A: it gets you, A: I mean it makes you feel really sorry for her. B: Oh, gosh. A: But it's hilarious too, especially with that, uh, little guy in it. A: Oh he looks like little, I don't know, he looks like a little boy next door, B: Oh. A: but he's sixteen. A: Oh, it's a cute movie. A: I can't remember his name. A: He kind of looks like DOOGIE HOWSER. B: Huh, I don't know. A: Don't know either. A: He's got curly blonde hair, A: he just a little freckly, little boy. B: Probably know him if I saw him. A: Yeah, A: if I could remember the name, I know you'd know his name, because he's played in a few movies. A: But, uh, B: I was just thinking another good one I saw not too long ago was, um, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. A: Okay, A: I've heard about that A: but I can't remember it. B: That, that's, that's Julia Roberts' new movie. A: Okay, A: yeah, A: Julia Roberts is good. B: Yeah B: she's, B: this one, B: you know PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and a romance, A: Uh-huh. B: and, and this one was a lot more dramatic. A: Wasn't it a murder mystery? B: well, A: Like, sort of B: it was like, uh, it was a, it was a mystery. B: She disappeared from her uh, husband who was abusing her. A: Oh, okay, A: the, yeah, that's the one I wanted to see where he was on, she was on a carnival, at a carnival on a Ferris wheel or something. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: Well did that come on T V A: or did it come out in the, B: No, B: it came out in the theater. A: Oh. B: And I think, you know, around here, it's all ready quit playing. B: But I don't, I don't know if it's still playing any where else. A: Well I, I think, B: But it was, it was, it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat. A: Real good. A: I want to see that. A: Yeah, A: I seen the, uh, previews for it on T V down here, A: but it's just been down here a couple weeks, I think. B: Oh, okay, A: Yeah. B: because we saw it, probably, four or five months ago. A: A month A: Well I know it hasn't been that long since I've seen the previews for it, A: but yeah, A: I wanted to see it. A: Her husband was a, dark haired guy with a beard and moustache, A: or A: no A: he shaved the beard off. B: Yeah, B: he's, uh, he was a real psycho in the movie. A: Yeah. B: It was, it was scary. A: Oh, I'd like to see that. A: What about, oh, A: there was a, A: we got one back here a while, A: I want to see WAR OF THE ROSES too, A: have you seen that? B: Oh yeah, B: boy I, I didn't like it. A: You didn't? B: No, B: it was, B: I didn't like the way it ended. A: I know, A: well the only reason I know why it ended is on ARSENIO HALL one night, Christopher Reeves told, that, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: I can't believe they killed them. A: Or, or who was it A: Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas. B: Might have been Michael Douglas. Oh, that starred in it. *listen A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: it was Michael Douglas. A: Christopher Reeve wasn't in it at all? B: Huh-uh. A: Okay. A: Well Arsenio Hall is the one that jumped up and said that I can't believe they killed them A: and Christopher Reeve, or, Mike Douglas went after his throat, you dummy A: So I know that they die, A: but I haven't told my husband. A: We've both been wanting to see it. B: It was, I, I, it was, it was weird. B: It was a different movie from anything I've ever seen. A: well we was, uh, teasing, about, you know, splitting our house down the middle B: Yeah A: They did that didn't they A: and they marked off routes that they could go or something B: Yeah, B: that would be kind of hard for us, B: we've only got one bathroom, B: I don't know A: We've got two bathrooms A: but, well A: actually, if he takes, A: my house kind of looks like two trailers put together. A: And one bathroom is at the end of one side A: and one's in the middle of the other, A: so we could do it. B: That wouldn't be too bad. A: No, A: and he could climb out the window A: and we, our whole house has, you know, A: every room leads to three rooms, A: so we can, you know B: Get around. A: yeah, A: you can get around A: You just can't go out the front door honey, A: sorry. B: Well did you see FATAL ATTRACTION? A: Yeah, A: that's coming back, on too B: I know it's going to be on, on the, on C B S Tuesday night B: an, and that's kind of what, in a way, you know, how it kind of bothered you, the way it ended and stuff. A: Uh-huh. B: That's kind of how WAR OF THE ROSES was. A: Huh, I, B: Parts of, parts of WAR OF THE ROSES was funny B: but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious, B: and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling, you know. A: Eerie feeling, A: or, I want to see it though. A: I'd like to see that and, uh, THE NEVER ENDING STORY, came out on Disney this month, I think. B: I I've heard about that A: I wanted to see that. B: but I don't know what it's about. A: THE NEVER ENDING STORY? B: Yeah. A: It's a child's movie, A: but, oh, it's good, A: I enjoyed it. B: I love Disney movies. A: Yeah, A: I do too Yeah, B: I mean, they're some of the best of, that are made. A: yeah. A: And, uh, well it's about this little boy who, uh, A: I think he's up in a attic, or some part of school. A: He got locked in the school A: and he got scared, A: but he starts dreaming A: and then, uh, he's saving the land of, uh, oh, A: it's been so long since I've seen it. A: All I know, all's I can really remember is him flying this great big dog, this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing, B: Oh A: it flies through the air. A: And he's trying to save the land from some, ooze A: But it's really good, A: I mean it sounds A: it, it had, uh, Fred Savage in it. A: No, A: no, A: no, A: no, A: no. A: Did you see that movie with Fred Savage in it, though, B: I don't think so. A: with, uh, oh, A: he had, uh, uh, A: oh it was THE PRINCESS BRIDE. B: Nope, B: I didn't see that. A: You didn't see that, A: that was cute, A: that was real, that was a good one. A: I, I like, I like slapstick comedy. B: So do I B: and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something B: and, and you're not sure whether it will be any good or not B: so sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than, A: Yeah, A: well I heard, A: a friend of mine told me she got NAKED GUN last night A: and she said that was hilarious. B: Yeah, B: now, we saw that, B: and and they're coming out with a sequel to it. A: Two and a half *is this a title?? B: It was funny. A: It A: yeah, A: I want to see that. A: She said she rented it last night A: and said it was real good A: an, B: And, and WORKING GIRL is really good. A: Now, I seen that, B: That was good. A: was that with that blonde, A: she pretended to be the boss or something. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I rented that one night by myself. A: I was home alone. A: Did you see HOME ALONE? B: Yes, B: I did, B: that, that just reminded me of that. B: Did you like it? B: There you go. B: First question, B: do you own your house? A: Uh, right, A: well, we try. A: I mean it's a big mortgage in the sky A: and someday, maybe, we might even own it, A: but, um, for all practical purposes, I guess we hold the mortgage B: Our name is on the till, A: Yeah, A: right. B: so that implies ownership. A: No one else has offered to pay for it. B: That's right. B: I would not object if anybody did. A: Yeah, A: really they could move right into the spare room B: Yeah. B: Well, we have, we have had this one for five years now. B: Before that we lived in Garland, uh, probably about, you know, four blocks away. A: Uh-huh. B: Liked the area, chose to stay inside of Spring Park. B: It's a, uh, B: I don't know if you have been up here, B: but it is a residential homeowners, association. A: Right, A: yeah, B: So, there's a lot of, you know, activities, a lot of pluses and common land. B: But, uh, we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market, you know, B: it could not possibly have gone any lower B: and so we were wrong A: Oh, five years ago. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, B: I think, B: what, B: it bottom out about a year later. A: Yeah, A: it, well, A: I mean just recently, I would say, I would give it two years back, when it was, I think, bottomed out. B: Oddly enough, two years, you know, B: I, uh, I think that, A: But, maybe not in your area, A: see, it was just different areas, B: not in, in, uh, this area. B: Cause this is about like the, A: That's a really nice area. B: Yeah. A: Besides, it's, you know, it's not, it's not Richardson. Is it? A: It's still considered Garland. B: No, B: it's, it's Richardson. A: Oh, ok, A: yeah. B: It's, Richardson B: and, hold on a second. B: to someone in Paul, I can hear you perfectly, perfectly well, B: I don't want to hear you. B: You are being rude. B: Whatever you ask or scream when I'm on the phone, the answer is no. B: Do you understand? B: to talking on How does that sound? A: There you go. A: Write that one down. B: Yeah, B: there I go. A: It sounded good to me B: Yeah, B: well, I hate to say how long that will last too. B: No, B: this area up here is, uh, all custom homes, B: and, it's, A: Right. B: I don't think that many by the builder that built this house. B: And, we were not the first people, the first owners, B: I think we are the third owners. A: Uh, okay. B: It was built by the architect for himself, who never moved into it. Who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep. A: Oh, no. B: Oh, yeah, B: caulking windows was a great mystery to them. A: Oh, gee. B: So, they just watched the water pour in on the carpet. B: But, it's a Sharif Myneer Homes, if that means anything, B: it did not really mean anything to me except, I liked it. A: I, I, kept thinking of Omar Sharif every time I saw that name somewhere, A: so, B: He builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now. B: I think he got out of the lower end market. And decided, A: Uh. B: but, the houses here in, in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred. A: Oh, wow. B: Yeah, B: well but, still I know that this one was built for two ninety nine, which is nowhere near what we paid for it. A: Right. B: And I think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot, heavily wooded off the golf course. A: Oh, great. B: Yeah, B: and the guy around the corner is being transferred B: so he said, uh, well, he did comparables that it's about eighty dollars, B: let's see what, B: I don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot off the creek and eighty on the creek, or, if it was eighty and a hundred. A: Well Yeah. A: Probably eighty. B: I think it was sixty, eighty. A: Sixty, eighty. B: I think. A: Well because, I know our, our little house over here stuck in the middle of, you know, the subdivision is, I think fifty five, A: so, I think the high end is definitely, you know somewhere there B: Well, try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot B: No, B: it could not be, B: because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet, B: and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars. A: Yeah. B: Just never. A: Well B: Now, maybe, you know, that's pretty close to what it would have sold for, uh, brand new, B: or that's pretty much what it was built for. B: It's got an awful lot of nice things in it B: but, you know, I don't think, I think it's going to be a long time, if ever, when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really, uh, desirable. B: It's seems like people go for square footage only now A: Yeah. B: and, uh, cause. Have you been back to the Perry Homes, back here? A: Um, the ones that look like brick houses B: The one that looks like Monopoly apartments. A: Right. A: Yeah, A: I think those are awful. A: I'm sorry, A: I just don't see the designer's, A: I just see him as trying to squish as much space, you know, as much house into the space as possible. B: They are huge when you are inside them. A: Yeah. B: They are very spacious. B: They are, you know, B: I was, I was in one today. B: It was forty two hundred square feet. A: Uh. B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: Well see that's, A: the house that we got is small enough so my husband and I, A: because there's just the two of us A: and the two cats, um, can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard. A: And we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know. B: See, when you have kids, you like to be able to, send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them. A: Yeah, A: that's true. B: But, I have been watching these houses go up B: and I, I don't, well, B: somebody was telling me, B: I know somebody who lives back there, B: I have always questioned the quality of construction B: and I, I don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house. A: Oh. B: When you watch them go up, you are just amazed that they do not fall over. A: Yeah. B: And it takes them something like, thirty days to complete a house. A: Oh, that's amazing. A: Right now, in fact, even as we speak, we are having a deck put on in back, A: and these guys are phenomenal. A: They just, they, they are doing such a terrific job back there, A: I mean, you know, you pay for it too, A: but it's, it's like, really worth it. A: They are putting in a deck, a redwood deck, B: Uh-huh. A: and it's just, they are doing such a fine, fine job. B: We have got three different levels of decking, because, this lot slopes way back down A: I'm really excited about it, A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, the house is built around the trees. A: Great. B: And with these decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up B: so, it's real, real shady. B: But, that's one of the few things that really, uh, immediately pays back on return. B: But, what I was going to tell you, these Perry Homes back there, A: Yeah. B: when the people from M C I come down B: and they are, you know, they are used to the Virginia area, metropolitan D C. A: Uh. B: My God, they come down here and those houses, that, that look the colonial look what the, A: Looks like the George Town brownstone B: Right, A: Yeah. B: And, uh, the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it, for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars, which is probably about what their equity is, that they got out of selling their house. A: Must be a dream. A: Yeah. B: Because those things are selling like hot cakes. B: But, one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill, per month, last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month. A: Oh. B: And I thought, A: I can't , B: and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here. B: And I was thinking, well, you know, I know why your God damn bill is so high, A: He has no insulation, probably. B: it's because there's not a there's no insulation, insulation in those things. A: Oh, my. B: Yeah. A: Gosh. A: What a trap. Huh. B: Any yet, you know, B: they, they show very well they show very well unless you have, you know, lived in a lot of houses around the area, or looked at a lot of houses around here. A: And you ask the right questions and can research, A: yeah. A: Yeah. B: And I think that makes a big difference. B: But, I like, I like this area B: and everything that I have been saying, says that it's, A: Oh, I do too. B: I think if we had to sell now, we could come close to breaking even A: But, still, um, it's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that B: You're in, you're in the, A: Yes, um, A: I, I think that Plano has really done a fantastic job. A: I mean, at least their plans have, are good. A: Um, however, I was, A: maybe you saw in the paper this morning that, um, they've had some problems with, the recycling on plastic, B: With the plastic. A: uh-huh. A: I thought that was most interesting. B: Well, I just, I thought it was sad that they, it started out as a good program. *two utts? But then people started dumping trash. and the wrong objects in there, A: Yeah. A: Yes. B: and I, and that concerned me, that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the dump, A: Yeah. A: That's right. B: and, and, uh, I, it's too bad that people have to ruin, a good part thing. A: Yeah. A: I guess that's going to happen. A: Yeah, A: a really good effort, A: that's right, A: yeah. B: But, uh, A: Well, I was thinking about the other day, um, when I, when Dick and I were, oh, many, many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in Missouri, um, I went, oh, A: I was probably, this was probably, A: see, it have been like nineteen sixty-seven or sixty-eight, um, A: we, I went to a meeting, A: and, uh, one of the, the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling A: and, um, she was from Saint Louis, B: Um. A: and she had this fantastic, um, family effort in, in recycling, A: and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics, and her aluminum, B: Oh. A: and I thought wow, I mean, how, one person is doing that, you know, A: but my, my thought was it's a shame, A: I mean, it's wonderful that she's doing it and it, A: but wouldn't it be much nicer if we all did it, A: because her effort would have really, um, really, uh, been a good example for all of us. A: And yet, you know, and we were just sort of talking about it at the time. A: And here we are, you know, A: now we're doing it on a, city wide basis in, in communities. B: Doing it A: So it's wonderful that we've come that far, I think A: but, *slash error Um. B: What did she do with, B: if, if she, B: was she like a group that was doing it, B: or was she doing it on her own, B: and, what did she do with the, A: I think she was, A: I was trying to remember, A: it seems to me that she was doing it on her own, and living in Saint Louis, A: there were places where she could actually take her, uh, things herself, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: and so it wasn't, you know, something that was being picked up A: or, um, and I think she was encouraging other people to do it if they A: and very often the artist will have a an album A: and, so if you like the artist, you buy the album. B: Yeah. A: So you definitely get to try before you buy. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: that's definitely B: I, A: You know, it, A: you, you, you don't always quite get it right, A: Okay. B: Okay, B: you go first. A: Well, I have, uh, two kids, A: I have one seven and one five B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, they're in a public school here in Tyler A: and, uh, I'm happy with it. B: Uh-huh. A: I'm happy with the school, A: it's great, A: good teachers A: good curriculum, uh, A: they learn a lot, A: they have no problems, uh, A: but I do live in the better, well, in the best part of the city, A: though, I live in, you know, the real richy part, I guess. A: I'm not, A: but, everybody around me is A: and, uh, but they're, A: I have friends that live in the other, the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town A: and their schools are kind of rundown and, uh, older A: and they don't really offer as much, I don't know, as, uh, the school that my girls are in. A: I don't really think that's fair. You know. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, but, you know, I'm happy with what they're in, A: so, go ahead B: Well, yeah, B: it, it's, it's pretty much what I was going to say B: is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I grew up in New York B: and uh, the place, A: Wow. B: or not New York City, upstate New York A: Uh-huh. B: and I went to, uh, the City of Rochester School District A: Uh-huh. B: and a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs B: and it wasn't, we weren't too far removed geographically from each other, B: but the difference in schools I think was pretty substantial A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, one of the things that probably would have been better if, is if the entire county had had, had just one school system. A: Right. B: And that would result in some, uh, could result in more equitable distribution of money B: because what was happening was, you know, all the very rich people went out to the, move out to the suburbs B: and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with. A: Uh-huh. B: As a result, the schools were rundown, B: there wasn't as many, you know, of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked. B: There wasn't as many advanced placement courses, uh, when I was a senior that some other schools had. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it, it, B: so I, you know, I think that one of the things, one of the ways to, to, to help schools in general, uh, and get them all to a minimum level of, of, of competency almost, would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people, B: and the, the problem with that is then, then, then people will either, the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or they'll move farther away to get better schools. A: Yeah. A: Right B: So, you know it, it's kind of, you end up chasing, like a dog chasing its own tail sort of. A: Also, uh, the, the family environment, A: you know, you can come to south Tyler where I live A: and you have got room mothers in every room, A: you've got art mothers, A: you've got every, every holiday, A: there's parties. A: All these kids have these really supportive, really supportive parents, always up there for something. B: Yeah. A: You can go to north Tyler to the schools A: and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is. You know, B: Uh-huh. A: uh, that has a, a whole lot to do with it, you know, A: as far as their learning, I mean, if the parents aren't, uh, you know, willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning you know, they really don't have much of a chance at all. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: Why is that? A: Huh? B: Why is that? A: Why A: You they just don't, A: I mean, I mean, I'm, I'm up there at my kids' school, A: I know what they're learning A: and if they're up, I call and find out, you know, A: is she having problems, A: does she need help with anything, A: no, A: she's doing fine, A: okay, you know, uh, A: and I, I know kids that their parents could really give a rip A: and the kids are not motivated. B: Right. B: Right. A: They have no motivation from home, A: so they just go to school A: and, you know, you know, I'll get through the day, and, uh, bring homework home A: and, there's nobody to, to sit them down and say, you're going to do this. B: Right. A: Uh, just, you know, they, they take a notion to do it, A: they do, A: and, uh, that doesn't work either, you know, A: they have to have guidance A: and uh, they can't just have it at school and then come home B: Uh-huh. A: and there's nothing, you know. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Yeah, B: I know that that, that was a big factor for me. B: I ended up coming out of, of the public school system very well and was very good education, uh, A: Uh-huh. B: ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been, you know, which is really nice, A: Uh-huh. B: and I think the difference for me was that my parents were, you know, they were definitely, they were always there, A: Yeah. B: was, like, well, B: yeah, B: of course you're going to study and do well B: and that's the way, B: of course, are you, A: The last auto repair I had was A: I have a nineteen eighty-four Nissan truck A: I had a tune up done A: and I had, I had the brakes done on it A: and then, the reason I did that was because I don't have a scope A: and it has eight spark plugs A: and it's hard to, to get get at them A: and plus the time on them. A: I just don't have time any more. A: Uh, as far as maintenance tasks that I do myself, I, I usually change the oil and wash the air filter A: and I, I had an occasion to change, to have to change the battery once, A: but, the brakes, I was really surprised that the brakes A: I wanted, A: I do have the background. A: I know what needs to be done A: and I know that the oil needs, should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings A: and the lube, lubrication system needs to be lubricated and A: so I, I stay on top of that A: but I I wanted my front wheels, A: I wanted the bearings packed A: and they wanted something like fifteen dollars, uh, a front or something like that A: or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it B: Just to pack the bearings? A: just to pack the bearings, A: but what I found is that they had a brake job A: and they, A: I had them, A: the other thing I let them do some times is that I let them go through and let them tell me what, let them do the diagnostics. A: That's free, A: okay. A: And then I can decide whether I want them to do it or whether I can do it, see. B: Right. A: And they told me that my, my brake pads were gosh, you know, seventy percent still good, you know, A: but still it was cheaper in the long run A: and uh, A: so I just got the the brakes done A: and I thought that was a good deal. A: And plus B: Right. B: And they repacked the wheel bearings. A: and they repacked the the wheel bearings. A: Yeah A: but, uh, I've, I've had considerable experience. A: I'm, you might say I'm, uh, uh, good back yard mechanic A: and I, you know, I took auto shop in high school, A: it's been a while back, A: but I, I still have a pretty good feel for it, A: but one thing I didn't know is that when I was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars, A: I, I had bigger cars A: and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those A: and what I was surprised at is that on my little Nissan I bought the truck with about sixty thousand, I have almost one hundred and ten, A: so I drove on those brake pads for, uh, you know, forty-five thousand miles A: and there was hardly any wear to them. A: So those small little trucks and cars like that, they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good. Exactly, B: You know, they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much B: and the the surface materials on the pads is so good. A: so I, you know, I just did it anyway. A: I like to, I like to stay up on it. A: You know, like I just kind of stay up on it A: and then if you go and like, just about any point, any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil, the oil is you might say, uh, a white golden brown. A: You know, it's not dirty. A: I, I, I keep it that way because that's, that is the key to the longevity. B: Right. B: Well it sounds like you've had some good experiences with that A: So, so how, A: Uh-huh. B: uh, and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that. A: Oh, A: oh. B: Uh, I, I get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car B: and, uh and in fact I have an eighty-seven Mustang with a three O two in it that I've, uh, beefed up a little bit A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Okay. B: and one of the things that I did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels A: Uh-huh B: uh, the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that I put on it were, uh, not even cast aluminum. B: They were just pressed aluminum. A: You're talking about the vibration dampener? B: Well, there's three, there's three pulleys that you change. B: You change the crank pulley the alternator pulley and, uh, the water pump pulley. A: That's the vibration dampener, A: yeah. A: Okay. B: So, when I changed those over, I put on these, these pressed aluminum things A: Um. B: and, uh, probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out. A: Uh, oh. B: So in the process of seizing, the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way. But not far enough to notice. A: Um. A: Uh, oh. A: Huh. B: So, I was on my way to work one day B: and, uh, the water pump pulley split laterally in half. B: So there was half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump B: and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank A: Uh-huh. B: and uh, I, A: So, the, the topic is hobbies B: In your spare time. A: Yeah. A: Who has spare time A: Um, I don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that. A: I used to. I used to do, like salt ornaments and things. B: Uh-huh. A: But that was, oh, good many, many years ago A: and I have, I really, my spare time B: Yeah. A: I usually go do aerobics and read, A: and that's, about it B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: I understood that. B: I'm, you know, I work full time B: and I have two kids B: so my spare time usually involves something with the kids. A: Yeah. B: You know, hobbies, B: we, I, I can't really say that we have hobbies. B: It's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend. B: You know, we like to go out go out, A: Yeah, A: family. A: Well, well, that's what I meant by salt that we, we did that like as a family, little ornaments and, things like that, and just kind of really got into it. Like during the Christmas season, making them up for other people and things like that. B: Oh. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: But as far as, B: Uh-huh. A: I've just never been very skilled at, far, you know, needle, work B: Uh-huh. A: And the things I've tried to do just don't look very good A: and, B: I, I guess mostly as far as, as crafts go, I've done, um, some needlepoint. B: I've done mostly cross stitching. B: I used to, uh, do like, um, B: one that I did for both kids are like, oh, B: they're plaques with, you know, different kind of animals B: and then you have their birth date on them, A: Yeah. B: and then you have a little picture of them B: and you frame them and stuff, A: Uh-huh. B: but nothing steady. B: Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it, B: but, you know, it's nothing that I, can really, A: It's not, like you sit and knit every night B: No. B: Not at all. A: Yeah. A: I don't even know how to knit A: and my mother used to knit, you know, all the time B: Uh-huh. A: and, and I don't even know how to knit A: I'm like, that's a lost art from this family B: Yeah. A: So, um, A: but, it's not a very good topic A: it feels like, if, you know, B: No. A: not when you're A: neither one of us are really, A: I, I have seen things I really like, you know, that were done, especially like needlepoint. B: Uh-huh. A: Needlepoint, cushions and things. B: Yeah. A: But, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it, you know, and, and that the petty point and things like that. B: Yeah. A: It's like, God, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made B: I don't know what, what, is, B: it's like there, B: but here a lot of the country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling. A: Yeah. B: And, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff B: and there's just tons of stuff everywhere B: and, you know, people just do it in their garage A: Yeah. B: and then on weekends they go out and sell it B: and during the week they go back and do some more. A: And see, they do that as their job. Whereas, you know, for us it, B: Right A: and they make it cheaper for us to buy B: Yeah B: Definitely. A: So, A: but, and, I mean, I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that A: because I can remember when I used to do, you know, those little salt, those figurines and things. A: It was, it was relaxing, you know, creative, A: you felt very creative. B: Uh-huh. A: But, it just was so time, time, involved, you know, so much time involved and the different steps and things. B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: So, A: and, B: Okay B: Well, I think, I think we're okay. B: I think we did five minutes, B: so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore A: Yeah. A: So, B: Okay. B: Well, thank you. A: Okay. A: I hope you have a good rest of your weekend. B: Thanks. B: Bye-bye. A: Okay. A: Bye-bye. B: Where are you from Tina? A: Um, I'm from Maryland A: and, um, I have one son who's almost sixteen months old. A: Are, are you married, or ... B: Yeah, B: uh-huh. A: You are. B: I have, I have two children, B: I have a seven year old and a three year old. A: Oh. B: And, uh, so I try to spend as much time as possible with them. A: That's good. A: Uh, what kind of things do you do? B: Well, um, we do a lot of things with them, you know, B: Taylor my youngest is, B: or my oldest is in school B: and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that. A: Oh. B: was it a big change in your life, to, uh have a child. A: Oh yeah A: Um, yeah, A: it's really nice, uh, A: my husband, uh, is working you know, most of the time. A: He's working long hours, A: but, uh, I'm staying home. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, I'm just working a couple days a month, A: and, um ... B: Oh, uh-huh. B: What do you do during those, those days? A: Um, we spend a lot of time at the playground A: and we go to the zoo, A: and we go A: and we ... B: Well you said, you said you worked a couple days a month, though, A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: what do, what do you do? A: I'm a nurse. B: Oh, are you? A: So, yeah, A: so it's, it's, it's real easy to work out my schedule, you know, to, uh, get in, to, to still stay in with that, an, and to have enough time to spend with Matthew. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: He, he's, uh, just now really starting to, to get interested in a lot of things, A: so, um, B: Yeah, B: I understand that, B: yeah. B: They really grow up quick. Especially at that early age. A: Yeah B: But my, my wife was, uh, B: she worked part-time when my oldest was, was little B: and now she's staying home all the time, B: but, uh, that worked out really well because it's a big transition I think to have children. A: Oh, yeah. B: You know, to go from, you know, nothing, you know, B: if you want to do something every night that's fine, B: but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore, B: so. A: That's right, A: and I think a lot of people are, um, are turning to, well, I think, I think a lot of people are realizing that A: but still there are so many people that are, you know, have their careers first A: and, it's, uh, I think it's really hurting, uh, the kids, you know, B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: but. B: Yeah, B: I agree with you, B: I, I, I think that my wife leaned that way B: and I'm really glad she did B: and, you know, I'm glad she's staying home, B: but, you know, I know there are some days when she she wishes she was back at work. A: I know, A: That's why I like to to, to work a couple days, A: I think it's, uh, it gives me a break. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: well see that's, that's why I'm glad my wife did too, B: 'cause she worked either two to three days a week B: and that got her out of the house B: and yet she'd get to spend, you know, three or four days with ... A: Most of the time at home, A: yeah. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: and so. A: Uh, we had started out like that A: and, um, I think that was really ideal, uh. B: Yeah, B: I do to, B: I agree, B: but then when you start having two of them, it's, you know, a little bit tougher, because you've got to make a little more money, to make that payoff and stuff. A: It's, A: yeah. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: it's difficult, A: but. B: Are, are you from the Maryland area? A: Uh-huh, A: I'm, I've, I've lived here forever, A: so. B: Really. A: Yeah, A: I I live in Germantown, A: and, uh. A: Are you, where are you from? B: Um, uh, I'm in Dallas, Texas. A: In Dallas, A: oh. B: Yeah, B: so, uh, I'm, I've lived here like eight years or so, B: my wife's from Fort Worth. A: Oh, yea-,. B: But, B: yeah, B: I work for Texas Instruments. A: Okay, A: oh, A: so that explains. B: Yeah, B: that explains it doesn't it. A: Well, um, I don't know, A: I, uh, we, we do a lot of things on the weekends together, the family, B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: but, uh, as far as during the week, it's, it's usually, uh, you know, just my son and I, A: and we're ... B: Yeah, B: what's your husband do? A: Uh, he, he works for Coca Cola. B: Uh-huh. A: So he, uh, he manages a plant out here, B: Oh. A: an, and it takes a lot of time. B: Oh, yeah, B: I'm sure it does. A: But, um, it, you know, A: we take walks, and go to the library, and try to fill our day with things like that, B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: but, um. B: Yeah, B: what, uh, B: my wife did some teaching at like, uh, like a private tutoring place. A Sylvan Learning Center this year A: Oh. B: and so that, that got me to to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff, you know, 'cause normally if, if they need something they just go to mom. No matter what it is, A: Oh. A: Yeah B: I mean, I I'm perfectly capable of doing it for them, B: but, it's so much easier to go to mom, A: Right. B: I guess they get used to it. B: So, B: but, you know, we'd go to the library and do things like that, B: yeah, B: but A: That's good, A: that's good. A: I know my husband was real, uh, A: in the beginning when he, uh, he was transferred to a, a larger plant A: and he, uh, he works about an hour and a half away from here, from our home, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, so it takes him a little bit of time. B: Oh, yeah. A: And I'm not able to work during the week, uh, because of that. A: He was, I was working in the evening, B: Uh-huh. A: and he was coming home A: and I, I could go to work, A: but, uh, their relationship, uh, when I was able to work in the evenings, uh, really grew. B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: He, you know, A: just the time that they were spending together, B: Yeah. A: I think it, it really, it really helped to have that time together. B: Uh-huh, B: it really does B: because I think you know, you grow closer. B: Was your, uh, was your husband, I mean naturally a child, B: I mean had he been around children, B: or ... A: Uh, oh yeah, A: he has, uh, he has seven other brothers and sisters, B: Oh. A: and they have, we have thirteen grand, A: well his parents have thirteen grandchildren. B: Uh-huh. A: So it's, uh, you know, there's a lot of kids in the family A: and, and he really enjoys it. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: But, uh, right now it's kind of a difficult time, A: but ... B: Yeah. A: And, and the cost of living here is just so tremendously, you know, outrageous B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: Um, it's difficult, uh, to do it any other way. B: Yeah, B: I understand. A: Yeah. B: I'm, I, you know B: it's, it's hard because, you know, B: then you're not getting to spend as much time with, at home, B: I mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to. A: That's right. B: So, yeah, B: that that's a tough situation, B: but then, then again, you know, some, B: you got to do what you got to do, you know to get along, too, A: Yeah. B: so. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: at least, I, I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home A: It, uh, B: Uh-huh, B: well like I said my wife normally feels that way, B: there are days when, uh, I come home and she says here take these kids, B: I'm getting out. A: I know B: So she's, she's had about enough during those days, B: but. But, for the most part, I, you know, I've really feel like that's led, A: I know. B: the way that, you know, B: like what you said with the cost of living and everything, I think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an and won't. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: And so I think that's tended to lead to a decline in, in families and family values especially. A: Oh yeah, A: it has. B: And I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that, you know, we need to do something about, B: but I don't know what. A: I believe that too, A: and I think, uh, the kids are where they need to, you know, B: Yeah. A: they need to really focus on the children in the in this country. B: Yeah. B: Would, would you have said that a couple of years ago, do you think? A: No, A: I didn't, I didn't even really think about it that much, I mean, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: I, I was aware, vaguely aware of it, A: but, um, I didn't it wasn't really that important to me, A: and, uh, ... B: Uh-huh, B: it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child. A: Oh, it, it really does, A: I, A: just the whole, uh, you know, A: seeing how you really are are, are forming this, you know, the mind B: Uh-huh. B: Well, you know, in the next year or so, you'll see so many instances where, you know, he'll mimic something that you've done, B: and you see, you know, everything I'm doing, he's learning from. A: That's right. B: And, and, you think, if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a baby-sitter or from a day care. A: Yeah. B: You know, that's how they're developing their patterns. B: And I think a lot of people either, don't care, or don't realize it, you know. B: That's, A: Or, or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide. B: Yeah. A: I, I've seen a lot of people just say well, you know, he'll learn everything when he gets into, uh, you know, B: Yeah B: eventually. B: Yeah, B: it's true. A: but it, um, A: I, I know, A: even just this first year, that I've been with, uh, my son, here, um, he's, A: I can just see how much, of, of a difference it makes staying home with him, instead of, uh, B: Uh-huh, B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: plus, plus I think it becomes part of part of you too, B: I mean, you get to stay home, B: I mean it's not just for him, B: but it's also for you, because you're both kind of bonding together there too, I think, B: so. A: Yeah, A: that's true. B: Well it's been nice talking to you. A: Well it's nice talking to you, too. B: Okay B: good luck. A: Okay. B: Okay, B: good-bye. B: Lynn, do you, do you want to start? A: Certainly. B: Okay. A: Um, B: Do you want to tell me about vacations you've taken B: or, A: Well, I, I tend to, uh, take two kinds of vacations, the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sight-seeing and things like that. B: Uh-huh. B: Which is your favorite? A: Oh, well, I couldn't live without the family vacations, A: but, uh, my favorite is the, the indulgent ones, where we go off and, and, uh, see places that have interested me since I was a kid, for the most part. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, B: Your family doesn't live close, then? A: Uh, not anymore. A: They, uh, they've been in San Diego for the last few years, A: and they're moving to Florida. B: Okay. A: And that's one of those things, A: you just have to go once a year. B: Yep, B: I understand. A: So, uh, basically it, it sorts out into that, A: and then once, about once every three or four years I try to get over to England, because I lived there for a while, some years back. B: Wow. B: I've only been there once. A: Oh. B: and I'd love to go back. A: Beautiful country. A: Beautiful country, B: And it was, A: beautiful people. B: Yeah, B: it, A: But, uh, A: and I'd real, really like to go because, um, I'm fairly recently married B: we had a great time. A: and, and my husband has been hearing about these people for years A: and, uh, but he's never met them, A: so, uh, I'd like, I'd like to do that. A: But anyway, that's, that's our typical vacation, A: and, uh, we enjoy the family vacations, A: but the other ones are very special getaways, A: and we probably take one of each every year. A: How about yourself? B: Well, uh, we, we, as you do, take family vacations, uh, sometimes one a year, B: and, but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons. B: But vacations we really enjoy, B: I think we've been on three cruises. A: Oh, I've never, been on a cruise. B: And we, we really love cruises. B: We've gone on CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, we've gone fairly inexpensive from, as most cruises go. B: Uh, we usually book just a month before it's ready to go. A: Yeah. B: And we get upgraded. B: Last last two times, in fact, we had an outside room B: and it was beautiful. A: Um. B: And we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around. B: It's kind of, A: Well, what do you do on a cruise? A: I've never been on a cruise. B: Oh, my God, you do everything. B: You, I mean, you can be as busy as you want to be, or as laid back as you want to be. B: You can sit in the sun all day around the pool, B: or you can take part in the games that they have going on. B: They always have bingo. B: They have a casino. B: Uh, they have a massage parlor. B: They have exercise, B: I mean, you can do anything. A: Huh. B: And that's just aboard ship. B: And then when the ship docks, you get to go sight-seeing and shopping. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's quite fun. A: Uh-huh. A: And where have you been on these cruises? B: Uh, Nassau, San Juan, Saint Thomas. B: We've been there twice. B: We went two cruises that hit those islands, but with different people. B: We, we've gone with friends each time. A: I see. B: And then we went to, uh, the western Caribbean, which is, uh, Port, uh, Cancun, Cozumel, and Ocho Rios. A: Oh, the, the Mexican coast. B: Pardon me? A: That's all Mexico, I think. B: Yes, B: uh-huh. B: And, but it was wonderful. B: So we really like those. B: And, uh, I guess we just like to go someplace, someplace entirely different. B: We've been to a few places in this country. B: We still have a lot to see, though. A: Where are you from originally? B: We're from Illinois originally. A: Uh-huh. B: And we've been down in Texas eighteen years, B: and so, like you, we always try to make it, you know, back home to see the relatives. B: We both still have family there. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's fun. B: It brings back a lot of memories. A: Oh, yes. B: Uh, things are different there, though. B: They're, uh, B: I don't know. B: It's just entirely different world than this A: Well, I, I grew up in Dallas, A: so I mean, it's not, it's not like I'm going home. B: Did you? A: My, my parents retired first to San Diego, B: Uh-huh. A: and they're going now to Florida, A: and so they're going very nice places, A: thank God, B: Uh-huh. A: that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know. A: I really came to love San Diego and feel very, comfortable there. A: They've been there eight years. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, you know, I just grab the car and drive everywhere. B: Oh, that's great. A: So it, it is, it is nice, A: but it's not home. A: This is home, A: and, um, and I've never thought about a cruise. A: It's so funny. B: Oh, they, they, they really are. B: We've, yeah, as I said, we've done them three times. B: We'd be going again this, this year if circumstances hadn't changed. B: We, we'd probably go. A: Uh-huh. B: My husband would, you know, B: the minute I said the word, he, he, he's chomping at the bit. B: He kind of likes the casinos a little bit. A: Uh-huh. B: But I like all of that. A: What's the best part, from your point of view? B: I like seeing other countries and shopping in other places. A: Uh-huh. B: I like shopping. B: I can shop anyplace, shop in London and France and wherever. B: Now, my kids are moving to Toronto, B: so we're going to be able to go up there. A: Oh, that will be nice. B: So I'm kind of looking forward to that, except I hate to see them go. A: Oh, sure. B: But, A: Sure. A: Well, go in, don't go in the winter. B: Oh, that's what everybody says, B: and I, I think it's, B: I think I'll try to stay away, except my, my second grandchild will be born in in the winter in January. A: Oh. B: So that will be hard to stay away from. A: Well, there are exceptions made for special occasions like that. B: Yeah. A: But the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer A: so, B: Isn't that the truth, B: uh-huh. A: Huh. Well, that sounds wonderful. A: I, I guess I, I would contemplate going on a cruise, uh, oh, all circumstances permitting it. B: Well, there's all age groups too, B: and that's, that's kind of fun. B: Uh, you, if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals, you meet different people. A: Uh-huh. B: You may meet people, you know, thirty years older than you, or younger, B: and everybody is really interesting, B: and everybody is there to have a good time B: and, A: Huh. How long are the cruises? B: Uh, we've only gone on the seven day cruises. A: Uh-huh. B: They have shorter ones B: and then they have ten day ones. B: But I think seven days is long enough for us. B: By that time we're ready to get home and get back to our routine. A: Yeah. B: I think most vacations, uh, seven days is enough for us. B: We've gone, B: I think when we went to England and France, we were there ten, twelve days, B: and that was pushing it a bit. A: Yeah. A: Uh, I tend, when, when I spend enough money to go overseas A: I, go for a long time. B: Yeah. B: Well, that, that makes sense, it really does. B: I mean, oh, we went to Panama too. A: Oh, that's interesting. B: Went to Panama last August. A: Uh-huh. B: Our son-in-law is from Panama. A: Oh. B: And, uh, we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents, who live there. A: Uh-huh. B: And his father is a, a doctor B: and his mother is a kindergarten teacher, B: and they took time off, B: it was their winter B: and they were having a little break, B: so they took some time off that, uh, they could show us around. B: And it, it is a beautiful country. A: Huh. B: It is beautiful. B: They have mountains. B: We were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore. A: That's really nice. B: And it, it is gorgeous. B: They live in a small town called David, which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it's, it's just, it's just a gorgeous country. B: Most people don't realize it. B: I think if they could get tourists coming to their country, they'd improve the economy considerably. A: Huh. Well, may, maybe now things are calming down again. That will happen. B: Yeah. B: We really hope, hope so. A: Well, that, that's really great. Uh, B: Yeah. A: I, I mean, as I said, basically all I've done is go back and forth to parents A: and, uh, B: Well, that, that's, that's pretty good. B: That's pretty good. A: And, and, uh, we had, my husband had a conference in L A, A: so we spent a week in L A A: and of course, B: Oh, do you like L A? A: Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm very unusual. A: I like, B: You ready? A: Yeah. B: Okay. B: What have you seen lately? A: Well, uh, it's funny, when I tried, to make the call the other days, A: I thought, A: I hadn't seen anything since DANCES WITH WOLVES A: but today I went to see REGARDING WITH HENRY. B: Oh, I'm dying to see that. A: It was really good. A: We B: Oh. A: uh, Jeff Wariner just got out of the hospital B: Uh-huh A: and, uh, Jeff and Deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood, A: and, uh, we all liked it. A: We had both moms and, uh, fifteen year olds and a twelve year old A: and everyone enjoyed it. B: Oh, my goodness. A: And, uh, B: Oh, well I am just dying to see it. B: I went to dinner with some friends last weekend B: and they said get a baby-sitter B: and we'll all go see REGARDING HENRY A: Yeah. B: and I said, ooh, I want to see it so bad. A: Well, my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer, on, choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another. A lot of the ones I had wanted to see B: Oh. A: and so since he had this friend up from Houston, uh, and his friend had already seen so many and I thought they decided on this and I thought well, I want to see this one, too. A: So, we, uh, I B: Yeah. A: finally, it's my first summer movie B: Oh my. B: Well, let me see. B: Was it, B: well, we went to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS last weekend B: and that may be, B: no, B: right before I went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on, B: we're going to the movies. B: And we won't, B: well she goes all the time B: but I go maybe once every couple of months. A: Yeah. B: And when I go, I go see two at a time. B: So we went to see SOAPDISH, B: and A: Oh, was that good? A: Cause, B: Oh, hysterical. B: We laughed so hard, B: it was just, you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard. A: Yeah. A: Well, I want to see that and CITY SLICKERS both. A: I love comedies. B: Yeah A: But, that's what I was B: that's the other one that we went to that night. A: Oh, was it? B: And, my face hurt so bad, from laughing because I love Billy Crystal. A: Oh B: And course, growing up on, on the back of a horse, you know, and being on ranches and stuff, so much of that was so true B: and I was absolutely rolling in the aisles. B: It was so funny. B: Both of them were great. A: Oh, well good. A: I'm, I'm glad to hear that because they, B: Oh, they are, are B: we just laughed so hard. B: And like I said, with CITY I mean with SOAPDISH, it is so cornball B: and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know. A: Uh-huh B: Just, they just carried it off, to the tee. A: Well, I don't, I don't know if you got to see WEEKEND, um, AT BERNIE'S that was out a couple of years ago. B: No. A: They had a free showing at the Berkeley, um, United Artist. B: How neat. A: And, I don't know who was here or whether Jay called a friend A: and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in A: but we thought we'd try it, you know, free movie. B: Shoot, B: yeah. A: It was so funny and it sounds like, uh, what you were just describing, SOAPDISH, too. A: I mean, we just, we hurt by the time we came out. B: Oh yeah. A: And the whole theater was hysterical A: and it's just, it's just goofy. A: I mean, it's, uh, A: if you have a chance to rent it, at least, A: or it should be out on T V, I would think, B: Yeah, B: I think it is. B: I think it is. A: Um, cause it's, it's just a fun summer light comedy, A: make your cheeks hurt laughing. A: Especially in the theater it was contagious, you know B: Yeah. A: I, I imagine the way SOAPDISH was, but, with everyone laughing. B: Oh gosh B: I never laughed. B: And people were just screaming and applauding B: and, you know, it was just hysterical. A: Well, I'm glad you did that before your surgery B: Oh, me too, because I don't even know if I could live through it now. A: Yeah B: I mean I'm getting around real good B: and I'm just still real sore. A: Yeah. B: And today I was, I, course I went back to work two weeks after, uh A: Oh, gosh. B: but see I don't have permanent work. B: I, right now I'm working with a temporary agency. B: And so, the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free. A: Oh. B: Oh, so I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants, B: and I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed. A: Yeah. B: And then they called me to see if I wanted to work a day. B: And I said, yeah, B: and I went B: and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that. B: And, uh, I worked about three days a week ever since, two to three days a week. B: And so I went to my doctors last Thursday, B: and this was my fourth week checkup B: and he said well gosh, you're just healing really well, B: I just can't get over this. B: He says, in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things. B: If you want to play ball, you can go play ball. B: He says, now I'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball B: but you can if you want to. A: Yeah B: And, uh, you know, he was teasing me B: and he says, yeah, B: you'll be out there waterskiing, B: I can just see it now. B: And, uh, he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks. B: You've only got two more weeks. B: I said okay fine, I, I will, I will B: Whatever you call easy, I'll do it, you know. B: But and I've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it. A: Yeah. A: Yeah B: And so, I don't, I'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when I was, when I'm still sort of on the sore side. A: Yeah B: But, B: well, what's your next, B: have you seen ROBIN HOOD yet? A: No, A: that was one, uh, Jay got to see with a friend A: and so I B: Uh. A: and to try and, uh, try and find time it's hard, uh, with Jim's schedule, too, just to get a time that we can both go. B: Oh yeah. A: And, uh, I'm holding out for CITY SLICKERS for the two of us because, uh, we had friends that went to see that and said, you know, it's just perfect for our age group B: Uh-huh. A: and because I think he, he needs a comedy, too. A: Uh, and that's what he would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY, too, A: but knew that, uh, A: we've, we've got a lot of company this summer, which is wonderful. A: We're really enjoying it A: but some of the different things we're doing, uh there's just not a time, enough time to do it all B: Uh-huh. A: and he said, well, realistically You know, he knew he couldn't get them all in. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, Jay really liked ROBIN HOOD. A: Um, when the choir group went to see BACKDRAFT and they thought that was, uh, it was funny cause he sounded like the critics. A: He said, you know the plot line and the characters, uh, you know aren't real big A: but the, the fire scenes and the you know that action part is fantastic. B: Uh-huh. A: But, he thought ROBIN HOOD was great. A: It was real different then you'd expect, A: but but he enjoyed it B: Oh really? A: and so, B: Well I went, B: course I am a Kevin Costner fan. A: Yeah, A: me too. A: And yeah, B: Supreme. A: I really, uh, like him a lot. Which is why, DANCES WITH WOLVES was the last movie we had seen for several months B: Uh-huh. A: but, B: Gosh, was that wonderful. A: It was, A: I, uh, A: in fact, uh, a friend from Germany was visiting in March A: and we wanted, we didn't, ran out of time, we wanted to take him to see it. A: We were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it, too. B: Oh, yeah. A: Uh, I just thought that was terrific. A: And I really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons I wanted to see, B: I do, too. B: I think he's really good. A: And he's very good in REGARDING HENRY. A: That's not an easy part to play, I, I don't think B: I wouldn't think. B: Well, my kids are going to their Dad's tomorrow night B: so I sort of think I may go do that. A: Yeah. A: That's at, that one won't your sides B: Good A: Um, it, A: was this the first time you got to see ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS? A: Or, B: I B: my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age begin to A: Uh-huh. B: And we went to the, A: my number. A: Okay. B: Okay. B: So are you a, a, a golfer B: or are you a spectator? A: Oh, I'm a, A: I play golf A: but I don't actually play golf. B: Well, I'm the same way. B: I, I go out there and hit the ball. A: Yeah. A: Hack it all over the place? B: Yeah. A: It's sickening, isn't it? B: Um, uh, well, in the Carolinas it's, it's just, you know, we've got a bunch of golf courses around here. A: Yeah. A: We've got tons up here A: but I don't know. A: How do you feel about your game? A: I guess that's a good question? B: Uh, well, I mean I'm not a serious golfer at all, B: uh, uh, a friend of mine goes golfing a lot B: and he drags me out every now and then B: and I, uh, I don't have a, I don't really even have a game. B: I usually B: when I go out and play golf it's usually like at a, at one of these par threes that, you know, you, A: Yeah. B: but, um, I like watching it on T V. A: Yeah, A: I like that too. A: I don't know A: I try to play, A: but God, I, a couple years ago I played two, three times a week and got lousy. A: I guess that's the best I ever got was lousy. A: And I thought I was really improving and the big break was going to come A: and then I got worse again A: so. B: get they, they say I hit worm burners because I, I can't hit it up in the air. A: Yeah. B: So I'm pretty bad B: but I, I, I get great distance hitting it, you know, across the ground, B: and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because I'm, B: but I'm getting better. B: I've got where now I can hit it in, in the air some of the time. A: That's pretty good. B: Yeah. B: Uh, so I'm kind of a novice at it. A: Um, I'm that and worse. A: I, I play A: next year I, A: actually I take it kind of seriously A: but I've been doing so bad. A: Next year, I always say this every year, but next year I'm starting over from scratch. A: I'm going to go take lessons and everything. A: I'm going to do it right, and see if I can actually play this game or not. B: Well, that I, I guess that's what I need to do is, is get some kind of lessons or something. B: Because I, my, my tee off is not bad, B: I mean I'm, I'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that B: it's just, that, that initial tee A: Yeah, A: what do you do when you're putting? A: That's a good thing. A: That's something I could learn actually. A: That's when I do my worst. A: I finally get to the green A: and I think I'm doing all, all fine A: and then, B: Just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really, B: you know, checking the ground and, and so forth, you know. A: Yeah. B: See how it's going to break or whatever. A: Can you really see it though? B: Yeah. A: What about the speed? B: If you get, if you get down on the ground you really can. A: Can you tell but can you tell how, how fast you're going to hit it? B: Um, well, if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it B: but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's, it's, you know, B: because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction. A: Yeah, A: but you can feel that? B: Yeah. A: I don't know A: I have, I can get it within like, you know, four or five feet or something A: but I don't have enough field. A: Now I'm T V watching. B: Yeah. A: They make you die at the hole every time. B: Yeah. A: Oh, it just dies and rolls in. A: I don't know, B: But I, A: it's hard for me. B: The, the, B: it's, it's like I said B: once I get up on the green I'm fine, B: but that, that tee shot, uh, it, you know, B: when teeing off I'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground B: so it, it takes me awhile to get to the hole B: but, A: Once you're there, you're all set though. B: I'm all set. A: We should play team golf then. A: I'll get us there A: and you put it in. B: that sounds good to me. A: I A: oh, the T V golfers they do that. A: It takes them two to get there and two to get it in A: so it's fifty percent. A: And me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in. B: Well, it, it, it usually takes me about probably two, two or three to get it there B: and, and then, that's according to the hole B: and it B: uh, uh, maybe one or two putts. B: It's, according to where I'm at on the green. A: Yeah. A: That's good. B: But the friends I play with, uh, they play all the time B: and, and they're really good. A: Joe Pros? B: Uh, they're not Joe Pros B: but they, they golf in the high sixties low seventies B: so I guess they're pretty good A: That's pretty good. A: For eighteen? B: Yeah. B: For eighteen. A: Wow, A: that's pretty good. B: Yeah. A: I'm talking to the wrong guy. A: Your shitty golf is probably the best golf I've ever seen. B: No, B: no, B: no, B: that's not my golf. B: That's my friends. B: Mine, mine, B: I'm, I'm usually in the eighties or nineties B: so I'm, I'm not good A: If, when I'm in the nineties I'm feeling good. A: I'm usually around a hundred. A: That's my thing. Around a hundred. A: You know, I can hit a great drives and think I'm going to do all awesome on this hole A: but it ain't going to happen. B: Well, I either, teeing off I either slice it B: or I hook it ever single time B: and, and I alternate. A: Well, it's a good thing with me I slice it every single time. A: That's good. A: I aim, B: Okay. A: Okay. B: Universal health insurance, B: right? A: That's right. A: What would we like to say A: I think, A: Uh-huh. A: I think that's what the subject is about. B: Did you read, uh, the article in the paper today about this particular subject? A: In the Dallas, the MORNING TIMES? B: Yeah. A: I guess I did not. B: Uh, the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is, uh, going to begin testing a program, a state funded program for citizens of those two states B: and there's fourteen other, uh, states that are considering it. Least according to the article in the paper this morning. B: I think it's a trend that's, that's, that's, uh, probably may go nationwide eventually because I think national health is something that we all need. B: It's getting to a point that you have to have it, B: you have to have some form of health insurance. A: Well, it's been interesting that we, B: Extremely expensive, though. A: Yes. A: So we live in a society, though, where everyone if you ask them on polls, will, uh, say that they think that everyone has a right to health care. B: Uh-huh. A: And yet, I don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it. B: Well, that's the thing, you know, B: uh, unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are, are paying for the people that don't have health insurance. A: Which is why people are talking about A: we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair. B: Yeah. B: I don't think you, uh, A: You have health insurance? B: Yes, B: I do. A: Through your company? B: Uh, through my company, B: yes. B: But I have been in a situation, uh, recently where I was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year B: and my wife developed cancer. B: We didn't have any insurance. A: Oh, my goodness. B: And it was a go to Parkland type situation. A: That's must have been hard A: How was your care at Parkland? B: Uh, because it was a life threatening situation, it was very good. B: Uh, as it, as it turned out one of the top, uh, people, think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations. B: They are B: but parents, A: You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that, B: Yeah, B: they do. A: and they don't follow it at all, you know. A: There are very few Scouts go on, and become Eagle Scouts. B: Oh, no. A: And, and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals A: but, B: I, I, uh, B: senior. A: Oh. A: Senior, A: okay. A: So, there's not, uh, B: Oh, they're just not, B: once they get into junior high it just, not done anymore A: Yeah, A: they, they lose interest. A: and then when they young, young adults, there's even less interest there. B: Uh-huh. A: They're more for, I B: Me A: Not, not, A: yeah. B: Grab, B: grab, B: grab, B: walk out A: Yeah, A: you're absolutely right B: Yeah A: I think it's a really a good thing. A: I, I like to see, A: of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help B: Yeah, B: but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country, too. A: But I think, we ought to start right here at home. A: I'm, you know, B: Yeah, B: uh, I'm not, I'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young people. A: No, A: it, it, B: But, since there is much that needs to be done here. A: I think that, yeah, I think that we need to really address what we've done here A: and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook. B: Uh-huh. A: Well, it's been really good. A: We talked about this for a few minutes, A: and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday, A: but I, I don't really have too much more to say on this topic, I guess. B: No, B: I, I agree with you A: It, we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing, that they should do sometime. B: Yeah. B: Okay. A: Well you take care, A: and, and, enjoy the day. B: You, too. B: You, too. A: Thank you, ma'am. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Do are you on a regular exercise program right now? B: Yes, B: and I hate it B: How about you? A: Oh, well, I'm kind of off and on. B: Off and on B: well, I guess I've been kind of off and on B: I've, uh, Had some health problems that have led me to, uh, A: Right now I'm kind of off. B: I'd say more on than off A: Okay, A: what type of exercise do you do? B: Uh, I do walking on the treadmill, B: and then I do low impact aerobics. A: Okay. A: I guess you don't enjoy that very much. B: Not, not really. A: Do you find that, uh, to be boring? B: Yeah, B: and time consuming, B: I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming, B: it's, uh, you know, afterwards, you know, B: then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, you know. A: Yeah. A: Well, I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring. B: Oh, yeah. A: But I, B: Do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year A: Yeah, A: I haven't decided whether, whether I want to play yet or not A: I just bought myself a solo flex machine, A: I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V. B: Uh-huh. A: It's one of those, uh, universal type machines, exercise machines. A: But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet, A: so it's collecting dust right now. B: Yeah, B: a lot of things do that. B: I had an, I had an exercise bike A: I used to jog somewhat. B: I use to have one, B: and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it, B: but I do use my treadmill A: Uh-huh, A: well, that's good. A: Yeah, A: my parents have a treadmill A: it's, A: when I go visit them, uh, I get on that thing every now and then. B: Yeah, B: it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't, you don't have any excuse. A: Uh-huh, A: I just got the bicycle out today, A: and it was real nice outside, A: had to get out to do something. B: Yeah, B: I can't ride a bike B: so. A: I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold A: so thought I, better, better get outside and do something and not waist the day. B: Oh. B: Yeah, B: it's too nice, B: it's been too nice all weekend. A: But, uh, yeah, A: I need to start jog something again. A: I've always of that to be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise, A: but it's terribly boring, A: and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently. B: Have you ever had any injuries from jogging? A: No, A: I never have. A: Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries A: I usually only go about a mile or two. B: I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt, worse. A: Yeah, A: it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt. B: Uh-huh. A: Suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on. B: Yeah, B: that's not quite so so easy. A: You have to have the right, type of shoes too, A: that's, very important. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: I found that, true especially from walking on toe and fronts . A: But, A: Yeah, A: I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often A: my don't get very much use B: Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months. A: Uh-huh. A: I usually enjoy the exercise I do A: but, uh, like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program. A: So I'll, I'll bicycle A: I get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile, A: but then I'll get tired of doing that, and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week. A: But, uh, that gets old too in a very short order, B: Yeah. A: I'm, I'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a little bit, A: I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis. B: Yeah, B: well, don't let it collect dust. B: At least exercise while dusting it off A: Yeah. B: well. A: Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, uh, start some type of, uh, regular program. B: Yeah, B: that, that'll be good. A: I've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep, uh, keep something going. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, when I was in high school we had a choice of, uh, taking, uh, physical education courses on exercise, A: an, uh, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, uh, working out like that. B: Oh. A: And that was very helpful A: we kept charts of our progress, and, uh, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks. B: Uh-huh. A: I found that to be, uh, very helpful. B: Are you going to do that? A: Uh, I need to, A: I haven't started yet A: but, uh, it's a thought. B: Well, that sounds like something good to do then. A: Sounds like something I should do. B: Yeah, B: nice way to start off this spring. Get back in shape. A: How often do you, uh, uh, go out each week on your walking? B: Well, I do, B: I switch every other day B: one day I walk B: and one day I do the aerobics. A: Okay, A: how far, about how far do you go walking? B: Well, I'm trying to get my tolerance now B: I just had surgery, um, less then two months ago, B: and right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half, A: Okay. B: but I'm trying to workup to three miles. A: Well, that's good. A: Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging. B: Yeah, A: It, B: it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect. A: Sure. B: Yeah, B: but. A: Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, uh, keep the heart rating going, uh, B: My walkman broke, A: Yeah. B: so I'm upset B: and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud A: Yeah. A: But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is. B: Yeah, B: it is B: and this doesn't, you know, B: my treadmill has an incline B: and, you know, you can get a really good workout on it. A: Um, do you go to an aerobics class A: or do you watch, on T V? B: No, B: I, I just do it on T V, A: Okay. B: I have a cassette. A: Which, uh, shows do you watch on T V? B: Um, it's a, it's a B: I use tapes. A: Oh, okay, A: okay, A: like a Cathy Smith workout, B: Or, or Richard Simmons, A: or Jane Fonda. A: Okay B: Sweating to the oldies A: Right. A: I, every now and then I'll watch E S P N, A: I get cable on T V, B: Uh-huh. A: and they have, uh, a couple of shows called basic training, A: and, uh, what is the other one called. B: There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N, B: I don't know if he's still on any more or not, B: I I don't know if I get E S P N or not A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, one, you know, B: I use to watch one, watch one on the air, B: but that was back, A: BODIES IN MOTION that's, that's the name of the one I was thinking of. With Gill. B: That's was, B: yeah. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I watched that cause he was cute A: Yeah, A: he's not bad A: his assistants usually aren't either. B: But, uh, A: They're always in, in Hawaii some place. On, on the beach. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: But then that was back when, uh, you know, the high impact and, A: Yeah, A: well, they, they do low I pact stuff now, B: Do they. B: Are B: yeah B: they're still, they're still, he's still doing it then, uh. A: Yeah, A: every morning. B: I'll have to tune in. A: It's on E S P N, uh, A: at what time, A: I can't remember what time. A: It's, uh, you know, A: I can't remember offhand what time. B: I'll have to check it, check, check, check it back up, A: Yeah B: and, but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show, at least on A: Yeah, A: every now and then. B: Not everybody has a picture perfect body. A: Uh-huh, A: well, I found that they, they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V. B: I haven't watch any other ones on T V. watch=watched Just on some of the tapes. A: They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day. Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that. B: Okay, B: thanks. A: but, uh, I haven't done so much as, uh, watch the tape that I made. B: Now, that's a thought. A: So I'm kind of bad about that myself. B: Well, that's thought, B: I haven't thought about that, B: well they're going to beep us pretty soon. A: Okay, A: well, I sure enjoyed, to you about exercise and fitness. B: Nice talking to you too. B: Okay, B: thanks. A: So, all right. B: Talk to you later. A: Good night. B: Bye. A: Bye. B: Uh, well what would you say your opinion is on gun control? A: Well, I don't know. A: I've, I've had mixed emotions, I guess, when I listen to, uh, the radio and, and watch T V about the different, uh, things that are happening. A: Uh, I'm against it A: but on the same token, uh, I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that A: So I, I have a rifle in the house. A: Uh, the ammunition is probably so old I'm afraid to use it. A: But, uh, I bought it for target practicing and, uh, and also because I wanted a weapon. A: Uh, how do you feel about it? B: Well, I think, uh, down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns. A: Huh. B: And, I think they need that. B: Uh, and I do have a, I have a pistol. B: It's a little twenty-two B: and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun. A: Uh-huh. B: you know, I do like to have my guns. B: Uh, I don't know if I'll ever use it, you know. B: And like you, my bullets to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old B: Uh, my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, I like to have them where handy. A: Well, up, uh, up in New England where I'm from, uh, you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammunition. A: And I thought that was really good. A: And I think if they, uh, A: takes two weeks for that system to process, uh, your request for, uh, not as a gun permit but, uh, but to buy ammunition. A: You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that. B: I've never heard of anything like that. A: Yeah. Uh, B: That would be nice. B: But, you know, B: the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other. A: I I, I agree. A: I think, you know, one of the things that, that, that needs to happen is, uh, to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, buying it quickly and, and, uh, maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it. A: But if someone's really determined to, to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place. B: Yeah A: And you can get them really cheap. B: I know B: I, I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in, uh, Tennessee. And, uh, they had a waiting period A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, we bought it there. B: And, A: How long was the waiting period out there? B: About nine days. A: Huh. A: That wasn't too, too bad. B: No. B: No A: Because if, if you're going to go buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, I think you, you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it. A: You're not going to react that quickly. A: In other words, you know, you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day. B: somebody wants to do that, B: I, I, at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms. A: Yeah. A: I do too. Uh, because it doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, I suppose. A: They both do the same kind of job. B: A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does. A: Uh, yeah. A: I suppose. A: I never got shot with either one. A: But I don't know, uh, A: I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun B: No, B: a shotgun's got too much of a spread. B: Or at least ours does. A: Yeah. B: Uh, it's, you know, B: you have a little, uh, thing on the bottom of on top of the barrel where you, you turn it, A: Uh-huh. B: you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get. A: Oh. B: And the spread changes. A: Uh, I've got a manual single shot A: and I guess it doesn't have any, any automatic features to it. A: The further away I get, the, the, uh, wider the shot gets from the target. B: Yeah. A: And the closer that I get, the tighter that it gets. A: It's got a hell of a kick to it. B: Yeah. B: My husband had a, uh, a police gun at one time. B: And I shot that thing one time. B: Almost knocked me down. B: And it just a B: I I forget, B: I think it was a three fifty-seven. B: I'm not sure. A: Do you belong to a gun club or you? B: He belonged to one awhile back. B: Uh, since we moved, B: we've only been here in Texas for about a year A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, we can't even find a place to shoot. Just for target practice. A: No kidding. B: I'd love to get used to that shotgun. B: We traded his pistol for that shotgun. A: Huh. Well the, the, uh, clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive A: but, uh, it's well worth it. A: You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition. A: Uh, I've never really joined a club because I haven't got the time. Not because I haven't got the desire. A: Uh, there's an annual membership fee, uh, that's, that's fairly high. A: Plus there's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time, uh, uh, member. A: So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club. A: Plus you have to pay for the, the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in. B: Yeah. B: Well, that's what my husband, B: when he was in that gun club where he was doing that tell if it's a cough or something was B: It, you know, B: he went mostly just to, uh, shoot at paper targets. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, but, you know, they used speed and accuracy and all that. A: I think that, that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose. A: In fact, I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to, uh, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon. B: That's a good, B: I've never thought of that. B: That's a good point. A: And, you know, it, it, A: even after you wait your nine days, if you don't know how to handle it, it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive. A: And you give him a license because he waited nine days. B: Yeah. B: That's, B: and, yeah. A: He could, he could not only, uh, uh, shoot himself. A: He could, he could, uh, mishandle a weapon. Leave it at home and let a child get at it. B: It, B: well we, uh, we was living on a navy base down in Memphis B: and, uh, this one guy decided to play, uh, lonesome cowboy or something. B: And he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot. A: Wow. A: He was fortunate. A: He could, he could of hit something else B: Well, he went tumbling down the steps along with, uh, shooting his foot almost off. B: He broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things I'm sure, being, Mister Cowboy. A: Wow. B: I can't remember what the the term was going around. B: It was about four or five years ago. B: But. Now, I guess that would be a good idea A: About, uh, private citizens selling a weapons? A: Like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me. A: How do you feel about that? A: Do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the, uh, buyer and the seller? A: And, or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system, uh, because you own it? B: Uh, that's a hard one because we did that. B: But, uh, I think there ought to be some rule against it. B: I'll, uh, you know, B: the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something, the cops are going to come to you. A: Yeah. A: isn't there a way to, uh, to deregister yourself after you register a gun? B: Uh, B: I have no idea. B: I've only had one gun A: Because I have, B: and I've kept it, you know, the one gun that was in my name. A: Yeah. A: Is it registered? B: Yeah. A: The, uh, the rifle that I've got is not registered, A: and, uh, I don't know why I never registered it A: but the, uh, B: I don't think you have to register a shotgun A: Um, I, I think it's, it's voluntary A: The, uh, the, B: Well, see, uh, my husband has a thing. B: If they go to, uh, regulating, uh, all right, uh, banning guns. private citizens A: Yeah. B: this, B: my kid is jumping on me. B: I can't hardly talk. B: My husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns. A: Yeah. A: I guess that could happen. A: It's just like the, uh, the social security system A: Once they, uh, they gave everybody a number A: and now they're making you, uh, uh, get one at, at birth. A: And once they have your number, they have your identification. B: Yeah. A: And if you try to do anything, uh, like, uh, not identify yourself to the government, they know who you are. B: Yeah. B: And everything about you. A: And , that's true B: Uh, I, B: you know, they know so, how much money you make a week to, uh, probably your, uh, B: my kid is banging. B: I was seeing what they was banging on. B: Uh, I've lost my train of thought. B: I'm sorry A: That's all right. A: You, you were talking about, uh, uh, what the Federal government knows about people. B: Oh, the B: Yeah. B: They, they probably know everything from, half the time what time you go to the bathroom. A: They probably do. B: No, B: that's that's a little bit extreme. B: But they could know anything and everything about you. B: And, uh, I'd like to have my gun. B: If they go to banding, banning them, I'd lose my gun B: but we wouldn't lose our our, uh, shotgun. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about. A: Uh-huh. B: But I don't, I don't, uh A: Do you find it difficult picking up, uh, guns that, that are not registered? B: No. A: No. A: I don't either. A: I can, I can buy some, uh, today if I wanted to. A: Just you know, put up the money. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: Well, you can look in the, uh, the, B: we got a thing down here called A SHOPPER. A: Uh-huh. B: It's a, a it's a, it's a bargain thing. B: Uh, you go and you know, always see guns in there. Five to seven guns a day. A: Yeah. B: It comes out every Tuesday. A: And there's, there's no waiting period on that. B: No. B: None whatsoever B: You call, B: we sold a refrigerator through it B: and it took us all of twelve hours. A: To sell the refrigerator? B: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: You know. And I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun. A: Huh. And I think the Federal government is, uh, is really far away from, uh, uh, control. A: I, I don't believe in, uh, A: I'm I shouldn't probably say control. A: I mean regulation. A: Control is something that I wouldn't want the Federal government to have. A: Uh, but I would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons. B: Yeah. B: Well, I agree with you there. B: They do have too much control over us already. A: Yeah. B: Uh, we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have. A: Unfortunately, we, uh, we vote for the, the people who spend the money, A: so I can't complain too much. B: Yeah, B: I guess so. B: I don't know. B: They're A: Well, I haven't heard anything about the proposal myself, A: but, uh, Uh, I don't know if its their proposal or one that's being seriously kicked around. B: No, B: I haven't either. A: I've, I've always felt for a long time that I, I think that all young kids ought to do a stint, uh, primarily in the military. B: Yeah. A: Uh. B: Most countries require that now, B: they you know, they have, uh, it mandatory for, for the, the uh at least the young men, A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't know about the young women, B: I don't know if they have to serve in the military, too. A: Yeah, A: a lot, A: yeah, A: well, you take Israel A: I mean, everybody does. B: Yeah. A: I don't think it's a bad idea, A: teaches, teaches a lot. A: I mean, I went in the service when I was eighteen, And, uh, stayed in for ten years. B: Uh-huh. B: Is that right? A: Yeah, A: uh, did a lot of growing up. B: I bet. B: You have to. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: my father had been in the military. B: I didn't do it myself. B: My father had B: and that's, uh, how he put himself through school basically. A: Yeah. B: He came from a poor immigrant family, B: and he didn't have a chance to, uh, you know, B: the family wasn't wealthy, B: so he had to do something to, put himself through school, A: Do it himself. B: and he did. B: And he was very successful. A: Well, my parents wanted to send me to college, A: and I was dead set against it A: You know, I had wanderlust, you know. B: Yeah. A: And I got in, A: and after, after wasting the first six years, partying and everything else, I decided, uh-huh, time to settle down and do something. A: So I started to work on my education. B: Yeah. A: Course my job was such that I didn't, I couldn't do it as much as I wanted B: Uh-huh. A: and still I ended up going two semesters when I got out just to get my degree. B: That's pretty good. A: But, I've been in school ever since B: That's good. A: Yeah, A: I guess. B: Yeah, B: that's, uh, B: I don't know. B: There's other kinds of service to the country that could be done, you know, A: Yeah, A: I mean if you don't like, B: I mean, working in the national parks, Uh, working, clean up the roadsides A: Sure. A: Exactly. B: I mean, I've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time, *why no slash? not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job, but at least some of their time to look for, to go out and clean up the roads. You know, A: Oh yeah, Absolutely. B: I mean, A: All these, all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients, A: and if they're able-bodied people, I don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and, and, if nothing else, get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards, paint the houses. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: we'd learn service to other people in this country. A: Sure , A: sure. A: So I'm, A: get something out of that money. B: Country would benefit, A: Yeah A: I've, B: I mean, uh, A: yeah, A: yeah, A: my next door neighbor when I was growing up, worked for the unemployment division, A: and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied A: and, B: That right. A: Yeah, A: and he, he had all kinds of horror stories. A: You know, these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks, A: and, back, back in those days they also use to give you, uh, booklets good for, uh, clothing and gas, and things like this B: Yeah. A: They get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know, B: Yeah. A: and I'm, I I have a hard time dealing with that. B: What I hear one time, I think it was on Paul Harvey's, uh, radio segment, that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy, each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, I was astounded. B: I don't even make that. A: No, A: I know. A: I, you, you think about, you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient, B: Yeah, B: and somebody's taking that away. A: and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy. B: Yeah, B: no doubt. A: You know, it's, it's, it's totally ridiculous, A: and now, I, I, I, uh, started out when I first got in graduate school A: I was going into public administration, A: and, uh, quite honestly I just got so fed up with it I just couldn't stand it any more. B: Is that right, A: Yeah, A: I mean, this is the kind of thing you look at. B: Yeah. A: You sit there A: and when you're writing up budgets, you wonder, okay, how much money do we need. A: Well, you need X number dollars for the recipients A: but you need X number dollars to administer the program. A: Well just ridiculous. B: Yeah. A: This is ridiculous. B: It's sad. A: It is, A: it's pathetic. A: I mean, there's got to be a different way. A: There's got to be a better way. A: But it'll never happen. A: I mean, these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: What would happen if the required young people to do service to the country, B: what should they get in return, I wonder. B: Like, uh, A: I think, I think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as, uh, A: and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance. B: Yeah. A: Give an incentive. B: Educational or vocational training or something. A: Yeah. A: Something that's going to help them along the way. B: And they'll help the country eventually, too, because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people, A: Sure, A: I mean, A: Well, this, A: I mean I mean, look at the statistics, B: and that's only going to help. A: I mean, it's sad. A: One in five Americans can't read B: Yeah. A: adults, that is, can't even read. A: And, and we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math. B: Yeah. A: I mean, what are we, what are we becoming? A: We're becoming a service country. B: As opposed to what we were twenty years ago. A: Yeah, A: we were an industrial giant, A: and now we're we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game. A: We taught them how to do it, A: and they, they did it better than we do. B: Yeah A: Simple as that. B: because they have the ambition, I guess. A: yeah, A: simple as that. B: Yeah, B: which is good for them, B: but on the other hand, we kind of lose out. A: Yeah, A: it's terrible for us. B: I think that if, uh, young people had service to the country might give them more ambition. Because they learn that serving other people is a good thing. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: and, and it can be good for them, too. B: Yeah, B: oh yeah. A: I mean, even, even the greedy kids that we've got now ... B: Oh god, you go to the mall B: and you see, you know, fourteen year old kids flaunting money, because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night, you know A: I know. B: for what. A: I know. B: Give me the money B: and I'll, I'll teach them something good A: Well, you know, you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: uh, that's my other complaint. A: Parents aren't parents any more. B: No. B: They've, they've relinquished their parenting. A: Yeah. A: One of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble? B: Yeah. A: Well, as a substitute teacher for a year, I, I can say yes. B: Yeah, B: I mean, I talked with somebody else about that another time, B: and, you know, when I's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math, I was, uh, teaching as part of my, part of the program. B: And I just love teaching. B: That was a lot, that's probably the most fun I had. B: And, uh, it helped me out because I learned things and learned how to do things differently. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: And when, uh, when come time to get out of school, I thought, Boy, I'd like to teach. B: But you know, for, for what. A: Yeah. B: You know, I don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life. A: Exactly. B: I mean, that, that's a sad thing to think, B: and that's kind of selfish on my part, B: and I admit that, A: Well, in a way it is, A: but you have to look out for yourself you know, B: Yeah, B: that's right. A: I mean, that's A: and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers, B: That's wrong. A: Yeah, A: gosh, A: I mean, B: I'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less, B: I saying teachers should be paid more. A: No, A: I mean yeah. A: They do an absolutely necessary job, A: I mean, I, I have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, I mean, there's, there's a sense of priorities here, too. B: Yeah. A: You know, we need, A: what's more important, picking up the garbage or educating our kids. B: Yeah B: They both have their place. A: Yeah, A: they, they, A: sure. B: But, you know, when it gets right down to it, A: I mean, one's A: I mean, on the other hand, I mean, you take a garbage man in New York City starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars. B: That's pretty good. A: Well I bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year. B: Yeah. A: I mean, my other pet peeve is unions. B: Yeah, B: oh yeah. A: You know, it's just, it's, it's ridiculous the way unions have gone. A: There was a time when unions were needed. B: And they served a good function. A: And they served a good function, A: but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated, A: and they're only there to perpetuate their own, their own power structure. B: I remember, the company my dad worked for, the people there went on strike against the management. B: It was a steel manufacturing place, B: and they, uh, B: this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap, B: and they were having a hard time. B: And they told the strikers there, look, B: we need you to come back and get this stuff done. B: Or else we're going to be out of business. B: And they wouldn't come back, B: so they went bankrupt. A: Yeah. B: And, and they all lost their jobs. A: Sure, A: and, and and that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country. B: And it's like , you know. B: Yeah. A: So many times, I mean, you had the, uh, the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time. A: And, well, that took care of that industry B: That's right. A: and, and, then, and I'll tell you, A: Detroit worked awfully hard on, on stopping car manufacturing in this country. B: And they're trying to do that now with the imports. A: Yeah, A: I mean, you know, we've never caught up, A: and I don't think we ever will. B: It'll be a tough road, though. A: Yeah, A: I mean, here it is, A: and we've got, we've got to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars. B: Yeah. A: You know And they only did it because they, I guess they were embarrassed that they're so good at it B: Yeah. B: That's about right. A: Gosh. A: Yeah, A: well, back to the original subject, A: yeah, A: I think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service, A: I don't care what kind it is. B: It teaches them pride in their country. A: Yeah, A: and pride in themselves, too. B: That's right. A: They could, they could, I mean, you could organize something just within your community. same old thing. B: Yeah, A: I mean, B: that's right. B: That's like Eagle Scouts. A: Sure. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's a great idea. A: I think they ought to take them and, I don't know, just have sort of like a, a, a manpower pool and say Okay, look, A: we need somebody ... A: Okay, A: we're going to talk about the public school system, What's wrong with it, an, or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it, what should be done about it. B: Okay. B: Fantastic. B: Well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is, uh, about the, uh, funding of, the, the school system right now. A: Yeah. B: Evidently, uh, that's, that's a big problem. A: Yeah, A: it's amazing, uh, A: I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough, I mean, to be doing what they're doing, uh. B: Right. A: When I was in college I, I enjoyed teaching, A: 'cause I did some teaching part-time A: and I really enjoyed that A: but I wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high, A: it just, you know, all the problems. B: Oh, Lord, I mean, yeah, B: an, you talk about stress and pressure, B: I tell you what, B: it's, uh, A: Yeah, A: they're putting in fifty, sixty hours a week, A: I'm sure, because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready. B: Do, B: right. A: And, you know, and they're being paid, probably half what most people being paid. B: Exactly, B: and, A: And we're paying basketball people, you know, millions of dollars a year for, for what, you know. B: That's right, B: and then they, uh, poof it off, you know, do like Tarpley. A: Yeah. B: But, uh, I B: what gets me is I can't believe that Congress, uh, or, our state legislature can't come up with, uh, some kind of workable means to have funds for the school. B: You know, it's, uh, B: I just don't understand that. A: Yeah, A: it's, uh. A: Now do you have little kids, or what? B: No, uh, B: sure don't, B: my wife and I've just been married about two years B: but I have a sister that's a, uh, school teacher, B: and, uh. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: my wife and I have a, a three year old, almost four and a, a two year old. B: Okay. A: So we're looking at the, the older one going to school next year. Not, not, well not this coming fall but the year after that. B: Okay, B: so it's getting close. A: Yeah, A: he's going to be going to kindergarten, A: so. B: Right. A: So, you know, we're, we're thinking about that. A: What's that going to be like. A: Are they going to be taught nothing, A: or they going be taught something, A: we're going to, we're going to be involved in our child's education. A: We're going to be teaching him what we can at home, of course, because, uh, I guess we don't trust the school system, which is very sad, uh, B: Right. A: but. But if it doesn't start at home, it's not going to go anywhere. You know, B: Exactly. B: Right, B: that's true. A: and we're going to try to teach him good values, because, you know, when, when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them, well hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what's important. Not if you can read or write, or do, or understand some science. You know, B: Exactly. A: I mean give me a break, A: that's, that's, that's bogus. B: Right, B: right. B: Well and, uh, you know, one thing my wife and I've talked about, are, uh, private schools. You know whether, uh, uh, we would want to invest in, in private schools as they're growing up, because, you know, just in the Dallas area, um, we're not real comfortable with the, with the public schools. A: Yeah. A: And Dallas, uh, school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling. B: Right. A: I couldn't believe that. B: Right. B: You know, one, that's one reason we bought a house here in Plano. B: We were hoping, you know, well the school district's going to be good, you know, for resale value, and, so on and so forth, A: Yeah. B: but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern. A: Yeah, A: we talked, you talked about before, about the school funding. A: I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way A: but I think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids. A: That's the only way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for property, and people are going to throw a fit. B: That's, B: yeah, B: and, you know, that's, B: taxes right now are political suicide. You know, A: Oh, yeah. B: and I don't think any politician's going to do that, B: so. A: Yeah, A: and the only thing, they, they would think of would be tuition, you know, A: if it works at colleges it will work down below. B: Right. A: And, you know, that's going to, that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school, of course, which is probably the only fair thing to do. A: But, it will be hard for those that people, that have, have in school because they have to pay out even more. B: Exactly. B: And, you know, it's going to really hurt the, the middle class, uh, people, I think. Because, uh, they're the ones that will probably have to, to carry the brunt of the load. A: Oh, yeah. A: That's right. B: So, uh, A: And most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and, and knives and everything, A: I mean, good grief what's . B: Yeah B: now, that's, that's just unbelievable to me, you know. A: I can't believe that. A: I mean when I was in junior high and high school that never happened. A: You never heard about that. B: Well yeah, B: we didn't, we didn't even think about it, you know A: No. A: And now, you know, what do we have now. A: You know, got kids that, either got a, you know, a Magnum gun school, A: like good grief. B: right. A: I mean, I'd, I'd be afraid to be in school, I mean teaching, or even being a student A: and think what, what's it going to be like for my, my youngest, an my oldest son, when he goes to school. A: What's going to happen? A: I mean I, I'm afraid for him to go. B: Exactly, B: right. A: But there again , you can't hold them back. B: Another reason, B: and you want to encourage them, you know, to, to be active and everything in school, B: but, uh, you know, with all the peer pressure that's going on, with all the negative things, it is, uh, it's a tough environment to be growing up in. A: Yeah, A: and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school, A: and that was, A: well I was, I graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine, A: so. B: Okay. A: That was what, twelve years ago, I guess. B: Right. A: So, you know, it's lot different now. A: And what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my, uh, oldest son is in high school. B: That's right, B: that's right. A: I'm afraid to, I'm afraid to even think about it. B: That, yeah, that is a scary thought, B: but, uh, I don't know, B: I, I guess what you have to do is just, uh, keep in, uh, you know, encouraging them and, and, uh, uh, try to be open with them, so that you can deal with the problems as they come up. A: That's all you can do. B: Yeah, B: and. A: You got to, you got to be your child's best friend, I guess, even when they're a teenager and they, you know are kind of standoffish, B: Right. A: still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems, who they going to go to, their friends that are dealing drugs, or, or your parents. You know, B: Exactly. A: an, and if they go to their friends dealing drugs, they're going to be in even worse shape. B: That's right. A: And, and the schools don't, don't really encourage to stay away from that, you know, A: the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war, etcetera, etcetera. A: They don't teach them good values like drugs are bad. A: I, maybe I'm wrong, because I haven't, you know, been in that kind of environment for a long time, A: but, it just is amazing, you know, B: Right. A: need to teach them good values. B: That's true, B: that's true, B: and, uh. A: Of course, if I say this is a good value, someone else is going to stand up and say, oh no. A: And the A C L U is going to get after them and have a lawsuit. Which is going to take twenty years to resolve, you know. B: Right. B: Well and I think, uh, you touched on it, you know, B: you've got to start them at the home. You know A: Yeah. B: that's where they, that's where they get the, the deep rooted values B: and, and, and, uh, and that's about right. A: That's all you can do. B: Then you just have to hope and pray that, that everything, uh, works out, works out okay, B: so. A: That's right. A: Well I got to be going, A: so, uh. B: Okay, B: well, hey, I appreciate the call. A: Nice talking to you today. B: You to. A: Have a good life, uh. A: Hi, Wanet is his last A: How are you? B: I'm doing fine. B: Where you from? A: I'm from New England. A: Massachusetts. B: Okay. B: I'm from Berkeley, California. A: Wow! A: This is quite a, quite a long distance. B: Yeah, B: it certainly is. A: Do you have any pets? B: No. B: Use too. B: Use to, B: but none, none right now. A: How come, uh, you don't have any now? A: You get tired of them? B: Well, I, I live in an apartment building B: and, and, uh, and, and, it, it, it's just not feasible you know. A: Yeah. B: I'd love to have a dog, you know. A: I've got a little doggy, uh, that I've had quite, uh, quite a long time. A: In fact, she just turned sixteen years old New Year's Eve. B: Ah. A: And, uh B: Is she? A: I beg your pardon? B: What is she? A: She's, uh, uh, uh, a poodle. A: Uh, a toy poodle, a toy poodle A: and she's, B: Ah. B: Ah, B: my, I got my mom a teacup little mutt , not too long ago. A: This is a little bigger than a teacup. B: Yeah. A: And, uh, it's funny how, uh, how I, I, uh, acquired this animal. A: Uh, when I was, uh, married, my, uh, ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy. That she needed, A: uh, the woman needed someone to baby-sit A: and, uh, this is what she had told the kids A: and she even told me that. A: And after the two week period was up, uh, she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it. A: Well, after you had an animal for a couple of weeks, it's, uh, you become you become attached to it. B: Oh, for sure. B: Oh, yeah. A: So, I've had this dog now for, for sixteen years A: and she's been a lot of company A: Uh, she's, uh, however, getting a little old A: and things are starting to fail. A: Uh, I, I live alone now A: and she stays in the house all day while I go to work A: and, uh, she's been holding herself pretty well. The, uh, up until, you know, recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is A: and, uh, I find a little present on the floor sometimes when I come home. A: But she's, she's usually pretty good. B: Yes, B: well. My, my mother has one that's, uh, B: it's, uh, it's, uh, teacup B: and, uh, it's made such a difference for her. B: But, you know, just, I, you know, B: the way my mom's presence countenance is, just, just for having a puppy B: but, you know, having this dog B: she's had it for, I guess three years now. Oh, possibly four. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, it was, it, it's it's really made such a difference for her. B: I really would like to, uh, B: I'm a disabled person A: Uh-huh. B: so I'm unable to, to, really take care of a pet B: and if that weren't so, I would certainly have one. B: I just, I just, B: it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog B: yeah . A: Huh. Well, you might want to get yourself, uh, an animal that doesn't require much attention. Like a cat. B: Oh, yeah. B: Well, yeah, B: uh, I, I, I typically am not a cat person. B: I have a friend that, uh, has on occasion, uh brought her cat over for me to keep for, you know, from time to time B: And this cat is like no other cat I have ever seen. B: And, uh, it would sleep on my chest, you know. A: Yeah. B: It's just, it's just a great cat, B: but. A: Well, my, my personal preference is, is a dog. A: Uh, I don't know that, uh, that I would ever want a cat. A: Oh, I like cats. A: I just wouldn't want to own one. A: Uh they're not, uh, they're, they're affectionate B: Well, you don't own cats. A: but they, A: yeah A: I don't know, A: I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog. B: Yeah. B: You, they, they own you or, or, you know, grant you with you their presence, you know. A: Yeah, A: right A: Yeah. A: Right. A: That, A: yes, A: we're supposed to appreciate them. A: Well, my, my dog when I came home, uh, when I come home in the evenings, my dog greets me at the door. A: I don't know that a cat would do that, uh B: Yeah. B: I used to have, a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life. A: Yeah. B: I could just walk in the door B: and she knew whether to, to, to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over. B: I mean she really could pick up on my mood uh, the way I walked in the door. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: It was, uh, uncanny like a A: Huh. I, I think, uh, in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because, uh, she knows when I'm upset and I know when she's not feeling good too A: So. B: Yeah. A: I know like when she has an accident, I know she's not doing it on purpose. A: When when she was younger, she used to do that to get even with me, B: Yeah. A: Uh, and, and, you know, some people might not believe that A: but, but, but, uh, I do B: Sure B: Oh, absolutely. A: Like if I, if I put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours, uh, because I was going out. She would, uh, break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to, uh, to, to let me know that she was unhappy with what I did B: Really? A: Yeah. B: That's the way, B: well, I had that cat that I mentioned, Alfie . B: One morning, you know, the first thing you do is you get up and you, you, you feed this cat something and, and you make sure that it can get to its litter box. B: Well, for some reason during the night, the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, the next morning, uh, when my roommate got up and, and, uh, did not feed it right away, it decided that, that it was going to protest. B: And so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket, for me. Looking, looking at me eye to eye, all the time while it was doing it. B: All right. Have I got your attention now? A: Oh, yes. A: Animals have a way of talking B: Alfie did. B: I tell you if I could have gotten a hold of that cat that day. A: I, I don't know that I'd, uh, that I'd trade my dog in for the world. A: Uh, it was about two years ago she got sick on me A: and I took her to the, uh, to the vet's because she wasn't eating and, and, uh, she wasn't able to jump. A: She, you know, lost all her activity A: and, uh, she stayed there for one day A: and the doctor called me up and said, uh, she had a low white cell count and that, uh, she wasn't, she was dying and, uh, suggested that I take her to a working dog hospital, animal hospital A: So I took his suggestion A: and I, uh, took the, the dog to a hospital. The dog hospital there A: and they said they'd keep her there for three days. A: Well, she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care A: It cost me over five hundred dollars. B: Ouch. A: Plus, the, the, uh, the vet sent me a bill for what he did A: and, uh, then she recouped. A: She was okay for a couple of years. A: And then she got sick on me again A: and I brought her to a different vet this time A: and I told you're around the home, though and, and, and can watch T V and read the paper, the problem is, is that about twenty minutes of news radio, or thirty minutes is B: and then they start repeating everything. A: Uh-huh. B: And, and so it's kind of a, oh, B: that's what's interesting is the C N N, uh, B: I don't think, I'm trying to think if it's much local. B: I listen to a little of that B: and I listen to a little of ninety point one. B: I, I'm, I'm inveterate switcher. A: Uh-huh B: That and ninety-eight point seven, I'm eclectic approach. A: Do you have a particular local channel that you watch? B: Well, I watch channel five B: but that has to be, B: that's another bias. A: Uh-huh. B: That has to do with the weather reporting. B: I'm not sure that, B: actually I think channel eight is probably, B: but I know Dave Fox, B: he goes to our church B: so, A: Um. Well I am, we're fairly new to the area A: and so we're still shopping for a favorite channel. B: Well the, Channel eight when they came here thirteen, fourteen years ago, Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together, uh, from Oklahoma City A: Uh-huh. B: and apparently channel eight was way down B: and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job B: and then they've been some people move around B: and, uh, John Chriswell is, anyway, the, B: I, I don't know, B: do you, do you, do you seem to, B: can you tell much difference between the local radio, T V stations? A: Well, I really think so. A: I noticed on channel eight that there's all of the, uh, anchors, are seem to be like white Anglo Saxon protestant type people A: and they all seem to be, you know, fairly similar A: and I kind of prefer a, you know, some females, A: I don't recall that they have any female anchors A: and I like different, I like the anchors to be different kinds of people. B: I think that adds to the diversity, B: I think that, uh, I like that. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, there, I know, you know, John Wylie Price, B: I don't know if you kept up, B: but he's been protesting, A: Yes A: I have A: and, uh, I prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because I think you're, you're more likely to get, B: Yeah, B: and I think he has legitimate argument. B: I mean you can, uh, B: I, I, I grew up in Alabama B: and so I, I have some prejudices. A: Uh-huh. B: But I think that, I think that, that from a, a justice standpoint, because we have the option of not watching that station. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I'm not sure I, I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs B: but I think that, uh, in some cases this should be some real opportunity and, and some diversity, and and this kind of thing A: Yeah. B: and I think that, Dallas, it turns out, though from what I understand, has quite good, B: I occasionally go to Saint Louis. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, there for a few days and watch the news and, and think Dallas really does have, have quite good news. B: I think channel eight is the number one, uh, A B C affiliate in the U S. B: I think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he, A: Oh, really? B: Course he pumping his own A: Well, we, you know, A: like all of the stations seem to be pretty good, A: it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into. B: Where'd you move from? A: Houston. A: So we had a, a favorite, A: or I did, have a favorite channel that I usually tuned into for local news. A: I guess because you get use to, you like the anchors, B: Yeah. A: and you feel comfortable with them A: and, B: It is interesting though, B: it becomes a little of personality. B: In fact, the, the guy that was on, the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, oh, long time ago, twenty years or so, even longer than that. Twenty-one, twenty-three years ago or so, twenty-four, anyway long time ago A: Uh-huh. B: and, and shortly after I got, we got here fourteen years ago B: and, uh, they had, they had fired him, uh, because he was too B: anyway, didn't, he didn't have the personality, and wasn't drawing the crowds A: Uh-huh. B: and that's interesting. B: That's, that's what the T V stations do. B: they're trying to get ratings. A: That's true. B: And I think, if we remember that, that they're out after the ratings. A: Their job. A: That's true. A: So that really effects how they report the news. B: Well, it's like the, the Dale Hansen on channel eight is a, sometimes a little too cutesy B: but, I wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes. A: Is he the sports, B: Have you talked, have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes? A: Yeah, A: I guess it is time to close now, so I can run go help put the kids to bed. B: Okay, B: well good talking to you. A: Yeah. B: Goodnight. A: Bye-bye. A: Are, are you a T I-er? B: No, B: no, B: I work there as a temporary. A: Oh, really. B: But, are you at T I? A: Oh yeah. B: So you have to do the random drug testing. A: Oh, yeah, A: yeah, A: yeah. A: In fact with me, this is, it's not much to talk about, A: I'm so much for it. A: I don't really have much to comment about it. A: There've been some interesting subject that they've called about. A: How many times have you called, A: or have you been participating in this? B: Oh, about ten or eleven calls. A: Oh, you got ten, A: well you, you've passed me up. B: Right. A: This is about six times. B: Oh. B: As contract person we have to do random drug testing, too. A: Yeah. B: It doesn't bother me. B: I don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything. A: No, A: I think it's good. A: In fact, I don't know what the statistics were, A: but I think that they were surprised to find it so low. A: I think they were expecting to find, uh, like the national average at T I. A: And I think it was tremendously down. B: As far as the number of drug users, you mean? A: Yeah B: Huh. A: as far as the number of people they actually found that were drug users. A: But I think that on when I was at T I of course, we had all the information before they started. B: Right. A: And they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs. A: And I think that's what helps, you know, that in the warning that you have a drug program, the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs, actually go A: and then usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything. B: Right, B: yeah, B: so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee. A: Yeah, A: and our numbers have been way down. A: I don't know what they were. B: When I worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person, B: and so we had, B: when we sent temporaries to T I, we had to have their drug tested. A: Yeah. B: And we did have a couple of cases where we really, the person said that they hadn't used anything, B: and their test came back positive, B: and normally we didn't retest them. B: But there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth B: and we retested them like the next day, B: and they came back negative the second time. A: Oh, really. B: So that, that's the only thing, I think, that might be a little bit of a problem. A: Oh, you're, A: that's a good point, A: but at T I they, before they had the testing, I've forgotten, seems like it's a year ago September, something like that, they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government. A: And, of course, that's critical, just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to be, you know, have a lot of quality control, that they keep track of everything. A: They don't make mistakes. A: That would be terribly embarrassing for someone to really come back positive B: Right. A: and they were not. A: And I haven't heard of any, A: now I'm not in personnel or anything. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, they say that there, it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not. A: In other words, there's very few mistakes, A: and that, of course, has got to be critical. A: It's got to be, if you have a drug testing program, A: it's got to be with a very, very good agency. A: You don't just have some local group do it. A: It's got to be a highly qualified agency. B: Right, B: yeah, B: not just some doctor's office somewhere. A: No, A: you don't want to do that. A: It's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check. A: And I think that T I is latched themselves up with an established group. A: And that would be good for any company that does it, and not to have just a very casual thing. A: It's got to be with a, you know, first class, totally independent agency. Not local of course. A: Ours, I think, well I think it was in the south somewhere, A: but it wasn't even in Dallas, you know, the one that did us. B: Oh really. A: Yeah. B: Huh. Do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive, B: or do they fire them right away. A: Oh, no. A: They're not fired. A: They are, they have one chance to then go in a program. A: You come back positive, you have one chance to go in, and go into, they have a lot of, uh, rehabilitation, both for alcohol and for drug use, A: and they have, uh, a lot of, uh, they have an agency where you can go for personal problems, financial or whatever. B: Right. A: And so they, they, they don't, A: no, A: it's not firing first. A: It's, uh, definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate. A: In fact, again, before you go, you know, that's why I said, when they first started it, they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs, go ahead and get rehabilitated first, A: and they won't say anything about it. B: Right. B: I think that's really good. A: Oh sure. B: I know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something. A: Oh yeah, A: no, A: that's not right. A: It's really an illness, or whatever you want to say that it is. A: You know, it's a weakness and all, A: and who, all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another. A: And I think that those people that have that and however they got into it, A: I have children, A: I always worry about the, the classical thing that you see on T V, where the drug pushers give it to the kids for free, you know, and get them sucked in, A: and then they sell it to them. A: You know the classical thing is to give it away. B: Right. A: I always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party A: and they slip it to them. A: I don't know, A: I don't even have that much knowledge to know whether that would get them addicted or not, you know. A: That's a real worry. B: Yeah, B: some of the stories you read about cocaine, that's like people try it one time and they're addicted. B: My husband is a counselor, B: and he works, mostly with adolescents. A: Oh, you know a lot about that. B: So yeah, B: I hear a lot of horror stories about things like that. A: Uh-huh. B: But most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first, B: and then they start a drug problem. A: Yeah. B: It's usually not a one time accidental thing, I don't think. A: Yeah, A: I know, A: I'm glad of that. A: And I have, knock wood, pretty good luck, or very good luck with my daughters on so far, A: that's my conference call, A: I have one daughter still at home. A: One's at U T A: and one's at home, gets dozen calls a night. B: Oh, well I'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that, A: No, A: no, A: I don't care about that, A: she'll be on the phone all night. B: Yeah, B: it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that's best way to avoid trouble, from what I can gather. A: Right. A: Do you have children? B: No B: not yet, B: we're expecting a baby in July, A: Oh, great, B: so we're starting. A: Fantastic experience. A: I've got two, as I said, I've at U T now in Austin, and one at home, A: and I always say that I've learned so much more from them than I ever taught them. B: Yeah. A: It's a fantastic experience. B: Oh, we're really excited about it. A: Oh yeah. B: You know, one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems, he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing, like on a Saturday morning, if they've been out at a party Friday night. A: Yeah. B: If you're not too sure what's going on, he tells parents all the time, haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked. A: The key thing that I think, that we try to do, is that bring all the friends over here. A: Have our house as a place where they can come at any time, so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome B: Right. A: and they're always over in someone else's house. A: So our, we've been lucky that our house is usually the place where the kids could come, you know. B: Uh-huh, B: yeah, B: I think that's a really good thing to encourage. A: And then you can keep an eye, you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want. A: But at least you see what's going on, A: and you always have your house welcome, then your children think that, you know, you're cool parents and all that. B: Right A: Well good luck with your expected baby there. B: Oh well, thanks. A: My wife was yelling, was talking in my ear, A: she said, reminded me to say that they're very cheap until they get to start driving. B: Uh-huh. A: And we have one, of course, I say, in college driving. And one going to drive this summer, A: so kids are, cost you practically nothing, because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything. A: But you wait until they go and get a car, insurance, that's when they get expensive. A: As they get older you know, they cost practically nothing from one to five, B: Yeah. A: and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons, A: but it's well worth it and everything. B: Yeah, B: uh, yeah, B: I think it'll be neat. A: Be a, be a great experience really. A: You still there? A: Okay, A: I thought I was cut off there. A: You know, I don't have much to say about drug testing. B: No, B: I can't think of anything else to say about that either. A: So you've done this ten times? B: Yeah. A: Did you get the booklet on how to get the gifts and all? B: No, B: I don't work for T I, B: so I get cash. A: Oh, okay. A: I didn't know what they were going to do. A: They sent us a little booklet, A: I just got it a week or so ago saying, you know, so many calls will be something a prize and everything. B: Right. A: Well that great. A: Well what kind of cash? A: I've forgotten what they going to do. B: Hm. A: Was it five dollars a call? B: Yeah, B: five dollars a call. A: Well, hope they follow through and everything. B: Well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them B: so I guess we better get off. A: Right, A: yeah, B: It was good talking to you. A: Alright. A: Bye-bye now. B: Bye. A: Well, Wayne, I've never done any, uh, auto repairs myself at all. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean, I may have screwed in a little screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something A: but, uh, I personally haven't done anything. A: Maybe I've, uh, changed wiper blades or something A: but I have noticed since, uh, I got married that my husband, he hates to do auto repairs, A: but he would rather do them himself than, than to pay someone else. A: I guess, he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows, he knows how to do it, A: and he'll do it. A: So, he, he hates the time that he takes, A: but he has changed, um, the brakes A: and he has done all of the tune-ups A: and the like that A: and recently he changed the steering mechanism in the car. A: I was really impressed with that A: We had to have it to get the car inspected, A: it wouldn't pass inspection A: and, and so, he priced around A: and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it A: so, he thought, well, I can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars, which he did A: and then, he did it A: and, so, I guess, uh, he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up, A: what, uh, what's your experience been like? B: Well, I, uh, I have a long experience with cars. B: I, uh, when I was younger, uh, my brother had a Corvette B: and I bought a Corvette B: and when you have a Corvette you more or less do all the work B: and I've done everything from build the motor from the, uh, you know, the bare block on up. B: And, I, I'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car, I hate to go pay somebody good money, you know, B: I hate to pay somebody twenty-five dollars on hour for something I can do myself. A: Uh-huh. B: It just, to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that. A: Right. B: In fact, I, um, just this past weekend put new plugs in both, uh, my car an my wife's car. A: Uh-huh. B: And so, I, uh, I pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything I can do myself B: but I've, I've gotten to the point in my life, um, you know, I just crept over forty years old, where I don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore A: That makes sense. B: I mean it's, um, I don't know whether I've, I've just reached a point, you know, B: it's, it's real rough in the winter time. A: Huh, yes. B: And, uh, so, I try to make sure that, uh, by the time fall runs around, because we actually have winters here on the east coast, um, that, uh, I have, you know, the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter A: Right B: and, uh, then springtime I usually end up giving them, the, uh, a tune-up and make sure that they're running well, B: and, uh, you know, it's like I had the muffler go out on my, on my car, shortly before it was required to go, B: in Maryland they have, uh, emission tests. A: Uh-huh. B: And you're required to get your car and go through the emission test, B: well, my muffler, of course, starting going bad right before I was supposed to go to the emission test, B: so. You know, I had to do that job, B: and of course, that was back in December when it's nice and cold outside A: Yes, A: I'm sure it was. B: But the thing was that I could do the job myself, B: I mean, the parts cost me, oh, roughly a hundred dollars. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, if I'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty-five. A: Right. B: Now like who's got that extra two and a quarter B: I know I don't. A: Yeah. A: Well, that's exactly the way he feels is that, he really hates to spend the time, A: it takes a lot of time A: if he, if he thinks it's going to be two hours, it's four if, you know, whatever, it always takes him twice as long. A: But then when he's finished he's, he always says, well, now you owe me three hundred dollars A: And then he thinks that he has the money that, that he can spend on something A: and he hasn't given it to someone else. B: Yeah. A: So, he gets some satisfaction out of that although, generally I think he, he does not look forward to or anticipate, A: there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars. A: There's a lot of people A: and he just isn't one of them. B: Yeah. B: I, uh, I don't mind it, B: um, there was a time when I had my Corvette, B: I mean, of course, I loved it, um, B: but if, you know, B: I've got other interests now B: and there's a lot, other more important things I think I should be doing with my time. B: And I have the same problem, B: I mean, you can tell him from me B: but it doesn't matter, B: I mean, I've, I've had greasy fingernails for years B: And it still takes me twice as long as I think it's going to take to do the job, A: Yeah. B: so, but, I think the difference is that, uh, when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing, A: Uh-huh. B: and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right, B: and, you know, I've, I've in the past I've had brake jobs done by someone that when I went back and looked at it some months later I'd find something drastically wrong with it, you know, like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident. You know, those kind of things, A: Right. A: Right. B: and when you have a vehicle that's being used by, you know, other members of your family, you know, you don't want that kind of a situation to come up. A: No. B: And it's very, very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust. B: I only have one guy that I know that I trust to work on my car. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, he's about sixty miles from here. B: And so, it, B: and if I have something that's really major that I can't handle or feel I don't have the time to handle, I'll take it to him to do it. A: Right, A: you know, that it's, uh , really has a bad reputation is to feel that, that people in general feel and have, have rightly so, I think been cheated many times, A: and, um, and well, I know once when we had a, A: we usually inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car A: but, um, once the muffler needed to be changed A: and, uh, he had looked at him himself A: and, but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change A: he said, that's really, really good A: so, he went in A: and, uh, but when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something. A: Anyway, but the car that the muffler people had, um, my, at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further, you know, A: they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever, B: Uh-huh. A: and so, since then, I don't think he's ever even seriously considered a, you know, any kind of job he thought he could do himself. A: But, I know from his childhood, he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment, I guess. A: And, um, so, Kelly growing up, he, he felt like that, that was a good way on Saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father. B: Uh-huh. A: And so, he used, they used car repairs kind of as a way to have a, you know, something that they did together, B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: and he thought that turned out pretty good because it, you know, it helped him to understand and be functional now, A: and it helped him to have a close relationship, A: so, that's one, one way he looked at it. B: Yeah. B: that's probably, uh, uh, something that, uh, is, is you know, is good for both of them. B: I know that, uh, my older son I could never get him interested in cars B: and I couldn't, you know, B: I just like, you know, B: you sure you're a boy, B: I mean, your not interested in cars, A: Uh-huh. B: I mean he, he just would not have anything to do with them. B: And, uh, later on and like when he, you know, grew up, got out of the house, got his own car, um, he didn't know how to do anything to it. I mean, absolutely nothing. B: I mean, he couldn't even check the oil. B: I mean, that's, that's how uninformed he was and disinterested. A: Uh-huh. B: And, I guess there are some people out there like that, um, you know, B: I always thought maybe, you know, if he took more of an interest and, you know, what I was doing B: and maybe we could have communicated better. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, yeah, B: I, I think that's great. A: Yeah, A: it didn't always work. A: Well, I felt, um, I feel like I could myself, do some things but, that I have enough responsibility that if I have someone like my father when I was living at home, and my husband, that's willing to do it, I go ahead and let them do it. A: I don't feel the need to, um, you know, be a feminist on that issue and say I can take care of my own things. A: I'm, I'm happy to let them run the cars because I have so, many other responsibilities that, um, A: so, I haven't tried to do a lot myself. B: Uh, I trained my, uh, my wife in the in, in doing things, B: in fact, uh, when I, uh, first transferred down to, uh, Texas Instruments back in nineteen eighty-seven, um, uh, when I left here, uh, she had to change a set of plugs on the car because she was up here for a month or so, after I was A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, it was an interesting experience for her. B: I mean, she'd always assisted me and done some other things B: but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was, uh, it was something, a little different. A: It's a good experience, A: it helps you feel, I think comfortable with your car and feel like, it's not so, scary if, um, your driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might, you think, well, I've, I've been under that hood A: and I know what's going on A: but, B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: I think it's important that everyone know, you know, basically how, how the darn engine works, A: Uh-huh. B: it helps you figure out what's wrong with it, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: I've, I've been out with my sister before when, you know, her car died on the highway B: and I happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all, B: Women? A: Yeah, A: the changing roles of women, how roles changed A: and what do you see coming in the future. B: Oh, okay, B: that's not a broad enough topic A: Okay, A: yeah. A: Sounds good. B: I'm ready when you are. A: Okay, A: hold on. B: Okay. A: Are you there? B: Yeah, B: I'm here. A: Oh my goodness, A: I can't believe I did that. A: Okay, A: hold on. B: That's okay. A: Okay, um, A: I. B: Okay, B: um, I don't know, B: are you in your thirties, B: or, A: No, A: I, I'm twenty-three. B: Oh, okay. A: Uh-huh. B: Well then I can tell you that roles have changed. B: I'm thirty-eight A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: and they changed quite a bit. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, I, B: this was my twentieth high school reunion, in Chicago. A: Uh-huh. B: And basically, um, the choices, I mean, you know, B: you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that. A: Right, A: uh-huh. B: That's kind of, um, the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies. A: Right. B: It was sort of just to um, go protest, A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, just, everybody be damned and live with some one, B: and, you know, social morals were a little bit lacking. A: Uh-huh, A: I know that, A: Uh-huh, A: I know that, uh, in, in the early seventies, uh, I think women were the first people to, to make a move as far as individuals. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, uh, before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like, uh, black people, or, you know, just large, large groups of people, A: but, but the, B: Right B: it was more, it was more civil rights oriented, or race oriented rather than gender based, A: Right, B: yeah. A: and I think, I think the women's movement kind of brought in individual lives where you had women's movements A: and you had gay movements, and just the smaller groups of people. B: Uh-huh. B: It did. A: And I think since then is, is when a lot of the women's roles have started to change. B: It did B: and some of the other stuff that, um, I think that changed it, you, uh, when I first got out of college fifteen years ago, they were always saying well, if you, if you were assertive you were a libber, B: or you were aggressive not assertive and independent. A: Uh-huh. B: And in terms of the corporate community, I've seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote, unquote, used to women, who are in, uh, controlling positions, as higher, you know, corporate, in the corporate hierarchy. A: Uh-huh. A: Exactly. A: Uh-huh B: So I think that's good. A: I think that, uh, you know, you can just look at home life and see, I've been talking to a lot of people about education and things, and, and what, what, what affects the school system B: Uh-huh. A: and I think that a big thing that effects it is that the mother is not home anymore, um, like she used to be. B: Right. A: She used to be kind of a, kind of a, a rock, you know, in the house, B: The mainstay, B: yeah. A: yeah. A: And, uh, since, since everyone is going out and working now, whether it be because of finances or just the economy, uh, the mother's not there anymore B: and restructuring, stepfamilies, B: yeah. A: and the children are, A: I think, I think a lot of society is suffering. A: Not to say that women shouldn't, you know, go out and do what they want to do A: but I think that, um, society's really going to have to get used to it. B: Right. A: And they're not quite used to it yet A: and that's I, B: The schools or the the schools or the parents, B: yeah. A: Yes, A: uh-huh. B: Um, I'm trying to think of what else. B: I have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden I went blank B: A lot of the things, um, the demographics do, B: I mean, there are more, B: I don't have the numbers in my head right now, B: but, a lot of the things that brought feminism, I mean there are just more women in, in, in the demographics, just generally, in the United States, in terms of being, A: Right, A: uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, I'm the typical baby boomer, B: I hate that term, A: Oh, yeah. B: but in terms of women, women going out, I mean twenty-three, I remember that. A: Yeah. B: What's it like to be twenty-three as a woman today, B: I mean, when I was twenty-three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married, A: Uh-huh. B: um, those were the general issues. A: Speaking of getting married, I was talking to someone yesterday on this, on the project, B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, uh, we were talking about child care A: and he asked me if I had any kids. A: He was about forty or fifty years old A: and I said no, I'm just twenty, B: He was ancient, B: yeah. A: and I said no, I'm just twenty-three, you know, because I don't think of myself as needing to have children B: Uh-huh. A: but the first thing he says is, well don't you miss that part of your life. A: And I just, A: I, A: my, my mind just went, B: You didn't know what you're going to be missing. A: I went, what. You know, A: because it it really didn't, doesn't even occur to me right now to have children, B: I don't have any either B: and I've been a married for eleven years, B: so. A: Yeah, A: and I, it just, you know, A: I think that I'll probably have children when I'm about thirty, thirty-five, something like, just because, I'm not sure if it's just, if it's just me, or, or women in general that are twenty-three right now, because, um, I'm really into my career. B: Yeah, B: when it's time, B: uh-huh. A: I'm trying to go somewhere, and, and get there quick and then worry about, you know, because right now, in my career I'm, I'm really starting out, B: Yeah, B: you want to establish, A: and it's going to take me a while to move up. B: Uh-huh, A: And I don't need anything kind of holding me back, um. B: Right B: and, and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of, um, women don't feel like they need to get married anymore. A: Uh-huh. A: Right, A: uh-huh. B: I was twenty-seven when I got married B: and I just at the time, um, B: my husband actually even jokes about it. A: Uh-huh. B: He was twenty-three when we met B: an I was at a point where it was like, I didn't date, B: I mean, I just, I went out to have a good time, A: Right. B: but I didn't have to have male companionship. A: Right, A: right. B: Um, and a lot of the, um, friends that I had in school at that point, who had gone back and gone to law school, or M B A programs, um, which I also had done, had just, you know, they were very sad. A: Uh-huh. B: But then by the time I got married, um, it seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: yeah, B: So, I guess that's a big change in terms of, just, um, the attachments that women feel like they need to have, the dependency, their self-identity is stronger. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: it's, it's just really not there anymore. B: Yeah. A: And that, that has to do with, you know, the women getting out and other women seeing, uh, women seeing other women, you know, out in the corporate world. B: Right. B: Uh-huh. A: That's like, oh, I can do that. A: You know, maybe, I don't need to get married. B: Right, B: and I, I, I mean, I don't know how, how old your mom is, B: she's probably, B: let's see my mother's in her early sixties, B: so. A: She's, she's about forty. B: Okay, B: I'm thirty-eight, B: your mother's B: I just turned thirty-eight. B: Um, yes B: I'm laughing, B: oh my God. B: It does start to creep up. A: Uh-huh. B: No, B: um, but it's okay, B: don't ever let age, B: I mean, I don't A: Okay. B: nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men. A: I, I just turned twenty-three, uh, April twentieth, B: Uh-huh. A: and I'm still going, you know, oh my God, I'm getting so old. A: I just, A: because me, myself, I just like to move really, really quickly. B: Yeah, B: an, A: I like to, A: anything I do, A: I got out of school quick. A: I'm, you know, I'm working quick. B: Uh-huh. A: I want to move up quick. A: I want to make money quick. A: I want to retire quick. B: Yeah. A: And so anything, A: when the age creeps up, where I'm twenty-three and twenty-four, I'm thinking my time is running out. You know, B: Uh-huh. A: but I'm actually very, very young. B: Yeah, B: you are, because what I was going to say is, what you will find is, my background is in journalism and corporate communications, A: Uh-huh. B: and what you'll find is, B: I mean, I'm just now finally to a point where, B: I mean I don't know why I didn't, didn't do it sooner, A: Uh-huh. B: but this is probably typical of the women's movement too, is the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway, if you want to go back to school. A: Uh-huh. B: I'm seriously considering going back to school for law. Um, which is a complete, I wouldn't say career change, it's, it's a subway , A: Um. A: Uh-huh. B: but it's still is a different application. B: And I mean, if you think about it, you know, I I still can have another career. B: I mean I've worked for over fifteen years in what I've done. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: And I mean, so when you're saying quick, um, I think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine, is thinking that, um, they have to do you know, sort of, I call kind of, I call it a chewing syndrome. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: They have to eat real fast B: they have, they have to, rapidity of speech, A: Uh-huh, A: exactly. B: they have to just go through everything. A: Exactly. B: And you'll find that probably by the time your twenty-eight, thirty, if you haven't slowed down, something will slow you down. A: Uh-huh. B: Do you know what I'm saying? A: Yeah, A: yeah, B: Um, because it's just, you find out that you're really not, um, smelling the roses, B: and I know that sounds trite, and all that. A: Yeah, A: I think, I think a lot of, uh, people probably feeling that way, A: I know, I'm probably feeling that way because it's, everything's geared towards young. You know B: Uh-huh. A: and whether I want to realize it or not, everything on television is young, young, young, young. B: Oh it is. A: You can't be a model after thirty, A: you can't do this after twenty, you know A: and, everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen. You know, B: That's right. B: Uh-huh. A: and so I feel like I'm old. A: It's like I sing, I sing A: and I would really love to become, uh, a professional singer, B: Uh-huh. A: but I think I'm too old now, B: Oh, you're not, B: no. A: and I'm twenty-three, B: No. A: because everyone I've seen coming up, they're fifteen. You know, B: That's true B: I mean, it's, it's, A: and so I'm going, I'm so old A: and I'm, I, I really have to always tell myself, no, you're not, you're very young. B: No, B: you're extremely, B: yeah, B: it's, it's A: And, you know, so it's, B: Well it's like us, we're getting ready to do, if possible, for an adoption B: and I have friends that say well why would you do that, if you know you haven't been able to children, which we do know, why would you do that now, at this part, point, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and, um, it's just individual choices. A: Yeah. B: I stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had, um, B: in my family my brother's children, A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, he just turned forty, B: his children will be out of high school before he's forty-five. A: Wow. B: Um, I mean that's like your mother, B: look how young she is, compared to where you are out of school and everything. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. A: Right. B: It's just, it, B: but what you find is you don't compare the woman, because you just get into trouble. B: It's all independent and choices. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah, A: very true. B: Um, but what I was going to say about mothers is, uh, your mother probably just won't say it, B: but, I mean, my mother and her sisters are always saying, uh, to my cousins and I, my female cousins, you girls are so lucky because quote, unquote, you have all these choices, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: you went to school, A: Right, A: uh-huh. B: you can do this, B: you can do that, A: Uh-huh. B: we couldn't do that then. B: And my cousins and I go, well why couldn't you A: Yeah, A: that's, that's why I say I feel, I feel really lucky right now, because I'm not married and because I don't have children. A: I'm out of school, A: I'm twenty-three, A: I can do anything I want to do, anything. B: Uh-huh. A: And so, I mean even some days I'm looking for another job now, A: but, and I get so depressed because, not because I can't find a job, but because I can't figure out what I want to do. B: And that's normal, B: I mean, I think that's the world today. A: And yeah, A: and I A: and I'm lucky though, because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee, I don't know what to do. A: I have so you know, B: Right B: that's A: not a lot of people, B: Yeah. A: but it's depressing too. B: That's how, I mean, What, I'm right now. A: What do you, what do you that you're, A: Uh-huh. B: I'm, I'm a free-lance writer right now. A: Oh. B: And then, um, what I'm doing is working at, um, a an electronics company, for their company newspaper, right now on the side, A: Uh-huh. A: Oh. B: and then I'm also, B: actually, I'm excited, tomorrow I have a, uh, luncheon appointment with a perspective client to do, uh, marketing communications for them. A: Huh. A: Huh, okay, A: I'm a, I'm a news reporter, now, B: Oh you are? A: and what I'm looking for is something in, I really don't want to stay in news, A: but I would like to stay in journalism, A: and I've been looking for something exactly like that B: Here's what you B: this is off the topic, B: and those people probably A: Uh-huh, A: okay B: Did you go to Baylor by any chance? A: No, A: I I went to U T at Austin. B: Oh, okay, B: that's even better. A: And I, I just happen to work at a Waco station, because you know. B: I went to, B: or you in radio, or television or news. A: broadcast news, T V, B: Uh, my journalism degree is in, B: Are you still there? A: Yes. B: Okay, B: it worked out fine. A: Okay. B: Well, we just ate out, um, had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late B: and we had Italian, um, B: have you ever been to the Olive Garden? A: No, A: I haven't, A: is that good? B: Yeah. B: Well, do you really like Italian food? A: it's not my favorite A: but, I like it's okay. B: Then don't, B: Then this will probably, B: I mean this isn't really excellent Italian food, A: Uh-huh. B: That sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great B: but it's, um, B: you're not going to believe this B: but I have to tell you this if I don't because you're in Plano, A: That's okay. B: but my, um, softball unit here is acting like he's dying of tramane poison B: It wasn't that bad, B: actually it's very good it's all of these run adult males, A: Uh-huh. B: which I'm not Italian, B: no, B: it's , it's all the garlic bread and all the, salads you can eat with an entree. A: Oh. A: Oh, that sounds really good. B: So it wasn't too bad it really wasn't B: but I was more in the mood for french toast any way B: so, so I really like Italian food though, A: Yeah. B: but do you have any favorite? A: Well are there just the two of you? B: Uh, yes, B: uh-huh. A: Okay, A: well, when my husband and I go out we have four children. B: Oh, you're kidding. A: So that makes a difference. A: For us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can, A: the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best. B: Oh, sure. A: But we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive, A: so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and feed the whole family, and like that. B: Yeah. B: You can usually get a variety of what you're looking for, like at Gatti's or something like that. A: Right. A: Right, A: but when my husband and I go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere A: and we usually head on down, um, oh what's the freeway down here? B: Uh, six thirty-five? A: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: And there are, um, all along that, that freeway there are restaurant A: but one of our favorites is Pappasito's. B: Oh, yeah, B: Pappasito's. A: No, A: we love to go there. B: We went there on my birthday in March it's great. A: You know it always kills me cause I don't like the, the decorations so much A: it's too, B: too much like a bar naturally, and Mexico, A: Yeah B: yeah, B: I know, B: I've seen it. A: But I love the food I love the food, B: The food is probably, A: the food is great. B: I'm not a I'm Mexican food gourmet by any means B: but it's probably the best tasting, B: I don't know would you classify that as Tex-Mex? A: Yeah, A: uh-huh. B: Um, the shredded beef the type of, spices or sauces they use. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh, A: I like to get that, uh, A: a shrimp it's a shrimp dish, B: Really. A: and I don't remember the name of it, B: Uh-huh. A: but it's rolled up into, into something, A: and oh, it's really good. B: I've never had anything there that wasn't delicious. A: Yeah, A: they are really good. B: Even though you have to stand in line and all of that, that's the only thing I don't like about it too B: it's a little bit with the meat market atmosphere, you know. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: Even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to, um, be around not be around that. A: Yeah. B: Um, I'm trying to think of what else we like to eat. B: The one thing I notice is it's just, um, about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt, I mean we find prohibited, just to cost any more? A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: I mean lunch today was eighteen dollars. A: Yeah, A: it's very expensive. B: Yeah, B: I don't know how you feel about that B: but I think that some of it's over priced. A: Yeah B: I'm glad I'm talking about food normally these conversations are A: Sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a, B: Yeah, B: it is I don't know, um, A: No, A: sometimes Mark and I, that's my husband Mark, um, go to the August Moon which is down there B: Uh-huh. A: it's a Chinese, uh, restaurant with the lions in the front, B: Oh, yeah, B: my husband likes that. B: yeah, B: off of Arapaho down there? A: yeah, A: and, Oh, it's pretty good as far as Chinese, B: Yeah, B: August Moon, B: uh-huh. A: but Chinese isn't my favorite A: so, B: I don't like it at all usually B: so A: But he likes it kind of A: so he heats us up a good fight A: now, me I'm like I said seafood I'm, A: I like that. B: Yeah, B: I love seafood, A: So. B: and I, I like a lot of different ethnic foods. B: I like Japanese food. B: There's a place on Greenville called Sagar's . A: Um. B: Well, we haven't been in years down near Presby , B: and I had a meeting down there today B: and I saw that B: and I said, gee I remember that they offer you, um, authentic Japanese feeding, or American or piano bar, A: Oh. B: and I remember when we went we were married with another couple that was just dating B: and, um, I had never had saki. A: Uh-huh. B: It made all raw fish tastes great B: but if you're looking for a very, uh, B: it's very pretty inside, A: Is it? B: and the girls wear kimonos and, You know, if you're ever looking for that. A: Oh, how nice. A: Yeah. B: Um, but what other kind of foods, B: gee I don't know B: we went to a place called Grishman's in Greenville, which was really over priced. A: I don't know that place. A: Was it? B: Uh-huh. B: They had a great desert bar. A: Um. A: That's what we need isn't it? B: Yeah. A: No, A: there's a lot of nice barbecue places here, A: now, I like barbecue okay, Texas barbecue. B: Yeah, B: I like, barbecue, A: It's good. B: have you ever been to I think it's called Spring Creek Barbecue? A: Yeah, A: now, they're real good. B: That's real good, B: Yeah. A: They are good. B: There had, B: oh my husband's going upstairs, B: and he says free ice cream A: Yeah, A: free ice cream, A: yeah. B: I didn't know they had that. A: Yeah. B: I can't talk I had chocolate bavarian tort, for desert, today, which I never eat at lunch A: Oh. B: and it was wonderful. A: Just to die for exactly. B: It was, A: Oh. B: in fact if I could pick my, um, restaurants on how their coffee is and how their french bread is and the butter and the desert I would be, yes, I would be in hog heaven. A: In heaven B: And how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want B: or do you still order for them? A: Well, my two littlest, A: I just had a baby, B: Oh, congratulations. A: and she's six months A: and then my four year old he, he still, A: but my other older two they can. A: So, they're they're kind of, B: Uh-huh. A: my littlest girl she's still like wants McDonald's, McDonald's, McDonald's B: Yeah, B: everybody, every child that I even know that eats vegetables, um, looked five years old still after a certain age realized that there is something called a McDonald's. A: Oh, I'm telling you. B: It's really sad isn't it cause it's hard to get them away from junk then. A: Well, it's kind of funny is sometimes we're like we all want different things, B: Uh-huh. A: and so there's a H Avenue down here, and along are these fast food restaurants B: Uh-huh, B: I know where that, B: Right B: that's all, A: So we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing, A: and then we go to park over there so we can all have our own. B: Well, that's all right as long as, A: that's on the nights we can't decide. B: I was going to say because with six people how do you, um, B: cause with two we have a problem, B: I mean I can't even imagine, you know, trying to, um, B: you sound like you're doing pretty well with four children. A: Well, five of them, they're good, kids. B: That's the way the, B: Yeah, B: well, we're getting ready to B: I shouldn't say this on this conversation, B: but it's just on my mind, B: we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt. A: Oh, how nice. B: Yeah, B: we're excited, A: It will be neat. B: I think it will be worth it B: and somebody said to me in terms of, B: this is food so I can say this, B: but they, you have to bring a formula, B: and I said what's that B: They laughed B: and I said well, you know, I'm. thirty something, A: Food's, food. A: Yeah. B: and I think that that would make them drool any way. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: You, know, I guess are you is it a little bit of constricted, because a lot of restaurants don't take, B: in terms of talking about restaurants, I mean are a lot of restaurants, how are they when you have children let alone three or four children? A: You have to be careful if you go to a, a restaurant that, that really is more adults you know, with the atmosphere and everything, B: Uh-huh. B: Sure. A: they, A: if you're, A: like we could probably take our oldest son and, and our oldest daughter. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And they know how to act, B: Yeah. A: I don't think I would chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a distraction A: and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing. B: That yuppie kind of crowd, yeah. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: So. B: I just, I just, I've been in some places where they say they take children, B: and then I've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude, you know. A: Yeah. B: And that always just bothered me B: and then, um, on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves A: Yeah B: I don't know what other kind of restaurants B: really Pappasito's we love, um, B: we went to one Italian, B: back on the Italian, we went to some place across from Collin Creek Mall that absolutely putrid for Italian food. A: Oh. B: I can't remember the name of it B: it's on, uh, A: Is it Tia's, not Tia's, um, B: No, B: that's Mexican, um, right across from on the Dillard's side there, A: Yeah, A: I know which one it is, A: and I can't think of it. B: I can't, B: yeah B: it's in the strip, yeah, B: and it had white tablecloth, B: I think it was like paper where you could write on them, or something with crayons B: it was just terrible. A: Oh dear. B: I mean I was shocked, B: I mean the dish was dirty, um, A: It was one of these you have bad experience and, say I don't think I'll come back here. B: Yeah, B: where you felt it's starting to really, you know, look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Like one of the guys I work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, the, the crime level there, of course, is quite a bit, quite a bit, uh, more pronounced, uh A: Uh-huh. B: but, uh, yeah. B: I guess, A: I mean, B: I think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis, B: I'm not real sure. Uh, A: Yeah, A: it helps to know your neighbors, you know. A: They give you, A: you're supposed to make lists of, uh, cars. A: Like I know a lot of my neighbors right around my development. If I see a car that's unfamiliar, we, we have a list A: is that what you, you did in your program? Where you have a list of license plates? B: Pretty much. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: I was, I was basically, involved in that, in the organization of it. A: Uh-huh. B: And then I left right in the middle of it. B: I'm not sure where we went from there, A: Oh, uh-huh. B: but, A: Yeah. Well. B: Yeah, B: that, that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings, noticing people who look suspicious uh, activities like that, sure. A: Uh-huh. A: I mean, you, you hate to be paranoid A: but there are really only so many things you can do. A: You can have the house alarm, uh neighborhood watch program, you know, uh, as a woman not go out at night B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: uh, you can do that which is what I choose to do. B: Yeah. B: One of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited A: Yeah. B: even, even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps, A: Uh-huh. B: it's against the law to do a lot of things, you know. B: They could basically, uh, B: when I was getting robbed down in Florida, I was really considering electrifying doors um, things like that like A: Uh-huh. A: That's, A: Uh-huh. B: they did in Miami that time. A: But it's not, uh, A: if you kill someone in your home, as long as they are in your home, it's considered self-defense though. B: That's not always true. A: It isn't? B: No. B: There was a, there was a case about two years ago where a guy knew he was going to get robbed A: Uh-huh. B: and essentially what he had done is set a, a a electrocution trap for the burglar in his own home. A: Uh-huh. A: Huh. B: The guy came in while he was home B: and, sure enough, he fell into the trap and was severely burned. B: He didn't die, B: but he was severely burned B: and he took the guy to court and won a settlement. A: Really. B: Yeah. B: So that really, that makes you think, you know. A: Yeah. B: It's like your hands are very much tied. A: Yeah. A: Well I think if, if you had a handgun though, in other words it wasn't premeditated, you had a handgun, it's the middle of the night, someone's A: Uh, I've had, uh, three boys through, I guess, uh, some child care, each one of them A: and now they're in school A: so it's all over A: but, uh, I guess I would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want. B: Well I can profit by this because I'm due with my first in about three months. A: Is that right A: I guess, uh, the only rule, uh, I can think of is that I like to look for places with, uh, good respectable, nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that. A: If they're associated with a college or a university, they're usually a pretty good bet. B: Huh. A: Uh, I think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something. A: You'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care. B: I guess not, B: I suppose you're absolutely right there. A: Yeah. A: For profit places, I would really look at them awfully carefully B: Uh-huh. A: but, uh, when I was when my kids were young, I was teaching at a university A: and, uh, the child care center associated with our university was quite good A: so I felt confident that they'd do right. B: Uh-huh. B: Of, B: aren't don't they kind of use them for, everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs? For their for their pet theories or some such thing? B: Yes. A: But, yeah, A: I suppose, uh, if you're, if there is a psychology department or an education department around, you might find you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another, A: I guess that's true. A: But, uh, I never had bad experience in that respect A: Of course, you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents, A: and they, you know, A: pretty good people B: Um. Well, the thing I really worry about is, uh, the sexual abuse cases you read about. A: Uh-huh. B: And I mean you'd just feel awful if something like that happened. A: Yeah. A: I never really worry very much about it. A: I tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public A: so, I never really worried too much about that being, uh, uh, the case with my boys. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: Uh, I, you know, I think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them A: but B: Uh-huh. A: I don't think it's as common as, uh, the newspapers would make you believe B: Uh-huh. B: And another thing is cost. A: Oh, yeah A: I mean that, B: I know so many of my friends I went to school with who are having babies right now B: and they finding, in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare. A: Right. B: Um. A: Well, in our case, we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were, uh, in school. A: And I'm really happy we did it, although it was very, very difficult. A: And I think it was the right thing to do B: Um. A: and we were, uh, we just decided that we would do it A: and we went ahead A: but, uh, not everybody can make that choice A: and even, even though my wife wasn't working, we did have, uh, one or another of the boys in, uh, child care for just for part of the day. Uh, or a couple of days a week just so that, uh, other things could get done around the house and so on, A: so, So, we did look around. B: Huh. A: I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not A: and, uh so I would always trust her judgment on that. B: Huh . B: Huh. Well I'm just thanking heaven. B: My husband just got a new job. B: His last company, he was only working four days a week. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's, B: and he just got a new job. B: He's getting lots of overtime, B: he got a pay raise B: and so I'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not. A: There's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid A: so, yeah, do it as long you can B: I suppose. A: But I think, you know, you have to look through a place A: and you have to get a feel for, uh, how they treat the kids and, uh, uh, what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And I think you have, the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open. That you're welcome anytime without notice, in the middle of the day and so forth A: and if they're at all queasy about that then I'd look elsewhere, yeah. B: You have to start wondering if they don't want you. B: Yes. A: Right B: Huh. A: You have other friends that have kids, uh, being taken care of in, uh, child care? B: Uh, I have one B: but I haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while. A: Uh-huh. A: So. But, I really think the news reports are, uh, tend to sensationalize the problems. B: Uh-huh. A: I think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and, uh, pay and exhaustion and you know, things like that, rather than these, uh, uh, really wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy. B: This is true. A: Yeah. B: CURRENT AFFAIR can get several shows child cases. A: Uh-huh. Well, A: Why don't you go ahead and start. B: Okay. B: Well I think the court systems could stand some improvement. B: Uh, trial by jury is good B: but a lot of time a lot of cases, uh, is circumstantial evidence that, that convicts a person, which I don't think is all the time good. Because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent, I mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness. B: And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me. B: I don't know. A: So you think if, if trials were held by judges or experts, that they, they would tend not to, uh, admit, not to convict people on circumstantial evidence? B: I think so. A: You know, I, I attended a trial in, uh, Germany when I was a student A: and, uh that's the sort of system they have. B: Uh-huh. A: The trials are held by a panel of three, uh, three or four judges who are, well, A: they're like lawyers I guess. A: They're experts in the law B: Right. A: and, uh, there, there really isn't a jury A: and, uh, uh, they do the questioning also. A: The judges do the questioning A: and, uh they, B: Uh-huh. A: uh, A: I think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they, uh, uh, the judge is also sort of a jury, uh, A: but I'm not sure I like that A: I think I prefer the jury system myself. B: You think you prefer the jury? B: You think your chances are better? A: Uh, well, actually I think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury A: What, what I worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual. A: That's where you really need a jury of peers. Because, uh, anytime the government, uh, is the government against the individual you need you need the protection of ordinary citizens. B: Well, that's true. A: I think that's really the only thing. I guess where I would like to see the system change is, uh, uh, there ought to be a, a well A: I guess I don't think that, uh, uh, juries need to decide sentencing all the time. B: Uh-huh. A: I think maybe a judge is a better judge of that A: or, uh, B: Well, sometimes the sentencing is still, is not fair. B: I mean even if, well the jury, I guess they do decide that B: but, but, I'm like you, B: in a case like that, most of the time its, B: I don't know, B: maybe I'm too, too, uh, uh, conservative when it comes to that. B: the sentencing is really light compared to what I think they should be in a lot of cases you know, uh, A: Yeah. A: Well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, I trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent. A: That's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe. B: Right. A: But people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are, to ask them to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see, I think that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive. B: Yeah. A: In Texas here, people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people. B: Uh-huh A: Uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere B: Right. A: But in a lot of places, I think people bend over the other way, A: but I guess, I guess I like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's, goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it. A: Some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that. B: Oh really? A: I kind of like that system. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: That's, that's not a bad system. B: But I, I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit. A: Yeah. B: But, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, I don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in. A: Yeah. A: Right. A: And lawyers blow sand in their eyes. B: exactly. A: I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries. B: Right, B: exactly. A: Insurance cases and things like that. B: Yeah. A: Where A: and, uh, there would be more honest settlements instead of this, uh, tugging of people's heart strings and, uh making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering B: Uh-huh B: Exactly B: exactly. A: So. In, I think, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government A: but, A: Have you had that experience recently? B: Recently, I can't really say recently. B: But I think about, uh, about a year ago, uh, I bought a product from some company down at, uh, in Atlanta, Georgia. B: I believe it was one of these, uh, one of these, uh, mixers. These, like these juice machines B: and, uh the, uh, the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine, it looked, you know, perfectly okay A: Oh, yeah. B: but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting uh, after, A: Oh. B: even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use. B: And I don't think it was my fault because I, you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it B: but, uh, it was really, uh, it was, B: I had to send it back after like, you know, the third week because I realized it was like, it was not, B: something was very, very wrong with the blade. B: Uh, what about you? A: Well, I don't have so much trouble with products as service. B: Uh-huh. A: I don't feel like that's as big a problem. A: I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly. B: Uh-huh. A: And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, the one I have now is okay, most of the time. B: Uh-huh. A: But that's it. A: But that's, that's probably the worst. A: My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed. Uh, James Avery. A: I don't know if you have that up there A: but it, it's a very good company. That sells sterling silver things B: Uh-huh. A: and uh, she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it, a lot of money into it by now B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: and the catch broke A: and she was sitting in school on a carpet A: and when she stood up, it caught and broke A: and we took it back A: and they said oh, this was just obviously yanked. B: Uh-huh. A: This was yanked. A: I mean they were so rude about it. B: Right. A: And so we wanted a different kind of catch A: and she said well it's not guaranteed. A: And I said, well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed A: so do it anyway. B: Uh-huh. A: So we got the kind we wanted A: and I was really disappointed with that. A: I felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable B: Uh-huh. A: and I happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends A: and I called there to see if they had it A: and the lady was very nice. A: And I said my goodness, A: I said you've been very nice, what's your name. A: And she told me A: and I said well I really appreciate it. A: I said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that, store A: and it turned out she was the assistant manager A: so, A: Right. A: So I felt kind of good about that, you know. A: I didn't even know the person's name that had given me the hard time or anything B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: but I just felt like, well at least I did something. A: Maybe they'll fix it. A: They might work on that, you know. B: Right, B: right. A: But I find attitudes are more of a problem. A: Service is more of a problem. B: I find, B: up here in the northeast, we have, uh, well we have these mail order companies like L L Bean B: and, uh, they are famous for, I guess, having really top-notch service. B: They've got, uh A: Really. B: I mean I've, I've, I, I have friends and family who order from them because you can, you can literally, I've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year, wear it for a year and a half, B: and even after, like eighteen months of, you know, reasonably satisfactory use, they will accept it in any condition B: and they will gladly, no questions asked, take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore. B: Uh, they'll, they'll actually do things like this. B: I mean they're really, they, they bend over backwards service wise for you. B: I've, uh I've found also a lot of companies nowadays, have, they have eight hundred numbers you can call. A: That's really great. B: I guess if, if you call the any eight hundred number, uh, if, you, you can call up any eight hundred number directory assistance, and you can get, uh, the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies. B: And, um, actually I've tried that with a few companies lately. B: And they've, most of them have been pretty good, B: but I, I was, B: one reason why, I, like I buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that, uh, if you buy through Bean or though, B: uh, I guess Bean's, one of Bean's big competitors is Land's End out in, uh, I guess it's Wisconsin somewhere. B: They, they are, uh, they're very good about uh, A: Huh. B: like the customer is always right B: and you know, no matter how crabby you might be over the phone, they are very understanding B: and, uh, they usually get, you know, they, they make things are, they make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise. A: That's really good. A: It use to be like that. B: Uh-huh. A: But, A: I don't think most places are like that anymore. B: Well I think, I guess nowadays with the, uh, with the economy the way it is, I guess, B: there was a, there was a story on the news tonight about how, because a lot of companies are, uh, you know, B: things are getting rough out there, B: there's a lot of, you know, B: the morale among employees tends to go down and that, in turn, like, you know, A: Well, the question was talking about the juries A: and, uh, one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having, that, especially for repeat offenders that, uh, A: maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again. A: Uh, so that, uh, a judge, I think, would be the most appropriate person to, uh, to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day. Right. *slash error should be 'aa' B: Right. B: I, I kind of agree with that, because I think in some cases, uh, the jury may not even have, the information about other crimes the person has committed. B: Uh, I, I think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case A: Right B: so a judge, you're right, should have the whole dossier of the criminal there A: Uh-huh. B: and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate, uh, sentencing. A: Yeah. A: See I agree with you. A: Uh, one thing I heard was this, where they have, instead of going to the regular court, they have a, a mock court. A: I mean, it's supposed to be all legal and everything. A: Uh, you go A: and you present your case, A: the other side presents their case A: and you're done with it. A: It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, and, uh, but it's not that we have, uh, such, A: it didn't backlog or all of the, uh, the cases that are, uh, all ready pending. A: Uh, so I, A: that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way. B: In other words, not, not, B: there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial? A: Yes. A: Now, B: I, I, I don't, B: there's a point on which we don't agree. A: Uh-huh. B: I would tend, myself, to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a, anytime a, one of the parties wants one. A: Uh-huh. B: And I, usually it is the defendant, I guess, that wants to have the jury hear the case. A: Sure. B: So I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we, uh, take that, you know, B: that would require a change in the Bill of Rights, I believe B: and so, A: and, and I wasn't, I didn't mean that B: Oh, oh, okay. A: I, I didn't mean that, no. A: Because, I mean, gee whiz, if I was, uh, uh, didn't have that right, you know, not to have a jury that, oh A: yes, I would feel, uh, you're right, that my civil rights had been violated. A: But I meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going to have a judge here. A: We're not going to have a jury, you know, A: let's get it over with. A: Sort of like car accidents, you know, B: Right. B: Well I think that's all ready possible. A: Yeah. B: I think, that you can waive the right to a, jury trial uh, B: yeah A: right B: so. I agree that that should be encouraged. A: Uh-huh. B: People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial. B: But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to, to clients unless they feel they can, you know, tweak a jury into giving a different sentence or possibly, if it's a civil case, giving higher, uh, you know, awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the, the award. A: Right. A: Giving a different sentence. A: Uh-huh. A: The take. A: Right. B: Yeah. B: And I suspect it, in cases like, B: I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though, rather than civil. B: Is that right? A: Well, I, I, we're at liberty to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme. B: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: Well, uh, in the case of, civil, uh, things, I think maybe the, the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage B: and I think that may be where jury use is overdone, B: I mean there are cases where they could be settled, maybe out of court a little more efficiently. A: Right. B: But the lawyers are really, uh, B: it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible B: so. Uh, I was wondering too, if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in, in a criminal cases. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that. B: But I am in favor of it for criminal cases B: so there's a difference of my view there for those two. A: Right. A: Right. A: Yeah, A: well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that B: Have you ever had to serve jury duty? A: well I was called once when I was nineteen B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me A: and, I was doing school and things like A: they, they let me out. B: Uh-huh. A: I've never had to it since A: and that was almost twenty years ago B: Uh-huh. B: It isn't, B: sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time, in, uh, B: that would have been about, uh, twenty years too B: uh, uh, just last year B: and, uh, the case I heard was a criminal case B: and it seemed it really, trivial. B: It involved two bicycles. B: We didn't do the sentencing. B: The judge did. A: Huh. B: So A: How interesting. B: we, we rendered a verdict B: and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing. A: Uh-huh, A: Uh-huh B: And that was here in Wisconsin. B: So I, I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it, A: I'm Nevin from Sunnyvale, California. B: Hi, B: this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis, Minnesota. B: How you doing? A: Pretty good. B: Good. B: Uh, I guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how we would change it. A: Yep. B: Uh, I'm ready whenever you are. A: Okay B: So, uh, what are your, what are your thoughts on the subject there? A: Well I definitely think, like decisions have to be unanimous. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I think that's probably a good thing. A: It's probably the safest thing. B: Yeah. B: I mean, it's to easy to get a quorum A: Yep B: and simple majority won't do. A: No. A: And even like, you know, two-thirds majority, I mean, it's B: Yeah, B: that's, B: yeah, B: quorums are to easy to get. A: Yep. B: And there's always that, that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason, you know. B: So it's, it's B: definitely B: but, uh, I don't know. B: I could, I couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing. A: Yeah. A: Like Gives them a little too much power B: Yeah B: I, I know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that. Or arguing against that pretty vehemently. B: But, uh, A: Plus, you know, you may be, you know, doing, you know, a, a guilty verdict A: but it may not be, you know, it may be for technical reasons B: Yeah. B: About the only good thing I would say about that is it that it would, uh, hurry the process up a bit A: Yeah. B: but I mean even now we've got, I know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that B: and that's what the trial by jury. A: I know . B: I mean, jeez if, if the judge was doing it himself, without any checks and balances whose to say. A: Yeah. A: It, A: there would be much more of that B: Yeah B: no doubt. B: Are you involved in the legal system at all? A: No. A: But I . I tend to follow it just to, just to know what's going on. B: Okay. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: I've got some friends that are lawyers B: so. A: Yeah, A: I do too A: so. B: One of them just got his law degree. B: But, uh, to tell you the truth, I'm not real familiar with, uh, the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now. A: No. B: I really haven't studied it in depth. A: Yeah. A: I know a little more about civil cases when, than criminal cases. Which is, B: Yeah. A: it's more in how you present it versus, you know, who's right. B: I'm sure of it. B: Because a lot of those things, it's all, it's in, it's largely a matter of viewpoint. And who can argue their case better. A: Yep. B: Uh, it's kind of weird. B: I don't know, B: you I always think about watching the PEOPLE'S COURT or something. And how weird those cases get. B: It's just, B: Yeah. A: like, you know, you go say okay, we can't bring up this point because then they're going to, you know, A: the opposition will say this, this and this and B: Uh-huh. B: And it's like, boy, the stuff that they can twist around is, A: Yep B: it's pretty amazing. A: And it's like the, the truth isn't really important anymore. A: It's, B: Yeah, B: it's not. B: And then you get people who, who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because. A: Yep. B: Like this, this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious B: and he really gets into suing people. B: And so he'll, he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court, and argue his case you know, It is. It's, it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else. *aa,sv A: but, B: But, uh, A: Yeah A: but it's for the more general, A: people don't want to take responsibility. B: Yeah. A: You know, it's, B: And, and most of the time they're looking to place blame. Uh and stuff. A: Yep B: See, you're from California, B: is that right? A: Uh, yeah. A: Well originally from Chicago A: but, B: Oh, okay. B: I was just thinking B: I wonder, I wonder how, how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where I am in Minneapolis. A: I really, B: From what I understand, it's all pretty the same except when you get to Louisiana. B: And Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the, B: what is it, B: it's based on common law B: and the rest of the country is not or something like that. A: Yeah. B: Pretty strange. B: But, uh, fortunately I never have had to go in even, even for jury duty. A: Yeah, A: I haven't either other than, B: But, uh, that friend of mine's telling me that I might have to go in for, uh, as a witness. B: He may subpoena me. B: So we'll see what happens. B: But, uh, A: I'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better. . B: Yeah. B: It's, B: there are too many big problems, you know. B: There's, there's such a backlog of court cases right now. You know, to try to get them all in in a good time A: I know. B: and we already have too many lawyers as it is. A: Yeah. A: And if it's criminal cases we, you can't put them in jail because there's no room left. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: that's true. B: And, in fact, they're even letting some go. A: Yeah. B: I, I, I'm originally from Florida B: and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just cause they don't have room for them, you know. A: Huh. B: That's not a, that's not a good solution either. A: Not at all. B: I'm not real sure what the, A: What do you think about capital punishment? B: Well, I'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes. A: Yeah. A: Which crimes do you feel that? B: Well, I think first degree murder, uh, probably warrants it. A: Yeah. A: Because of, A: so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent B: Right. A: selling, I think should also. B: Exactly. B: Recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever. A: Yeah B: I come from a state that has, well I originally come from the state that has, uh, the death penalty. B: I come from Florida. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, they're pretty liberal on it. B: They tend to, like, fry people left and right. which, A: Yeah A: that's, B: go ahead. A: Go ahead. A: Texas is too. A: Texas, I saw on T V the other night, is the, has had forty-six in like the past several years. B: Yeah. A: So they're pretty hip on it too, I guess. A: They do it by lethal injection, at Huntsville. B: Yeah, B: okay. B: I think Florida still uses electric chair. A: Yeah B: Uh, I don't, I don't know. B: In some ways I don't like it because it's like they're playing God. A: Yeah. B: And that's not, B: I don't think that's right. B: But on the other hand, there's a lot of advantages to it. A: Yeah. B: I think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it B: and, of course, you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not. Um, A: Yeah. B: with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year. B: They, A: Yeah. A: That's what's happening here. A: There is, A: like, uh, that's, A: in fact, a big gubernatorial issue is the the turnover rates of, uh, uh, repeat offenders being let out and doing it again. B: Uh-huh. B: Sure. B: And it's like, you know, that's a big problem B: but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build A: Uh-huh. B: and it's really, you know, it's, it gets to be a a big problem. A: Yeah. B: Uh, go ahead. A: I wish if they were going to do it, they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't. B: Right. A: Be a little more, you know, A: not being able to put it off for fifteen years. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: Because a lot of these guys, you know, they get in B: and they, they get off for good behavior B: and, I don't know, B: up in Minnesota where I am now, they don't have the death penalty. B: And you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system, you know. Because they figure well, you know, sure I, I get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something. B: Uh, but then for, B: if I, if I elicit good behavior I'm out in maybe five or ten. A: Oh, really? B: Oh, sure, you know. A: Goodness. B: I mean just because, like we said before, they don't have enough room in the jails uh, you know, there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: But if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head, uh, B: I don't know, B: I think that may solve a lot of that. A: Yeah B: Maybe not solve it, B: but, I don't know, B: maybe , A: I, yeah I tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little, little too lenient. B: Yeah. A: Uh, kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty. B: Uh-huh. B: What do you do Georgeanne? A: I'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas. B: Oh, okay. B: Great. B: What program you in? A: Uh, audiology. B: Okay. B: Fantastic. Uh A: Yeah. A: What do you do? B: I'm a doctoral student at the University of Central Florida. A: Oh, really. B: Yeah, B: I'm doing an internship up at Honeywell. A: Oh really? B: Uh, yeah. A: Neat. B: But, uh, I don't know. B: It's, it's an interesting issue. B: There's, like you say, in Texas there's been quite a few B: and, and in Florida in the last few years, I think there's been a lot. B: I can't, I, you know, I can't give you figures B: but, uh, A: Yeah. A: I just, A: this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in California. B: Uh-huh. A: So, I think it, A: the forty-sixth in the last twenty-five years I think is what B: Oh, is that right? A: they gave a run down that Texas Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then . B: Okay. B: Yeah, B: I, I kind of, B: yeah, I've heard things about that. B: I've heard that they don't mess around very much. A: Yeah. A: Uh, they, they don't get repealed as easily as they do. A: Like the guy in California got you know, twice before he went to the gas chamber A: and then they said okay, no, A: you don't have to go. A: And then they took him back. A: I mean, it just seems, Yeah, it just seemed a little inconsistent. B: Jeez, B: that's a lot of repeals. A: And then you have like two, A: you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when ever you know. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: I don't know. B: I, I'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it. B: Uh, I guess, B: what is it, what's the policy now with treason? B: Do they, uh, do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence? A: No, A: I don't, I don't think, uh, the military doesn't execute anymore A: so. B: Yeah. A: Or death before the firing squad or whatever. B: Yeah. A: So, I think about the only one is, uh, rape, A: Okay, A: I'm here. A: How do you feel about public schools? B: Well, our public schools are, are really poor, I feel. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation B: but, uh, we're toward the bottom. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, there's a lot of things that I see that are so obviously wrong. That you would think it would be easy to correct. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: But the system doesn't allow for the corrections A: Uh-huh. B: How about you? A: Well, that's interesting. A: I have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw, Georgia. B: Oh, yes. A: And, uh, she has a young boy. Actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there. A: And she complained quite a bit about their school system there. B: Yes. A: And, B: And Cobb County is better than the county I'm in. A: Right. B: She was in Cobb County. A: Right. A: I'm, A: I can't really say much about the schools up here. A: I really don't come from here B: Uh-huh. A: I'm only up here temporarily on an internship A: but uh, I live in Orlando, Florida usually. B: Okay. A: And the schools down there, from what I know, are not bad. A: They're pretty good. B: Well, that's great. A: But I know that in some, I know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good. B: Uh-huh. A: For example, I have a brother in North Carolina A: and he says the schools there are, are incredibly bad. Uh, just terrible. B: Well, I feel that we're way behind. B: Uh, I have a son that is in the fourth grade A: Huh. B: and, uh, they have just now taken up division. A: Wow. B: Yeah B: And A: That is slow. B: uh, B: my husband and I go to the store B: and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication, division things B: and I feel like, uh, there are several areas that we're just really, really slow in. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, I don't blame the teachers as much as I blame the system. B: It is, A: What do you think's wrong to cause that? B: Well, well, for one thing there's not enough money in the school system. B: And the money they do have, they're not, they do not use it wisely. A: Yeah. B: Uh, she, my son's teacher has twenty-seven students. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal with on an every day basis. Uh A: Yeah. A: Perhaps. B: but more than that, I don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children. A: Yeah. B: And when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty to do something about it, other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office. It it, you know, it can, it can really be bad. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: that's, that's one thing I worry about . B: Uh, also I think, we have a lot of, uh, Hispanics A: There you go, A: uh-huh. B: and we have a lot of, uh, B: the county I am, I'm in, the minorities are mostly Hispanic. A: Yeah. A: Probably quite a few black people up there A: and and, B: No B: We're from a county, we're from the county they marched in. B: We're in Forsyth county A: Oh, is that right? B: yes, B: and we, B: and there's very, very few blacks. A: Oh, okay. B: Uh, so, so that's, uh, B: I, I hate to say, uh, B: it's not a problem, uh, because I hate to feel like they are a problem, although they are. A: Yeah A: but, you know, it, it's, A: you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever, A: but then again. B: But it is a problem Uh, especially in the inner schools, inner city. A: Yeah, A: there is no denying that, that, A: Sure, you know. A: Teachers, you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand, especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school. B: Well, B: and you can't put all the children in special education. A: That's right, A: you can't do that. B: Uh, and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know. A: Right. A: See, I grew up in Nebraska B: Uh-huh. A: and the school that I went to there was fantastic. A: It, A: I, I really consider myself very, very lucky. A: Uh, we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking, twenty-seven, thirty kids to to a class. B: Yeah. A: But, B: But your teacher had control. A: Yeah. A: We zipped right along, you know. A: I, I was, I was doing mathematics, fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade, easily. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. B: I, I believe I was too. A: Uh, A: Uh-huh. A: But, you're right, you know. A: With all this, don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights, you've also taken something away from the discipline, I think. B: Uh-huh B: Uh, well, it, it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it, my son would be in private school. A: Yeah. B: We just cannot afford it. A: Right. A: I was going to ask you if there, if that was an option. B: Uh, if, A: Uh, I'm of the age that could have gone, although I didn't A: and, uh, I guess, uh, looking back on it, I tend to think it was pretty, uh, mostly a mistake. B: Uh-huh. A: On the other hand, uh, the more I learn about the history, the more I see it was incremental, uh, decisions. Any one of which was sort of understandable at the time. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, but on the whole I think it, uh, probably was the wrong thing to do. A: How about you? B: Well, I'm, uh, I, I was just, uh, in high school I guess when it, when it ended. A: Uh-huh. B: Ended up being, B: I was in the last, last lottery. A: Yeah. B: And I was glad it was over by then. A: Right. B: I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there. B: Just because, you know, we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like. A: Yeah. B: You know, we, uh, B: those people that I know, B: I work with several that were over there, B: and for some of them it was just kind of, I don't know, not so much a holiday, B: I guess that's how they tend to talk about it. But that they just kind of lived out in the woods B: and ever now and then, they'd go and shoot their rifles B: and then they'd, come back B: and you know. B: But that they weren't really allowed to do anything. B: I, uh, B: to me it seems like we only went halfway. If even halfway. A: Yeah, A: it's funny. A: Tonight I was, uh, helping my kid with an essay on, uh, Stalin. A: And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, uh, in World War Two, the personalties of Stalin, Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war A: and actually when you think back on the big events of the war, it was, uh, it was almost a personal struggle among these three, uh, A: I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, they're certainly all leaders A: and, uh, and, uh, with their nations pretty, pretty solidly behind each one of them. B: Yeah. A: And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, uh, early decisions of the Vietnam war. That the, uh, people saw the cold war as, uh, you had to draw a line and, and defend it. A: Otherwise there'd be, they'd get you someplace else. B: Uh-huh. A: Looking back, it seems like that was only partly true. That, uh, there might have been a better place to draw the line A: Uh, I guess you can, I guess you can say that a, a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight, uh, brought the cold war to an end. A: But I don't think you can just fight anywhere just, just in order to, uh, call the bully out and beat him. A: And I have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war. A: They felt like this was a place where we could draw a line, beat them and they wouldn't come forward. A: And, uh we were wrong A: But I, uh, you know, A: the, like I said, the more I hear about it, the more I can see each decision that was made as being understandable. A: But the accumulative effect was to really get into a, a hopeless situation where, A: and as you say, uh, going halfway was probably worse than, uh, committing, uh, committing to a completely and, uh, winning it, whatever that would mean. B: Yeah. B: Well, I, I, I think we did, I think we did learn some lessons that we weren't, uh, we weren't prepared for, B: I guess the best word would be the atrocities of war. A: Yeah B: Uh, I mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war. I mean they seemed like a valiant thing. A: Yeah. B: You knew, you knew who was good. B: You knew who was bad. A: Yeah. B: And it was a, it was a traditional the traditional battle of, kind of good versus evil, if you, you know whichever way it is. A: Well you're not, B: But in, in the Vietnam war it seems like it was, B: a, a, the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who's good and who's bad B: and and, uh, you know, the, A: It's ambivalent, A: yeah. B: even, B: it seems like even the people, you know, B: had the South Vietnamese, the North Vietnamese and, of course, the Laotians B: and the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved. B: But, A: What, what about the domestic effects A: like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it, uh, possible and even popular to, uh, criticize the government. A: And they, A: that pendulum started to swing, uh, maybe even too far. To the point where, uh, uh, supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: And that tradition is still, A: I mean it's dying now, A: but it's still alive as opposed to, A: this Desert Storm stuff may have, uh killed it. B: Yeah. A: But I think that was one of the biggest, A: that, you know, the, uh, the domestic unrest, A: Are you in the middle of anything? B: No. B: I'm not in the middle of anything. B: I've just, B: about the last thing I did B: about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now I guess, I, I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house. B: So, I guess that, A: The whole thing? B: Yeah. B: That, that was fairly large undertaking. B: A, a, it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house. A: Did the framing and all? B: Oh, we did it all except for the sheetrocking. A: Huh. B: That was the only thing we didn't, you know, putting the ceiling up and things like that B: we don't, we, we weren't sure how to do that B: and. A: and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work B: Yeah, B: that's the exact opposite. B: We did all, put the roof up and did all the roofing and the, put all the interior walls up. B: We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work B: and that's it because you have, you know, get those joints to go together B: and whatever you have to put in there to get the, to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that. A: Yeah. B: I we didn't know a thing about any of that B: and so, It's, it looked very hard to do A: My wife wishes I hadn't done that. B: so, B: we figured well just, B: I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional. B: So, we left it, left it to somebody who does it for a living. B: But, A: I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy. Yeah *should be 'b' B: Probably so B: and I, we'd never done it B: so we just left it alone. B: But that's, B: I guess, I'm only twenty-one B: so I, my, my vast experience of home, home owner's knowledge is not very much. B: So it's just what I have to do, more or less, around the house, you know, for my parents B: so. A: Did you, you framed it in uh, on, on, you framed in new square footage A: or was it stuff that was already, uh, enclosed? B: It was brand new. A: Brand new . B: We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house B: so it was, A: and you knew how, you knew how to do the framing? B: Uh, well my dad knew how to do most of it, you know. A: Uh-huh. B: He, he'd, we'd gotten a couple of books B: and then he just started doing it. B: I don't know. B: He, well he did all the flooring himself. B: He put the whole, the whole floor in B: and then I just started with the walls and the roof and started there. B: And then we were, put a, like a, not, not necessarily a garage, but just like a, off the side of that B: after we had the house part made, we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less. B: It's not, you know, it's not enclosed. B: It's just somewhere to drive another car to, to park B: and it's, A: Do, do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground? B: Uh, it's off the ground. A: On the piers? B: Uh-huh. B: It's on about uh, twenty-two inch piers, something like that. A: Did, A: You had those poured B: So. A: or you did them yourself? B: Uh, no, B: those, those are, B: we did those ourselves B: so. A: You just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete? B: Yeah. A: Huh. B: Exactly, B: so. It's, A: Well, the last thing I did completely myself was an outside deck which I was pretty proud of B: Yeah, B: those those are, B: we'd, I've done one, B: I helped somebody do one of those before. B: Those are, those are, you know, B: you can buy them in kits B: but we didn't do that way. B: But it's, A: No A: I designed it from scratch and did it did a pretty good job. B: Yeah. A: Those are nice. A: They're pretty forgiving, you know. A: You can always tear stuff out and redo it. A: It's a, B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: That's not near, like building a house or anything B: but, B: Yeah, B: those are nice. B: Especially when you get done, you've got something, you know. B: I don't know, B: I like them. B: You just sit down on on the deck and do whatever. Have a barbecue A: Yeah. A: I I built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and, uh, a backrest and all that stuff. B: or, A: I, B: Yeah, B: that sounds nice. B: All done by yourself, huh? A: I had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes B: Designed, A: so we could pour concrete and support it with a, a nice firm four by four posts. A: And, uh and then the rest of it I just did. B: Yeah. A: A, a contractor friend helped me, uh, with some of the, uh, foundation work A: but, uh, it was pretty, A: it was about four or five hundred square feet. A: The same size as the addition that I just put on A: so. B: Yeah. B: That's pretty, that's a good size deck. A: Yeah. B: So, yeah. B: That's, A: It's, uh, not that expensive. A: I think it cost me three dollars a square foot and, uh, you know, no less than that. B: Yeah. B: That's not, A: cost me about five hundred dollars, six hundred dollars all together. B: Yeah, B: that's good. B: That's not bad at all. B: Didn't have to, A: Yeah. B: the wood may B: it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is, you know. B: To get, to get good lumber it costs, B: I don't know about Dallas, but even in this little town, it's, it's not cheap at all. B: I was surprised. A: I'd be surprised if it wasn't, uh, cheaper where you are. B: It's probably more there. A: Well, yeah. A: It probably comes from where you are. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: that it probably does. A: Most B: I, I'm not sure B: but, A: When I drive through that area, that's all I see is pressure treated, pressure treated lumber yards. live there to work. A: They wouldn't. A: Their jobs are there for Costa Ricans. A: They don't allow people to move in, like less nations, you know, B: They don't, they don't probably take a lot of refugees from other countries either. A: take the job. A: No A: they don't take any. A: I mean I couldn't even go there. A: My husband had to receive all this special permission to go, A: so even with, uh, you know, in, uh, inner company, you know, transfer, or something, A: and I have another friend in, uh, Costa Rica that, A: she was born there. A: She's Costa Rican. A: I guess I do know a little bit. A: I went to Mexico City one time and stayed. A: I have been there twice and stayed A: and, that, aw, that was just really sad. A: But, a lot of it though is their debt. A: I think that we should not loan them anymore money, A: that if we still want to give them money, give them money, quit loaning it to them. A: You're not going to get it back. A: Don't be indebted to anybody. A: Don't be the loaner or borrower. A: It's just not good. A: We need to, if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them, A: but quit loaning all the money out. A: Which I don't think we are loaning anymore now, A: but that's how we got into a problem. A: If we got, the, A: we have, we went in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars. A: That's common sense, A: you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back. B: Yeah B: also, uh, uh, Mexico, uh, we will loan the money in uh, B: a lot of the higher, the higher people, were just stealing it and, building these beautiful homes, and nice ranches and things. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. A: Uh-huh. B: So we are, we're suckers. A: Yeah, A: we, we are, it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money, A: that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them. A: You don't loan money to people like that. A: I mean if you feel like you need to give them something to help them out, fine, A: but you don't go making billions of dollars of loans in, to people that you can just look at the situation, B: They know they're not going to pay it back. A: Yeah, A: and know that they are going to be capable of paying us back, A: and that puts a bondage on them. A: It makes, you know, pressure on the nation, and on the people, and on the leadership, and makes their inflation go up, A: and it's just a big mess. B: Did you go to Mexico City, uh, anywhere near when the earthquake hit. A: No, A: but I knew people, A: I was there before that, A: but I knew people, A: I got a letter from a friend of mine that I had met there, that who, who the apartment building was destroyed A: and they were living in a tent, A: so it's kind of weird, you know. A: To these people who were on U S dive, the Mexican diving, we went to the pool together, and watched them dive and all this, A: so they were you know, just normal people, weren't squatters or poor people or anything that, uh, A: I did, I knew all of my friends there, A: but none of them that I know of, got killed in it. A: But, uh, they're all Christians though. A: God really protected them. A: See that broke out a revival in Mexico City. That C B S news and A B C never told you about. A: There's been a real revival in Mexico City since that earthquake, because there's a lot of, you know there's a lot of sin in those nations and a lot, lots of witchcraft, a lot of witchcraft. A whole lot of witchcraft. So, a lot of it in the name of Christianity. B: Oh, I can imagine. B: Oh, really. A: Oh, yeah. A: There's a lot, you know A: they call themselves Christians, A: but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff, and just a whole lot of the generational things too, like the Mayans and the Incas. A: You can't find a trace of them because God totally destroyed them for how wicked they were. A: And yet, they are revered and honored and almost worshiped by A: so many people, A: even now in America, you know, we wouldn't know the truth with all of Indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth, because of how wicked they were. A: I've been down to the pyramids A: and I have climbed to the top of the pyramid where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy, A: and they hold it up to the sun God, A: and that's pretty of heavy duty. B: Yeah, B: is, is there still blood stains on the altar B: or has it worn away through the years? A: I don't think so. A: The little box is black on the top of the pyramid in the sun. A: It's black, A: so A: yeah, A: you can't really tell, A: but it was kind of weird, you know, A: you think, wow there is where they did sacrifices to false Gods. B: Do you get spooked, you feel, B: or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there? B: Because, A: Uh, at that time, I kind of did. A: It really impressed me, just you know, feeling A: but I wasn't a Christian when I went there, A: but, uh, I think that a lot of those, those you know, generational things A: I think, that God sees I'm praying, you know, A: that keeps the Christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray, because that does affect that things, you know, in your background. A: Hi, Maureen. A: How are you? B: All right. A: Well do you have a family budget? B: No, B: we probably should, B: but we haven't. B: So why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done, which you've found useful and workable. A: Okay. A: We do a few things, A: and I have to say we're, my husband and I are both from financial backgrounds. A: I, I'm an accountant. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, he has an M B A, A: so, uh, we were sort of, you know, keyed in on expenses and things like that. A: So B: Um, okay. A: Um, coming from that background, what we pretty much do is we, in our household, as far as living expenses, we live on a cash budget. A: Every month, my husband, uh, goes to the credit union and withdraws, you know, X amount of dollars for the month, A: and then that money is used during that month. A: We have a certain budget. B: Uh-huh. A: Excuse me. For instance, I control all the household expenses, the groceries, uh, the haircuts, the gasoline for my car, any miscellaneous expenses, baby-sitting, things like that. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, excuse me, if, uh, it comes the end of the month and I don't have any money, uh, we don't buy any more milk B: Uh-huh A: But, uh, we've gotten pretty good at it, A: we've been doing it a couple of years now. B: Uh-huh. A: So, we, our budgets are realistic A: and they are not so stringent and, you know to make us feel uncomfortable. B: Hm. A: And I, I really try to stretch my, my dollars here and there, shopping, uh, at warehouses sometimes, like at Sam's and things like that. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, we live, we live on, on a cash budget A: and it, sometimes it's tight come the end of the month, A: but generally, we always make it. B: What do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for, B: the, you know are sometimes several hundred dollars, like, uh, tires for the car or car repair of some sort, or, like a, a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for? A: Right. A: Well, uh, most of our medical things, we don't, uh, have to worry about, because of insurance A: and they're, they're relatively small. A: Uh, we've been lucky. A: In the past we didn't have that problem A: but right now we don't. A: For the other things, the things that crop up, that we aren't really expecting, we have different funds set aside for different things. A: Like we have a car fund A: and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not. B: Oh. A: So, I mean, A: and I, I can't really remember what it is. B: Do you kind of continue, call this like, a part of savings account or a different savings account B: or, A: It's all part of the savings account. A: We just keep track of it on paper. A: Uh, you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account. A: We decide, okay, you know, let's say it's a hundred dollars. A: You know, every month fifteen dollars is for car fund. You know, B: Oh. A: Ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever. A: Uh, and we just, we constantly do that, so that there's a buildup of money for those things if something does come up. A: Like I know that my washing machine is going to go any day. B: Oh, okay. A: So, but, we have the money set aside, A: so if it does it's not going to kill us. B: Hm. A: Uh, so we're, we're actually, we're pretty disciplined, A: so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through. B: Okay, B: then, so like your pay, what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that, you know, will cover all of the expenses, kind of thing? A: Well, in. B: Or like what, what percent, do you then save or something? A: Uh, we have a lot of different things. A: Right now, we save about twenty-five percent of our, of our pay. B: Hm, okay. A: It, and it goes toward different things, A: it's for, you know, for vacations like I said, for, you know, emergencies like for car, uh, breaks down, something like that. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, and we also put money aside for our kids college. B: Uh-huh. A: Neither of us had any help with our college degrees, A: and just this last month we paid off my final school loan. A: So B: Oh. A: We're starting our kids a little bit early. B: Okay. A: Do you, uh, use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things? B: Checking account a lot, uh, not so much credit cards. A: Sure. B: and so pretty much now, uh, we don't use them too much. B: If we travel or something, yeah. But, you know. Standard, we usually don't. A: Uh-huh. B: Or if it, it is a purchase, uh, then it's paid off when the bill comes. B: You know, so it isn't any extended, uh, B: it may be that I picked up something at the store, B: but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then, B: so it's not any, you know, uh, build up on the charge cards at all. A: That's good. B: And, but that hasn't always been the case B: So, I'm kind of, B: I feel at least better now that I have finally gotten some of those things, uh, you know, in the past, B: and I don't have, you know, big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards, because that interest rate just is a killer. A: Oh, and it's not deductible anymore. B: Yeah, B: well, I've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow. B: But, uh, pretty much when I always, I go to the grocery store or something I just always write checks. A: Yeah. A: We did, we did that for a long time A: and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things. B: Hm. A: And it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget. A: Well the first time we did it, we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be, B: Uh-huh. A: and then we kept track of everything for a month. You know, how much we spent on food, how much we spent on gasoline, how much we spent on everything, and from that built, you know, a cash budget. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: So now, I mean, I have, A: I don't remember what it is now, four hundred dollars for the month, let's say. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, I mean some months I may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else, A: and some months it may be different. B: Uh-huh. A: It's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves, you know, down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing, A: but the way we set up, you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for, you know, uh, utilities and, uh, the house payment and all that. B: Yeah. A: those are things you don't really have much control over. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, the cash budget just fits right in there A: like I said if we don't have, we also set aside money for entertainment. A: I mean, but again it's a set amount every month. And, uh, on special occasions, I mean birthdays and things like that. B: Uh-huh. A: We, we don't, we still have fun on things B: Yeah. B: Uh, we are in the process of trying to buy a house, B: do you know, how did your budget work B: or did you have a budget to, uh, get your down payment going to get a house? A: Well, no A: not originally, because when we, we did buy, when we bought our first house, it was at a time where you A: and the kind of loan we got, you really didn't have to put down anything. B: Huh. A: So, we got into it fairly cheaply, A: and then, uh, after we sold the first house, we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house. B: Oh, okay. A: So, we, we got out of that one pretty easily B: Okay, uh, B: yeah, B: I just keep thinking all the time B: I mean, it, it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your, you know, your priority, at least mine is to save for the house. B: But then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long, long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment. B: You feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime. A: Sure, A: I know. A: That's how I feel sometimes about my kids' education, A: I mean jeez, they are one and four A: We have got a long time to save, A: my husband, he's the real, he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually. B: Uh-huh. A: Oh, no, A: no B: Well, I know, B: but there are times when I sit there and I think, wow, you know we make X amount of money and where is it. B: I mean you look around B: and you go, where is it, A: What do you do with it, A: I know. B: you, you haven't made, uh, big purchases B: and that's the easier thing to see, B: if you can see a big purchase and you go okay, well this is the year that we bought the couch or the T V, or something like that. A: Uh-huh, B: But, all those, just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door B: and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries, and stuff. B: That you don't have tangible, I mean the perishable kind of things that's gone, used and gone. A: Yeah, A: it's, it's amazing how much we spend on some things. A: My husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work. B: Oh. A: And that's all he has, A: he has a ten dollar bill. B: Huh. A: And, I mean, so I'd say at least, two usually three times a week he takes his lunch. B: Uh-huh. A: The other times, he'll, uh, I don't know go out somewhere, eat in a cafeteria or whatever. B: Uh-huh. A: But, but he keeps himself on that, A: I mean, he found it's, it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch. B: Uh-huh. A: That's a hundred dollars a month on lunch. B: Uh-huh. A: That's, that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch. B: Yeah. A: When he can take a sandwich, you know. A: Well, how about you, are you an exercise fanatic? B: No. A: Me either B: I'm definitely B: I do like to walk. A: Do you? B: Yes. B: Since T I has, uh, uh, instituted that, um, walkabout, I have gone out and started walking even more, bought me the, you know, the proper shoes and everything to get started, and, uh, park out there, you know, way out there in the boondocks. A: Yeah. A: Wonderful. Uh-huh. B: It was so funny the other day, B: I took some guys to, to lunch B: and when we came back they said "Oh, there's a parking space real close," and I parked way out in the boonies, A: Way. *what is this? B: and I said "you can walk off your lunch." A: That's the way to do it. B: Yeah. A: I'm kind of like you, A: I've never really gotten into it, A: it's just a, it's just a chore, you know, B: Um, um. Oh. A: and I finally decided one semester, I'm in college and I'm taking night classes and I still don't have any of my P E classes, A: and so one semester I thought, okay, that's what I'm going to do A: and that will get me where I'll have to do it, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: and they were offering a, a walking class, where you, you know, you have to walk, you know, that like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes, you get, you get points, you know, B: Um, um. Um, um. A: and then you have to go in once a week and log your points A: so it's not like you can do the class like anytime you want, you know, A: and, at the end of the semester you go back in and your, like your final exam is a three mile walk. B: Oh. A: And if you walk it in this many minutes, you get an A, A: this many minutes you get a B, B: Uh-huh. A: and, I thought, oh, this will be an easy class. A: and, you know, and I did it, and I did it for a long time A: like about the middle of the semester I ended up having to have surgery on my foot, B: Oh, no. A: and this has been a couple of years ago, B: Uh-huh. A: and, you know, I had, I did that, A: and I just ended up having to drop the class. B: Oh. A: you know, by the time the final came around, I wasn't even where I could wear a shoe yet, let alone walk three miles, you know. B: Oh, no. B: Yeah. A: But, that was the only time I have ever been able to like start an exercise program and really stick to it, because then I had to, I had to go every week and log in what I had walked, B: Um, um. Right. A: and, my teacher looked at it every week, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: But, other than that I just, you know, I kind of get in the mood every once in awhile, say, okay, I'm going to start going to aerobics now, you know, B: Uh-huh. B: There you go. A: and, I'll go for like two weeks and go, this is for the birds, this is too much work. B: Well, you know, I have noticed too that, uh, when I started the exercise, uh, not the exercise but the walking program, uh, that I did tone up, you know, like all over, A: Uh-huh. B: but it didn't get the upper part of my body, A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, so, what I do, is I bowl. B: I am a fanatic when it comes to bowling, B: and I used to bowl five times a week, A: Wow. B: so, I really loved it, A: Yeah. B: and I still bowl at least once a week now, on a league, on, on a, B: and I'm bowling on the T I league. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, but I've noticed that what I do is that I have my towel that sits on the floor, so that every time I get up to bowl, I have to bend over to pick up my towel B: and that way I get the little extra exercise. A: Uh-huh. B: I'm always explaining to people, I do little things like that, like, you know, take the stairs instead of the, um, the elevator, A: Yeah. B: and, I do silly things like that versus a, a regular program that you would have. A: But that's, A: you're amazed at how much that adds up. B: It sure does. A: I was on, uh, Nutri Systems for a while, B: Uh-huh. A: and, that is one of the things that they really stressed doing, you know, A: when you come to your Nutri System meeting, don't park in the parking place outside the front door, park at the other end, you know, B: Yeah B: Right. A: I mean, and they stretched, stressed things like that too. A: You know, during, when you're sitting watching T V at night, during every commercial get up off the couch, go to the living room and get a glass of water, go to the bedroom and make the bed, go do something, but get up during every commercial. And, things like that. B: Uh-huh. B: There you go. A: And, you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up, you know, just gives you a little more activity A: so, B: That's true. A: especially when you're like us and don't really want to do it anyway. B: No, B: I used to, B: I really did, uh, years ago B: and, uh, I was thinking about that not too long ago that I used to walk B: and not only did I walk B: but, I used to watch all those exercise programs on T V, B: and I would tape them, A: Yeah. B: and then I would do them like two times a day, B: but I don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore. B: I think having children everything just kind of, everything goes by the wayside. A: Well, I can't use that as an excuse because I didn't do it before A: I had mine either. A: I've never been, A: I just, I'm more into, you know, sitting, than I am B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Me too. A: so, but, you know, I have found that with, A: I have a two year old, B: Uh-huh. A: and I have found really though, I'm kind of the opposite, I'm more active now with him, than I was before, because now, you know, he'll "I want to go outside" and I'll go outside with him B: Yeah. A: and we'll walk up and down the street, A: and we'll go to the park A: and I'll run around with him and stuff like that, A: that, A: so I'm getting more, you know, more exercise that way than I ever did before I had him, you know. B: Um, um. Um, um. A: so, I think, I think that has helped a little bit, A: I don't know. B: Yeah, B: yeah, A: Just chasing him around the house, you know, will be plenty for you. B: that's enough. B: Well, mine are older now, doing, uh, their own things B: so, A: Right, A: right. A: You've kind of gotten out of that little stage there. B: Oh, yes. B: Yes, B: I have a thirteen year old and an eleven year old, B: so. A: Oh, lucky you, B: Yes. A: you're getting into even more interesting stages. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: We're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager A: Uh-huh, A: yeah, A: yeah B: Yeah, B: you watch it'll be exactly the same A: Same thing, huh, it repeats, the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen B: It does, B: it, it absolutely does, B: so. A: How interesting, I can hardly wait B: Yeah, B: I, I, I know, I just know you can't. B: But, no, B: I don't get as much exercise as I used to B: but, I at least, since T I has implemented that program, I do, B: I'm more aware of it, A: Yeah. B: and, you know, that I'm need to do this, that and the other B: and, uh, so, I try to do combinations of things but not, like go down to the President's Health Club, like I see all these people do. A: Right. A: That, that walkabout's a good program. B: It is, B: it is. A: It really is, you know, A: when they first started it, I, I got all the information, of course, A: but just like everything else, I was real gung ho with a friend of mine, A: "Oh, we're going to do this, we're going to do this," A: and we did do it for a long time, B: Yeah. A: and then I started school, you know, B: Um, um. A: and like two nights a week I was going to school A: and then the other two nights a week my husband worked, A: so I had to pick Ryan up, you know, B: Oh, yeah. A: there's always an excuse, you know, to not do it B: Oh, yeah. A: so, B: And, it gets worse, B: it doesn't get any better. A: Yeah, A: oh, I'm sure, A: I'm sure. B: Yeah, B: because I'm constantly running my children around someplace B: and that's where I actually get my exercise, is running them from here to there, in the car. A: Yeah. A: here to here, A: here, A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: to the mall, to the movies, to the friends, to the, B: There you go, B: that's it, B: that's it. A: Sounds like fun. B: Well, it was nice talking to you. A: Well, it was really good to talk to you. B: Yeah, B: well okay, B: we'll talk to you later. A: Take care, A: talk to you later. B: Um, um. B: Bye-bye. A: So, do you fish? B: Oh, yeah. B: My dad has a lake cabin, B: and so we go there for the small lake, uh, just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area. B: It takes us about three hours to get there. B: And we go, and we fish, B: and we catch a bunch of junk Nothing, nothing to talk about for the most part, B: but it's fun. A: Uh, from a boat or from shore? B: From the dock, from shore. A: Oh, that's nice. A: Uh, mostly catfish A: or, B: Oh, mostly we catch carp. B: If we're doing good, we catch a catfish or two once in a while. B: And, you know, we go ahead and eat those. B: But we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry. B: What we normally do is just, uh, go ahead and clean it up, and then, uh, you know, put it in a bag and freeze it. B: And, and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd. B: Usually, there's a pretty good crowd there, B: so we don't ever catch enough to eat. B: Carp is usually pretty much fun. B: Because I've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little, you know, a little pole with twenty pound test line. B: And that, that's a pretty good fight. B: So that's a lot of fun. A: Yeah. A: A real light line, real light rig? B: Yeah. A: Well, that sounds like fun. B: They fight hard. A: Fish in Colorado different than that. B: Yeah? A: Mostly trout in the mountains. B: Yeah, B: and in the rivers and stuff? A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: mountain streams and rivers. B: Are they good to eat? A: Uh, yeah, A: very. Yeah, very much there, you know. B: Oh, you mean size wise they're not very big? A: Um, by and large, no. A: But, but they're big fun. B: Yeah. B: Well, I've been, B: is that mostly, uh, fly fishing when you're doing that B: or, A: What? B: Are you fly fishing B: or are you using a bobber? A: I, I, I'm a fly fisherman. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I, I cast a ways. A: I'm not highly proficient, A: but it's fun. B: I've never even tried that. B: My, B: if I don't have a reel with a button on it, I tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble A: Well, let me explain fly, fly fishing to you then. A: You're not casting a weight on the end of the line? B: Uh-huh. A: You're casting the weight of the line. B: With the little thing on the end. A: Yeah, A: well, the fly on the end weighs nothing. B: Yeah, B: I thought it had a weight. A: It weighs less than the line. B: Oh. A: So what you do is, you strip off, oh, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand. B: Uh-huh. A: And you whip the line. B: Um. A: As you whip it, over your head, or side to side, you slowly feed out more and more. B: Uh-huh. B: Um. So you're fishing downstream so it will carry some? A: Well, no, A: no. A: You fish upstream. B: Oh, you fish upstream? A: Right. A: And then you let it carry it downstream. B: Uh-huh. A: And then you reel it in, A: and you do it again. B: You hope that they think it's a bug and, and eat it. A: Yeah, A: exactly. A: Yeah, A: exactly. B: Yeah. A: Jump at it. A: Uh, from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern. B: That's a fish? A: No, A: no. A: It, it looks like a grub. A: Yeah. B: Oh, it's a, it's a lure. A: Okay, A: whenever you, yeah, A: a lure, a fly. B: I see. A: Whenever you have a, something that looks like something else B: Uh-huh. A: and it's a fly, you call it a pattern. B: Oh. A: All right, uh, you know, there's bumble bee patterns there's excuse me. Uh, there's bumble patterns, there's mosquito patterns, there's wasp patterns, there's grub patterns. B: Uh-huh. B: Um. A: Uh, B: Did someone just come up with this design, B: and, and you're going to make one for yourself, A: Uh, B: or are you going to buy it? A: You can buy them. A: Uh, I've got some. A: And, They seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, it's just, that, that just happens to be what the fish like this year, B: huh? A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: Um. A: You know how that changes, the phase of the moon A: and, B: I guess so. B: We tend to use just bait. And, a few lures, A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I, I, You see, I'm from west Texas. B: but bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait. B: Oh, are you? A: Yeah. B: Where are you from? A: Lubbock. B: Oh, I'm from Midland. A: Oh, another west Texan. B: I went to college at Tech, B: so. You've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: Yeah. B: I've been up there. A: It, It, it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day. B: I didn't catch anything, B: but I've been up there B: Yeah, B: it's fun. B: It's lazy. B: Take a picnic lunch. B: I used to do that with my dad. B: Every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day. Before it got too hot. A: Yeah. A: Well, there you fish mornings and evenings. And nights. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: we do most of our fishing at night. A: Yeah. B: Just from the heat of it all. B: That's one advantage you've certainly got on us. A: It, at times, gets incredibly hot here. B: It does? B: I've only been up there once. B: In the summer. Well, B: no, B: I've been up there twice in the summer. B: But both times it was really pleasant. B: In fact, it snowed on us in, in, gosh, when was that? A: June? B: We were in Mesa Verde Park, B: and it was like the end of It was just before July fourth. A: Oh. B: And it was twenty-eight, twenty-nine degrees. B: We were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags, not knowing any better B: And here it went and it froze, B: and it snowed on us. A: Yeah. B: We did not know what to do about it. A: Fishing is not just, just dragging fish out of the water. A: It's, it's a total experience, you know, getting out in nature and, hearing the crickets, and listening to the birds and, seeing the squirrels and, camping out, and eating out, of doors B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. B: Do, B: Yeah. A: and, B: Do you have to, B: do you wear waders when you fish? A: Uh, I probably ought to. A: I just freeze. B: Oh. B: Goodness, it must be a little bit cold. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: well, you know, ankle deep or standing on the bank, and slipping it out there. B: That's cold water around there. B: Um. Do you have any, A: You know, I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it, out there, B: Oh, I see. A: and you know how it is. A: The water's kind of, B: Yeah. B: And you get, you get a little more carried away with it, B: and you move a little closer. A: And then you're in to it just a little bit, A: and then you splash in A: and, the next thing you know, your knees are wet. B: Yeah. B: Do you have any kids that you take fishing? A: Uh, got a stepdaughter. B: Uh-huh. A: She's real sweet. A: And, uh, at times she enjoys it, at times not. B: Yeah. A: A fuzzy little dog. B: I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old. A: Oh. B: And the little one, of course, is, could care less. A: Yeah. B: The, uh, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point, B: we got him a little pole last year, B: and just put, uh, his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up B: That was what he considered fishing B: This year, he's gotten to where he can. B: We, we were at a friend's, uh, stock pond, we were out at their farm, B: and, and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish. A: Yeah. B: And he started trying to cast it. B: So, he, he was kind of getting there B: but he's, He's at a dangerous point right now A: Yeah, A: you guys sure want to be out of range. B: He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in. A: It takes time. B: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Last year, we had a, oh, just a wonderful trip up to Travers Lake. * Trapper's Lake in Colorado? A: Oh, it was cold, and rain the whole time. A: And we still had a good time out, of the deal. B: Yeah. B: Well, that's good. A: Uh, and Colorado is a beautiful place to live. B: Oh, yeah. B: My husband would like to live there, B: but I don't know. All of our family is here B: so, A: Well, and you've got to have, A: you've got to work for a living. B: Well, yeah, B: but T I is up there, B: so that part of it would probably work out A: What division you all in? B: I'm sorry, what? A: What division are you all in? B: We're both, uh, B: I was, uh, military, B: but he's division three. B: It goes back and forth. B: Division, well, B: maybe division one right now. B: He's in computers. A: Oh. B: So, A: Well, the only thing up here, is division one. B: And he's in school, and everything else. B: I have some friends who work up there. A: Oh, yeah? B: Kathy and Kevin Guy. A: Okay. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: And they like to fish. B: They've been inviting us to come up there in the summer. B: Her dad has a cabin, B: and they go fishing, up there. A: Oh, fishing's, fishing is fun up here. B: So that would be neat to, try it some time. A: It's not, A: It seems like the success ratio, the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there. A: But it is fun. B: Yeah, A: You know, The, the experience is, is better up here, I think. B: long as you have a good time, that's the main point B: so, B: Uh-huh. A: You know, it seems more relaxing, there's more to look at. B: Definitely more to look at. A: And, and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul You know, if you're, if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake, B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up. B: We camped next to one, one time when we were there a couple of summers ago. B: And we figured we were up a long way off. B: And then it rained that night, B: and we thought, well, wonder how far off we are? B: And we got up the next day, B: and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away B: And it's like, oh, well, maybe we ought to move just a touch. B: So, that was kind of funny. A: Yeah, A: it, it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden. B: Yeah, B: I just love the way it looks. B: I could almost just watch the B: we, in fact, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much, B: and if you were there. I mean, B: it was, B: one time we were there, B: and I guess it was late May, B: so it was really your spring almost, you know, at, even though it was, it was really summer down here. A: Uh-huh. B: And, and the, I guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt, B: and the creek was just wild, just running. B: And, and all the white water and noise and the, B: it was just beautiful. A: Yeah. A: it gets foamy almost. B: Uh-huh. A: And you know it's just pure and pristine. And the froth B: Yeah. A: and, A: Okay, um, A: I have two children A: and they're older now, A: but, um, I found it very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for stay while I thought school, B: Uh-huh. A: and, um, I wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old I preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home A: and that's what I looked for A: and I was lucky enough to find one right across from my school, A: and that worked. B: Well, that's good. A: Yeah, A: that worked out real well A: but when they got older I wanted them to be in a school type situation, three, I think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and, and be around kids their own age because I think that's that, that would prepare them for school also, it's real important , that they do that, um, that they get that preparation for school, B: Uh-huh. B: Yes, B: yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: so A: but I had, A: I have switched schools several times because I, I really didn't care for what was going on at that the school. A: I wanted them to learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age. B: Yeah, B: I, um, B: that, that's, B: oh, oh, you mean you switched schools for the kids. A: Yeah, A: for the for the kids. B: Uh-huh. A: Yes. B: well, I'm just recently married. A: Uh-huh. B: So I don't have any children. Though we plan on having them soon A: Okay. B: but I think, um, that I, that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties, uh, B: I think, um, I'm lucky though that, um, my wife will probably not have to work while our children, are under four, or five. A: Oh. A: Wonderful. B: Yeah, B: I'm a college professor, A: Oh, B: so, A: great. B: and that's also, B: and it's nice for me because, um, most of the time you have so, so much flexible hours so that I could probably work two or three days a week, and then one or two evenings, so that if my wife does, um, does go back to work part time, um, there probably will be a possibility that I could stay home two days that she would go to work and that I would have to teach at night. A: Um. A: Great. A: Oh that's, wonderful. B: Yeah, B: so it will probably workout real nice for us, uh, A: Yeah. B: I think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules, A: That's wonderful. B: I can even teach on Saturdays and, and things, like that. A: Oh, A: great, B: Yeah, B: um, I do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding, uh, child care, A: Right. B: and one of the things they made in, um, uh, B: real B: they're number one priority was that, um, they're children didn't have to leave their home *transcript error--spelling of initial "they're" should be "their" A: Oh, that's, wonderful too, B: So, they, um, um, B: my sister-in-law is a, uh, um, a clinical speech pathologist, A: Uh-huh. B: so, she is B: I guess her most recent position after she returned back to work, she applied for a director's position and got it. B: So, I guess she's very well qualified for her field I guess B: and even though she took off two years for, um, B: I guess four years all together, A: Uh-huh. B: it would be three years, B: how old's Kayla B: three, yeah, B: I guess she took off three years all together, um, for cause I guess they have a four year old, B: and yeah, and my nephew is two, almost two, A: Uh-huh. B: so I guess she took off three all together B: and then when she decided to go back to work, um, she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home. A: Oh, that's wonderful. B: Yeah, B: I think they were really lucky there, B: but I think they've lost this woman she she will not continue. A: Oh, dear. B: And, and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school. A: Sure, A: yeah. B: So I don't know what they are going to do. A: Oh, you know that's an ideal situation, B: Uh-huh. A: but not many people can afford, something like, B: Yeah, B: I think, I think they they're both, they were both professionals unlike me they're, um, they were married, my brother's five years younger then she is, A: Uh-huh. B: so she was probably twenty-seven when they were married, A: Uh-huh. B: so she already had, had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a, in a practice almost. Um, where, you know, he then they waited a couple years A: Sure. A: Uh-huh. B: and, and he got himself pretty far along, I guess they didn't have kids until he was about, twenty twenty-six B: so by that time she was so well established, you know, I guess it made it a lot easier. A: Right. A: Sure. B: but, uh, I think the longer you wait the easier, the easier it is, if you have that, that professional occupation where you can change. A: Oh, I do to. A: Oh, yeah, B: Yeah. A: but they're they're are just so many people out there that aren't that, uh, lucky, uh, B: Yeah. B: That's right, B: that's true, yeah. A: uh, because I'm a single parent, B: Uh-huh. A: and I, uh, you know, my husband and I, ex-husband and I got a divorce, um, when the children were small A: and so I, uh, was a teacher A: I, uh, still am teacher, B: Uh-huh. A: and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was what I wanted, where I could, have piece of mind and when I taught school * transcriber spelling error--"piece" should be "peace" B: Yep. B: Yeah, A: and I knew my kids were being taken, care of. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: and, uh, plus I, I, uh, wanted them to get something out of it, I just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and, that's it . B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah B: that, B: yeah, B: that's, you know, that's so important I, um, I, I guess it's so funny now with schools, you know, they don't take kid into kindergarten, and when, I guess when they're five, A: Uh-huh. B: and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now. A: Right. B: They don't let them into kindergarten unless they can count to ten and know their A B C B: and I think that's so funny because, um, I don't, I don't know if I want A: Sure. B: and I, B: it's a very important part of your life B: and I hope to read with my kids, B: but I don't know if I want my kids to go to school. At four, or three, A: Well. A: I agree with that. B: you know, I can see that when you make that point. A: Well, the thing is, I teach this grade and I, I can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other, children B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically, because they were not, they're should be, there's to many things in their way, *to should be too B: Uh-huh. B: Yep, B: uh-huh. A: and so I want my A: I wanted my children A: and they did learn to get, to get along with other people. B: Uh-huh, B: that's a really important point. A: Yeah, A: and I mean I feel a lot of maladjusted adults A: and I bet if we trace back to their, early childhood we could see some, you know, times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with, people. B: Yep. B: I think that's really, that's important B: I, I've seen the same thing B: I, I think you're exactly right because, you know, I've gone B: or B: before I was married I went out with a girl, B: and you know, um, boy, after, you know, after about two months I realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems. A: Uh-huh. B: And I bet, B: and they could be traced back to just not being, uh, you know, being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years old, and never, always being a bit snippy and spiteful. A: Uh-huh. B: I bet you could trace all the way back A: I bet you could too, because it, you know, kids have to learn how to get along with other people, B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really, you know, good adults or, successful adults I should say, B: That's true, B: yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: you know, really A: but, uh, it is a big problem A: and you I have lot of friends right now that, uh, have young children A: and they daily have problems with, with whoever is taking care of the child, B: Uh-huh. A: or they switch a lot, which is not good for the child either. B: Yep, B: that's true. B: Yeah, B: that's really true. A: So you need, A: cause you need that consistency when they're young like that, A: and it would be ideal like you, you hope when you have children, your wife gets to stay home, B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: I would have, have given anything if I would have been able, to stay home with my children. B: Yeah, B: I, I think I'm, I'm very lucky. A: Yeah, A: you. B: Um, because of having, you know, flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule. A: Right. B: I teach a computer classes B: so, it's, it's one of things where I'm paid a little bit better then a History or an English professor A: Oh, great. B: and I'm also, um, you know, B: they have vocational type courses on weekends, almost everywhere, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and, you know, you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday, which means, that, you know, whole week's worth of courses A: Oh, that's, wonderful. B: so that lets you be available three days during the week, you know, A: Oh, great. B: so you be will home with your kids I you know B: it's really funny is that I, I picked this career when I was in college because, uh, I think with my commitment to family and, um, wanting to spend more time with my children, because my dad had very, um, nine to five type job, with, uh, forty-five minute commute into the city, and a forty-five commute home, A: Um. You're very wise. A: Uh-huh. B: so, by the time he got home he was so tired B: and he was all rung out from the day, A: Sure. B: and I think he, he missed a lot of, um, our up bringing. A: Sure. B: You know, my mother B: I, I came from a family, that my mother stayed home until we started school. A: Uh-huh. thirteen and a sixteen year old. B: Um, and I, I don't, uh, B: It's probably costing you a fortune. A: Oh it is, A: they really are expensive, A: yeah. B: My goodness, if, if you want them to be able to drive the car, the insurance bill. A: Exactly. B: um, A: Well, and they A: most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars. B: Oh. A: So, you know, right now I'm looking for a little truck for my for my son, B: Uh-huh. A: so that you know an older, older, older, truck A: so I can afford it, B: Yeah. A: but, you know, I, I just look forward to him helping me out because I for years just car, drove in carpools all over the place B: Carpools, uh, A: and, And it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store, will you take his sister somewhere, something like that. B: Yeah, B: my parents did a lot of that. B: That's right. B: Yep. B: And just to save you trips to and from, you know, uh, ball games and athletic events, and activities at the school. A: Right, A: exactly. A: Right. A: That's right. B: Yeah, B: isn't that something how, you know, you think about child care B: and it lasts along time. *along a long A: It, does for ever. B: It, it lasts a long time. A: And then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren, A: so A: It's not ending is it A: You think we've talked a long, a long enough time? A: Oh, they come in, see this is the first time I've done this. A: Oh, in ten minutes, you have to talk that long. B: Well, you don't have to B: but they, they, A: Uh-huh. B: um, you go the length B: and sometimes if it's a very busy time period you'll go about seven minutes. A: Oh. B: Depends on how old the tapes are at that time. A: I see. B: Uh-huh. A: I see. B: Yeah. A: Are you from the, A: where are you from? B: This is Baltimore, Maryland. A: Oh, my gosh, I'm from, uh, Plano, Texas which is, which is outside of Dallas. B: Yeah, B: well, most of most of the people I talk to are from Texas. A: Yeah A: because that's where T I is B: Uh-huh, B: yeah, B: and I've discussed, I've discussed, um. A: That makes sense. A: Okay. A: Guess we can go ahead. A: Uh, well, I guess you know it's, you know, A: since living in Dallas it's always so hot, so in the summertime, I just, I wear lots of shorts, so because I don't work during the day. B: Uh-huh. A: So, do you work? B: Yes, B: uh-huh, B: yeah, B: I do work. A: Oh. B: Uh, and, B: but I work at a manufacturing plant, B: so I wear a lot of blue jeans, and T-shirts. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: But occasionally I have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress, and high heel shoes A: Uh-huh. B: and I feel really uncomfortable doing that B: and, in the plant so, uh, it's, it's a problem for me. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: But, normally I just wear blue jeans and a T-shirt. A: Uh-huh. B: Very, very, comfortable. B: I like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: and buying suits and stuff, yeah, because just being at home A: and, I work at home, A: so, I just have, you know, I just wear my, you know, my shorts and stuff like that. B: Uh-huh. A: I don't go out and spend lots of money on, uh, different, you know, suits and stuff, you know. B: Uh-huh, B: uh-huh. A: But when I, A: before I got married, you know, I was working A: so I, uh, you know, I had more suits and stuff then A: but, B: Right A: Worry about all that kind of stuff B: Well, I have plenty of suits and dress clothes because I'm like you, when I first started working, uh, I have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match, and that kind of stuff A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: but now that I, you know, work in the manufacturing plant, then it's just, it's so much more difficult for me to, to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that. A: Right. B: Uh, but occasionally I have to because, uh, part of my job is teaching, and training, A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal, garb A: When you're training, right. A: Yeah. B: Than your normal garb B: But I'm like you, too, uh, I moved from Ohio down to here A: Uh-huh, A: moved from, Winter. B: and I had mostly polyesters and, wools and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes, A: Uh-huh. B: and then, of course, you have to iron them all the time. A: Uh-huh. B: That's really, B: that's been a problem for me. A: Yeah, A: because I came from But, really, that's a previous generation. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't, B: it's harder to imagine people of our age doing that, and not feeling really stupid. A: Right. A: Right. A: Right A: I agree. A: Well, I think we've, we've gotten our five minutes A: or, B: Well, they've gotten their five minutes worth of us. B: I've enjoyed talking with you. A: It was nice talking to you, too. B: Okay, B: take care. A: You, too. A: Bye, bye. B: Bye, bye. A: Okay. A: Well, how do you feel about, uh, drug testing? B: Um, personally, I don't have a problem with it, uh, B: I think, uh, as far as, uh, protecting fellow employees, protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do, um, it's justified. B: On the other hand, um, I do agree that it's, it's a, it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work. A: Yeah. B: Um, I would never, I would never have a problem with anyone testing me, B: but I can understand why people would object. B: So, I guess, uh, I guess, uh, I'm kind of mixed on it, still at this point. A: Yeah. A: I am too a little bit, A: I mean, I, I don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing, B: Uh-huh. A: and, and, you know, obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth, A: but I don't really like having to do it. A: It, B: That's right. A: And I don't like the idea of it, it's, it's, makes too much of a big brother type of thing. B: That's absolutely right. B: It, it, uh, I guess it all comes down to, uh, you know, a, a definition of, uh, how much out, outside activities affect your work B: and, uh, uh, granted, you know, that, B: any, any kind of drug use on, on company property and whatnot, is, is definitely not acceptable. A: Yeah. B: Uh, uh, I don't think anybody would ever argue that. Or, uh, any, any after affects carrying over into the workday A: Huh-uh. B: but, um, you know, I don't, I'm not particularly concerned with what people do, um, after they leave for the day especially if I don't, if I don't, uh, see any results of it the next day. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: I think so too. A: But, you know, it's one of those things. B: Well, it, it is, it, you know, B: on the other hand you, you've got, uh, you've got the, uh, the possibility of people, oh, B: you've got some people could be arrested for, uh, drug use, drug dealings and things like that, B: and, uh, if their, if their employers name hits the papers and that it's, it's, it's a mark against them, A: Yeah. B: the company and, uh, you know, what kind of people work there, what, uh, A: Plus, I guess, if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time, then the company has lost what they've put into that employee, and their expertise or whatever. B: That's right. B: That's right. B: Right. B: even if it is, you know, a company policy of, uh, immediate termination or whatever, they still have to replace them. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, there's, there's a lot involved there. A: Well, do you think that, um, it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing A: or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule A: or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it? B: I think, I think the regular schedule stuff, um, that when you say everybody get out of it, that's a good point, B: I never really thought of it that way. A: Well, you know, if, if they have time enough they can, stay off of it. B: Yeah, B: if they really can, B: um, I think the the biggest problem I've got is, is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment. A: Yeah. B: Um, as far as the new hires, I, I hired on just early enough that I, I missed it. Um, where the new hires were concerned B: but, uh, not, nobody, no, B: I don't think anybody questions that, um, testing someone as a, as a precondition to being hired B: but, um, for the conditions that, for our employment to change while you're on the job that's, I, I don't know, that, that's where I think that most people get upset. B: It's, uh, you know, it, it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically B: and, uh, It's just, it, it's a really tough question A: Yeah. B: and it, you know, it, B: people have, have really quieted down after everything started B: but I still think there's a lot of, there's a lot of resentment. A: I think so too, uh, A: I know the, the group I was in at the time this all came up they, uh, were quite vocal about it, through electronic mail, A: boy, they just really, you know let them have it from one end to the other, vehemently B: Uh-huh. B: You bet. A: but, uh, it has quieted down, A: but I don't think they probably feel any differently, B: No, B: that's right. A: and some, some of them did quit the company. B: Yeah, B: I, I know of some people who did, uh, B: it was, it was indirectly related, you know, B: they could always come up with other reasons B: but it, it had a lot to do with it. Just the, the whole attitude, B: because it's really, uh, it's just really, B: it, it seems so B: T I, you know, with the, the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have, um, to all of a sudden, uh, search for attitudes and whatnot. A: True. B: You know, there's not a lot of pressure to, to vote the right way or anything else around T I. B: Like there, like there is in some companies or at least, you know, B: from what I've heard, A: Uh-huh. B: but, uh, B: yeah A: Yeah, A: I wouldn't like anything of that nature, you know, B: Uh-huh. B: No, B: I, A: don't tell me what to do, you know. B: Absolutely not, you know, B: it's, it's, it's, you know, B: if you hired me I'll be, you know, B: supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with B: so, uh, you know, let's, let's stick with that original trust, I guess. A: Yeah. B: But, uh, it's, it's still, it, it still remains a tough question B: and, it's, there's a lot of, you know, the whole, the whole department of defense, uh, reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot. B: There's a lot of different things that, uh, come into play B: but that was, B: I think everybody, everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company. A: Yeah. A: Well, I guess too if I thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem, then that would be one thing. But I think it's too minor and too, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: in, in the whole scope of things this isn't going to, to have any real affect on, what's going on in the street. B: I really don't think so. B: Yeah. B: I really don't because, some people are going to, are, are going to risk it, um, B: it may prevent, B: I, I guess, I guess what I'm trying to get at is, if it, if it, if it does help a few individuals maybe, maybe it's worth it. A: Yeah. B: Um, you know, it may prevent somebody who was, was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot B: but, uh, I don't know if, you know, the, B: it's, it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation B: I don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much. B: There, there's still a big question in my mind B: that, the, the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of, of mistakes on the testing, is something that still bothers me. A: Well, yes. B: It, it's, A: That, A: yes. A: I, I think that could be a big problem, you know, A: I would just be irate if they said it was positive and I knew it wasn't, B: Uh-huh. A: you know, that just really rubbed me the wrong way. B: Uh-huh. B: Absolutely. B: And that, B: I, I don't know if, uh, I don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too. even if you, you know, if you take, uh, a, a drug that was prescribed for you B: but the, the prescription has run out you still had some left B: and you happen to take an extra penicillin, B: well, penicillin's not on the list B: but, you know, A: Yeah. B: yeah, B: I, I think you understand what I'm getting at, A: Yeah. B: it, it can still show up B: and it can still flag as a positive B: and, and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent, A: Right. A: No. B: and, uh, those are the kinds of things that still can show up. A: I guess the one that really got me too was that, uh, A: let's say your spouse is on a particular drug A: and you know what that is, B: Uh-huh. A: and then you end up with the same problem A: and you take their leftover medicine, A: that's not allowed. B: That's right. A: You know, that's, that's totally out. B: That's right. B: I even had friends when I was going to college who were in, uh, pharmacy school B: and they could legally, um, provide medicine to their family family members and friends B: certain medicines were, were legal now B: I, I, I believe, you know, any of the, any of the ones we would, we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists, A: Uh-huh. B: but, uh, um, there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications B: and, that can happen. A: Oh, that's interesting. B: But, uh, A: Well, I guess we've exhausted that one. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: I think so A: enjoyed talking to you. B: You too. A: Good-bye. B: Good-bye. A: Well, what's your views on it? B: I think it's, uh, a good idea. B: Um, I grew up, uh, B: my teenage years were spent during the sixties, B: graduating, uh, high school in sixty-eight. Um, I remember when the Peace Corps movement first came about, B: and I thought it was a very good idea at the time. B: I was one of those, uh, Kennedy children, if you know what I mean. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, right now I see a lot of kids who get out of school, have no idea what they want to do. A: Yeah. B: And there's a lot of things out there that we could do, uh, for our own country, A: Sure. B: let alone other countries, A: Sure. B: and I think that we've got the, the people power to do it, B: it's just, uh, B: we need to channel it and focus it on some things that, that need some fixing up. B: Um, some examples are this, uh, some of the things, like Jimmy Carter's been involved in, uh, a little program to, you know, fix up housing for people. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: And there's a lot of housing, A: Yeah. B: I know in the area that I live in, that's run down and beat up, B: but it could be fixed up and used, A: Uh-huh. B: and it's just, you know, sitting there wasting away. A: Yeah, A: we're not too far behind A: I graduated in seventy-one, A: so I'm, I'm same generation. A: I, I'm, A: it's going to be a short conversation because I agree with you. A: I, I think, uh, I don't, I don't even think it ought to be, uh, voluntary, A: I think it ought to be mandatory. Uh, for kids to either, either do military service, or public service, one of the two. A: Uh, a lot of reasons for that, not, not just because I'm a, I'm a hard ass or anything. B: Uh-huh. A: It's just that, like you say, kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do, A: and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus. A: And, I think that it might stop us some problems later on. A: I mean, you know these kids will get their, their heads on straight, and, and figure out what they want to do, instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something. A: Uh, it's, I think it would be good for them, uh, A: it helps mature them a little bit, and helps them understand the world, the way it really is. B: Yeah, B: I think a lot of people grow up with, uh, with, uh, preconceived notions what the world's about. A: Oh, yeah. B: A lot of it has to do from too much T V, A: Oh, yeah, A: yeah. B: and, uh, you know, it's, there's, there's a heck of a lot of difference between, you know, the intake that you get from T V and, and movies, and what you hear in school, and then what reality is. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, I remember, uh, I've, I've worked since I was, B: well, I started delivering papers when I was ten, B: and I had a real job when I was thirteen, B: so I've, you know, worked most of my life. B: But I remember when I got out of high school, all through high school was, B: boy, I can't wait to get out of high school, B: I can't wait to get out of high school. B: And I wanted to go to college, B: and I had the grades to go to college, B: and I got accepted to college, B: but when I got out of high school, I kind of said, you know, what am I going to do now? A: Uh-huh. B: You know, it's B: like, you know, when I actually started working full time, and I, I got married shortly after getting out of high school. B: I, uh, thought I was smart, ran away and got married, B: and, uh, I remember there was a time, and within the first year of marriage, I said, boy wouldn't I give to get, be back in school, and just have to do homework, and, and go work my part time job. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Because, life, and the reality of working for a living, and trying to make ends meet, is just so overwhelming to someone, if they aren't prepared for it. A: Yeah. A: And, and most of them aren't. B: That's true. A: I mean, you look, you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right I mean, even in high school, A: and, you know, you wonder, where are the parents in all of this. A: You know, why isn't somebody stepping in and, and putting a stop to this. A: Kids in high school are just too young to be married. B: Yeah. A: They they have no idea what the world is like. A: They don't how tough it is out there to make a living. B: Yeah, B: a, A: Uh, I mean, I was in the same boat when I left high school. A: I, my parents wanted me to go straight to college A: and I didn't. A: You know, I was ready, A: I was ready, A: I had wanderlust, A: I wanted to get out and see some things. A: So, I joined the Air Force and ended up staying there for thirteen years. B: Um. A: Um, but, I had lived in my own little bubble up until that time, A: and, and after traveling around the world a few times, I realized that, things ain't the way they seem. B: Yeah. A: And I, I did a lot of growing up there, uh, B: Yeah, B: I think once, once kids get out and see how other people really live, and know how bad off some people really are, and how good they've got it, and what it takes to have that good life, if you're willing to work for it, then they're probably be more inclined to work for it. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: That's right A: That's right. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, you know, it's just like you say, there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country, A: and, uh, you know, if, if you could have a thought of something like, uh, like a, uh, uh, a Peace Corps sort of organization. I mean, this would be so useful, just in, uh, for instance, just helping old folks. B: Uh-huh, B: exactly. A: You know, they, you know they need help, A: they don't have anybody to depend on, A: and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house, or do minor repairs, or something like that. B: You know, I've, I've I, B: my, my parents are in their late sixties now, B: and, um, so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore. A: Yeah. B: And, it's, it's really hard on them, B: and the, you know, the thought that I, I see the, uh, the mall rats, you know, walking around the mall, nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long, when they could be doing something to help someone. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, you know, there's a, uh, a nice warm feeling, B: I remember getting out of doing things like that when I was younger, A: Yeah. B: I mean, I was a Boy Scout B: and the whole bit and, A: Yeah, A: my mom's in the same position, late sixties, A: and, and it got to the, got to the point where, I mean, me and my brother both were, were gone, and she couldn't maintain the house, without large expenditures of money. B: Yeah. A: You know, it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment. A: And, uh, I, I'm not, I'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway, A: but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things. You know, like the, like the yard work and little repairs, and painting and stuff like that. B: Yeah. B: I think there'd, there'd be a, you know, a, uh, economic benefit for, you know, everyone concerned, those doing the work, and those receiving the, the, uh, the services. A: Oh yeah, A: sure. A: Sure, A: I mean, I mean, the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money. B: Yeah. A: You know, that, A: I, I remember when I was a kid, I used to do little, little things for the old folks around the neighborhood, A: and, uh, I know how it made me feel. A: You know, you uh, A: people just don't help people anymore. A: They're, they're out for themselves A: and, B: Yeah. B: I think, uh, President Bush covered that in his, uh, State of the Union Address this year when he said that, you know, it's time for, you know, the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything. A: Yeah, A: well that's, that's the, that's the point we've gotten to, you know. A: Every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government. A: And, the government's going to be limited. A: I, where are they going to get the money? A: They're going to get it from us. A: And we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government. B: Yeah. A: We don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program. B: Exactly. A: Um, the thing that Carter works on, uh, Habitats For Humanity, I was involved in that uh, in Montgomery, before I came up to North Carolina, B: Uh-huh A: and, uh, it was, it was a pretty neat little program. A: We'd just go out, A: and they would buy a plot of land, and contractors and builders, A: and everybody else would donate their, their time, A: and, uh, the materials were at cost. A: And we'd put up houses. A: And, that was kind, that was kind of neat. A: I, uh, in a way, I think it's a little bit inefficient, A: but, but it's better than nothing. B: Yeah. A: And, and at least I had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing. A: Um, course, on the other hand, I can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves, but just won't. Because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw, uh, welfare money than it is to work. B: Yes. A: Uh, we did a, uh, a cost comparison in one of my courses, A: and we took all the benefits that a family, that a, a married couple with two kids would get under welfare, and what they would be making at minimum wage. A: And they came out four thousand dollars better a year, by taking welfare. B: Yes. A: So there's no incentive for them to do anything. A: Far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money. B: Yeah. B: One of the things they tried to push through in Maryland, and, uh, weren't very successful was that if you were an able-bodied person on welfare, you had to do some work. A: You had to do something. B: And, A: Yeah. A: and that's been tried, that was tried in Alabama too, A: and it got shot down. B: Yeah. A: I and I don't understand the reasoning for it. A: I really don't. A: It, it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money, then they should return something to the public. A: I mean, if nothing else, go out along an interstate and pick up garbage. B: That's exactly what they were trying to get them to do. A: Yeah. A: What do they, what do they do in Maryland, A: do they use highway people A: or do they use prisoners? B: Um, both. A: Yeah. A: that's the way they did it in Alabama, too. B: Yeah, B: they use both. A: usually you'd see these big chain gangs out there, picking up trash. B: Uh, they have a, they have another program in Maryland that's called Adopt A Highway. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: we have that here in North Carolina. A: Well, good afternoon to you, Mary. A: First, let me ask you, what's, what's the weather like up there to begin with? B: And good, B: Well, well, today, uh, when I got up it was twenty-nine degrees. B: Yes, B: and it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon B: but it's been cloudy, overcast and threatening rain all day. A: That sounds more like our winter weather down here. B: And we've also had extremely strong winds, fifteen to twenty miles an hour, for the day. A: Um. A: Well, you know, I bet that's what we, that storm we had last night. B: Is that right? A: Oh, we had a frog strangler go sweeping through here, uh, yesterday and last night. A: And we're expecting another one tonight. B: Oh, really? A: Oh, I mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street. B: We had one of those two days ago. But not, uh, but, uh, no rain at all yesterday and, uh, no rain today. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, it's probably on its way up there. A: It was heading north. B: Thanks a lot B: couldn't you send us some nice weather? A: Well, it was nice today. B: Oh, was it? A: Uh, in between the thunder showers, A: yes. B: Well, the, one thing's for sure we can always discuss the weather, B: how some ever we can't do very much to change it. A: Well, you know, what they say about the weather here in Texas? B: What's that? A: If you, if you don't like it, wait five minutes, it'll change. B: Oh, yes, B: well that's about the way our weather is here also. A: Uh-huh. B: And I grew up in Saint Louis, B: and Saint Louis was much the same. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, tell me, uh, is, is it normally that cold up there in, in the Spring? B: No, B: it's not. B: This is, uh, about, uh, ten degrees cooler than usual. B: But about a week ago we were up to eighty and eighty-five degrees. A: You're kidding? B: No, B: no, B: it, uh, it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems. A: You, are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open? B: I'm sure I didn't. B: I was ready to turn on the air conditioning. B: It, no, it really was extremely warm. B: It only got down to about sixty-five in the evening. A: Um-hum. B: We had about three or four days of that, B: and then all of a sudden a cold front came down and, uh, temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short length of time. B: And, uh, it has gone down gradually each day. B: This morning it was twenty-nine, B: yesterday it was about thirty-two. B: Uh, cars were scraping, ice off their cars this morning if they've been sitting out all night. A: Oh. B: So it, it really wasn't too, wasn't too pleasant A: Oh, Mother Macree. A: No, A: I should say not. A: Well, I, I, sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had. B: Oh, I hope, not. A: I hope, it doesn't reach you up there. B: Well, they are predicting rain and thunderstorms, B: and I wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had. A: Well, I, A: let's hope it, A: well, if it's the same as what we had, at least it'll be warmer. B: Uh, yeah. B: Yes, B: warm rain, B: well, of course, by the time it gets up here it may run into a cold front coming down from Canada. A: Yeah, A: oh, boy, A: the, that, whew, that would be tear disastrous. If you, had that rain storm and freezing weather. B: Yes. B: Yes. A: Oh. B: We had, uh, a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the, uh, of the city of Dayton itself. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour. B: It was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal of lightning. A: Oh, yes. B: So, it, it wasn't, uh, it wasn't conditions to being out in it B: and I had just gotten home. B: We had a lot of tornado warnings also. B: And I had gotten home shortly before that, uh, the rain started. B: So, uh, I felt a little more secure that I was at home rather than having to be out driving in it. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, uh, I heard on the news this morning that, um, one of our local schools, uh, lost the roof of their gymnasium. B: Is that right? A: And they suspected may have been a tornado. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, uh, thank God for small favors, the, uh, uh, A: what do they call them? The, the, the marching band or something? B: Yeah. A: Uh, uh, had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before. B: Oh, they, B: that was, very, very fortunate for them because that could have really been disastrous. A: Oh, and how. B: Well, of course this is tornado season, uh, B: in to, uh, B: we have many tornadoes spawned in this area. And northern Indiana, B: now we're in the southwestern part of, uh, Ohio, just forty miles north, due north of Cincinnati, A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, but, uh, northern Indiana, has many tornadoes come roaring across. B: And we get the backlash off of it, if not the part of the tornado itself. A: Uh-huh. B: So, uh, we, you know, we get a lot of bad weather in this area. B: But of course you're supposed to be the sun belt, B: and I do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion. A: Oh, yeah. A: Well, during the winter, A: yes, A: we do. A: Uh, we've had, uh, well, past four or five years, I guess, at least one day during the year when just everything would just close down because we'd have freezing rain. B: Um-hum. A: And, uh, of course people down here, they just don't know how to handle themselves A: and, B: Right. B: Yes, B: I was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed, to, uh, having to, drive in it. A: Well, uh, not only that, A: but, we're, we're don't have the equipment to handle it either. B: Right, B: right. A: Uh, they go out there, B: And, A: and the, A: well all you can do with, with, uh, freezing rain of course, is spread sand on the ice. B: Right. A: And, but, uh, you know, we don't even have vehicles that will do that. B: Um-hum. B: Right. B: Well, uh, well here what they do and I, I contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do, they spread salt. B: And of course the salt does melt the ice, B: but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes, uh, a perpetual problem. B: Oh, it sure does do that. A: Yeah, A: they, well we, they do that down here too. A: They mix the salt in with the sand. B: Well, sand, and, uh, B: but I have learned to do, is, uh, now that I am alone, is, uh, to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car. B: Um, not only in case I need it for that for traction but for additional weight, in the, back of the car. A: Yes. A: Uh-huh. B: And then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that. I don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of, that A: Uh-huh. A: I've, B: but, A: no, A: I'm a dog lover myself. B: yeah. B: Well Well, the dogs don't use litter. B: But kitty litter is excellent for, uh, getting under the wheels of cars B: and what have you and giving you traction. A: I guess it would be. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: it, uh, works out, uh, really quite well. B: Course I have, I have a dog also. B: My son brought me a little Lhasa Apso, uh, for my birthday last Thanksgiving. A: Oh. B: He brought him from Dallas. B: He, A: Oh, wasn't that nice of him? B: Yes, B: that, uh, B: he just thought I had been without a dog, uh, for three years. B: That was long enough. A: Uh, B: He, he had, A: I have, uh, a, a Chowperd myself. B: Oh, a what? A: A Chowperd. B: Now that one I'm not familiar with. A: Well, she's part Chow and part Shepherd. B: Uh, okay. B: Okay, B: that makes sense then A: Uh-huh. A: But she's the best, the best of both breeds. B: I believe, B: Yes, B: right, B: well, I've always had big dogs before. Never had a little dog before. A: Well, June, is medium sized. B: And, B: Yes B: well, Oh, well, I had a German shorthair that was frightened of storms. A: But she is scared to death of thunder storms. B: The minute it would begin to storm, he would just panic. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, I had to push him down when he was fourteen, B: and two months later I had to put my yellow Lab down, because he had leukemia. A: Oh. B: And, uh, then, uh, then there was no point in having all my acreage. B: I had four and a half acres with game preserve on three sides. A: Oh, that must be nice. B: Oh, well, it was great. B: I loved it. B: But then I didn't need all that anymore, so I finally sold that, B: and I'm in a fair size condo. B: And I have a nice size patio. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, so this little dog has plenty of room to run. A: Well, good. B: Yeah, B: and he is a, a cutie B: and, uh, but I've never had a dog I had to keep taking to the groomer's to have groomed either A: No, A: well, now, you know, it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in Miami Beach somewhere. Or better yet, down around Saint Petersburg, Florida. B: And it's, B: Is that right? A: Uh-huh. A: That's what I call home. B: Oh, is that right? A: I lived there for ten years. B: Oh, well I was there once way, way back in nineteen-sixty, I think for just a week's vacation. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, I, that's about the only time I've been to Florida, except passing through on the way to someplace else. A: Yep. B: But, uh, A: Well, I lived there in the seventies. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, I, I love it. A: I have two sons still living down there. B: Um-hum. B: Well, uh, uh, most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in Florida. B: But, uh, I have just, that's just not been my thing. B: We used to always head west or head north. B: Now that I'm alone why, uh, I, uh, prefer to travel overseas if I'm going anywhere. A: Oh, uh-huh. B: And, uh, course there too you never know what the weather's going to be. B: When you, start getting over, to, A: Well, that's, that's why I was suggesting, uh, that Saint Petersburg is got, got to be the finest weather in the world. B: Oh, is that right? A: Oh, I, I loved it down there. B: Um. A: Course you could tell, always tell which were the, the and which ones were the snowbirds. B: Yeah. B: Oh, is that right? A: Yeah, A: the snowbirds were the, B: Okay, B: so I think, I think what we should talk about is, uh, the war. A: Okay. B: The war that just went on. B: See, I, I don't agree with it. B: First of all I don't believe in war. A: Uh-huh. B: And then, the United States has this attitude by saying, you know, thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that. B: And I think it's all independent because, it's, it has nothing to do with the United States. B: You didn't gain anything from it. A: Uh-huh. B: And it wasn't our freedom that you were saving. B: It was just, B: the thing, the thing that, that, that I saw was okay, B: Iraq wants to raise oil prices. A: Uh-huh. B: Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system, by leaving them independent. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And so, when Iraq, you know, saw this, they said let's take over the country, which is a good idea, B: right? A: Uh-huh. B: Then the United States says, okay, our, our oil prices are going to go up. B: And like for example, see, okay, like Lithuania right, they declared themselves an independent country with a president, B: right. A: Uh-huh. B: Russia goes in there, well the main government in Moscow goes in there B: and they kick everybody's ass. B: And the United States doesn't go in there B: and say, listen, they were, you know, named an independent, you know, state with a president and everything B: but we're not going to go into your country. A: Uh-huh. B: But these countries here, which, you know, are, you know, like in NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, B: have you ever read that book? A: No, A: huh-uh. B: Okay, B: NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR there are like three big continents B: and, uh, there's just this area, like around Egypt and stuff, that everybody's fighting over. A: Uh-huh. B: Now the problem is, is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries. A: Uh-huh. B: Right, B: like their immediate boundaries. Like you're not going to go, you know, it's like the Army's not going to go straight into Russia because there you're, you're invading their border, B: right. A: Uh-huh. B: But all the other countries, you can fight about. A: Uh-huh. B: And so the thing is, is that you're wasting so much money to send, you know, B: it's like how much money did the U S spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being, A: We'll probably never know how much it actually cost. B: And you know, it's, it was basically all based on oil because nobody B: actually, like for example, if, uh, let's say if, you know Brazil took over you know, Surinam. I don't think anybody would care. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: You know, and, uh, that's something that, that has been, you know, very, B: because, see the thing is, is like every time that I see a war, I see myself on the front line, and on the other side I see myself again, and I've got to shoot myself, you know. A: Uh-huh. B: I got to shoot somebody that's got the same family that I do. You know, the same relationships that I do. A: Uh-huh. B: And just because I was born here I've got to shoot them down. A: Uh-huh, A: oh, it's never a pleasant thing, A: that's true. B: And, uh, but at least it was, it was over quick B: and there weren't that many deaths. A: Yes A: that's, B: Now the only problem is, is the aftermath, that you're having so many deaths in the border with, uh, Turkey. A: Yes. A: Yes, A: that's really unfortunate, A: it really is. A: I don't know if we stopped too soon, A: I don't, I don't, I really don't know what we need to do about that. B: Well, there's something that, that the U S did right which is say, say, you know, okay, B: let's kick him out of Kuwait, which was our basic goal. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, now, indirectly let's try to overthrow him, you know. A: Uh-huh. B: And they're not going to do that directly. B: But the thing is, is that, they, they didn't go into, into Iraq and say, you know, because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country. A: Uh-huh. B: You know, you can seek, seek asylum here, A: Yeah. B: and you can go there, B: but no way are you going to rule ever again. A: Uh-huh. A: I've been hearing some talk too of trying to bring Hussein up on, you know, criminal charges. A: I don't know if that will ever happen or not. B: Well the thing is, is that first of all they got to, they they have to get him. A: Uh-huh, A: which is very difficult to do. B: And, and there's no way that you can get them, unless it's by force. A: Uh-huh. B: You know. And then you can put him on trial. A: Obviously, he's not going to turn himself in. B: No, B: no, B: I think, I think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in, because there's, I mean there's like, it's like there's no hope, you know, like what Hitler did, you know. A: Uh-huh. B: You know, like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life, but where. A: True, A: yeah, A: uh-huh. B: You know, and so, um, the thing is, is that once you've done something wrong, which is you know, internationally recognized, then you're going to try to get out of it B: and the, there's no way, you know. And especially since he's got inside Iraq for using, you know, chemical weapons and stuff. A: Yeah, A: true. A: Uh-huh. B: And you know like he sent planes over to, to shoot the people down that were on the border with, uh, that were on their way to Turkey. A: Uh-huh. B: He had a couple of them bombarded. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: obviously human life means nothing to him. B: Huh-uh. B: But, uh, you know, he's got, uh, millions of dollars, B: like, I think it was like, I don't know if it was fifty billion or fifty million, which is really, doesn't make any difference A: Oh yeah. A: That's true. A: Past a point it doesn't make any difference. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: that's really, really unfortunate. A: It really is. B: But it's just, it's just that, uh, you know, you know, like the, B: we just put our goals in different, you know, levels is B: like saying, you know, it's like B: yeah, B: sure, B: we need oil, you know, A: Uh-huh. B: and we need it desperately. A: Yeah. B: But the other countries, that, you know, that have oil but not as big, you know, like they say, you know, like when the prices went up and then they went down. A: Uh-huh. B: When they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia, or something. A: Uh-huh. A: Seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally, though, before, before the increase started. B: Well, it, its an advantage. A: Uh-huh. B: You know, it's like you're saying, okay, I can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon and I'm not going to bring them back down to, you know, ninety-nine cents. A: Uh-huh. B: Why, B: because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon, B: so if I leave it at a dollar ten, people are still going to pay. A: True. B: You know, I went down forty cents, A: Uh-huh. B: but I went up ten cents. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: About the lowest I've seen gasoline in the Dallas area is, uh, I guess, about ninety-two point nine now. B: Ninety-eight? A: Ninety-two. B: Oh, God. B: Here it's like, it's like a dollar five. A: Oh really. B: Yeah. A: Well there's still a lot of dollar five places here A: but you can find some that's under a dollar, but not, not a whole lot. A: That's the lowest I've seen. B: But still the, B: I mean, have you ever checked, like, uh, the most money-makers in, uh, in nineteen, uh, ninety. B: Uh, you can see that, uh, Exxon and Amaco and uh, other companies, oh God, I forgot their names, but, uh, Exxon was the number one money-maker, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: and that was just because of, of the last quarter. A: Right, A: I think Mobil was doing very well, too. B: Yeah. A: Well I, I assume all the major, major brands are. B: And, uh, that was, B: I mean and what other companies are, went up four hundred and some percent. A: Uh-huh. B: And that's practically impossible to do now a days, for a company to, to shoot up in that way. A: That's true. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: that's true. B: And, uh, it's just that, you know, people, people take advantage of that. B: You know, like the, the companies are saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when, you know, when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for, we've got to raise our prices. A: Uh-huh. B: You know, but still if you realize that, uh, one barrel has like, how much was it, like, um forty gallons, A: Yeah, A: something like, A: yeah. B: it's got forty gallons B: and they're selling, you know, you know, B: you got to pay forty dollars at least and, you know, for, uh, for one gallon A: Yeah. B: and it's, it was selling like at twenty-five or something. A: Uh-huh. B: So you're making, uh, you know, fifteen dollars profit, easily. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: sure. B: And, uh, everything, B: I mean, and, and, the expenses, you know, of the war, you know, it's like, uh, it's like who's gaining on this. A: Uh-huh. B: Okay, B: because, uh, does, does the U S government own any gas companies, like, like, you know gas stations and stuff? A: Uh-huh. B: I, because, see like for example, I don't know if the British government owns Shell. B: I'm not sure about that. A: I'm not sure either. B: But the thing is like the U S government got nothing out of it. Because, well, you know, it's like the other independent companies, the gas stations, you know, they did. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, then the taxes go up B: and then everybody else loses. A: Uh-huh. B: But, um, you know, they're just, they're just some things that might not be worth it. A: Yeah, A: that's true. B: You know, and, and first of all how many, how many people had to, had to die before the war, you know, B: it's like transporting stuff and things like that, before, you know, it's like A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. B: yeah B: sure, you know, like to, to a couple people that died there, their families don't feel it was necessary to do that. A: Sure, A: dead's dead. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: you, you could, you could never bring them back. A: That's true, A: so. B: Oh well. A: Well, I don't guess we resolved anything A: but it's interesting. B: Yeah, B: so, okay, B: nice talking to you. A: To you too, A: take care. B: Bye-bye. A: Bye-bye. A: All right, A: I, I think our experience of camping is, A: I, I am the, the passive member, A: I get things ready and then I enjoy. B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, because, my, my husband is a good camper A: and so they, A: he manages the troops A: and they do the work A: and I have fun B: Uh-huh. B: Well, uh, uh, your, you said your family was uh, all grown up now, B: how about when they were younger, B: did you go take them camping? A: That's when we camped the most. B: Uh-huh. A: When, A: I thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because, uh, I, it seems like I would go through a period of time where I just, uh, was really overworked, you know, A: and, and getting out into nature and relaxing, and having the family do a good share of the work, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: and the part that I did was more fun than, uh, than labor because they did the, the running and toting chores and I just helped cook and kind of organize, you know. B: Yeah B: even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun, isn't it. A: It is, A: isn't it. A: It isn't. A: what kinds of things have you tried? A: Have you done, uh, uh, uh, the big pot cooking? B: Oh, oh, uh, well, it was really my ex who did the, the, uh, uh, the cooking back when we first started B: and we found that the, you know, what was one, one great handy things was this, uh, uh, uh, hamburger helper. Because all you needed was a big frying pan, A: Oh, yeah. A: Big frying B: you dumped everything in together B: and it was enough for all five of us, six of us. A: Oh, that's interesting. A: You know, interesting enough, uh, the food part was kind of, uh, important thing in our camping. A: Uh, when my oldest son, uh, A: always at the beginning I did all the shopping and everything. A: But the, the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his, uh, uh, cooking merit badge in, A: and, and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff A: and, uh, I mean, you know, he did it up really good B: Oh. A: And so, uh, after he took that merit badge, he did all the shopping and preparing, getting ready for it. B: Well that's great. A: It was, it was a marvelous experience because after that, then all I had to do was, uh, follow the instructions, you know and do. A: And we did a lot of interesting kinds of things A: like I would take corn bread and, uh, cook a pan inside of a pan over a, over a camp, uh, stove. B: Uh-huh. A: And it works real good. A: It's like an oven. B: Well, cooking was our secondary interest, A: Just put, uh, put a thing on it. B: I mean. A: What did you like to do most? B: Well really just commune with nature. A: That's neat isn't it? B: We started out, uh, B: well we were living in Florida at the time B: and we, early in life, we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very, very expensive. A: Right. A: I agree. B: So my ex decided, we're going to try camping B: and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent. B: And that's how we got started. A: Huh. B: We did it for years and years, uh. A: Well now in Florida, is is there are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot. B: Well, uh, B: yes and no. B: I mean, um, in the winter time yes, B: it's, it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, there's really no time of the year that you can't go. A: Oh, is that true? B: Uh, A: Now, now we're, we're in Texas now A: and you're in Texas, A: right. B: Yes, B: I'm in Dallas. A: Okay, uh, A: we have not camped a great deal here because, uh, a good share of the time in the Summer time, it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping. B: Well, it just depends on where you go, B: for instance, if you went down to the sea shore, it would be wonderful, a nice breeze blowing in from the water. A: I A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: we have done that A: But, but we camped mostly, A: when the kids were little we were in, we were in New Jersey, and Uh, in, uh, Allendale and, uh, and, uh, Waldwick, A: it's just about twelve miles south of, the New York border. A: And we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp A: and it was so, you know, pick your own, uh, blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast B: Oh yes, B: yes, A: Uh, also, B: I I come from up in that area, A: go ahead. B: I'm a New Yorker myself. A: Oh, are you? A: Where did you live? B: A little town called Tuckaho, over by White Plains. A: Oh, oh yeah, A: I know that. A: I had a cousin who lived in White Plains, A: that's a, that's a neat area. A: But it's a, that is a particularly neat area for camping because, B: Well that I wouldn't know B: I left there when I was quite young. A: Yeah, A: it is neat though because there are lots of lakes, fairly near by, A: you don't have to go very far. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, and there's, uh, a lot of trees, lot of mountains, and lot of, uh, hiking sort of things A: and, and we had, uh, collapsible boat which we, clipper, little clipper sail boat. B: Uh-huh. A: And so we would sail and, and, uh, did a lot of camping that way. B: Well, uh, me, I outgrew, uh, sleeping bags and, uh, tents, B: and I now have a motor home. A: Oh, do you. A: We've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis A: and it's fun, too, I think. B: Well I live in mine. A: Do you? B: Yes. A: That's neat, A: so you kind of, uh, uh, an everyday camper B: Uh, well, yes B: I consider myself what they call a full-timer. A: A full time camper. B: Yeah A: Well now, are you living alone now, A: or, B: well just me and my dog. A: You and your dog, huh, B: Yeah. A: Hey, A: that sounds great. A: Well, we don't, we don't camp quite as much as we used to, A: but, uh, I still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family, and enjoy nature and, uh, kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life. B: Oh yes, B: definitely. A: I'd always, B: Nothing like the fresh outdoors. A: right, A: I'd always come home just relaxed and, uh, comfortable and ready to go at it again, A: so it was a neat activity. A: Good to talk to you. A: Tell me your name again. B: Jack. A: Jack, B: Uh-huh. A: all right. B: Are you, uh, from Dallas too, Beth. A: yes, A: we've been here, A: we're, we're in Plano, B: Oh! A: but we've been here about, uh, eighteen years. B: Well that's where we, that's where I am, B: Plano. A: Are you, are you, A: how about that. A: Well we're all, lots of people from T I up this way. B: Uh-huh. A: All right, A: good to talk to you. B: Nice talking to you too, Beth. A: All right, A: all right, A: bye-bye. B: Bye. A: Okay, A: how do you feel about them? B: Well, I keep trying to get away from them, B: I used to use a lot of credit cards B: I guess for a while I would use, you know, a variety of the Visa and the MasterCard and the stores, B: but I think I, I impulse buy too much with them B: or I buy things, you know, I see it on sale B: and I think, oh, it's on sale I have to get it, B: and I really don't need it B: or I really haven't budgeted for it B: so, um, the last couple of years I really have tried not to use them at all. A: Yeah. B: What about you? A: Well, we have this philosophy, we use it when we go off somewhere A: but we pay for it as soon as we come back, you know, A: as soon as we get our bills, we pay it off. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: And we only have one. A: We tore all the rest of them up. B: okay. A: Because I don't like credit cards for one thing, you know, A: I mean, they're okay, I guess, A: if you're on a trip or something, you don't have to take a whole bunch of, you know, cash with you, B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: but I don't like using them because I've seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on, chapter thirteen and stuff like that. B: Huh. B: Uh-huh. A: Because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card, you don't have to pay for it. B: That's true B: if, if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket. B: Sometimes you may think, well, I don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: and it gives you a, um, a false sense of security or something it seems like A: because you say, oh, well, I don't have to pay for it now A: but you're going to have to pay for it, A: and it seems like ... B: Yeah, B: you think, well, I don't have it now but payday will come and then I'll have the money. A: Uh-huh. B: But that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time, A: Right. A: Are you married? B: Yes. A: Oh, okay. A: Well, I know that a lot of young people, you know, I, A: it took me a long time to get it through my child's head, A: I mean, that was her goal, you know, uh, got to have a credit card, B: Uh-huh. A: but now that she has one, A: she's only used it one time A: but she wanted to establish some credit, B: Uh-huh. A: but I think it finally sunk in, you know, because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say, you know, well, I used a credit card. A: And my husband's sister is the world's worst at, clothes. A: And, you know, a descent sewing machine will really help her out A: and she's already made, you know, presents and gifts and things for, shorts for me and things for the summer. A: You know, so I guess I can't, you know, we've probably almost paid off the sewing with, uh, yeah, with the savings from that. A: So I can't complain too much, you know, A: she's, she's good about that. A: And, also, we, we dine at home a lot. A: You know, she likes to cook. A: So that saves us from restaurants or whatever A: but, but, she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like money dumped down a drain. You know. B: Right. B: Well, I guess we all have those feelings. A: Yeah. B: I, uh, I uh, I, I go to, uh, B: I pay what I think is a lot of money to go to a karate class, you know. A: Huh-uh. A: You know, but you need a hobby. B: Right. B: Exactly, B: but that to her is sort of like a waste. A: Yeah. A: That's true. B: But she does her nails. B: So, A: I know, A: and those nails are so expensive A: Oh, gosh. A: I was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her nails anymore. A: I guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow. B: Yeah. A: And then she waits for them to get their color back. A: And then she'll polish them again. A: I don't know, whatever. A: So she stopped for awhile. A: Boy, what a difference. A: They buy nail polish every two weeks, A: it's, uh, A: my gosh, B: Yeah. A: And lotion, oh, my goodness, body lotion, B: Oh, yeah. A: we spend more on soft, on, on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things, than, uh, A: she must spend more on one application of body lotion than I do on soap for an entire year. B: Yeah B: Good old Ivory A: Yeah. A: It's funny. B: Um, well, it's for your benefit though, right. A: Oh, I think so, A: she's always soft. A: That's true. B: , so that's helpful. A: Yeah. A: But I think, um, A: I don't know, A: maybe after we're not in school anymore, we'll be much better at saving. A: I think, uh, I think that's, uh, B: Yeah. B: Now do you still own a house? B: You said you owned one. A: I sold my house. A: And that's what's really paying for my time unemployed or whatever. Because the graduate assistantship really doesn't cover, the ten thousand dollars in tuition, really doesn't cover living expenses. Um, B: That's great. B: Right. A: we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job. A: So that makes it hard with, uh, you know, A: we're paying double rent, double utilities, B: Oh, wow. A: and that makes it sort of expensive A: but see, I live within my, I live within my very menial income A: and she doesn't A: She doesn't live within her professional income, you know. A: So I just get a, B: that's the killer, two apartments, A: yeah, A: and then even if we want to see each other on weekends, it's twenty-five, thirty dollars in gas, every weekend, A: and that really adds up too, you know, A: so it gets tough, B: Wow. A: I think, we'll, do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone. A: You know, it will cut our telephone bills, you know, by five, by four-fifths, you know, if she's here, B: Eventually, right. B: I mean you're not going to, B: Right. A: so it's actually tough this year, A: but it will be better in June. A: She will move in with me in June, A: so hopefully our budget will in increase then. B: Have you been married for long? A: No. A: Just since December. B: Oh, wow. B: So you guys really are newlyweds. A: Yeah. A: We're, very newlyweds, A: but that's the, A: we, we're together probably for, um, uh, very close for about six months before we got married. A: So, you know, we lived within, A: though I had my own house and things, you know, we still, uh, we're still pretty close. A: I knew her spending habits A: and they're about the same B: Oh, wow. A: they haven't changed at all, you know. A: My mother always said to me, "Tom, now, the best thing to do is be like you're father. A: Never say a word when you're wife spends money". A: And I was like, well, that's true my dad never said a word, you know. B: Yeah. A: So. B: I actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes. Because I think, you know, um, I sort of feel guilty, you know, given that she makes twice as much as I do. A: Yeah. B: So I say if she wants to go out and buy something, I never argue with her, because she's real good at, you know, sort of . A: I don't argue with her, A: but I just get all, A: it must show in my face. A: Must be like, must be cringes or something, you know, especially yesterday or this past weekend. B: Yeah. A: We met half way between, at her parents house A: and, um, she had on a new pair of jeans A: and she'd gotten all new underwear, A: and I was like, Laura. How did you get all this stuff? A: imitates a woman's "Well, I just got paid." A: And, and I was like, oh. B: Had some money in her pocket, yeah. A: It was there. A: It was burning. A: It had to be spent. A: You know, and I'm like A: and she said everything was on sale. A: Oh, oh, that's good, A: at least it was on sale A: That's good honey, A: I'm glad you bought it on sale A: What else can you say? B: That's right. B: I do recommend the for savings bit. B: They, uh, they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt. A: Yeah. A: I think, A: Yeah. A: You don't notice it. A: I think that's probably a really good idea. B: You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone. A: Huh-uh. B: Yeah, B: so, uh, until you really need it B: and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: see I was, A: when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month, A: one paycheck went into savings A: and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage, and the food bills B: Right. A: and it, A: and I was even able to, you know, to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account, because I'm pretty thrifty A: and, you know. But my wife likes to spend. A: She enjoys, A: so that's fine A: But a A: for savings , I'll have to look into that. B: Yeah. B: that's, that's been our godsend, you know. A: Huh-uh. B: We've had some sort of major emergencies come up, you know, where, B: we also own our own house, A: Huh-uh. B: um, we had an ice storm up here, recently, where it was I mean, it was horrible. A: Yeah. B: I mean, half the city owned trees . B: One-third of all vegetation in this county is just wiped out. A: Oh, really, because of the heavy ice. B: Yeah. A: It broke the limbs. B: Exactly. A: Huh-uh. B: We had to our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately, B: but it cost us, you know, a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down. I mean, just to take off what was broken. A: Right. B: Plus, we went with a friend, B: and they said you know, B: and then the whole ice storm cost us quite a bit of money, even though insurance picked up some of it, still, not all of it. A: Yeah. B: They don't get, you know, A: Huh-uh. B: and that, B: plus B: and then we had a car expense like that same week. B: One of the cars died, you know. B: All of this adds up B: and that for savings really comes in handy. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: I can see that. A: I can that, A: I keep trying to say to her, Laura don't spend so much. A: What happens if something happens to a car, you know. B: Right. A: Oh, well, nothing will happen. A: Oh. A: All right, A: what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over? B: Well, I have a really great one that I make in the summertime because it's cool B: and it's, uh, it's just really pretty easy. B: It's pretty much dumping things in and stirring. A: Uh-huh. B: And I like that. B: Uh, the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in, in it B: and then I, you're supposed to do chicken, B: but I just use those little cans of chicken. A: Uh-huh. B: And it makes it so much easier, B: and so you dump the rice, B: you dump the chicken B: and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape, B: now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off, B: but I get my kids to do that, B: so, A: Oh B: I, I don't have to do that. B: And, um, and it really, B: and you mix it all up with B: there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up, B: but it's so simple B: and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime. A: Oh, yeah. A: You serve it cold? B: Uh-huh. A: Oh, yeah, A: that sounds good. B: Yeah, B: it has to sit in the fridge over night, B: but, but it's really good. A: Um. B: And I like that one. A: Yeah. A: Usually when we entertain we do something really simple, because I like to visit with my company, and not be scurrying around in the kitchen, B: Yeah. A: so, a lot of times, we'll barbecue B: Exactly. A: like, uh, for Memorial Day we had some friends over A: and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's meat marinate, and put it on the smoker and cooked it. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, that sounds good. A: And it was real good. A: You can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way A: and then people think they're eating steak or something B: Yeah, B: yeah B: And these days that helps, doesn't it? A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: Yeah. A: It really does. B: I know what you mean. A: I don't usually I just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because I just know I'll never take the time to do it. B: Now spaghetti's such an easy one. B: Um, I do that a lot. A: Uh-huh. B: I do spaghetti a lot. A: Yeah, A: it seems like most people like spaghetti. B: Yeah, B: I don't like to do that if it's real hot though. A: Yeah. B: Because, um, I don't know, B: I have a real thing about being hot in the, in the summertime. A: Uh-huh. B: I guess. A: Well I think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference, in your whole house. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I think that's right. B: And, um, we don't entertain that often, B: but when we do, I'm like you. I like it to be fast and easy. And something so that we can talk and not and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Most, A: we don't entertain like people from work or stuff often. A: It's usually friends from church and stuff, B: Yeah. A: and it's usually kind of like, you want to come over, and they say well what can we bring. B: Yeah. A: And so it's real easy because you just make one or two things A: and everybody else brings something. B: That's exactly like us, from our church, we just do it, B: yeah. A: Oh yeah, A: yeah. B: Uh. A: It's a lot more relaxing. A: I don't know if I could take the pressure of having to you know, put on this really fancy dinner for someone. B: Well you see all that on T V B: and I could never be that person. A: Huh-uh. B: It just, uh, I'm just not, B: well I'm so, I'm pretty laid back. A: Yeah B: And, uh, you know, so I don't, I know a lady in a, my church B: and, uh, she like does her own bread and does her own stuff B: and so when she, um, does food, she really goes all out B: and I don't know how she can do it and be calm A: Yeah B: I guess, A: Do you work? B: No, B: I don't. A: Do you stay home with kids? B: Uh-huh, B: yeah. A: Yeah. A: I, I've been working, A: we're going to have a baby this summer, A: and I'm not going to work anymore. B: Oh, how exciting. A: Yeah. A: So hopefully, I think I'll enjoy cooking more, when I don't have to work all day. A: I don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up A: and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night, A: so. B: Yeah. B: Well I usually start about six and, an, and cook and then eat at seven. I mean, cook at five and eat at six, rather. A: Yeah. A: Eat at six, yeah. B: Yeah, B: and, uh, my family and I, we're a sit down together family. A: Oh, that's good. B: Uh, yeah, B: I don't like the run in and out part. A: Yeah. B: And I like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me an, and my husband about what's happened B: and, I think I, that was ingrained in me during my family time at home. A: Yeah, A: that's neat. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, you know we could learn to talk about things B: and I think that's good. A: Yeah, A: that really is. A: It keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other. B: Yeah. B: I think, A: Right now we eat in front of the T V A: but since it's just the two of us, it's B: Yeah, B: yeah B: Well that happens to us sometimes too. A: Yeah. B: But, uh, sometimes if something, uh, is on that they want to watch I leave it on, B: but we eat in the kitchen B: and their heads are always poking past the door. A: Uh-huh, A: to see what's happening. B: Yeah. B: Anyway food is, is, uh, a real life-style kind of thing B: and some people don't like to do this B: but I like to uh, cook with my kids. A: Oh, uh-huh. B: And if they're going to have other kids over then, then they help. B: And we make real simple things, you know, those, oh, B: I I don't know if you've ever made them, maybe not since you don't have kids yet, but those Jell-O, uh, gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers, I can't think of what they call it. A: Oh, I've seen those in the magazines. B: Yeah, B: they're so simple. A: Uh-huh. B: And the kids love to do that. B: Uh, finger food is, is a biggie with them. A: Yeah. B: And, and like, now one thing I wish I could find a, a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks, because they love to do that B: and it's just really hard B: and if you have to work with a knife, I don't like that. A: Yeah. B: So, that's, uh, B: they like to eat it, B: but it's a hard one to have to, to prepare. A: Yeah, B: But they like that with the, the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that. A: Oh yeah, A: yeah, A: we like that. B: Yeah. A: That's good that, that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too. B: Yeah. B: My son's getting to be a, a real good cook B: so, uh, A: Oh, neat. B: sometimes he fixes me breakfast A: Oh, wow, that's great B: Yeah, B: I like it, B: I like it a lot. A: How old is he? B: He's eleven. A: Eleven, A: wow, that's good. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: so A: Do you cook like you cook a breakfast every morning A: or, B: Uh, not every morning, uh, B: mostly during the summer it's hit and miss B: and, we usually have like, uh, cold cereal or something like that. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: Um, during the during wintertime when they're in school, um, then I try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a, twice a week or something and then have like, when it's really cold, I even cook oatmeal, Because I like oatmeal A: Uh-huh. B: and the they like it all right. A: Yeah. B: And, um, then sometimes we do something, B: it has to be fast because they're on their way to school, B: we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that, B: but. A: Oh, uh-huh, A: yeah. B: Yeah, B: so, I try to, uh, B: and sometimes we do eggs if I get up early enough to do that. B: I used to do them in the microwave, B: but they don't like that. A: Oh, do they get rubbery, A: or, B: Um. A: I've never tried it. B: It it depends. B: If you let them cook too long then they'll turn a little bit gray. A: Uh-huh. B: You can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray B: and they will be a little harder, B: and I don't like that. A: Yeah. B: So you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in, if you have a microwave book, B: but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a, like a plate over the top. A: Oh. B: And let it steam. A: Uh-huh. B: And then, and then stir it up. A: Huh. B: Yeah, B: an, and that turns out okay. A: Yeah. B: And it's funny 'cause if I turn them out on to a on to like a plate, for them to take what they want, they don't know I've ever done it in a microwave. A: Uh-huh. B: It's really funny, B: it's very deceiving, you know, 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go, uh, I don't like want that, you know, A: Yeah B: and yet if they don't ever see it, then it's like, oh this tastes okay, you know, B: so. A: Yeah. B: Anyway. A: We had, A: my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash. A: Everybody would say we don't like squash, we won't eat squash, A: so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there, you know, B: Yeah A: and then we'd go, oh, this is really good. A: Okay. A: Uh it's not such a bad idea to think about judges, uh, you know, taking the idea of, uh, uh, sentencing into their hands versus, you know, the jury, especially if it's a highly publicized case such as, uh, you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read, uh, certain, uh, things in regards to cases like the Dahlmer case in Milwaukee and stuff. A: So it's, it may be an idea to think about, you know, cost. A: Trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as, uh, they may say they're not biased, B: Yeah. A: but deep down they are against this person or whatever, A: so, uh, I don't think it's such a bad idea to think about. A: So, B: Right, B: that it, that it, B: I, B: a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not and, and, uh, not depend so much on the, on the emotions of a particular case, but be able to put it in overall perspective. A: Exactly. A: Uh-huh. B: Well I, I certainly haven't thought much about this A: Yeah. B: but, A: Catches you off guard, doesn't it? B: Yes, B: yes, B: some of them, some of them do B: and some of them don't, B: but, uh, this one, uh, B: I was trying to remember back. B: It seems to me that, that, you know, when I studied civics in school or stuff, that this, the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't, wasn't so much. A: Uh-huh. B: And I'm, I'm trying to figure out whether that's, I'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state. A: I didn't think they were either. A: I thought the sentencing was done by the judge. B: Yeah. A: I mean, it's either guilty or not guilty. B: Yeah. B: And, uh, I, I guess, B: and I don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some supreme, supreme court decision perhaps that said that, uh, that, uh, as part of the trial by the peers that had to include the sentencing or too, or whatever. A: Changes. A: Uh-huh. B: I, B: yeah, B: but, I, yeah, I certainly wouldn't be, uh, uh, worried about that. B: I guess in terms of the, uh, you know, having a judge do it would seem to me to be more, more fair and and, uh unbiased. A: Oh, sure. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: Uh, in terms of doing away with the, with the unanimous jury, I guess, I guess I, uh, would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in, in the trial system. B: That, that's just a, such a tradition that it's a, that it's got to be a unanimous jury that, uh, I don't know where you'd, where you'd draw the line anywhere else. Uh, you know, uh two-thirds or three-fourths or whatever. A: Exactly. A: Exactly. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, and, and, I, I, I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a, just a bare majority. A: Exactly. B: Uh, A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. A: That's kind of how I, you know, A: in certain cases I can see them going, uh, uh, just basically with a judge, guilty or not guilty verdict uh, simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small, uh, maybe, you did a crime that was, uh, burglary or whatever B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: and it goes into the court case or whatever A: and it's not highly publicized. A: But when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the NATIONAL ENQUIRER or whatever. B: Yeah, B: whatever. B: Yeah. A: Uh, it's the idea that person might initially have this thought, well, jeez this person's guilty no matter what. A: I'm not going to listen to the facts or and, and con their way into, uh, getting past the lawyers and getting through that. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, also there's aspect of cost A: and I, I'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for, uh, the judicial system to try and call a jury, whether it's very costly, or if it's something that's not costly or what. A: You know, being that I'm not in the, that area I really don't know. A: But I wonder if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay. B: Yeah. A: I know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work. Or at least give them the time off from work. B: Yeah. A: Uh, whether it's, A: I think it's with pay. A: If I remember, jury duty is with pay. B: Well, B: And, and I'm, B: I, B: I'd, B: I know it is, I know it is where I, where I work. B: But, I'm not sure that that's, that that's necessarily required. Uh, you know, by law that it has to be paid. A: Paid, right. B: Uh, I suspect that's a, that's a benefit of a bigger company. B: But, but there are certainly some, Some that, some that wouldn't, uh, A: Uh-huh. A: Some that may decide not to. B: yeah, A: Well, I don't know if there's going to be solutions to the U S budget. B: Well, now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure. A: Uh-huh. B: It's only getting worse exponentially it seems. A: Yes. A: Exactly. B: Um, A: There's, uh, maybe some short-term things that they can do A: and it hurts everybody's pocket, of course, A: but, um, I know that state has, uh, cutback, uh, raises for a year to help, uh, the, uh, state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition. B: Uh-huh. A: That, B: Oh, which state is that? A: Uh, State of Minnesota. B: Uh-huh. A: So there's the potential that perhaps, you know, the U S budget might want to take a look at it's, uh, federal employees or, and take a look at saying, well, let's freeze wages. A: I mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like, uh, private business has had to do it B: Uh-huh. A: so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a that's got to be very short term. B: Right. B: Right. A: And the only other avenue that I can think of is, uh, looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying, well, we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money. A: As for, for instance, I think you probably remember the military getting caught, um, with toilet seats that cost them four hundred, five hundred dollars. B: Yep. B: Right. A: And it was just, A: I mean you can go to K-Mart and buy them for, uh, eight dollars or I think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats, B: Yeah. A: so. So it gives you idea that, B: Yeah. B: Definitely B: I think that there's probably a lot of waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place. A: Sure, A: sure. A: So, B: I mean there was, um, people at Stanford who were soaking the government, you know, using millions of dollars of research money to, uh, for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And I think that, that maybe more widespread than well, than we'd like to have think. A: Than we think. A: Sure. A: Sure. B: But, but then it's something that's hard to enforce too I'm sure. A: Uh-huh. A: It sure is. A: The, you know, as far as, A: I think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days A: and actually, uh, the conferences were nothing A: but, uh, you know, they're getting paid for this, A: and it was something more than just the conferences. A: They were using it as eating out, uh, A: when you think about people, uh, taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress. B: Uh-huh. A: The rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that. B: Right. A: And it's a real big crunch, uh B: Uh-huh. A: of course, when they get caught then they're, you know, they're guilty of course, A: but, uh, during that time I'm sure there's hundreds of, uh, thousands of people that are, uh, spending money that does not belong to them. A: So, B: Well, that's right. B: Uh, I think that, oh, politicians talk a lot about waste A: Uh-huh. B: but I'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem. A: Sure. B: I mean when you look at something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows how much. You know, at a million dollars, a pop for patriot missiles. A: Uh-huh. A: Exactly. A: And I don't think, uh, it's ended up being, A: I mean it gave people jobs B: Yeah. A: but I think it also cost, um, quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war, a lot of things were no longer put to use. A: I mean it was kind of like, okay, we'll do this during this point and time A: but after that that's, you know, uh they didn't want to do it anymore. B: Right. B: Uh-huh. A: So, a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things. A: So I don't know. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: Okay, A: well, it was good talking to you A: and have a good evening. B: Okay B: All right. B: You too. A: Uh-huh, A: thanks. B: Bye-bye. A: Bye now. A: Okay. A: What kind of pet do you have, Gail? B: Well, I don't. B: I have children A: Oh, you have children B: I have little children. B: Both of my kids are under two so right now we don't have pets, B: but we've had lots of them in the past. A: Have you? B: Uh-huh. A: Uh, what have you had? B: Well, we had a dog before we moved here. B: Uh, and we couldn't bring her with us. B: We came from Colorado, B: and we've had hamsters and fish and birds. A: Oh. B: Okay, B: I've , A: Well, you're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up. B: Uh-huh. A: Well, we had a, a Schnauzer that we lost this summer, A: and he was fourteen years old. A: And, uh, we've had two Schnauzers A: and before that we had all Dachshunds, A: and I think my husband wants another Dachshund, A: and we're trying to debate because our children are grown A: and, and, uh, I don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a you know, another dog. A: And we do have a very loving cat that's, you know, kind of our baby. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, and we like pets. A: We like them around. A: We have grandchildren that run through A: and they think we should have a dog, A: and that's because they have a Great Dane B: Huh. B: Yes. A: They're just huge B: Definitely. B: Well, we, you know, B: if it, um, if it were just more peaceful, you know, with the little ones, we would definitely have a pet. B: I just think it's nice to have around. B: We had a cat that had kittens. B: So any pet that I get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered. A: Oh, yes, A: yes. B: Because, uh, I did. B: That experience was awful A: Yes, A: I have never wanted to, A: that's why we've never gotten a female, you know, in anything. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, uh, and our male cats, you know, we had, uh, neutered right away, B: to baby very what you doing ? A: and, of course, it, he doesn't know it. A: He's still out partying. B: Oh. A: But, um, you know I do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just had her, have her spayed, you know. A: And, uh, B: Well, a lot of times now when you buy them from like the S P C A or from the humane societies or whatever, their adoption includes their spaying. A: Yes. A: Yes, A: yes. B: So, A: Which I think is a good thing. A: It just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved A: and, you know. B: Uh-huh. A: It, uh, A: plus, uh, you know the safety factor and stuff. A: Well, we enjoy having pets. A: We, uh, you know, I think they're a lot of company, A: and, and when my mother lived with us, uh, the cat was really hers A: and, and he was kind of wild. A: Our, our daughter found her and brought her to us, A: and, uh, that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap. B: Oh. A: And she was the only one at first that, you know, could really hold him, you know, because he was really skittish. A: But it was like he knew you know, B: uh-huh. A: and he would sleep with her, A: and so he was a lot of company to her. You know, and, and just love her. B: Yeah. A: And he's, cats are usually so independent A: but this one you know, he comes up A: and he crawls up next to my husband now, you know. A: He's, A: you know, before the dog died, we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side, A: and the cat would sleep on my husband's side, you know A: And when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row B: My husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us. A: Uh-huh. B: Our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room, B: but our cat would sleep with us B: and he hated that. A: Did he? B: Uh-huh. B: He just thought that they belong, B: and when she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that. A: Uh-huh. B: So, I guess it's probably, probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though I love cats. B: I think it would probably be a dog, B: and it would definitely be an outdoor animal. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. A: I think that's one of the reasons our, A: because as I said our, our Schnauzer was old. A: And so he was becoming incontinent. A: And so then I would just have messes in the house, A: and I think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with, you know. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, yeah. A: And, uh, and it was new carpeting A: and, you know, it just really, you know, upset me no end. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, B: Oh, that would, Greg, uh, B: my husband's grandparents have a dog B: and they just, B: it needs to be put to sleep B: but it's grandpa's dog, B: and, uh, he's really getting too old to take care of it. B: But the dog messes all over the carpet B: and my daughter is just nine months old A: Oh B: and so then she crawls on the carpet B: and, oh, the smell I mean it's just really awful A: Uh-huh. B: and that's, that's one real drawback, B: but you know I guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough A: Yes, A: you will. A: You will. A: You know, we were trying to decide to, you know, about putting him to sleep. A: He was just, you know, he was getting so old and had a, other problems too. A: And, and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier. You know, A: and, and again going through that because our, our animals are almost like our kids in some ways, you know, A: and, and you grieve just as much over them when they go you know, as you would a child. B: Uh-huh. A: And, and, you know, our son and, and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say, get a dog, get a dog, you know. A: Little thing. A: Be quiet, A: be quiet. A: And I can tell my husband, you know, deep down he, you know, he A: Brian in Plano, Texas. How are you doing today? B: Hi, B: fine, B: I'm Nancy. B: How are you? A: Great, Nancy. B: I'm in Plano also A: You're in Plano also, huh? B: Yes, B: we're not too long distance today. A: Well, good to hear. A: I was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania. B: Oh, that was good. B: Utah, I've had a couple of, B: but that was it. A: Really? B: Yeah. A: All right. A: Well, good to hear, A: good to hear. B: Learned about their basketball team A: Which one? B: Uh, Jazz. A: Oh, yeah. B: Yeah. A: The Utah Jazz. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: they're, they're pretty good. A: They've got some good good, some good, uh, good players out there. B: Yeah. A: Well, you ready for New Year's Eve? B: I am. A: Good. A: Should we, uh, start this so we can, B: Okay. A: What was your name again? B: Nancy. A: Nancy, that's right, B: Right. A: and I'm Brian. B: Right. A: Just a moment A: Okay Nancy, then I guess the, today's subject is benefits in the job other than salary. B: Right. A: What, uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as, as crucial benefits? B: Uh-huh. B: Well, I'm a little different than other people because I don't have benefits with my job. A: Uh-huh. B: I'm a nurse B: and I work, A: Oh B: I float so that I have no benefits except higher pay for doing that. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. A: Uh-huh. B: So I find that it makes up for what I pay for insurance B: and I, I make enough money by the hour to make up for that. A: To, to compensate for some of the benefits. B: Right. B: Uh-huh. A: Oh. B: Yeah, B: it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace. A: Yes. B: And then I have my freedom. B: I can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever I want to do. A: Well, that, that's an excellent, A: so actually that is a benefit, uh, B: Well, it is to me. B: Most people prefer the security of nine to five, and weekends off and knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement, A: Yeah. B: and I'm just really not interested in all that. A: Right. A: Right, A: well I guess that's a good point, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: I do belong to a, a large corporation A: or my, that where I'm currently employed A: and there's, uh, there's some different things, uh, one that you've already mentioned is, is health insurance. A: I think through our health insurance that I can get better rates as a, through a group plan as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because I had to do that at one time when I wasn't employed with a large corporation B: Right. A: and that got to be somewhat expensive, A: so I I think one of the benefits I, I see is the, uh, is the group, uh, group discount. B: Yeah. B: Right, B: and especially if you have a family. A: Yes. B: Then I think it makes a big difference. A: Yes, A: and that's, that's one thing I do have. B: Yeah. A: If I didn't have a family, I don't think I would have, as, as a male or as a, as an individual of, in this stage of my life, A: I don't think I would have insurance, uh, other, B: Right. A: I don't think I would go through that expense. A: One other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours A: and in my previous job, I really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where I could go and I could work, uh, nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours B: Oh, yeah. A: or I could do, uh, work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a, you know, three day weekend. And make, uh, make my job flexible in that case. B: Right. B: Could you change that as you felt like it B: or did you have to do it the same every week? A: Well, basically, yeah A: I had to do, that, uh, the same, uh, for about every quarter of the year. A: I mean uh, because I was in a, in a position of management I had responsibilities over people that, uh, I needed to make my schedule, uh, so that if I was not there I would have coverage by some other management personnel, B: Uh-huh. A: so, so I, I think that, uh, that was a, that was an excellent benefit that I really enjoyed B: Yeah. A: and I don't have that in my current operation, A: but, uh, you mentioned, uh, flexible work schedule A: and that's, that's good. B: Yeah. A: And, uh, what other benefits do you think are important? B: Oh, well, I guess, retirement, that kind of thing which I don't worry much about so A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: that's true. B: I just prefer to worry about today, B: probably not a practical attitude B: but that's who I am B: so, A: Well, and that's an individual thing. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: with, uh, with our current, uh, organization, we do have a nice retirement package A: and also a, a nice thing that, that we have in our corporation is a, uh, is a profit sharing plan where we can, uh, participate in the, the profits of the company. If we're, you know, if we've been there a while and we're vested, uh, which means that, you know, we have a, an interest, uh, in the company that we can, uh, get some of the benefits of the, either the profit high times or, or in a sense, suffer during the low times B: Right. A: and, uh, also, uh, in one of my wife's, uh, companies where she worked, they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that, that, A: Okay, uh, A: some of the T V shows I like to watch are, uh, mostly evening, evening shows A: and, uh, like for instance the one I'm looking forward to, to tonight is TWENTY TWENTY. A: I usually watch those prime time programs. B: Right. A: Uh, I like to watch FORTY-EIGHT HOURS. A: Never miss that and, uh, sometimes PRIME TIME LIVE. A: Uh, and then the week goes by A: and I don't think I ever watch anything else. A: You know, the, the Sunday night movies, I watch those kind of things. But, uh, most, but basically a lot of documentary things and, you know, what's going on and that kind of thing. B: I I have a few, you know, favorite shows that I try not to miss. A: Uh-huh. B: L A LAW is one of them. A: Uh-huh. B: Although this year's, it's a little easier to miss than last year. With the new cast and everything. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: it's hard to follow. B: Right, B: and, uh, I like ROSIE O'NEILL. A: Oh, I've never seen that one. B: THE TRIALS OF ROSIE O'NEILL with Sharon Gless. A: Okay, A: yeah. B: She, A: I've seen a, uh, the previews for that. B: It's very good. B: It, it's probably very much a woman's uh, show. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, and then there's a new sitcom on that is, Tim Allen's, uh, what is it, uh, HANDYMAN. B: That's not what, uh, B: HOME IMPROVEMENT. A: Oh, we never miss that, A: or we try not to miss that. B: It's hysterical, isn't it? A: Oh, we think it is, so funny. B: Did you catch the Christmas? A: Oh, just part of it B: I thought it was, you know, B: and it had such a good story, too. A: Uh-huh. B: Did you see the end of it? A: No. B: Well, you know, the little boy, the little one was trying to decide if there was a Santa Claus. A: Uh-huh, A: oh, that's right A: and the neighbor, A: they thought it was the neighbor. B: They thought it was the neighbor. B: He gave the two doubting Thomases a rubber band and a paper clip. A: Yeah. B: I thought that was wonderful. A: And then, uh, it, it's, it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor. B: And, uh, on Sunday, used to be on Sunday nights, now I can't figure out where they've moved it. B: On our, uh, public television, they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show. A: Uh-huh. B: And it showed the latest, uh, developments from all the computer companies. A: Uh-huh, A: I've never seen that program. B: Well, you know, it's, B: unless you're really into computers, you and software, you probably wouldn't be interested, A: Uh-huh. B: but I don't know, A: Uh-huh. B: it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there. A: Oh. B: And, uh, you know, what, they, they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets, you know, and then they also, the hardware. A: Oh. A: Uh-huh. B: So you could see what the new developments were and what to look for B: and, I enjoyed that. A: Uh-huh. B: It was just a thirty minute show with no commercials. A: Oh, okay. B: It's public television, course, doesn't have the commercials during the show B: so, A: Yeah, A: right. B: And I like the FRUGAL GOURMET. A: Oh, I do, too A: Oh, I do, too, A: but I just seem to, to miss a lot of these programs. A: I don't know why. A: I just, A: if I can catch them, I do. Or if I remember. B: Well, there's very few that, you know, my life would stop if I didn't catch. B: But, uh, now I do, B: before I go to work, I tape my soap opera. A: Oh, yeah. A: I watch one A: and, B: Well, I watch two, B: but one's a half-hour B: and one's an hour B: and, and they lead into each other. A: Oh. B: And that's the BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL and AS THE WORLD TURNS. A: Oh, okay. B: And I've watched the, AS THE WORLD TURNS since I was a little girl A: Yeah, A: that's been on for years. B: So it's just, you know, B: it's, it's, something I've done for the last probably twenty-five years. A: Oh, and so you get to come home and watch them B: Yes, B: and I don't have anyone else at home, B: so I have freedom to watch whatever I want. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: But I like, I like every, I like the, uh, the information shows B: and I like the comedies B: and you know, and I, I do like good movies. A: Uh-huh. B: I prescribed, subscribe to H B O. A: Yeah A: well, we, B: So I can get some of the movies. A: Yeah, A: that's a good idea. A: We did have H B O, A: but it, we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious, you know. B: It is. A: It's just, B: But I don't sleep a whole lot B: and I, you know, B: at two o'clock in the morning, there isn't anything on regular T V B: and, A: Oh. A: Oh, yes, A: if you're up then B: and you don't get good reception without cable B: and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels, A: Yeah. A: Right. B: so that's primarily why I have it right now. A: Right. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: I, I thought when I got my V C R, I'd probably drop it, you know, B: but that was years, A: Say you did, uh, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one. B: Yeah, B: and, uh, helped my wife replace some carburetors. A: Yeah. B: Some that, she had to, uh, label everything A: She had to label everything. B: Yeah B: because, A: What was she driving? B: It was a Cadillac. A: Uh-huh. B: And they, uh, well, they quit making those, the quieter jet carburetor B: and they quit making it. A: Yeah. B: They rebuilt it B: and it never did, never did run right again. A: Yeah, A: quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right. B: Yeah. A: Uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on? B: Uh, a Maverick and also, uh, a Chrysler station wagon before that. A: Yeah. A: Did you replace just the, uh, bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter? B: Uh, the, B: I'm replacing the, two or three starters on the Chrysler. A: Yeah. B: They, A: The starters are kind of fragile. B: Yeah B: and the, A: Especially if you need a tune-up. B: Uh-huh. B: They kept saying that the that's what Chryslers did, is they wore out starters. A: Yeah, A: well, if they start real easy, you know, you just hit the key A: and it starts up B: Yeah. A: and when it's properly tuned up, that starter will last for a long time. B: Uh-huh. A: See, they built that starter so it would fit every V eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years. B: Right. A: They all take the exact same starter. A: They'll interchange completely. A: I mean completely. A: One starter will fit all of them. A: So they've got a whole lot of torque, A: but to do that, they did it, A: use an underdrive system, A: but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast so it's got, to spin for very long, B: Uh-huh. A: it's kind of tough on the bushings. B: Yeah. A: Usually what goes is the bushings. B: Right. A: You take a little time, replace the bushings, you still got a perfectly good starter. A: But, uh, most places don't put, don't rebuild them with, with with good enough bushings. B: Uh-huh. A: So it's, you know, A: after you get rebuilt one, you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly, especially if you need a tune-up. B: Yeah. A: Anyway, what are you driving now? B: Uh, my Chrysler van B: and it's, it's pretty maintenance free, you know, B: and, uh, at the beginning of the year last year and drove a Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon B: and it didn't give me any trouble at all. A: That's good. B: Yeah. A: It was a late model, A: is that Chrysler van? B: It's a eighty-seven. A: Yeah, A: one of the little mini vans? B: Uh-huh, B: yeah. B: Is a, A: Do you like the way it rides and stuff? B: Uh, rides or runs? A: Rides rough? B: It, B: yeah, B: well, yeah, B: it rides, rides rough, B: it runs good. A: Yeah. B: You know, I kind of, B: it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine. A: Yeah. B: You have to kind of wait for it, especially when you get on the highway. A: Yeah, A: right now, without getting some of the sportier models, uh, the four cylinders aren't real peppy. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years, too. B: You driven American cars all, A: Uh, yeah, A: I've driven one uh, A: I drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while, about a month. A: Uh, in a month I think I put, uh, three oil coolers on it. A: Uh, every time I turned around I was having trouble with it. B: Uh-huh. A: Everything else I ever owned was American built. Uh, mostly older cars. A: Uh, I've been a mechanic, A: well, I worked, starting working my father's service station when I was about, uh, twelve. B: Uh-huh. A: So, I've been around cars a lot, but, uh, driven a lot of old Pontiacs. A: My first three cars were, uh, seventy model Pontiacs. A G T O and a Bonneville and a station wagon. A: I had a couple of Chryslers. A: Had a super B for a while with a four forty in it. B: Uh-huh. A: It was a lot of fun. A: But, uh, B: Not much gas mileage, though. A: I don't know, A: gas mileage wasn't too bad. A: It got about seventeen. B: Oh, wow. A: Well, till you got crazy with it. A: You know, you get the four barrel all worked up A: and suddenly it, it, it drops off fast, A: but long as you didn't spin the tires too much or, or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it, it didn't do too bad on gas. B: Yeah. A: Didn't have to work too hard to move the car around. B: Now, do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs? A: Oh, yeah, A: yeah, A: definitely. B: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: the, A: my last G M car was a seventy Chevy station wagon A: and it still had the points and condenser in it. A: When I rebuilt the engine on that, about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car. B: Yeah. A: I, uh, pulled that old points distributor out and got, an H E I distributor, electronic distributor put into it. A: Well, I really enjoy reading the newspaper, A: we get the daily, uh, DALLAS MORNING NEWS A: and I try to look at it. A: If I get busy I don't get a chance to pick it up, like this week I noticed several copies have been haven't been touched A: but B: Well, do you have time to read the paper in the morning? A: Well, not in the morning, A: but, uh, if the, A: well, I have two children A: and if they, uh, go out to play or something I like to keep my eye on them so I'll, you know, maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something. B: You know, a lot, a lot of people don't take newspapers at all. B: We, we took the MORNING NEWS for a while, A: Uh-huh. B: and then, uh, well, we've been taking the TIMES HERALD for ages B: and then, uh, dog just ran off with my shoe, that's off the subject, went outside, picked it up and ran off. B: Anyway, uh, and then we switched the MORNING NEWS B: but we found we couldn't read enough of it B: and by the time I got home and had time to, to read some, B: but, but I guess the, the issue is, uh, beside the newspaper, do you take any news magazines? A: Well, we, I don't take, like TIME, or NEWSWEEK or anything like that, A: but I do like to watch, uh, C N N. A: I have several chores and things to do, A: so it comes on at, like the nine o'clock p m A: and so I will turn that on while I'm doing some work A: and I can hear the news, not have to sit right down and listen to it. B: Did, did you, did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about, uh, Pete Arnett, and, uh, the, the news coverage? A: Well, he didn't have too good of opinion of it, A: no, A: I mean yes I did hear that A: and so, uh, I do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor. B: Well any, you know, TIME magazine and even the news that, B: sometimes that, B: that's why I like some diversity the idea that, I, we have TIME which, which we take from time to time B: and we, B: the problem is they call up and make this deal, you know, B: and, well we're taking that A: Uh-huh. B: and, and we also hit the Garland, GARLAND DAILY NEWS, B: I guess it's, it comes out sporadically, like, twice a week or A: Uh-huh. B: but I think what's interesting is that if you're, that there, uh, that as difficult as it is, or as, as much as they try, they put some bias, B: I had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group B: and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial. A: Um. B: And that, B: but, and, and, you know, people accuse them of controlling the news he says, you know, we don't control the news we just report it the way we, new generation come up that's more used to it. B: Yeah, B: a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to. A: They have to for international trade. B: Yeah. A: But, I guess it's, it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because of, of, uh, of computers coming into everything. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal. B: I think people need to understand more like what a meter is, instead of how many feet in a meter or something. Just get used to using all the terms. B: Because someone says a kilogram, B: no one knows what that is. A: Everyone wants a, wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a, as, as, as, as a concept to hold in mind. B: Yeah. A: Uh, I, I, I don't see that, it, it, it can change it very quickly. A: I mean we're not the kind of society that, that, uh, that something can be posed upon, uh, by government will. B: Yeah, B: no one seems to be adopting it. B: Metric system, no one's very, uh, no one wants it at all seems like. A: Uh, the, the, the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems, uh, money, dollar, coins, anything like that. B: Yeah A: And, and, and it it obviously makes no sense that we're practically alone in the world in, in using the old system. B: Yeah, B: I, it's pretty tough when you get everything confused, though. B: I think two systems is worse than one, though B: Because, I know, we do a lot of problems and things B: and they're half english and half metric B: and you, you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems. B: just get one. B: I prefer metric, B: but even if it's english, they should just have one. A: Well, I mean, I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day. B: Yeah B: yeah, B: I think so. B: Your, your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination. A: Uh, I mean, there are things you could do. A: Uh, we have signs up on the N I S T campus here, speed limit twenty-five miles per hour, forty kilometers per hour. B: Yeah. A: Uh, but that hasn't been adopted very widely. B: Yeah, B: they have some of those in Ohio. B: There's this one sign's kind of funny. B: It says, uh, metric signs next hundred miles. A: But, I mean, and no one will, will go a step further to remove the english signs. B: Yeah, B: that would force everybody to use it. Or to quit selling tape measures in inches. A: Uh, yeah, A: or, you have highway signs saying speed limit, uh, eighty, eighty-five, whatever would be the appropriate number. B: Yeah, B: I guess a hundred is sixty-two. A: Hundred car is going sixty-two, A: yeah, A: so it would be more like, uh, like ninety I guess, A: car is going fifty-five. A: Uh, you suddenly have a have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now. B: Yeah, B: you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety A: Do, do, do you know, where you are, A: do the schools emphasize the metric system? B: Yeah, B: in the engineering they all do pretty much. A: No, A: I, I, I meant, I meant down, like, in the elementary schools. B: Oh, in the elementary schools. B: I don't know. B: I wouldn't think so. B: I remember a ways back we did like conversions, A: I mean, I think, B: but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system. A: Yeah, A: I mean, I think my children learned the metric system, A: but it doesn't get, get emphasized over the other. B: Yeah, B: they learn how many centimeters are in an inch B: and that's about it. A: Okay, A: we're supposed to talk about vacations. B: Right, B: so, uh, well, uh, what kind of vacations do you like? A: Well, uh, I haven't been to many places, A: but I have a opportunity to go to, uh, Paris, France, uh, with, uh, with my friend in April. A: She is, her, uh, her family, you know, lives there, A: and she's only been there once. A: Her grandmother lives there B: Uh-huh. A: so I'm hoping to I'm praying I get to go. Uh, B: Oh, that's great. A: Yeah, A: it's, it will be probably the most exciting place I'll ever get to go. B: Uh-huh. A: Have you ever been to, uh, like New Mexico? B: Uh, no, actually. A: Oh. B: Why, have you? A: I was curious. A: I was just wondering what it was like. B: Oh, okay B: No, uh, B: I have been to Europe once and to Haiti and, uh, A: Tahiti? B: Yeah. A: Tahiti, A: oh. B: No, B: no, B: Haiti. A: Oh, Haiti. B: Right. A: Where is that? B: It's, uh, well, it's in the Caribbean B: and it's the western half of an island, B: with the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic. A: Uh-huh. B: And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country, most of them third world countries. And study the language and then do a little service project. A: Uh-huh. A: Um. B: So, yeah, B: that turned out to be a really good experience for me. A: So, what did you do when you were in Europe? B: Uh, well, see, I went there when I was in high school, actually A: Uh-huh. B: and I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and, uh, hung out with them, worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp. A: What did you do on the farm? B: Uh, uh, uh, well, not that much B: Just, uh, A: Are you just kind of sight, just kind of, uh, B: Right, B: I mean, I wasn't a great asset to them or anything B: But I, you know, drove a tractor, helped them weed beets and that sort of thing. A: Um. B: And, uh, yep, B: and I went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home B: and that was pretty interesting. B: And while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were, uh, staying for their vacation in France in Nantes, which is on the west coast, like right across from England. A: Um. B: Uh, so, uh, where in France are you, A: Paris. B: Right, B: Paris. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, um, how long do you plan to be going for? A: Uh, two weeks. A: Last time she stayed two months, A: but we're only going to stay two weeks. B: Uh-huh. A: So, B: Great. B: And, uh, A: We're going to take a cooking class there, A: so that might be fun. B: A what? A: Cooking class, you know, A: French cooking. B: Oh, great. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, what else are you planning to do, if anything? A: Museums, you know, A: go to museums and, B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, um, A: Do you go to museums in Europe? B: Uh, actually, no, B: I don't think I went to any of them. B: Uh, the closest thing I did was go to some like, uh, restored castles and stuff. A: Um. B: That, there is some on that west coast of France B: and I went to a vineyard or two in Germany. A: Um, that's neat. B: Yeah, B: that was nice. B: Uh, um, but, so, uh, A: Hey, A: what about, A: have you ever been to Hawaii? B: Uh, no, B: I haven't. A: No? B: Have you? A: No. B: Okay B: Well, uh, well, A: I'm wanting to go there. B: Where have you gone first? A: Oh, where have I gone that's anywhere. B: Yeah, B: I mean, A: Uh, B: All right, B: well. A: Um, short term, I don't think anything's going to be done about it or probably should be done about it. B: Right. B: Uh, are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term? A: Uh, the short term, the recession is getting, getting top attention. B: Yeah, B: I, I think that you're absolutely right there. B: The other thing is, is that we've got these, um, these, all these bank defaults going on, and, and savings and loan defaults, and, and, uh, uh, A: And that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not. B: Right. B: Exactly. Um, A: And that's got to be paid. B: Exactly, B: and, and, uh, so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come. B: Um, I'm not really, uh, sure that I even understand why the administration is proposing, for instance, tax reductions, because it seems to me that if, if, if they're talking about reducing, uh, the tax that needs to be paid, or the tax that's currently being paid, then that can't, it seems to me it can't possibly, you know, help with the, the deficit picture. A: It can only hurt the deficit picture. B: Yeah, B: exactly. A: Um, and the, the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without, uh, bringing on, on serious problems for the longer term. B: Yeah, B: exactly. A: So that, that, that's the current predicament. B: Yeah, B: it seems like it's, it's a kind of a Catch Twenty-two. B: I mean, it's, it's the, um, B: my understanding is what they're what, what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy, the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes, they'll have more money to spend, uh, B: and if they have more money to spend, then that will be a spur to productivity, particularly commercial productivity, uh, which in turn will generate revenue. B: But it, it seems like, like, uh, it's sort of a, uh, a an unending spiral, B: and it, it, it, uh, B: I'm, I'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the, uh, the idea that, that, uh, that decreasing taxes, particularly the kinds that are being recommended bye-bye the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to, uh, result in substantial amounts of money, you know, for consumers to spend. B: And, uh, A: Yeah, A: I'm not sure how I feel about paying on the quest, the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point. A: It's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is. B: Yeah, B: it, uh, it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do. A: Well, well, first of all you look to the Fed to fight the recession as indeed it has, with interest rates. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. B: I think that's been a positive development. B: I think what that's done is it's, it's, it's help keep inflation from, um, uh, A: Well, at the moment we're doing very well on inflation. B: Yeah, B: exactly. A: That's the sort of upside to the deficit. B: It's a sort of a piece of luck. A: That's the upside to the recession. B: Yeah, um. B: I don't know, B: what kind of things do you think can be done in, in, uh, in the long term? A: Well, can be done or will be done are two different things. A: Um, at various places to look for, for cutting the budget, first of all I consider more defense cuts than are already planned depending on the world situation. B: Sure. A: But there are various other areas such as, as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed. A: Uh, a lot of entitlement programs, like education aid, I think, uh, they should put a, in A: the Reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: in the longer term, uh, we, we, we'd do well, I think to make, to make, uh, reductions there. A: Also somewhat is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed. B: Right. B: I think that, I think that, that I agree with you certainly in the second situation, B: and I think certain entitlements I, I'm inclined to agree with you, too. B: Education happens to be one place where I think that we would foolish to um, uh, A: A lot of education aid has gone to so-called trade schools which are sort of not colleges B: Uh-huh. A: but schools that teach you trades, you know, beautician well, and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition, uh, and the school gets paid off immediately, uh B: Oh, I see, I see what you're saying. B: And then they and then the people default on the loans. A: and then they don't provide very much education. A: Yes. B: Well, I would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that, uh, around, uh, B: and I, I, I can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing, B: but, but taking what you're saying at face value, then I would have to agree with completely. A: Yeah. B: Okay B: what kind of foods would you have? A: Okay. A: Um, well, I like to cook, um B: Oh, I do too A: but I don't like getting too awfully fancy about it, just because, um, uh, it's too much pressure. You know, B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: if I have people over for dinner, I like it to be nice and relaxed. B: Yeah, B: you can't enjoy it. B: Right. A: Yeah. A: And so I don't like to arrive, or, or when they arrive, for me to be completely worn out. B: That's, that's what, B: I like doing things like making lasagna just because I can have it ready and baking in the oven, A: Yeah. B: it's, A: Exactly. B: everybody just says how wonderful it is, B: and it's it's like, uh, yes, A: Uh-huh. B: I. A: Yeah. B: That's one of those things I got famous for in college. B: People would come and say could would you come over and make lasagna for me A: Uh-huh B: It's like, well, I can't really give you a recipe, uh A: Uh-huh, A: you'd just do it. B: I can I can just do it A: . B: I like doing that kind of stuff. A: Yeah. B: And it's, it's fun, B: in fact that's what we had for a Christmas party last week. A: Uh-huh. B: We just had a bunch of people over B: and we had, we did lasagna and garlic bread and, uh, yummy. A: Um. Boy I like that. B: Uh, I do too, in fact A: Yeah, A: well I'm planning a, A: and naturally this is appropriate because I'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night. B: Oh. B: Oh, good. A: So Tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether. B: Uh, actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays, just because it's a, real easy, is just baked potato dinners. A: Oh, yeah, A: uh-huh. B: And have, you know, like three or four couples come over, B: and I'll do the potatoes and you know, like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings, whatever they like A: Uh-huh. B: and it turns out great, because I mean, you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and, you know, bacon and all that good stuff. A: Yeah, A: that's fun. A: Uh-huh. B: But it's, it's inexpensive A: Yeah. B: plus it's real easy on the hostess, because you can just have the potatoes ready, and just have a salad with it, B: and you got a great dinner. A: Yeah, A: that's a good idea. B: It's, it's real easy, B: I like doing that part. A: Yeah. B: I'm in favor of very little clean up, um, very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games, A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. B: and it's, A: Uh-huh. B: we invariably end up at my house since I've got two kids. A: Uh-huh. B: And that, it's, it's fine, because then I can just say, Okay fine, B: you bring this, B: you bring this, B: you bring this, B: we're done. A: Yeah. B: And it's pretty cool. A: Yeah, A: that's good. A: Well, one of my favorites if I don't want to have other people bring stuff, I just want to treat them is to make chicken and rice. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh. A: It's very easy to. B: Oh. A: You don't like it? B: Oh, I love it A: Oh, you do, A: okay, A: yeah. A: I have a really easy recipe for that, where you just brown the chicken A: and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan, A: you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it B: Um. A: and, and you put the chicken in, then pour the, uh, broth over A: and you can put mushrooms in if you want, A: and then you just. B: Over the uncooked rice? A: Yeah, A: over uncooked rice B: Oh. A: and you can either microwave it A: or do it in the oven, A: and it just. B: Oh, how neat. A: It fluffs up, A: and it's really moist. B: Huh. B: Now I've done it with, where you put, you cook the well, I guess you probably could do it same way, but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup, and put a little bit of white wine in it. A: Uh-huh, A: wow, A: yeah. B: And every once in a while, I'll put in, I'll slice white grapes B: and I'll put in there, B: and, that's just because I'm not a real big wine person B: but I like it, B: it adds something to the chicken. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: And then just bake it, B: and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice. A: Well, I'll keep that one in mind. B: Yeah A: Yeah. B: It's, that was one of the first things I made for my husband, because I was like, um, B: yeah A: Yeah. B: I could actually find something I could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: you can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner, B: Oh, yeah. A: or, you know semi . B: But then, I hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice. A: Yeah. B: So, just, like in a thirteen by nine pan. A: Yeah. A: You put in, um B: Um. A: let's see, what was it, three quarters of cup of rice A: or, B: Um. A: It depends on, A: you can really vary it. B: Uh-huh. A: But you have to put the water in proportionally. A: I can't remember. A: I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water, two cups, um, broth. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: I, I use that for for rice B: and for when I cook pasta or something, I'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor. A: Yeah, A: flavor. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: Um. Now that would be good. A: Uh-huh. B: How long do you have to bake it? A: Um, let's see. A: I think it was an hour. A: I've done it in the microwave so often lately because, it's, it's really easy. B: I do, I do microwave too, a lot A: Yeah. A: But, I think it's about an hour. B: How long would it be how long would it be in the microwave? A: Or maybe it's only half hour. A: Um, you just, A: until the rice looks fluffy, and and not overdone. You know, before it gets overdone. B: Oh, okay. B: Okay. B: Do you just brown the chicken to get it colored A: Yeah. B: or do you go ahead and let it cook through? A: Um, I'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster. B: Um. B: Ooh, this is a beneficial call. B: I like this A: Yeah, A: I liked your idea too, there. B: Yeah, B: but that one's an easy one. B: It's like, just put in, B: a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the, with the soup and the wine A: Uh-huh. B: put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that, you know. What ever, however much effort you feel like putting into it. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: But it, it makes a great, B: I mean, I've got a two year old and a four year old B: and they love it. A: Uh-huh. B: And, because my daughter calls it her gravy B: and I mean, she thinks it's wonderful, B: my, good, you're a picky eater, if I can get you to, A: Uh, did you watch the Bulls this morning? B: You know what, B: I watched a little bit of, uh, of the Bulls game B: and I, uh, had to leave. B: Uh, in fact I, I think the Bulls were ahead when I, uh, when I left. B: Who won the game? A: They won in a squeaker. A: They won by they won by two points. B: Is that right? A: Uh, they were behind as they headed into each quarter A: and then they came back in the second half A: and at the end, I think they were, uh, looked, they looked like they were closing it out A: and then Detroit kept coming back A: and uh, Isaiah missed a three point attempt, at the end B: Uh-huh. A: and, uh, I think the Bulls won by two. A: I think they do, as a matter of fact. B: Yeah. A: One of the, uh, commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would, uh, if they continued at their current pace, uh, set an N B A record for seventy wins in a season. B: Wow. A: Yeah, A: they looked real good A: and, B: They, they do, B: and they, you know, B: I think by, uh, by relieving some of the pressure off of, uh, of, uh, uh, B: Michael Jordan really helped them out. B: You know, he doesn't have, they don't have to rely on him to score you know, thirty or forty points at every at every game A: Right. B: so, A: Yeah, A: well, they, they're, they're balancing their attack B: Oh, I know, B: I'm, B: yeah, B: I saw the I saw the Warriors, uh, just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors, uh, Dallas game. A: I saw the, the second half of the game last night A: and they were impressive. B: They look good. A: Billy Owens looks like he was, A: that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him. B: Yeah, B: now, I don't, uh, I haven't kept up with what was going on with, uh, with the, A: Well, they traded away, uh, Mitch Richmond, A: or is it Tim Hardaway. A: One of the two, uh, who, along with, uh, Chris Mullen was, you know, A: though three were three of the best in the N B A, A: and and, they made a heck of a threesome B: Uh-huh. A: and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens A: and, uh, B: Good move. A: Yeah, A: oh, yeah, A: he's really worked out well. A: They've got the Warriors have got a team, uh, A: and, uh, I think that will be real interesting to see what they can do. A: They're ahead, A: and the Lakers are down, I guess in fourth, uh, position in the west A: and I don't know, B: Yeah. A: in the east, I don't know, uh, A: is it Boston in, uh, first place? B: Uh, I think Boston's in first. B: Uh, I, you know, I haven't kept up with any of the other, uh, teams. B: I'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks, you know. A: Boy, A: they've had a hard time. A: They said they've lost a lot of squeakers. B: Oh, man! B: That, B: well, yeah, B: but, I mean, just this whole year has been just disastrous for them B: and, uh, you know, they're going, I, I think they're going for an all time record of how many you know, losses in a row they can, they they can, uh, pull out. A: Yeah. B: It's unbelievable. A: How do people in Texas deal with Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. A: Do you, for example, like San Antonio in Dallas? B: Uh, B: Well, actually, actually, the, the, the Dallas area here, uh, pulls for Dallas. B: Uh, San Antonio pulls for San Antonio, B: and Houston pulls for, for the Rockets. A: So there isn't much crossover, huh, B: There really, B: I mean, not a whole lot. You know, B: I mean, you find them, they're, find them be, to be pretty loyal, uh, in, with the local teams. A: Yeah. B: Uh, you know, it's kind of, I guess it's kind of like, uh, there in the Bay area, you know, you don't find a whole lot of, uh, of Sacramento fans. A: Yeah, A: it's true, A: because San Antonio isn't that close to you, are they? B: Really isn't, B: uh-uh. A: No. B: It's, you know, it's, it's about the same, uh, same distance from here to to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento. A: Is it? A: Yeah, A: so it's not something you'd drive, B: So it's, yeah, it's not really a local, you know, A: Yeah, A: I was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing. B: Uh, he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio B: and they, I mean, they have got a great club. You know. A: They've done a good job. A: I mean, of course, drafting a franchise like him certainly, B: Yeah B: Yeah B: that always makes a big difference. A: Yeah, A: I mean, that's B: So, A: I think the way it, uh, I think that's the way it works now in basketball. A: You, you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and, you know, uh, Bird for the, for the, uh, Celtics B: Yeah. A: and, B: And, you know, uh, you know, I used to think that, that one, one player really doesn't make a club, B: but it really does, you know. A: Well, it , B: You get somebody like Magic B: and you can see the decline in that team. A: Well, yeah. B: Once he left, you know, it's, it's just not the same, uh, it's not the same team. B: There's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for. A: Well, I think you're right A: and I think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit A: and I think those things do make a difference A: and there are marquee players. A: And I think I think Jordan and the, and the Bulls have to be, uh, considered the likely favorites. B: Oh, yeah. A: I don't know who would meet them in the west. A: Uh, I don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year. A: They were so B: Who won that Portland game? A: You know, I wasn't, I, I I watched only a few minutes of it A: and I wasn't paying attention. A: Uh, and so I don't know, uh, B: Uh, A: But Phoenix, you know, Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs A: and, B: Well I guess we're, uh, forced to finally, to do a lot about air pollution. B: I hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars B: and low polluting fuels are being experimented with Ethanol and other types of fuels. A: Yeah, A: one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from? Or sources. B: I, you know, I assume, that the major sources are cars and factories. A: That's what, I would think. B: But I, I don't know for sure. B: I just know that, um, acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from, would B: comes over the border from us. A: Right. A: Yeah, A: I think the automobile definitely is an area and any, any industry that burns, you know, A: and then I don't know about chemical pollution. A: I'm not real into that as far as how it affects the air. A: I know we have a lot of chemical, the indoor type pollution. A: They have offices that are too well insulated. A: They found people are getting sick, B: Yeah. A: but I don't know if that affects outside. A: You know, I, I think, seems to think, seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside A: and the thing I can, the only thing I can think of would be cars and factories. B: Yeah, B: the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes. A: Yeah. B: Um, I guess there's been a lot of pressure to, um, do away with the C F C's in these spray bottles which, has been a real problem. A: Right. A: Yeah, A: that is, well that's destroying the ozone, isn't it? B: Again I, that's what I hear B: and, and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone, there's a hole in the ozone or not B: but at last I heard it was, uh, discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought, initially. A: Yeah, A: that's A: It's kind of scary. B: Well, it is scary B: and I think it will, uh, continue to force us to clean up our act, literally and figuratively. A: Yeah. B: We've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment. A: I think something too that you probably see in older states, all we, we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces. B: I, I, I'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't, do that. A: I think it will. B: In Los Angeles they're apparently going to, B: they've passed laws that, for habit, do you think this could possibly be prohibit? nothing elseseems to make any sense?? for example, people using, uh, barbecues *listen for habit prohibit gasoline lawn mowers, um, A: Uh-huh. B: and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles, B: and, it's gotten bad in Denver A: Right. B: and, and, uh, it's not too bad around here although you see it, you know, more and more in the sky. B: And people in this country are really wedded to their, uh, cars, A: Right. B: and our economy seems to, B: and this I think is one of the big problems, A: Yeah. A: In this area too since, you know, in Texas we're so spread out, B: Yeah. A: we have to drive so far, A: but I know in Colorado I have witnessed that where it just, uh, it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts, A: but we're even getting it here. A: We can drive into, when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas A: and you can tell it in the mornings too. A: My husband likes to go out and jog A: and there's just a brown fog here A: and we don't even have any mountains that are, holding it in. B: Yeah. A: But they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together, the worse it gets. B: Well that makes a lot of sense. B: I mean I, I hadn't thought about it that way B: but it, it, A: You don't have to have mountains that are stopping it. B: Yeah. A: And, uh, they make, uh, making more and more high-rise buildings A: and, uh, so yeah, A: we can comment A: and we didn't see this a few years ago. B: No, B: and I think, A: It was pretty clear here. B: Yeah, B: and I think that, that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth, which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it, is a, is an organism of sorts, and that there is a, a whole set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it, it's going to tell us about it, A: Right. B: and, uh, we're going to feel it, B: and I think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy, uh, in this country, uh, whether people are willing to get out of their cars, A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: and in this country, uh, the, the solution that, that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable. B: For example, taxing people heavily for using their cars. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, I have a little sports car that I enjoy using B: and I know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive B: but I think, uh, we're going to have to make some fundamental changes B: and, and I'm, I'm not sure how long it's going to take or what it's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and, houses we sell. A: Yeah. A: And it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car, just one person in that. A: It's a lot of waste A: but, A: Okay, Eric. A: Uh, are you married A: and do you have a family? B: Uh, yes I am to, uh, both questions. A: Okay A: and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances. B: Uh, yeah B: we do. B: We, uh, uh, B: basically there's the, you know, the expenses that are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every, every month A: Uh-huh. B: and we, uh, enter those into, uh, into a spread sheet B: and, uh, whatever is left, uh, after that we, you know, we sit down and agree on kind of what, what sort of range we are going to generally going to shoot for. A: Uh-huh. A: I see. Uh B: So what do you do? A: Well, that's basically what we do. A: Uh, about every, every three months or so, we re-evaluate our budget A: and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest B: Uh-huh. A: and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks. A: I work part time at night B: Wow A: and he works, and my husband works full times days A: and so we have four checks, A: but that works out nice because we get paid every week A: and so that does help, B: Yeah. A: that helps a lot. A: And then, uh, we don't have a lot extra for extra spending, A: so it's pretty well ear marked. B: Yeah. B: All allocated out. A: Yeah B: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Every penny is ear marked A: but, uh it, we have found that works the best A: and and so if we can just divide them up, all the major bills up. A: In fact, we found it easier to divide the major bills up, you know, cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half, A: but and divide those up between all, A: uh-huh. B: All the checks, B: yeah. A: And so we are not taking a huge sum out, out of one A: and then the next pay check we're real short A: or, B: Right. B: Yeah, B: we found that, uh, it's definitely helped, uh, get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses. A: That's true. B: We were, before we started doing that kind of a thing, we were, uh, spending, uh, money for things that, you know, B: we kind of tended to eat out a bit more than we should have, A: Uh-huh. B: and it was easy to, uh, let things get out of hand. B: We thought it uh, thought it to be really helpful. B: We have gotten some of our loans paid off really because of this and stuff like that A: Yeah. B: so, A: Well, it helps you to focus where your money goes B: Yeah A: and and I am sure you felt the the same frustration before you got on a budget, A: but you're wondering my, when you put down all the money that you do bring in A: and then you're saying, my word where did all that money go. B: That's a lot of money, B: but A: Where does it go? B: Yeah. A: Uh B: But, A: and also we have found that if we write down, A: and we did this. A: We are not real consistent with this, A: but we did it for about a month A: and we wrote down everything that we bought when, you know, every pay check B: Uh-huh. A: and so we could see where every penny went A: and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend A: and like I say we haven't been real consistent with it. A: It's, A: we should cause it does help. B: Yeah, B: the other, the other thing that that we've found that helps is, you know, we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit A: Uh-huh B: it's just to, uh, uh, get up the money in advance and put it in, uh, uh, so long as it wasn't you know, unreasonably high, but for things like food expenses or whatever. Just put it in uh in an envelope or whatever if the entertainment amount was gone for the month say, oh, it's gone A: Uh-huh. A: just stick to that, A: uh-huh. A: That is, A: Yeah. A: That that sounds like a really good idea. B: So. A: And it really helpful. A: Uh, have you developed a savings plan or I R A s or anything like that yet? B: We, we haven't. B: We our our initial goal was just to retire debt, uh, completely retire debt for car payments and credit card uh, credit card debt and all of that. A: Oh, uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: We are just at a point where, where we could start thinking about it B: so A: Oh that's good. A: That's a good feeling B: Yeah. B: Well I A: My husband just graduated from the university, uh, a year ago B: Uh-huh. A: so finally finally we are getting to that point too. B: A student. A: So, are you still going to school A: or, B: Yeah, B: I am actually in the, in the A: Kay. B: Okay. A: I guess we're talking about exercise, huh? B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Well first of all I, I have to ask you how, how old you are? A: Oh, I am twenty-seven. B: Twenty-seven, B: okay. B: Well, I am quite a bit older than you are B: But, no. B: I think exercise is extremely important B: and I I do exercise on a regular basis. A: You do? A: What type of exercise do you do? B: Well, I do, uh, jazzercise which is an aerobic, uh, program that, A: Oh you do. B: are you familiar with it? A: Yes. B: It's, uh, you know, a national company B: and we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes like all day long B: so you can, A: Are they different from aerobics A: or is it the same thing? B: No B: it's really, it's an aerobic routine. B: you warm up B: and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting, you know, slowly and then working up to, uh, you know, a high heart rate B: and then you gradually go down again. A: And you do that every day A: or, B: No, B: I only do it probably two or three times a week. A: Oh, okay. B: The minimum they want you to do is three times a week. A: And this is a club A: or, uh, do you belong to a group? B: Well, it's really a B: I mean it's called a center B: and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time B: and then you just go in whenever you can. B: So, like I usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings. A: Do you go with friends A: or do you go alone? B: No, B: I go by myself B: and that's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me A: Yeah. B: and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise B: or they might play tennis A: Uh-huh. B: and since I am not a tennis player, uh, you know, I don't get that, B: but I am, you know, I am between, I am in my late forties A: Uh-huh. B: so, uh, there aren't many people, you know, that want to do that. A: Oh B: Most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers. You know, with with children between the ages, A: Oh yeah A: young mothers or, B: Young mothers. B: You know, young women, with small children are the ones that I find. A: Uh-huh. B: Well, what do you do? A: Uh, I really don't have a routine. A: I like playing basketball. A: We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop A: and that's what I do every day. B: Oh, great. B: Yeah. B: Do you play every day? A: Yeah, A: pretty much. A: When my wife lets me. B: Well, now who do you play with? B: Do you have friends that play with you B: or just, A: No, A: I just shoot around by myself. B: Yeah. A: And, uh, that's about it. A: I use to play soccer a lot in high school, A: but when I graduated I haven't done much. A: I don't have a problem. A: I know I have to do more aerobics, A: but I don't have a problem with weight. A: I could eat all day and not gain an ounce B: Well see, that's, that's really good B: and I think that keeps a lot, some people from exercising. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, I don't have a problem with weight either, B: but I think I don't have a problem because I exercise. You know A: You do exercise. B: I mean, people are always saying to me, how do you stay thin B: and it's because I exercise A: You do it B: but I also watch what I eat. You know, A: Uh-huh. B: but you'll come, B: being twenty-seven, you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet A: Yeah A: and I B: but as you get older you will. A: well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days, A: but I don't know B: Well, it might not B: Mine, B: because everybody's been telling me that too B: and so far it hasn't happened, you know, B: and I, I just feel like, you know, you have to constantly weigh yourself and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know, too high. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I guess I enjoy sports a lot A: so that's why I've kept active in that way. B: Yeah. B: But you don't play any other sports but basketball? A: Uh, basketball, A: volleyball, uh, A: too bad it's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby, A: I do that. B: But, do you ski? B: Being in Utah, I was wondering if you ski. A: Uh, I use to, A: but it got too expensive, A: so. B: Oh did it really? A: Yeah. B: Cause I know that skiing in Utah is, is suppose to be great. A: Yeah, A: a lot of people do that B: Yeah. A: and but, well I just I never find the time. A: I had rather do other things. B: Yeah. B: Well, I have never skied before, B: but I have friends that go to Utah all the time B: and they think it's really A: Oh they come up here. B: and they ski. B: I guess there's a place where you can ski, B: well is it Tahoe? Where you ski from, B: no B: that's Nevada to California I guess. A: That's in Nevada. A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I am thinking about where you can ski over the state line. A: Oh, yeah A: but, B: But there's a there is a place in Utah called a funny name. A: There's Snow Bird or Alta. B: But it's like, Oh, Heavenly. B: Is that it? A: Heavenly? B: Yeah, B: I think it's called Heavenly. A: Huh. I've never heard of that one. B: You've never heard of that? A: Huh-uh. B: Well, maybe it isn't in Utah. B: But they said they've skied Heavenly B: and it sounded like, you know, that they skied really well, and when they are actually talking about a place. B: It's kind of funny. A: Do they exercise much or, I mean for skiing? A: I know when I went, you can get sore easily A: but, B: Oh yeah. B: You can get really sore. B: I know you, B: I mean I've talked to people, B: but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore. A: Oh yeah. A: is one or two timer a year if I do go on them A: and I am really sore after. B: And then, is it your quadriceps that are the worst? A: Yeah. B: In your legs and, A: My legs really, really ache. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: But, that's, A: I am using muscles that I have never used before. B: Well, B: and it's strange that you can do, like I did aerobics, you know, all the time B: and then I went horseback riding B: and still I was so sore B: and I couldn't get over, A: Actually, to tell you the truth, I think, uh, jury selection is a, uh, prime, uh, discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on, uh, uh, finding of, uh, guilt. B: Uh, I certainly can't argue with that. B: Definitely does need some improvements. Uh, B: and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to. A: Yeah, A: I think there's a limit on that. A: The, uh, the, uh peremptory challenges are limited to, I don't know how many, B: I think it's, Four or five, A: but you can, B: I can't remember which. B: I was on a jury trial last year B: only I got kicked out as, uh, the last selection that the, uh, defense got. A: Um. Yeah, A: it seems to me I'm always challenged peremptorily also when I go to these things. A: I think I have a severe demeanor or something. B: Um. A: Uh, B: That, uh, A: But, typically, you know, uh, typically, uh, everyone gets involved in, uh, the jury process A: and I suppose an elitist might say, well, you really want someone who is well educated to be able to, to winnow the facts from the, from the prejudice. B: Right, B: but it still has to be a group of your peers. A: Right. B: See. A: So, B: So, if it's your peers and you're not educated then, A: So if you're a nincompoop on trial, you'd, you'd have to have nincompoops to, uh, B: You want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them. A: Um. B: So, that's why the defense is there picking through them, whereas at the same time, the, uh, the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him, uh, a guilty verdict if the facts warrant. A: Uh-huh. B: So, uh, I think the jury selection process is pretty neat, B: but I don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment afterwards. A: Um. B: I think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have. B: you're talking about, the person's already been found guilty, right A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: and many times I've seen on trials they have on T V, the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever, B: but I think that it should be up to the judge and the, uh, lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be. A: Um. B: Maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, and I think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure. As opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure. Also, may be a more consistent sentencing procedure. A: Well, I suppose you may be right on that. A: Matter of fact, I've heard that, I've heard that some of the information, uh, is prevented from reaching the jury, like, uh, mitigating circumstances or, or preceding, uh, criminal record or things of this nature that, B: Well, preceding criminal record, according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime. B: But when it comes to, uh, sentencing for punishment, of course, if the person's never done anything bad before, according to the judicial system, then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side, B: and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury. A: Oh, is it? A: Oh, I didn't realize that. A: Okay. B: At least in California, they're supposed to be. B: Not during the trial, B: during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background. A: Right. B: But when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down, I think that, uh, that they should. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't, I don't know that they always have because I never sat all the way through a jury trial. B: They get too boring. A: Uh-huh. A: So, you, what you're saying is this, if there is the second offense, then you execute them. B: Well, if it's a second offense, the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense, because obviously, the rehabilitation process did not work the first time. A: Um. B: So you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better. B: When it comes down to things like alternative sentencing, I'm all for that for, uh, small crimes, infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant, B: you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things. A: What about, uh, white collar crimes like, uh, theft of trade secrets. B: I think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are. A: Oh, really? B: Yeah. A: Like what? B: Well, uh, say, embezzlement, right. B: You get a guy down the street who comes up, uh, carrying a A: Uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials. I, you know, I, I really feel as though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system has been, been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only kinds of things that you can use. Because the, the jurisprudence is, you know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated body of law. A: And if, if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they, they start, they could start going back and digging up all these cases that, uh, that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards. A: So I, I really don't think it, they can really do much of anything to change it. A: What do you think? B: Uh, I, I don't think so. B: Possibly in the jury selection would be the only, B: just for example, what we're seeing in California I guess. B: It makes you wonder, uh, had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome. A: Well won't, A: well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that A: but then then, you know, the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently B: Uh-huh. A: and, you know, the other two guys sat in the car B: That's, that's bad . B: Uh-huh. A: and they didn't get beat up. You know. B: No. B: It , A: Rodney got beat up because he, he, you know, he you know, he involved himself in some sub, self-destructive behavior. B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, uh, just like the burning and looting is self-destruct. B: Uh-huh. A: Everybody says well this is the nineties B: Oh, yes. A: and they're going to rebuild A: and it'll be even better. A: Hey, what do you think, A: you know, some, some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area? B: That's right. A: With everybody with that mind set. They, they're they're going to, that whole area is going to be turned into residential ghetto, you know, B: They're only going to suffer. A: and you might even be able to, to use it for, for a bombing test site, you know. B: they're only going to suffer. B: They, they've defeated themselves with, with their looting and violence. B: Uh, I understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or, uh, don't live there or whatever, we all saw the same thing on the, on the tape B: and, uh, A: Well everybody is saying this is going to be a new era A: and we're going to reexamine this thing. A: Hey, the the average person is going to take a look at that and say, suspicions confirmed. A: They're a bunch of animals, you know. A: How can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything. A: Forty deaths. A: I mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that. B: I know. B: Yeah, B: it's really ridiculous. A: And I'm just trying to determine, you know, how you address, how you weigh, you know, Rodney getting, getting the hell beat out of him against, you know, forty deaths. B: Against forty other people being, A: Yeah. A: And there's no other, A: I'm not exactly sure, uh, what the circumstances surrounding the deaths. A: And I'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and, and pursued it, you know, because I'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing. B: Those deaths. B: Uh-huh. A: Is it a looter that got shot by a store owner? A: I, you know, A: no tears. B: Or just a an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what. A: Yeah. A: And and so I, but I, I suspect a number of them. B: Um. A: You know, you, you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot, you know, in, in the street. B: Or, or beaten. A: And, and my reaction is I would have run over fifty people before, rather than stop. A: And, uh, and there, there would have been just nothing but carnage after, after, after if I'd been at the wheel. B: Um very A: No one would have stopped me. B: Right. B: That's, that's exactly how I feel too. B: I wouldn't have, uh, they wouldn't have stopped my car for any, anything had I seen them coming. B: But I was just wondering since you're, you're in, you're back east, uh, and a little closer to the, the bigger cities than we are in Idaho here. A: Right. A: I'm inside the beltway. B: Oh. A: You know how capital gang, they always say well inside the beltway, they think thus A: and so and I say well wait a minute, A: I'm inside the beltway A: and I don't know. A: Yeah. A: But Payless Cashways has them A: and they're metal, A: and I don't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there, A: but it was only like seven dollars, not too bad. B: Oh. B: I'd have to check into something like that, because, I mean, we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here, you know, B: but, um you know, occasionally we have some around, A: Yeah. B: but, you know, for other kind of cans, just to, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they. A: Yeah, A: I don't, A: yeah, A: I don't think it would crush steel cans, A: it's pretty tough. B: Yeah, B: so. I don't know, B: I don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that, B: but, I need to look into it more, A: No, A: you could probably just, you know, B: you know, it's, you know, it, B: sometimes, even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper, you know, B: they won't take paper that's shiny, A: Yeah A: they won't, yeah, they won't take any lint free paper A: or, see, I work at T I. B: Yeah, B: so does my husband, B: yeah. A: We do a lot of recycling out there. B: Uh-huh. A: Now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard, A: but that's just now come on board. B: Uh-huh. A: You know, we've been throwing paper out there away for years, A: and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out, you know. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I don't know what, B: you know, I haven't, B: I'm sure they're probably doing that here some. A: Yeah, A: I'm sure they are. A: T I is doing it pretty well nation-wide, I'm sure. B: Uh-huh. B: I think it's necessary, B: I, I like it, B: you know, it makes, B: I think it's good that you see these, you know, like boxes, cereal, B: they're now starting to make them, you know, the packages out of recycled paper, B: and, And I've bought, you know, I've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper, A: Oh, yeah. B: and I think they're just fine. A: Yeah, A: I bought a, A: I got one at work that I bought for one of the guys there at work, A: it's his birthday, A: we're pretty good friends, A: and what it is is a recycled paper bag B: Uh-huh. A: and it's just got Happy Birthday printing on it, and a cute little phrase inside, A: and it's just a paper bag B: Uh-huh. A: you know, and it's really cute. B: Yeah. A: But, I think we're doing better and better all the time, B: Yeah A: still don't, B: I think we're getting, becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more. B: So. A: No, A: there's not going to be any room, shortly. B: No, B: no, B: the office, A: I don't know what New York does about theirs. A: I guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere. B: Yeah, B: it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere A: Yeah, A: so. But I think we're getting better at it B: Yeah. A: I think there's quite a bit more we could do. B: to someone in the Girls, put that away. B: Now. A: But, you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth. B: Yeah, B: I just wish it was a little more convenient to do, A: Yeah. B: you know, seems like you're so busy anyway, B: and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about. B: So. A: Yeah, A: it sure is. B: I think if, you know, the cities, locally, you know, they'd get more programs going so that you could do that, it'd make it a lot easier. B: So. A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: Well, they'll get at it sooner. A: I guess the schools will get into it, too, sooner or later. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: get the kids interested in it too. A: You know they have, A: We tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that I have, A: and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans. B: Yeah. A: You know, if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people, sure they'll save them for us, there's no problem there. B: Uh-huh. A: But what do you do with them in the meantime? B: That's right. A: Now I don't want a can, a garage full of cans B: That's right, B: who does. B: You know people don't have room for that kind of stuff. A: You know. A: No, A: they're just not, they're not prepared for it. B: No, B: and in Texas, they're just get, things like that, B: they just get bugs in them. B: So. A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: they do. B: So, you don't, A: You know, the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get, A: that's for sure. B: That's right, B: so. A: So. B: I'm pretty lazy about it right now. B: Everything goes into one thing and goes out to the A: Yeah. B: You know, pick it up. B: So. A: Yeah, A: myself. A: About the only thing I really recycle around here is aluminum cans. B: Uh-huh. A: So. B: Well, I need to get, get better at it. B: So. A: Well, if we all try a little bit, a little bit goes a long way. B: Yeah, B: that's right, B: that's right. A: If everybody tries to do just a little bit, and a little bit more then we'll get there. B: That's true. B: That's right. A: Well thank you for talking to me. B: Huh. B: Well, thank you for calling. B: I, A: Sure, A: no problem, B: Okay, B: take care. A: All right, B: Bye-bye. A: Bye-bye. A: I, I, I, assume you have kids in B: Uh, we have one. B: She's only nine months old. A: Oh, well she, she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet. B: Right. B: Well, my degree is in teaching, B: so. A: Yeah. A: Well, we have a little bit of a basis for conversation. A: I was a substitute teacher for about a year. B: Oh, really. A: Yeah. A: I, uh, thought I wanted to be a teacher A: so, but before I went through all of that I wanted to see how I was going to like it. B: Uh-huh. A: And, and they, uh, A: in Alabama, where I came from they, they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree. A: So I went out and played substitute for a while and decided, nope, not for me. B: Did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels B: or, A: Yeah. A: It was, A: I just took grades one through six. B: Uh-huh. A: I thought I was going to be smart and get the good kids, wrong. B: Well, my degree was in fourth through seventh grade B: but I taught junior high. B: And I expected it to be a lot of trouble B: but it wasn't that bad, B: I taught remedial reading kids. A: Um. B: And, well, they don't call it remedial reading these days, they call it something else. A: Yeah. B: But, but, anyway, at the time that's what I taught. B: And, um, you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way, when you have your slow readers A: Uh-huh and clicking noises in B: but it, it wasn't too bad. B: We, we got long real well. A: Well, I, I sometimes wonder if I didn't mess up. A: I maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can, if you have to you can get mean with them. A: Those little kids don't understand it. B: Yeah. B: I, B: especially with the real young ones. B: I started out wanting to teach lower, like primary and then top primary and thought, well, no, I don't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth B: and so that's what I got my certification in. A: Uh-huh. B: But I had decided long before I was even married that I wanted to, if possible, teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools. A: Yeah. B: Um, and my reason for that was I don't like the, uh, what's the right word. The varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools. A: Well, that's a nice way of putting it. B: You can find a lot of good public schools if you, if you look real hard B: but I don't think they could cover everything that you could teach, your children on an individual basis. A: exactly, A: And too, most people don't have that option. B: Yeah. A: You know. And plus it also depends on the district your in as, I mean, on the, A: I've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do. Uh, accept for the private ones, of course, we're talking about public. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. A: I don't know A: Back when I was going to school uh, you just didn't get away with the things these kids get away with now. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean you, you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and, uh, usually bending over to get five of the best, B: Yeah A: Um, but now, nowadays they can't even, they can barely scold the children for something, you know, without getting sued. B: And the, the, um, the crime is just escalated and the drugs and, even in the, in the the, the lower, the lower schools. A: Oh, yeah. A: Well, the thing that really did it for me, I was subbing in a fifth grade class A: and, uh, this kid comes to school with his lunch box A: and inside this lunch box he, he's got easily two, I'd say two hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills. B: Um. A: And I asked him, uh, what are you doing with that? A: And he says, "My father gave it to me." A: And I didn't believe it for a minute. B: Uh-huh A: Um, so, uh, but, uh, you know, the, A: not a lot I could do about it. B: Right. A: Can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants. B: Crazy for him to B: but, A: Well, I have, A: I, I, I've A: I think I understood what the, what the kid was doing he was a, uh, A: well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: But not a lot I could do about it. B: Well, we had the problem when I was in, B: with teaching, um, B: I was eighth and ninth graders that I worked with B: and if we did have a, a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there. A: Uh-huh. B: And you don't know if you were reaching them or not B: but we felt like, you know, maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was trying to teach them was better than have them taken out. A: Yeah. A: Because, uh, uh, that just, A: that doesn't do a lot for them. A: I mean it, alleviates your problem B: Yeah. A: but it doesn't do anything for them. B: Right. B: Uh, most the time if they were, they were, B: some of them were even better behaved. B: I've only had two instances where I it was really noticeable B: but they were better behaved when they were, um, B: I don't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on B: but it ended up better B: but, A: Uh, I don't know, A: guns and, A: I don't know A: it's something. B: I think there's a problem too with teachers trying to, um, to be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics, you know, B: they've been a big drive in, especially in the seventies to return back to the basics. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, and I'm not completely just, you know, just teach the basics in schools B: but I think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because, of our, our lower grades in the standardized test and such. A: Oh, yeah. A: Oh, sure. A: I mean, it's indicative across the board that we, we've done something wrong. B: Right. A: And when you see, uh, Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the, uh, science jobs, all the engineering jobs, all the mathematical jobs A: and, you know, here we are A: we can't, we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, I don't know. B: Well, I spent a year and a half in Japan also B: and I've seen how their school system works B: and I, B: they go by a complete rote system, B: you just memorize everything. A: Uh-huh. B: And then at the end of the, of a certain time period you spitted everything back out B: and the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be. A: Yeah. B: So I don't completely agree with that either. A: No. B: But there, there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere. A: Yeah. A: That's, that's a great deal what law school's like B: Oh, is it? A: Yeah. B: Is that what you ended up going into? A: Yeah. B: Oh. A: And, uh, I did the same sort of thing, A: they just, A: you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases A: and then you get one examine for the whole semester B: Uh-huh. A: and it's how well you can remember it all. B: How, how much can you stuff in your brain. A: Yeah. A: And I found that a particularly useless way of studying. B: Yeah. A: I never did. A: I always tried to understand things, not tried to memorize. B: Uh-huh. A: And consequently some of the very best students were, had excellent memories A: but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned. B: Yeah. A: So, B: Yeah. A: It didn't show me anything. A: A year and a half, I gave it up. A: I wasn't really A: I didn't want to be a lawyer anyway, just wanted the degree. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: So, B: Yeah. A: Well, B: Well, A: I don't know. A: What can we do about it? B: good question B: Probably, A: Money, Money is not the answer. B: Taking, B: No. B: There's plenty of money in the system, A: Yeah. B: it's just, A: Yeah. A: I mean, they're throwing more money at it now than ever before A: and things are getting worse. B: I think it's like a lot of things in the, in the United States. B: We've got so much built up in, um, in the, in the, uh, bureaucracy and in the politics of it, A: Uh-huh. B: and in the, the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again B: and there's no way that, that can be done. A: Uh-huh. B: Not without wiping out a whole generation of, of kids in the school system, A: Yeah. B: so. A: Yeah. B: Maybe on smaller, smaller scales. A: Well, I don't know A: I, uh, A: as much as I didn't like school when I was going through it, from my perspective now I can see that it's a lot better than what we have now. B: Uh-huh. A: And I think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school. B: Yeah. A: You know, I mean, it's, it's silly that these, that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline. B: Uh-huh. B: Right into the classroom it needs to be be able to be enforced. A: Yeah. A: Exactly, A: I mean, I, I mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something, to students because they're going get, they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something. B: Uh-huh. B: It's like doctors in lawsuits, A: Oh yeah. B: you know, they're kind of fearful of, everything. A: Well, lawyers help create that B: That's, that's, B: well, at least I've heard that B: I, I, I haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's, been applicable to me A: Well, I think, I think, I, I mean what we've turned the school schools into now are just day-care centers A: you know, somebody, A: okay, A: we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day A: and he's out of our hair. B: Right. A: And the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents. B: Uh-huh. A: You know, they're just, B: Oh, yeah B: it has to be reinforced in the home. A: Oh, sure. A: I, I A: you, you can, you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything at home then it's, it's not going to help either. B: Yeah. B: Right. A: So, I don't know, A: I don't know, A: I don't know what the answer is. B: Uh-huh. A: It's an interesting, interesting thing you want to do. A: I, A: how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools, A: do they allow it? B: Yeah. B: They allow it under certain circumstances. B: You have to, to prove that you're teaching them something. B: You have to follow, a preferred curriculum, A: Uh-huh. B: um, they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum, although you don't have to. A: Uh-huh. B: And then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be, they're kind of monitored. B: You know, they, they will allow you to, B: I can't think of any examples B: but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence. B: And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that. A: Uh-huh. B: I don't think they're were in this area B: but, um, they, they are monitored by the, um, by the State School Board. A: Um. B: So. A: That's interesting. A: I remembering reading a few cases about that when it, when some people first tried that and they got sued. Got taken to court by the school system. B: Uh-huh. A: I'm glad the parents won. A: I mean, it seems silly that, um, we started A: that's, that's the way you got your education in this country. B: Uh-huh. A: And then, um, A: I don't know. A: I grew up, uh, in the, the sixties, A: and at that time, uh, it was is a changing time for the whole music scene, I guess A: and I grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it I guess for several years after I graduated from college and, and thereafter A: but have since, uh, A: I grew up in a small town in, in southern Oklahoma A: I have kind of gone back to, uh, more of a county, uh, flavor in music. A: Um, I'm not quite sure why that is A: and it seems like almost a opposite, A: but I guess I got away from what I consider to be the pot, uh, sounding music. A: It didn't have what, you know, I guess what I was looking for at the time country tells more of a, a story. A: It kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up A: and I've, I've become I guess more of a country fan over the years. B: When you say that you grew up, uh, in the sixties I take it that was the, uh, teenage type years B: or, uh, A: Yeah, A: that was my teenage years. A: I was born in fifty A: and, and, uh, B: Okay, B: we, we're very similarly aged, B: so we probably have an interesting perspective on the music on the times, B: so I'm just a couple years older than you, A: Yeah. B: um, essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that I, for one reason or another I didn't pay much attention to music, B: but as I look back now I realize it was very formative for me, B: uh, my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel, whom I saw perform when I was in college B: and I became attached to that style of, uh, urban, urban country if there is such a thing, A: Yeah. B: I think with, in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend, uh, to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, uh, usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it. B: Uh, over time I became very interested in, in baroque classical B: and I think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that I found it, it very relaxing for me. B: My tastes now run I guess to a upbeat, uh, Simon, A: Yeah. B: it's something that interests me, uh, combined with, with the classical tastes I had mentioned. B: And my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds, early eighteen hundred music. B: I'm not a music, um, B: , I'm not particularly schooled in it. B: I know what I like to listen to as far as classical music. B: And I, I spent a good deal of time listening also to, uh, people from the late seventies, really, um, Neil Diamond, for instance. Um, people of, of that particular time, A: That's kind of the way I am. A: Uh-huh. B: I listen to some country and western B: but I'm not schooled in it B: and I, I've enjoyed the times when I have listened to it. B: I played a little bit of piano. B: I continue to do that. B: I want to do it B: and I never have the discipline to stay with it, B: but when I do play, uh, and begin to reacquire skills I inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a, for a new piano player. A: It is, it's got, uh, basically an easy, uh, rhythm and, and tone. B: Right. A: And it's, it's pretty, fairly well easily to uh, uh, something to fall into. A: I'm kind of the say way, A: I, I've gone through different periods of life, uh, in music from pop to classical. A: I guess one of the things was that influenced me was that I, I've worked in radio stations as a D J for all my college years trying to support my way through there, A: and A: was support, A: I was influenced by all different kinds of music A: but basically because that's where I worked. A: And I've developed a real love for, uh, classical music in, probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was, uh, heavy into classical type music. A: He said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music, uh, that they were using behind them because they used, especially Disney used a lot of classical music, uh, behind the cartoons A: and so consequently we wind up, wound up playing a lot of classical music there A: and I think that, uh, got deep seated into me. A: One of things I especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is, uh, are those that call on those classical, uh, roots, I guess, uh, Barry Manilow comes to mind for some reason there's, there's not a whole lot of his stuff that I'm real crazy about, A: but he does have some things. A: Chicago had some things, B: Right. A: uh, and I think even Electric Light Orchestra had some, some real, um, influences by classical music A: and I'm still, still, A: my favorite, A: in fact most of my C D are classical music. B: I find it very interesting that some television shows that I enjoy I particularly like the music. B: I don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation. B: Uh, a good example would be, uh, B: I have connections but, but not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations, A: Uh-huh. B: uh, and I found that I really like CHINA BEACH B: and I particularly like TOUR OF DUTY B: and both of them, I had as much fascination of the background music, I think going on as I did to the theme of the shows, A: Yeah. B: uh, and I, I've, uh, THIRTY SOMETHING I'm particularly interested, B: but it's the music, almost that I find myself listening to, uh, A: Yeah. A: I'm kind of thinking that's maybe, A: our generation was, uh, so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with, uh, things now with the music that's behinds them. B: That could well be. B: I, I, uh, spent my junior year, uh, and sophomore and junior year in, in college when I, B: a song by the, uh, uh, B: I think the title of it was just Downtown, A: Uh-huh. B: uh, and if you recall how it goes downtown, ta, da, da, da, A: Right. B: uh, all I have to do is hear that song and I get strongly evoked memories of, of difficult times in school being behind on work, A: Uh-huh. B: uh, and my family now knows if they come into my study and, uh, I happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe I'm trying to get a project done, uh, at school, uh, and I'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away, A: That's their signal. B: They can hear the unconscious music signal behind it, A: Yeah. B: that's right. A: When did you first take your, uh, first piano lesson? B: Uh, probably about first grade, A: Yeah. B: and I have, uh, returned about every four or five years to thinking that I would like to do something about it. B: I usually get to the point where I can play some of my favorite themes B: and then inevitably I am swept away by the, the pressure of other types of things, A: Yeah. B: uh, A: It is a time consumer. B: It is. B: In order to continue to, to grow and B: I, I always think that I'll be able to do it B: and then I inevitably discover that I have no innate music talent relative to composition and that I struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other people take for granted, in composition themes A: Yeah. B: and I, B: keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them. B: I have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved, A: Right. B: uh, but in a, in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude B: and I keep thinking, gee, I thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand B: but, but it doesn't for me. A: No, A: it's making that, that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it. A: I was never able to, to master all that. A: In fact my brother and sister both, they were, oh, thirteen, sixteen years older than I, they went through the, uh, parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing, A: and when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again, A: they sold the piano, A: and is the turns out I was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to, A: so I, B: Uh-huh. A: that's one of things I felt like I missed in life A: and I, I really, A: in fact, uh, one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin, that is played on, uh, piano. A: I just, you know, I can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if I ever have the time to do that, B: Oh, , A: maybe one of these days, I'll, A: you know, I'm kind of like you, maybe one of these days I'll get around to it, A: I'll do something with the piano, A: but probably not. B: So we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance, uh, A: Just never got a chance to come out. A: No. B: That's the most fascinating thing A: Well, it's a pleasure talking with you. B: And you, sir, A: Best, of luck in your graduate school. B: take care. B: Okay. B: Good-bye. A: Good-bye. A: Okay, A: do you want to go first? B: Well, I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic. A: Fitness and exercise. B: Oh, God B: No, B: why don't you go first. A: Okay, A: um, I like to do, uh, weight training and, and cycling. And just walking, uh, swimming. A: I used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall. A: And the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore, A: so I had to kind of change my life-style a little bit B: Well, let me ask a personal question, B: how old are you? A: Thirty-eight. B: Oh, well then you should B: see over thirty-five everything goes downhill flop . A: Well, the rest of me is in pretty good shape A: it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to. B: Oh, you're lucky then B: because I've battled arthritis all my life, A: Really? B: I mean even since I was like about two or three. A: Oh. B: Then they diagnosed it, B: and usually most people are just absolutely crippled, B: and, uh, I do water aerobics. Religiously do water aerobics, A: Oh, I bet that helps. A: Uh-huh. B: I used to do it about six times a week B: and now I'm down to about four B: but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in in there, B: uh, I tried weight training B: and I'm telling you, you just, I just can't lift the things. A: Yeah. B: And the shock on the system is, is just too much, B: so I have stuck to water aerobics basically, you know, the weightless thing and, trying to keep this shape that way A: Yeah. B: but, you know, it's hard to find. B: I mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what I'm finding is that if they do offer it, you get the crowd of women that are, B: I think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way, to get in shape, without having to spend anything A: That's right. A: That's right. B: or it's the geriatric crowd. A: That's right. B: So, I've considered even becoming licensed to teach it. A: Well, I mean, if, if you know what your routine is, you can do that by yourself, A: and you probably do. B: Yeah, B: but you have to have an indoor pool. A: This is true. B: So, to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without, you know, drawing a lot of looks, means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity B: you look very odd in the water, A: Well, that, B: that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training, B: and that does look very odd in the water. A: I can believe that. A: Have you tried the, uh, the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center? B: No, B: and you know, that's the only place I haven't tried B: and people have told me. B: Now that's the Texins facility? A: Yes. B: I have been told that thing is just lovely. A: It is. A: They keep it at eighty-one degrees year-round. B: Huh. B: do you use that facility a lot? A: Um, a fairly, a fairly good amount, uh, more on the weekends, A: uh, I try to beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings, I try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center. B: Huh. B: Do you know if they have child care there? A: Um, have you done your attitude survey for this year yet? A: You need to put that on there, seriously. B: They don't, B: I don't, I don't work at T I. A: Oh, you don't? B: No, B: I used to work at T I, A: Oh. B: as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position B: actually when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry B: and I used to fill out those attitude surveys, A: Yeah. B: and, uh, uh, me and the insurance adjusters are, are very familiar with each other B: and my husband still works there, A: Yeah. B: and, um, I get my attitude expressed through them, B: but I find it to be very B: sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot mentality to save a few bucks. A: This is true. B: Uh, and never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I B: and I came down here B: and, you know, they did an attitude survey like six weeks after I had been working here B: and I asked about, you know, day care for the shift workers, A: Yeah. B: and boy I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that, you know, A: Well, it's not, B: it was not applicable to me B: and I was kind of horrified. A: Now what year are we talking about? B: We're talking nineteen seventy-eight. A: Okay, A: uh, things have become much more enlightened since then. B: They couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages A: Yeah, A: you know, we still don't have a day care facility A: but people are more sympathetic to it. B: I understand, I understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care, A: Yes. A: Yes. B: and, uh, the reason I'm at home is when I had my kids, and I was scheduled to go back and I tell you how much in the dark ages it was. Um, I had been rated number one in the field B: and then I took, uh, B: when I became pregnant I also got meningitis, and then delivered the first baby three months early, A: Oh. A: My gosh. B: and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home, B: and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment. A: Could you hold the phone for one second, B: Sure. A: Thanks. A: Okay, A: I'm back. B: And then they used to, uh, B: and then I had a second one eighteen months later, B: they told me to put them back to back B: and, of course, to maintain B: and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one, because that's when I go into labor four and a half months A: Wow. B: and I don't even know it. A: Of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back. B: Oh, yeah, B: very easy, B: very easy B: and they, they put me on twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then to, to try to control the labor and see how far it was going, B: and after the baby was born, since it wasn't premature, then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor. B: I think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof, because it was a, uh, thirteen thousand dollar bill, A: Really. B: but after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work, A: Yeah. B: and that was when they had, B: God it would have been the eighty-five layoff, A: Yeah. B: and I'll tell you how they handled this B: and I was just outraged, B: I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been, uh, terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months later B: and they didn't have any coverage under my name B: and I went back B: and I said what the hell is going on here, you know. A: Yeah, A: really. B: And they told me that, uh, oh, well, you know, you know, your husband works here B: and he's got a good salary B: we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway, B: and, uh, you know, we've got people here that really, you know, need to be working B: and so that we had just, B: you know, it was, this way we didn't have to layoff an active person B: and we'd just let you go. B: And it took me about a year of arguing, B: I said, you know, I've got to put this in writing to me, and because until they put it in writing, I couldn't get my insurance benefits A: Yeah. B: and I couldn't get my, uh, termination benefits either. A: There you go. B: I was just pissed as hell that they could do that. A: I, I can believe that. B: But I, I guess things have gotten better, B: I've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things , A: Oh, yeah, A: flex time is great. B: I still don't think that, they after my experiences that they could, you know, get me to go back, ever again A: I, I can understand. A: I can understand. A: Well, it's been good talking with you. B: But let me ask you this, since you use Texans, B: how much is it a month? A: Oh, shoot it's only about ten bucks a month. B: Now that's for individual. A: Yeah, A: I mean, uh, to add dependents is, is you know, maybe another dollar or something A: it's no big deal. B: That's it? A: Yeah. B: Now if you, if you pay your monthly charge, do you then pay separately for classes your taking? A: Uh, you do for classes, for classes, A: but to, I mean to use any of the facilities is, is no extra charge. B: God, that's cheap. A: Yeah, A: it is. B: That's really cheap. B: Do you have to be an active T I employee to join Texans or, Or a A: Or, or a A: or a dependent of one. B: God, I am so dependent these days. A: Really. B: It's a sense B: Oh, seen that my, my co-dependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbor's fence. A: Wonderful. B: Yeah B: So my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment B: but boy, I think I'm going to go contact Texans. B: I really think I am, A: Yeah. B: I mean, that beats any offer I've heard in a long time. A: Oh, yeah, A: it's great. B: Huh. B: All righty. B: When you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell? A: Uh, well, it would depend on when you go A: it's not, it's not excessively crowded on the weekends. B: See I'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty A: Oh, I don't think that would be bad at all. A: If you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the, to the Dallas site. B: Oh, I'm actually right on the Plano line. A: Oh, well, then you could go either one, B: Yeah. A: the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern, has a lot more niceties, amenities A: and you'd probably like the pool there. B: Oh, God it sounds like I would. B: I might do that then. B: Okay, B: I learned something here. A: Well, good. A: I'm glad. B: You can go back to work now. A: Well, thank you. B: Thank you. A: You have a good day. B: Bye-bye. A: Bye-bye. A: Okay, A: um, I guess, um, this is probably really a good subject for me because I really like to do, uh, hand work. A: Uh, mostly I do needlepoint, I guess. B: Oh really. A: But, um, B: What kinds of things have you done? A: Um, well, I've made a lot of baby gifts B: Uh-huh. A: It seem like that's, A: like, especially lately there's been so many babies, that, uh, bibs and blankets, and things like that. Wall hangings, um, B: Do you ever keep any of your stuff? A: Isn't that funny. A: No B: I do crochet and a lot of, uh, things like that, B: and I have very little of my own stuff, B: and it's kind of embarrassing. B: People say let me see some of your work. B: Oh well, can you do it ? A: Yeah, A: isn't that funny. A: I guess I do have one thing. A: A friend of mine gave me a clock kit B: Ooh. A: and, I, I needlepointed the face, A: and I, uh, kept that because she gave me that. A: So, B: That, that would be definitely something you'd want to keep. A: Oh, yeah. A: And it's real neat. B: Was, was the whole face done or just the numbers, and, and, like minute marks? A: Um, basically, the whole, A: well, no, A: I guess the minute marks, A: but the minute marks are done, they're like hearts. B: Oh. A: And then the, A: at the numbers they, they're kind of outlined and stuff. A: It, it was quite bit of work, A: but, you know, it was a lot of fun, too. A: I really like doing stuff like that. A: So. B: I did some needlepoint years ago, B: and then I got into the Bargello. A: Oh, what's that? B: Well, it's an Italian, um, needlework, using, using the uh, B: I started to say the canvas, B: but the, uh, huh, B: what kind of cloth uses that. B: I, I've just gone blank. B: But it's used with yarn, B: and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth A: Huh. B: and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors. B: Like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever, B: and it was used quite often in the colonial times to, uh, uh, to upholster chairs, and so forth, as well as the crewel, um, embroidery work that was done on them. A: Wow, that's interesting. A: What did you, what kind of things did you do? B: What I did, when I was doing that was mostly pillows, you know, for sofas and so forth, B: and I can't find one that I've done. A: Oh. B: It's one of those things B: I I didn't give them away, B: but I didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves or, or what, A: Yeah, B: and it, B: I was so proud of them when I got them finished, B: but I have no idea where they are. A: What did you call that? B: Bargello. B: It's B, A, R, G, E, double L, O out the A: Huh. A: That's, A: I've never heard of that before. A: I've probably seen it, though, B: I suspect you, I suspect you have. A: I mean, when you described it. A: Yeah. A: I mean, when you described it, it sounded like something, you know, that would be around, I guess. A: But, I've never heard of it before, A: and it's really interesting. A: Um, I guess I've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past, A: but I've kind of gotten out of that. A: I use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows. B: Me, too. A: Really B: Yes B: That's interesting. A: Yeah, A: it is. B: How did you know to choose this subject, tonight. B: That's funny B: What, B: how did you, B: what kinds of decorations did you use with the B: how were you decorating the baskets? A: Oh, basically bows and lace uh, ribbons. B: Um. A: Um. I really wanted to do, A: you know, so many of them now have the ribbons where, I'm not sure how they do it, A: but the ribbons, they make them, they like. A: I don't know how to explain it. A: They make them hard, you know? B: Like fabric that's been stiffened. A: Yeah. B: Yes. A: I've never done that, A: and those are so neat. A: I mean, I would really like to do those B: I've seen some, B: and there, there, they, B: I suspect they're fairly simple, because the one lady I've seen, I know that does it, I've never asked her any questions, B: but she has three kids all under the age of like six. B: And, and they're all a handful. B: So it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly. A: Oh, definitely, A: yeah. B: When I do, um, crochet, it's usually the lacy Victorian type things like that, A: Oh. B: and I stiffen those with a, a glue mixture. B: It's like white glue, B: and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then, um, allowed to dry in those, those draping bows, I mean, those draping streamers. I don't know. A: Oh. B: I was just. B: There's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with, uh, uh, high humidity, in a room, A: Yeah. A: That's I think that's what my concern was, was it really sure, and how they would, how they would last. B: Do you know what my concern is? B: How will I dust this thing? A: You're right. B: That's terrible. A: No A: that's true. A: That's funny. B: So many of my crafts, B: well, right now I'm looking at a little quilted, uh, uh, hanging, B: it's, like, it's a flag, B: and I don't want to wash it, because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth, B: but it's such a dust collector to be out, and so forth. A: Yeah B: And most of my things are dust collectors B: Uh, and I hate to dust. A: I know. B: So first thing I think of is how easy would this, thing be to clean. A: That's funny A: No, A: I do some, A: I have really gotten out of it. A: I don't do it quite as much as I used to. Um, I guess because I, I went back to school, A: so I don't have as much time. B: Oh, you don't have time. A: No, A: and I have two children also B: You definitely don't have time. A: It keeps me very busy. A: But I really enjoy it when I do do it, when I get the chance, you know. A: It's really, A: it's so relaxing to just sit, A: and, but once I get started, I can't put it down. A: I just, B: I have a similar problem. B: I've got to have time B: or I don't even want to get into it in the first place. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: And so I end up lots of time not doing anything at all. A: I know, A: I started a project, it's been over a year ago that I swore I was going to finish for somebody for Christmas. B: You just didn't say which Christmas, right A: That's what I keep telling this person, A: well, I didn't tell you what year as if talking to other B: What was this project? A: Um, well, it's a, it's uh, cross stitch, A: and it's a picture, A: and it's a wildlife, A: it has deer and trees A: and, it's really beautiful, A: but it's going to be a lot of work, A: and you know, I've, I have worked on it quite a bit, but not as much as I'd like to. A: You know, it's just so hard. B: Now this is done in the needlepoint? A: Uh-huh. A: Well, I A: it's counted cross stitch, actually, is what I'm doing, A: and so it's really, since it's counted, you know, it's really a lot of work. B: Yes. B: Yes, B: I do know. A: Yeah. B: I have done a little bit of that, B: but I decided that that's something that demands my my, my total attention. A: Uh-huh. B: And so I've got to have total, almost total silence. B: I can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate. B: It sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece. A: Uh-huh. A: Yep. B: It is not, does not sound like an easy one to finish. A: No, A: it really isn't, A: and I tell you, really, I could just kick myself for even starting it, because I have a feeling I'm never going to get it done. A: I'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life B: Oh, I'm sure you'll get it done, B: but it just may not of the original, B: obviously not of the original time schedule. A: No, A: that's true. A: I, I just don't know when I'm ever, A: it just seems like there's just never enough time to pick it up and do it, A: you know, it's just really hard. A: But I really do A: like I said I really enjoy it when I do. A: It's just hard. B: Just hard finding the time that can be dedicated. A: Uh-huh. A: And there's, there's so many other things that, I, I have done, you know, in the meantime, like I said, so many baby gifts. A: I've made a lot of bibs, and wall hangings, A: and so, you know, those don't take much time at all. A: So it's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them. B: Do you, do you use patterns, I mean, like a book of patterns, B: or do you go out an buy a, a kit, like for a bib or something like that. A: No, A: I usually just buy a pattern book. A: I have several pattern books, A: and I just go with those. B: Okay. A: And then I buy the bibs separate. A: Usually I think it's a little bit cheaper in the long run, A: and then I just use whatever colors I want to. A: I don't usually use the colors they tell me to. B: Um. A: And it, it depends on what it is, you know. A: But some things, especially letters, if they suggest certain colors for letters, I just go with whatever I want to. B: That's what I would do, too. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: Or whatever I have. A: There's yeah, there's a few designs I guess I've done myself, but not very many. A: Real simple ones, you know, I do. A: I've made, I made a little, uh, little, uh, little thumb print and made it a bunny. B: Ooh. A: It was really easy. A: I mean, just, just did a thumb print. You know. B: What. With ink? A: Uh-huh. B: Oh, okay. A: And then, see I didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print, A: you know, that was just the ink, A: and then I made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth. A: That was so simple B: Oh, that sounds really neat. A: It didn't take anything at all. B: Did you do, did you use, like, uh, a stamp pad and ink. A: Uh-huh. A: And then I just, B: Ok B: so you, B: just like being finger printed ... A: Okay, A: so what kind of movies have you seen, lately, I guess? B: Um, a lot, B: well, the last movie I saw, but it wasn't my choice, was the NINJA TURTLE movie A: Obviously you have kids. B: That's right. B: Yeah, B: but my preference is the one we saw before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. A: I haven't seen that one yet. B: That's an excellent movie. A: Um, the last movie I saw was, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY. B: Oh, was that good. B: I heard, A: Uh, see, I'm not a big Julie Roberts fan. B: Oh, okay. A: But I was a lot, I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be. B: Well, that's good. A: It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: it was a pretty good movie. B: SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat. A: I, I'm ready to go. A: It just, A: it's, you know, hasn't worked out that way yet. B: Right. A: You know, it's, uh, it looks good, you know if you like thrillers, anyway. B: Yeah, B: it is. B: Right. B: And I do. A: In fact, people I've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards. A: So B: Really. B: Oh, I love them like that. A: Yeah. B: I'm not, B: I mean, I, I like all ranges of movies, B: but I like that where they run tense. A: Uh-huh. B: I really enjoy, B: they keep me guessing the whole time. B: It's really, it was really interesting. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, what other movies have you seen then lately? B: Oh. A: Other than the, A: I assume you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES. B: Yes, B: the new one, of course A: Is that any good, A: I mean, I'm sure I'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives, and she's got two boys that I took to see the first one. B: Oh drawn A: So I'm sure I'm going to see the next one here real soon. B: Amarillo. B: I didn't see the first one. B: My husband said it was, um, about the same lines. A: Oh, well, then it won't be too bad. B: So, yeah. A: You know, it wasn't impressive necessarily, A: but it was better than it could have been. B: Right, B: right. B: And I was impressed with the fact that, um, it wasn't that childish. A: Yeah. B: You know what I mean. B: It wasn't, B: my daughter's five, B: I mean she understood everything. B: She goes to almost all movies with us except, you know, R rated. B: And she really enjoyed it, B: but it was on a higher level, you know, where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did, B: and I liked that. A: Yeah, A: I think that's important if you're going, you know, if you're going, uh, kids are going to, uh, parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least you know, semi for them too. B: Right. B: That's right, B: that's right. A: Yeah. B: It's pretty good. B: But we take her to just about every movie, B: and, she, uh, she does really good. B: We've taken her from real young, B: and she does real good. B: Like I said, we don't take her to R A: Uh-huh. B: So, if and when we ever get a baby-sitter, like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, we go see it. A: I's about to say, you're not going to take her to that one, I'm sure. B: Oh, no, B: no. A: Do you take her, or do you go to a lot of comedy movies A: or to, B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: What was the last comedy you saw? B: of to Oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw? B: to regular Huh, huh, huh. Good question, B: good question. B: We don't get to go that often, B: but something on the tip of my tongue, B: and I can't think of which one it was. B: Uh. Gosh, I can't remember. A: The last, uh, A: in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw B: Uh-huh. A: I said that wrong, A: the last movie I saw in that, you know, my father's had a, had a, always had a V W bus every since, uh nine, about nineteen sixty or so. A: Oh, really A: Oh, really. B: Uh, uh, B: they, well, B: he, he used it, B: he often has to transport plants or, uh, things like that cause he's, he goes to orchid shows and, and, you know, fills the car with plants. And so on A: Yeah. B: or . A: Yeah. A: It's amazing what a minivan can do. A: We went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan. And pulled the, uh, the little trailer behind. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: The pop-up trailer? B: Uh-huh. A: And, uh, it's, A: so it's really amazing how much a minivan you know, what it can do. B: Yeah. B: And they're not that expensive. A: No, A: they're not. B: Yeah. A: They're probably . B: Mainly because everyone makes them, you know A: Yeah. B: You can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be. A: Yeah. A: And we, we do a lot of, uh, driving. A: We do a lot of traveling. By car. B: Uh-huh A: And so that's the only time that the, that the, uh, conversion van came in handy. A: But it really didn't cause our, our kids are still little. B: Uh-huh. A: So, uh, that was the only time we really needed it. A: Other than that, it got terrible mileage A: and. B: Yeah B: Yeah. B: Minivans do pretty well. You know, twenty, twenty, twenty-five miles per gallon or more. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: Some of them probably even do thirty. A: Yeah. B: The, uh, B: yeah. B: There, there's some other cars I'd like B: but I, I would never be willing to send quite that much money for, uh, like, uh, uh, B: I'll drool over them. B: Okay. B: Uh, mandatory service. Yeah. I don't think it's a good idea, uh, B: because we'd have to change the constitution to, to, uh, allow, uh, involuntary servitude, uh, in service to the government. B: And I'm not sure that we could, do that in such a way that we could avoid winding up a slave state. A: Uh-huh. B: It's, B: I like the, idea. A: And, A: In what way are you talking about. B: Well, I like the idea of volunteer, voluntary support. A: Right. B: I mean they might be able to, ah, say that anyone who does that, uh, gets certain benefits that would not be available to someone who didn't do it. B: But to use force, uh, really sets us a, a, essentially says that your body, there's a title to your body and that title belongs to the government. A: . B: And you are not a free American citizen. A: Yeah. A: Right. B: The idea itself of service is good B: and when someone is say, out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they're not committed to huge amounts of debt, that's the best time to be able to do work that doesn't pay very well. A: See, I, A: yeah. A: And I also thought that, uh, that would interfere with, with college work. B: Yeah. B: Unless it were tied directly. A: And they didn't, A: Yeah. B: You know, if someone were studying something, take something obscure. Somebody was studying economics, the State Department could offer to send them to the Soviet Union for two years to teach them how to run their country. A: Yeah. B: As an extreme example, right? B: But, in reality, I think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use to, for their own will B: and I just don't think it would work. A: When do they assume this is going to be proposed or mandatory? A: Or when, A: when, A: what, what year are they looking at? B: Well, they're not. B: It's been suggested. A: Uh-huh. B: And it's sort of a topic of debate. B: Every time it comes up it gets voted down. B: The people who are promilitary oppose because they don't want people to have the right to opt out of the military into something else. A: Yeah. B: And the people who are proconstitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the United States is actually under attack A: Yeah. A: Right. A: Right B: So, mostly, it's just kind of one of those things that goes away. A: Yeah. B: Ah! They've got a noisy line. A: I thought that was your line B: Yeah. B: Well, it's somewhere between here and there. A: Uh, what age group are, are they looking at? B: Uh, oh eighteen. B: The draft age. A: Eighteen. B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: that seems, A: normally that would interfere with college, I would think. B: Wait a, B: yeah. B: Let me see if I can get on a cleaner line. B: If it's my line, uh. A: I moved. A: Maybe that is, that's part of it. B: Yeah B: it is my line. B: I was on a radio phone. A: Oh. B: All right. B: That's better B: Yeah, B: now their, B: they, they figure that they can draft you at eighteen. B: They usually do draft you at nineteen. B: And that's the, age they're looking at. A: Oh. Um. B: And, of course, they're, this one the women would be equally grabbed B: and they're almost on the verge of saying that you, if you're going to draft men, you're going to have to draft women. B: And you're going to have to put them in front of the guns just the same. A: Right. B: So, uh, if you're near that age or you know somebody who is uh, you know, be aware of that. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah A: Well, that's kind of scary B: Yeah. A: I'm not near that age A: I'm way over it A: but I do have children to think about, you know. B: Oh, okay. B: Yep. B: And you don't want them sent off to the Middle East to help defend Bush from Saddam after Bush gets done arming him. A: That's kind of scary. A: Right. B: You know, we only find out about that a year after the fact. A: Yeah. B: So, it's another thing. B: When in doubt, don't trust the government at all B: It's really reached that point. A: Oh. A: Uh-huh. A: Huh. B: Hey, you're in Perot country. B: I'm really thinking that this guy might be good for us. A: I do too B: I've been, B: it seemed dangerous. B: I thought is the guy a closet fascist? B: And then I find out that he helped rid the United States of the gablers. A: He's, he's helped out in a lot of ways. A: Yeah, A: he's, he's from Dallas. A: Or he's in the Dallas area. B: Yeah. A: And, uh, he's very well known around here. A: So. B: Okay. B: Well, I'm in the computer biz too B: so I know he's well known in the industry. A: Uh-huh. B: They, uh, B: I, I have high hopes for him. B: And I think that you know, if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us, then I'm for him. A: Yeah. A: I, I. B: I mean in the Democratic primary, I'm going to vote for Brown just because I kind of like Brown and his attitude. B: But when, uh, when it really comes down in the fall, I think I know where it's going to go. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: I, I think he's got a very good chance. A: So, there's a lot of people here pulling for him. B: Uh-huh. A: So. I don't know B: Yeah A: We'll just see. A: How B: You know, A: did you, uh, you work in the, uh, computer business, is that what you said? B: Yeah. B: I'm an end user. B: I teach people how to use MacIntoshes and how to buy equipment and desktop publishing magazine production and things related to that. A: Oh, okay. A: Uh, my husband works for, uh, Texas Instruments. B: Uh-huh. A: And, so, uh, that's how we found out about the Switchboard. B: Oh, yeah. B: Oh, that's their project too, isn't it? B: I found about it on the network. A: Okay B: Okay Carol. B: So, air quality. A: Yeah. A: Is it, like water running and she is doing A: I know in here, uh, downtown Dallas, it's, you, I mean you drive by and you can just, you can see it. B: Uh-huh. A: But, then again I originally was from California A: and, uh, there is a big difference between Texas and California. A: And, uh they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner. B: Surely. A: And, of course, they don't have that here in Texas A: so, there's ... B: You mean they don't have the, uh, the smog alerts? A: No, A: not in, not in well not in Dallas, that is. B: Right. B: I, I, yeah, I spent a summer in Tyler so I know, just east of Dallas there. A: Yeah. A: We're going there tomorrow. B: Oh, really A: Uh-huh A: We're packing and getting ready to go to . B: Yeah. B: Actually, I'm a California born person. A: Uh-huh. B: I was born in L A B: so I know what you're talking about. B: In L A, it's pretty bad. A: Yeah. A: Oh, okay. A: Yeah, A: you do then. B: Uh, the worst city in the, in the world is actually, uh, Mexico City. A: Is it really? B: Yes. A: I would not imagine that. B: The worst one for smog is Mexico City. A: Huh. B: The most polluted city in the world A: Huh. A: You learn something every day. B: . B: Yeah. B: I know that they've, they're looking at, uh, uh, you know, uh, you know, better running automobiles. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: I've seen that. B: Uh, some things they do, one of them is they're using corn in fuel. A: Huh. B: You ever heard of that? A: Huh-uh. B: Yeah. B: Methanol? A: Huh. A: No B: Yeah. B: Well that's big up here because of the, they grow a lot of corn A: Oh, yeah A: Yeah. B: Uh, that's one thing that they do. B: At that, it's pretty easy to do. A: Uh-huh. B: And the, uh, B: unfortunately, it still contributes to global warming cause, you have to, you know, wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that. A: Yeah, A: that's true. B: It doesn't make sense. B: Uh, but it's, you know, B: one of the most, uh, productive crop in the world is corn. A: Right. A: Huh. A: And, of course, I doubt if there's any, A: you can buy regular anymore. A: You buy unleaded. A: Right? B: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Huh. B: Drive cars with catalytic converters, and all that. B: It's interesting. B: They're, they're looking at, B: there's some work being done on, uh, automobiles that are electrical powered A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically, B: but it has a, a engine in the back that charges it. A: Uh-huh. B: So the engine kicks on when the batteries need power B: and it turns off. A: Uh-huh. B: Interesting thing about gas is when, I mean, about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light, you're not using any any energy A: Huh A: That is good. B: Unlike a car where it's running. A: Yeah. B: A electric car it's on demand. B: I mean it's either on or off. A: Yeah. B: Basically. A: Huh. B: You don't have to shift B: So you, B: cars become very simple all of a sudden too. A: Oh. B: Very interesting. A: That would be nice. A: I think I saw that on T V one time. A: They, A: maybe it was C N N where they were demonstrating that. Or something similar to that. B: Yeah. B: There's, there's a race in Australia with solar powered cars. A: Huh. B: And Ford and General Motors and all those compete. A: But what, A: I think that was a, a, a setback. A: That they, A: I don't know, A: they went, I don't know, how many miles an hour. A: I think like B: Right. B: Yeah A: I don't know. Huh. * See note above B: G M, uh, Chrysler announced that they're going to, they're, B: well they actually have an electric minivan. B: Yeah. B: Their, their Caravan. B: But it costs, uh, fifty thousand dollars right now. A: Yeah, A: and they're, they're very expensive too. . B: To operate, yeah. B: But, you know, people are buying them. B: You know whose buying them? *"whose" = who's" B: The power company. B: Free, you know, free for them. A: Well, yeah. A: Yeah. B: Kind of interesting so see. A: Well, it doesn't make sense. A: Because if they want people to convert, you know. They should make it worthwhile. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah B: It's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour. B: So it's a good, good vehicle. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Um. Well I'll tell you. Sometimes it's, it's pretty bad here. A: Like today I think it was pretty bad. A: I don't know if it was, if it's just, uh, the allergies or what A: but some days it's very nice here downtown B: Uh-huh A: and other days it's just really bad, A: so, I don't know. A: So what, what kinds of things did you experience in L A when you were there? A: Or can you remember? A: Were you there at a? B: Oh, I wasn't there too long ago. Uh. A: Cause I haven't been there probably ... B: Well, you know, going over the hills, you know, coming into the valley? A: Yeah. B: You can see that horrible, horrible brown haze. A: Well, we were there when they had a A: Uh, do you have a pet Randy? B: Uh, yeah, B: currently we have a poodle. A: A poodle, miniature or, uh, full size? B: Yeah, B: uh, it's, uh miniature. A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah. A: I read somewhere that, the poodles is one of the, the most intelligent dogs, uh, around. B: Well, um, I wouldn't, uh, I definitely wouldn't dispute that, B: it, it's actually my wife's dog, uh, I, I became part owner six months ago when we got married, B: but, uh, it, uh, definitely responds to, uh, to authority B: and, I've had dogs in the past B: and, uh, it seems, it seems to, uh, respond real well, B: it, it B: she's, she's picked up a lot of things, uh, just, just by, uh, teaching by force, I guess is what I'd like to say. A: Oh, uh-huh. A: So, you, you've only known the dog, how long did you say. B: Well, about a year I guess. A: Oh, well, uh, is it, A: uh, uh, how old is the dog? B: It just turned two, I believe. A: Oh, it's still just a pup. B: Pretty much, B: yeah, B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: I have a, uh, well a mutt, myself. A: I call it a, uh, uh, Chowperd . B: Okay. A: It's, uh, part Chow and part Shepherd A: and it, A: as I understand it, uh, both sides of the, were thoroughbreds. A: So, she's a genuine Chowperd . B: Oh, that sounds interesting. A: She has the, the color and the black tongue of a Chow, A: but, uh, she has the the shape of the, uh, uh, Shepherd. B: Oh, that's, that's neat. B: How, about how big then? A: Oh, she weighs in at about fifty pounds, A: so she's a medium size. B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Most definitely. B: Yeah. A: and right from day one, she was teaching me. B: Oh, I wouldn't doubt it, B: yeah. A: She's the most intelligent dog I've ever seen. A: Course, I'm a little prejudiced, of course. B: Well that's understandable, B: yeah, B: it's, uh, A: You know, the first time I brought her home, she was only, uh, was it six weeks old. A: And I spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, next morning, she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom. B: Okay. A: So, on next night, I spread the newspaper in the bathroom A: and she used them there. B: Oh. A: But it wasn't too long until she, uh, found out she could wait until I let her out in the morning. B: Yeah. A: And since then, I, I live alone, B: Okay. A: and, uh, I live in motor home, A: by the way, I'm, uh, an R V, full time R V A: and it's, it's such a pleasure to come home at night A: and you can see her smiling from ear to ear, she's so happy to see me. B: Yeah, B: definitely. A: And, uh, I don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not. B: Yeah, B: I can honestly say we do, uh, we, uh, just recently put a security system in our house B: and so now, uh, in order to, uh, to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her, uh, uh, locked up in the, the master bedroom during the day B: and then she's got the, the bedroom and the bathroom to, for free run during the day B: but, we've always got, uh, got a nose and tongue pressed up against the window when we come walking up to the front door. A: Uh-huh. B: She's definitely ready to get out and run around. B: Really. A: Uh, she'd rather sleep outside on the, the cold ground at night. B: Oh wow. A: But, uh, I do make her come in. B: Yeah. A: And I feed her indoors, that's to lure her in, A: but during the day I have her on a, uh, on a leash, which is, uh, on sort of a run. B: Okay. A: I have a, a thirty foot cable, running from one stake to another, B: Okay. A: and then attached to that is a, uh, twelve foot leash, B: Okay. A: so she can cover quite an area. B: Most definitely. A: And, uh, she's the best, uh, burglar alarm going. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: yeah B: that's, uh, definite security involved in, uh, in a dog like that. A: Oh, yeah, A: she, uh, A: it's the strangest thing, though, uh, children, no matter how strange they are, or how new they might be can walk, uh, right up to her, B: Uh-huh. A: but adults, if they're strange to her, or, or they look suspicious or something, boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off. B: Wow. A: And I have not discovered yet where the, the line is between children and adults. B: Yeah, B: that's interesting. A: But, uh, she is a great comfort to me. B: Yeah, B: I know our dog has had, uh, some different reactions, B: she's never really been around children B: and, uh, if, if the child is, is pretty straight forward, um, she's fine. B: If, if a child is a little intimidated, she'll jump around and, and yip and bark quite a bit, B: and if the child gets scared, uh, she's still trying to play, but she doesn't completely understand what's going on B: and we've had a little confusion with, with, uh, with younger kids. A: Uh-huh. B: But, uh, you know, that's, B: it's a matter of exposure really. B: Um, we, uh, took her home to, uh, my family's place in South Dakota, B: and she was the one that was intimidated then. B: There was about seven kids ranging from about, uh, three years to ten years running around the house all at one time, you know come to visit Grandpa and Grandma A: Oh, uh-huh. B: and, the dog kind of, kind of felt out of place then because she was, she was being fed, and everything else from all directions. B: She really didn't know how to handle herself. A: You mean she didn't appreciate all that attention. B: She really did, B: she just, uh, B: she, she was she was just inundated with, with all the attention. B: Uh, she, she kind of, she kind of sat and it all in for a little while B: and then she'd go get back in and try to play and, and what not, B: but, uh, it was, it was just such a, such a new experience for her. B: She's only been around one and, and sometimes two people at the most B: so, uh. A: Uh-huh. A: What's her name by the way? B: Uh, pardon? A: What, what do you call the dog? B: Oh, it's, uh, Mitzi. A: Mitzi. B: Yeah. A: Mine is Gin. B: Oh, okay. A: As in, uh, martini. B: Yeah. A: Actually, it's Gin two. B: I, I see. A: Because, uh, when I was a teenager, in high school, I had Gin one, A: but then when I went out in the world, I couldn't take her with me. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: yeah, B: I had, uh, a similar, uh, experience. B: I, I grew up on a farm B: so I always had, uh, outdoor pets B: and, uh, the dog I had when I moved to Dallas about five years ago was a, uh, Springer Spaniel, black Lab cross. A: Uh-huh. B: And he was a real, a real lovable type, but, uh, definitely not an apartment type animal A: Oh yeah. B: so he, uh, he had to stay home. A: Oh, what a shame. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: it really was. B: He, uh, apparently had a tough time with it for a little while B: and then he, he got, he came to accept the fact that Mom and Dad were his company from then on, B: but, uh. A: Uh-huh, A: oh well. B: Yeah. A: Well Randy, we've just about used up our time here, B: Okay. A: and I must say it was interesting. B: Most definitely. A: I enjoyed talking about pets with you. B: Well that's great. A: Maybe we'll get together again in the future. B: That sounds real good. A: Take care now. B: You too. A: Bye. A: All right, A: Amy, how are you doing today? B: Fine, B: fine. A: All right, A: I think we know what we're going to speak about. B: Yeah. A: Uh, I tell you what, I'll start off. A: How's that? B: Okay, B: you go ahead. A: Um, I personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals, criminal cases that they should bring back hangings on weekends, in public places. B: Uh-huh. B: In public places. A: There is one state that does that, by the way. B: Really? B: What is that? A: I want to say Oklahoma, A: I saw something the other night about it. B: Um. A: They don't do them real often. Which is obviously the death penalty. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: Um, but I think if we quit, uh, building, these Taj Mahals with the color T V and sixty sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a, on a, on a life sentence, we should start hanging them and get it over with A: and let's just screwing up the system. B: Yeah. B: Well, the sentences are so unbelievable. B: I just saw on the news last night, that they said the average time a sentenced murderer, you know, is in jail is two years before he's paroled, and a rapists is like six months, and a burglar is like two months. A: That's pathetic. A: That's pathetic. B: Because they just say there's either no room in the system, you know, in the jails for them B: or, you know, it's just that, it seems like the automatic sentences, if, if a judge has leeway, on what he's going to, you know, sentence someone for between, you know, two months and fifty years and, you know, what's his whim to decide it should be two months. A: This is true, B: You know, it's crazy. A: an, and the way the law reads, uh, if they sentence you to life in prison, then he's available for parole. A: If it's life and a day, then he's not eligible for parole. B: Yeah. A: So, what, you know, A: let's quit B S with the system. B: Well even if it's life, like you say, we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some, you know, joker in there for life. B: We could spend that money, you know, for children that are starving, or twelve million other things would be more useful than that. A: Exactly. B: So to me if somebody has life, you know, beyond a reasonable doubt they should, that should be it. A: A life for a life. B: You know particularly for some of these really, I mean, B: there are so many just major, major serial murders, B: it's not just like one instance, or something, it's just, uh, horrifying, some of the murders that go on. A: The old Charles Manson case. A: I mean the guy is really, just shouldn't be allowed to, to even, even live. B: Yeah, B: an, B: yeah, B: there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that. B: Yeah. A: Uh, about the issue about sentencing by the judge. B: Uh-huh. A: The, the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene, uh, when there's a, my understanding, when there's uh, a verdict A: and it A: for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth, today, in eight to four A: and bam, bam the guy got off. A: Uh, he was, he was a veterinarian, and killed two, a father and a son, okay. B: Right, B: yeah, B: I heard about that on the news. A: Uh, it kind of gets back to the second request, A: we've been asked to look at, is most criminal cases requiring an unanimous verdict. A: In a situation like that, I'd say no, A: let's just go like a regular vote. A: Eight to four tells me that there were eight, A: there's a certain percentage of the people there, with sixty percent of the people, uh, seventy percent of the people said, hey, they guys guilty. B: Right. B: Rather than have to retrial the whole, whole thing and spend all the money for people to, uh, you know, go back to court and all the lawyers B: and, I mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a, you know, a fortune to keep doing that. A: Exactly. B: And the victims, you know, the family of these people that have been murdered, they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution. A: Exactly, A: because it's not next day they have, the, start the trial, it's X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more. B: Right, B: yeah, B: yeah. A: I think that, that if it's, if it's not a split decision, go with the highest number A: and let's just get on with the program. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: But as far as the sentencing by the judge, I would have to vote against that since there is a jury, because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision. B: Yeah, B: yeah, A: Uh, what are your feelings? B: Well if I, B: I saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge, I believe from Florida, B: and she just has, just really stiff penalties B: and I saw that in, in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really, you know, took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved, it could, you could have a, a judge that would really make a good impact. B: But likewise, you could have the flip side, and have some judge that was paid off or, you know, had a good old boy network B: or for whatever reasons, you know, politics, just let all kinds of people through B: so, he, he would have a heck, or she would have a heck of a lot of power, you know, if used wrongly. B: So at least the jury system does something to prevent that, you know, or help it with it anyway. B: I don't know if it prevents it, B: but, seems like the jury system does have it's advantages. B: But I also, I've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient, you know, B: and I don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers, at that point, they're really getting a select group. B: It's not just random people. A: Um. B: It almost should be the first twelve people that they, you know, have on a list are the ones that are on the jury B: and that's it. A: Yeah, A: I get back to Price's comment when he, uh, was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks, uh, you know, from his neck of the woods. A: Well give me a break, you know. B: He'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something, B: yeah. A: Exactly, A: yeah, A: yeah. A: I mean you're, you're in Dallas A: so everybody, A: I can't believe they can, A: uh, like in a murder situations, they look for juries who don't know anything about the system, well or know anything about the, the occurrence, A: you'd have to be pretty dense, B: Yeah. A: you'd be, you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on, or moving it to Lubbock, or somewhere, possibly is not the answer. B: Yeah. B: Oh, they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically. A: This is true, so true. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: Well this has been an interesting conversation. B: Well, really, this is, breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors, I mean, B: what can I say. A: So, you're at the house you're not at the plant. B: No, B: I'm at home with two little preschoolers. B: My husband works for T I. A: Oh, that's good, A: that's good. A: I thought I heard a holler there in the background, A: but I wasn't sure. B: Oh yeah, B: I've got the dog and two kids waiting here, B: I'm just locked up in the laundry room A: Oh goodness, A: well, I'll let you get, B: Okay, B: thanks a lot. B: Bye-bye. A: I enjoyed it. A: Bye. A: Okay, A: Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy? and background B: Well, as a matter of fact, I was thinking about that the other day, B: and, uh, I really don't know the answer, B: uh, I would sort of like to, uh, think about something in the way of, uh, uh, sort of a sporty car but not any, not, you know, a luxury type sporty one. A: Yeah. B: But, um, something that still has a lots of amenities and, you know, gadgets and things. A: Oh, you do want a lot of that stuff? B: Yeah, B: well, yeah B: I like, I like some of those things. B: They come in really handy sounds in A: What kind of, uh, things are you going to consider, A: you know, what, uh, you said something about the, about the, A: well, what do you call them, A: you said amenities, that they have, B: Amenities. A: but what about, um, their reputation of the company or the price. B: Yeah, B: well, of course, I guess, uh, price is always the big consideration, B: but, A: It is for me, A: other people, don't seem to have the same problem B: yeah. B: Well, that's, that's a big one in my book, A: Yeah. B: but, uh, um, I have preferences for, uh, for some, uh, makers over others, um, B: and I would sort of like to buy American, A: Yeah. B: but, you know, I'm not so totally hung up on that, that I wouldn't buy something else, B: how about you? A: Well, um, the last car we bought was American because of, because of that reason, A: but have not been entirely happy with, uh, several things about the car, A: it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as I expected it to be. B: Oh, really? A: Because several things, minor things sort of, A: but still they cost us money, um, that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay, on a car that, that was that new, you know, B: Uh-huh. A: we bought the car new A: and after, A: um, well, well, well under two years we had to replace the clutch. B: Oh. A: And, they just said, well, you know, clutches are disposable , A: and I said, since when? B: Yeah. A: Brake pads are disposable , you know, B: Yeah. A: we know that, A: but I never thought a clutch was disposable. B: Yeah, B: I wouldn't have thought so either. A: Yeah, A: so that was, that was kind of a shock B: Oh. B: Yeah, B: I, I guess there's a lot to, to think about when you're trying to make that decision. A: Yeah, A: you know, the less actually, the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars, A: they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like, like, uh, uh, a Mercedes Benz, A: they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable. B: Right. A: You would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes, especially not after two years. B: No B: but then, B: No, B: but on the other hand, I guess, too, uh, whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune. A: Really? A: Oh I don't know. B: Yeah, B: I've, uh, worked with a couple of people who have owned, uh, various years, uh, Mercedes A: Uh-huh. B: and, even though they do a lot of the work themself then just buying the parts and everything is, is pretty expensive. B: But for them it's, it's sort of a hobby, too, to own them . A: Yeah. A: What kind of, A: what brand of car are you thinking about buying A: or like what things are you looking at? B: Well, I haven't really gotten that far with it, um, B: I've always sort of liked General Motors, a little bit better than some of the others A: Uh-huh. B: but, uh, oh, I guess, I really don't know. A: How come A: I've been kind of, um, A: I guess the commercials are getting to me, the Toyota commercials, B: Yeah. A: and I know that a lot of people I've, I've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them, that hardly had any problems at all. B: Yeah, B: that, B: I think that's, A: I think they have a really good, uh, quality. B: Uh-huh. B: My, uh, daughter has owned two different ones, B: and, uh, you know, we've had some work done on them B: but it's not too bad, B: and the reason, B: one of the reasons we, um, bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years B: and he lived way out in the country B: so he put a lot of miles on it, A: Uh-huh. B: and, you knew it had, had been through a whole lot, A: Uh-huh. B: and yet, you know, it, it held up pretty doggone good, B: so, I thought they would A: Yeah. A: They seem to be really durable. B: Yeah. A: So, I don't know, A: I'm, I'm not ready to buy a new car yet, A: but I don't know, if, if the next time I'm going to try to, to stay with buying something American or if I'm going to go for a little more, what I would consider to be a long-term investment B: Yeah. B: Well, B: and I guess, you know, you always have to think about things like, your gas mileage and stuff like that, you know, B: you ... A: Oh, it's easy to get gas mileage in this car, B: Yeah A: it gets excellent gas mileage. B: Yeah, B: that's one of the big throwing cards for, some of the foreign ones like one music A: Uh-huh. B: Well, we talked long enough A: I think so. B: Okay, B: well, enjoyed it. A: All righty, A: thanks and background B: Bye-bye. A: Bye-bye. B: Okay, B: well, go ahead, B: I'll let you start. A: Uh, I was thinking about whether or not we should have people, uh, be required to do public service for a year or two. B: Uh-huh. A: And I was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family, A: or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to. A: I mean, you can't make it everybody. B: Right, B: yeah. A: But then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and, and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too. B: Uh-huh, B: or it could be like the draft where, you know, before they draft you, they uh, you get a physical anyway. B: So when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical B: and if there's nothing physically wrong with you, then you're drafted. B: It doesn't matter how rich you are. B: That would be good. A: And then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members, A: right. B: What did you say? A: Give physicals to the rest of the family members A: and they all had to pass. B: Oh, yeah. B: Uh. A: Uh, I thought it a good idea too, though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money. B: Uh-huh, B: that's true. A: And, uh, if they did this, maybe help them out in their college cost A: and maybe they could pay people for doing this, at least something, A: so they could subsist. B: Well that's true. B: America's paying all this money to have other people give, uh, aid to other countries, B: so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time. A: Yeah. B: Because, actually, when you, when you do, uh, service overseas you end up learning something, usually that's, that's really useful, plumbing, or farming, or, or something like that, B: so you're really learning a skill A: Yeah, A: and you know all these old people, they would get out of this right. A: All the ones that are already retired. A: So what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country. B: What did you say? B: Uh-huh. A: I'm just teasing B: Yeah, B: I, I, think, well that's probably the idea, B: I don't know whether the idea is to be within the country, or outside the country. A: Well I thought it would be a good idea if maybe you took some of the kids and had them go over to other countries A: and children from their countries came over to ours too, a trade off. B: Yeah, B: that would be neat, B: yeah B: sort of like an exchange program. A: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: And other than that, I can't think of any other ideas. B: Yeah, B: that'd be sort of neat. B: I like the idea of, uh, being, uh, a mandatory thing for welfare. B: Course that's what, um, B: that's sort of like what Truman had, B: or was it Roosevelt, B: I can't remember, um, B: with the big, A: Oh with W P A. B: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: Getting people, uh, B: the, the work program and all the, all the make work jobs. B: That was sort of public service in a way all the highways they started building. A: And we're still using those things too. B: What did you say? A: We're still using those things. B: Yeah, B: that's true a lot of them are still out there. B: Like all these wonderful highways in West Virginia and no one knows why. A: They built lodges before too, like at Caddo Lake. B: Lake what? A: Caddo Lake. B: Caddo Lake. A: It's between Texas and Louisiana, A: it crosses into both of them. B: No, B: I've never heard of it. A: Well, it's real pretty, A: it's like a swamp. B: Oh A: You know with all the Spanish moss on the trees, it's really, it's eerie. B: Oh okay, B: real pretty, like a swamp, B: oh yeah. A: Yeah. B: Oh, okay, B: yeah, B: I been, uh, B: I got, uh, talked to someone else before that was a, uh, a Texan, B: but I guess that's, uh, that's what we're going to have. B: This is, uh, a T I experiment to see how talk, B: Texans talk to other people. A: I don't know, A: where are you from? B: Uh, Virginia. A: Virginia, A: oh, that's neat, A: I talked to somebody from Ohio the other night. B: Oh yeah, B: it is neat to get other people. Especially since you got other, uh, ideas about how people, uh, how people react to things and stuff. Especially when it comes to, um, social services. B: Uh, uh, I'm glad they have a lot of, uh, um, you know, topics on social services, because, like this thing, this is a pretty good idea. B: I didn't even know if they were thinking about it. B: I wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone, somewhere is really thinking, that, uh, it would be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service. A: There is somebody A: and I, , uh, I can't remember who it is A: but there's a really famous, A: of dang, A: I can't remember. B: Politicians pushing it, or, uh or Mitch Snider. Or Mitch Snider. A: That proposed it, A: I read something in PEOPLE about it. A: Huh. A: Mitch Snider, I don't know who Mitch Snider is. B: Oh, okay, B: well see that's a D C thing. B: Mitch Snider is the, the advocate for the homeless that, uh, he, he's said it out here in Washington B: but he started the um, uh, the movement for creative nonviolence. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: he started that B: and that, that was basically a, you know, donate time and money to, uh, help the homeless, B: but, uh. uh, A: What have your other topics been? B: the other topic was, like I said, uh, something about politicians. B: I can't remember exactly what it was. B: It was real general statement A: I had one that I hated. A: It was what meal would you cook for, uh, uh special dinner B: Gee whiz B: yeah. A: How far can you go with that one, A: right. B: Yeah. A: Another one, though, that was good was, uh, what do you think about the social changes for the last ten, twenty and thirty years A: and what do you think has caused some of the social problems. B: Uh-huh, B: that would be neat. B: I'd have to basically say my birth. *humor A: That's probably the best one. A: And we had to talk about air pollution too. A: What do you think is causing it A: and what should we do about it? B: Uh-huh. B: Well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from other countries, I mean other parts of the state, you know, B: of course Pittsburgh, would say, you know, oh, find the better cheaper ways of burning coal, you know. A: Uh-huh, A: right. B: Cleaner ways of burning coal B: and people in the South would say don't burn coal, you know. A: Because we don't have much coal. B: Oh we have a lot of coal A: In Virginia. B: But, uh, it's, uh, it's a dirty fuel, that's for sure. A: Yeah, A: well how did you get into this program. B: Excuse me. How did I get into it, oh, B: I'm an electrical engineer here in Virginia. A: For T I. B: No. A: No. B: Uh, no, B: they, B: I'm in a telecommunications company B: and they, uh, sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers wanted to participate, you know. A: So does your company have something to do with T I. B: Um, not really, B: I mean no more than any other company, you know, B: we buy their parts just as much as anybody else. B: But, uh, no, no real association with T I other than being in the same industry, electronics industry. A: Huh, A: uh-huh. B: They just, uh, they just sent out a letter to everybody they do business with saying, that you know, if you're interested we're doing a study B: and, and since, A: And do you know how much, how long this is supposed to go on. B: I don't know, B: no B: I don't. A: I don't either. A: I mean it says just keep on until A: and they'll notify you. A: At first I was thinking it was just a week because that's all it shows, you know, on the schedule A: but then it seems like it might be longer than a week. B: Right. A: So what do you think we're going to get? B: What do you think, B: what. A: What do you think we're going to get for this? B: Get. A: Money, A: prizes. B: Oh, I don't know. A: Do you know anybody that's ever done this? B: Get your own, you're going to get you own T I seven thirty-two or something. A: I know T I gets prizes. B: Oh, I didn't hear about that. B: Probably for T I employees. A: I was led to believe that if you weren't T I that you get money. A: I'm not T I. B: Oh, your not, *typo your you're B: you don't work for Texas Instruments. A: Huh-uh. B: Oh, okay. A: Let's see, one of my friends had a roommate that worked for T I A: and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat, B: Oh. A: so she ran off copies of the thing. B: Oh. A: And I just signed up for it. B: Oh, oh, that's a neat idea. A: Yeah. B: Uh-huh, B: yeah, B: well he's gotten a good mix. B: I was saying because I've, B: like I said, I heard some other people talking that they've talked to different people in different states and stuff. A: Uh-huh. B: That's good, especially since you call that one eight hundred number B: so, so probably knock T I profits margin way down. A: And it shouldn't be too good right now anyway, because they've been laying off so many people. B: Yeah B: right, B: this is probably some government study program. A: Yeah A: really, A: so we're footing the bill on our taxes. B: Okay. B: Okay, B: well I enjoyed talking with you. A: Okay, A: well thanks a bunch, A: we'll talk to you later, A: bye. B: I'm going to save my two year old from the pile of grapes she's diving into. A: Well I'm going to try to clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around. B: Okay B: we'll I'll talk to you. A: Bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Okay. B: All right. B: Last thing I saw was, um, I think, uh, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY with Julia Roberts. A: Oh, I hadn't seen that, A: but I've heard that it's real good. B: My husband didn't like it that much. B: I thought it was okay. B: It was a little strange, you know, B: this woman supposedly is, um, being mentally abused by her husband, you know, B: he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house, B: and she figures out this way to, um, to leave him secretly. B: You know, she fakes her death kind of thing B: and he tracks her down A: Uh-huh. A: Oh B: So, the, the end scenes are, are kind of suspenseful, you know, when she realizes he's in the house, you know, after her, B: but, uh, kind of had the feeling along that, uh, B: why didn't she just tell him to straighten up. A: Yeah. B: You know, why didn't she just tell B: Hey look bucko, B: you don't get away with this nonsense A: Oh B: But anyhow, um, what have you seen? A: Well, last week, as a matter of fact, my children was on Spring Break B: Uh-huh. A: and we went to two movies. A: We went to see AWAKENINGS with Robin Williams. B: Um. B: Uh-huh. A: And we went to see KINDERGARTEN COP. B: Yeah. A: And I really liked both of them. A: I really did. A: AWAKENING was, it was kind of sad to me. A: It really was, A: and it would, it would be to anyone because, you know, they really don't know that much about it. B: Uh-huh. B: So this is where the people have been kind of B: I don't a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma, for a long time. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: And the drugs let them come back. A: Uh-huh. A: But the drugs didn't work for long, A: and they started having real bad side effects. B: Oh A: And this is about nineteen sixty-four, I believe, or something like that, A: and there still hasn't been any, you know, new development in prescribed drugs that can help it. B: Um. A: But, yeah, A: there, you know, A: it, it was a big breakthrough, A: but in time, you know, the, all the side effects started showing. B: Well, how bad were the side effects? A: Bad. B: Oh. A: Yeah, A: yeah. A: They was actually went back like they were, you know, B: Oh B: Um. A: yeah. A: All it was, A: they wasn't mild, you know, A: they was just bad side effects. B: Um. A: But I really enjoyed it, though. B: Um. A: You know. B: Well how about KINDERGARTEN COP? A: Oh, yeah A: That's strictly for entertainment A: That was just A: it was, B: You know, Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be, uh, a bit of a variety actor, you know. B: At first he was just a big muscle man. A: Yeah. B: But he's kind of branching out. A: He sure is. A: He is, A: as a matter of fact, um, Sylvester Stallone, is that his name? B: Uh-huh. A: I really believe Schwarzenegger is really going to be a variety player more so than he is, because he really played the part good. A: You know, he could be this rough, tough guy and then, you know, this substitute teacher. B: Um. A: It was really good. B: Well, there was a movie out, B: it's been on cable, B: I get cable, B: and there's this thing with, uh, Danny De Vito called TWINS. A: Oh, I've seen that. A: Yes. B: I thought that was just great. A: It is, it is, A: isn't it? A: Yes, A: yes. B: I even like some, I mean, some of the original stuff, B: like I like THE TERMINATOR. B: At first, you know, it was kind of strange, A: Yeah. B: but I still like watching him in THE TERMINATOR. And, and some of the other things. A: Uh-huh. B: Um, TOTAL RECALL last year I thought was really good, last summer. A: Oh, yeah. B: Guess it didn't last too long at the box office, A: Yeah. B: but I thought it was pretty good. A: I did too, A: I really did. B: And, A: I enjoy a lot of movies. A: Now as far as, let's say, heavy violence, I can't handle B: Um. A: I'm not into that, you know, A: I A: like RAMBO and all that. B: Um. A: I, A: that's just something I just don't want to watch. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: and I, I have some, B: one person at work I know gets really into those goofy horror flicks A: Oh. B: and I just keep telling her, how can you do that? B: And I told her when she had her, her little girl. B: I said, now you better get out of the habit of watching those. B: You shouldn't be watching them with your little girl, B: and she says her little girl's into it now. A: Oh, my goodness. B: And she she watches these really gross things you know, like, THE NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and, The, you know, that kind of, junk. A: Yeah. A: Oh, uh-huh. A: Yeah, A: uh-huh. A: Oh. B: I don't go for that at all. A: I guess I'm a little too scary for that. B: I remember when I was real little, I, we all went to some kind of scary movie, B: and it was like this big house had a basement, B: and there was all these weird things going on in the basement, you know, B: and I was scared to death of our house had a basement for years. A: Oh, uh-huh. B: You know, B: and I got a lot of really weird ideas, from that goofy movie. A: Yes, A: yes. A: Yes. B: You know, they tell you that kids can, you know, be impressed by all that stuff, B: and it's true. A: It is, A: it really is, A: yes. B: I, I had a lot of things that I, I, B: nobody told me that it was all fake. B: I was just sitting there watching it, going a scared Oh, jeez A: yeah. A: Watching, A: yes, if a scared A: oh, I don't want to go home, A: yes, A: yes A: Oh, goodness. B: But I think a lot of kids, it's funny, get the same kind of fears, like there's somebody under the bed. A: Yes. A: Oh. B: Where do we get that from? A: Yes, A: I know, uh, A: I have two children. A: I really try to watch what they watch, A: I really do, because my youngest one, he watches something, you might as well just plan on staying up all night, because you know He'll come in, A: Mama, I think the ghost is in the house, A: Mama, I hear it, A: don't you? A: They're eight and ten. A: So they're, you know, A: it's just a movie, you know, A: I try to say, it's just a movie, A: but no, A: Mama, I've seen it B: Oh, B: but I remember, I was with a friend of mine, had, uh, three kids, B: and the little boy must have been, oh, maybe about ten. B: And we rented CHARLOTTE'S WEB. B: Okay. A: Oh, uh-huh. B: And he just bawled at the end and just a crying uh, she's not going to die. A: Oh, A: Oh. B: And we were trying to say, Kenny, it's okay, B: and he didn't want to listen to it. A: Oh. B: He just was beside himself, you know, B: this is supposed to be a nice children's movie, CHARLOTTE'S WEB. B: He just couldn't stand it that Charlotte was going to die at the end. A: Die, A: oh A: Oh A: It's funny how your little minds work, A: isn't it? B: Oh, yeah B: a crying She's so nice, B: she can't die A: Oh B: Oh, it was A: Oh, I guess that's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars, A: people like us, you know B: Oh, A: Oh, goodness. A: Well, well I've enjoyed talking to you. B: You too. A: And maybe we'll run across each other again. B: Yeah, B: this is kind of neat. B: I haven't ever initiated a call. B: I've just been called, you know, by the switchboard, B: and, uh, well, the first week, I think, a lot more people were doing it. B: But I normally get a call like every other day. A: Do you? A: I have heard that's real good. A: And I, uh, B: That's, Burt Reynolds, isn't it? A: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I've heard that. A: And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny. B: Now someone told me that B: and also, uh, I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN, because they said that that was really good this season. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, his favorite night is Monday night A: so we've got to where we will sit, and watch it on Monday night, B: You've got to yeah, B: Uh-huh. A: because that and then that, uh, oh, A: I can't even think of the name of it. A: Like I say I'm not, B: DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night, too. A: Yeah, A: and the one with the, the sergeant that married the woman with the kids, Sergeant McGillis . B: Huh, I don't even know. A: Sergeant, uh, MAJOR DAD. B: Oh, okay. B: Now I, we've never even seen that. A: Yeah, A: that comes on right after, uh, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN, and DESIGNING WOMEN. B: Uh-huh. A: So we always, he watches that A: and I kind of I watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others, as I can. B: On the others. B: Well, you know, on Friday nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY. A: Uh-huh. B: Or, um, A: Uh-huh. B: It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS LANDING. A: Yeah. B: But, uh, we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot. B: Oh, excuse me just a minute to someone in the B: The money is right there on the thing and the coupon. A: Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around though. B: Oh, I know. B: That's the thing. B: And so, we, A: Except they, probably are in bed, by nine. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, they are. B: In fact, on weeknights they are in bed by eight, B: but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off. A: Did you get your pizza taken care of? B: Yeah, B: he has gone to get it. B: Thank you B: Um, but I was to say on Saturdays there is absolutely nothing B: and that's the day my husband, wants to . A: Well, do you know, A: I have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that I've really liked A: and that's SISTERS. A: Have you watched that? B: No, B: but I saw that advertised today B: and it sounds like it's not fluff. B: It sounds like it's good. A: It's really, you know, it's really pretty good. B: Uh-huh. A: I mean, it's kind of like, you know, um, soap opera I guess. B: Yeah, B: that's what they said it was kind of, a little more drama to it. A: But it's a, A: So far it, I've watched it about three times now A: and it's really held my attention. A: It's been pretty good. Some, pretty good acting. B: Well, and and another one now that it's getting darker B: and you are wanting to cocoon more, B: that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE. B: Some of these, that are nostalgic. A: Now I watched, BROOKLYN BRIDGE this week for the first time, B: Did you, like it? A: but I haven't, A: I did. A: I liked it. B: Did you? B: Well, they said that one and I'LL FLY AWAY are really quality, you know B: and, A: Now I haven't seen I'LL FLY AWAY yet. B: I haven't seen it either. B: I think what I need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then I get my bath it's, you know, it's almost too late to start, something new. A: Uh-huh. A: It's nearly, too late for T V. B: Yeah. A: That's the way I am. A: I get in, from work B: Yeah. A: and I'm tired A: and I sit and watch for a few minutes A: so I have to get up and do dinner, and everything. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights. A: Uh-huh. B: So, it's like, we are kind of, tuned out of our T V. A: Yeah. A: That's us. A: If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos, A: so. B: Yeah, B: well, we do too. A: But there are some good shows on. A: I, I really probably should watch more of them than I do. B: Yeah. A: But I like, A: I don't know A: I, I'm always in to making things A: and, And I don't just spend all my time, B: I don't know, B: yeah. B: There's a lot more to do with, with your time when you get into it. A: and I, my husband, now he sits and watches T V constantly. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, my, my sister and them and her husband do on weekends. B: They don't have children yet, B: and they just turn it on when they walk in, B: they turn it off when they leave. A: Uh-huh, A: uh-huh. B: So they are used to that too. A: I could be around here for hours by myself and never have it on. B: Yeah, B: I understand. B: Same here. A: But, uh, but there are some really good new shows that I have enjoyed, A: and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week. B: Yeah, B: it's real good. B: And then of course, in the afternoons if I get in from work in time I watch OPRAH, some of those, you know, talk shows. A: Yeah. B: I like her. A: I never get in in time for any of those. B: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: Well, it's, it's nice talking to you. B: I guess we've kind of exhausted this one, B: but it's nice talking with you. A: Well, it's nice talking with you. B: Thank you. A: Bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Uh, I guess it's, uh, A: watching the the T V today there had a lot of stuff on, on, uh, crime. A: In our state right now, uh, recently they've had a lot of, uh, uh, the rapists, uh, murder type, uh, killers going around A: and well, I, I, B: Oh, gracious. A: they've caught them A: and they, they're in there. B: Uh-huh. B: Wasn't it your state that had the, uh, guy that committed all those murders? B: There was that, uh, A: Well, yeah, A: Wisconsin, uh, and Milwaukee area, you know. B: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: that was really on the national news a lot. B: We heard a lot about that in Texas. A: Yeah. A: So that's, A: well, I, I live right on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin A: so I kind of get both, both news A: and, I know, in Minnesota, uh, they had, uh, the one that just, uh, got out and went after a, uh, college student and raped, and killed her B: Oh. A: and they are not too happy about that now, I guess, A: so. B: Well, I can imagine. A: There . B: It seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me. B: I, I don't know. B: I don't know if statistically they are B: but it seems like you sure hear a, maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news B: I don't know. A: Yeah, A: uh, that's hard to say for sure. A: I, uh, sometimes I wonder if these people aren't don't it just for the publicity A: and, They, they get their names in the, in the paper B: You wonder about that sometimes. A: and they become big celebrities. A: But, B: Uh-huh. B: That's kind of scary. B: I, I wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories. B: Maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas. A: Well, uh, I know one I, I think Texas has the death penalty, right? B: Yes, B: we do. A: Yeah. B: Do you have it up there? A: No, A: no. B: I see. A: See I, I B: Do you think that's a deterrent? A: Yeah, A: well, it's, it's, it's not going to prevent any people from doing it A: but, the person that's caught, he'll never do it again if he gets the death penalty. B: Yeah. A: And that's, A: and there are a lot of repeaters. Uh, B: Uh-huh. B: I guess that's another thing that to me is a, a real problem, B: and I know we have got so many people in our prison system now, at least here in Texas A: Yeah. B: I mean, they are really in a crisis. B: There has been times they have had to just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them. A: Yeah. B: And a lot of them they put out on parole B: and then some of the ones that they put out early, you know, do repeat offenses B: and, the crime rate is the worst than ever before. A: Huh. A: Yeah. A: Well, some, I'm just wondering a lot of times they will put, uh, people, lesser crimes in, uh, with, uh, people that did more severe crimes A: than they, maybe they just tend to learn from these people A: and they, and when they get back out, they just go into worse crimes. B: I think that could be true too. A: Maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more. Uh, B: I think the whole parole thing, you know, if somebody is convicted of second-degree murder or something gets fifteen years, well, they are out in six or seven. You know, outbound on the streets again A: Yeah. B: And to me that's really scary. B: Some of these crimes that they commit, you know, seems like the punishment is not really equal to the crime. A: Uh-huh. A: Well, uh, I don't know with, with my limited, uh, psychology background I do have, I don't, I don't even feel that prisons and stuff are, are the answer. A: If you want to stop the crime, I think you've got to get, uh, the people when they are kids. B: Oh, yeah. A: A lot of this probably just starts with, from the, from the homes. Also from the, the, the media, the T V the, uh, B: Uh-huh. A: all these, uh, gory movies on there becomes, uh, just a natural fact of life. B: Uh-huh. B: They think it's okay thing to do. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I think that's a very good point. B: You know, I, B: there's a lot more working mothers, a lot more kids in day care centers all that kind of thing. B: Morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore. B: And, A: Uh-huh. A: Well, a lot of the European countries, uh, they tend to sensor, A: well, they probably won't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent. B: Uh-huh. A: And they have a lot less crime. B: Huh. A: Some of, some of those European countries are, are, you can leave your, your, uh, doors open and, and, and be safe. A: Uh, even, uh, I think New Zealand is one of, one of the places, uh, that, B: Well, Sid, B: have you established what kind of requirements you are looking for, for your next vehicle? A: Well, I don't know if I really have a, a lot of, uh, requirements. A: Uh, I guess I look at, uh, getting the best deal. A: Uh, that's my main objectives normally. Whoever is willing to deal and, and give me a good price. B: Okay. B: Well, I, I tend to be more methodical I guess. B: Uh, I determine first of all what I'm going to use the vehicle for, whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a, a personal mover. Uh, where it's going to be driven, you know, what types of, uh, driving I'm going to be doing on it, primarily highway or, or local mileage more often. B: And, uh, hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that I tend to drive cars for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles. A: Uh-huh. B: So I'm, I'm real picky. B: if you are going to keep something that long, you know, you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that you are going to like for a long time. A: Yeah. A: I don't know I've had pretty good luck, you know, A: even if, if you take any car and, and you care for it well enough, uh, you are going to get some good life out of it. A: Uh, my, my Oldsmobile right now that I have, uh, is getting near eighty thousand A: and it's still in pretty good shape. A: Uh, there was a flaw in there where a, where a head gasket bolt broke, A: and it cost me some bucks to, to fix that A: but that was, you know, something that was unforeseen. A: But I still think I I'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it. B: Sure. B: Well, it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways also then. A: Well, I, I drive like the song says, THE LITTLE OLD LADY but, uh, but not FROM PASADENA A: But, uh, A: yeah, A: I, I baby them as much as I possibly can. A: Uh, it's a pretty big expense nowadays. A: Uh, and I guess I like to take care of it, uh, A: so I don't have to buy one too often. B: That's true. B: Uh, do you have more than, than one vehicle in your fleet? B: Uh, do you have a family fleet B: or, A: Yeah, A: I, I, I got an old, uh, seventy-six, uh, Grand Fury that, uh, doesn't want to die on me A: so I, I just keep running the thing. Don't want to sell it or get rid of it until it quits, A: but it just doesn't seem to want to. A: I'll probably have, uh, three, four hundred thousand before it wants to die. B: Well, that may be. B: They, Chrysler made some really good old engines back then B: like the, the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine. A: Oh. I've got the big three sixty in there, gas guzzler A: but it runs good. B: Yeah. B: At the moment I've got, uh, Cadillac Cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a, uh, reasonably new Plymouth Voyager. B: It's only a, a couple of years old. B: But that's the second one of, of those that we've had, B: and that's the, the family travel vehicle. B: You know, not only does it do all the, the, uh, carpooling around during the week, B: but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in. B: I think that what I'm getting ready to get next is probably a Suburban unless they drastically change the, the vehicle a lot. B: Uh, I'm just getting tired of when I do get hung up in traffic, not being able to determine what the problem is and, and come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit and that kind of stuff. Just because I can't see, you know, A: Yeah. B: I'm to, my Cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that I can't see past any vehicle that's in front of me. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Well, I'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle. A: Uh, I just have so many hauling projects a lot of times A: and, uh, I, I'd like to just start doing some, uh, carpentry, uh, type work around. A: I just feel that, A: So, so what have you seen lately that, um, you think is worthwhile? B: Um, the last movie I saw was REGARDING HENRY. B: Have you seen that yet? A: No, A: I, I saw the previews. B: It's really good. B: I loved it. B: Um, it's, um. A: Does, does he, does it have a happy ending, A: or. B: Yeah, B: really good ending A: Uh-huh. B: um, uh, it was the, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. B: I generally don't get into movies that much, B: but I saw that one, B: and then before that one, I saw, um, oh, NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF. A: Oh, that was funny, wasn't it B: Yeah, B: did you, have you seen that one? A: Yes, A: and, and, and, and the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and, you know. B: Yeah, B: it's exactly like AIRPLANE wasn't it A: Yes. B: But it was silly. A: Right. A: So, now these are for two very different movies. A: One, one, uh, absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly, you know, serious subject. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: I, I guess I have similarly broad tastes. A: Um, my most recent, um, movie that I, that I liked a lot, not my most recent movie, was HENRY THE FIFTH. A: I only rented it, you know, maybe a month ago B: Uh-huh. A: and it's been out for a couple of years, A: but. Have you seen that? B: I haven't seen that yet. A: Well, it's, it's a, it's an adaptation of the, of the Shakespeare play, A: and it's beautifully done. A: Um, I believe that all the language is as Shakespeare wrote it, except it's been shortened a little bit A: and there might be a word or two changed. B: Right. A: Uh, but it's, it's, it's a glorious movie B: Um. Such as A: um, and I like, as you know, these, these, these silly movies, A: and I also like just some strange movies. A: Do you have any. A: Well, the, the one that comes immediately to mind, I, um, is the THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, HER LOVER. A: Um, but there are also these various, um, David Lynch movies. B: Uh-huh. A: Um, I got, I got hooked on TWIN PEAKS. A: That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on. B: Oh, really. B: I haven't seen any of those. A: Oh. A: Um well, I don't, I don't especially recommend, B: They're really good? A: I mean, you have, you have to just sort of like this thing, A: you have to like, A: did you see TWIN PEAKS? B: Huh-uh, B: no. A: No, A: so, okay. A: So, if you weren't, if you weren't drawn to watch that, you, maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies, either. B: Uh-huh. A: They're, they're just strange. B: Are they, I mean, is it, like mystery, or suspense A: Well, uh. I think suspense is the right word. B: or, A: Uh, and, but, but, a little bit strange and esoteric A: and, uh, in the case of TWIN PEAK a little, there's some elements of the supernatural in it, too. B: Oh really. A: That was the television show. B: Um. A: Um, there's also a, a a producer of movies in Baltimore called, um, John Walters, who, who puts, puts on even weirder movies. A: Uh, his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream, like HAIR SPRAY. A: Um, but back in his early days, he, he, he had things, um, um, A: what, what are the titles, A: I can't remember the titles any more. But, some really weird ones, uh, with quite a random crew of, of characters. A: Um, it would have made, you know, these Fellini movies look normal. B: Right. B: So do you like, um, movies a lot? B: See I don't do, B: I don't. A: I do, I do like movies a lot. B: Right. B: See, I don't do that, B: I don't go to movies that often, B: but, just recently I've been to a couple A: Do, do you rent them, A: or. B: Um, no, B: we, I just go to like the dollar movie theater around here generally, A: Yes. B: but, I don't know, B: I just, I usually fall asleep B: or I get bored pretty easily B: so. A: Yeah, A: that's what my wife does too, um, A: I mean, she falls asleep B: Uh-huh. A: So we have to, we have to pick just the right kind of movie to, to, to, to appeal. B: Yeah. B: Right, B: that's exactly right. A: Well, well it was good talking to you. B: Yeah, B: it's good to talk to you, too. A: Take care. B: Uh-huh. A: Okay, A: bye. B: Bye-bye. A: Okay, A: did they tell you our topic? B: Uh, no, B: somebody else answered the phone and put my number in. A: Okay, A: it's, uh, B: Uh, what is the topic? A: The topic is cars. A: What kind of car will you buy next A: and what kind of decision you'd, do you think about getting, you know, pick that car out and, uh, and why. B: Okay. B: Uh, my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac. A: Okay. B: I've had, uh, B: well, I'm on my third one. B: And I'm not real sure that I'd be in the market for a car for quite a while. A: Yeah, A: I'm the same way. A: I was, uh, I had two Cadillacs. A: I went to my first Lincoln this last time. A: I travel A: and, uh, my grandfather worked for Ford Motor Company A: so he always said why don't you drive a Ford, or why don't you try a Lincoln B: Uh-huh. A: so I finally tried one after fifty years B: My, A: and, uh, I've had, I guess, I guess four Cadillacs and, and one Suburban in my last five cars, A: but I bought a Lincoln A: and I like it. B: My dad has been a, a, uh, Lincoln man for a lot of years, B: but I've always been a G M man. B: I'm in the auto parts business myself. A: Oh, are you? B: And, uh, the last Cadillac I bought was an Allante. A: Uh-huh. B: And I just love it to death. B: I'm not sure I'd ever get rid of it. A: Well, I'm a, I'm a traveling salesman. A: I travel on the road A: so I like a little heavier car A: but, B: I used to do that quite a bit myself. A: So that's why I choose, you know, to drive a heavier car and more luxury car. B: Yeah. A: But, I tell you what, A: I will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly. B: Really? A: Yeah, A: because I like the Lincoln A: but, there's just something about that Cadillac that, whether it's a G M C product or whatever. Seems they handle better. B: They seem to put, They seem to be put together a little bit better. A: I think so, too. B: And, you know, the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products B: and I think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from, uh, imports is they put so much, you know, gadgetry on the dash B: and, and the, the buttons are so small to push A: Yeah, A: they really do. B: and G M doesn't seem to do that. B: I kind of like that feature, B: so. A: You know, I'm a funny duck A: that came, it comes to the simple things like front end alignments B: Uh-huh. A: I have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac. A: I don't know why, why whether I just seem to drive them better or what, B: Uh-huh. A: but, I've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac. A: They always appear to hold well. B: I've, uh, I had an Eldorado, was my first one, was an eighty A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, I think at about sixty thousand miles I finally had it lined up. A: Did you. B: And I had them do all four wheels. A: And the only thing I miss about a Cadillac is, A: a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car A: and I traded it in, traded it in on my Lincoln A: and they're just not as large as before. A: I do miss that. B: That's true, B: yeah. B: But, what is big today. A: Well, you're right. B: You know. Lincoln is still as big as it always has been B: but, A: Yeah, A: it's big, A: but the trunk space for me, uh, A: what I usually do is I usually take the back seat out of my car A: and that's where I put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough. B: You know a car I ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental. A: Yeah, A: now, I have the Town Car A: and it's, it's a deep trunk, but not as broad as the, uh, the Cadillac. B: Well, the Town Car, I noticed, uh, B: or with the, with the Continental, uh, I was, rented one, one time uh, we could, uh, put golf clubs in them. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, good. B: You know, straight across. B: I mean, A: They went all the way down? B: Front to back. A: Well, that's good. B: Not going from side to side. A: That's good. B: And we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage. A: Yeah, A: I sell sporting goods, uh, hunting related items, A: I sell guns, gun cases and things like that B: I see. B: Yeah. A: and I need to, you know, A: that's about the same size as a golf club. B: Uh-huh. A: They need to, samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that A: and, B: I don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental. A: Nope. B: Uh, it's not as peppy as a, as a Town Car A: Right. B: because it's a V Six, B: but it, uh, B: I I drove it from here to Memphis B: and I really enjoyed driving that car. B: If I was going to buy a Ford product, that's what I would buy. A: Yeah. A: I drove mine a couple weeks ago to our, one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville. A: I usually fly. A: I drove it with another one of my guy that worked for me. A: We drove it ten hours to Nashville, A: and it, it handled real well, A: but, my main thing is space, A: so if a Continental, A: I might consider it the next time, A: a Continental has more trunk space. B: You might take a look at them. B: They, they had a, a lot more trunk space. B: As a matter of fact, they had more trunk space than my, uh, Sedan De Ville had. A: You always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs? B: Uh, all three of mine have had leather interiors, B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: I like leather interiors also. B: Uh, I had a eighty Eldorado, which was leather B: and, uh, then my eighty-six was a touring sedan. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, it had the gray leather package in it B: and my Allante has, uh I guess saddle, saddle colored type thing. A: That's a nice car. A: You bet, A: and I'll, I will say one thing about Cadillacs versus, A: Uh, so my favorite team is about the Rangers. B: Is it? B: I'd have to agree with that. B: They are my favorite team, too. A: Yeah. B: A little disappointing the last few years. A: I'm telling you. A: You think they'll sign Ruben? B: You know I really don't. A: No? B: I just don't think, you know, with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money, twenty-seven or twenty-nine million or whatever it was, I just don't think that they're going to be able to sign Ruben Sierra B: and it's just going to be a shame for, you know, our area. A: Right. A: Yeah, A: I think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other, uh, Hispanic players. B: Oh, I do, too. B: I just, A: I think that's going to be the big problem. B: The main thing, B: It's just going to effect on the, the team, you know. A: Right. B: We just can't seem to, you know, B: I think we've been in this spot, B: I think we finished second once or maybe even twice. B: I don't know, B: I I'm, I haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years. A: Yeah. B: It's just, it's just too disappointing. B: I just watch them fall every year. A: Right. B: I was a Pete Incaviglia fan B: and, uh I liked him, A: Oh. B: but, of course, I understand baseball decisions are all just, B: decisions like that have to be made by someone B: Glad it's not me making them. A: Right A: I think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here. A: But, B: They say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentine will be there. A: Right. A: Right, A: yeah. B: So, and that's the name of the game, too. B: You got to make money. You know, pay these players so much money, A: Right. B: now, it's just it's frightening. A: Right. B: You and I should be so lucky to, you know, to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that. A: That's true. A: But, uh, they were talking about trading him, if they're not able to sign him and, uh, use the money that it would take to sign the guy, you know, to pay for pitchers or, you know, what it, what it, what they, what else they need. A: Because they've got the hitting, A: but they need the pitching. B: Yeah, B: they really do. A: Um. B: I think they, uh, I think they need them all. B: I just don't I understand the big cities, like in New York or L A or somewhere because big cities B: and, you know, a guy, a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a at a men's clothing store, or something, or sporting goods store, A: Oh, I know. B: but, I realize the difference, B: but, I just don't understand, A: Yeah, A: it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working, you know, your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game. B: Oh, I know. B: I tell you. A: It's real aggravating, A: but, B: But, one thing I don't understand is why a group, you know, headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them B: because I tell you, we need a winner in this town. B: It looks like our Cowboys are coming back B: but, So that's, that's going to be a big help to Dallas, A: That's right. B: but, you know, in the past half a dozen years, all we've had is the, uh the soccer team. A: It's always got, A: Yeah, A: it's always, it's always wondered me why, I mean, they act as though this area is not, you know, a big metropolitan area, A: but you think we'd, someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the, the, the players we need. B: Oh, I know. B: It's, A: Just real aggravating to A: because I've lived here, you know, since, well, I was born and raised here, A: so I've been a Ranger fan since about seventy-seven, A: so it's a lot of losers B: Oh, I know. A: It's about to get, you know as bad as the Cubs or whoever, you know. B: I've been one, B: Yeah, B: I've been, I've lived here since seventy-four B: and I've really been a Ranger fan for the longest time B: and excuse me, I don't miss a time picking up the morning paper and checking the box score. A: Right. B: I mean I follow them B: and I follow them like I follow the Mavericks and like I follow the Cowboys, B: but, and I want to see them win, because you know, damn it, they, the fans deserve it. B: I mean, it, You know, we have pretty, uh, great fans, put two million people in that stadium. A: Right. A: I'm telling you. B: I love Nolan Ryan. B: I guess you probably love him, too. A: Right, A: I think this town would go crazy if they ever got a, even a playoff team. B: Oh, I do, too. A: I mean, It would be packed. A: And they got that new stadium they are building. A: So, at least, at least that will be exciting when we get that, B: It will. A: but, B: Well, where do you think they are heading this year? A: Uh, it's hard to say. A: It's going to be depending on where the, what they do with Ruben Sierra A: and, uh, I mean, I'm getting tired of them going into each year saying, you know, Bobby Witt is the answer and Kevin Brown is the answer, B: Right A: and, man, that's getting old, you know. A: These guys have been pampered. A: I mean, it's time to, to either, you know, put out or shut up. B: Yeah, B: Bobby Witt gets forced into wins like seventeen games or whatever A: And, B: and they have the later ten game winning streak A: Right. B: and they give him all kinds of money B: and then he just goes right down the tubes. A: And Valentine and Greave, they're about to get, you know, they're about to get old. A: But I like this Sandy Johnson. A: Hello. B: Yes, B: I forgot we had to hit one B: Our time will be up. A: Well, I hit one and nothing happened. A: What's going on? B: Well, just go ahead and talk, B: that's all. A: Are you sure? B: Yeah. A: Don't they usually tell you to say something? B: I don't think so. A: Oh. B: Uh-huh. A: Okay, A: we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden. B: Yes, B: I'm, I'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden. A: What do I do? B: Uh-huh. A: Well, I, uh, I cut it occasionally. B: Good. B: Uh-huh, B: you're ahead of me. A: Is, uh, is that good? A: Okay. B: That's better. A: And I edge it occasionally. B: Oh, that's really good. A: Yeah, A: see, am I good, or what? B: Yeah. A: And, uh, Uh, much beyond that I don't do B: I don't do any of that. B: Really, B: well, I call my lawn man, Eric, whatever his name is, I can't remember. Who's going to come and build me a fence, too. A: Uh-huh. A: Oh, he is going to build you a fence. B: Well, he's giving me an estimate. A: Uh-huh. B: And for ten dollars a week, I don't see any reason for me to be doing it. A: What, for a fence? A: Oh, well, I thought, isn't he the same one? B: he is. A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: but ten dollars, or what what does he charge, not even that. B: What does he charge me? A: Well, my, A: I don't know. B: It's like next to nothing. B: it's ten because I, B: it's forty a month. A: Yeah. B: But if there's five weeks, I still pay forty. A: Yeah, A: but you know, you ought to get him to pull the weeds. B: Well, he won't pull weeds. B: He says he'll spray them, B: but he won't pull them. A: Oh. B: Uh, he won't cut them is what he won't do. Because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the, the trimmer over the rocks A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: Uh-huh. B: and he's right. A: Yeah. B: That's true. B: But he just says to keep spraying them so, A: Well so, B: Anyway, Gene sprayed them once or twice for me B: so that was real, A: Yeah, A: so you haven't, you haven't pulled any weeds lately? B: No. B: No. B: There are two out front B: I thought I'd grab one of these days, B: but I haven't bothered as I walk on by. A: Yeah. B: I started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front A: Uh-huh. B: and all of a sudden I came cross this big clump of weeds B: and there was dog dirt in it A: Oh, oh, goody. B: and I threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there B: and I left the whole thing B: and that was about a month ago. A: I thought you were going to say there I thought you were going to say there was a snake in the weeds B: I would rather a snake, B: no A: Oh, God, oh B: I just left the whole thing. B: The bag is still out there because I haven't touched it. A: Yeah. B: I haven't gone back over there. B: It really made me mad. A: Oh, God. B: So anyway but, A: But, uh, how are your, your flowers, your little things you planted? A: Did they die or what? B: Oh, yeah, B: now they died. A: Oh, they're all, A: so they, oh, A: are they going to come back in the spring? B: I don't know. A: Oh. B: I don't know, B: and then I got some nice, uh, mums at Thanksgiving that I put in the pots out there A: Uh-huh. B: and I thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather. A: Yeah. B: They looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas, B: then they started to die, too. A: Oh. B: So, I don't think any of it comes back B: but I don't know, A: Yeah. B: maybe these, B: sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to. A: I don't know, uh, B: So, A: Those flowers, remember those little ones you gave me? B: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: well, they're, I know they were still blooming up until about a, a few weeks ago. B: Really? A: Yeah. B: Well, that's good. B: They're the best kind. A: Yeah A: they, They're really pretty. B: They, they're like indestructible. B: They really grow nice B: and sometimes, they're not supposed to come back, B: but lots of times they do. A: Uh-huh. B: So, A: Yeah B: We'll see. B: They're letting us have a lot of time on this aren't they? A: Yeah, A: I mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes? B: But that's because we didn't hit one for a long time. A: We didn't disconnect, did we B: I hope not B: Neither one of us is getting paid for this. A: Boy, I hate to think I hate to think I'd be talking to you without getting paid B: Yeah, B: really, B: I know it. B: I can't believe this. B: I got somebody from Utah and somebody, A: What? A: Uh-huh. B: where was the person last night was from far away. A: You're kidding? A: Really? B: And we get each other down the street. B: This is so funny. A: Well, the, uh, A: I, I talked to someone woman from Oklahoma City and some woman from Dallas A: and that was it. B: Yeah, B: I've had Dallas, Arlington. B: I've had, uh, one Plano and then a lady from Brigham, Utah whose son lives in Plano on Ranier someplace. And then, uh, another state, A: Uh-huh. A: Wow. A: Really? B: I can't remember, B: but she told me about the Utah Jazz, B: we talked about basketball. A: Oh, really B: And I don't remember what, what the place was last night, B: but I'm thinking Colorado, A: Yeah. B: but I'm not sure B: I'd know the place, anyway. A: Uh-huh. B: So, A: I don't know, B: But mostly they're from the area. A: Yeah. B: It, A: Well, there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes. B: Not for me. A: Not for me either. B: You know, not not for me because all I have is rocks and weeds. A: What do I, A: Yeah, A: but I don't, you know, A: I, what do I do, cut it one, you know, and, and edge it A: and that's about it. B: I know. A: What do I do with it? B: I know, B: we're not typical Texans. A: No. A: What's going on, A: are they going to tell us to stop or what B: I don't know, B: I hope so. B: Come on, B: come on. A: Isn't it five minutes? B: I don't know. A: I, I mean, I'm all talked out about gardens. B: I know. B: Well, we can talk about something else. B: It's just a suggested topic. A: Oh, oh, it's just suggested? B: So, how's the baby, do you think A: What? B: How's the, A: We could talk, Let's talk about the baby. B: Let's talk about the baby. A: Do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan? B: Yeah, B: our budgeting plan includes me getting a job B: We're, we're at the point now, B: I I quit working about six months ago to start this house A: Uh-huh. B: and I'm out of cash B: and I'm not out of project yet. A: Oh, no. B: So, uh, I'm going to go back and do some consulting work. B: As far as budget's concerned, I'm, I'm fairly fortunate. B: Uh, we've, we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra, we can make it on what my wife makes. B: So, you know, the project's kind of halted until then. B: But as far as budgeting is concerned, you know, we have, uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, you know, B: we always put ten percent back, B: and that's a never touch. A: Uh, into savings. B: Yeah. A: Oh. B: Either savings or investment, one of the two, B: but we don't ever put it in a high risk. B: It's just always going to be there. A: Well, that's pretty good. B: And as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, uh, what I would call extravagant expenses, you know, B: we, uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food A: Boy, that's pretty good. B: and the rest of it, you know, we pile into the house. B: And, uh, you know, I'm fairly fortunate. B: I mean, our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm a little behind on that, A: Sure. B: but, uh, we're still making the payments on them. B: It's just, when you, B: see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home and do it yourself. A: Yeah, A: it's, it's tough here too. A: You have to have the contractor sign with you. B: Right, B: exactly. A: But it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it B: Yeah. A: , where I live, that is. B: And where I live, it, it's pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up, you don't get it finished, A: Uh-huh. B: the bank can eat the contractor. A: Oh, bad for him, huh. B: Yeah, B: bad for him. B: But, the homeowner can't be touched. A: Um. B: It's a homestead state. A: Is that right? B: Yeah, B: see right now if I quit paying any of my bills, B: the only thing they could do is cut off electricity. B: They can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes. Period. A: Wow. B: You know. They can take your car and your clothes and your, anything B: that's not the tools of your trade, B: but as far as, uh, you know you're pretty much bullet proof in this state. A: Well, that's kind of handy. B: Yeah. A: I just finished James Michener's TEXAS book. B: Uh-huh. A: Pretty interesting. B: Uh-huh. A: Texas has quite the history. B: Well, you know, we're, we're not ones to budget much, you know B: We just going to spend it all. A: That's kind of what we do. A: We, uh, we're L D S A: and so we pay ten percent tithing B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: and then, you know, we put I guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account. B: Uh-huh. A: But that sometimes we use for emergency type things. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, and my wife doesn't work. A: We're fortunate that way, that I make enough to do what we want to do. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: we're pretty, pretty fortunate as far as the, uh, the budgeting is concerned, because, you know, we don't have any long term debt. B: You know, uh, we paid cash for car. B: Well, we bought the car on time, one of them, B: but we, you know, we since paid it off. A: Well that's pretty. B: The land is paid for cash, B: so we don't have to worry about that. A: That's a great position to be in. B: Well, it's fraught with other problems A: Is that right? B: Yeah, B: I'm not very motivated A: Oh A: What kind of consulting do you do? B: Uh, systems consulting. Computerization for construction firms. A: Is that right? B: Yeah. A: I'm into computers, too. A: I I'm a E D P auditor. B: Right. B: Oh. A: And. B: You into mainframes? A: and P C s. B: oh really? A: Yeah. A: I'm just brushing up on, well, C plus plus. B: Are you really? A: Uh-huh. A: And, B: I just got that a few days ago. A: Three oh? B: Oh, gees, B: don't get me to lying. B: I bought it at a fire sale. A: Oh. B: This guy's place burned down, B: and he had a bunch of computer stuff, B: and, you know, I bought it all. B: It was two hundred bucks for everything he had. A: You got a buy. B: Well, some of it wasn't worth anything, you know. A: Sure. B: You know, a lot of the, uh, diskettes were just totally unusable. A: Melted, or Just wet A: or, B: Well, yeah B: , or wet A: Okay. B: But I did get out of there with, uh, Vermont Views, which is a huge, A: Okay, A: Cindy, you there? B: Yeah. A: Okay, A: what kind of dinner parties have you had? B: Well, I've had them, uh, where I've served up to twelve to sixteen people. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, and I had help with them. B: Uh, and part of them I did were like a buffet A: Uh-huh. B: and, uh, it, B: I had, uh, just different, uh, side dishes and appetizers B: and one of them that, that I'd remembered was, uh, some, uh, sausage hors d'oeuvres B: and, uh, anyhow, uh, you take, uh, a couple of, uh, cups of Bisquick and, uh, sausage, oh, like a, a Owens mild, A: Uh-huh. B: you can, I guess you could use the hot if you wanted to. A: Whatever you like, huh? B: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, you put that in B: and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and make it all doughy A: Uh-huh. B: and then, like, I just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes A: Um. B: and they are so good. A: Oh, that sounds delicious. B: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: It's making me hungry for them right now. A: Yeah. A: You know, I've made like little Swedish meatballs, A: but they're just made out of the beef, you know. And, uh, with spices and things in them. But never anything mixed with Bisquick. B: Have you? B: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. B: I, I've used that quite a bit B: and it, and it seems to work real well. A: Uh-huh. B: Uh, A: Um. B: And, uh, uh, when I've had so many people, uh, to feed, like I try to do a ham and a turkey B: and and, A: Yeah, A: that's my, that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time. B: Yeah. A: You know, I've, uh, I had an open house party here once when, after we moved in here, uh, which I had things like that, A: but I always cooked them ahead of time A: and then I just sliced them. You know, and had macaroni salad with, uh, shrimp in it. B: Uh-huh. A: Have you ever had that? B: No. B: What, A: Put some fresh, little fresh shrimp A: and it's, in your macaroni salad that you make. B: Uh-huh. A: The shrimp just gives it a really good flavor. B: Oh, I'll bet. A: Yeah, A: I don't like the can, but the fresh. B: Yeah. A: You know. B: I'll have to try that. A: Yeah, A: that was really good. B: I like things that are easy and, and, uh, nutritious. A: Yeah, A: right, A: right. A: But, uh, at, uh, Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner, you know. Which is kind of hard because you got so many people B: Uh-huh. A: and then by time you pass everything around, A: it seems like everything on your plate's cold. B: I know. B: I know A: So, B: Well, A: But anyhow, I, B: Thank God for microwaves, you know. A: Yeah, A: you can, always take your plate and just heat it up, you know. B: Yeah. A: But, uh, other than that, I, I don't have too many parties. A: Uh, you know, I have, like, maybe just a another couple over for dinner. B: Uh-huh. B: Uh-huh. A: But, uh, other than, than, than that I don't have, you know a whole bunch of people like except, except at Christmas B: Yeah. A: and I have my family. B: Right, B: well I don't anymore. B: it's been a few years B: and, and, uh, I don't have, you know, over a couple either B: and and, uh, I try to, uh, have everything all ready A: Uh-huh. B: and, and it, it just makes it a lot nicer where a don't spend all my time in the kitchen. A: Yeah, A: right. B: And, uh, Spaghetti A: Right. B: and, A: Yeah, A: that's easy. A: I always like to have that, too. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: Everybody seems to like that, too. B: I know, B: I don't think I've ever met anyone that didn't. A: No, A: everybody likes that. B: Yeah. A: And, then, uh, if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven, then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there, you know. Especially if a pork roast. B: Oh, yeah. A: That's what I love, with my B: I like it, too. B: I do, too. A: And, uh, other than that, in fact, I'm just thinking of what next weekend when the Super Bowl's on B: Uh-huh. A: I've asked a couple people to come over A: and I just, uh, had been thinking what to have for that B: Yeah. B: Well, have you had any good ideas yet? A: No A: not yet B: Oh, okay. A: No, A: and I, you know, I don't want to have to come away from the T V. A: I want something that I can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the T V. B: Yeah. A: You know, so, I'll think of something, just that we can munch on over there, you know. B: Yeah. A: And they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down. B: And that's the way to do it, too. A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: I think it's, you know what's I think is so nice is that in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you B: and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen. A: Yeah. B: And, And it makes an awful lot of difference, doesn't it? A: Preparing it, A: right. A: Oh, it sure does. B: Well, A: Well, when I was brought up, you know, we didn't, A: Uh, go ahead, A: tell me what you think. A: Do we get our money's worth? B: Hey, listen, if I had my way, I wouldn't pay my taxes. B: Not with the, not with some of the things that I hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things. A: Yeah, A: did you see SIXTY MINUTES last night? B: No, B: I did not. B: I, A: Well, they did a thing on the thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need. A: And, uh, it's staggering. B: Well, how does this grab you? How did this grab you? B: Uh, this, B: I, I mean, I'm, I'm a lady, B: but this, I heard this on a Christian program B: and it was, uh, about the N E A B: and, that's the National Endowment for Arts, B: and they fund, they funded this thing, this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money. A: Well, there are a lot of things that people, I think general, B: And then it just frosts me terribly. A: Well, I think it's interesting to look at, uh, where the money goes, A: and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go A: and and I don't think generally, I think what's interesting is that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government B: Absolutely. A: and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with. B: I believe that's true, B: yes. A: And that, what I think is going to be really interesting is what we do about it. A: I mean, we are going to have to change the people who represent us. B: That's correct. A: I mean, and I think it's going to be real interesting to see and, and then force upon them, uh, B: Heavy involvement from the public. A: Yeah, A: right that's I think that's the only thing that's going to change it. B: Uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: heavy involvement from the public. A: Our anger is going to have to, to give rise to, to more activity on our part. B: Yeah. A: Uh, I've, I've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active A: and in our society, uh, there's very little full employment. A: Most people in this country are getting worse off, not better off. B: Absolutely. A: Eighty percent of the public, according to Bill Moyers', uh, A: recent, uh, A: piece for, uh, A: Public Broadcasting, which, by the way is a very good use of government money. I think P B S is wonderful. A: But this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are, are seeing their real incomes, A: and thus, standards of living, decline. A: And twenty percent are seeing theirs improve. A: That's not a formula for a better society. B: No, B: it is not. B: It's lopsided, very much B: so. A: And the government really plays a role in this. B: Uh-huh, B: that's right, B: they pull the strings. A: I mean, well, they are the people whose strings are pulled and by I guess powerful B: Right, B: the, B: yeah A: You know, and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of, of the voter revolting. A: But people are pretty much getting the used to work for Frito Lay as a typist. B: You know, transcribing stuff into the computer. A: Huh-uh. B: Well, she could type about one-hundred and five words per minute, B: but she don't like it. B: She just doesn't like to do that. B: I mean, she will. A: Yeah. B: But, you know, her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is have ... A: Um, what kind of hobbies do you have? B: Um, I do a lot of cross-stitching and painting, when I do have spare time. A: Really, A: I like cross-stitch too. B: Oh, I love it. A: I just have a hard time finding any spare time lately. B: That's my case also. B: I've got a new born B: and there's just no time. A: Uh-huh. B: Have you been cross-stitching long? A: Oh, several years. A: My husband is even interested in it now. A: He likes to help me design, um, you know, projects that are, a little more customized. B: Oh, really. B: Mine, sort of, he looks at the pattern B: and he says how do you get that from there to the material A: Not that hard. B: Oh, it's not. A: I really enjoy it. A: Uh-huh. B: I do a lot of my own patterns also. A: Yeah. B: In fact, I did one, BILL THE CAT, you know, from Glenn County that, uh, was a real good one to do. A: Oh, yeah. B: It was tough, B: but, uh, yeah. B: Do you have any others, B: or is this mainly cross-stitching? A: Um, I do mostly that, um, A: not very artistic really for like painting and stuff. B: Oh, uh-huh. B: Um, Yeah. A: But, now I don't know. B: I'm still trying to get all the D M C colors A: Oh, really A: Yeah, A: I've got the kits to put them all in. A: I don't have them all yet certainly. B: Yeah, B: right. B: Yeah. B: Yeah. B: I got to counting the other day B: and, uh, I think I have, what was it two hundred, B: and I got to thinking the money that I've got invested in this is, uh, B: it, yeah, it can add up quick. A: Oh, yeah. A: I just, I just keep an inventory of what I currently have, A: and then when I start a new project, I go through and see if I, if I, you know, A: just buy the colors that I need of what I'm low on. B: Uh-huh. B: Right. B: I see. B: Well, now can I improvise with adding and using another color instead, you know, what comes close. Because a lot of them are similar. A: Uh-huh. A: Yeah. A: A lot of times you can do that. A: I think, I A: the pinks, there's like forty-two different shades of pink. B: Good grief B: Yeah, B: there's lots of pinks and greens. A: Pinks and greens. A: Yeah. B: There's lots of shades of greens. B: But the colors, B: I just love all the different colors. A: Yeah. B: They had quite a few new ones come out last year, that they added to. B: But, you don't have much spare time either? A: Well, not lately A: I just started a new job and trying to get acclimated there. B: Oh, yes. B: And that does take some time. B: And if we're trying to get acclimated with the, uh, with having a baby, B: and . A: Yeah. A: How old? B: He's seven months old. A: Oh, yeah. B: And just into everything, B: so there's not a spare moment. B: Oh, but I wouldn't trade it for the world. B: I've been trying to do some bibs for him. And, uh, work on his Christmas stocking. A: Oh, yeah. A: Yeah. B: We missed it last year, B: so hopefully this year he'll have one. A: Yeah. A: Well, last year he was a little bit young for having one. B: Right. A: He wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway A: You would have A: but, B: Right. B: If it tasted good, yeah. B: All he liked was the lights this year, B: so. A: Oh, yeah. B: Oh, well, that's neat that you like cross-stitching also. A: Yeah, A: that's, that's kind of strange that we got the same call. B: Yeah. A: It's a call. B: Oh, I'm sorry. B: Go ahead. A: No, A: that's okay. B: Okay uh, B: but, yeah, B: I've been doing it for probably ten years or so. A: Oh, wow. A: No, A: I just started about, well, five years ago, I think. B: But it is peaceful, B: I mean it is relaxing to do, once you find the time to do it. A: Uh-huh A: There's also a couple of large projects, baby afghans, A: and I got one done A: and I think the other one is going. The child is going to be in high school before I get finished. B: On that, uh A: Bear thing . B: is it one of those afghans that I've seen in the packages with the, with the large squares? A: Well, yeah A: I just, I bought the cloth and the pattern for it. A: I didn't, um, I didn't buy the, uh, I didn't buy a kit. B: Oh, uh-huh. B: Well I've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for cross-stitching. A: Uh-huh. A: It's that cloth. B: Oh, okay. A: It's cloth I think. B: Uh-huh. A: And it has the borders and everything already. B: Yeah. B: Those are pretty. A: Number one turned out just great, A: and the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that I had done it in the colors, that they had decorated the nursery A: and I didn't even know it. B: Oh, that's a . A: I gave it to her A: and she said how did you know those are the colors we used. A: I said didn't B: That was a good . A: It worked out that way. B: That's great. B: Uh, that, uh, B: now I've got the material to do an afghan that I just never did get around to finishing it. A: Uh-huh. B: I like those. B: Those are pretty. A: Yeah. A: Lilly, Lilly , she said, she said it's for your daughter to use. A: Oh, no. A: She said, I know she doesn't get to touch it. A: She hung it on the wall. B: Yes, B: my, uh, grandmother, um, made us a couple of quilts for the baby, B: and I was like, oh, I don't want to mess those up. A: Yeah B: Uh, they're just too nice. B: I mean you don't get many hand made quilts anymore. A: Yeah. B: Oh, yeah. A: True. B: Well, I've enjoyed this. A: Okay. B: But, uh, well keep up the good, um, B: keep up the cross-stitching. A: You too. B: All right, B: thanks. A: Uh-huh, A: bye bye. B: Bye bye. A: I was trying to think about some of my favorite people that I liked in music A: and they're, none of them are recent, right. B: Uh-huh. A: So I like Gordon Lightfoot, A: do you know who he is? B: Yeah A: And the Moody Blues, A: and I like to listen to piano music a whole lot, A: and Willie Nelson. B: Uh-huh. B: So you like a, a variety. A: Yeah. B: Sort of easy listening because you like country B: but then, A: But not all country. A: I don't like that, when they start, B: Um. A: I don't know. A: I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he's such a character. B: Oh, uh-huh. B: Yeah, B: I, I like some of his songs, though. B: They're, they're not so, they're not so sad country all the time. B: They're just kind of sweet sometimes. A: Yeah. B: You know, I mean they're not the, the typical country where they're just, you know, my wife left me, my dog left me, you know A: My truck is broken down. B: Yeah, B: my truck's broken down B: and my house just burned down, you know. A: Yeah. B: But, A: There, there's a guy, A: have you ever heard of George Winston, A: he plays piano. B: No. A: I think he's dead now, A: but he plays wonderfully. B: Uh-huh. A: I like that. B: Are, are you, do you play the piano, B: is, B: or you just like it? A: Very badly. A: I've got a piano, B: Yeah. A: my mother got a piano A: and, uh, vowed that someone in the family was going to learn, A: so we all had to take lessons, A: and I was the one that did the least poorly, A: so she gave it to me. A: And it's sitting here mostly taking up space, A: but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it. A: It is real relaxing. B: Yeah, B: it must be fun to be able to play it B: and, you know, if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be, it'd be kind of fun, I think. A: Yeah. B: because I mean, I play the flute B: and not many things you can play that'll, you know, people will sit there and sing along to B: and you can't sing along either B: so, but, uh, I like a lot, uh, B: I like classical music just because of the, B: when, I, I don't play, B: I like jazz music B: but A: Oh, so do I. B: What's that? A: Forgot about that. B: What's that? A: I said so do I, A: I forgot about jazz B: Yeah, B: I like a lot, like, B: I like, uh, is it the New Age music, like with, uh, uh, the, B: I don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection. A: Yes, A: we've got about five of those. A: I love them. B: Yeah, B: I love those, too. B: They're just so relaxing. A: Uh-huh. A: I'd never heard them before until I went in a music store A: and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it B: Yeah. A: and I just, I heard a piece A: and it was just so wonderful. B: Yeah. A: And then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it. B: Isn't that nice. B: I mean it's nice when you have a piece that, that is so, so peaceful, that everybody likes, you know, A: Yeah. B: and, uh, it, it, it, it, you know, it has pieces that are uplifting, B: but, it, it's mostly relaxing B: and you don't, because it doesn't have words, you know, you don't feel like, there's anything you have to remember, you know, as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean B: or, but, uh, A: I mean you can just sit, A: you know those little booklets that come along with it B: Yeah. A: and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music. B: Yeah. A: My, my little boy has gotten so into it that A: he's identified the, the people that have written certain songs, A: then he buys the pieces that have that person. You know, on it. B: Yeah. B: Oh, I see what you're saying. A: Huh? B: Yeah. A: I mean, I don't even know who did which ones, A: but he does. B: I, I can't identify them either. B: I just like them. B: I could, I know which ones come next, B: but I don't even know their names. B: Most of them I don't know their names of the song, B: but I, I can identify them. B: But I like that B: and I like, uh, course I, I like classical music. A: Yeah. B: And, uh, A: Were you in the band? B: I was in the band, B: yeah A: So was I. B: and I was in, like, chamber music groups and stuff, B: so I'm used to pieces B: and, and I played classical flute, B: I didn't play, play jazz flute or anything like that, B: so. I I can relate to it, I suppose B: But, uh, and I like, I'm like you I like the older stuff, too, B: because I like Chicago A: Yeah. B: and I like I like, uh, uh, let me think who, uh, B: you don't know Hebert Laws, B: but Hebert Laws a flute player, B: he's a jazz flute player B: and I like, uh, uh, Chuck Mangione, B: do you know who Chuck Mangione is? A: Yeah. B: Yeah, B: I like Chuck Mangione B: Trying to think of all, uh, oh, B: what's his name, plays the trumpet. Yeah. A: I like the Moody Blues. A: Did you like them? B: Yeah, B: I like Moody Blues. B: I, I like mostly the older groups I think. B: Oh, B: but we do have, B: I like Simply Red, B: we got Simply Red. B: I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like B: And, uh, I like Breeze, B: I like the group. B: I think just because they all sort of sound, they sound a lot like uh, Simply Red. Uh. A: So what type, Simply Red, A: I've never heard of that. A: Is it just instrumental? B: No, B: it's, it's got people singing, B: but it's it is instrumental. B: But it's, it's got people singing B: but it's got a, like a whole bunch of people singing. A: Yeah. B: You know, how many people are in Simply Red, Stuart to someone else in the B: he can't hear me. B: I, I don't remember how many people, B: but, it's, it's got men and women B: and it's not, it's, it's nice, B: I mean it's pleasant, you know, music. B: It's not where it's, it hurts your ears to hear it. B: But it's not as, it's not like, uh, Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it. B: You know, it doesn't have, like all the brass and everything. A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: Well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road A: We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend. A: And, then I'm going to go to Sulphur Springs. B: Oh, you must live in this area. A: Yeah, A: where are you? B: We're in Sherman. A: Okay. A: So we're in Garland. B: Oh, okay. B: You're going to Commerce? A: Yeah B: For East Texas or something? A: Yeah, A: yeah. B: Oh, okay. A: Just because there's a friend up there, A: not because there's much else B: Oh, okay. B: Well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas. B: That's why I was just A: For colleges? B: Yeah, B: East Texas is recruiting for, you know, their fall semester A: Well, they're not B: and they're, they've been doing a lot of that in the area. A: They're not going to recruit me anymore, A: I'm through. A: No more for me. B: No more, huh. A: What, what do you do? B: Well, right now I'm just a homemaker, B: but I'm going to school, uh, for legal assistant B: and that's what I know, B: so, and, uh, just nothing basically A: Are you going to go to East Texas for that? B: No, B: no, B: it, B: no B: I don't go to East Texas. B: I got a degree from T W U, B: but I'm really interested in legal, you know, in the legal environment, B: but I don't want to be a lawyer B: so I said well, I think I'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant. A: That'd probably be pretty interesting. A: I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week. A: They had summonsed eight hundred people, A: about four hundred showed up, A: and it was for a murder trial. B: Oh, uh-huh. A: This guy had supposedly, uh, strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose A: Anyway, this is happened in nineteen eighty-three. B: Yeah. A: And they had us fill out a long questionnaire. A: We stayed till about one thirty A: and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time A: and the trial won't take place until June. B: Yeah, B: that's how it works. A: And they say it's going to last about two to three weeks. A: And this guy in front of me said, I can't believe I was summonsed. A: I was an investigator A: and I was tailing the woman that was killed. A: Well, then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer A: and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband A: and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it. A: And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been, uh, getting cocaine from his client and then selling it, A: and he had skipped bail A: and they finally extradited him A: and he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced. B: And this is the man that was in front of you? A: Yeah. B: Oh, well they'll, weed him out. A: The, the investigator. A: Yeah, A: he, he got off right away. B: Yeah. A: And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that, B: Uh-huh. A: so I figure that that will make me biased A: and I won't be chosen. B: Well, not necessarily A: Hopefully B: but there's probably something else that might make you. B: Because you could know about, you could know about the crime, but not necessarily be taken off the jury, you know, not be accepted for the jury. A: Yeah. No. *aa B: I mean, pretty much a lot of people would know about it, you know, and, and know some of the different things about it B: but, uh, they, they might weed you out some other way. B: You know, if you, if you don't believe, like if this was a capital crime and, and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty, you're not going to be picked at all. B: So but, A: I said that, I could believe in it in certain instances, but I would be, I'd find it hard to levy that against somebody. B: Yeah, B: so, see, there, there they would have a doubt about you, that, you know, A: You know. A: Uh-huh. B: because if that's what, if that's what the punishment is in that, in that instance, then you're always going to say, you know, not B: you're, you're not going to want to have him have that uh, that punishment. B: So, A: Yeah. A: But then when you're, when you're picked, A: see I was picked for another murder trial before B: Uh-huh. A: oh, gosh and it's so hard because, you know, everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done, A: and if you're trying to hold out, you know, there's so much pressure on you A: and you've got to come up with a decision. B: Well, especially with something where you have to you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt. B: You have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt B: and it's like, do you really feel that sure about, B: Okay, B: well personally, I don't have any children. B: I'm twenty-two B: and I'm doing my Master's at N C State A: Oh, uh-huh. B: so, uh, uh, children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now. A: Well, no, A: would they, A: no. B: So what, what, how do you spend the time with your children? A: Well both of mine are boys. A: They're eight and eleven B: Um. B: Okay, B: and did, A: and they're into sports B: Yeah. A: I mean, as a matter of fact, that's what we're doing tonight B: What, what are you doing? A: Baseball has started. B: Oh, okay. B: Do, do they play like, uh, like does the eight year old play baseball? A: Oh, oh, yes, A: we start here at, uh, five. B: Okay, B: and, and in, in his league do they have like a pitcher, B: or do they have a standing ball or a machine, or what? A: Up until, A: it's coach pitch, until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May. B: Okay. A: So he's going to be with, uh, regular pitching B: Oh, okay. A: and my eleven year old, of course, you know, is pitching. B: Yeah. B: I, I used to play soccer when I was that age up in New York, A: Uh-huh. B: so. A: But yes, A: we're into baseball, A: and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball. A: We even have peewee basketball here. A: So there's always something. B: Yeah, B: and how about, how about like on the weekends. B: Do you do sports B: or do you go out? A: Both. A: If we're not doing sports we go somewhere. B: Do you go, how about like for, uh, do you go for long vacations, like a week or something when they have school off? A: Oh, yeah, A: yeah, A: yeah. B: In the summer or like in the Easter time, like around now? A: No, A: usually in the summer time. B: And where do you go? A: Different places every year. A: We, B: Have, have you been out of the country? A: No B: Oh, okay, B: well, first, they always say, get to know your country first before you leave, B: I mean I, I lived in places, like A: Uh-huh. B: when I lived in Washington, uh, Washington, D C, I never went to the Washington Memorial, B: and then when I went back to visit, I went to the Washington Memorial. A: You know, I've heard, we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often, A: and that must be the thing. A: They really hadn't either. A: They went to the Memorial, you know, A: when they go, it's on business B: Right. A: it's not really just to getting to sight see. B: Right. B: Well, it's, it's a beautiful city. A: Oh, I bet it is, too. B: But, the problem is , like first time I went out of here, and they took me to Las Vegas A: Uh-huh. B: and that was the most boring place on earth. A: Oh, now my husband and I, we go different places. A: But our but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close. B: Yeah. B: Did, uh, did, like, did you go to Disneyland? A: Oh, yes, A: yes, A: yes. B: Oh, okay. B: So, but um, now, I don't know, B: but um, but let's see, B: when I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean. A: Oh. B: and, uh, then after that, I, B: my sister lives in Turkey, B: so when I was like fourteen, fifteen, I went, I went to Turkey. A: Oh, B: And this Christmas, I went to Turkey. B: But basically, it's a, B: for the past couple of years, I, B: since my parents are, are, well, B: I'm from Argentina, B: and my parents live down there. B: So, all the traveling I do is alone. A: Uh-huh. B: And, uh, we were never much of, B: uh, a very, uh, family thing, you know, made, like go skiing in Vermont or something. A: Uh-huh. B: That was, uh, that was a lot of fun. A: Yes. B: But, what happens is we used to fight a lot, B: so there's never much of a family family thing. B: You know, one of those hell family vacations. A: Oh, yes, A: but we try, you know, I try, A: my husband also, we're involved in everything our kids does B: Yeah. A: because, uh, my dad died, you know, when I was less than a year old B: Yeah. A: so I always just had a mother. A: So I always thought, when I have kids, you know, I really want to be involved with them. B: Well, my dad, all he, all he wanted to do was get money for us, B: so he could buy us material things. A: Material things, A: yes, A: that is, A: yes, B: And, and to me, you know, it's like, now I'm twenty-two, B: but I still feel, you know, B: it's like yeah, we never threw a football or something A: Uh-huh. B: and the way I was brought up, B: and he wants me now, B: he, like he, you know, like he wants to be best friends now A: Best friends, now. B: and it's very hard for me B: because, you know, it's like you grow up to be twenty years old, B: and it's always the same man A: Uh-huh. B: and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old, B: and he wants to be best friends A: Yeah. B: but, uh, you know, it's like, I can only express myself so much, B: because, you know, um, everything that he taught me, you know, that my family taught me, which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say, I'm sorry, you know. B: It's like, you know, I love you B: and let's go out and do things together when I don't feel like it, you know A: Uh-huh. B: and so, that's that whole thing that he'll say when, like, like B: I've seen my uncle and his family, you know, does everything together, B: and you know, his kids are, you know, B: when his little girl was five years old and everything, they, uh, they would go to the beach, B: and she could go to sleep at two in the morning you know A: Oh, uh-huh. A: Yeah. B: and, uh, I was brought up the same way, B: it doesn't matter what age you have, B: just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning, you can stay up you know, A: Uh-huh. B: but his, what he does is, when he gets home, he separates his work from his house. A: Yeah, A: you have to B: Yeah. A: I mean, you honestly do. A: Now I have friends that I love to death, A: but, and they have children, A: but their children does anything, A: we have to take them, and, you know to do it. B: Yeah. A: And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while A: because you're saying, Well, I work full time too, you know. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: but, uh, it's just, it's just something that, you know, B: my theory is, you know, when, when you have kids and all you, you want to do, well, B: what I'll do is, you know, like, B: I mean, you might have problems, B: but it's not your kids' problems you know, A: Yeah, A: oh, yeah. B: and you got to try to be with them as much as you can B: and to, you know, like, B: thing is, is, that, you know, like if, if they would ever happen to have a drug problem, suppose, that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying, I got a problem you know, A: Problem, A: uh-huh B: and, uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time, you know, A: Yeah. B: first of all you're coming to me B: and let's see how we can get rid of the problem, you know, B: and that's uh, that's very, that's very hard to do, B: because once you're best friends with your parents, then, I think everything go a lot better. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah, A: I agree with you very much so. A: Now, we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college, A: and we knew time wise, or, and money wise, too B: Yeah. A: would, it would not have been a good idea to had them then. B: Yeah, B: my, my father was raising four oh well, three kids before he had me, B: so it was, uh, you know, B: you're trying, to support, uh, four kids, B: and it's pretty hard you know, A: Yeah. B: and I, I told him, listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids. A: Uh-huh, A: yeah. B: He says yeah, B: but then I wouldn't have you, B: I go, yeah, B: but then you would have a lot of money A: That's right, A: but you can't take this money with us, though B: Yeah. A: that's how I keep looking at it. B: But, you know, like, four, I mean four children is expensive, especially when you consider like, especially for me, which I'm paying out of state tuition. B: I'm paying, you know, three thousand, B: no, B: what is it, two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester. A: Oh. B: And, you know, people say, you know, it's expensive to think it's college, B: but, if, if everybody would be a little bit responsible, you know, B: it's like, B: what does it, what does it cost. B: It costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose. B: Now they go to a state college B: and they live at home you know, A: Uh-huh. B: and well, it costs two hundred dollars for books, B: but you know, seven hundred dollars a semester, B: a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead, you know, like A: Oh, yeah, A: if you if you can, A: yeah. B: I mean, it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know, one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college, you know. A: Yeah. A: What are you learning to be? B: Oh, oh, excuse me? A: What degree, I mean, what are you wanting to do after you get out of college? B: Well, I, I'm doing computer science, computer engineering. A: Oh, that's, A: my husband's into, uh, computers. B: Yeah, B: and, and now I'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home A: Uh-huh. B: because since I'm an international student, they want to send me back to Argentina. A: Yeah. B: Well, my dad wants me to go back. B: So. A: And you don't want to? B: No. A: No, A: no. B: No, B: because if you go back there, then you can never get out. A: Oh. B: Like you don't have any money to, to, get out. A: Oh. B: So, uh, and, uh, I was thinking, you know, like, Oh my God, you know, I go back there, B: and then, and I get married there, B: and now I have kids there, B: and then I'll never leave the place, you know. A: Then you'll never leave. B: Yeah, B: I know, B: and that's, that's what happened to my brother. B: He came to school up here, B: and then when he went down there, B: he was just so bad off, you know from not being able to stay up here that his life just went down the drain. A: Oh. A: Uh-huh. B: So. A: Well maybe something will open up for you. B: Yeah, B: I've been calling a lot of companies. B: There, B: some of them are interested. B: Well, at least for a year and a half I can work, A: Uh-huh. B: so. A: Well, A: well I've enjoyed talking to you. B: All right, B: same here. A: Okay, A: bye-bye. B: Bye-bye. A: All right. A: Well, on this subject, I really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet, A: but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home B: Uh-huh. A: so I've always been involved, you know, in one. B: How do you feel about them, I mean, since you've kind of been close to that. A: Well, I've Well, I can kind of see both sides, you know, A: I really can. A: Uh, nursing homes to me, A: I would personally be the last resort you know, I you know if I had to put someone in there. B: Uh-huh. B: Well, I've had a touch of experience. B: My, um, dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him A: Yeah, A: if it's a have to thing, A: yeah, A: I, A: yeah. B: and, uh, she put him in, B: but he wasn't there very long before he died A: Uh-huh. B: but, um, I guess, um, the one time that I saw him there, you know, as far as the surroundings, that seemed okay. A: Uh-huh. B: But, um, we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of, you know keep him real out of it all the time A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: and that's always kind of bothered me. A: Yeah. B: Uh-huh. A: that's like everything else, though. B: I have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home, B: but I've never actually been there A: Uh-huh. B: and I know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow, you know, a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: but, B: But still I'm sure there are, you know, aspects to it that aren't really desirable. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. A: Yeah, A: I know, A: I've always, A: well, my sister's involved in one also, A: and I really think they really do a wonderful job. A: But still there's those little things that happens, you know B: Yeah. A: there really is, which A: I think, it's a wonderful place, you know, if it comes to that, you know, if you just can't take care of them any more. B: Well, sometimes you don't have any other alternative A: Uh-huh, A: that's it. B: family and friends are usually, well family's tied up with their own lives and things, and usually working A: Uh-huh. A: Other things. B: and it's hard to, A: Yeah, A: yeah, A: yeah A: but I think when the time comes, I, I hope to have the time to really look around, you know and pick one that I really think my mother would be happy at. B: Yes. B: Uh-huh, B: I think that's important, too, B: in fact there's a, A: I do too. A: Outside's awful deceiving sometimes you know. B: Yes. B: There's one close to where my mother is, B: but in order to get in, you have to be able to, um, walk in on your own, B: in other words, you can't be in, you know, too bad a shape to start out with. A: Yeah. A: Yeah. B: But then if you deteriorate, um, they have a separate section for those who need care you know, all the time. A: yeah. A: Yeah. B: But it's always, well, B: and they have a long waiting list, too. B: So there's always this feeling of, well, golly gee, you know, you've got to be able to walk in the door, B: so you can't wait until you're too bad off A: Off, A: yeah. B: but then, you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like, uh, you have to give up your automobile or whatever. A: To, A: no. A: Uh-huh, A: and everything you worked so hard for all your life B: Yeah A: yeah. B: and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things, then you feel like, well, gee, I'm, you know, I'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment. A: Uh-huh. A: Uh-huh. B: So it's kind of a, that's a hard one, B: but it is a very nice nursing home. A: Now there is some really nice ones. A: There's also, you know, some private ones, you know B: Uh-huh. A: but of course, I would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that, you know, B: Yeah, B: that's the problem A: that's way out of my reach. B: the expense of it all is, B: and, uh, what I, another thing I hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money, and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately. A: Oh, yeah. B: But those who don't have money can go in and get the same care. You know A: Uh-huh A: the very same, A: yeah. B: So I don't like that aspect. A: No, A: but I, there's, I think there's ways around it, though, that, you know, A: like, they could put it in one of their children's names or something you know. B: Yeah. A: But still, a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that. A: You know, it's their money. B: That's right. A: You know, that's how I feel about it, anyway. B: Well, yeah, B: I've talked to my mother about that several times lately, B: and I, I said, I want you to have control of your own business. A: Yes. B: But, you know, what if. A: Yeah, A: my mother's seventy now, A: so naturally she's retired, A: but she's still on her own, I mean. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: my mother's, uh, seventy-five and still has her own home and everything. A: I think that's wonderful, A: I really do, A: just as long as they can, A: and then on the other hand, I've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know. B: Yeah. B: That's true. B: They have a lot of people around to do things with. A: Uh-huh, A: they're not lonely. B: Some of those places have wonderful activities and things, you know, lots of stuff going on. A: Oh, yes, A: uh-huh. B: And they'll take them places A: Yeah. B: so. I don't know, B: it's not all bad A: No. B: but I guess once you get ill, then, you know, you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things. A: Around, A: yeah. A: But I really don't know what the other solution would be you know, B: No. A: I really don't. A: But no, A: when the time comes I'm really, hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents B: Uh-huh. A: really do, A: because I have been raised in one, you know, A: so there's lot of things I know to look for. B: Yeah. A: And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know B: Yeah. A: I really don't. B: That might be kind of tough, huh. A: It really would, A: yes, A: yes, A: and like I said, my sister's still in it, A: and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there, either. A: Oh. A: Well, it's been nice talking to you. B: Well, you too. A: And I guess we'd better get back to work, huh. B: Okay. A: All right. A: Bye-bye. B: Bye. B: Well, in the in a normal route of way we do things, how about the ladies go first? A: All righty A: Um, well, I, uh, have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year, A: so I'm really just starting to get involved in, uh, in what's out there and how they do things. A: Um, as far as the system as a whole, I really don't see a problem with it. A: I do see a problem with graduating people that, that can't read and are not, you know, productive in society or productive to themselves A: and, uh, I think that's the main problem at this point. A: How about yourself? B: All right. B: I 'm, live in Plano, Texas B: and, uh, uh, today we're not even suppose to be in school because the, uh, the way the taxation and all that crap is, there really legally isn't any funding for the school systems in Texas today. A: Uh-huh. A: Right. B: So, uh, I mean, when you, when you take, uh, uh, professionals and put them in situations, they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education, B: and they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to, to get that major subject in line, B: something's wrong. B: So, I think here in Texas mainly that the, the, they're not serious, B: they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what, how the level of education should be for children. B: I have a one year old B: so I'm not, I'm more opinionated about the observations than, than the true facts, B: but, it's just a shame to me that, that the, our firemen, our policemen, and school teachers are the three least paid utilities, um, that have the biggest impact to our well-being. A: Uh-huh. A: That's true. B: I have, I have a real issue with that. B: Um, I think that if from every year when they, when they pull in the, the, the, uh, test that the last three years, you know, ten, eleven, twelve year, uh, graders take, B: and, and then you see that their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states. B: They're not saying that something's wrong with the educational system here in Texas, B: I have a real concern about that, um, B: as a matter of fact I'm very content to spend my daughter out of state to college in Virginia, uh, verses having her go down here and not learn anything, A: Uh-huh. B: and then, uh, so I'm, my opinion I think there's a big concern B: hope, hopefully the new, uh, education, secretary of education will do something to fix the problem B: but, uh, I don't know, B: they've got to quit worrying about, uh, the, uh, religious, uh, overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product. A: Yeah, A: I think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people, you know, special interest groups can blow up, and, uh, and not really get down to teaching what's important. B: Uh-huh. A: Teaching these kids, you know, how really the basics is what it comes down to. B: Exactly. B: I was astonished to find out that, that across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed. A: Is that right? B: they don't even, a lot of the school systems don't even, uh, the kids nowadays don't even know what, what the president's fitness education program is all about, A: Huh. B: they don't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school. A: I remember. B: And, yeah, B: and, uh, I talked to a thirteen year old last night who 's, uh, goes to, uh, one of the Plano high schools or junior highs, I guess, B: and she said that she had a choice, B: she could either have taken tennis, or weight lifting B: so she choice to take weight lifting, over the regular gym, B: I mean, give me a break, B: I mean, the kids sit there B: and they, and they drink cokes and eat popcorn for, for lunch B: and, then go out there and lift weights and don't learn anything, A: And talk, A: yeah. B: it's just a real, I have a real problem with the whole system. A: Huh. B: They need to put some sternness back into the, into the teachers and let them be able to, uh, get the old whip out and get some discipline. A: Yeah, A: then it comes down to what you said before though about them being some of the lowest paid public, you know, public service, employees that there are, B: Uh-huh. B: I used to, I used to date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level. A: and yet they're so important. A: Uh-huh. B: I mean, I was absolutely flabbergasted at what, they what she was paid. B: True, B: she was young, you know, B: but still it's the principle. A: Right. B: Of course, if she got her Master's degree it would all be different. B: But, uh, A: Well, you know, it's hard though because then you start talking taxes A: and, that's a bad word B: Oh, taxes Lord Lord forbid, taxes. B: Goodness gracious, if we would, uh, plan our expressways a little better, that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads, we'd cut that in half and get some teachers we might have us a problem A: There's an idea. B: Maybe I should run for office, huh? A: Run on that then, no income taxes in Texas, huh? B: That's true. A: I'm in Texas too, A: so, B: That's funny, B: that's funny. B: Well, that's about all I have here. A: Well me, too, A: I, uh, I think we both agree there's some problems there A: but, we'll, maybe do our small part to fix them up. B: ma'am. B: Surely. B: I've enjoyed it. A: All right, A: you too. B: Bye, bye. A: Bye. A: So, do you have any hobbies? B: Well, right at the present time nothing real special. B: I kind of like gardening B: and I'm kind of into camping and, you know, vacationing, that sort of thing. A: Yeah, uh, B: I don't have any real serious, A: I'm an avid gardener, oh, B: Oh, okay. B: I think you're , A: Um, I consider that a hobby. A: I don't know, A: they were like suggesting, like handcraft things which, B: Uh-huh. A: I guess that's a really true, true hobby, A: but I, I think anything that you enjoy, B: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: um, it doesn't really have to matter, A: I mean, it could be working on cars could be your hobby really. B: Really B: yeah, B: I kind of enjoy doing that a little bit, too. B: No, B: I, I guess if you make money at it, it becomes a vocation A: well, I don't know, A: I told my husband, I said, you go out some to work on the car, A: it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong. A: I says, you go pay to have someone do it. B: Yeah A: Because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something. B: I guess as far north as you are if you like gardening, you've still got a couple months to go, haven't you? A: Oh, yeah. A: Um, well, right now we, um, start our seeds inside. B: Uh-huh. B: Oh, yeah, B: that's right, B: you would, B: yeah. A: We'll start them inside A: and, uh, B: In cold frames or whatever the, A: Yeah, A: well, we usually start them right in the house. B: Uh-huh. A: My sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck A: and, and the and a wind storm come and knock it down. B: Huh. A: But she's had really good luck. A: I mean, A: next month, A: well, actually, it, if you, if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside, pretty much the end of May, A: you can leave them outside. B: Uh-huh. A: You might put them in the ground just the first week of June B: Yeah. A: but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of May. B: Yeah, B: I've, I've lived in, in Texas and New Mexico most of my life, B: but I did once, B: I spent one winter in North Dakota, A: Oh. B: and I, I remember that it was on into May before it really started warming up, B: and, uh A: Yeah, A: well, well, we live, we live really close to Lake Champlain, which is in the Champlain Valley, B: Oh, yeah. A: so we're a little, we're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts A: so, B: Okay, B: because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit? A: Yeah. B: Yeah. A: We are a little lucky. A: Well, my brother lives ten miles from here B: You're at, A: and he gets frost A: and, his crop gets killed. B: Yeah. B: You're right across the, uh, lake from, what, Plattsburgh? A: Yeah, A: from Plattsburgh Air Force Base. B: Yeah, B: yeah. A: But, um, B: Yeah, B: I had, I had a cousin that was stationed there, Plattsburgh for a while. B: He, he remembers lots of snow A: Yeah, A: Plattsburgh's kind of a, A: it's, uh, it's, uh, depressed economically. B: Oh, really, oh. A: When you go across the lake, um, A: I don't know why we have so much going for us, A: I really don't. A: I'm, just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at Digital A: and they've never had, well, they've had layoffs recently, A: but when we got hired here, no, no, never any layoffs, never, never, A: and now we're looking at serious, A: I, I mean, I'm a technician. B: Yeah. A: When they start getting rid of technicians, B: Yeah, B: well, I'm, I'm working for T I, Texas Instruments, down here. A: Well, I interviewed with them. B: Oh, yeah? A: But I didn't want to go to Texas. B: Oh, A: Even though my, um, mother's people are from Georgia. B: Oh, A: Yeah. B: yeah. A: Well, I guess we have to get back to hobbies since, B: Yeah, B: we're getting to where, we're straying, I guess, A: Stick on the subject. B: yeah. A: Well, interesting thing that I do is with, gardening, uh, A: my sister grows flowers that you can dry, B: Uh-huh. A: and you can make uh, dried flower arrangements A: and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun. A: And we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with, uh, dried red flowers and dried white flowers and, uh, eucalyptus. B: Huh, yeah. A: you know what eucalyptus is? A: It's, B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: the, they uh, it's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries. A: Yeah, A: it's got a B: It's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it B: but, A: Yeah, A: at first I'm like, oh, how, why do people like this, A: but it, it is kind of a nice smell after a while. A: People put them in, B: Yeah, B: I didn't realize what it was for a while. B: I'd walk into a room where some of that, B: and I'd wonder what is that, you know, B: and then one day I, I realized that it was eucalyptus. A: it's, it's, it's, uh, like a fad thing. A: I, I don't know. A: It's, I've never heard of it, A: in the last five years I've used so much of it that, B: Yeah. A: I hate, B: Is that the stuff that koala bears eat in Australia or something? A: Yeah, A: it is. B: Maybe that's why they're so slow. B: I guess they're stoned on the stuff or something. A: Yeah, A: it, it looks really potent stuff. B: Yeah B: yeah. A: But, uh, it's, yeah, I think it's the greatest stuff in the world, though. A: It's, jeez, A: they, I make all kinds of things with it. A: We make all kinds of things just with dried flowers. A: I, I almost want to start a business doing it, A: but I don't, I, I'm so, uh, timid when it comes to starting a business. B: Yeah, B: that's, that's a big step, B: yeah. A: Yeah, A: it is, especially with the, being in on the creative aspect and the crafty end. B: Yeah, uh, A: You know, after a while you make some stuff, A: then you start looking at it, A: go, boy, this, this is kind of ugly A: But I know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby. A: Um, he does it, believe it or not, I wouldn't imagine why, but to get out of the house, away from his wife, A: because he's a seasonal worker, A: he works in the construction. A: And up here it's almost a pattern, A: and you see your fathers do it, A: then their sons do it. A: What they do is they work construction, A: then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter. A: And, uh, this guy was going nuts, A: and his, uh, son built him a garage and got him some, uh, oh, I don't know what the equipment's called, but planers and things and set him up, B: Uh-huh, B: shapers and planers and routers. A: and he makes, all kinds of furniture for, um, his kids, A: and he makes, uh, uh, like little kids' furniture. A: He gets right into it A: and, uh, B: There was a program on T V down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little, little companies of one and two guys, you know, up there, B: this particular one, I think, was in Maine and New Hampshire, where out in the, just kind of out in these little towns they'd be in, B: they may be the same kind of people you're talking about. B: You know, they've, they've got twelve weeks to do something, B: and they, they're making furniture and just, you know, things like that during the winter B: and then they go off and do other things during the summer. A: Yeah, A: it's a, it's a really, good thing because it's keeping him sane, B: So, yeah, B: Yeah, B: yeah. B: Yeah. A: and plus it's keeping his marriage B: Yeah. A: so, and, and plus he's getting on in his years now. A: He's, he's not that old, A: but he's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost, to, to do something like that. B: Yeah. A: And, uh, it's really, it's, it's, uh, hard work. A: I couldn't imagine taking lumber, raw lumber and trying to make something out of it. A: He He dowels everything. B: That would be really you know, B: like say the, B: Oh, man, B: yeah. A: And it's all got to line up. A: It's, A: and, uh, I don't think he goofs too much, A: I don't to, see too much scrap around. B: Yeah, B: yeah, B: that's, that's something. B: Now our temperatures down here, we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties A: God , I'm envious B: and, uh, so, and, uh, so as far as, you know, planting outdoor stuff, matter of fact, tonight I just got through, I was planting some, some trees out back tonight, B: and, uh, this is, uh, it's really nice, out tonight. A: Is it going to be, Is it going to be really dry? B: Almost hated to come, you know. A: Uh, are you are you, A: now I always plant trees in the fall. A: I don't know why A: so the, the cold weather can kill them B: Yeah, B: these were, uh, trees that, that wintered. A: but I guess, B: I don't know where they came from. B: They come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that. B: And they come down here B: and they'll sit in the nurseries here B: and they'll go ahead and, and, uh, leaf out. B: So what I'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that's, or trees that are already leafed out. A: Oh, that's good. A: I guess they, they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall, all . B: Yeah. B: Mostly, I think in a place where it's really cold they do it in the fall, B: let them winter you know, through the fall, A: Yeah. B: but, uh, down here, well, it's done both ways. B: It, it just kind of depends on what you're, what you're planting, B: but, uh all the shrubs and, A: Yeah, A: and, uh, when you have time to do it B: Yeah. A: My sister does, uh, flower gardens. A: She gets right into it. B: Uh-huh. A: She spends lots of money on them. A: And I guess a lot of people do, do do that. A: They landscape their whole house with flower gardens. B: Yeah . A: She's got like, just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch tree bark all over her lawn B: Yeah. B: Flowers, during the summer down here, the, the normal kind of flowers, there's very few of them that will really do well. B: Everything does real well here in the spring until about, oh, first part of June B: and then the the heat sets in. A: It gets, B: And June, July, August are, you know, B: most of the, those kind of plants just, are just barely staying alive, let alone make flowers. A: Do you have a lot of shade trees around your house A: or is it, B: Uh, we're in a relatively new area. B: We're
