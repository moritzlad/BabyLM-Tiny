this er. Sorry, David Lock. The best way to start on this dis section of this discussion may be to erm express the observation that the county council and at least one of the local authorities which is Harrogate, erm are already engaged in have been engaged in for some time a very positive erm activity to try and attract to the county inward investment predicament that the economic development unit of the county council, the economic development of at of at least the one local authority that I have named and erm prospective developers such I'm representing today, share common predicament, is that the existing structure plan constructs some obstructions, erects some obstructions to the attraction of inward investment into the county. Existing structure plan in short is erm set out in such a way that it pos positively discourages the accommodation of inward investment on a large scale. It is in the shared interest of of the parties I'm describing that this county should be able to attract and accommodate er inward investment of strategic significance to help the people of this county find the due employment that they need. The difficulty we all share is how can one construct a planning framework which allows for strategically significant inward investment to be accommodated without declaring an open season of speculative proposals from developers and uncertainty at the local level up and down the county. As you've seen from the erm discussion paper that we submitted sir, it's our feeling that the most helpful way to proceed might be to add a new policy to the alteration. Or alternatively adapt Policy I five to allow for a strategic erm site or sites to be brought forward by local planning authorities in the course of their local plan work. But clearly some way must be found to prevent the open house that is all our concern to safeguard the amenity and character of the county. Looking through our own experience in other parts of Britain and having read some of the submissions of erm others on this subject, we reached the conclusion that the most helpful thing to do might be to have a policy which was criteria based. And to set criteria for this strategic site exception policy which we feel should be added to the plan, to set this criteria in such a way that it would so point to the local authorities in the making of their local plans but it was clear that the policy did not provide a speculative opportunity for everybody any landowner throughout the county. The criteria that we have suggested in the paper we've put in for for the discussion session stems from detailed observation and experience of what inward investment of the strategically significant kind might be looking for. One of its most distinguished distinctive characteristics is the size of site which we know from experience which the county Harrogate Borough and ourselves at least have already here can be the order of magnitude of fifty hectares. Now almost by definition it's very very unlikely in this county that a site of that size development would be found within a built-up area. But size is the first criteria it seems to me that one should be looking at. On location where what criteria might be used to guide location, I've said it's most unlikely to be found in a built-up area, but clearly close to good communications networks is important and must be within a reasonably short travel time of the national highway network. And I'll volunteer suggested in for me in the paper as a criterion that it also ideally should in my opinion have a the potential for railway connection given the thrust of policy a decade two decades ahead of us. The next issue is that we know that these prospective inward investors are likely to be looking for a site in reasonably attractive setting. This is very difficult because it means er it is a potential threat as it were to the countryside of the county. So we're suggestion criterion which make it quite clear that such a strategic site should not under any circumstances be located in the national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, heritage coast, greenbelt and other specially designated areas of countryside protection. Another characteristic of the inward investors that two authorities and ourselves have had experience of is that it's likely that the user or users will want to have reasonably clean air, good water and the ability to work twenty four hours. Now that again suggests for this strategic type of inward investment a location away from existing built-up areas. On the one hand for environmental reasons, for their environmental reasons I should say, and on the other hand so as not to come as a nuisance to residents of existing communities. Another safeguard that it seems to me that any such policy should have should be that development of the site must be possible without breaching reasonable and appropriate environmental standards. So that in itself it must not create er air pollution or water pollution and so on. And the last aspect of this sir is if you were to erm have a strategic site policy which as I was alluded to in my opening remarks, really is a chance for the planning system to catch up with what is actually happening in this county. An enabling framework at strategic level to allow inward investment to be attracted. If you have such a policy if you were to have criteria of the kind I'm alluded to erm does that still leave it too open in North Yorkshire, might it still be too wide too many erm er opportunities might meet locations might meet these criteria. And on this sir I, the way the discussion's been going over the last couple of days, erm I would like to point you at the experience of the Nottinghamshire structure plan which I've got direct personal experience, where there the panel was persuaded to commend locations that isn't right for structure plan but was a felt able to erm name a district or district council in whose area such a strategic site might be located. And I offer that as a idea for discussion. Policies which no doubt David erm Allenby will explain later of Harrogate would suggest that Harrogate Borough is one in this county that feels it could accommodate a strategic site. There may be others, I'm guessing, presume that er Mr Hesel Mr Heselton is looking as though he might be welcoming of a strategic site given half a chance. The point I'm trying to get at sir is that erm it is none of it is in none of our interests, either the planning authorities or even of the developers, that if we were to erm find a strategic sites policy appropriate for this alteration, it's in none of our interests that it should be confusing to the public or to the development industry as to how rare a thing this should be and how tightly directed it should be in geographical terms. Criteria I've su criteria I've suggested narrows the geography pretty precisely but if you felt the need, the local authorities felt the need, for even further protection it does seem to me from my own experience of the Nottinghamshire precedent it is possible if if you felt so inclined and the county was to agree you could narrow it even further by naming one or two erm local authorities such a site erm should be discovered. Now that sets the general scene sir. What I haven't done and I ought to because of the erm the way that this discussion has to unfold, I ought to say that pure few sentences about why should there be a strategic sites policy at all and erm I ought to put that on the record although it's pretty well trailed in all the paper work. And it it goes like this that the economy of North Yorkshire generally and of some of its districts in particular has reached the point where it is not possible from internally generated growth to provide er the jobs that the residents . It is therefore necessary Q E D for this county to be able to attract if it can some of the footloose investment which is available in Britain and er generally in Europe. To attract that inward investment to provide local jobs it's necessary for North Yorkshire to have one or more sites which are as available and as attractive as competing locations. I've described some of the characteristics in those sites. Now this aspect of competition is inescapable. In a planners ideal world where we might have a wholly directed economy competition would not be relevant but I'm afraid the reality is we have to compete in North Yorkshire with other counties in er this region and with other regions in Britain with other countries in the European Union and with other countries in the world. And what we have found that is the county, Harrogate certainly and ourselves from direct experience this last two years, is that one of the features, we have an attractive county to such inward investors, its its environment, its people, its setting, its air and everything else is good, but one of the features that we have so far been unable to offer is a planning framework which means that the marketing authority can deliver, guarantee delivery of the planning consent that would make it happen. As a result of that inability to guarantee a planning erm approval er this county has this county has lost one major inward investor within the last eighteen months already, referred to by name in the documentation that is Kimberley Clarke. Who were extremely keen to locate in this county, everything was right for them, Mr Allenby's borough had the site, my clients had the site should I say, and erm but we lost it to Humberside because it was not possible for either Harrogate or ourselves to look them in the eye and say yes we can guarantee planning consent. There happens to be another current live inquiry of a Germany car manufacturer. That may be part of some bigger game going on about busting unions in Germany, we're not green about that, but again the same question arises in the interrogation. The people are right, the location is right, the situation is right but can you guarantee planning consent. And under the present present planning framework it is difficult for us to do. So for all those reasons sir there does seem to me to be erm the case for a policy which would allow this exception to erm attract to North Yorkshire inward investment of this strategically important kind. And as I said earlier on is how the key to this is how to construct such a policy that would protect the interests of the county in a general environmental sense, give local authorities the freedom in their local plans to set their stall out if that is what they want to do and er whilst avoiding provoking a rash of speculative developments erm er all over the place. I believe that a criteria based policy might the best way forward for that. Thank you. Thank you. Can I ask you Professor Lock to say a little about what you consider the housing implications of such a policy might be? Yes. And Sorry. a bit more about the the range of employment you would envisage on the sort of fifty hectare site that you've talked about. Do you mean range in terms of numerical quantity or type or all sorts? Er oh all. Please. Certainly. The, I've forgotten what your first question was now . Housing Housing right. The I'm not an economic development officer so the er breadth of the perspective I have is limited from market experience rather than from a broader overview. The market experience is that the inward investors of this scale on the strategic importance that we're discussing generally speaking generate no significant housing demands as part of their package. There may be a handful of key employees brought in by that company to the location to establish the plant erm and to erm recruit and run the work force but my experience of these inquiries and prospective inquiries is that generally speaking they are looking to recruit labour locally and so this is not a housing generator type of development. This is a job supplier type of development. As to the type of employment the interesting feature that I experienced over the last two to three years as shown is that the inquiry level the type of inquiries has tended to focus on manufacturing and the attraction has been the quality of the work force, that is both in skill and its healthiness you know the liability and there are other issues in there too about where Britain is at these days in terms of immunisation wage levels, but it is the people that are themselves the major attractors so the potential work force in the locality that is the major attractor . And that the business has been predominantly the nature of business has been predominantly manufacturing. detect a bit of a question mark and the end of er sorry er er doubting tone as to in my voice that I'm not sure that that would be so in the decade ahead. I I simply don't know but the paperwork I've seen says that erm it is as likely in the next four or five years that major inward investors could be in the B one office type of employment as they happen to have been in the last couple of years in the manufacturing class. It may be you see that the manufacturing flavour of the past two years was to do with the pre er Common Market period getting inside the European Union ring fence with the manufacturing plant and there is speculation as to whether that will now change that the Common Market is now established and that that window of opportunity for manufacturing has tended to recede suggesting that it may be erm administrative er er services service sector that erm these international companies would now want inside the Union. We don't know but I don't know but that is a doubt as to whether the manufacturing flavour of the past will be carried on through the decade. It is also fair to say, and I must be up front about this because it is a matter of it is probably the most sensitive aspect of this whole debate, is about B eight warehousing and distribution. This county is one that for quite a long time has had the policies, I think it's it's E it's number eleven E E eleven is it or I eleven I I I eleven. thank you, in the existing structure plan. There's a there's a established prejudice against warehousing and distribution er developments in this county in the existing structure plan. To be candid with you I would expect there to be, I'm certain, that there will be demand for er modern warehousing and logistic floor space of strategic scale strategic importance er in this county. And I know this presents the county council with some problems I don't know currently what the the local authorities' view on it is. But do let me say a couple of things about it. A subject I happen to know quite a bit about because we've got seven and a half million square feet erm in development at the moment in Lutterworth at Magna Park. Modern warehousing and logistics can yield good job densities. Er modern logistics floor space will at the very least yield about a thousand jobs sorry a hundred jobs per thousand square feet. Er sorry getting all my digits in the wrong place. Try and get it right. It is a hundred jobs per hundred thousand square feet, that's right. And the reason why those job densities work like that is that modern logistics floor space comes brings with it typically an office element unit. So you'll get a big erm warehouse erm which may be typically erm computer controlled, retrieval systems, storage, inventory, stock control and all the rest of it which will employ a certain number of people. But also with it comes erm office accommodation which is handling the clerical processing, ordering and so on of the business itself. And that is a relatively new phenomenon and the type of warehouse which historically we all knew which was men in brown coats driving forklift trucks is not what it's about, it's about er pretty sophisticated labour erm dealing with erm computer systems and electronic retrieval systems and often working in shifts on twenty four hour basis. Now whether we would find in our strate if we were to have a strategic sites policy erm whether there's an issue there that it might let in as it were too much of that kind of land use and not enough of the manufacturing or proper office kind I think is worth kicking around the table. And if it is an issue as to whether there's some way of containing that. But I'll have to be very careful with it I I do expect, I would expect, that there would be inquiries for that kind of investment here erm it's just that we haven't any major ones in the last couple of years of that type because the overall framework here is opposed to it. I suspect the answer to my first question is about numbers of jobs, by virtue of what you've just said as long as a piece of string. Would you like to hazard a guess about how long the string might be? On the number of jobs? Well, if you'll just, if I'm allowed to turn round and consult the chap sitting behind me I can actually give you a direct a direct answer. It's sorry, I'm going to have to do some mathematics because what my friend is telling me it it curious it's it's the thirty four per hectare. Right I've actually I've actually been doing some arithmetic while you were talking Thank you. on the basis of a hundred per hundred thousand square feet to which you'd have to add obviously a sort of surrounding area from the square footage used for a distribution warehouse, it looks as though it's around about the thirteen Yeah. per hectare. Something like that. I'm I'm embarrassed about that because It's alright. the speech we had about job densities yesterday. It obviously wasn't accidental that it worked out that way. Yep. Thank you. Thank you. Can I can I, before we go to Mr Potter, erm may be my slightly naive mind here but I distinguish when you start talking about a strategic site approach to planning for and one of provision within North Yorkshire er as being different from an approach based on major exceptions in that in the sense that you would actually plan for the ability to cope with what my colleague calls the ointment coming over the horizon. In other words, major inward investment not relocation of major investment within the U K but major inward investment from say Western Europe or Japan or wherever. Another Nissan or Toyota. Erm against that there is this elephant which appears, and you say we might have it and find a zoo for it, and in fact we can't move fast enough to find the zoo. Now the the problem with the dealing with I I suspect with the major exceptions policy is that if you had it could you move fast enough in order to cope with that sort of animal appearing on your horizon which you wanted to capture. Surely in a way I'm answering my own point, you would have to go beyond just having a set of words on paper which says we have a major exceptions policy. What do Yes I what do you do in reaction to that? You're looking at Mr Potter do want him I'm just throwing it open. Because I don't think he wanted to be asked question as his first question . Erm it it does like this sir that I would imagine that what what we're after here is a policy which would enable a local authority if it so wished to put into its local plan a strategic site. So that by the time so that when you're out catching elephants you've already got the the the planning story is straight already as part of your net is that I've got a planning Yes. Mr Potter. Erm David Potter North Yorkshire County Council. Er in fact you have anticipated one of the questions I was going to ask. Are we talking here about the principle of major exceptions or are we actually talking about a site. But the reason as it were was to address some of the issues er that Professor Lock has raised. And I think I need to place this issue of inward investment in its proper context in terms of the county council's economic development strategy and the planning strategy for the county. Erm inward investment in terms of the county council's economic development strategy is recognized as important and I think Professor Lock quotes the economic development strategy. I have the strategy in front on me but I it also the strategy also places the economy of the county in in that context in so far as we're dealing with er the county of North Yorkshire is reliant upon some twenty five thousand small businesses employing twenty five people or less and has only forty one firms serving one local market employing over three hundred people. This is an important area of concern obviously. But the basic essence of the strategy focuses on the small firms which underpins the local economy. In ret in terms of inward investment the economic development strategy focuses on inward investment it has a role to play. Er without suitable sites and premises inward investment cannot succeed since inquiries cannot be converted into jobs. And the county council will actively promote key sites to potential inward investors. It will seek to attract further inward investment based upon its strengths and by bioscience. Whilst inward investment Can you can you submit that? I I can certainly. Essentially what it's talking about it inward investment on small scale. Inward investment which could be accommodated within the existing plans existing strategies on existing sites. And in fact at the greenbelt plan inquiry er er I I spent a considerable amount of time arguing on the issue of prestige sites and the availability of prestige sites within the greater York area already planned and available. Er I think the county council recognizes the role of inward investment but that it is a small part of the ec economic growth. In fact the revised economic development strategy which Professor Lock probably doesn't have a copy of, refers to inward inward investment as being desirable erm and is of critical importance but whilst it will be vigorously sort in this way it has to be said that the bulk of North Yorkshire suffers from a relative lack of financial incentives from Central Government in terms of whose regional policy does not have a priority. Even when North Yorkshire sites have been short-listed by an investor on quality grounds the county has had no means of matching the financial incentives elsewhere. And I think the er inward investors that Professor Lock is referring to in terms of the German car manufacturer er the information that we have is that those were the very factors they considered and erm North Yorkshire is not short- listed. Erm we have not perceived that inward investment of this scale is required or that the economic structure of the county could support such a major investment. It is based on small firms. And I look at issues much broader that the sites availability. Availability of labour erm the structure of the labour force. Now in terms of Harrogate for example that is largely focused on erm on the office commercial sector. There is no obviously er pool of manufacturing labour or erm strong manufacturing base sufficient to support a firm coming in and and taking up these large quantities of land. I mean why should this be in there'd be a strategic sites policy. It's it's not necessarily possible to generate jobs from with within its own boundaries. I mean the focus of the plan and the way we've approached erm trying to identify the appropriate level of of land takes into account all that we considered to be the needs of the local economy. And I think this inward investment that Professor Lock is referring to and the scale of investment that he is referring to must be considered as additional and and would draw in additional jobs. I think that's all I I'd like to say on that for the moment. Any one else want to participate in this discussion? Mr Allenby. Thank you Chairman. Er David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council. Erm obviously the borough council strongly advocates the the principle of a strategic exceptions policy and I think there there is some difference between what Professor Lock is advocating and what the borough council is advocating. From a planning point of view we're advocating that there should be a criteria based policy within the structure plan. Er we're not seeking a er a side based initiative if you like as such, although that might come later. So we're looking for a for a separate policy in the industry employment section of the structure plan, we do not wish to see any amendment to part of E two or for that matter to Policy I five, both of which we we fully support. In making a case for for a new exceptions policy our our starting point really is the erm strategic planning framework provided by structure plan, that's Policy I five and the proposed Policy E two. And we feel that both of those policies combine to establish what is in effect a presumption against erm any form of significant employment development away from the the county's main settlements. And I think this is particularly important in the context of the section fifty four A. we've heard from from Professor Lock there are some economic development projects which because of their size or their importance or their locational requirements just can't be accommodated in and around the main settlements of the county. And these developments may be of regional or national importance and they're usually footloose and and clearly would have very significant employment benefits for the local population. And it's these developments that the borough council wishes to see embraced by a new policy. In effect the borough council would like to see a framework established which acknowledges explicitly that in the right circumstances strategic employment development can be accommodated in the county. In our view such developments will only be attracted to an area if there is a clear prospect of of a site being made available as an exception to normal blank policies to meet those very specific requirements. And a key in all of this and Professor Lock er mentioned is why should we have er a strategic exceptions policy, why why do we want to attract those sort of developments to the county and more specifically perhaps Harrogate District? And in that I can only speak for the Harrogate District erm but the situation may well apply to other districts. Yesterday Professor Lock referred to to Harrogate's bubble having burst. Erm indeed over the last two or three years the borough council's become extremely concerned at the deteriorating economic situation within the district and particularly around Harrogate itself. The current in Harrogate's case significant number of major job losses and we we estimate that those amount to between three and four thousand jobs, er many of which we feel are still to come through the system and are therefore not reflected in unemployment figures of yet. The result of all this has been a rapid rise in in registered unemployment er nevertheless and a steep rise in in long term unemployment. And particularly of concern to us an adverse structural shift in various employment sectors. And the borough council has responded to this situation by adopting a number of policy objectives including the one which seeks to attract appropriate inward investment projects. And we feel that in order to facilitate this a planning policy initiative is is needed. We've looked at those initiatives and there seem seemed to me to be to be three approaches. Firstly, the council could have opted for a significant increase in the er I five allocation and to go on to see to identify a site in the local plan. And for a number of reasons we we felt that this wasn't appropriate er primarily because it's it's an inflexible approach. Erm it isn't really tailored to meet the needs er of the sort of developments we're talking about. In effect anything allocated under I five would have to be made available in or in or around main settlements. Secondly we could've or we could accept the status quo and and do what the county council's suggesting. In other words, we would deal with applications as they come forward on an ad hoc basis where the onus onus would be on the developer to prove er prove exceptional circumstances. In our view this is not acceptable either. The main problem here is that that sort of approach wouldn't give potential inward investors any confidence at all that a strategic development would be acceptable within the county or within the district. In other words, uncertainties about the planning posture towards a proposal and doubts about local local authorities' ability to approve a site are likely to deter potential investors at an early stage. The third option is to go for a strategic exceptions policy in the structure plan and obviously this is what er the borough considered considers is appropriate. We feel that this would provide a framework for the evaluation of the material considerations which the county council has accepted can come into play. And it appears from what the county council has said that they are they're not necessarily opposed to this sort of development that we're we're looking at here but that er the case would have to be proven as an exception to normal planning policy. All we're seeking is some explicit acknowledgement within the plan that there may be circumstances where this type of development will be appropriate. The type of policy we're actually seeking is already included in the Humberside structure plan and I see this morning that er that was circulated as D four double O seven. Er in fact it is actually erm er re reproduced in my my evidence, paragraph four and five. Now that policy and I think think I'll it out, The proposals for industry and commerce that are not in accordance with the relevant policies of this plan would not normally be permitted but special provision for very large projects may occasionally be made in exceptional circumstances provided that, and there are three criteria, There would be substantial proven employment or other benefits to county residents, the proposal cannot reasonably be implemented on land proposed in local plans for industrial or commercial development bearing in mind the undertakings operational requirements, and thirdly, that there are no overriding planning objections. Now that seems to us to be a very good way forward in establishing a framework for for the consideration of those sort of proposals. It's clear from from that sort of policy that the need for or benefits arising from the development would always have to be assessed against environmental and other considerations, for example, regional strategy. Which is what the county council suggests could happen anyway. In this case however there would be a proper framework for for that evaluation to take place. To conclude therefore the borough council strongly urges the panel to recommend the county council to include a strategic exceptions policy. Before I finish I I just wonder whether I could put one point to the county and that's whether in the absence of a strategic exceptions policy in the structure plan, they would allow the borough council to include the type of policy we're seeking in our district wide local plan bearing in mind that some of the considerations in involved are of a strategic nature. Before you before you respond Mr Williamson, Mr Heselton do you want to just pick up the Thank you sir. same sort of feel that Mr Allenby's been dealing with? Yeah. Terry Heselton Selby District. Erm I'm in I'm in some difficulty because this is this is a matter that's arisen since the original matters er matters for discussion were drawn up so I'm not able to give you the formal views of the council in that respect. But it it might be worth if if I outline my own office view Well let me have your professional view. Right well yes that's what I was about to do. Erm well as I've as I've in my submission I I think we can give qualified support for the proposal that erm Harrogate have put on the table. I'll come as no surprise to you that er what's been suggested would be consistent with the sorts of arguments that that I put forward yesterday. Erm going back to to my point that the existing development plan system hasn't served Selby District particularly well. And picking up Professor Lock's point erm we are certainly in the market to attract footloose investment. Erm interesting that that Dave Allenby's men mentioned the Humberside policy and again just just to reiterate very briefly the the point I made yesterday. We had some discussion about competition, if I can use that word, between ourselves and and Leeds, but where Selby sits in in North Yorkshire we are in competition with with more than just West Yorkshire. We've got the South Yorkshire authorities Wakefield and Doncaster in particular and also the the Humberside authorities as as well. So I think it it would fit in with the the council's a adopted economic development strategy. I think basically having having heard the argument put forward from from both sides what what we're really talking about is a is a policy that in in terms of its support from the districts it depends whether or not any particular district council might have such a use for the policy. And and I think I I'm able to to to give that level of support from Selby District's point of view. Two concerns that that I do have are one in in relation to the er criterion and the safeguards that might also be be put in place with the policy. And er got three suggestions really to add to the criteria that Professor Lock's put forward. One is that I think in order to overcome some of the objections that that we heard from Leeds yesterday in terms of the erm the urban regeneration policies, that any proposal would would certainly need to be re-relocating from outside the region. Erm secondly, it might reasonably be expected to demonstrate that it would be in the interests of either the region, regional or sub- regional economy. Then that thirdly, it it would need to help fulfil the economic objectives or the employment needs of the receiving authority which which I guess in in many respects boils down to nominating a particular authority or authorities if if you like. Erm where I have to qualify my my support is is, and and I do particularly want to stress that in no way would I accept the exceptions policy as a substitute to an appropriate increase in the employment alloca allocation for Selby District. Because clearly an increase in in in the allocation sends a much stronger signal to potential investors and it carries with it a greater degree of certainty as far as the district council's concerned, as far as potential investors are concerned. And also of course as a far as local people are concerned. The implication So sorry can I just ask, so in effect you haven't shifted your ground from the view which you expressed in paragraph three point six of your submission where you've just confirmed in fact that you'd rather have a proper or the ability to make a sort of proper measured allocations, part of which would make provision or allow the facility to cater for major inward investment? Er Terry Heselton Selby District. Well,another way of putting it is that this might be an additional er policy that that would help us as well as er Yep. as an increase in the all in the allocation, but that the main message is is that I wouldn't like it to be a substitute for that. No right. Thank you. Is the implication of what you've just said to the Chairman that you agree with Mr Allenby that this animal is a different one than anything that might go to an I five site? Terry Heselton Selby District. Yes I think I think that that that is the case. But but equally it may it may be in the in the fullness of time that that we would be able to identify or bring a site forward through the local plan process and we're not at that stage at the moment. Right. I have some knowledge of the Lutterworth site to which Professor Lock referred and of the Toyota site at Derby. Professor Lock will no doubt correct me if I'm wrong but from memory in neither of those cases was there the sort of provision in the development plan which you're now seeking. It may be, but I can't remember, that both of them preceded section fifty four A. Was that true at Lutterworth? I'm I'm not competent on, er David Lock, I'm not competent on Toyota. Erm all I have is the layman's knowledge that it was a gift to Edwina Curry's constituency . Er erm and I don't think it had a planning history. The the erm situation for Lutterworth er Magna Park however I I am familiar with and it certainly preceded section fifty four A and erm in in there were two phases. Er the first of erm er three three million square feet, second of four and a half, and erm the er in both cases it triggered the call-in procedure under the departure and in both cases er a public inquiry had to be held er or the Secretary of State chose to call a public inquiry. And in both cases that took two and a half years. But hasn't prevented either. It hasn't prevented either Going ahead. No but the the, sorry you're quite right. Erm the difference is that erm it A Magna Park is specifically an exclusively rather, exclusively geared to to B eight and is absolutely slap bang in the middle of the country on the conjunction of the M six M one and the A one M link route and everything else. Erm the land is a disused airfield required very cheaply so there was no great exposure in getting that site away and its first occupiers were the company that had bought it and Asda did their own buildings to begin with for their own use. What we're talking about here is a is a different circumstance where the erm competition for inward investment up here further north is more intense. A number of erm elephants coming into view is fewer. There are fewer elephants about up here erm and er the issue that obviously concerns me from the development point of view is the is the time scale, is the process rather, that that the planning policy would im would imply. And sorry, while I'm speaking I'm I'm left a little confused. When you heard me I was imagining a process whereby you'd have a strategic sites policy in the structure plan which would enable a local authority in preparing its local plan if it wished to identify a strategic site and that would then become in the local plan, you know subject to all those consultation processes, and then it's part of the portfolio that is available in the published arena with a statutory framework behind it. Erm David Allenby didn't talk like that. We haven't swapped notes on this aspect of it. He maybe sees a different process and and I don't know about you Chairman but it would it would help me to see if to hear whether they they see a different process at work. David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council. Erm my starting point on all of that is the development issues report that erm we put to our members in May of this year where we discussed the issue of strategic exceptions policies and how we would deal with with that sort of approach in in the local plan. And the conclusion of that is we go for a criteria based approach for the time being, see see what the response was to that er and nothing was said about identifying the site as such. I think the difficulty with taking a a site approach is that it's difficult erm to assess what the employment benefits are of something that you're not sure about. Erm now it may be that on a particular site erm conditions could be laid down to ensure and secure that there were significant employment benefits accruing from the development of that site. But what we had in mind in looking at this through the the local plan was that er we'd be looking at specific end users to see what the benefits were of those those end users and to assess those benefits against any environmental harm that there would be and strategy as a whole. So I think erm there is there is a difference between us in all of that, but that needn't necessarily mean that we won't identify a site in the future. Can I take it from what you said Professor Lock that you would envisage this policy as providing for B one B two and B eight development? Yes. yes that it would e it would exclude none of those possibilities is how I would Given the stance of policy approved Policy I eleven in relation to B eight development and the fact that we are here discussing an alteration not a review and replacement of the structure plan, does anyone around the table she said looking hard at Mr Saunders, see any difficulty in the panel poten potentially recommending a policy which would be in direct wi conflict with the policy which is not before it? Les Saunders Department of the Environment. Since the department since the regional office has been suggesting for some time, or throughout the entire process of this structure plan alteration, that erm an exceptions policy should be considered by the erm county council, I think it would be consistent that we would anticipate the panel could reach a conclusion on the inclusion of the major exceptions policy as part of this alteration. Was the regional office conscious in making that, I'm sorry that was not that pause intentional, was the regional office conscious in making that suggestion that B eight uses were being advocated to be included and therefore the conflict potentially was a policy which was not before it? I think that's a fair point. I think that B eight was not upper most in the department's mind when it was making its er views known about a major exceptions policy. Thank you sir. So if the panel were minded to recommend an exceptions policy then in the in the light of I eleven we we'd have great difficulty in recommending other than B one and B two uses. Perhaps er my understanding was as as I guess Mr Saunders' understanding of this policy was before Professor Lock mentioned Lutterworth, that it was primarily manufacturing or B one, B one or B two. This is this is now a now a terribly important issue. I it is not envisaged I mean I mustn't mislead you at all I want I want to be understood on this issue. Nobody is that I'm that I'm aware, is proposing a distribution park of strategic importance . Yet. Yet. Erm what I was trying to do was be candid about what kind of er inquiries of the strategic kind might be expected to come if this county had that kind of policy. I think what I imagined erm Miss Whittaker and Chairman is that erm if you get the criteria right then this exceptions policy would also be an exception to I eleven, but it would have to pass this criteria. In other words it would have to be job beneficial, it would have to be of strategic importance and and all those other things we've been discussing. But I think I had imagined it would it would allow, if it was wanted, it would allow I eleven to be overridden it would be one of the things it would be an exception to. I think potentially Professor Lock you could be inventing some work for barristers given that Policy I eleven says provision will not be made. It does doesn't it? But then if we're exempting ex exceptions policy except as maybe provided an exception policy number seven . . I can I can see the the trap here. Erm it maybe that in this alteration the erm it's worth just spending a minute on whether B eight should just be kept out of the frame for the moment and it's something that gets dealt with at a later time when more policies are in play. Can I ask would that seriously if it were limited or by virtue of the panel report having identified this problem we reported that we saw a problem if it included B eight, would that be a problem from the point of view either Harrogate or Selby if B eight was in effect, if not in the policy itself, excluded? David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council. Erm perhaps I could answer that Chairman by saying that the policy I've suggested from the Humberside structure plan would er would I think cover that er problem in that it starts off by saying, Proposals for industry and commerce that are not in accordance with the relevant policies of this plan will not normally be permitted. And then put special provision for very large projects. So there is a recognition there that by the very nature of these erm proposals that they're not going to be in accordance with one or perhaps more policies in the structure plan. Thank you. Thank you sir. Er Terry Heselton Selby District. Erm I don't think it would would cause us a a tremendous problem. Erm can I also draw your attention to the to the second erm part of the of the policy that would at least permit that type of development provided it it was able to demonstrate a need to be located in North Yorkshire. So it's not an absolute exclusion is it? You're talking about I eleven? I eleven sorry yes. Yes it's not it's not absolutely exclusive. Mr Broughton. Thank you Chairman. As I said this morning doesn't oppose er in principle the idea of of of er an exceptions policy. But er looking at er Professor Lock's suggestion and the criterion that is set out there I think er a number of people might be interested to have a go at those criteria so to speak. And certainly from erm my department's point of view we would be looking for er an inclusion of a criterion on the need to avoid higher quality agricultural land. That's it. Mr Earle and then Mr Potter. Thank you Chairman. Patrick Earle Richmondshire. I also speak with a, a while ago now, but a certain amount of experience in Northumberland working for the county council in bringing development into Cramlington new town, so I am aware of the er the merits of er getting your elephants by having a cage already made. Find some of them insist on finding their own cage and er so you do then have to er have a flexible approach. But I think the analogy begins to break down and I'll go on to erm straight forward thinking in Richmondshire erm where we wouldn't recognize an elephant if we saw one. . I've just been told er to my right it's a very large sheep. Erm . Shame. No. The scale of development that's in Professor Lock's contemplation is plainly not one that I I think that would directly er affect Richmondshire and so to some extent er I'm speaking from that perspective. Although fifty hectares at thirty per hectare I mean fifteen hundred jobs erm and I think we've got eleven hundred or a thousand on our total unemployment role. So plainly that wouldn't necessarily apply to us but the the except the exception would be sitting there in policy and I I think it's a it's something we we would find very difficult er to live with. Erm you see the question is how far how wide to the exceptions go. Er Mr Broughton's just brought in another one that he he wants er qualification on. How how many other policies of the structure plan would this apply to? Wild life conservation, er and other conservation issues er would be brought into question. Erm I I foresee the possibility that erm we would be faced with lesser proposals lesser than the scale that erm Professor Lock contemplates because it would be said, well if fifty hectares is right for Ha er for Harrogate then what twenty hectares for Richmondshire ten hectares. Er and and and so the the the policy would perhaps be extended. Erm the the question would ultimately come out, well why not retail? I I the retail's not within what we've been talking about this afternoon but on the other hand it does employ more people per hectare than any industry we've been talking about as as far as as far as I understand it. I see a danger that every single motorway interchange in the county, and heavens in the country, will be subject to an interpretation of this er of this sort of exceptions approach. And it's that in itself has been er er an issue faced by Ministers on the M twenty five. Erm the the er Professor Lock was saying well you know the way you get your footloose industry is to present them with an absolute guarantee of planning permission. Well no ideas have been put forward this afternoon in terms of a structure plan alteration er or an additional policy, will give an absolute guarantee. I mean obviously the it's a I perhaps it's an exaggeration to the effect that nobody can guarantee planning permission until they've got planning permission. And this is why I think the approach that Harrogate would perhaps be thinking of and we ourselves would be thinking of if this is the way we wanted to go is simply to go out and get a site and get planning permission on it. And present it to a prospective developer. Erm or short of that a firm local plan allocation with all the consultations and environmental impact study already done. Other other than that you cannot guarantee planning permission. And what our colleagues in County Durham again in Northumberland we were able to do is was this was all in place. Here's the planning permission here's the site if you insist on going there well we can't give you any guarantees but we'll do our best for you, but certainly the best thing is to have the allocation. And if that allocation is pushed through, if you like in the teeth of the structure plan policy, but it becomes your local plan, and that's the legislation provides for that, that surely must be the the question. Just one other other point, there is the issue of sustainable development Professor Lock referred to erm alright we'll bring in the railway line er as as part of your criteria, but I am concerned at the the general dispersal that is er envisaged in the sort of development er that he suggested. Erm so as I say to to get your erm to get the elephant er have the cage with planning permission. Thank you. Mr Potter. Thank you. David Potter North Yorkshire County Council. Erm I think Professor Lock appears to be talking about a site specific proposal. The borough council refers to a criteria based policy. Yet I think the borough council gave some clear hints they're maybe looking for additional land allocation. Now I think it would be helpful if the borough council could clarify whether that is in fact what they're looking for an additional land allocation. But I would like to point out the county council point of view on both a site or a criteria based policy. In fact er Professor Lock in his hin in his own evidence er page five para four three refers to a rash of speculation alo along the A one M in the county, as to which locations the policy might be said to apply. I think that is the fear of the county council that a criteria based policy would lead to a sp a rash of speculation speculative development along the er the major motorway corridors. Erm with regard to a site specific policy, if it's additional, and there's no clear need for it it's not catered for within the allocation which is er provided for within the structure plan, then we could be left with a major site with a clear commitment to its development or its suitability for development and and no end user. Now what would happen to the site in those circumstances? A major business park, er a major manufacturer, a major distribution centre, erm with the consequences for perhaps in commuting and trans er transport movements. I think these are the fears of the county council that er the uncertainty such a policy would bring. Would the more explicit specification in a policy like E four of Humberside, excuse me, that the development should not be speculative, in other words that the end user should be known, overcome some of your concerns? I think if the end user was known then the end user is perfectly capable of submitting a planning application. Erm and it could be dealt with on its merits. I don't think there's anything within fifty four section fifty four A which precludes that. David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council. I just wanted to come back on er David Potter's assertion that we were looking for a a higher allocation under I five and I I thought I'd specifically covered that point by saying that that wasn't what we were looking for because that wouldn't address the sort of development we're talking about here. Er another allocation under I five would simply mean that we'd more land to find in and around main areas. Erm those sites are subject to other lo locational restrictions and other environmental restrictions and wouldn't in our view be appropriate for the sort of development that he's looking for erm a location in in our context anyway generally speaking along the A one corridor. Could I just have Mr Jewitt first. Michael Jewitt Hambleton District Council. Erm I tend to share Patrick Earle's reservations about this particular policy, I think that it would convey the wrong message erm to the development industry. Erm undermine the policies of conservation and restraint in the county. There's also a danger, as Patrick Earle's pointed out, though it would be applied differently between different districts erm given erm that erm erm relative issues on unem unemployment and the economy will er differ between between districts. I question really whether or not this erm this policy is needed erm to meet local employment requirements. I think it should be erm local councils should be able to bring their requirements from allocated sites provided they make the appropriate er provide an appropriate choice of location and size of sites erm up to the erm levels proposed in the county. And I really do question whether the potential benefits of such such an exceptions policy really erm are worth undermining those strategic policies of conservation and restraint. I tend to think that it should really be left outside the development plan process and it should be for individual developers to prove exceptional needs. That way it can be dealt with through the departure process and the checks and balances the departure er introduces erm are in place erm to to protect local interest. Do you want to come back on something or can I ask Professor Lock to Well it was really er, Ken Williamson of North Yorkshire. It was really er the point er Mr Allenby made. It seems to me that what we're talking about here is Harrogate's land allocation being, not necessarily an I five, but sixty hectares which he agreed was adequate for I five yesterday, plus I suspect another fifty which would be a strategic site. Although there may be differences between er Professor Lock's approach and Harrogate's superficially I think the the mutual objective seems to be er between the two strategic site within the development plan in Harrogate district and on the access one site of the A one A fifty nine junction. Could I check out I I mean I'm still not sure whether Harrogate are happy with sixty hectares at I five to meet their requirements, that was what I understood yesterday. Are we talking about another fifty hectares really to add on to that? Not necessarily as I five but as another fifty hectares as industrial or employment land whatever you'd like to call it. David Allenby Harrogate Borough Council. I'm not sure how clearly I have to spell this out. No we're not looking for an increase in our I five allocation. That is not going to help in this situation. We support the I five allocation. What we're looking for is a new policy initiative which will allow in appropriate circumstances inward investment of er er a significant strategic nature to be accommodated within North Yorkshire and that could possibly probably be Harrogate district. Thank you. Professor Lock. Sir. Erm er four or five points. Er the contribution to the discussion made by Mr Jewitt of Hambleton erm is a necessary contribution but it really doesn't fit or sit well with the economic circumstances of other parts of the county. I don't know about Hambleton but erm talking in er erm on high ground about conservation and so on erm is very difficult when a local authority is faced with structural change in its economic base and major unemployment. I mean that is a serious social and political issue to which there should be in my submission a planning response. We can't just ignore it erm it is proper planning to try and do something about it. way? The relations between teachers and the parents and the school governs and the Local Education Authority. And this one is a very interesting project because it's being done under the director of, direction of Dr. Michael Eraut in the University, but it involves not merely the University but the East Sussex County Council. We are actually partners with the Local Authority on erm this research project. And we've had a great deal of helpful cooperation and it's very much erm going right into the schools, right into the whole system of government and control of the schools, erm and I think again is going to produce some very interesting results before too long. We've a third big project going at the moment, a very tricky one. erm The Schools Council, erm as you may remember, has been putting millions of pounds into educational research over the last dozen years, and all kinds of new curriculum ideas and patterns of organisation have emerged. erm Professor Lacey, a colleague who is at the moment erm the research advisor of the Schools Council, has a project based here which is looking at the impact erm of these Schools Councils projects over the years, which ones have made an impact, which have fallen away, why some have succeeded, why others have fallen off. And we are in fact looking at these projects to see that there is, or if there is, good, not merely ordinary value for money, but good educational value for money, and what might be learnt for the future. These, as Norman Mackenzie has said, are major projects in educational research. And we shall be talking about them in detail in coming programmes. But there are many other interesting studies going on, concerned with all aspects and at all levels of education. Stephen Ball has been investigating the differences between streamed and mixed ability classes in comprehensives. Again, we shall be hearing about his conclusions in another programme. But this is what he had to say about one of the side effects that he noted. It seemed that the pupils in the mixed ability classes developed more slowly socially than the pupils in the streamed classes. This was manifested in a number of ways, particularly in that pupils still in their second year in the mixed ability classes would be talking about playing with their friends, and generally their attitudes towards the teenage culture of pop music and magazines and fashions and discotheques didn't seem to develop so quickly as it had in the streamed situation. And I think really this comes from the problem of those pupils in the streamed situation, in the bottoms streams in particular, who found that they wanted alternatives to school, when the, they were in an inferior position in the school, they were devalued if you like by finding themselves in the bottom streams, and so they tended to look for out-of-school things, alternatives to school, from which to gain their satisfactions, and they would look to the pop media, to fashion, to football, to these kinds of things, and in the mixed ability situation this certainly did not happen in the same way. So the, the children in a sense remained children longer in the mixed ability situation, and again this was something that the teachers found, found very pleasing, in that the, the pupils were remaining involved in the school much more and much longer. Carol Dyhouse has made a special study of women and education. She will be taking part in a programme on this subject on March the twenty-ninth. But as a preview, this was her reply when I asked her whether the problem was, not whether women needed more education, but that men needed educating about women. Men, perhaps, should be encouraged to realise that women want to speak up for themselves, they don't really like being told what they want by men. It's difficult, though, because if you talk to adolescent boys in schools they're violently opposed to women's liberation, they hate the name women's liberation, because they're very defensive perhaps about their own masculinity at that age, and their own masculinity is defined very much in terms of being superior to girls and having mums who wait on them at home. So it's difficult to challenge that kind of supposition at that age. Later on, it's easier. Boys need to be discouraged from assuming that they know what women's position is. I think it's, it really begins in the home, this, because mothers can do quite a lot in not educating their own sons to think of them as servants. A lot of women do this, they're very tolerant about boys' mess in the home and untidiness generally, and in a sense they, they lay the foundations, right from the very beginning, of boys' growing up to think of women as kind of household servants. This attitude, you know, boys will be boys and they make a mess and poor Mum has to do all the washing, is really quite, quite misguided because it, it does encourage those assumptions that mothers are there to tidy up after sons, and of course then sons when they grow up and get wives want to replace their mothers. So women themselves can do something about educating men in the home, starting with their sons. Talking to members of the Education Area about their researches, I was struck by the constructive relationships that they built up with the schools and groups that they studied. Many of the projects arose not just because they seemed to be suitable topics for academic research, but at the direct instigation of teachers or sometimes students. The roles of the researcher were seen in terms of helping to identify, study, and solve an educational problem, with the fullest collaboration. The premium was on being involved as a partner, or as an invited guest, rather than remaining as a detached outsider. Michael Eraut is concerned with evaluation in education, and had this to say. In my mind, the object of doing an evaluation is to create some kind of improvement in the situation that is being evaluated. I'm not interested in producing reports and publications out of evaluation studies, I'm interested in affecting the situation, and affecting it to the mutual satisfaction of the people involved in it. When I'm working with people on an evaluation or discussing evaluation in general, one of the major items of discussion always is, how can you consult other people, how can you get them involved? I say to them, ‘Look, don't start planning this whole thing on your own from the beginning. Go round and talk to the various people you know that are interested and say to them ‘Look, I'm planning to try and do this work, but I don't just want to do this on my own, I want to take into account other people's views.’ For example if I'm looking at O-level history, ‘What sorts of things do you think might be important, or what kinds of evidence do you think I ought to collect, or what issues do you think I ought to take into account?’’ So one tries to build up a kind of agenda of all the things that different people involved think might be important, before one tries to produce a plan as to how one's going to, to work. If people aren't interested in, in evaluation of something that concerns them, then nothing will happen at the end of it. I mean there's no earthly use doing a beautiful piece of evaluation erm which no one wants to know about, and publishing something that has no effect. We've heard about the Education Area, but there is one very important unit that works largely in the wider community, and that is the Centre for Continuing Education. I asked Professor Manny Eppell to describe the Centre's activities. What we try to do is to make available to people opportunities for study in depth and over a fairly long period of time, on issues and in subjects which are part of University activity. Now it could be said of course that we don't offer the same kind of very intense opportunities that are on offer to undergraduates, but in some senses, and many adults have testified to this, this is an advantage, because it enables people in their own time, and sometimes over a fairly prolonged period, to explore with a tutor, a scholar, the kind of interests that they have in the issues that have concerned them in society. It also provides an opportunity, and I think this is quite important, for people to get to know what is happening within the fields of expertise, which increasingly in our society become more and more specialised, more and more hedged off from one another, and in a sense I think that there is a very great danger if intelligent adults in the community, laymen in effect, don't have some idea, some coherent idea, of what's going on in these fields of specialisation and expertise. Now I'm sure you, Brian, would acknowledge that in a certain sense we are all laymen most of the time. However expert we may be in a fairly narrow field we are laymen to one another. I'm a layman to you and you're a layman to me in many senses, and therefore erm the, the, the fact that our students are in effect very often laymen is not something that detracts from their motivation to study, in many instances it's something that gives it stimulus and underlines it. There's another aspect to what we do, and that is that I think we are part of a very powerful developing movement in education, and it is based on the concept that education should not stop with the terminal rituals of school and college, and that education should be as much part of life, wanting to know, to find out, to get to grips with the body of information and knowledge that's available in society. And in a relatively small way, but when you think of the other universities doing the same sort of thing, in a larger way, we are offering this kind of opportunity to people. I think there's one other thing that's worth thinking about, and that is that many of our students come into the University for one-day schools, for lectures, for activities of this kind, and this gives an opportunity for a kind of reciprocal traffic, if you like, so that people outside who often have very odd ideas of what universities do and what they're about and what they're like, can actually see your University, participate in its activities, and we can see ordinary folk who sometimes ask the shrewdest questions and make sometimes what seem to be the most penetrating kinds of points about the sort of things that we take for granted. Many of my tutors have said that one of the most salutary of their experiences has been to work with a good adult class, which starts with no preconceptions, doesn't necessarily have a qualification in mind, and ask the kind of questions which would tend to be asked say in Swift's Gulliver Travels. What, what appear to be, as I said, naive questions very often are most penetrating and bring us up short because they involve things we've taken for granted for many, many years and perhaps ought to look at again. Could you give me an idea as to the size of the community which the Centre of Continuing Education covers, and also the number of courses and the students involved? That community, for historical reasons, happens at the moment to be East Sussex, the whole of East Sussex including Brighton, Eastbourne, Hastings and so on, and a substantial slice of West Sussex, so that our open community courses are available in these areas. The bulk of them, incidentally, are not in the University, some are, but they are in places that students can get to after their work, or easily from their families and their towns and villages throughout the, the county. In what way did furnishing change during the fifties? Apart from the fact that I think most people were able to afford a far bigger range of furnishings, for instance, the number of homes that actually had a carpet in the living room, there was very small percentage of people who could afford to have any sort of carpeting except for a small square of something in their living room. By the mid-sixties, you see, a large proportion of homes would have got fitted carpeting throughout, so there's that kind of difference. There's also the introduction of actual new pieces of furniture, like the coffee table, which you don't find in pre-war homes except in very élite, grand houses, but this is almost a, a standard fitting in a living room now. Can you think of any reason why the coffee table should have suddenly become so popular? Well, I think it's, it's largely to do with the changed uses of the living room, because I think one of the, one of the changes that I found in, in the way that people organise the rooms within their house, is changing over from having a best parlour, usually in the front, which was very seldom used except for inviting the vicar in or whatever, or laying out the dead, combined with a back kitchen, a family room, where you ate and so on, and a move over to having one combined living-dining room where all the family's activities went on. And I think tied in with this is people inviting people into their homes more. Also of course changes in actual eating habits. I think we tend to eat much faster, if you like, and, and to take more snacks, and I think it's interesting that the rise of the use of a coffee table ties in a lot with the rise of people having televisions in their front rooms, because introducing the television made all kinds of changes into, just the way people arrange their chairs, not centring them round the fire any more, and a coffee table's a very neat addition to that kind of arrangement. To what extent do you extrapolate from looking at furnishings to social conditions? I think it's very hard to separate the two, but it's a big chicken and egg, to say which came first, the social conditions or the furnishings is erm is very hard to say, but they are, I mean like in that example that I just gave, they're very strongly tied up. Social conditions certainly affected Mrs. Daisy Sawyer's choice of furnishing. She remembers setting up her first home, right after the war. They were dockets that we had, after the war, to buy our furniture, because there wasn't much furniture around, we was only allowed so many per family. And once you spent those dockets, you just had to go and buy secondhand if you wanted any more. There's quite a few around us because then we was not going onto a council estate from the one room, and we were all in the same boat together. We was all having a hard time, a rough time, and doing what we could to make our homes look respectable and nice for people to come into. Helen, could you call this kind of personal recollection about furnishings a type of alternative history, perhaps like oral history? Yes, because this is describing, analysing how ordinary people lived, what was going on that enabled them to live in this way. Yes, it's a kind of history that history books are not usually written about. When you walk into a living room, what sort of clues do you get? I get clues as to how a particular family organises its life, whether the room is a room for the whole family or a, a room that's perhaps excludes children or a room that's for best, that kind of which not only tells you something about that particular family but, when you've seen enough homes, tells you about general patterns that are going on in social life. Do you find it easy to deduce class from looking at a living room? No, I wouldn't say I did, and I wouldn't say that's what I was looking for, particularly, because again I mean it's a much abused notion that perhaps that class disappears in postwar Britain, I think that's a political issue that was an attempt to make it look as if class was disappearing, class differences rather, but I think there is a lot of evening out, there's not the stark differences of the quality of life of furnishings that you would have found say in homes before the war. Where do you do your research? Well, part of it I've done in the Kent Town, East Brighton area. Particularly in the streets that have undergone a great deal of change since the war, like the street where I live myself, which is another thing that prompted me to, to go into the research in the first place, which is erm a house of small Victorian erm I believe the estate agents call them artisans' cottages , and this kind of area which, there's a great deal of this sort of property in Brighton, has undergone enormous changes since the war from being multi-occupied before the war, with one family on each floor, were regarded immediately after the war as slums and were scheduled for demolition, but they've been a great lease of life all over the country, this sort of property, and been subjected to a process which has come to be known as gentrification, which has meant that when the middle class couldn't afford to, to buy semi-detached in suburbs they took to buying this kind of smaller property in town centres, thereby introducing a whole new element into streets that had never seen these, this kind of things done to houses before. Are people generally willing to let you into their houses? It varies a great deal. I think older people are quite naturally rather anxious, and they're also rather puzzled as to why people should be interested in what their homes were like, now or twenty years ago. But on the whole once I've got talking it's been very successful, and people are always amazed at what they do remember in great detail about how they got things, why they got them, when they got them, and I think by and large the people that I have talked to have found it very interesting to do for themselves as well as for me. Generally what reasons did people give for choosing furniture? An enormous variety of reasons, and by and large not the sort of reasons that advertisers would hope that they did give. I think again the sort of picture that you get from books is rather like a stage set, with everything new from the year nineteen fifty-eight or whatever, all bundled into a room together, this is what it looked like. Well, of course, real homes don't look like that at all and the way that their things are accumulated is not like that. erm A lot of people gave as a reason for getting a particular piece of furniture the fact that it was given to them by their parents when they got married, or that a neighbour was trying to get rid of it, or that somebody from work had passed it on and they needed one. When it came to new furnishings, people usually they found it difficult to say why apart from‘I got it because I liked it’, or ‘I got it because it was cheap’. Who in the homes made the furnishing decisions? Well this provided some very interesting information I think, because I was very surprised the degree to which men were involved in decisions about what to put in the home and had very strong opinions about quite small details of colour and this kind of thing as to what went into the home. But there did seem to be some pattern by which certain objects were very much considered the wife's province. I mean I didn't find any husbands going out and choosing lampshades, for instance, or they weren't particularly bothered about the colour of curtains. It's the kind of objects that get changed more frequently, and particularly those to do with colour, were mainly the wife's decisions. But obviously the heavier pieces of furniture, the more durable ones, are also the more expensive, and when it's largely the money for them's going to come out of the husband's pocket they're going to have more of a stake in erm in saying what they want. And the kind of criticisms split down the middle, as well,on furnishings, that by and large men were far more concerned about the, the lack of durability in modern furnishings compared with their parents', whereas women weren't so concerned with that. Generally, have you discovered any particular changes in Brighton's home furnishing over the past generation? Yes, I'd say there was a definite move towards the same kinds of objects, the same kinds of styles and qualities of furniture being found in a wide variety of income groups, areas of the town, different types of houses, a much more over-all feel, really, a move towards classlessness I suppose you could call it. The fact that a very similar kind of furniture can be bought in an enormous variety of different places, there's not this same idea that ‘Oh, I wouldn't ever go in that sort of shop to buy it because it's not a place for my sort of person’. In addition to becoming less class-distinct, homes generally got more comfortable as well, didn't they? Yes, I think one of the main things that, that made this possible was the improvements in heating. Heating for instance in more than just one room, which for instance became standard in council house building in the late forties onwards. The move towards much more efficient methods of heating like convector heaters right on through to central heating, so that you could use more just that back parlour where the cooker was that kept the place warm. For instance bedrooms, much more use of bedrooms for actually living, particularly for children, although I think that is one of the few instances where you can discover class patterns if you like. That in lower income groups, not because you couldn't afford to heat the bedrooms, but there's a definite idea that bedrooms are for sleeping in, rather than living in. What direction do you see your research taking you in? Well it's hard to know where to stop, really erm I mean the, the difficulty of concentrating on one area of the country, is that we're of course I think there must be very great differences in different areas of the country. Thank very much to Helen Martin and Mrs. Daisy Sawyer. Next week on Ideas in Action we'll pay a visit to the Brighton Youth Orchestra, and take you back in this first talk about the art of film erm to the very early days, and these are difficult I think for us to imagine because we're so used today to sound films, of all the effects in, in the theatres, we're used to the great stars, we're used to the big subjects, and yet the film began in the smallest possible way, it began really as a sideshow, it began as a hobby for a group of people, sometimes they would be French, sometimes they would be British, sometimes American, the early pioneers, whose main interest was to produce a camera, which would look like a still camera and yet somehow would manage to produce a picture which moved when it was projected on a screen. So the first people who made films, the first people who invented the apparatus by means of which they could be made, were relatively simple showmen or photographers, or in certain cases like Edison, erm the, you know a professional inventor, who would use either his staff to develop a piece of apparatus, or would do it himself. And this is really why the beginning of cinema is an international thing. Because now one man, now another would produce some part of what became in the end the motion picture camera. Now you may say ‘Why on earth talk about this sort of thing on Brighton Radio?’ Well, there's a very good reason for this because as it happens erm Brighton was a filmmaking centre in the very earliest days. erm There was one particularly noted filmmaker, a man called George Albert Smith, who worked in Brighton, but there were others too, there was a man called John Bennett Stanford and another called Esmé Collings. And Brighton, strange as it may seem, became, in Britain, one of the small pioneer centres where these first movies were made. Now one has to get this picture into some sort of perspective against, as I said, the big films of today. These men, all of them, were people who first of all were devoted to their cameras. Some of them actually made their own cameras, and even more strangely, used the cameras to project the films after they had made them. In the daytime they would shoot erm with their apparatus, the short strips of film, in say the streets of the towns where they were, and then in the evening they would use the same apparatus adapted to project the films onto a screen. And the kind of thing they made of course erm were just short moments of motion, short silent films which showed action which lasted about a minute. It might be a scene in the High Street, or it might be some particular local personality who it would entertain the people to see in the evening, erm their faces on the screen. They couldn't hear any speech. erm These films could only just run and show the faces, show the expressions, show a little action. And this really was the basis therefore of the first films, they were really demonstrations that pictures could move, and this was sufficient for people to pay a few pence to come in erm and look at the films. Now this was the kind of man that George Albert Smith of Brighton was, and he made a whole range of short films, as all the early filmmakers did, erm publishing a catalogue every so often, and offering his films for sale to other showmen, because as the years passed erm these films became extremely popular. Now we're dealing with the year about eighteen ninety-six onwards, and the filmmakers of this time erm would make this large number of short films, make several in a day if they had the, if the, they had the opportunity and the subjects, and then they would print catalogues of these pictures and market them. Market them not only in this country but abroad. It became quite big business. Now I remember it was about oh twenty years ago that Rachel Low, the daughter of celebrated cartoonist, and I, we were both on the staff of the British Film Institute then, erm decided we would write the early history of British film. And we travelled down to Brighton from London and met in his home George Albert Smith, who was then in his nineties, a charming old man, very good-looking, and very, very interested to share his experiences of the past with us, and I remember he showed us his account books. And there it was, in the late nineties, he was adding up his pence and his shillings and the odd pound or two here and there, these were his costs of making the pictures that he was making in those days, and then when you turned over and we came to nineteen hundred, nineteen hundred and one, nineteen hundred and two, erm the figures had broadened and under the pounds into three figures and then into four. And this was what kind of business filmmaking became. It was a matter of very small beginnings for everybody, and then as the pictures that they made became more and more popular, more and more acceptable, used not merely in fairgrounds or in odd corners of shops and this sort of thing, for the odd fifteen minutes or twenty minutes of movie, but entered into the music halls, became one of the acts in the music hall entertainment erm this really was the foundation of a new industry, a new industry of entertainment, a new industry of information. This was the background to it all. George Albert Smith was later of course erm to come on and make a big name, a world name for himself as the inventor of the first colour process, a very simple, two-colour process, but it was invented by him in Brighton, and it was the first world colour process. And it was patented erm in nineteen hundred and six, and was called Kinemakolour . And in nineteen hundred and eight, erm this Kinemakolour was put on the market with a special company and erm Smith in nineteen hundred and eight was awarded a silver medal by the Royal Society of Arts erm for his invention. And this colour process was to be used erm Delhi Durbar for example was, was filmed in colour by Smith, and this marvellous colour process, at least marvellous for its day, erm was known everywhere. Unfortunately it resulted in a patent war, and finally by the mid-teens, about nineteen fifteen, erm the process died as a result of the rivalries of other companies. Nonetheless, George Albert Smith's name stands as the inventor of a colour process which was viable, which was shown worldwide, and which presented for the first time on the screen a photographically produced colour picture. All the others had been hand-tinted or hand-painted, and this after all was not the real thing. So this was another reason for his, his place in film history. Now you may wonder the kind of films these early pioneers made. I've mentioned one or two kinds of very simple films, but of course they soon became much more erm elaborate in a, in a simple way elaborate. They lasted much longer, they lasted five or ten minutes. erm Some were what we would call nowadays newsreels. Some of these newsreels I might say were faked, I don't mean George Albert Smith's were faked, but erm there was for example the case erm of the Boer War. The Boer War was on and the first sort of major conflict erm in the period of movie history, and naturally people wanted to see what the war was like. So it was much easier if you hadn't got a lot of money to fake some action, and produce some fake Boer war newsreels than to do the real thing. So I'm afraid that some were faked and some were real. And this was to be the case with a lot of actuality pictures of the time. Nonetheless it was news really which brought people in beyond the mere curiosity of seeing pictures that moved, brought people in erm to these early shows. They wanted to see a battleship launched, they wanted to see Royalty in action, they wanted to see anything that was happening which was an event in the world, and so cameramen like George Albert Smith, and eventually George Albert Smith's staff, would go out around the world, much as it would happen now but in a much simpler way, erm to make actuality pictures. And in the course of time they began to make simple documentaries erm which would be something say the study of Pekin, if you happened to go there, or Italy if you happened to go, any country that to which you could go, you went and you made not just newsreels but also erm documentary studies of these films, of these places. That is they would really be the beginnings of what we would now call travelogues. Travelogues were immensely popular, people hadn't the resources to travel in those days easily unless they were wealthy, and here was a chance to see what the world was like in various places that were inaccessible erm to the average member of the audience. And then there were the vaudeville films. films which featured, although you couldn't hear their voices unfortunately yet, featured erm famous singers and artists of, of the variety stage. They would be featured and then a live player with a piano or what have you erm would produce the music which went with the action on, on the screen. And then there were trick films. Now the trick films came particularly out of the pioneers' own attitude to their apparatus. erm If you were not so much an artist as a technician, you became as a technician interested in what this camera of yours could do, and therefore George Albert Smith, who was primarily I would say a technical man rather than an artist, he was very interested in the trick film. Now trick films were the sort of first visual magic that the cinema could produce and erm these, these films you would see for example a motor car disintegrate and then reassemble itself, this kind of thing, people's clothes change, drop off and a new set of garments would come on, all this sort of thing, people's faces would change, their environment would change, their chairs would collapse under them and rebuild themselves, this sort of thing which could be done relatively easily once you knew how to do it. And the trick films were these, in a sense, the magic comedy form which erm these early films took. They were very, very popular and went all over the world. Well these were the main films. Only later were, was one to find it possible to develop a small comedy action or a small dramatic action on the screen, this would be around nineteen hundred and three, four, five, about five or six years from the beginning, that films of this sort would make. Well now I have in front of me my book that I wrote with Rachel Lowe about these erm these early film erm makers of Britain, and leafing it over I see some of the facts which lie behind the Brighton's, Brighton's contribution to this. Esmé Collins, I read, was a well-known Brighton portrait photographer, one of the very first to take up the production of cinema films in eighteen ninety-six. So Smith, as I said earlier on, was not alone in this. He erm was himself erm one of a school of Brighton filmmakers. And then there was John Bennett Stanford, who was a wealthy amateur, who was one of the people who pioneered the filming of the Boer War. And his films were shown in London at the Alhambra, and were, this was something new and exciting and erm therefore helped to establish the popularity of the newsreel. Incidentally you might like to know where George Albert Smith worked in Brighton. He was erm in St. Anne's Well Gardens, erm that's where his address was, and eventually erm he was erm able to take over erm quite a considerable estate in Brighton, and develop it erm as a studio. Now erm some of this films might be of some interest. Among the trick films, for example, he made use of double exposure as early as eighteen ninety-eight in a group of films, these are titles, ‘Cinderella and the Fairy Godmother’, ‘The Mesmerist’, ‘The Corsican Brothers’, things like this, and he was one of the pioneers incidentally of the close-up. Usually it's D W Griffith of America who's given credit for the intelligent use of the close-up erm but Smith was immensely interested in the portraiture area of photography, and made a series of films which were called at the time ‘facials’. ‘Facials’ meaning erm films of people pulling faces, grimaces, caricatures, human caricatures really. And this was a most interesting branch of early filmmaking, it was the mobile portrait, the portrait where people's faces were in action. erm I see here one of his catalogue entries for eighteen ninety-eight, ‘Waves and Spray. Fine effect. Rough sea dashing against stone groin.’ This was the kind of thing which fetched people in, in the very early days. erm Well these, I think, I think this perhaps gives sufficient of the feeling of erm the kind of work these people did. But I would like to say just one word about what I felt about the character of George Albert Smith. I knew him over a period of about two years before he died. I actually invited him when I was Director of the British Film Academy to come to London erm and with the help erm of Brian Coe of Kodak we actually reconstructed about thirty seconds of this two-colour process erm and put it on a screen for our filmmaker colleagues in London. And this was a tremendously moving moment, I think. There he was, this very old man, talking about his process with tremendous enthusiasm, and then we said, ‘Well all right, now we'll all sit down, we'll have a look at exactly what this two-colour process looked like. We've only managed to reconstruct about thirty seconds of it, but this at any rate will give the impression of the way it was.’ Well in a sense we were able to give this very quiet manner and very enthusiastic, very explicit, very kindly, very polite erm man his chance to relive for a moment erm this great contribution that he made in the past. He was able to come back, and this was in the late nineteen fifties, half a century later, and tell us all about it. well known as centres of academic learning and excellence, where people are taught to degree-level standard. They've always had links with industry and commerce, but over the last few years they've recognised the need to develop and publicise their links. The University of Sussex is no exception. Over the past decade it's built up an international reputation for the quality of its scientific and technological research. In fact it's one of the very top U. K. research universities. It's high standing is shown by its being in the top three universities, along with Oxford and Cambridge, in the national table which shows the proportion of income derived from research grants. For example, last year alone, the University earned a total of four point nine million pounds from research grants and contracts, a figure which has risen despite the recession. About a third of the four point nine million pounds came from contracts placed by industrial firms, government departments and other agencies, for work to solve specific problems. Much of this work has been done for the larger national and international companies. However the University also runs an extensive Services for Industry programme, designed to help smaller local firms in Sussex. And in the last four years about one hundred local firms have been given help. I've been joined today by Professor Mike Springford, Professor of Experimental Physics at the University, and Chairman of the Services for Industry Coordinating Group, and John Golds, the University's Industrial Liaison Officer. They've come along to talk about the Services for Industry programme, and what the University can offer local firms. So Mike, what's the background to the Services for Industry programme? Well you could say that erm our background goes back erm twenty-five years, in fact, we've had a considerable involvement with industry both local and national for as long as the University has been in existence, which is now nearly twenty-five years. Now in this respect, of course, twenty-five years is rather a short time in the life of a university, and a good deal of this time has been spent in building up a research base, and now, as you mentioned in your erm remarks a few moments ago, Andrew, we have an enviable research record in a very wide range of disciplines. Now about four or five years ago, we felt that the time was right to promote our involvement with industry and commerce rather more vigorously. I think erm there were essentially three reasons for this. The first was to give some form, and to formalise, our collaboration, and our involvement with existing industrial colleagues. The second was a conviction that many of us had, that we do indeed have a great deal to offer, by way of expertise and consulting, from the campus. And thirdly, and certainly not erm least, we hoped ourselves to benefit at a time when the Government cutbacks were just come into force, which were requiring us to raise erm more income from non-government source. And what sort of facilities can the University offer? Well I suppose most of those, but certainly not all, are on the Science side of the University. Let me just mention erm just a few. We organise ourselves in different schools of studies. If I mention them and then perhaps give you a few examples of the sort of facilities which erm which we have available. In Engineering and Applied Science, there's a very wide experience in the broad area of electronics and computers and micro-processors, computer-aided design, and such topics as biomedical engineering and instrumentation. In my own school, which is Mathematical and Physical Sciences, there is a considerable expertise in erm materials, in the study of surfaces using electron microscopy, in subjects like opto-electronics, in the use of radio isotopes and mathematical modelling say. In Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, one finds a whole range of analytical tools, experience with erm polymers, and again the chemistry of surfaces and interfaces. And in Biological Sciences, erm one finds erm subjects like drug testing, plant physiology and biochemistry, and subjects like speech analysis and synthesis. In addition to this, of course, on the campus there are other erm units. We have erm a special research unit, which we call Micro-processors, Instrumentation and Control. In addition to this, of course, there's a good deal of energy research goes on in the campus, and erm there's another unit which we call the Science Policy Research Unit. And so, John, how have these University facilities benefited local firms? Well as Mike said, since the inception of the Service for Industry programme in nineteen eighty, the University of Sussex has helped nearly a hundred local companies. Some jobs are problem solving, or analysis, some are much more involved. You see a university has a wide spread of expertise and facilities, which is well beyond the finance of a small company, and even sometimes a larger company, especially when the expertise or facility required is out of the ordinary. We are, by this programme, doing our best to serve Britain's future by working with industry? And can you give me some examples of the firms that the University's managed to help? Yes. The University does work for a variety of large companies, such as Rolls Royce, I C I, Shell, B P. These are international companies or, put another way, household names. However, I cannot divulge the names of local companies, because in the majority of cases, the results of the work are confidential. What I can give are examples of the expertise and facilities provided. For example, analysis, using the N M R machine. Gas chromatography. Tailor-made short course for individual companies, to bring their staff up to date with modern computer techniques. Designs of locks. Design of a new magnet detection system. Medical research. Mathematical progress of schools of our education area. These are just some of the facilities and expertise that have been made available to industry. As another example, and totally unrelated to science, a couple of years ago we undertook a project to look into the organisation of a charitable trust. And so you've been able to help a number of firms. How have the firms found out about what the University offers? How's the programme been publicised? Well we do this in a number of ways. We collect together most of the information erm in a single brochure which we call ‘Services for Industry’. And indeed we've just erm put together a new edition of this erm document erm it collects together the range of advisory and consultancy services on the campus, together with a list of the sort of test equipment and facilities around, and it also notes other things, such as M S E courses and short courses which can be put on. And then from time to time, erm in fact a few times during the year, we circulate a newsletter to something like a thousand erm companies on our list. Yes, I think in addition to that we, the University participates in exhibitions. For example, last February at Birmingham, at an exhibition called Barclays Techmark, the University participated. It is also going to Eastbourne, to an exhibition organised by the Confederation of British Industries, and to another in Brighton, on Technology Transfer. We all have close ties with the Southeast Region of the C B I. In fact they held one of their regular meetings here last September. We also work very closely with the Federation of Sussex Industries, and they will be having one of their monthly meetings at the University in November, and we also hope to organise a joint open day with the F S I next June or July. The University is a member of the Brighton-Hove Chamber of Commerce, and it is also on the Management Board of the local Business Enterprise Agency. This agency, supported by the towns of Brighton and Hove, is sponsored by the local business, with the aim of advising people willing to form their own business and thereby create jobs. Also earlier this year the University formed a Managing Directors Club. Well that sounds quite interesting. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? The club has about sixty members from industry and commerce, with East and West Sussex, and the boundaries of the surrounding counties. It is organised by the University of Sussex. Aims are to provide an opportunity for industry and the University to meet, and assess each other 's needs, and for industry to find out what we are doing. It is also a vehicle for industrialists to meet each other, and discuss common problems. The club meets three or four times a year. So far the meetings have been held at the University, but the plan is to move the club's meetings around the counties of East and West Sussex. Membership is open to managing directors and chief executives of industry and commerce. Okay, so what you've told me so far's fine. But I'm sure there are people listening who are thinking, ‘Well, how much is all this going to cost if I want some advice?’ Can you give us some idea of that? Well obviously this very much depends on the expertise and service required. If it's just advice, that service is normally provided free. Analysis of a single sample, using say, one of the smaller machines, will cost as little as twenty-five pounds. An investigation, or a design of a new system, are obviously much more expensive, even a few thousand pounds. There are, however, government-sponsored schemes whereby the research councils support research in conjunction with industry through co-optive studentships or co-optive grants. These are not expensive. For example a studentship to undertake research leading to a higher degree can cost as little as five hundred pound per year for the three years. Well we've been talking about the benefits which the local firms obviously gain from the work that's going on here, but the question could be asked, what benefit do the academics in the University and also the students gain from the, the programme? Well first of all I think there are a number of intangible benefits which accrue from us making new contacts outside the University, and tackling and discussing new problems in different areas. But certainly, on the more tangible side, it's true to say that an increasing proportion of the research in the University in widely different areas erm is supported now erm through this programme. I can give you a couple examples of the more tangible advantages with reference to schemes which are administered by the erm Science and Engineering Research Council. erm One of them is called the Teaching Company Scheme, in which partners from universities and manufacturing companies get together to tackle problems with the objective of increasing manufacturing performance in some area. erm Another example is the CASE Scheme. This stands for Cooperative Awards in Science and Engineering and erm under this scheme, a company erm can have a problem tackled by a research student working in a university and erm a supervisor, and indeed in this case, the input, the financial input, by the company may be quite small, may only amount to a few hundred pounds. One of the other advantages of this scheme is that the student erm spends some months each year in the company, and in a number of cases in the past this has led to the student erm getting a job when he leaves. And finally on the undergraduate side, a number of our erm contacts have led to the undergraduates being able to erm find vacation work. And finally there have been some items in some of the national newspapers recently concerning university science parks. I understand that Sussex University doesn't have a science park, but in fact it's got a research park. Can you tell me what the difference is, please, John? Many science parks have been developed through the combined initiative of a university, local authority, or development agency, and a finance house. The buildings is built speculatively. In other words, tenants are then sought. Our approach at Sussex is different. Departments have forged close links with a number of companies in the area of research and development. Because of the benefits, the close collaboration, excellent facilities, some companies wish to cement even closer, more permanent links. This can be achieved by siting their R and D base, or part of it, on the campus. Companies do not, always, on the basis of existing collaboration, wish to move directly to a purpose-built building. At present four companies have part of their research and development base on campus, renting existing space. By using this facility they can further develop the links and use our services. One company,Asansiki , a subsidiary of Toyota, is building a fourteen hundred square foot building on the campus, and an international high technology company is about to build a ten thousand square foot building. The agreement for this should be reached on the second of November. These two companies will form the nucleus of the University of Sussex Research Park. From this you can see that there is a major difference between our approach and the conventional science park, in that we are not undertaking speculative development, but are using what is termed internally within the University as ‘the incremental approach’. Okay then. Suppose I'm an industrialist listening to this programme, and I've been very interested in what you've been saying, and I feel that I've got a problem that the University could possibly give me some advice on. How do I go about it? Well that's quite simple, Andrew, as an answer. All they need do is to contact me, John Golds, either by phone or by letter. I will then do my best to see whether we can solve their problem. My telephone number is Brighton six oh six seven double five. Well thank you very much to both Mike Springford and John Golds. Hello. This is the start of a short series on science, in which we're going to explore some of the boundaries of our physical universe as we understand it. Space, time, temperature and so on. Now that winter's coming on, what would be more appropriate than a programme about low temperatures? And by low temperatures I don't just mean a few degrees below freezing, but the world close to what scientists call ‘absolute zero’. And to help us in these explorations we have as a guide Dr. Low Thomson. Low, when we talk about low temperatures, what do we actually mean? I think depends upon the, the problem. A room temperature might be a low temperature for certain erm physical phenomena, but by and large I think in physics low temperatures tends to mean temperatures below the erm boiling point of liquid helium, I think. And how cold is that? Well, on the centigrade scale that's at minus two six nine approximately, but in fact we in physics tend to work always with an, what we call an absolute scale of temperature. Room temperature is around about three hundred kelvins, but why we call it absolute is it, erm the lowest temperature one could ever get to is in fact designated as zero. So that's interesting in itself. What you're saying is that there is actually a limit to how cold you can get. In the way that erm that the temperature scale has been defined yes, that's correct. There in fact originally were different ways suggested. Logarithmic ways would have meant there would be, there would have been no limit in fact, one could have always gone to, to, one would essentially have minus infinity as, as the lowest. But erm on the absolute scale of temperature, zero kelvin is the lowest one can get, and all one can hope to do is to get ever closer to that zero, when one goes to low temperatures. I think we're probably going to come back to that again in a minute. But let's talk for a moment about how one actually tries to get low temperatures. How do you do that? erm As far as we're concerned, we do much the same I suppose as, as the housewife does in her kitchen. She buys a refrigerator, plugs it in, and puts her food in there, and gets to some, maybe minus ten, or minus fifteen erm centigrade that way. We essentially buy some rather larger refrigerators which will liquify some gases for us. We have two in the University, one that liquifies nitrogen from the air, and another which liquifies erm helium gas which we buy in from erm Texas in fact it comes. And the air when it's liquified gives us a starting base temperature of seventy-seven kelvins, whereas the helium when it's liquified gives us a base temperature of four point two kelvins. Basically it's very easy, isn't it, to get down to about seventy-seven degrees above absolute zero? Liquid air, liquid nitrogen is, is about that temperature and, and it's That's right, it's easier to get hold of. It's fairly easy to get hold of, it doesn't cost too much to liquify. The, the, the, the cost of liquifying air is around about ten p a litre. So that one, fairly readily, can get down to about minus a couple of hundred degrees below room temperature Yes. Something of that order. Very easily, yes. And, and, and liquid nitrogen you'll find in, in all walks of life, in hospitals all over the place that erm farmers now often have it in their farm, they, they That's the sort of thing you use to burn warts off fingers and That sort of thing, that's right. What happens when you try and get below that? It gets progressively harder to get down in temperature, does it? You have to erm spend progressively more because it, it, it, it just is as you say much much harder to get down. You have to have bigger compressors, higher pressures, and, and better insulation. erm Helium does liquify at a much lower temperature than any other element and in fact it was not until erm this century that erm helium was finally liquified. All the other elements had been erm liquified in, in, during the Victorian period. How on earth would that have happened in the first instance? Did people expect it to be liquified and work on it until it happened, or was it just an accidental discovery? No, there was a, a programme right throughout the erm second half of the nineteenth century to try to liquify all elements. There was speculation in fact that helium might not liquify at all. People had so much difficulty with it. What's interesting, Brian, by the way, is that, that helium is, it is the sort of the life and blood of low temperature physicists. Most peculiar element. It was discovered not on earth in fact but on the sun in the first place, in about eighteen sixty-eight erm absorption lines were seen, and, and it was a long time after that before people realised there was some helium on the earth and, and, and eventually erm helium, some gas was found bubbling up through, from a pit in the Black Forest and, and analysed and found to be helium. I see. And then, erm it was at a much later stage, in the nineteen twenties or perhaps a little bit earlier than that they actually first managed to get enough of it to liquify. Nineteen oh eight. Nineteen oh eight. Is, is in some sense the starting point of low temperature physics, erm One doesn't want to mention too many names but one erm the sort of grandfather of, of the whole subject is a man called Cameling Onis who in the, erm in Holland in the Leiden erm University there, first liquified helium. He was an astonishing man because not only had, no sooner had he done that, than he then performed a tremendously important experiment. Only three years after that he put some erm mercury into a glass capillary and measured its resistance, and in nineteen eleven he discovered superconductivity. It's quite remarkable that a mere three years after liquifying helium he, he erm had got this tremendously important erm effect. This is one of the most important effects in low temperature physics, the fact that electrons, in many metals, go into a superconducting state in which they have no resistance whatsoever, no electrical resistance. All right. Well let's just take a step backwards. We're, we're getting rather complicated here. It's the electrons in metals which actually carry the electricity, is that right? That's right, yes. And what you're saying is that if you get to sufficiently low temperatures, you get a situation in which the resistance in the metal drops to zero. What's the implication of that? Well, the resistance of course is caused by the fact that electrons as they move around in, in, in metals, bounce off things and this erm causes their, their flow to be impeded. Now erm suddenly, it sets in at one particular temperature, this resistance just disappears entirely. First of all it's a, it's a most astonishing theoretical phenomenon that this should happen, and in fact it took a whole half of century later before an explanation could be found as to what, what was happening. Many applications that involve superconductivity, and around us today we see I think lots and lots of erm important applications. What comes to mind erm is that in the last erm fifteen years or so erm we've been able to make magnets using title deeds. Right. And, I mean I fully sympathize with the gentleman, but I feel his lawyer should explain this to him, and also I feel, why should he pay such a extortionate rate of poll tax and have to pay again for grass cut and street swept? Cos that's exactly what it is. Okay. Thank you very much indeed for that. Mrs from Edinburgh, good morning. Er, good morning Mr Johnston. I'm on on about the same subject. I stay in the Slateford district and I'm in a multi-storey flat, I bought my house three year ago. Now, when I started to ba er buy my house, we are paying, we were paying twenty seven pound a month for the upkeep of the building, it's now went up to thirty four pound twenty two pence a month. It's absolut And wha so sorry, who who have bought your flat from? Is that Oh oh sorry dear! The co Edinburgh Corporation. Edinburgh District Council, right. Yes. Er, now we are paying thirty four pound twenty two pence a month for the upkeep of this building, that, as far as I know there's twelve tenants in this block has bought their house. Now, when I moved in here twenty five years ago it was a very, very nice block! It really was. It's deteriorated and deteriorated something terrible! How many flats are in it altogether do you think? There's er , there's nine, it's a nine storey building. Right. And er we're paying, and every time the corporation rents go up, what we pay a month also goes up. Now, as I say, it started off with twenty nine pound, and it's now up to thirty four pound. So so what do you get for the thirty four pounds the lift? Well , this is the thing, we have a caretaker but er fo for his services, but I've been at the council and I have got nowhere, I have from the corporation, there's an awful lot of people complaining but they'll do nothing about it! That Complaining about what? The state the building's in! Right. I mean, I have done a lot about it, and I'm the only one that has, as I say, got my mouth going and done something about it. But nobody will back me up! Sa so so what are you getting? Yo you you're getting a caretaker That's that's all all the time, that a door entry system, a lift? Well we've got the lift, yes. But I mean, when you think of the amount of people in this block that's bought their house and the state that the building's in, I mean, I have told them in the corporation that a lick of paint would nah do it any harm. Mm. Because it is, it's deteriorated, and deteriorated something terrible! The Yeah. building is really shocking! And I mean, we were told it was a first class area but there's, if anybody walked into the building just now you would nah see it was a first class area to look at the state the building's in! I mean, you know, when you think of what you're paying as a, the other gentleman was saying, we are paying the thirty four pound twenty two pence a month, then you've also got your poll tax above that, and then your mortgage as well! Mm. A , and so, to me, I think for what we're paying we should be getting some service and we are not getting it! This is where I am so annoyed! But er I wish some of the other tenants in this block would back me up and do something about it, but nobody will! They're all saying and they're all talking but I'm the only one, I have been at the council, I have been at the councillor, I have been at Waterloo Place, but nobody will back me up at all! And I think for what we're paying we should be having a wee bit er, the dir , the building should be a looking a wee bit more respectable and presentable to what it is! Okay. Thanks very much indeed for that. Mrs from Edinburgh, good morning. Good morning Mr Johnston. It's actually about where the squeeze should be taking place. Mm mm. It really annoys me when people get on and do the young people down! There are not an awful lot of jobs going about, get that straight to the people that, you know! Now, the squeeze should be from the tax at the very top. All these conservatives sit at their conference saying what they're going to do to the unemployed and the fraud and what have you! We had a business man on Question Time who was saying that five hundred million pound fraud going on in the benefits, right? Mhm. But he said that is a pittance compared to the tax dodging at the top, that's it's billions! Now I really do feel people, I I'm amazed at the working class people! They don't stick together. They they should see this, and they should be pushing it and saying you get your house in order before tackle the young people. I know the fraud goes on, and it's wrong, but I can understand it in some cases. What because you see th , people a at the, at the bottom end of society see people at the top end indulging in tax avoidance schemes and things like that, and off Yes! shore bank accounts and think well if they can get away with it why can't we? Yes! Well a , I I didn't say anyone should get away with fraud. No that's wha , no I see that. But You know, but I do, I can understand if you've got desperate, people will try anything, especially for the young families. The there's Now , I'm a pensioner, and I think it's a scandal what we get for a pension after all the years that you, you fight for you, you put away for your old age, and before you know it you've nothing! And then you become dependant on the state and you have these Tory as smug as you like! White collars, upstarts! I mean their morality! They have their own morality I think we all know that! But, the morality a and to go on about Christianity and again,tha I feel ashamed sometimes when I think of myself you know, a Christian, that's not Christianity! They, I mean th er, they're caring and sharing, and theirs is greed and gaining! Okay. Thank you very much indeed for that. Alfie from Edinburgh, good morning. Er, good morning, yeah. I'd like to talk about er, Wallace Mercer and er, I just cannae let him get away with this er in my opinion he's a two-faced twit! He's er he's saying that er the shifting of the ground's political but I'd to remember him that er,th it's the council that's doing their job, he's not doing his job. They're there to pe , to protect our land, and that's what they're doing. Right? And also, he's got a short memory when talks about political, things like that! Does he not remember when he brought John Major to Tynecastle? Right? Does he not realise that most er Hearts fans, and I'm a Hearts fan are not Tories, he is, but most of the fans are not! Right? So er he's got a very short memory. He does nay, he does nay think, he does nay think before he speaks. So,sa so what did, what did you make of what he was saying today, it's either Hermestone or he's gonna upgrade Tynecastle? Erm no er, I'd li I'd like to see er him getting, er shifting, yeah to a different place, but er, he's gotta remember , the greenbelt comes first. So I hope he's listening! So so, you'd you'd say that you would want to go to Ingleston? Er, yes I'd, I think I would go along with that, yeah. Yeah. But but you think the council should protect the greenbelt from both the development proposals of Hibs and Hearts? Yeah, and er, certainly. Yeah, that's what they're there for, they're doing their job it's him that's not doing his job. Okay. Thanks very much indeed for that. Mr from Kirkcaldy, good morning. Hello! Yeah, I'd like to speak about the the squeeze on the benefits. Mhm. Er, why can't they just look at, er do a means test for child benefit? Er, if those that were earning over a certain amount, who certainly don't need this child benefit to same the degree anyway, that's those of at the lower end of the pay scale we could they could certainly save a lot of money, and they wouldn't have to do the squeeze down on the ones that would have the most. I mean, child benefit if, erm is, is a very emotional issue isn't it? And and people say it's sometimes the only er money tha that a mother wo gets that she can call her own and and use in the way that she wants to. Yeah, that's possibly true, but And they say, you know,ev even in apparently wealthy families, er, you know, because the way the money's divided up at the end of the week, or the end of the month or whatever, that that, the no the child benefit money's all, all the woman gets. Well th , the money's for the child's benefit in the first place. Er, in double income families, certainly in double income families, surely the wife's gonna have more control over the money that she earns and the money that she can use? Okay. But I mean, er you can see the, you can see the point of that and and presumably, yes, there must be lots of very wealthy people who who er, just get the child benefit and hardly notice it but at the same time, couldn't we means test the old age pension? Cos presumably there must be an awful lot of wealthy old age pensioners about as well who, who could do with a bit less er, from the state because they've got plenty of their own, er and give a bit more to people who don't? Well I, I think that's, that is also a possibility. I think every, all the benefits should definitely be means tested, I know that most of them are to a degree. Erm but there comes a point where th , the government, the line that the government draws for means testing's always very low. Whe , why to take the, the sting out of the issue they could put the, the line higher up on the earning scale, or higher up on the sa the receiving scale for the older ones who have so , possibly stopped working? Now, I know that these people have worked all their life to get their money and their saving savings and things like that, but if they're able to manage on wha with less benefit from the government, surely they shouldn't have to watch other people who struggling and in dire needs because of that? Okay. Thank you very much indeed for that. Wonder what people make of that? Means test all benefits. Old age pension, family allowance and things like that, just to make sure that those that need get a bit extra.. You're listening to Dial David Johnston, 's the number to dial. Mrs from Loanhead, good morning. Good morning Mrs Johnston. It's about an article by Alistaire in the Evening News. I don't know if you've read it? It's about the new council tax stating that erm people will, householders will not be, receive any notification of the value of their house and of which various bands are just placed. Apparently if Are you sure about that? Yes. It's a, I'm favouring it, in, it was in the Edinburgh Evening News, October the second. Right. I've got the cutting here. Mhm. This also states that under the government rules and the Lothian regional council can only publish the list in public libraries. And the, this will appear by the end of November, and people will only have after this first council tax demands in March, they've got to appeal if they think they're in the wrong band. Now what I would like Mr Alistaire and the rest of the Scottish M P's is to bring up in parliament a Scotland will have to be revalued every five years as done in the past where England have only been revalued every seventeen years, which I think is most unfair. I find it, find it hard to believe that you're not gonna be told th the valuation of your house, in as Well, it in a , in as much as er, you know evaluations an arbitrary, and presumably there must be some right of appeal against the decision taken by the district valuer, or whoever carries out the valuation of the house. Yeah. I've got the cutting here Right. and it says, you can only appeal it will appear in November, that's when it's going to be, er put into the library Mhm. and any appeals against valuation have to be made soon after the first council tax demands are received at the end of March. Right. Mr said, I advise people to check in case there has been a mistake. They Right. should be told the evaluation personally and given a chance to appeal if they feel it is too high . Okay. Thanks very much for bringing that to our attention. Mr from Fyfe, good morning! Good morning! Er, I just wanted to talk about the cuts, er, proposed cuts in pensions. Yeah? Mhm. Erm I would go further than erm performance related pay for the cabinet and, and so on, and I would actually put them all on income support erm and see how they could cope! Or er, or on the dole er level of er of money. Erm because I don't think these people er appreciate er, what it is to have to count every penny. Erm and I didn't get any indication from the Tory conference, watching it, that er, that they had any more idea. Of course, there was that er World in Action programme a couple of years ago wasn't there, when the Tory MP from Newcastle, I think it was, went on the, on the dole for two or three week, but I Yeah. mean, presumably it's quite easy for the first two or three weeks, it's after, after a couple of months that er life gets more difficult. Well absolutely! I mean I'd like to see erm I'd like to see how they would like it. That could be the first cut in my opinion. They're on seventy and eighty thousand er er a year! Er, the economic situation is is entirely their fault, er, not that I'm saying that the Labour would do any better, but erm I'd like to see a bit more er, a bit more opposition from the er, from the Labour party and er, not so much direct action, but saying, you know, things do not have to be like this! There do not have to be any homeless people! Er, and it's er outrageous er that there are! Erm, but er it's, it's quite wrong that pensioners and er, the poorest should have to take cuts again erm when there's people on such high salaries. Okay. Thanks very much, er for you call. Hilary from Edinburgh, good morning. Hello. I'd just like to disagree with the gentleman that said that er the, the child benefit should be mean tested for us. Aha. But , I think it is for your children, but erm I've I worked er, before I had the children and Listen , I tell you, I tell you what Mrs , it's an awfully bad line. Put the phone down we'll call you back in in just a second because i , we can't really make out what you're saying. Sorry about that. We'll come back to you in a second. Er, Jim from Shots hello? Yeah. Good morning again David. Er, can I ask Wallace Mercer, if he's still listening to the programme, if he was considered the environment in his plans for the football stadium? Er Ingleston seems to be the only feasible, er site, where the wi , could be a proposed er rapid rail transit system in operation. You know, I'm like the others yo I'm like you like trains don't you? Well I do like trains, but it's not just a case of liking trains, okay, yes, I like, I like trains, I like, I mean I'm old enough to remember the steam trains, it's not just a case of that. I read in the papers last week benzene, the benzene is used in unleaded petrol. Mm. They, they have found dangerously high levels of benzene in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and other places, and this benzene apparently it can cause cancer. Now you take your choice, it's either benzene in unleaded petrol or lead in leaded petrol! Also, in today's er Scotland on Sunday, gathered, they found it not just Edinburgh, but Britain as whole I think. They found there are higher levels of carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide pollution from vehicle exhausts has increased by forty two percent Right. over the last ten years! The, I mean, how long have to be, have we to, er and I'm I'm disgusted with Edinburgh that nobody has phoned in on this sort of point! Er I, they don't seem to ca , er do the Edinburgh people not care about their environment or ? Well especially after that survey last year Yeah! tha that that showed er dangerously Yes! high Yes! levels of er, of er Mm! poisonous gases in various parts of the city. Mhm. Okay. Than thanks for that. Tom from Edinburgh, good morning. Good morning David! I, I didn't intend to come on but I think it's one of the best er, Sunday mornings I've had in years! Er, with three ladies and a gentleman come and support the pensioner, I mean this is really great! It gives me a the energy to go on and and er fight all the harder. Now, regarding the means testing of the pensioners the means testing with pensioners is dynamite for any government! They've got ten million pensioner and yet about two million of them are, are quite well off Mhm. and er, I can assure you if they started means testing pensioners they would, any government would go out on their ear! Er, and by the way But I mean, surely i if there's not enough to go round then those that need it most should get most? There is enough to go round. We're still one of the richest countries in the world and a we , and er the people they ha , there's the wealth is only about er ten percent of the people on, and about eighty percent of the wealth! Right. But it's unlikely that the conservative party is likely, going to embark on a major distribution of wealth programme between now and the next election. Yeah. And and, you know, the benefit's problem's one that's pressing presumably because Of course, it is! because they're running short of cash. Well they, they better start with perhaps the rich? And er, by the way, pensions, pensions are er, are taxed! You get all these pensions taxed! And there's loads of people just over er, getting a pension and getting a two pensions and tha they're paying tax as well! So your pension's taxed! So, so that's er really a way of means testing it er more painlessly? Okay. Thanks for that. Jim from Edinburgh, good morning. Aye, I'd like to speak on this er, outrageous proposal to sa , you know, screw down the people on benefit. This, this present government and it's predecessor has attacked the social security ee system ferociously already! Th er, industrial injuries benefit's been virtually abolished er ee along with such things as the reduced earnings allowance. And there's been screws on housing benefit, we've had the withdrawal of the right of students to claim income support and housing benefit, and unemployment benefit during vacation time. Erm, to think that those who are dependant on benefit from public funds are gonna be expected to suffer still more is, as I said, wholly outrageous! Bu but I mean, what alternative is there if there's not enough money meet the benefit bill? Well, I mean, who says that there isn't enough enough money to meet the benefit bill? I mean, I know the government say that, but but think of the money that we er , must be saving now on our armaments bill. We, with the, you know, detente, and the collapse of the the U S S R and we'll be saving a fortune now on, on armaments so surely that could be But but well I don't, I don't ploughed back? Well I don't think we are though, because I mean Well we we've just, we've just ordered the forth polar , er the the forth Trident submarine as the er you know, the the the, the slimming down of the armies yet to take to effect. Presumably they're still, you know, flying around and, and and all the rest of it? Yeah, but ne , you know, nuclear weapons and so forth, surely those have been scaled down. We're told that erm you know, the ma , the massive redundancies in places like Ferranti is due to erm, you know, those resolutions Defence cut backs. Yeah. Between ea , between east and west. So the money, and a lot of money must be getting saved ee somewhere, so I don't see any reason why that couldn't be ploughed back into the,th th the benefit system. I mean, again, it's outrageous Mm. to say, only state retirement pensions payable on an earnings related basis. After all, people have contributed to these pensions during their working lives and in order to qualify for a full pension, you need to have paid into it for over forty years. Are you, is someone gonna pay into a insurance scheme for forty years and then suddenly be told, well you don't qualify? I mean, that's a classic case of changing the, the rules after the game's started! Right. Okay, thanks for that Jim. Er mi , Mrs back again, hopefully on a better line this time. Hello Mrs . Hello. Yes it is. Er, it's just I feel that I've worked all my days and did without and er er had put savings away and things like that so that when I stopped working to have children I would have money, but if you were means tested, and the money is for the children as well, anyway and the people who, you know, I don't mean that all people, a lot of people who are supposedly not having money, and getting all these things, they sell them and things like that. And I mean, all people do that, but why is it when you've worked you always seem to get hammered? If you're in a borderline sort of wage, you always get hammered for everything, and you don't seem to get any kind of But I mean that would just be an argument about where they set the level that you no longer were to qualify for child benefit, but I mean,bu , you know,presuma , presumably er,th the point the man was was making that er, the child benefit goes equally Aha. to , to the poorest in society and the richest Yes. in society. I mean Aha. you know, presumably the erm, Duchess of York qualifies for child benefit. Aha. If she ever has time to pop down the post office to get it. Yeah. I've, yeah I know, but it's just some days you, I know, I see what you mean, talking about that, but at the end it is for your children anyway, cos you know, that money should be for your children and if you have worked and you put the money away for them anyway, you've paid your taxes and things. Right. A and,we it, well that that takes us back to to er, to what I think, either er Tom or Jim was saying there that you know, if you're paying into something yo you you expect to er, to get out of it when and if you need it. Well you do. You know, and I mean we we work, you know, it's like er I mean I have to pay full poll tax and all these type of things too, even though my husband's on a sort of very er basic sort of wage, and I pay all these things you know. Okay. Thanks very much indeed for you call. Donald from Livingston good morning. Good morning. Er I've just woken up, sorry! Erm just something that came into my head e er cos the alarm switched on with your programme and it was a gentleman talking about the different taxes and what have you Mhm. and I thought come into my head, it's probably complete rubbish but it seems logical at the time which was, if you got rid of er, a lot of the various taxes that they paid and put everything on to VAT, apart from the fact that you'd be a few, just by upping the rate of VAT they would collect the extra monies, you'd save a lot of the money you'd pay in administration costs by, all the various different departments er And and there's, the more money you had the more things you would buy, so the more VAT you'd pay? That's right. So I mean But, but the only trouble everybody pays VAT because you're you pay for the things that you buy. I mean, they always get the money through But th the only trouble, the only trouble with with that is, it might knock the rate of VAT and u up an awful lot and the people who only buy very little will be able to even less. But the thing is, who, at the moment you're paying right, er you pa , you get your money off your employers, you pay your tax you go out and buy your things and pay, pay your taxes on whatever you buy Mhm. Oh yes! I, I see the whether it's services or goods theory behind it. then, when you've finished with it you're paying again yo , to the community tax, as it's going to be or whatever Okay. er to get them to take the stuff away. Okay. Listen, thanks for your call. We're right out of time. Er, thanks to everyone who's called the programme. What a horrible thought! Fancy turning on your alarm clock an an being woken up by me banging on! Have a very pleasant Sunday. The erm session this morning Erm to try to say other than the district council and that is the council What I'd like from If we take for example the low figure thirty one K, the county figure and the H B F figure of . What is the for example. I think it should be addressed sir that your amplification is nonexistent . Did you miss the question? I just heard . chairman shall I put my head on head on the block . Margaret , Department of the Environment. Erm I have to say that that these are largely my personal views of the member of the regional office, rather than obviously the Secretary of State at this stage in the proceedings. But I think if you went for the figure as proposed by the H B F, you would be going actively against the regeneration statutory which is the erm the government's policy. If you look at the strategic guidance for West and South Yorkshire, and I fully admit that we still have to see the erm the colour of regional guidance. But the strategic guidance for those two counties very firmly puts economic regeneration at the head of the list of objectives. I think if you let development rip for the want of a better word in North Yorkshire, as I suggest the House Builders Federation would do, then it would be active acting against the regeneration strategy. As for the figure proposed erm by Samuel Smith's representative. I think probably that is at completely the other end of the spectrum, and would be stifling the natural growth in North Yorkshire and what you would be doing then is is acting against the erm the inhab the existing inhabitant of North Yorkshire because you would probably be forcing them out of their county. I would therefore go for as you well know in our figure, somewhere around the middle line. Do you difference between your figure and that of the County Council is critical in in anyway? I think our figure gives a rather more measure of flexibility than does that of the County Council. Setting aside the exact figures chair, I think Leeds position is that left late at the goalposts set down by R P G two, erm our members are the City Council's grasped the mettle of accommodating the level of accommodation that that implies. It would make very significant incursions into our much against our wishes, to accommodate that, so that we would be looking to North Yorkshire to and work to the same levels of migration, the trend in migration as it were. Obviously a figure higher than that would take some pressure of us to make those incursions into the green belt, a lower figure conversely would require us to make higher la larger incursions into our greenbelt. So we're looking for North Yorkshire to play to the same rules basically. You you have already erm done it going into the greenbelt. Am I right in thinking that you wouldn't want to go on with these incursions ? That's right, our position is that we've already erm adversely affected our environment if you like as and the balanced er approach respectively needs to meet housing requirements. Erm but we've gone as far as we feel we need to. Erm other people should have to make the same sacrifices. But what are you saying about ? I'm not making any comment on specific figures. I'd like you to Well I can I decline the invitation. I I don't have a an answer an arithmetic answer. I think a figure was quoted earlier, I haven' read the of the with migration estimate for North Yorkshire. With that was a hundred percent a hundred percent migration . K was the figure. Right. Which is very similar to your colleague on the right.. Well a all I'm saying chair is that the principle of the calculation is is what I'm pleading on behalf on behalf of the City Council to be met. Mr . Er yes, Bill , Bradford Council. Erm Bradford and Leeds have er adopted a similar approach in their representations to er yourselves and certainly er I did not come here to take a er a part in the debate over specific figures. Er we er accepted the County Councils er sets of figures where we took issue with them is erm the failure to take account of one hundred percent inward migration trends. Not what that figure is or or what period it would be. But that percentage figure. Erm er on that basis erm we would and and even allowing for even allowing for a dense movement from Bradford to North Yorkshire, erm we as it said in our statements, are happy that that movement will not hinder urban regeneration in the urban area of the Bradford Metropolitan district. We refer too er in our statement er an absolute release figure of hectares in the greenbelt, and that is a percentage of our new housing allocations. In addition to that, it might interest you to know that er in excess of a further one hundred and sixty hectares of land is in our U D deposit version, U D P proposed to be released on greenfield sites on the edge of the built up areas. And that is in excess of fifty percent of the new housing allocation. Erm we in our recommendation to you have suggested a figure of forty six thousand, two hundred. Which is would give you County Council. Er su suffice We didn't want to get into too much of a discussion about numbers. If you the trends then er going on to the going on to the House Builders Federation figures, that would not cause us to release more land within the greenbelt, as would the lower figure of the County Council, based on seventy five percent inward migration. And by implication, the thirty nine thousand figure. Erm certainly the low figure would cause us tremendous problems er environmental problems of our own. Erm forty six thousand figure we feel is acceptable in that we still have to make environmental releases in the greenbelt, but erm the net outward movement would not hinder our urban regeneration. Erm the higher figure would obviously lead to bring into question something that er Miss has mentioned about er urban regeneration. Erm I think erm both the low and the high figures would cause us problems, and that is why we have have accepted the County Council's figures based on continuation of past trends, migration trends, which as my colleague from Leeds has pointed out earlier we are obliged to do and are continuing to do in following from R P G two in our depopulation of the . I think it maybe has to be said that we we picked these figures, not because we wanted to talk about the figures, but simply to use them as for you to hang on to. Mr . Yes, Roy , House Builders Federation. Erm naturally enough you wouldn't expect me to agree with Miss that erm the figures that we've put forward are against the regeneration strategy. It's certainly true, I don't think that we're letting development rip. However erm one thing I think that's got to be borne in mind and it picks up a point that erm Leeds have made, is that they're looking towards trendy migration, they say. With their balance of things. It has to be said that the current U D P of Leeds makes er an a an allowance of migration of net out migration of just over about nine thousand three hundred per five year period. That's embodied within the plan. If you look at the revised mid-year estimate, the figure there if we're keeping things in balance between county and and Leeds, is six thousand two hundred and fifty, net out migration. So there's if we're keeping things in balance, there's three thousand people per five year period, got to go somewhere. Now if on the same basis, you at the same time reduce the amount that the county's taking in, that exacerbates that particular group. And indeed I would submit that Leeds would find it difficult to actually accommodate the migration assumption which is w would be implied by sticking to the revised plan, mid-year estimate figure. I think that they would find it quite difficult to actually do that er without very many incursions into the greenbelt. Bradford, the position is not quite so stark. But nevertheless, they're very much as I see it, on the border. Er and the their U D P's just on deposit so got to go into it in a bit more detail yet. But it would seem to me that er there may be a marginal undersupply in Bradford on the basis of the current U D P and that is assuming that we we have the same balance between Bradford and between North Yorkshire as I am implying from my my particular figures. Erm I see nothing in the current Bradford U D P which suggests that they aren't erm majoring on urban regeneration, that they're doing they're doing exactly that. And so I would say that the whole thing, the figures that I'm proposing, er and the consequences for both Leeds and Bradford er would be in fact to maintain a balanced strategy for urban regeneration. And it does seem to me that erm I can't quite understand why it's possible or it seems to be an argument that you can accommodate a bit more development, squash a bit development into Leeds and Bradford and it doesn't matter very much. But you can not accommodate more development in North Yorkshire. those two things to me don't seem to be compatible. Certainly I think we're in very great danger of Leeds Bradford, if we start pushing things a great deal more. Erm it is part of our strategy of course erm that we are not er pursuing a hundred percent migration. So we are assuming a little bit more Bradford and Leeds but not erm la particularly large amounts. Do you do you want to comment on the lowest figure? Well the lowest figure, erm we've already got a level of commitment, we have to have three thousand de-allocations if that was the case, that does not seem to me to be correct. No. What happens to the housing market people if ? Erm that that I think relates to I think there are two important points t to make here in relation to forty one thousand. Erm I I said some the this this morning that in fact I think there would be serious affordable hou affordable housing problems er associated with that figure. And I think also we shouldn't overlook the em employment in Leeds that would be related to that. Not only employment in terms of the relationship between proposed industrial allocations and housing allocations, but the purest employment er problems of the construction industry as well. It's interesting that no no other than Tony M P Secretary of State, speaking at the conference, Building on Success, said that the erm construction industry accounts for a tenth of our National G D P. Er the industry is responsible for half our fixed investment and accounts for a third of our manufacturing base. It is therefore a critical component of our national economy and its good health is essential to our recovery from the downturn. I will take it from that that you play with it at this stage er of a recovery. Erm and erm I don't think that on the to go on about affordable housing as I did this morning, I don't think that in fact the affordable housing targets which the different authorities have and although I've only quoted four authorities I think, I think the other ones will be very much the same. I don't think that erm it will be possible to meet those affordable targets on the lower numbers. That simply people will miss out. They are not the only people who'll miss out, there'll be people at the lower end of the housing market who could afford to buy. Well if you take the the figures that It depends where they are to some extent. I'm sorry Yeah. On the affordable housing front? Or any other front. Any ot any other front. A on on on on the general issue,. But erm er on on on the figures that I've I've submitted, erm we've already got three of those five districts have got s fairly high affordable housing percentage requirements. And with Ryedale still at thirty eight percent, these are on my figures. Scarborough twenty one percent, probably getting towards okay. And York at twenty five percent. So meeting halfway, meeting that halfway house figure I think, erm would only seek to push up those figures. And you would only you you Yes you'd meet more of the affordable requirement no doubt, than you would at the lower figures, but in my view, you'd still be left with some fairly substantial problems in particular areas. What housing effects of the housing market ? You concentrated on ? Well in in in in in in some ways erm I've I've I've covered er some some of that point by referring to the to the importance of the construction industry. We have been and some would still have us believe, I think it's true, we're not out of the woods yet as far as er er recovery of the housing market is concerned. Er we've been in the longest recession in the housing market I think in memory. I think if not ever. Erm and there is still a need to supply houses to meet the needs of household formation. In the meanwhile while houses have not been built, people still go on forming households. And there is out there I'm very sure, a great un-met demand. Erm and if there is an undersupply, a serious undersupply, then sections of the market are bound to miss out. Erm whether whether that's just affordable or or whatever. And the ma market will become targeted to particular sectors and particular groups. And one effect of the recession has been, I've got to say, that a lot of the old that er house-builders have operated on, which are good for selling, which sites will sell well, etcetera a lot of those rules have been out of the window. There's a great air of uncertainty and erm we have to be very cautious about proposing housing numbers which mean there'll be very few new sites , which will be the implication of forty one thousand two hundred. There'll be very very few new sites being formed, the inevitable consequence of that will be to push land prices up. Land prices are already rising at the moment er in this region, even though house prices are not rising at a commensurate level. And so that will have its effect in the fullness of time. And certainly if you keep housing numbers in short supply, the only effect will be to push land prices even higher. Thank you sir, Stephen from . I think our view of the effects of numbers significantly lower than the ones that we've put to you, is first of all that there are a number of factors which planning cannot influence and will not influence. And I would include in those, the vacancy issue that we discussed this morning, so there will be more vacant dwellings whether it's a percent of thirty thousand or fifty thousand. There is the improvement in mortality. I don't think planning has any influence or would wish to have any influence on that. There is the tendency towards higher headship rates and more household formation. And I don't think planning will have much influence on that. So with one proviso, I would say that that households will form whatever number of dwellings you write into the structure plan, those households will form in North Yorkshire. So if they don't have sufficient dwellings to meet the requirements, two things and I would expect them both two things, would happen. First of all, and I put this purely in order of er semantics rather than priority. First of all I don't think local needs would be fully met, as you know I think very often the migrants are able to outbid local households in the market, so I don't think local needs will be fully met. and indeed in terms of the low figure of of of thirty one thousand it it's statistically conceivable that no local needs would be met. But I think the way that that would occur would be first of all I would expect to see an increase, a steeper increase than is already project I should say in concealed households. I would also expect to see as a result of local shortages, more sharing of dwellings, by households who have formed not the same of concealed households who haven't succeeded in . And I should say on that topic that we looked prior to this E I P at the implications for sharing of the paper that er Miss put before you in her personal capacity. And our best interpretation as far as we could tell from that of course that was that the implied increase in sharing, because sh assumes that households with dwelling was about between four and five times the present sorry nineteen ninety one level share in the county. And to give you a measure of what that would mean, it would be a return to the conditions of the late forties, early fifties as regards sharing in North Yorkshire is concerned. So there is a very considerable backward step. And that will be one of the implication lower figures. But that local needs heading is one heading, the other heading which I think would be unavoidable is erm on migration. I would expect to see the lower figures resulting in as indeed they themselves imply,lower migration movements to North Yorkshire and indeed I think the figures from er might end up by the end of the period as net outward movement from North Yorkshire to be achieved, given the level of commitments we have up front. And if we look at the implications er West Yorkshire which were touched on in the beginning of this part of the debate. It seems to me unavoidable that one of the consequences would be to take more greenbelt land in West Yorkshire. And in that sense the choice at this E I P is whether to use greenbelt in West Yorkshire, or non-greenbelt in North Yorkshire. And I think to an extent those two are two ends of the seesaw and is a straight er choice that has to be made. You'll not be surprised to find that in terms of national policy, I would have thought that was very clear if you were given that choice, what the policy should be. I'm not aware that it's national policy that greenbelt should be used for the sake of urban regeneration. I think that I would see the consequences of the lower figures as being twofold. Severe impact on local need, and also substantial impact on migration, with particular in West Yorkshire. Erm s s several points I'd like to make. Er it's been suggested by Mr from the H B F that as I understand his suggestion, that a lower provision of housing land in some way affects affordability or affects the er access to housing for the lower se lower ends of the lower income households. Erm there is no evidence Well I've seen no evidence, first of all to substantiate that claim, and in my opinion, all the evidence suggests that the key determinant of house prices and therefore land prices is the ration of income to the price of the property. And in fact housing is more affordable now, than it has been for twenty five or thirty years. When we are in as Mr himself agrees, the worst housing recession probably this this century. So I would seriously question that you can make the sort of relationship that is suggested here, between affordability and increasing the numbers. I don't think the link is proven and I would certainly like to see evidence to substantiate that suggestion. Getting back to the numbers, Mr says that if the number suggested by ourselves, through our client of thirty one K were er adhered to that it may well reduce the ability completely of locals to gain access to the housing market. Well I think the figures agree that the requirement for local need is sixteen thousand five hundred, about half the thirty one K suggestion. And again there is a suggestion put forward to support this theory that local people won't have access to housing, and the suggestion is that ou that migrants have the ability to outbid locals. Well I have no see no evidence for that suggestion,and I think if the panel are going to accept this suggestion, then evidence or some some sort of information should be put forward to to to to back it, because I don't accept that it's it's necessarily the case. Erm the the beginning and the end of this argument is about migration. There is enough land to provide for local needs, more than twice enough. It's about pr p provision for migration and what the policy should be for that. And that brings me to the point that was made er by Mr and others on the other side of the table, that the structure plan does have a policy of a continued reduction in migration. That is a policy of the approved structure plan. We're not talking about reviewing the structure plan, we're talking about an alteration to it. And there is no s support round the table so far for the H B F figure of fifty three K. As I understand the Leeds position, they want what they call a lev a level playing field, or to be aiming at the same goalposts that they've been aiming at for the last number of years. But that would only support forty six thousand two hundred. Which is the North Yorkshire structure plan unconstrained figure. So with those erm policy points and those questions about the ab ability of migrants to outbid locals, and the ac housing access issue, I would erm suggest that if they're to be accepted by the panel, then more information is . What do you feel indicates the County Council's proposals. Erm the figure the County Council have proposed in my opinion, doesn't achieve a sufficient level of reduction. It goes in the right direction in so far as it does aim to re to continue to reduction in migration, but it doesn't go far enough. And I take the view that the Unity Development Plans for Leeds and Bradford do tend to me to suggest that there is the ability to meet an increasing amount of need in within their own areas and that that should be reflected in a continually reducing er export if I can call it that, to North Yorkshire, and this morning we heard from Cleveland that Cleveland are making gallant efforts to er to er retain their economic er viability by retaining their population. So I would say that the North Yorkshire er figure in summary, goes in the right direction but not far enough. What is it that happens on the ground that in your view makes it not far enough? The release of green fields in Yorkshire for urbanization, when that l that housing could be provided by urban regeneration in the adjoining metropolitan areas. And to my mind that is a fundamentally flawed planning strategy. The release the release of green fields should only happen when there is no other solution. And here we have a county which is taking sixty percent of its housing requirement from outside its boundaries. When I am not convinced that those er the areas outside those boundaries which are in dire need of urban regeneration, could not accommodate a greater proportion over over the planned period. Bearing in mind, bearing bearing in mind Mr 's assessment of , how do you assess the realistic chance of actually . I don't think you I don't think you will be able to stop at that figure, I think that the allocation should stop at that figure, but there will be windfalls and there will be other er recycling of land that will take place that isn't already allocated. And it comes back to my point about the allocation of green fields and the there should be no more of that because there's already enough allocated. But I wouldn't for one moment suggest to the panel that windfalls and recycling of land shouldn't continue to take place. But if you recycle land already used by housing, you don't necessarily get any more or any fewer dwellings. Yes but you tend not to get recycling of housing land of housing, you tend to get recycling of housing land, new housing land from outworn industries, nonconforming use, that type of erm recycling is just what I had in mind. And that's what tends to happen. It's it's unusual these days bearing in mind the the government advice on planning policies for existing housing to be redeveloped. Unless of course it's er high rise housing housing in in in urban areas and of course in that in those scenarios you do get a big reductions in the number of . pitched at twenty one thousand, could . Means that provision has to be . No because section fifty four A and all section fifty four A says is that a decision should be made on a planning application, in accordance with the development plan. If the development plan said, Thou shalt not develop that green field, if it was not allocated in the development plan, then section fifty four A would er would work very well. Erm and of course section fifty four A does admit or taking into considera taking into account other material considerations. Erm for example, I have been involved in a site in North Yorkshire, er where it is proposed to build a hundred and sixty houses in Tadcaster. And the provision for the county is well over the allocations in the structure plan already, but the County Council, sent observations to the District Council to say, We're not going to object to this particular er windfall site coming forward for a hundred and sixty houses, because it's recycling existing urban land, and in that case we can set the policy to one side. So there is the ability to set policy to one side of the circumstances dictate. Sorry could you that again? What do you think that does for ? I think the credibility of the planning system is enhanced by the fact that decisions can be made on individual circumstances. That policy isn't a straitjacket. It's plann i Planning is now policy led yes, but but but er planning isn't a slave to policy. If policy can be set to one side then it is set to one side and I think it enhances the reputation of of the system. , Michael and Partners. I think my first point is that the answer to your question depends to some extent on what population what demographic forecasts prove to be most likely. Because the f the county's forty one thousand figure I I'll give you a different answer on th on the effect of that if the H B F's forecasts are the most accurate,. So it's I'm taking the the question in that light. If the bottom end of the population projections are implemented in terms of planning requirement. if the planning if if the requirements fall much below the demographic requirements, the implication is that migration could be controlled but it may be controlled by a mechanism which I don't think anybody really wants and that's by stimulating out migration in North Yorkshire. Because you are talking about net migration flows. To increase out migration will selectively erm encourage those people least able to compete probably the the the the younger section, the seventeen to twenty ei twenty four year age group which we already know are there's a net out migration flow. We'd encourage those to leave the county. Obviously the housing requirements should not be such as to generate harm to environmental interests. We've heard in introduction Mr Mr say that the County Council would not like to see housing requirements any lower than they have proposed. I take I take that to be that that is the bottom end of a of a range. Cos I I think there must be a range. The question of the relationship with other areas in the adjoining counties. I think that is more a question of distribution within districts than overall district levels. Harrogate and Hambleton for instance are large districts, they extend many miles from North to South, development concentrated around the metropolitan areas will draw out commuters. But there is a strict limit to the distance, well not a strict limit but commuting is sensitive to distance. So annotations in Central and Southern Hambleton would not have an effect on Cleveland. The in fact looking at Hambleton's figures, one can see that it's only really it's only really the top North West, I'm sorry the top North East. Erm Stoakesly, Hunten, Rugby area that does prove attractive to to communities. And I don't think the I don't think the the overall scale of that issue is one which needs to reduce the strategic requirement on Hambleton. That can be dealt with at a local plan level by distribution within the district. The same applies much to Harrogate as well. You're effectively saying that Yes. Mr . Yes thank you sir. Er just a points er I think it it you probably had this point clear in your mind anyway but there are different rules that apply as between West Yorkshire and Cleveland. North Yorkshire. One area's in in need of urban regeneration and pressing for growth, and one area's subject to a policy of restraint. So I don't think it's a case of geese and ganders, I think it's a case of distinguishing between the different strategic policies that apply. Erm I think this whole issue is going to boil down to the your assumptions on migration. If one goes to answer your question, to the top end of the range being put before you, the effect will be to release probably more than a thousand acres of greenfield land er for housing development purposes. And that I would suggest is not a policy that's consistent er for that with tempered restraint. Erm you will also in going for the higher end of the range, er be prejudicing the urban regeneration objectives of those neighbouring districts. Erm there are two further points that commit discussion just taking place. And one is about the effect of the reduction of a s the migration assumptions. It clearly will not take immediate effect, there is a lot of housing allocations and permissions in the pipeline as it were, so it will take some while for it to wash through the system. Er my final point sir is concern with perhaps a few emotional points being made to my right about the old and the infirm and the young not being able to afford houses. Erm this County Council is proposing to allocate significantly more housing for in migrants than for local needs. Er which in my view is quite a rarity. Erm there are other policies in any event which one can use at local and structure plan level to secure social housing provision if it's required. But I would also like to pick up the point that Mr said, there is no evidence to suggest there's a massive problem of the local residents of North Yorkshire er not being able to compete with people in other counties to the North and to the West. Er there's with no evidence of an oversupply, my suggestion is that the decision you must no firm house in mind you've several houses and there's one house without any lights on at all and it was night time, you may well go for that one first. Think we've all got the right idea. Mm. Hope it doesn't turn to crime There is another good way to find out whether there's anybody in you know ain't there? Telephone. does so and so live here, you No say no you've got the wrong That does happen. Yeah. That does happen. Not very often. Er what we're trying to do really is to try and stop the opportunis opportunist thief. Erm most burglars opportunist burglaries. There's not many people er do observations, or case the joint as you say. Happens, but they do try and go for bigger takings, I mean they'll not break into my house it won't be worth all that worth. It'll be a lot easier to go to work it's less, less hassle. Er so that. See opportunist they, they will not have a particular house in mind, they'll have, they'll just walk round till this one strikes them. Mhm. The mind, examine the way you, that you've done erm if you sort of apply that to your own house, you can actually cut down the chances of a burglary happening to you. Er I mean i it was done very well. The experiment's worked quite good, I was quite amazed. Quite common sense. Er burglar alarms. Is there anybody who would risk breaking into a house with a burglar alarm ? No. Wouldn't risk Not burglar not unless you know all about the wiring and you could take it off yourself. Yeah. No. So even if they weren't in and you to knock on the door, the burglar alarm would stop you? Mhm. Well it's bound to Yeah. wiring about it and you can take it off. Right. Cos look at I mean in our street, our area alarms going off. There've been smoke alarms Yeah. people still Mm. Well if if, if you were on a street then, if you were a burglar and there's a house there with a burglar alarm on Ah, but do you know whether it's a burglar alarm or a smoke alarm? Yes What from the ? From passing . Anybody going by. Do you know whether it's a burglar alarm or a smoke alarm? Only when it's ringing. Yes. Well, I mean it's a bell isn't it? Pardon? Th s er er burglar alarm's a bell. There's different sorts. Th there's different sorts and different sorts Is that I don't know what you mean wh what are you t when you're talking about smoke alarm, what do you mean exactly? Well Do you mean a bell on the outside of the house? No. I'm talking about inside bells now. It's inside. I mean they open the door and bell can go inside can't it? Just alarm. Yeah. Right, so if we're talking about burglar alarms with the bell box on the outside of the house. Erm that would put most of you off. But If the wiring's running outside the outside the person Well could it er British Standards say that wiring shouldn't be external so we're okay there. Right,British Standard, yeah. Well isn't there a way there pushing chimney? Down a chimney? Yeah, W in the box? In the bo on the box to stop it from Ye well it can be done, yeah. Yeah. You know, you know Yeah but i it has been done that, but Oh they it at the Spar, weren't they? The other morning at half past two. I know. rang for the police. And but they'd go gone. Yeah it can be done. It can yeah. That's what they're doing put It's er a kind of foam that they use for insulation. Yeah, yeah. It's in an aerosol. Yeah. Er the the The dam the That's right. Mm. But the er but it can't be done on modern alarms now because the bell boxes they use are anti-foam and they probably have two or three alarm boxes. And the, the . The criminals find their way round something and then the, then the alarm companies stop it from happening. Now the alarm companies are always one behind but er if we're talking about houses, not many burglars would try a, a house with an alarm. Now you, you could in theory just put a bell box on the house to put people off. Er if you were a fairly decent criminal though you, you may well have a look through the windows to see if you can see any detectors on the wall, just to confirm it, because by now you'd be thinking that a lot of these are dummies. Aye look at, look at the hall over in village. and they when the main street . Some time or other you hear that court bell ringing don't you? Yeah. Do you know whether it's a fire alarm or not? Nobody knows No. Oh you hear it, it's rung for as much as twenty minutes while I've been walking round. Or the shops in Yeah. but you don't do anything about it. Okay then so Just along those If it's a fire bell, tell me ring the fireman If it's a, an alarm Well I, I'll talk about continuously no real point then, putting a bell box on. Not having alarm so you put a bell box on. Just a bell box. What with some villains that will only go to houses with something like that, because they think, they see that you've got something worth having. Well I've heard Otherwise you wouldn't have it. I've heard this quite a lot, it's a, it's a common It depends what kind of burglar you're talking about. I mean the days of the black mask and blue and white jersey have gone. It's designer suits and bloody Stocking these days. I've not known I mean you can't tell a burglar I've not known many burglars break into houses with alarms systems. No I don't er And this, this comment about that they think you've got something in the house worth pinching doesn't really come into it. But some, some will say that in bravado. If you worked for the probation service you'll know Yeah well that's what it is Well I burglar alarm cost a, the whole system costs a lot of money to set up, so if you've got in here it's not going to put that expense to set that up. Well actually I think they're very cheap, burglar alarms, they're about three hundred and fifty four hundred pound. When you think about the wiring involved, and the, the hours it takes to put one in I think that they're good value for money. Hmm. It's about the same price as a video. Oh they've come down in price from when I'm talking about,when they first come first out, they were quite a lot, a lot more I reckon the easiest way expensive than that. Yeah. and I would do it is to go during the day, knock on somebody's door and pretend I'm selling something. And then say I want to go to toilet and then I should pinch something Yeah. Mm. And it's done. unless they wanted to get And then you could be going in It's just a deterrent the same as what's on cars. Yeah. Only a deterrent isn't it? Well they will, they will if they really want to get in. What what I'm saying if you, if you put yourself in the position of a burglar, and y you're already, you've done it, you're already making choices. Mm. You're already saying I'm not doing that one because Mm. Mm. I would do a house like this. Mm. Mm. Well what you've got to do now is think about your own house and in the same way you've just thought about it and say what is there about my house that would attract somebody to try and break into it. And then think how can I stop that from happening. Now the burglar alarm's probably the, the biggest thing, but we can't all afford the, I mean I haven't got one and I'm a crime prevention officer, I mean by rights I should have one but I haven't. So it, it won't suit everybody, you might not want, in my case I don't particularly want to live with a burglar alarm. Er because you have to switch them on and off and all this business. I'm, I'm sure I'd change my mind if I was burgled. The very next day I'm sure there'd be er someone round our house putting one up on the wall S s so w if we use the same thing that we've just done on our own house and say how can we stop it from happening, might not get a burglar alarm. It might, it might be though cutting the hedges back a little bit. It might be doing things at night time, leaving the lights on, to make it look as though you're in. Drawing curtains. If you're away on holiday and can't do that getting a neighbour to do it for you, to look after your house, shut the curtains at night and opening them during the day. Er it might be putting a sign up on the, on the fence saying beware of the dog, it might be having a gravel drive. Er it might be having someone making sure the out of the way, to make sure it looks as those there's mil that there's someone in, in or out the house. Some people even leave radios on in the house, so that there's not only the light on, but if somebody does walk up the drive intending to knock on the door to test it, before they get to the door they can hear a noise, they turn around and go back. It might be having lights on like you mentioned. So when someone walks up with the intention of breaking in a light comes on, I mean at one time, it's not the same now, but at one time when these lights with the detectors first came out, nobody actually knew whether they were switched on or not. People had gone up to a house and been knocking on the door waiting for someone to come because the light had come on and they thought there must be somebody in because they switched the light on when they saw me come up the drive, and these are visitors. So it might put, might have put some burglars off, that's not the same case nowadays cos they're so common. But the thing is if you're walking up er the driveway of a house, you don't want to be caught and you don't want to be seen and you, you think you're under cover of darkness and then the big halogen floodlight comes on, puts you in a spotlight next door. So we're all, we're all thinking very well as criminals. Er it's just a matter of swapping it round now and thinking about your own home and i like you mentioned, it's not, if you are in you're, you're, you're still likely to be, well not likely, you still could be er targeted and the burglar who just opens a door and reaches in and takes Mm. something. Yeah, yeah. So it's important to keep doors locked. The only thing you haven't mentioned is, is locks on doors yet Mm. er and I'll just run through this for about five minutes and then any questions and we'll go. But if you c if there's a burglar who got to the house, you've selected your house and everything's okay. How would you break in? What's the best way in? Door? Window Glass cutter. You use a glass cutter. nine times, nine times out of ten the, the er door the back door or the front door has got a great big pane of glass on top of it. Yeah. Is the top, I mean I broke, had to get in my own house when I locked myself out once when I'd been in the garden and I, I just got in by leaning through the top window and opening the bottom window, so now I always lock the bottom windows, I don't bother locking the top one I open it So you've got locks for the windows? So I lock the bottom window. Yeah. So that if even if they reach through they're going to have to break the lock just to get in. So if you were a criminal then you would look for an open window to reach through t to open another window? To reach in yes I wouldn't I couldn't Yeah. do it. I, I You'd use a glass cutter in the door? Mm. Or a window, would you use it on? Pardon? Would you use a glass cutter in a window? Or just a door? Yes, if necessary yes. It's a er it's a means of getting in isn't it? Why would use a glass cutter and not just smash the window? Well it so much noise doesn't it? noise I'm not Just scratch Yes. All you want to do is, all you wanted to do just strike it in middle of glass go round it just I lived in my house for going on for a year before I realized that all you had to do was put your hand through my letter box, reach up and you could take, open the Yale lock because I'd been there a year I locked myself out and I thought the only thing I can do is try and get in by putting my hand through. It was as easy as anything, and for a long time I, I felt well at least I can get in that way and then I thought oh maybe I should, you know doing, doing anything about it, but now I always go out of the other door Yeah. and bolt that one because I don't want anybody to be there when I get back. I don't mind if they've been, but if they're waiting or It's, it's funny because we, we were having this conversation before we came in weren't we? Yeah. Er someone tells him that, a policeman tells him the best way to look at it is if you were locked out your house Yeah. y your key's in the inside, how would you get in? Yeah I mean You're not supposed to leave your key in anyway. Well no but er I think we're, we've all got an idea how we'd get into our own house if we were locked out. Mm. Well I haven't really because I've got double glazing. Yeah. Well I couldn't get in my house cos I'd have to undo You could really get in most houses if you really wanted If I locked my door at night,I was to take the key out, never leave the key in never leave the key in Mine's got Mine's locked and I've got a chain on as well. Mine's Right. My wife will er at night time she locks all the doors, she takes all keys out. Yeah, you're supposed to do it. She takes all key out. piece of paper shove a key out, pull it out. That's it. I've still, I've, I've actually something that's even more stupid than that. I've got two back doors, there's a storm porch and the door to the house and they're both locked and bolted. I've even got five lever mortise locks. Yeah. We've got two dogs, we've got double glazing, and the front door's got a five lever mortise lock. Yeah. And we've got no hedge on . We've got out back, it's all sheltered,next door's got more for years to put them down the front, my wife won't let me for the same reason she says if you blind yourself then any bugger can come in. Yeah. But our front door is never locked. There you are. We go to bed and I say, you locked the front door? Mm. Could But I don't think they'll get in, as I say there's two dogs I'm always first in bed at night, all those windows. Can I Twenty minutes later she A lot of people point in, it's quite important that you, you made when you said using glass cutter erm and you said about reaching through open windows. And I asked why wouldn't you break a window and you said noise. Is there any, any other reason you can think of why somebody wouldn't break a window? Why you wouldn't break a Why you wouldn't break a window to break a window, why you'd go to the trouble of using a glass cutter If you broke a window you could cut yourself, Yeah yeah, that's about it really. In my experience and er it's backed up by research, a burglar will, will only break glass if it, if they can reach through to open a window, in much the same way that Mm. you would look for an open window. Mm. Er they don't particularly like to make a, a noise, but some, some do if it's quick. If someone has to break a window and knock out all the glass it makes even more noise. I mean it's falling on the floor. Erm so if they do something with, with windows that makes them actually the, the open way they can break in is to break all the glass out, and the way you would do that is to fit a window lock. So even if they made a little, if they've got the glass cutter, made a little round hole then reached , still couldn't get the window open they'd be forced to break the whole lot and make more noise. Er they can be quite effective. It's only a little thing, putting window locks on, on, on, you wouldn't buy a house now without a lock on the door, but a lot of people still buy houses without locks on the windows. I'm afraid that, you know, those days are limited. Eventually we'll all have locks on windows fully insured are you? For burglary if you haven't got locks on Well your windows. with certain of the, the insurance companies, that's true, yeah er it's always worth checking. I've got to mention insurance, cos now you're in the Neighbourhood Watch you get a discount on your house contents. So next time your insurance is due, tell them that you're in the Neighbourhood Mm. Watch. Yeah. Any sort of final comments anyone? Er er I don't think after going through everything we've said, I think we've all got the sort of ideas that we could all make good criminals, er we know what to do. If we know what to do we can all look at our own houses and decide how we can alter them in not too expensive ways to make it a bit harder for the criminal. Erm and r really that's all crime prevention's about. It's all about looking after your house is about, using the neighbours, using the knowledge you've got to make it more difficult. Any When, when this was first suggested erm was couple of questions came back and Selwyn and I spoke about it, was the fact that w are there or would there be any recriminations for people who kind of belong to any Neighbourhood Watch, like a brick through a window or, or, because anybody who saw erm that programme on television a fortnight, Esther Rantzen, and Neighbourhood Watch was mentioned. Was that, was a in the front garden? Was that I only came into the room and I switched it on and i there were quite a lot of recriminations with people who Yeah it were Manch was it Manchester? I don't know I just watched a clip And she said you're nothing but a load of old busybodies and how dare you and oh the language. Because Yeah. these people actually set up a Neighbourhood Watch and you know any reason Well you shouldn't get that where we are It wasn't everybody was in agree I mean all them were all in agreement. Yeah it wasn't a very good part Everybody agreed of Manchester it was Yeah. an awful part of Manchester. Erm Yeah it's it certainly is an issue that would er worry a lot of people in a Yeah. inner city. next door. Exactly that's Er which is better place big window as far as I can see. Not in the big window? No Why? sign their names and Mm. everything. Yeah. There'll be no having said, next It's a deterrent, ignore it they think it, that it's just they Yeah. ignore it don't they? They don't do anything Yes especially cos you don't know what it's for half the bloody time, she doesn't know where she is. She ignores you whatever Right erm she just Well that makes Can I, can I sort wind ? I've given you these Yeah. green books. Er they go into crime prevention in, in a fairly big way. Have a read through them at your leisure. Er the blue book is just a guide for yourselves as cos Neighbourhood Watch members. And stickers are for the windows. Do take some more for your neighbours people who couldn't be here today. Er distribute them round. The thing about the Neighbourhood Watch is that everyone in the area is a member whether they really want to be one or not to be honest. Er just living in it makes them a member. I mean there's no, there's no fee or anything like that involved, so the fact that you're all seen as members will cut down on any recriminations you might have. I don't think that's a real threat in Farnsfield to be honest. The worst we've had recrimination-wise with Neighbourhood Watch schemes, is some people bend the signs and spray, spray paint them but I think you could live with that. Er but I, I don't think that'll happen in Farnsfield. You never know,some somebody walking home from the pub one night with a bit too much, too much to drink might just bend the sign. But that happens to all street signs, Mm. Mm. occasionally. It's just that it does som sometimes seem temptation. Right erm I, I do wish you well with your scheme Thank you. Er you've got a lot of work to do if this is got here tonight, er just s spread the word, tell them it's not as bad as they probably think it is, there's no patrols needed or anything like that. And er I'd like to sort of thank Jan on your behalf and all the other people for taking the trouble to, to organize this scheme and get things rolling because it, it will be a little financial benefit to you when you renew your insurance, so thanks for that, Jan. And er, unless there's any last questions I think that's about it. No I want to get back to see the sheep at nine o'clock. Thanks ever so much for coming in That's alright, I've en I've enjoyed I'm just sorry that a few more people didn't turn, at least there's more Yeah. than two . To be to be honest i I, I, it's been, the presentation I've given tonight has been slightly different, it's the first time I tried it and it was really successful. Mm. I don't know how you felt about it. do that with two hundred people No. in the No. Er it has to be a small group. Er It's not the fact we live on a council estate, more likely to have No it's not fact that normal go up the private estates, this is probably your first time on a council estate,the bloody hell it's come from. I know Actually I checked out all about who was walking down to the telephone kiosk and asked all the questions about the area so that I Well you know. anyway that. Yeah they are. Yeah. I was in the Lion, fortnight ago, Sunday dinnertime and lads had been on this er bike ride, you know for some children Mm. They parked their two bikes outside the round door over at the Lion, came in, one ordered two drinks and he said I'll just nip across to phone. Alright, come back and the had gone. aren't they ? I mean there's a shop just here agri erm does agricultural machinery and repairs and that. He gets broken into regular. Mm. Yeah,gets broken into regular, cigarettes and booze. Well when I was here they were dealing with somebody er for stealing salmon out of Yeah the Co-op. Co-op. Yeah, yeah. And that was a real Oh it happens regular down this Oh well that's because nobody takes any notice about That, that was, that was a real big job, the salmon thefts, it were quite funny,they were going in all sorts of shops, just stealing salmon. Yeah. That's all they stole. The, the salmons were expensive I didn't realize how expensive it was. wee you see that they, they lost a lot of Yeah well this before . big display up of salmon, you know he took allowed to take as much as you can. My pleasure. I'll introduce you to W P C Heather who's the local crime prevention officer. I won't introduce the rest but th th , they're all linked and I gather that er you're gonna be replacing Heather in her role in the near future. Yes sir. Thank you. And don't worry if you see a tape recorder going er, it's actually being recorded, but just forget that it's there. And we hope to be able to show you a video. We'll make that up as we go along. But with that, over to you Heather. Right. Okay. Thanks very much. Ted. Those of you who snore will get ! Okay? Right. Crime prevention covers a multitude of things er and we'll bring it back to what actually effects you. And I think that has to be in our homes. We all like to feel safe and secure in our homes, and, but do we actually think about security unless we become a victim How do we go about securing up our homes? Do we know the areas that we should be concentrating on? Most of you come from er around this area and I would, and I would probably refer to this erm, as our local area because that is . For Harlow and the subdivisional area that we actually concentrate on, that takes in forty, or at least, no it doesn't. Our crime rate erm, for burglaries is about thirty two percent and that's home. burglaries. Most people that are the victim of burglaries erm decide to do their security . But it's knowing the right things. You can see lots of different security products on the market and . It doesn't have to in actual fact. But you start, or we like to start at the front door of what we call . Now how many amongst you have just got that on your front door? A lock like that? Yeah? Nothing else? Just that? That's it. . Okay. This in actual fact is called an automatic free latch you all know it by Yale, Legg, whatever the company make is. It isn't actually a security lock. It never was designed to be one. It's an easy lock for you to come in and out of your houses with. This is only as good as the screws holding it in place in your front door. A simple credit card slipped down there is sufficient rebate between the door frame, and the actual lock itself can open one of these types of locks showing no signs of forced entry. You won't even know somebody's been into your houses. Most houses are fitted with these but it's up to you as individuals to actually look and see, er, if that's sufficient. If that is all you've got even with a double lock, locking action it is very easy to open up. What we'd like you to do and to consider, and I'll come on to replacement soon, is to consider supplementing it with one of these types of locks. Many different makes. Chubb is probably one of the most commonest. This is a mortice lock. A five lever mortice dead lock. This is a security lock. You would probably see them on front doors and perhaps some of you have already got them, where about a third of the way up is a little brass plate, and it's an integral lock that's fitted into the door. The reason that these are a security lock is there are security features built into it. The leverage on a lock depends on the, the type of combination. This one is a five lever, which is probably the most standard. It is a made to a British standard which you can tell when you buy anything like that by the kite mark on the side. This one has got five levers and the levers are these things here that you can see in the casing. They're set into a set combination. There are up to a thousand differs of keys bought with these types of locks. So every one in a thousand key, might actually fit this type of lock but it's highly unlikely. It's got a steel bolt with two steel rollers in there, so that if, even somebody tried to hacksaw their way through that it will just slide along as soon as. They're very, very to open. They won't, the burglar is more likely to seriously damage the frame than the actual lock. They cost about we reckon seventeen to twenty five pounds to buy and they have to be fitted to a door one and three quarter inches thick. If you're good at do-it-yourself, then fine, have a go, if you're not this particularly applies to the gents, swallow your pride and get somebody in to do it for you. Please do not do er what a young man did the other day went to his house, he was the victim of a burglary, he very proudly announced that he'd fitted one of these locks to his front door when we saw how he'd fitted it, he'd actually chiselled out the majority of the side of his door in and filled it up with Polyfilla! Erm, we did tell him that obviously he'd That might help Yes! He also fitted it at the top end of the door. Now, if you've got nowhere else, erm, at the bottom end of the door to fit it, that's fine, but as a matter of a preference, Crime Prevention like to see them fitted a third of the way up the door, that is where our thieves put the boot in, and thieves will work to pressure points, to leverage points they come equipped, or most of them don't come equipped, because obviously if they're walking along the street and a police officer sees them, you know, pull them over and start to talk to them, most of them will actually er use the tools from the back garden or or things they find lying around to help themselves in. Now that's all very well having one of those, if you've got a nice solid wood door to fit it to, but if you're looking at the new replacement P V C doors erm, afterwards you can't fit that type of lock because the actual structure of the door won't take it. So how do you secure up one of those doors? Any of you got that problem? Yes. Well well actual fact, unless it's done, the security's fitted at the time of manufacture you can actually serious damage the framing. And I wouldn't suggest you, you tamper with it, er, because if you do damage the framework of it you've got no redress from the company. Some aluminium doors will take extra security device. But that is where you need to get a a specialist locksmith in to actually assess the framing of the door. Cos on the new P V C doors, most of the security is down one side, you've got what I call multi-locking surface. Some of you, you might have seen them, where you've got a number of bolts that shoot into the top from the side of the frame and the whole thing operates at the turn of a key. It's very good if that, that's in place, but you have to also make sure that the, the screws on the hinge side are fitted correctly as well. Cos I had an occasion where I had a, a replacement door it was my own house and they ripped off half the screws. And if you think of a the main fabric of them, they're quite flimsy. And there have been occasions now where our local police, certainly, and that er frees areas and just knock the back of the . So, do choose very carefully if you're thinking of having replacement glazing and doors. Every house has weak areas you can probably identify them yourselves, and so can burglars. If I was gonna break into a into, you know, my house how would I do it? And there are obvious points to watch isn't there? The back and the sides for instance. Burglars like to work unseen and unheard. They like the coverage of foliage to, to work at night. As I say, they will use the things that are in your back garden. So security extends not only from, the home, but onto the garden shed as well. If you've got a flat roof for instance, if you've got sun loungers in the side, well you just stack those up to the level of, levels of your . And one of the most common entrances into houses is by a small fan light window. As soon as they can get their head and shoulders through, they're in!double glazing conservatories is one of the best deterrents. . Security is like a game of chess, and our thieves are sort of like one move ahead of us, or vice-versa as the case might be. The window locks, which there are many, many different types to choose from are now not the deterrent they were. And if you have, are sort of screwed on and they're put underneath erm, until you sort of,type locks cos anything else . But how do you be really , how do you not scare yourselves from going out?gonna return to your homes and that everything's going to be left as it was? It's a question of having to deal with the truth. Making it as difficult as possible for them to come in by setting up barriers doing things, perhaps a at night, putting like some timer switches in the rooms that you're likely to be sitting in. You'd be surprised the number of people that will leave, still, just the one singular light in the hallway. Nobody sits in their for eight hours of an evening! So put it i , put a light on in a room that you will actually be in. Adjust the curtains. You cannot odds against the free newspapers coming through your doors, they're a pain to all of us! But we as crime prevention officers regularly meet with erm the newspaper people to say can you make sure your staff push them through the letter boxes and they assure us that the er, the next thing on their list to prioritize but it doesn't happen. And you must have gone through in your own neighbourhood where you see papers sticking out of letter bo boxes, milk left on the front door step. They are the tell-tale signs that the someone is not in. An extension of that is good neighbourhood. Are any of you involved in Neighbourhood Watch? Mm. Yes Offer that to you, do you think they neighbourhood work, watch works? Er before, before they set it up really. Yes. You might get the o , the odd one or two that are always looking out their windows and lo , they would do that in any case. No I, I don't really se That's a good idea I don't necessarily think it does. I, inadvertently went out of the house to go to , shut the door and realized I'd left my cars in the house. The only window open was at the back , so I had to break into my own house through there, I managed it. And, full expecting at any time perhaps to hear the er siren, sort of police car, but there wasn't any. No. Erm alright perhaps somebody said, you know, what's going on there, I wouldn't be surprised Cos you were Yeah. But I I'm I was rather disappointed that nothing had happened. Unfortunately Neighbourhood Watch is only as good what people Yeah. doing about it. Erm, that is joint effort, not only with yourselves, but for the police as well. And when you've got a good Neighbourhood Watch this is so, and you'll find that they are very efficient. We've had some good successes with them. It's also, depending on how much information you get because it should be a two way er communication. Most Neighbourhood Watches should supply regular news letters and information via local beat officers. And if that doesn't happen in your watches then that's something that needs to be addressed. Er, on an average here we sent out a newsletter once every month and we have things called a crime line which is an answerphone service updated every week with all of our crimes on it. So people have rung in on this direct line to find out what's going on and things appertaining that could be useful to them. And we found that it's starting to erm pay dividends. But it took us a long time to actually get to that stage because er, the police are at fault, the police launch these schemes and they go away and say get on with it and off we go And no follow up. no follow up. And it's a fault that we recognized. So if I can just break it down. The best deterrent against house burglaries at the moment is an alarm system. But actually, even with an alarm system you must have gone through where you've heard alarms ringing all day and nobody's been . Er if it's at night time it annoys you, cos if all ring your neighbours they're not gonna be so friendly if your alarm's ringing forever and a day and you know, it's disturbing your sleep. It's important if you consider having an alarm you cultivate your neighbours. You don't have to tell them your business, but what you do have to say is, I've got an alarm system, an audible system, so bells only, if you hear it going off can you ring the home station? It might be a bit more than that and can actually scare off. If you don't tell anybody nobody's going to react to that until it starts to annoy them, because most people think that everybody else is going to do something about it. It's like the car alarm, isn't it? You hear them going off. The only time we really react to them is when, perhaps, it's on our car we don't them to disturb anybody and you're trying to fumble about with your keys and switch the thing off. If you've got an alarm which is faulty and repeatedly goes off then, nine times out of ten, you ought to switch the thing off in the first place. And I think there was a local radio article er a couple of days ago that said that car alarms do not work any more house alarms do providing you've got good neighbours to respond to it. The prices of alarms, as well, you'd be quite surprised they do not range from a thousand. It might cost you a thousand pounds if you live in a a huge detached house and in the back of building you've got lots of rooms. But the average of hou , price for a house alarm ranging from about two hundred and seventy five pounds. Now if you had to have all the locks changed in your house, that probably come out on an even . A true locksmith is quite expensive. But, the responsibility for your own house is down to you. It's something that not a lot of people take notice of, as I say, until they become a victim of it. Or it might be your neighbours have become victims of crime and you suddenly see it could happen to you. Yeah, sorry I was going to ah er do, do you find that er the criminals are not taking notice of alarms off now because they know that people will be House alarms or car alarms? Er, house alarms. A , the house alarms I mean a I think thought initially that maybe maybe alarms, okay you can come and go, but erm Yeah. Most thieves are not in that league. They would rather go and burgle a house that isn't alarmed, erm because they don't know what type of alarm you've got there. Mm. Yes they can erm, distinguish between what I call a do-it-yourself alarms and th the recognized companies. Yeah. But at the end of the day they aren't in that league cos most thieves are opportunists they seize a common opportunity that is presented to them by or it could be they've actually just watched her go out and more of a chance . But if they set it off without, without noticing that you've gone like . They are That's likely to be, they're not gonna go, they're gonna, say the people next door, they're not gonna take any notice of it. No. Most Not most of the time That's right. Most of the time actually, if they do set them off, they scarper. They don't want to be around. Erm they don't want to draw attention to themselves. There are many different ways that they operate. I mean, one of the commonest things we have in this area is with the bogus officials who pretend to be something they're not. And none of us like to thing we've been conned. It happens so easily. You know, the water board er er it's all the same ones that we hear on th on the television, and it still happens! They still get away with it. Now, the classic example is from water boards, they'll have two people and they'll say, can we test your water pressure please? One will stay with you all the time watching what he's doing and the other one goes upstairs , while he's left alone, and in that short space of time they can actually . And . They nab easily saleable items that they can push out through boot sales, that type of thing, where they can really make the money. So how can you, what can you do to protect your ? Any ideas? Well I I think one of the greatest deterrents that one can have is the copper on the beat. You never see Yes. one! No. I think we're talking about We never see our own homes. Well But we It is a deterrent really. Well I know but I'm talking about, with break ins, I mean, people are a a I think are getting on with it and there's no deterrent for the A lone beat officer, as you call it, I think it has erm a cosmetic effect to be honest with you. Oh I think it does! Erm people tend to relate back er and think that in theory it's a nice welfare thing, and it's nice for the community, and they do sterling work, don't get me wrong, because I think they are a vital part of a community but, how much of a deterrent they are er, we are, we are unable to measure. And i it's not where, you've got the case where beat officers before erm, used to be able to clip erm people round the ear and things like that, they're not allowed to do that now, those days have long gone. But I, I think And erm there's a psychological as aspect in some so much that if they think that a policeman is gonna walk round the corner er, they're not so keen on doing it. Yeah. Well But I mean, we we've got a situation where we are, I mean, our estate's quiet, very quiet and and, you know, you get the impression that, you know, they can do it without fear or favour, you know,th they know that no one 's going to disturb them it's very quiet there Mm. and we we've always thought that, you know, to have a beat officer that was going around that could perhaps turn up at any time, would at least be some deterrent in so much that Yeah. the people think that they can do it undisturbed. Okay. They do, and that's what they, I mean, but they could also wait until he went round that corner and then go and burgle a house. Right. That's the other thing, they'd quite often would work to what we call But I mean,su surely that that's better than none at all? It is. Unfortunately, and it, perhaps it's the wrong choice of words, but beat officers are in actual fact, a luxury at the moment because if you call the police Yeah. you want a police to come as soon as possible, and you want to, to deal with it because it's a priority to you. Now police forces have to grade their to to things, we get the immediate response, the nine nine nine calls, and then so on. Where beat officers come into play is where you've got the non-urgent, what we call, the traffic, the non-urgent jobs, erm, where people can afford, maybe a couple of hours, it might be that they have to wait until the beat officer gets on duty could be a day or so's time and they they do do an awful lot of work, and it's an ongoing thing. Erm if you just liken it, I mean I was a beat officer here for eight years and the sorts of things that you'd come on duty erm to see, are you may, you might get the nutty woman, who who er, you reoccur and you have to go and see her and you ge , erm, but all the shift members can then pass that to the beat officer. It might be the domestic disputes. I, I take what yo you say because I I'm in favour of beat officers, but Yeah. most people want a quick response, so they would want then, the police officers in the cars that can get there within half an hour, at the latest to deal with their parti , particular problem. And as I say, it's it's not measurable to find out how much of a deterrent they are. I mean, they don't just sort of walk there, they have school visits and things like that to do, as well. So they are in touch with their community and they do for the most part, know what's going on, on their beat. But I mean, we have got nine beat officers for the whole of the Harlow Town area and just th , this area this is the start of what we call our beat eight this is the boundary along Southern Way, and that goes down as far are familiar with the area of Staple Tye most of you? It's quite a distance. All this side of the road is one officer's area that they have to cover on foot. See we we have an awful lot of problems, I mean, not only the question of breaking into one's home things like, car parking or things of a very high accident risk whereas, if we had a beat officer, at least we could set up some sort of local liaison, in so much that we could tell him about our sort of problems, and perhaps between us, resolve them. But we haven't yet But have you found out , have you got a beat officer? No. I've never seen one. But have you found out whether you've actually got one? They reckon there's supposed to be one allocated, but no one 's ever seen him. Why don't you ask to speak to him? We'll have to. Mm. We'll have to. See, it also takes members of the public to phone in. Yeah. People are quite often scared and think they don't want to bother the police we are human beings, we only bite on Thursdays, we're regularly fed and watered erm but, at the end of the day we But, there i there is a general consensus of opinion that if a, a policeman a happens to venture onto our estate, the instant reaction is, quick! Get a camera! Yeah. I mean I'd be a very rich woman And it's a general , it's a general consensus That's right. of opinion It is. unfortunately, nearly everybody says exactly the same. And we all believe each and every one of us, that if there was a, a much er, stronger police presence,i if I mean, a bobby Yeah. it would help a great deal. At least it would give us some sort of contact. We have got a ludicrous situation in our estate because it is very quiet. Whereabouts do you live? Up at Shenfield Right. Where, unfortunately, ladies er, won't go out of a night time because they're frightened whereas, we're looking for a little bit of a reassurance. Someone we can speak to, you know. True, I take your point, I mean I, perhaps I could dig a little bit deeper and find out what the Dickens is going on, you know! But we never ever se , we never ever see a policeman. But that also is the case, I mean er er, a lot of time th the actual design of our houses doesn't lend itself for us to actually look even if you're you're permanently looking out the window. I mean I can , have to say It's true. Our our our living quarters are on the back At the back. Yeah. That's right, so you wouldn't see anyone. Our bedroom's are on the front. You know. So Neighbourhood Watch really goes out the picture. The only thing that we do, and we've always done it without Neighbourhood Watch, we always make a point of telling one another when we're gonna be away for any period of time. That's just an extension from that, although it is basically neighbourhood watch Oh yes! Same sort of thing really. isn't it? Same sort o , but it is difficult when you're allied to a neighbourhood watch, when the living quarters are on the rear of the the accommodation. That's right. And it, it is, and We can't see what's going on there. because be being separate from all of you, and to make sure that your you know, because your problems are gonna be your neighbours problems. Yeah. Let's face it, we're quite selfish in the fact that we want to ensure that the area that we live in is safe for us and not too concerned that three or four estates down the road unless it starts to affect us . We don't want the problems on our own doorstep cos when the chips are down, we like to go home, and we like to feel safe and if somebody's entered your premises as an intruder then all of a sudden your security been taken away. It takes an awful long time for you to regain that and to feel safe in your own homes. Mm. So, if you do nothing else today, I'd like you to go home and assess the risk areas on your own individual houses. And have you actually ? If you haven't, then, you ought to phone your local beat officer and get him to come along and give you a survey I , I, I have phoned the police on numerous occasions and I must say, there isn't a great deal of response. Will, oh, it's all the response I get, we're far too busy we haven't got the manpower you know, er Well eventually they will have. a and this, this happens, you know. And that's the time to tackle it. I mean, I could come up I've even, I've even with the same excuse as that. I even sat on the local erm committee wi with the police authority, you know, and er we've got all sorts of promises but nothing that has ever materialized. When we query it, lack of manpower, lack of resources, lack of money. Well, we've got more police officers now than we've ever had before, we're not gonna get any more because, I mean, Essex Police Force, is quite a a rich one but I think, sort of, on recruitment, they've alre , probably due to get about fifty extra officers but that's . Which doesn't sound a lot from, er such a rural county, erm, but I mean, you know, obviously erm that is quite a lot, in terms because you are the people that are having to pay for it. Yeah. Do you think perhaps the problem is that, through no fault of their own, they spend far too much time in the police station doing other work perhaps, than going out on the beat? They're trying to cut that down, I mean, we have now, what is called, station officer's assistants and most police forces have them where they're civilian employees who do certain jobs to relieve the P C so that he can go back out onto the streets. Yeah. Compiling reports and goodness knows what else! Unfortunately , every thing you do in police force has got to be Gotta have reported. Yeah. And, that, it hasn't changed, in a very long while. Well I mean I'm er that wasn't meant as a criticism No. that was meant as, as a bit sympathy if you like, you know th But erm yeah sort of, the things that they have to do apart from fighting crime! Yes, but then Then I mean, you know there are things that we need to address in-house, to make sure that we give you er, an efficient service. And, like you say, if you're not Yeah. getting the response, if you're getting that type of excuse that comes out, then that's when you need to go back to them and say, well hang on, this is not good enough! I want a response! Alright, I'm prepared to wait depending you won't wait on a, a nine nine nine call, if it is Mm. an urgent call because that's got to take priority erm, but for other responses, then follow it up, don't just Yeah. accept it. Well I, I, as I say, I did follow it up and in fact, I even went to a committee where I sat and spoke to the er the police face to face and they made all sorts of promises but nothing materialized. Oh well, you'll have to stake it out again. Now I did bring a film along for you see and I'm hoping that it's going to work. But it just highlights some of the points erm it is humorous, so I hope that you enjoy it. And, it just shows you how easy it is to leave signs for the thief to tell him that we're out. This is where the technical bit always goes wrong even when Now is that done, that's tuned it right? Yeah. Try channel three. Going to switch it off . It's normally eight. . . That's right. I don't think we should put them through. Course it's a , talking, the only thing I can say, what you're saying about your erm problem in your area that, do you know if there's any crime actually committed on your estate? Is there a lot of crime Oh no! No! We don't get a lot No. really. I think we've, being a target, we've lived in which is since nineteen seventy three, I think we've had about three break ins. So no It's quite small really. which, which goes to show that maybe the officer, er saying maybe, I'm only throwing suggestions over there, cos I don't know Shenfield Yeah. that well, maybe the officer, the local beat officer has got a problem estate that he has to pinpoint and has to be there, or an area where the crime is being committed to try and deal with He's probably up in our estate! that, or, prevent that, whereas he knows that little estate round the corner, I know they look after themselves. Well why, why leave it totally ? Well, I'm probably You know! that's only a suggestion. The only trouble is I'm only saying that but yes, I I I take your point, er, as I say, I'm currently er a neighbourhood beat officer, I'm gonna become the crime prevention officer very shortly but I can go on estates like and they say, I haven't seen you for ages! I said but there's been nothing around here Quite honestly I monitor it Mm. by looking what the crime ra , who's But I I'd around I'd love someone like you to come around so I can come up to you and say this close is, er hello Geoff! You know Well yeah I If you've got a problem we we're . I'm very human , I do , and that's how I And some old dear old lady fell out, off the edge of the kerb That's right! because someone's parking right up the pavement. Over a cu , over a cup of tea, I could get a lot of information from you by saying But there is, there is, there is what's happening and various things. but there is literally no one that we can talk to like that. Yeah. I mean, if we've got problems with, with with house protection, you know. Yeah. But there's no one we can talk to, you know. Yeah. Cos you must have a local of crime prevention officer. There must be one somewhere. Well we have got one but I don't believe I've ever seen him. All you can say is could I make could I make an appointment to see you? And he says leave that to the local station, and say, can you leave a message with him to phone me back please. It doesn't, it doesn't happen.

She took the lift up to the sixth floor and came to the room one O nine, which was her room, as she entered she noticed cobwebs and dampness on the walls, she flung her bed, bags on the bed and went downstairs to supper, after her supper she went to report, she went to the reception desk to report the cobwebs and dampness, she rang the bell a few times but no one answered, she was just about to go back to her room when she heard Mr Sandy the receptionist in the back room talking to her assistant, I put the body in Miss Hall's wardrobe, Jane ran upstairs and sure enough there was a body, Jane rang the police then straight away, please could you come to the Riverside Hotel, there's something I think you should see, there was a knock at the door and Mr Sandy answered it, hello, oh hello we've just had phone call from here, are you sure this is the right hotel? Yes, well I didn't call, but I did said Jane, well you leave, well I'll leave you to it said Mr Sandy, if you would come upstairs, the policeman and Jane entered her room, please look in the cupboard, I think we've got a case Sarge, do you mind if I make a quick phone call? Go ahead, hello is Sergeant Briggs there please, if you would just hold for a minute, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, hello this is Sergeant Briggs who's calling? Sergeant it's P C Garfield, Sergeant Huddersfield and myself are at the Riverside Hotel, we've just found a body in Miss Hall's wardrobe room one O nine, well could you describe him? He's about six foot two, short black hair, moustache, blue eyes and according to his record card he's twenty seven and his name is John Banks and he lives at 36 Church Hill Road, Upper Tracey, and we think he's been shot, I'll be right over, stay where you are. About fifteen minutes later Sergeant Briggs entered Jane's room, we'll take him back to the station and tomorrow we'll go around and ask a few questions. Oh by the way Miss Hall do you know anything, said P C Garfield, well said Jane I wasn't going to tell, but I think Mr Sandy and their assistant knows something about it, because about twelve thirty this morning I was going to report about the cobwebs and dampness on the walls and I heard Mr Sandy and his assistant talking in the back room. Well just that they had put the body in my wardrobe, that's a start thanks. The next day the policeman went where Mr Banks lived and they rang the bell, hello, hello are you Mrs Banks? Yes, yes I am. Well we've got some bad news about your son John, oh I think you'd better come in. Well what have you got to tell me about John? I'm afraid, I'm afraid, no, I am very sorry to tell you this but your son has been murdered said Sergeant Briggs, murdered, but how? He was shot, John my poor John, what am I going to tell his wife? He was married? Yes to a Mrs Stow before, I'm sorry we have to tell you like this, anyway do you know why he came to the hotel? Yes he had booked there for a week, I think it was for a business meeting with Mr Sandy, that's all I know. Mr Sandy, are you sure said P C Garfield? Yes he's the receptionist there isn't he? Yes he is, you've been a lot of help, thanks. At midday Sergeant Briggs and P C Garfield went back to the Riverside Hotel to talk to Mr Sandy. Do you know anything about Mr Bank's death said Sergeant Briggs? No, yes you do, don't lie, I heard you yesterday morning, twelve thirty, you were talking to your assistant in the, about you put the body in my wardrobe said Jane, okay I know something, in fact I know a lot more than all of you. I know who did it. Who said P C Garfield? Ah but that would be telling, just tell us said Jane, you really want to know don't you? Look stop playing games and tell us said Sergeant Brigg, okay it was me said Mr Sandy. I could of guessed said P C Garfield, but why? Well I was having an affair with his wife and I loved her so much I wanted to marry her, I wanted his land and his money, so I thought if he was out of the way it would be easier to get what I wanted and of course it was. I hope you know how many years you'll get for this said P C Garfield, of course I do I'm not stupid. Well if you come with me sir, I think it's gonna be about eighteen years for you mate, said Sergeant Briggs, thanks for all your work Jane, that's alright Sarge, a quiet weekend that's all I wanted, some weekend this has turned out to be said Jane Very good, right, good, let's hear yours I'll just read this bit and we'll talk about it later on, yes go on. If you Liz, Elizabeth pretending to be Jessica or is Elizabeth really Elizabeth. Chapter one, Elizabeth was sitting comfortably on a low branch on a tall pine tree in the Wakefield's back garden, she had her knees up round her chin and was leaning against the trunk, this was Elizabeth's thinking seat, the place that she went to be alone, there was a lot to think about, tomorrow Mrs, Mr Davis her form teacher would announce the winner of the class essay contest. Elizabeth had written about saving the world and she thought her essay had a chance of winning, the prize was a year's subscription to the winner's favourite magazine. Elizabeth was going to subscribe to the mysteries around the world, she loved reading Amanda Howard mysteries, but she was also looking forward to tomorrow because it was the first of April, April fool day, April fools day. The day went, her and her sister, her twin sister, Jessica, did their annual April fools day joke, they Elizabeth had won the essay competition and was just about to stand up when Jessica got up and she walked up to Mr and she asked and he asked her what magazine she wanted for the year and she said Rock Seventeen Jessica knew what magazine Elizabeth wanted and she just said Rock Seventeen. Then she had to stay behind and got Jessica's detention and was late for her next lesson and got another detention for running in the main building. But the trouble was they were both at the same time after school where she was meant to be decorating the hall for the disco after school that night. Then, she got Jessica's C for her cooking class instead of the A Jessica got off hers. But, after school she went to her detention with Mr and course, the note said going to the dentist, sudden toothache. So she went to her other detention and there was another note saying, had to pick up my child from school. So, she went to decorate the hall and got sent out with people saying she was Jessica. Elizabeth slammed the kitchen door and dropped her bag. What's wrong said Jessica? So Elizabeth told her everything that had happened today and after half an hour they decided to tell everyone what the they had done at the disco that night. So that night, at the disco they told them and at last they believed them and sorted out the magazine thing and changed the magazine to Mysteries from Around the World. And then, they changed the cookery marks. And Jessica said, I'll race to the cake and the twins were back to normal . Mm! Now right! Well I am going to have to look at them both. And see if I, I like them both. There's, there's a lot of work gone into those . Erm i if I'm honest I think I found Holly's easier to understand on a first reading but that may be because I think perhaps read it. Perhaps, in a slightly more clearer way than you did. That doesn't mean that yours isn't as good. So I, what I want to do now, and I have do eve take time to do it, I can't do it just now when you're here. But I want to look at them both and I will go through them as well and mark them for spelling and for for your punctuation and everything else. But, really you both put a tremendous amount of work in! They're great! Can I just say something? Yeah. Cos, didn't gonna say know when Jessica got up cos I've got pretend erm got up for the erm So what's it? What is it? It's April Fool. Yeah, it's April Fool's Yeah. day. Er, what they do, every year they switch identities e , Jessica pretends to be Elizabeth, and Elizabeth pretends to be Jessica but, this year they don't do that cos tha all their friends like know and, this year cos their teachers and things still think that they're erm so , they swapped identities they like, give detention and things to the wrong people and stuff like that. And, when Jessica gets up to do get the magazine it's cos Mr told her but course she thought it was Je , erm Elizabeth but she wa wasn't so What's D T? That's detention. She went to her detention, I see! Right. So we just sort of say essay, D T to show what I mean. Yeah. Well well yes we used to get used to get detention, yes, but erm the thing we used to get more than anything else was pink paper. Mm? Did you have to take it home to your parents? Pink paper To show that you've was been naughty? Pink paper was a foolscap sheet of paper like like that Mm. but it was pink! Pink! And if you had to do if you had, say, three sheets of pink paper because you've been naughty and done something wrong, you had to fill three sides of pink foolscap paper with writing. You might have to write an essay or you do copy writing on the pa , do three sheets of pink paper, you had to three sheets of writing! And it was pink paper and at the top it had space for your parent's signature so that when you've done the work your parents had to Mm. sign it so they'd know if you'd had pink paper. What erm That was the, that was the worst, that was the pink paper, and then what we normally have to do. you got yo would have to take and hour or take two hours, or take three hours and if you take up to three hours or if you got three separate hours that was detention and if we were in our in the junior part of the school in the first three forms erm, you then had to go into school on Saturday morning. In the senior school we had to go into school Saturday morning anyway! And you had Wednesday We we afternoon off. No, we didn't! We we worked Monday to Saturday Our when my morning. When my We had games on Wednesday afternoon but we had, in the senior school When my we had school on Saturday morning as well as the rest of the week! My erm my dad's mum, they used to go to school Monday, Tuesday Wednesday morning, have Wednesday afternoon off, all day Thursday, all day Friday and Saturday morning! But they would have Wednesday afternoon off. Oh! Right. For some reason ! Okay. So we've got a little time left. Erm let's have a look at your English these English progress papers. Okay. Because, I want to do a little bit of that erm we are going Ah! what page are we on now? We started something last week. , I mean I've finished that. Yes, what paper was that? The Locuses. About the Locusts. What page was that? I don't know. I don't know. Here it is! Here's the page. Page twenty eight. Page twenty eight. That's right. Now, how far did we get with that? Erm, we finished the bit about the locusts. Right. So Ten to five. Okay. Number eight we've got to do. I think. Look, look! Look! Yes. Number eight. I think you hold it right at the end. Do you? Do this don't you? Oh you do don't you? Did we mark it? No. The Did we not mark it? They're all ma they're alright though. Cos we didn't Cos we but we didn't the last one? So right! Okay. So we'll go on to page that page twenty eight, number eight. If you'd like to do it now and then we'll mark it. Number eight? Number eight. Paper over Oh! there. Yes! Underline the correct answer in the brackets. So write it down, don't underline it. Just write the, write the sentence down. How do you write it though? You gotta choose the correct one. Mm. This should be very apt from what you've just been doing. Mm! My, am I, am I an author now? I don't know. Mm? That might well be mightn't it? I know I'm, no I'm just coming to sort you out because as you say you did that with Mrs . So, you haven't done this yet? I've done that Terry. Right. Wait for Lucy to do it and then we'll read it out. Oh! Ooh ooh ooh! Don't think, the spelling's wrong. Yes I have! Cos I I'm usually a good speller! One of these. Over to dad and Becky. Oh, she's terrible! Mm. Doesn't know how to spell scene! Does she not? No, she No. i , when we have like, something like scene one she puts S double E N! Mm. Oh! She doesn't know how to spell having. She goes, she puts erm, A, hey, no H, H A V E I N G! She's useless at spelling! Right , so what have you got there? Well now, it should a be a person who writes books is An. An. An! Oh! An author. Mm. An author. Why do you put an instead of a? Because it's got a vowel! Because author A vowel. comme , starts with an A, right, a vowel. Right, number nine. So do number nine. Mhm! Oh! So what have you got? It's a journalist. Journalist. A person who writes articles for a newspaper is a journalist. For a newspaper is a journalist . Journalist! Good! Right! Number ten then. When he breaks Oh sorry I didn't mean to It's when we break into a house to steal is called a It's called it's called a prisoner! Mm mm . Do you know the story o , first of all I was gonna write about fairground about a erm ghost Ghost train then I thought, no, I wouldn't write that. Then I was gonna write about a hotel you know, erm Heartbreak Hotel thought no, wouldn't write about that. Want something exciting, so I thought a murder ! Yes. So it's a burglar, right? B U R G L A R. A murder. E actually yours made me think of a story that I was told many years ago on a coach trip over Dartmoor Mm. when a lady who lived on Dartmoor for many, many years erm was telling stories of things that had actually happened True? to her. Well, for instance, that she lived in a in an old vicarage, cos her husband had been a a, no a tri , priest in the Church of England and er we her house was haunted and she was telling us stories and sh she quite often saw the ghost, she was never worried, she never cos it never frightened her it wasn't vicious or anything like that and she often saw it quite matter of fact . As a matter of fact, she often saw this ghost. But, she was telling the story of a man who was travelling over the moor and it was many years ago on horseback and er he was completely lost and wan , it was getting dark and he wanted to stay somewhere for the night and he sort of travelled and couldn't see anywhere and eventually down a long drive he saw a house wi , blazing with lights so he went down this house and er, all the windows were alight, you know were lit up and he knocked at the door and knocked at the door, and knocked at the door and couldn't get any answer, no one ever came to the door so in desperation he thought well this is no good! So he went back up onto the main road and very little further on, in fact, he in fact found a village and spent the night at the hostelry and he said to the man in the hostelry you know,he that he'd been lost and that a a little bit back on the road he'd seen this big house all alight and he had erm, you know, gone in the drive and tried to get get a room there but couldn't make anybody hear and the erm the inn keeper said, no he said er you wouldn't make anyone hear there, he said and if you go back there tomorrow the house won't be there! And he went back and it wasn't! Weird! Why not? It had gone! What a ghost made it? Yeah. I like, I love Told a lot of ghost stories, yes! I love listening in my to ghost stories in Dartmoor. Oh I know this really story! Go on then. Right, it's about this erm lady, I'll make it that she lived on Dartmoor with her erm grandson erm and her moth and he sa daughter and she is a gran , she was a grandlady a grandmother. A grandlady ! And erm, they lived in this little cottage and erm every night erm the moth , she would always stay up really late and the mother and erm her son would go to bed and she would always go out of this erm go out of the house every night and she would go, cos she had these three fingers which were blades Oh! you know like Freddy Kruger three fingers that looked like blades and every night she would go to erm the fields and erm she would go into sheep fields and cow fields and she would kill three sheep and a cow every night except for a Sunday night! Every morning farmers would come and they would see this claw mark on the neck of these of their sheep and their cows and they were, they were quite worried cos all their sheep and cows were like dying every night! They were quite worried about it. And so they went to report to the, to the police but and th I mean they didn't believe them, they thought it was just like birds. And erm and she kept doing this for ages and erm she was, she was sta starting to get worried because people might believe, find out that it was her and so after she killed a cow, she took out all of i , all it's insides and hid in it and no one ever found her! Oh dear! Terrible! And then, she Ooh! Ooh! she was It's horrible isn't it? And then she hid inside this cow! Mm! And she killed it! ? Right! I think we'd Ha. better leave it at that hadn't we? Will you before you come to me next time Mhm. finish down to number twenty eight? And learn those spellings? Right? So that's going to be page twenty eight and twenty nine. Okay, learn your spellings! Now, I'll have to talk to your mums but it may well be that I shan't be here in a fortnight's time so we may Oh! have to put things back a week. Okay. But we'll we'll think about that nearer the time. Alright? Okay. Okey-doke And you'll leave your compositions with me and I will look up, and if I can get the marks before then as I probably will I'll let you have them back. Okay? Okay. Right! So, one more week to go and then you've got a holiday. Yes ! Ha hum! At last! Yeah, that's right. Right? Bye bye girls! Bye bye! Ballet now. Cor you got ballet now have you? Yes we Hello Adrian! Alright? Yes thanks. So all set for a break tomorrow? Yeah. Thank you. Have I got to give your mummy change this time? Er yeah. It looks like it Oh yeah. doesn't it? I'll go and get some. I know, right. That's alright. That's fine. Erm right! What book are we on? Four A. It's alright, this is erm, yours. Yeah, I know I was looking for the erm oops! Now right! So how have we got on with that? Er ah, I did some at home but we haven't done any booklet work this week. You haven't done any booklet work? Okay. Because we've been doing Pythagoras theorem. Oh have you? Yeah. I'll just show you what we've been doing. Yeah. Show us what you've been doing. You understand it? Yeah well sort of! We're erm that's the booklet I'm on at the moment. What's this one? I haven't seen this one. Oh! It's it's er ? Yeah. Did that yu , yesterday. Not all that. Is that from here? Yeah. Yeah. Work from that. And an an the the sheets. And now I've just started this. I'm gonna finish the end of C six for homework, and I'm on C six A. And that's what we've been doing, all about it. Right. Okay? Yeah. So do you wanna finish that now? Yeah please. Right, okay. I I knew that erm I uns , I sa understand some of it but some of it I find a bit hard to understand like this bit, it says be careful, sometimes the unknown side is is the longest side and sometimes it is not. But I thi , I I can't, I know that you have to take it away. Yes but the thing is this in a right angle triangle Mm. the longest side is called what? Cos it The hypotenuse. The hypotenuse, right! So the longer side is always the hypotenuse. Yeah. Right? Now, what is the formula for your Pythagoras theorem? The sum of the erm I do I don't, I know, my dad's taught me a different one to Miss , she she taught me that erm i the, oh hang on! It's back here. I got a new book today so but she taught that is was ha! Erm, if I can find it! The right angle triangle. The areas and squares on the two short sides add together to equal the area on the square of the hypotenuse. Right! The square on the hypotenuse Yeah. equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides. Yeah. The square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides. Okay. Alright? Yeah. And the squ hypotenuse is always the longest side. It's the side opposite the right angle. Mhm. So there's your right angle that is the hypotenuse and the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares, that's the su , the area of that square and the area of that square add together the sum of the squares on the other two sides. Okay. Alright? The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. So what they're saying is this that the square on that side Mm. is thirty six, so what's the length of that side? Erm that must be nine. No! Sorry! Aha. What then? The square root of thirty six. What two numbers amount to Six. That's right. So the that side must be six centimetres Yeah. The square is six times six which is thirty six. That is four square centimetres. Mm. It's four centimetres and the square is sixteen so, what must be the area of that square? Twenty. Twenty. Right! So you've got to find what number multiplied together makes twenty. Mm. So it's going to, the length of that side is going to be the So you square the root of twenty. Find the square root of twenty don't you? You find the square root of twenty. That's right. And how do you find the square root of twenty? Just use that. You'll use that yes! Mm mm. Aren't you lucky? Mm. Because I we never had sa we never had erm calculators. Wha what did you have to do then? So you had to find the square root of by ar either arithmetic by Mm. doing in an arithmetic way or you had to use a sca , a log table. You had to use log tables. You had to use this sort of thing like find it up in a mess hasn't it? Erm I had to go to a table like that which said square roots and I had to look up twenty It's got on the back actually. Back of this book. Square roots twe Oh yeah. square root is twenty and it's four point four seven two one. Yeah, square root. That's right. But, as you say you can use this Which one do you push now? That one. That's right. Four point four seven two. Yeah. So, you know, that's well the way you do it. So th that's how you find that. So now when you got these three here I've done these. You've done those have you? Yeah, look. Here are. Well let's see that you got them right shall we? Six five A. So, this one you've got twenty five equals nine plus some number. Right? Mhm. So, that is going to be sixteen isn't it? Yeah. No it isn't. Yes it is! Yes it is, sixteen. So, what's that gonna be? Sixteen to erm, square root of sixteen Sixteen is four. Four. So that's gonna be four. So, C five A, have you got four? Yeah. Yes you have. Right. Now, B again, that the square root of that is going to equal the square root of that plus the square root of that. So you've got sixteen Mm. Or rather, sixty four e eighty one equals sixty four plus some number. So, sixty four from eighty one Gives you six which is erm, seventeen so it's Gives you er seventeen. Gives you seventeen. So now, for the answer to that out today, nanny's got a lot of work to do, and she's got loads of cakes to make and all sorts. No, I'm sorry darling, come up later, we've got to go. Let me get myself sorted out and Nanny, nanny will probably have you up later when Ben helps Gramps to feed the dogs, and he won't do that either will he,feed him Cake, cake, cake Nanny hasn't got any cakes at the moment cos you've got to cook them, say bye, bye No yes, come on Bye, bye say bye, bye. Hey up, I got some Some what? we had five pounds worth Did ya? went into saw a mate of mine Oh alright he says how many do you want? I says two or three so he give us three Oh how much this is like confession you know save you going to church on a Sunday This is true Is that where you got to now? Don't look at me I didn't order them What is it? I'm not complaining mister, yeah he double mm Spoke to las yesterday, yesterday evening Yeah Got some more here Got more? Yeah Did you gather all spelt differently These Oh got two the same these are on the just trying to contract me down Yeah I expect to drive him Yeah got to go back and sort out any more problems we've got, that's where I'm going now erm Why have you got more problems? get a complete list of complaints of them I thought that you got that already Well I got Rhys says I've got to do it proper and then into Chelmsford do, do wasting his time, thank you, ta, he's wasting his time He was, got smacked and told him I believe it they've got, they've got so many local companies Yeah you know board, even Daleys in Leicester Yeah and they go and drag somebody up in Yeah and he says to them, the thing is when it goes wrong You're stuck well you've got a three hour drive to go and put it right Yes you know you just that's it, another thing is I don't think to ask, cos you hear from the way they were talking they were buying it I don't know, but er they've got themselves stuck on the nine o'clock appointment Who's that? Ropers, they don't know, well they know I'm coming in some time today, but they don't know when Yeah so it's Crazy absolutely crazy Yeah well I If this is where I you know what I've been trying to get hold of a couple of one of these you know the phones, the phones that Donald's got Oh not the, I thought you meant yeah Yeah what for yourself? Yeah I don't like it Don't you? I don't, no Certainly faster than the I've got I dunno erm, no I don't like them at all it's in fact I'm not even impressed with it I mean you look at the people with G six hundred and you look at the fifty six and they're not a Fifty six hundred? No oh you think well that's not an executive phone that's just er a phone with a couple of buttons on it Yeah well you know what the six hundreds are don't ya? No That's the white one with the, with the green L E D display it's got the calculator on it no, that's the fifty six hundred, the same model as O S D T Yeah the erm, the six hundred has got a separate power supply little black eighteen volt car looks like a mark two executive station, instead of being L C D it's L E D display, green L E D Rider's got one, you know as you walk in Oh yeah, the on the right Oh that thing Yeah, did you like them? They're one of the best we've ever done, I tell you what You know there's quite a few about, I've seen them, you know Mm must of taken about ten years to make Eh? its external goes in the back far superb Yeah well, I put the paperwork in there and I well I always keep it in the box so I don't get mixed up then, I don't start calling the mark three key board I wonder why it doesn't work Bruising quite well innit? Yes your neighbours could do with a lesson in parking Oh this one or that one? Well I think it's Gary I mean he's left a gap there's room for just about a car either side of him Yeah, oh I know I've said time and time again to them if you park up a bit, you know that house his driveway that he put up and er he just about misses where the tree was, but he's chopped all the tree down so he can have his grass, I dunno, well even if it meant just supporting the piece of something above his car so he don't get any sap on it or ought Yeah well that's a point yeah there's something I didn't thought of that It gets me how people drive a car sometimes with a to look through oh yeah Well, well see how it goes, but erm I don't, the thing is you see they can teach you so much about laying different bonds and making patterns and doing portholes and things like that, that'll be handy to know, but obviously you're not gonna learn that until much later on Mm, what about arches with a keystone? Yeah they'll probably teach you that, yeah more than likely, yeah, you'd of touch the chimney flue, part of it, but the trouble is the qualifications have fall beyond of what I want to do anyway and considering it's gonna cost a couple of grand to get it Yeah it's not worth it because I'm not gonna sort of get myself into a position where I'm only likely, where in other words get a job as a bricklayer Yeah so it's really not worth getting qualifications on reflection so I want to do a bit of work you see, build myself a reputation that sort of thing Yeah and then do the odd wall, that's fine yeah, I'm tempted to go around now looking at brickwork now Mm getting ideas Mm and probably incorporate one or two, can't do that on the garage though cos it won't, it's gonna be out of character Mm, yeah, but er the, Russ' erm, done, well he's already got a wall, just make it a bit bigger, an existing wall just taking it around the back so gonna do that in the summer I'll erm, well in the spring, yeah gives er a bit, a bit of a practice Mm what's Russell like any good? Yeah, he's quicker than I am, but he don't seem to be as accurate Yeah you know, by the time I've got about three bricks down, he's two he's not as accurate as I am, no, but what I do I, I point mine up as well Yeah cos that way it gives me a bit more incentive, it gives me an idea of how it's looking Yeah whereas Russ just throws it together and don't bother pointing it, and to me that is incentive, I mean you don't do it when you build it I know you don't, when you're earning, it's a bit of er, a mark, a guide to how you do it. And er, certainly take advantage of the half price Yeah thing , for twenty four quid for a hundred and eight weeks, you've got, you've got to take that, think it's coming on and learning, got the thing in there, start to progress it might get you, it's gonna get to the point where he says right, you know you've got them just about to sort of labour it's, you know, accurately with a fair amount of speed now we'll start sort of now being a bit adventurous, gonna get a lot more interesting. You sees like cutting, you know you see these walls that are like that and they sort of go down like that and join a pillar and do the same again, just, instead of doing that you lay the soldiers across the top and you, you've got to sort of cut the bricks in between ain't ya? Mm Cutting bricks is another fault of Russ, it's all commonsense actually if you think about it, I mean actually we've drove round at night looking at people's walls and things like that and some were absolutely appalling, they've obviously paid money to have that done,so you, you, you can see it don't have to be absolutely perfect Mm although I'm, that'll only do for me Yeah, these floors are impossible to yeah, he's had his drive took across his back you know that there mm They do it individual don't they? Mm yeah, there's one good there but, erm what they do, is they do it in concrete you know, but they can make it look like bricks Yeah they colour the concrete Oh dear and they, they put the concrete down, then they get this thing to put on it and it, it sort of moulds it Yeah it just textures it like Mm looks like bricks, another one they can make it look like welsh slate and things like that Christ Yeah yeah it's quite er What are those audio monitors? Monitor audio yeah Monitor audi Yeah it's sort of an L in shape of a O we've got Oh yeah oh did ya? Yeah, what I like about, what I liked about them was that they were dead flat like, you know if you, imagine it a sweet the weight for a sweet were from say ten ounces to twenty kilos Yeah you have some speakers if you, if you do a run like that you'll hit a pitch were it resonate with the speaker Yeah I mean most speakers have got resonate point, some, most of them are quite low Yeah but these, there are nothing, you know, there is no intonation at all Yeah it was just everything that you heard was As it should be Yeah like crisp you know Yeah Yeah, I mean I don't know how powerful they were that, I mean he weren't, he weren't belting on those but there was, he was playing loud enough to appreciate with its own you know Yeah oh it went really well, how much does it cost? He was on about something about apparently monitors for some reason the most monitor cost, monitor class speakers Yeah but they're infinite in there er Yeah I've heard that Yeah Yeah that's what he was saying as long as you don't what was he saying? Some it you have to do I think one rule that you have to follow and as long as you follow that particular rule then they can handle infinite amount of power, don't make sense to me No cos there are some direct drive aren't they, you know a lot of them passed a couple don't they there's a Mm an output stage Mm and a really big I think it goes through that way, but, I think these are direct drive, but it's actually a straight piece in you know Is it? Yeah, straight into the back of the speaker so you can actually make the speaker do what you want like Yeah to within reason like Yeah, so the amp has to be match, match it then? Or do you have to, have som You might, yeah , the trouble is it's gotta match down to be exact or Mm, is his amp like that? Yeah, his amp's got, yeah his amp was built for this particular type of er, I can't remember what bloody amp he's got now there were no, no particularly flash like, you know, er, er, they were saying something to do with clipping, I think it's to do with clipping they saying the power up, the power point's alright as long as you don't clip, because what happens is if the wave forms doing that Yeah you gain er an R M S with power Yeah but if you, if you actually clipping Yeah the speaker's actually being pushed by the amp and staying out Mm you're practically burning the coil out so it's just a dri , a straight forward plattening Mm it can't handle any more so you got a, a playing into the coil and it's not doing anything so it's just, just in you know Yeah I think that's the point what he's making and that's what actually you know does the lamp damage that mm Do you speak good for what they are? Yeah they are To say erm that's what bothers me about it you ain't You just ain't got the power though Well the thing is to buy summat like it you know, you, you can spend a lot of bloody money just to try and improve That's right them, you know that's right, well the thing is these are, I was looking at the power today I, er not read it properly in the past, there only four rounds, these have got to be A, if you want both A and B on Yeah you've got to have A tons Yeah if you have, cos what, what happens is if you put A and B it erm it parallels them off, so if you've got two sets of four amps it's in two rows Oh yeah so it's no good cos it's four to A zones, you can run four providing you only have that channel Can't say that I suppose you could, but it's got A and B outputs you see Yeah but it says here nominal input twenty five watts R M S here it says maximum what forty watts yeah, but that's a hundred I mean you can tell, I've tried it, it is, I, I ain't even had it half way and it's, you can tell it's overdriving them Yeah is that a four to eight, O drive as well, does it say four to eight games? It does, it's hundred watts, yeah it says you can use anything between four and eight Os Yeah but if you want them both, if you want both A and B on you've got to have a Yeah but er it's measure hundred, hundred watts R M S into eight Os So it's Does he want fruit juice? No he won't yeah What do you think to the board game on the back? Oh, I thought it quite witty actually, yeah Miracle Squares I think there's a lot of thought gone into it you know, it can't be easy to re er to, to just dream up a game erm, I like the one about you go to the last supper and the waiter spills soup on your trousers, the waiter, ha tell you else about the Marx brothers an'all, the waiter is er the king of Snowdonia and it's Groucho Marx, the, they've got this massive hall, and er these big steps leading down into it you know and as, as they're coming in there's somebody at the top and Ann says who's, who's walking in and they walk down the stairs you know and Mr and Mrs and the king has you know and he says oh the king Snowdonia is about to arrive, he should be here any minute now, he should be here dead on this time you know, he gets these big fanfare trumpets up da, da, da, da, the king of Snowdonia, and there's nothing and all of a sudden it flashes to Groucho Marx and then he's in bed with and, and they do it about four or five times, you know, the king of Snowdonia, welcome to see and all the bugles going you know all of a sudden he appears in the middle of the picture he says oh I've come through the back door Yeah don't know how many films they made do you? No, they used to have a very good thing didn't they at weekends for Did they? Yeah a few years ago They usually have them at erm Christmas time don't they, usually have a couple of Marx Brothers' films on Yeah Say you can buy them films if you want Yeah I, I, looking what it says in erm, rather than take the load Yeah cos they're not, they're not, get round to it otherwise erm, I'm hoping they do you know how long it lasts? A couple of hours Does it? Mm Dave Allen's on that as well the only bit, I think I've set it for the Beast Master ain't I? Yeah Yeah well when right at the beginning of the tape is Dave Allen, but that's adult Yeah so, don't let the kids watch that. Yeah Do you like him? Sometimes yeah Mm Only now and again though Mm Oh dear What's the time then? Still got the timesheets to do yet I've got a load of paperwork to do tomorrow Have ya? what actually paper or the Bills er, customer bills Oh sort out which bits are you know Mm, I've only got one charge me this week, you don't seem to get many now Oh I just have one connect, connect to programme, programme one, ha only get all these programmes for some reason, somebody allowed for it when they put the system in, mind you still have to check it I suppose but checked through it, tested it, took me about five minutes, still a minimum charge of an hour try and include the customers into as much as possible Mm I'm giving er a reduced rate for a while, so if anything goes wrong we foot the bill Oh yeah say like we're moving some equipment from one place to another Yeah we do all the disconnect cable and yeah check it out for them and they want a quote, say it takes two blokes an hour each Yeah quote them a couple of hours, we drop the normal rate, you know by say thirty percent to start Yeah and wrap it up into a package and say you know if anything goes wrong and it takes four hours then you the same, yeah, cos if, didn't the Co-Op move or something? Oh yeah they did er And they fell flat on their face didn't they? Yeah, they did a move like Yeah it cost them a bomb that did Well we went to a solicitor's office, what was it Friday morning? Thursday morning? Friday morning? And erm they'd moved the kit, got the electricians to do it and it took, it took three fuses when they did it, I mean the extensions fused on that particular system, the data pairs fused Mm and er they had to call us in, well Dick went out and er I think it was actually two separate visits so they must of, cos they're refurbishing the place you see so they must of moved into one office and thought oh you know this don't work, move into another office the day after, well this don't work either and he, he actually did two separate visits, whether they'll actually bill them for it I don't know , but I mean it's a minimum of an hour in both cases so Mm you know two calls, two hours Mm I dunno what we get asked to do you know, I mean in some cases we can handle everything like pulling out bloody cables after other receive in that kind of thing Yeah Oh I had one bloody customer see if I can quote him to a complete relocate, it was only a bloody er systems, probably no taller than that speaker Yeah but it's like a P C a bit Yeah like a flat P C but a power system one Oh them sitting on the desk? Yeah Mm be like, be a bit lonely you know something like that, that kind of line Mm that width wanted it relocated with all the cabling and that, you know er to the terminals Yeah in the same building? No to another site Mm this is why it's you know Yeah I says if we do it for you it'll cost you a fortune, he said yeah cos a lot of it's bloody play by ear you know the contract's Yeah put together Yeah if, they can't, they've got this system when they can key it in you know and comes up with a price, but it's that bloody strip Yeah you're better off just putting a bloody mm mm Now is the time for the engineering man that is it yeah So you, it, he got you to move it in the end? Yeah I didn't do it in myself like, but we did, we did end, end up with yeah. I went to some er, what was it, estate agents erm Alan Orwood on King Street, I says to them er, what was it, want an extra extension put in who do you go to? I says well where did you get the system from? Communications, I said well you can either go to them or you can got to, we'll do it for ya, so it's really up to you, he says well who's the cheapest? I says well I don't know to be honest, I says I don't deal with them, but we were talking about Mercury these cross-routing got one of these systems here Mm and then I said have you got, are these cross-routing it? He says no, he says we've thought about it, I says well you really ought to have it I says if you're dial dialling a lot of erm, cos they dial a lot of these insurance companies and er mortgage lenders, the head offices, they're always out in Ottingham, I said the Mercury pin number only cost you seven pound fifty a year, I says you think you can save that in a week so er ha so erm he was on about it, he says who's the cheapest for that? I says well we, we put erm a mailshot out for four hundred and ninety nine pound, cos the software and all the re-programming involved, I says Ford Communications followed it up, you know, they put a mailshot out for two hundred and ninety nine pound all in, oh he says I think I'd rather prefer G P T to them Mm which is erm now I'm dealing all the same company, maintenance and everything Mm so er we've got to hang on to it Mm surprising how, especially the, the bigger companies as well they tend to want to do things Yeah, it's only a small estate agent Yeah it's, it's surprising how many companies want to like leave that side of things to un Yeah one company may handle the lot from that's it, yeah, yeah There's a lot of money to be made in that if you want little bits of, put things here and there that you can different mm yeah I even if he puts the cable in, did replace put the cable in then? No we subcontract it Oh yeah we've got two subcontractors that we get in touch with, they just do it and then bill owes and then we uplift it Yeah but effectively the customers are only dealing with plastic of Mm Yeah for their own in installation like Yeah that's right yeah Yeah probably as we don't add any real value when we did little jobs like the cabling you know Yeah they come to us and all we've done is uplifting and gone bloody subcontracting Yeah whereas other bigger sites we do all the planning and everything you know Mm so we actually add some value to it Well we do that, we do that, we, we know Yeah exactly what we've got, erm Yeah how many clients we've got, you know for updating, what the capacities are and plus er we don't know erm what sort of cable we've got in so they might have only a ten P a cable when they already have nine pairs in use Yeah and they want two extra extensions you see in a certain area, we obviously don't know that Mm only the contractors do and even they only know when they go on site so, but we, we sort of say you do this, you do that and then we contract to who can do it, there's some of them by er usually mm I think for er even for upgrades we er the contracts do it sometimes which to me's wrong cos they aren't engineers Mm But what er what what needles me a bit, but you can't blame them cos I, if I was er a small communications firm I'd do the same myself, but, you see we won't sell now small systems through a sell we do it through a dealership, like if you want a Cortin if you want a Sierra you've got to go to Cowlers or something you can't go to Ford Mm for it, they won't sell it ya, it's the same as us, we won't sell direct Mm so these businesses they buy from you know erm communications company, a local company or Nottingham Telephones or something like that Mm and, erm what they tend to do once it's gone in they'll say if there's anything you need, if you get any problems on the system or there's anything you want he says get in touch with us, he says and if necessary we'll get in touch with and we'll sort it out ourselves and what they do, if a customer says oh there's a phone that's broke, or it's not working or something like that, they'll say oh okay we'll get in touch with the maintenance for you, you see, cos he's making nowt out of it, if you say we dropped the phone and broke it, well we'll send a and then they send an engin one of their blokes out with a replacement phone and charge him for a new one, once they say wants some re-programming doing, oh yeah were sending an engineer round and they get, the dealer then gets the money for it so all we get is the flack end of it you know so we, a service contract it's priced because, low because you know you're gonna make a bit on moves and changes Mm and that sort of thing, you know re-programming and upgrade, but we don't get that now because the er, the dealers are filtering all that sort of work off Mm which it can't be right cos, I suppose in a way it's none of our business but it is I mean if it gets to it, it puts our company in financial difficulties it means it's jobs on the line int it that sort of thing Mm that's why we've got to start cutting back there's no money for wage rises and that sort of thing so what they are doing you see, an authorized dealer, well even a non-authorized dealer get hold of a piece of kit and then somebody say want this system, right okay, and they just have a big load of forms for maintenance agreements and all they do the dealer'll go along and put this kit in, B T'll come along and say yeah that conforms to regulations, sign here, the customer er sign here, the dealer send the maintenance agreement to us, we signed it, send it back, we've never even seen it, then we turn up and find that the main control unit's high up in the attic or in a damp cellar, in a cupboard where you can't see it, there's no light and stuff like that and we're taking jobs on like that and it you know, it's just impossible to work on them Mm you see, but B T are not interested in that, all they're interested in is that the wiring's, you know that the boards are Mm the series that they should be, but we do pre-maintenance inspections now Mm and, cos I said to the dealers for a long time you know don't put them under stairs, don't put them in store rooms, they get locked, locked up with vacuum cleaners and you can't get to the gear when you go to them, don't put them high up on the wall we can't reach them and they just laugh, but er, I think the last laugh's on us now cos er if I see one high up on the wall, I say well that, I say we're not accepting that, you have to move it Mm what you doing you daft cat? What a life Eh? What a life eh? I know, woke up this morning she was, she was obviously cold, cat was right under the covers, snuggled right up to me and got her, her chin on me arm like that, I was asleep Justifying Nation, did you like that? Good innit? Mm, mm like that one that's quite good What's that? A new one where he got up a Roger's got Transmission Vamp erm Velveting Yeah, yeah that's good Yes C D Where? Erm West Park Leisure Centre Oh It's a bit in the Midlands sort of What Wendy James was she? Mm, she stop the bloody ha, stop the traffic when she used to walk in you know Yeah Everybody but you was looking at her out the window, incredible she really was Yeah, very short int she though Wendy James Is she? Oh I dunno Oh yeah, she's only about four foot ten Oh I didn't know, didn't know that Mm right midget Oh Yeah Oh she's quite bright though ain't she? Yeah Really She's no thicko is she? I like them, I like erm Transmission Vamp Yeah Crashers one of my favourites too your the only one as well Yeah Rich er Russ played that yesterday, I played it through that on his C D, put it through his Leek speakers, brilliant Mm I used to like a lot of that stuff you know the New Wave the erm Yeah The Stranglers er something Do you want some more fruit juice? No Did you read that proper that bit? Yeah most of it like, yeah you see if there's any what Young Bailey Yeah critics did you see that? Eh? The critics? Not under that one no where they didn't like the Christmas, not the modern parents where they, they wouldn't let them have a Christmas tree, the erm the critics is was erm oh what was that about? We saw it on telly and the er what was it Crispen or er Crispen something typical vegetarian names and she was criticizing the television Top Of The Pops and how they could do better you know and they got an art Oh I remember you saying yeah it'd cost you about a hundred thousand quid and by the time they've done it, it's exactly the same as what the other one was . They're not tending to play Bohemian Rhapsody on the er radio so much are they as er No The Days Of Our Lives, they tend to play that a bit more Yeah they need to I've never heard that you know until, until it was, this round, since it last come out must be out of touch in me old age Probably, perhaps you don't notice it so much do you, but something, something like that breaks the tension on it don't it I suppose Yeah if you don't , if you don't like it you probably just put it to the back of your mind then Yeah dismiss it something Yeah , yeah, what's the other one? It uncle Vern, big Vern something? yeah, he's all, all erm he's on the front cover ain't he, I'm not spending my Christmas in joking he's, he's thinking the law's after him all the time He's always wanting to top himself as well isn't he? Yeah eh? Completely useless isn't he? Which one's that? It's the spook of Brassnick isn't it out of Dandy is it? Was it the Dandy? Sparky was it? That bloody one No the cos Brassnick was the one with the square head and the cap weren't he? Yeah, I didn't think there was a children's one I think cos we used to have them on a trolley, yeah mm, I wonder if that is the same that I, I think next time I get a Whizz I'll erm, I'll look cos there's a Zit comic as well Yeah I'll have a look and see if it's the same publishers, cos it looks the same kind of format, but then again it probably would be cos it's aimed at the same market Yeah so they're probably trying to muscle into the er that niche you see, but er brown bottle you find the critics? No I ain't read this Ain't ya? no I've not read that Take it until you've read it No you're alright, it's Keep the cheapskates parade they've got inflatable sheep and all sorts for set up here oh it's still number one then Yeah What you looking at there? No it's er pair of tits on the front on the tree On the tree house yeah, yeah, what's that one called? Leafy Woods, The House in Leafy Woods That's it, yeah what was the one er, the out of date Christmas puddings, did you read that one as well? It's about four pages long that one where at the end, you don't, you know, you expect it's haunted to be a real you know, she says oh no screw that we've got the market by the bollocks the vicar Adolf Hitler they've been playing loads of, out of date Christmas puddings I don't know but the artwork's very good ain't it? Yeah You know the ideas there I think The men's best buy in Leafy Woods when Frank taught the children many of natures wonderful secrets Ha what about these done, is it safe to eat these? No Jack, cos you see these are rocks Oh dear A modern parent sitting there with a polo neck jumper on loads of big teeth Play all the record after er Queen aren't they? What's that? This is funny number one, probably Queen's not number one any more then I don't know put the radio on and find out Something about Kwiksave not being in these supermarkets Yeah Yeah I've always said Kwiksave are the best Well, bloody hell only nineteen pence cheaper out of a bo basketful Eh? Only nineteen pence cheaper out of a basketful, everybody else is only pennies over Oh yeah It's still cheaper we notice the joints of beef in Tesco gone up by a few quid Is what? gone up by a few quid from six pound odd to eight pound odd Oh, it says here the basic necessities the things you buy have er have actually gone up, or they've hardly moved at all. that amp's good Is it? Mm yeah I like that So when they picking his car up then? Tonight I think Yeah? I was going to ring him up tonight gonna ring him up after the So which one's having it? Well the first one's already had the first chance Mm I'm gonna tell him there'll be no fetch it'll go to the tomorrow night the other one Mm mm, you've done well then to get that one I'm bloody sure I wouldn't of paid it no way, er, thing is though you see when you first look at it, it don't look a bad car, but when you start studying it closely you start to see just exactly what problems it's got with it did you point out the faults on it then? Think he told him that's why it won't did he tell him about the hole in the wing then? And the head gasket that had gone? Said it, the bloke at the garage said they've changed the oil and that now he said it ain't bloody leaking You don't get all that water from nowhere who choose the oil? The bloke at the garage? Terry did it I know Terry changed it, yeah but it's not well it ain't run far enough has it? Really I reckon there's something wrong, convinced of it, oh it runs alright once it's moving it's just such an awkward driver that's all I was glad to get out of the thing I was did knock the bloody er whatsit down, buses knock the er gate way down to the embankment, were jogging down there tonight, I'll have a look at it mm on about it Flogged it No, none of them yeah the lad with the Porsche offered three thousand with four brand new tyres on it and a year's M O T, that's what he offered when the when it was done Yeah and the other one never got back, he said he'd ring up to eleven o'clock last night, half past ten Ain't you rang him? Oh no, cos it er you'll took that three grand Pardon? You ought to have took that three grand Yeah, but that three grand the bloke changed his mind I thought you said the three grand as it stood without the M O T and anything The lad rang and offered Terry three thousand pounds Yeah and his dad came with him Yeah and said he wanted an M O T on it, so his dad offered but he scrubbed his did, he wouldn't let him do it Oh he wanted an M O T, so Terry M O, he get four brand new tyres on Yeah and then say I don't want it Yeah, they, it was them who got us to M O T it What you ought to do was to said to him give me a deposit Mm give me a deposit on it, I get it M O T'd if you change your bloody mind too bad That's right you can pay for the M O T Yeah, that was like in good faith really weren't it, it's M O T So what's happened now then has he changed his mind then? Has he told you he don't want it? Well I quoted the three thousand as it stood, and, but Wayne won't, Wayne won't take that, in fact Wayne says on the phone didn't he tell him to thought he wanted an M O T and Yeah three thousand, the thing is it's got four brand new tyres Yeah twelve months' M O T just to what to pay what the lad had offered it Yeah for it that's how you get Porsches innit? Yeah no ta But the other one didn't get back to me Apparently said said he was gonna ring me last night and he's had plenty of time to ring tonight Mm so he's not bothered either No That surprised me cos they both were keen when Yeah they were looking over it We see if anything happens really The thing is Cool down the thing is, he saw it without an M O T and that lad wanted it, as soon as you've got it M O T'd he don't want it Yeah but he wanted it as well they do waste your bloody time they're I'm going to put I tell you what that's the worse thing about cars, getting rid of them erm I'm going to put in the paper again Friday, Saturday and then Wayne's gonna have to borrow it, it's his problem it's not mine, he's gonna have to sort it out Mm if he's gonna borrow the money and get it The only good thing are at least his tyres Yeah if it's or something like that that's right then I can, I wanted he wanted four tyres? Four, every one, mind you I knew there was Borderline I mean each one was borderline yeah Oh yeah I mean one point six millimetres something like Oh that's right A hundred and ninety three quid for four tyres It is, yeah I know they're all some How much? A hundred and ninety three quid Mm It'll pay, it'll pay Wayne to keep it now until he comes back and Yeah probably so yeah, and at this time of year they're fetching so ridiculous in low money anyway, probably better off in the summer when the lads want to go out, out and about, well they're not bothered now nobody wants to go anywhere do they? So erm He might go and get a loan put it in the bloody garage and forget it ain't he? Yeah it's er I take the car back half term, if, you know, I don't mind driving it down there, but the thing is how am I gonna get back if I drive it down, it's gonna cost me forty pound fifty Well wait until he's gonna come one weekend and you go down there and then come back together, oh why then again you're wasting your bloody, ha He's going away next week Is he? Oh dear that's why he's selling it, he's going away for seven why? Why not sell it? No, but said it oh and then our dad lent you that three thousand when you moved in he didn't lend me three thousand quid, he cut it off the will It don't matter to me, I'm not bothered, it's just, it's just me and you should have this, look, it's his money, I'm not bothered, I've not well you know if I, I said is it gonna cause any problems when he did it, cos it was er, it was er, to me Not with you No not with you No, but it was a loan to me and I said to my dad he was loaning it me and I said to him erm I pay you back and then when I went to pick the cheque up er he says er well me mum says he giving you that you know he says what we're gonna do is when, when they write the will out you'll get that much less than the others, I says well as long as it ain't gonna cause any problems Not with me I'm sure it's not you know and he says no I, I reckon I had a word with our Margaret she said no it don't matter, but if that's gonna be the case I'd rather give it to him back, I mean I've got it Mm she she says it should be you three, me three and well I don't believe that, well and I'll give it to him back then Oh don't say anything I've got the money in the bank, I might as well not after all give it to him not after all this time, he's probably calmed down now, but er if, if our mum and dad give me anything she takes the hump, but mum and dad can give Margaret anything and it does not bother me Funny, a bit like that I couldn't, I couldn't care less honestly Well she always used to say, why you don't say anything, but she always used to say to, she'd never come down to the house, I mean I don't think she's been to my house, house five times She don't it does my house, in fact it come the other day when Kerry had to pick a battery up and I walked out the front with Kerry and he sat in the car and didn't even look at me Yeah yet when you go round to the house he's sociable enough She bought me at my didn't come in, I cannot be doing with that I don't think she's been five times to my house in all the time I've lived there, now in the early days er she said that when it, hang on, she said she'd never come down cos she didn't like er Mm I thought well that's fair comment cos there's people's houses I'd stay away from cos I don't like the wives, so I mean, you know, that's, I don't go round, but the thing is she's been gone about what three year now, four year or something or however long it is why don't she come now? Perhaps our Marg she's just that way oh it don't bloody matter to me A apart from that she can stay away she can come, come round apart from that she can take her choice that would upset me mum and dad, I don't want, they're too old to be upset What? you know perhaps she's mellowed now, I mean the last time she went on with it, about it, was probably over a year ago, but she's still going on about it definitely a year ago not just What to mum and dad or to you? er she's on, I think she said something earlier, well she told me she said something to mum and dad earlier on But she hadn't?

Line three, yeah no, not on this one So you've got yeah goes onto there Aha yeah The first thing to do is change the erm change the cos that, well I tell you what I think the first thing to do is do a system reset if that doesn't change the display decoder I think if that, yeah, if that don't work escalate it, because it's a loan problem, you've done everything you can then What about C P U? Change the C P U? Bloody hell, mm, well I'd escalate it because it's a known problem, they might come, turn back and say change the C P U. Well you know what you can do They're not they're not gonna do anything about it They're gonna ask if you've changed it Yeah they will yeah, well you can have a word with them first, you've got to have a word with them before you escalate any way Yeah but I, I think that's the erm but I mean that's the answer I, shouldn't I, that decoder's got to er It's got to be told something before it does it yeah Yeah , you'll, you'll hear that actually come in, if you disconnect one of those legs, if you disconnect that blue wire on there and then cease the intercom and put it back down again you know the relay clicking you'll hear it come in and go back out again, there you go So the twenty four volts is here permanent Oh yeah yeah yeah I say reset the system, do a system reset and then see how it goes, it's all, it, it er it's the main problem them, and there's no cure for it. We've spent months of shelving and then in the end he just says oh sod it, just took it out for an eight one six then. There is one other cure What's that take the bell off? What can you, I don't know if you ever, ever came across any of these er the mark two that want an extension and I think it would project a producing stuff Mm and it was er Oh acoustics Yeah, that would cure the bastard, cos it would only ring when this rang It would also ring if you pull a page out.

It's lovely! Have you noticed her melon-baller Oh yes, she did. I went through everything with her. She was delighted with it. Mm. Oh did you give her a me a melon baller? We gave her one as well, yeah. Mm. Cos we have one. Oh very yum, yum. So They surely sell them in Dublin though do they? I haven't seen them. I'm sure they do, it's just Mm mm. you know, it's one of those things Yeah. you never think to pick it up for yourself. Mm. No, exactly. You brought a zester didn't you, for Molly? Mm. I think they're a good idea. Mm mm! Gosh this pickled ginger's delicious! Gorgeous! I'm hooked on ginger. Tastes like lime. Yeah. Chris discovered it at Blakes. Really? Really? first of all. So what, what can you do with it? I mean Just have a bit bit with cold meat cold meat roast chicken Yep. pork Mm mm! Molly would love it. So, I can have Yes. And Mikey likes ginger as well Mm mm. doesn't he? Does your mother like ginger? Mm mm. I must give you one and take it for her. And Michael es , and Michael especially. Mm mm. But Cos I do chicken with ginger which Th is really nice. Chicken, ginger Oh do you? and cashew nuts. Oh! You haven't given that to me. With root ginger or powdered ginger. It's root ginger. It's delicious! Very strong. Cos it's very subtle. But it's in a Oh I packet is it? It's actually very subtle. Mhm. It's delicious. So many people when they eat it, they can't actually decipher what it has, you know what it is, that it is ginger. Yes. It's very subtle. I think Margaret doesn't understand the word subtle. Cos she takes about two pounds of root ginger peels it Really? and chops it and puts it with a pound of Philadelphia cheese into the cavity of the chicken outside it's just lightly rubbed with oil Mm mm. and then about two ounces of powdered ginger sprinkled over it. Two ounces as well as all the ginger? And puts it into roast in the oven, and takes it out after fifty minutes and then you get Philadelphia cheese and white wine melt it down in the wine Mm mm! stirring a bit more you know, crushed root ginger Mm mm. and that's your sauce to serve on the side. I tell, you've never eaten anything like it! Is it nice? I could eat the tail. Really? It's gorgeous. But i , I keep saying to Michael it's so expensive! I mean root ginger's like a pound a pound, or two pound a pound. No, not really. It's not, it's not as expensive as it used to be. It's got more and more popular strangely enough. But she does ginger tea. Oops. So do I? Oh I haven't drunk ginger tea before. Well I'll make you ginger tea. Well we never tried that before. But that's sounds what, can I just ask again, so you have a roast chicken yo , and you mix two A pound of Philadelphia cheese. Yeah. But she does about two pound of root ginger. Most normal people would have half a pound at the most. That's two good roots. You crush it or do you chop Two whole, bash it. it up? Bash it? Bash, bash. Yeah. And you put that, mix that in Mix in. with the Philadelphia Into the cavity. Right. And yo then after and then fifty minutes oil it, oil It's the outside as if it's full Yeah. and moist. Put the ground, with the the ground ginger the the Mhm. you know, the powdered stuff. Philadelphia cheese cooked in and Cheese and everything inside. keeping the whole chicken . Mm. Mm. And then roast it. And then after fifty minutes you do the melt the She, well she cooks her chicken for only fifteen minutes, but I would cook my chicken Oh. longer. Yeah. Are we talking about a roast, a whole chicken? A ro , a whole chicken. Mm. Fifteen minutes? Fifty. Fifty. Oh fifty. That's still pretty short Mm. It isn't it? it's about an hour and a half to cook a chicken. But Mm. you could cook, you could cook it for longer with that inside couldn't you? Fifty, fifty and I wouldn't want to eat it. Right. Couldn't you? It's very moist. I don't like overcooked chicken. I like it But that'd be pink? Do you like it pink? So , surely Mm. yeah, it'll still be pink. I thought you had to be quite careful with chicken. Well, you're not gonna be Well we only ever use Marks and Spencers free range chicken. We we used to have these in Dublin didn't we? Can we give this dog Yeah. some chickens? Oh don't! I'll have to try that one in, in Dublin, tell Molly I've been. That sounds wonderful! It's still a good thing to try. Yeah, we do a well of course we,we used to make contact with who, were having a dinner party that we went to. That's why we do all our entertaining one at a time. Why do you only use Marks and Spencers' chickens. Sheila says they're the best in England. Really? She won't have anything else in the hotel. If there's a chicken dish in the hotel chickens don't come from our suppliers, they come from Marks and Spencers. Do Marks and Spencers So you just freeze them do you? obviously you get them then from in bulk from I just . No. What you just go to the supermarkets and buy a whole of chickens? Mhm. Really? That's our extravagance. Excuse me, er, for a moment. Mm. Well she thinks they're far superior to anybody Can I help you? else's. Yeah. The napkins Mm mm! are napkins that we've been buying in antique fairs. Have you? Are they really? Mm. Yeah. They were wonderful! So you probably think I think they starch them though. Oh well I have them ordered. Mm. We have them ordered. Are they nice? They are beautiful! Yeah. They really are lovely. We got about a hundred napkins upstairs . Really? Yeah. The napkins to well cheaper than buying new ones isn't it? Mm mm! Yes. Mm. You get them for two pounds fifty. Four pounds. Five pounds each. They're wonderful aren't they? You go to Peter and pay that for an ordinary Mm mm. Oh yeah. what d'ya call it, kind of Mm. I just thought that was absolutely delicious! Dave has a gorgeous recipe for erm Teriyaki beef. On the menu of Biggs. Oh what's Really? that? She puts the pickled ginger on one side and another, like a Japanese horseradish called Wasabe which is green don't try it, it'll blow your head off! Really? Oh yeah. And th , the, the sort of steak is then it's er cooked like soya sauce Oh yeah. and marinated Mm mm! then it's served in strips. Just delicious! Is, is it expensive to eat Biggs? Really? Mm. Oh I was just thinking, it'd be nice to go there. I didn't think it would be The starters are about nine pounds to in at thirty five for caviar. Really? Main courses are about eighteen to twenty eight. And the puddings make about sixty pounds. So it's sixty pounds each Mm. then? Yeah. And that's for the Plus your booze. Yeah. Mm. And is the drink very expensive? Ya. Her mark-up is about so what I normally do, she has never ever told me to pay for anything. And she says go and have a meal Oh yeah. then Yeah. you know, and if anybody else does, they do but I always insist on paying for my drinks. Yeah. And Thank you. Which one? she obviously didn't know this for a long time and then one day I said to her, well, it was lovely meal and all that but I do think your mark-up on the wine is scandalous! What did she say? Of course I get a staff discount. Really? She says well I know, and you know that that bottle of wine costs Mm mm. ten ninety five and, and we had two bottles last night so it costs us sixty pounds. Well done Michael. Who's making Gearoid pay? Nobody makes me pay for it, I always pay for my drinks. Really? So it was murder! Really? I said I would never go back again I'll help you Michael. No, I'll, I'll do it, it's okay. I'm all under control Are you sure? now. She wouldn't let me pay for it. Really? So fair to say, the staff are depending on their tips to supplement their salary Yeah. so if I don't pay anything Yeah. they've lost that Yes. Right. ability of earning that money Yeah. , so You can't leave a tip regardless? Well , Michael always leaves a tip. Mm. But what we've done now they've agreed to let me pay and I pay cost price for the drinks. Right. So we can drink ourselves silly and get a bill for about ten pounds. And all that wonderful food! Oh that's very good isn't it? I'm looking forward to the sweet I must Mm. say. Mm. Thank you for dinner. Maybe Thursday. Have you got a busy week now Michael? Well Tuesday is my busiest day. I'm getting What? some more in. Oh really? Yeah. That's alright. Cos they're around then? Yeah. And how long are yours away for? Too long. Monday morning, four A M they landed. Oh! So you'll have a an awful week then as usual? Well I'm hoping I'm going to have a nice week but it Mavis , my housekeeper's away until Wednesday so I can't leave the house during the day. Oh right. Because the morning maid goes home at one o'clock and doesn't come back again until six. the gardener comes. Yes. I can't just go off and have a look for somebody or Mm mm. go wandering down the high street can I? Or whatever. No. Mm mm. So Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday I fully intend to . Cos I never ever have time off. I know, you said before you hardly miss a lunch. Never. Which is crazy! I mean, I really do resent it sometimes. I'm not surprised. Yes. Cos it's dark in the morning when I go into work and it's dark when I'm going home in the evenings. It's getting a bit ridiculous! It's getting . And does provide food for you to have? Occasionally. I mean, at the moment there's no housekeeper so unless I actually say to the maid will you just put something in the oven for me? That's it. That's appalling though! And on , on erm Thursday Thursday evening before they were going out to Mark she came home at just about half one. She came and made me a ham sandwich and the maid just look at her to eat it now. Brilliant! There really was not a scrap of . That's awful! Because the housekeeper sorts all that out, so when she's away no one does it? But she bought all these things for me from Marks and Spencers, you know breaded chicken and Mm mm. Mm. breasts. Yeah. I put them all in the deep freeze. Unless you think about it, you know the day before or the Yeah Yeah. morning you come in. But surely you can just defrost it in the microwave? She doesn't have a microwave. Does she not? Why doesn't she use a She doesn't like them. microwave? Doesn't like them. But she bought you one. She get you one. That was quite funny because it was our first Christmas down there and I was saying to the housekeeper that I I wouldn't mind having people come and stay and not a problem because we've got a lovely cooker and we're going to bring our microwave down from . Said it's electric, I'm just going to unplug it and bring it down and put it on the work top. The only thing is that it's chocolate brown and my kitchen's all white. And she did and so I think two days before Christmas Lady said to me, okay I shall go into Peter and choose whatever microwave you want. Just charge it to my account. That's right. What? She said well you can't be carrying microwaves around England every time you want to have a meal. And just, I know that's what, you haven't got one in the cottage and there you are, go and get it. She's so generous isn't she? Yeah. There was no kind of pricing mentioned. I went to Peter and looked at, you know, little ones, and huge ones Oh yeah. and things that did that thing and washing up and all the rest and I thought what am I going to do? Mm mm. Cos I mean I wasn't with her that long. Mm. It was like my first Christmas. And what was considered acceptable and what was considered being bloody greedy! Yeah . I said to the guy, how many of these could I actually walk out with? And he said none. They're all display models? I said what have you got in the so , you know, warehouse on Sloane Avenue in Mm. white? Oh I think that was one of two. The other one was like four hundred and ninety nine pounds. So, I'll take it. I didn't know, I didn't even know what I was taking. Really? I still haven't a clue of what er the the pamphlet, it's far too complicated for me. She's like that. I mean, she's really sweet. Mm mm. I'm very careful never to admire things or enthuse about things. Because she's likely to give them to you? Because she's likely to give them to you. I mean, she knows I love Gardenia Mm mm. and because she was in Mustique and hadn't bought me a birthday present she made sure that there were two Gardenia plants at the party that night she bought me. Really? She's like that. Mm. She knows we love the pink champagne. Mm mm. The brand is in. And it's not kind of standard champagne in the place but she always keeps a supply. Always has champagne. Got any champagne at home? Get another bottle of that. He must be running low. You see I, I mean I know obviously the perks don't outweigh all that, er, at least you do get some perks. At least you know, she can be generous and Yes. But she can be absolutely demonic there's no doubt about that. She really can. Mm. And she drives you insane! Well like you said last time, I think only a man can put up with her. Mm. That's probably why she got through so many women. I think she's on back on the right track as well with her. She was in a rut. Okay. Really? There is more to life than worrying about how the maid's ironed your nightdress or you know. So she does have a housekeeper that lives in? No. Now Molly's been with her since she first got married, you know. She's a big Portuguese man-of-war. And then she has a maid? Who's very bitter. Is she? Why Well is she bitter? well she's had a miserable life of her own kind of thing. She's not married? Doesn't like Sir Mark. Her husband left her. Oh. Doesn't like Sir Mark. I think resents him enormously. He doesn't like her. Oh really? Because, you know, I understand that before he came along she was there you know, and that kind of situation Yeah. Yeah. where you know, well it never used to be like that. Is it Mm mm. her first marriage then? This is the original what? Lady ? Yeah. Third. Oh third! Really? I didn't know that. Number one was killed in a car crash? Really? And her, their children were not two and three years of age. Oh how awful! And the same week that he was killed, Sasha, her daughter was in Great Ormond Street having surgery for cancer of the brain. That's appalling! So So she must have been quite young herself then? Oh ya. She married at eighteen. So yo , I have enormous respect for anyone who actually Mm mm. through something like And so that. she just divorced the second one? Kind of a touchy subject. Oh right. He's Phil , the theatrical producer. Got all these smash hits in the West End at the moment. But, I don't know what the story is. No one has ever said. Any more. On the rare occasion that it comes up she kind of laughs it off and says well it wasn't really a marriage. And just change the subject. So I could of been days Oh. literally. Yeah. So sh Well Sir Marquess across the road it was his first wife who died of a brain tumour and left him with three daughters, as we know. Oh really? . But it was almost inevitable. So where are all the children now? . They have one son by this alliance and he's the youngest. Ah but they're all young adults. Oh so they all do their own thing? So the girl that had Ah yeah. Ah yeah. the girl that had cancer Mm mm. she's alright now? She's fine. Sasha's great! Works at length. And are they nice people? Sasha's lovely. Adorable. Her brother is . Really? But I think that finally . Use all these potatoes? We certainly do. Yes, it that a joke Michael? I think he just well they've got pots of money between them why should I ever do any work? Let them pay for everything, which they do. His daughter's loathe her! Really? Although I think the elder one her but the youngest one is really giving her a attack at the moment. She's just come out of Saint Mary's didn't do as well as she thought, or everybody else hoped she would do in her A levels, so is now retaking one. And she's just an evil little so and so! I hate to say that about anybody, but she really is. Yeah. She conspired to be disruptive. She's a liar. An out and out liar! Really? And I think she's stealing stuff as well. She's what? She's got a huge allowance! She's stealing stuff? Stealing stuff. From the house. Does she still live at the home then? Erm officially yeah. But You know that erm these people Chiddyfort where mum and dad are living and erm Which people ? Oh yeah. And they had fostered a girl because they couldn't have any children of their own as far as I know and and, ah they she's a com , a complete horror! I mean, she's only about eighteen and she, she hates She's got married now though. she hates the parents. Yeah I know. And even about the wedding dress her mother, her mother knew But she's calmed down a lot. her mother knew, her mother that Oh God! if she, if she admired this dress That one ? Thank you very much. Yes. That she wouldn't say anything so, Dorothy had to actually say erm well I really don't think you should go for that. That's awful! And the daughter said, right I'll have that one. But I think they are getting on better now though. She was such a bitch! Unbelievable! This just, just looks absolutely wonderful Michael? Look at the little carrots and everything. This is gorgeous! There. Is this the chicken that I saw earlier transformed into little breaded Yes it is. And the breadcrumbs done by Michael. He's a wonderful little treasure isn't he? Have they got, have the breadcrumbs got herbs in? Yes. Taste. Alright. Mm mm! It's ooh! They're actually MacDonalds MacNuggets. I've thrown the box away. Mm.. They're absolutely wonderful! But tell me Shall I tell you what that's covered with? It's actually a stuffing mix Mm mm! that you can buy here you can actually get it in Harrods as well, and I use as breadcrumbs. It's absolutely gorgeous! Mm mm! There's more gravy here. Anybody? Mm. Just a little. Mm. Right. This is a delicious meal Michael. Thank you very much. It's really super! It's wonderful! It's only chi chicken. The chicken is just Is it? gorgeous! Mm mm. And with a of course the vegetables. Lovely vegetables! Mm mm! Gosh! You've done very well Michael! I don't take any gravy so have a bit more. Do you not? Do you want some Michael? Have you had some? I have some here thank you. At the moment. Okay. Don't you like gravy? That's it. Wo! Thank you. She's had enough. Mm. She'll have had Mm. Anything else? No. Oh I, it could be on, I can't see the red light now, it's gone the other side. I hope we weren't discussing what I thought we were discussing on that Mm mm. tape or you really have to wipe it out. I Know. Mm mm. Cos names The tape ran out during Blind Date. Mm mm. names were named. Mm mm. Do you have it on during Blind Date. Oh my God ! That could really lower the tone of the evening. You had your day. Well I didn't tell you about my hot date on Wednesday. Ooh! I didn't know you had one. Tell me. Tell us. You know I had the choir concert last Saturday? Mhm. It was at a church in Hertford. And we were completely frozen cos the boiler had broken down and we were there at two o'clock to rehearse. And I had one rehearsal of two Bach pieces which were really difficult and I was com , feeling completely frantic during the break in rehearsal, and went over to look at the music and some fellow called Don bounded over to me and said, oh you can't be you know you sh can't be looking at that now, ba, la dee da dee da! He must have heard that I'd come back from Ireland. So, he was talking about Ireland, really raving about it and his name's Kennedy and he's from Liverpool and he likes to think he's got Irish blood in him, he's been there twice this year and Mhm. all that. Really enthusing about it. So we were chatting away about that. And then erm after the rehearsal some of us went off to get a pizza before the concert and he said to me, erm are you interested in going to hear the Mozart Requiem, it's on at the Barbican on Wednesday? So I said, yeah! Co , I've always wanted to hear it, and as you know it's our next concert. So erm that was fine, until after the concert Was that a subsidised concert by were all the tickets one price or not? At the Barbican? I don't know. It was packed! Princess Diana was there. I know. That's it. Really. She was? She was there when you were there? Mm. Mm, I saw her. Mm. Oh really? All the tickets were Mm mm. one price. I had heard What was she wearing? it was sponsored. I read it in the Black and white. paper and thought well that would have been quite nice. Mm mm. Did you go with him? I'll come to that. You said yes did anyway. I said yes thinking Mozart would be lovely, and not thinking any more of it until he stuck to me like a limpet for the rest of the concert and the penny began to drop erm He said something about the tube station not being the most romantic place to meet and I kind of brushed it off by saying well at least we won't get wet there or something. Mm mm. And then he said er, I said to him about I've got to get the last train home. He said don't worry, I have the winter timetable. He's a train spotter. He's got a green anorak with toggles I see. on. And I think it's better Don't! Alright. He's tall but he's tall which is great. No problem. He's in his well actually probably pushing forty at this stage. But, he's got he's got a a big round red face and little eyes and a moustache, and the most peculiar little bit under Bit, yes. there. But really it's just like What colour hair has he got? it's just, it's just like a bit like that But he's nice? which goes Mm mm! But I kept hearing him like scrape it during the concert. I know . But it What col It's ju What colour hair? Erm Does it matter? When you have a lobotomy ! Especially when he's I don't know . Michael , Michael Oh no . Michael's hair colour I suppose. A bit like that. And then he's got he's got a beard, except it's not very long going behind his jawline like Captain Ahab. Do you remember? What? Yes. Yeah. Kind of, out like that. Really bizarre! Weird. Peculiar man. He's head of er he's senior editor of classics at E M I, so he latched onto this sort of, you know Ah. ooh another thing in common, you know da da, da da. And did you So erm I was feeling a bit edgy about this when we were in the pub after the concert cos I thought maybe he's reading things into it and I, you know, I was just going along for the music. So I thought, oh maybe I'm reading too much into it. So I met him on Wednesday evening Tottenham Court Road tube station and er chat, chat, chat. He, he talked so much we missed our stop. In a very loud voice! Did you? Yes. Erm, and he kept touching me as well which really annoyed me! Oh oh! Well, I'm a bit of toucher myself and I, I don't mind if it's friends or family or someone I'm keen on Oh yeah. that doesn't bother me, but considering it was only the second I'd spoken to him and I did not fancy him in the least erm, it really made my skin crawl. And erm first couple of times I kind of didn't respond, and the next few times I was literally flinching Mm mm. and moving away, like, hint, hint. But he liked gripped me on the arm and then his hand would appear from nowhere during the concert, he like kind of rubbed my arm and are you alright? . Oh it was just a nightmare! I, I know I'm a real bitch saying all this. But, you know I think it, I thought it was his dingy grey suit to begin with that smelt of moth balls but it, it was his breath. It was, I don't know how it smelt of moth balls. And he kept guffaw and going, and get this awful blast of moth balls ! Really? It was, it was a complete nightmare ! Oh. And I, I wasn't prepared I wasn't prepared for for it at all Go on. because afterwards I, he had his arm round me when we were leaving and said oh well, I've really enjoyed this evening, we'll do it again won't we? And I pulled away and I said, well erm I so enjoyed the Mozart I've always wanted to hear it. Hint! Hint! I mean what could I do? And then as we approached the tube station the arm around me again and erm and he But was he a fellow choir man as well? Yes! It's awful you see because it's so I would have been, been very rude to him. But no, but I can't couldn't afford to be rude to him, I've only just joined the choir. Well in future whenever he suggests something I think what you've got to do There's some in here. Okay? I've got two here. is never you know, join the breaks or whatever and just make sure you're not left alone Mm. you're with other girls. Well, I'm sorry, he just came on so strong. Mm. And, so I was forced into lying. I said erm I've enjoyed the concert but I'm afraid Yeah. a , er you know, I don't want there to be any. misunderstanding, and he, he said explain. So I had to lie. Certainly. and I said erm, I'm going out with someone. Cos I thought he hasn't taken any of my hints so far. Erm, and he said, oh that sort of un , misunderstanding? And then I thought I'd really put my foot in it and embarrassed both of us Ha. so there was silence until we got to the tube station and he said, how long have you been going out with this man? Said oh I thought oh Becky would laugh if I told her this . Well er, January, I think. Mm. Yes, about ten months I suppose . This phantom. Of the opera. And erm oh he was, oh very lucky man! Blah, blah, blah. I had high hopes of us. Ooh he kept, but he kept I'd even worked out my train to, from Ealing down to Oh no! erm , Strawberry Hill. Blah, blah, blah! I'm sorry but I just think that is outrageous! Well I know. So presumptuous. Say, because I'm meeting someone that he'd plan out his Mm mm. his route. He said, I hope I'm not embarrassing you but I believe in being frank. Blah, blah. And then to my horror er erm we changed to Embankment and he was supposed to go on the district line over to Ealing Yes. And I was going down to Waterloo for my train Mm. he said erm do you mind if I travel to Richmond with you? Oh! What could I say? I mean no was ringing in my ears but I couldn't say that. I mean, yes, I do mind. Erm so we walked in and out of carriages as he sought a pair of seats together and erm squashed down, he had me like penned into the window, like I've got my bag and my umbrella in between ha , and I'd already told him I was going out with someone. He was going like that to my face. Like, I really felt abused. I mean at the time Ya. I felt sorry for him but I must admit when I got home and the following morning, and since then I've felt quite angry about it. That's The next isn't it? the next time you see the girls in the choir I'll bet they'll turn round and say Well I, er, he ca , he was, he was then be careful of whatever his name is. he was then saying erm now what about a concert this Friday? Erm, there's such and such going on. And there's one er a week on Saturday, you know, let's go to both of those and I said erm I'm away those weekends. I said, I'm going away this weekend, I'm going away next weekend Yeah, let's not. and he said erm have you got your diary with you? And I said no. And he said, hadn't you better check? And then he said, I don't mean to put pressure on, but I want to get to know you, we've got so much in common and erm I want to take you out for dinner, not just go to the concert, but, we don't get to know each other that way. I'll come down to Richmond and take you out for dinner, how does that sound? I said, I'll see you at choir. But we don't get to see each other at the choir erm, because you don't stay back for a drink afterwards because you're going to Strawberry Hill. I know it'll be easier when you're in Fulham, blah, blah, blah, but erm pressure! Pressure. Pressure. Pressure. Crowding me in. And then he said Then it's , it's better to have a two-timer from then he said I'm lonely. Marks and Spencers. A lot easier to handle. Sorry Rachel. And then No . he said that I did that for your sister's benefit. I'm not a loner, I'm lonely. He said, I haven't had a relationship since nineteen eighty. I was married for a couple of years in the seventies. Poor woman I've got probably committed suicide! I'm sorry. He hasn't had a relationship since nineteen Yeah. eighty? Did I forget to mention that? Well, I'm sorry, the girls at work just fell about laughing. Nineteen eighty? Nineteen eighty. And I said, oh I'm sure there's someone You ought to join Dateline or something. I said I'm there's somewhere out there for you. And he was obviously really furious that I'd said that . And I thought, yeah well I know I'd be cross if someone said to that me but I don't give a toss actually . You should suggest that he join Dateline and he sounds awful We'll, we'll put him on Blind Date. Shall we nominate him? Yeah . And can you believe it erm I don't believe . Thursday night I was living in dread of the choir. And I trundling along the district line to the Embankment across to Sloane Square and then hello, hello, I didn't expect to see you here. Oh oh! I never met anyone on the tube before from choir. And I'm sure my face was a picture. I was just appalled! I was just thinking about what a horrendous evening it had been the night before and then he confronted me with his awful beard and everything. Oh I dunno. Is there anyone in And I had the choir that lives near you, or sca , can travel with you? Actually there's Paul, the guy who'd given me a lift to the concert and, and he mentioned going to the , the film I saw, erm but I knew he was going to the pub, he always goes to the pub afterwards. So I pa , I told one girl in the choir what had happened, and I think to begin And what did she say? with she thought I was overreacting cos she didn't really respond. Is she married or what? And then , she is married. Er erm and then later on I, I, I think maybe she did realize, you know, cos I said I wasn't prepared for that and that hasn't happened before. I didn't want to think, her to think that I was a show-off, you know Yes. oh I have fun with men all the time, chasing them and that. Mm mm. In my dreams! And er er she, she said to me on the way o , er as I was I said look I'm going to scoot now and she said well I hope you don't get any unwanted company on the way back. And I really felt on edge walking back to Mm mm. the tube station cos I expected him to spring out Well, that's my point you see. from erm, an alleyway or But that man does live near you that can give you a lift. I know, but then I, I'd have Yeah but you'd also have to endure the pub with the other with Don. I know. Well I think the next time you just I mean, go home by yourself next time, you know if there was a I think you've got to make a point of of you know, not being alone with Mm mm. somebody like that around. Mm. He's obviously obsessive. Mm! He's not listened to a word you've said. See he's been married before He said to me as well. I mean he said to me on the train to Richmond erm Stop! there may well be someone in, in the wings but that's irrelevant to me. I'll ignore that, I'm in with a chance. . I think if you feel like that Well there's no way, no way of there being what's his excuse? Yes. Ya. Cos he, he's being rude to you. He has totally insulted you. So I wouldn't feel at all embarrassed. I mean, sod the choir! Okay, you're in the same choir Sod the choir! but he doesn't own it. Plenty of choirs. He's not going to get you kicked out of the choir. If anything, he should be kicked out if he's like that. Mm. Any new girl that comes along is gonna get him leching after her. Who's the choir leader? Er th , we have a conductor called Andy , who is our guest conductor. Alright. But is there nobody like erm you know like an orchestra leader? There isn't er, there isn't somebody who's sort of responsible for coordinating the choir, the choir leaders? There's a chairman. Bu , you know there's a committee with a chairman. But we all get changed in the same room when we're at concerts. And he's . What, men and women together? Yes! I know, I was appalled that Saturday. Oh God ! And obviously The only other maybe I'm misjudging but maybe he was observing . I feel totally embarrassed . I feel awful! God they've got I , you're too polite though. I wouldn't be as polite as you are. Just tell him to bugger off! Yeah I would've done too. Get one of those erm attack Rape alarm Rape things, yeah. rape alarms. And just bleep that when he comes near you . Yes. Absolutely . Honestly! Rape ! Yeah. Honestly! Attempted rape ! You know, if he starts creating a scene then you say that retched thing has gone off again in my bag. You know, d'ya know what I mean? Just startle him. Mm. Cos then you're not going to be Cos if he's not being put off by a boyfriend which most men would. Mm. Well if needs Mm! be, I mean I Gearoid will turn up. Gearoid. Are you nominating ? And I'll play the boyfriend. He's nominated Gearoid. I'll leave my handbag at home. Or I'll , or I'll turn up Oh God ! No it's really sweet of you No what, perhaps what you should do is Mm. one of you should go and pick her up That's what I'm saying. Mm. from the choir one night and you can say to him oh my boyfriend's picking me up and then see how . Or you, bring me over and introduce me. Mm. And I'll say you know, I'll say thank you for taking Anna-Marie to, to the Mozart concert. Mm. I'll have to do it But I think she was very . It was really, it was really , it was really very helpful to her at her choir and her practice that night. Er erm Yes, cos I'm gonna have to make up some rubbish about Seeing him. see my boyfriend isn't too interested in concerts and that's why I've enjoyed coming out this evening. And here, here am I, and then I'll say you know of course I you know I'm indebted to you because I realize that, you know, Anna-Marie is quite prepared to go out with other men if she wants to but I like and make sure it's alright. I'm actually going to join in the choir. You'll be able to take her I can't even have a . . Anna-Marie's told me so much about it . And can you tell me the ta , time of trains from . Yum yum, look, come on over here. And that's what he was like on Wednesday night, he said look as so , more or less as soon as he'd said hello he said erm thirty two and two minutes past the hour, they're your trains. I checked them up. So I thought I couldn't even say look Why? at one like ten past. But he didn't . Well, I would go along and Mm. pick you up and meet you one evening. That's very sweet of you Michael. I must say you He doesn't know where you've told him you're going to be does he? No, don't ever tell No. them. And that's something No. Christine said. Thank God he doesn't know where she lives here cos he'll be round knocking on the door. I know, but the appalling thing is that the address list was given out at the A G M and Christine's phone number is on it. Cos Rachel rang me at work and said I need your phone number. I've been fobbing her off saying, I haven't got anywhere permanent. She said, I need your home number. Well you'll just have to change it when you leave. Give them, give them Hazlemere number or something. Isn't that too far? Mm mm. Sorry er i but who was that, who was that list handed round to? To everyone in the choir presumably. Oh that's dreadful! Oh God! So you really Don't you tell Christine that. Cos she actually said to me, thank God we're not gonna have him bothering us. Well I thought Don't erm I'll have to say I'm Rachel because our voices sound the same. Yeah well just don't let Christine know. Just Mm. just say that Don't erm that's very bazaar don't you Mm mm. think? I think, I think that's, I Phone numbers handed out. no I don't think that's on. Because if you had, I don't think Christine's even got her number in the book. He's got my work number. So that's issuing someone's number. Oh yeah. You know Mm mm. An ex-directory one. Mm. I mean it's one thing letting the committee know for their records or something. Don't tell them you have one. But not just for the Well that's it, I gave it Just say you don't have the telephone. out. Mm. Yes, but when you move to Fulham. Oh! I've just moved into a new flat, I don't have a telephone. Yeah. Mm mm. And stick to it. Yes. And say the other one isn't valid now. Mm. Well just give your work number. Mm. I think that's fine if you give them your work number. That's what Yes but what about work? I've given. I mean you're there five days a week. I know that's what I've given. Mm mm. I'm delaying you now am I? You're not. I thought that meal was so delicious! Mm mm. This gravy is delicious as well! Mm mm. Do you like it? Mm mm. Took me thirty seconds to make that gravy. So what's that made out of? Booze. I chose the booze And has it got alcohol in it? It has. I wondered whether it had. Erm it's made from Bisto, this instant Mm mm. granules. You'd never believe that would you? No. Chicken variety. With Oh right. er two tablespoons of Madeira Oh lovely! Lovely! and some redcurrant and port jelly. Mm mm! Mm. It's absolutely delicious! Well we've nothing to mop it up with. Dab it behind the ears. I'm gonna get Yum Yum to clear mine off. It's good that bottle of gravy. You'd never know it. No that's great. Little trick I learnt years Cos that's nice. Chris does one actually. years and years and years ago. Mm mm. And you can vary it though, if you're having lamb by putting some mint jelly. Delicious! Well I certainly wouldn't worry about being rude to that to Don the train spotter. No, I think there's some people you have to be very blunt to. Donald . Mm. Don . He's, he's an obsessive person. I think his mummy and daddy were poor. Did he tell you? being a train spotter. Who? You did. Who? No, I thought, I thought you meant you'd spoken to him after my date. No,they were on before you went on your date . Left mine afterwards . Mm mm. No he's very odd. Cos I did Does he friends within the choir? I did more or less ignore on the tube journey and the walk to the choir that evening, I mean Mm mm. I'm very aware of Not encouraging him. Yes. So, I I didn't er, I didn't instigate a conversation at all. But it sounds as though he doesn't realize that. I didn't ask him whether he got back But some people are so alright, I didn't I answered in monosyllables. Mm. I didn't instigate a conversation. And then I ran out after the But he probably couldn't believe his luck that he was going out with you that night. He said I couldn't believe you said I mean what happened erm yes straightaway. I was thinking How's that? that's because of the Mozart, not you. In highlighted pen that you know so when he goes out with someone in ninete , in two thousand he'll say to someone the last time I went out with someone was in nineteen ninety three. It's sad isn't it? But I felt sorry for him, I did, but that was my immediate reaction that Has he got a good voice? Yes. He's a good singer? Mm. He is. Well he's obviously musical if he's involved in E M I as well. Mm mm. But he can be, he's very, perhaps a bit bossy in it, and erm may, maybe bitter I feel. Doesn't have a very good sense of humour. Mm mm. I don't think anybody should go out with someone on their own in the beginning, I really don't. Do you not, Gearoid. No. Not nowadays. I don't care what anybody says. Whether it's two Yeah. guys or two women Mm mm. or anything, I really don't think anyone should put themselves in that position. You're better off going out as a threesome or a foursome Yeah. Yeah but if you get asked out but until you for a date, you're not going to say can I bring my friend? By a total stranger? Well I suppose I wouldn't do that with a total stranger. She did. I know, but a stra , what do you mean, what do you classify as a stranger? Someone you don't know Yeah. anything about. I know that they're they're Because I go out they're involved in the ca if in the, erm the choir. Just because you work with the guy But you've never had a conversation with him. Mm mm. Just because you know the guy from Marks and Spencers. I did that with Graham. I went out, I hadn't even I'd said hello to him, that was it. You see, I think that's really strange in this day and age. Yes but you're meeting in a public place. Not like, I mean I was making my way there, he was making his way there and I wouldn't want them to come and pick me up in the car Mm mm. and me go off, I wouldn't do that without really you know, having been out with him a few times. But I'd make Good. my own way there and meet them. In a public place. But if I met, but then that's slightly different because if I met someone in a nightclub or something like that then I would be quite wary. Mm mm. I don't think I'd I don't know I don't know what I'd do. I'd feel quite differently. But something like the choir or where you've been working, I don't know you, I, I've got this thing which is Well I still I think think you, you know you feel safe . that even in something like the choir it's somebody that you should of struck up a, er a relationship you know, over several The intervals. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. And you suddenly, you thought to yourself well you know I actually quite like this chap. Mm. You know, wouldn't it be nice if he had asked me out. And then suddenly the day Mm mm. comes along. Not to sort of well you, you can't be blamed because I mean yo , in the innocent you were actually going because of the concert. I know. You see I ne But he didn't , you know, he, he can't believe his luck that somebody No. as attractive as you said yes he's got this goat beard and this hairy bottom lip! You know, breathe that smells of moth balls, I mean who would have thought of that. And he, and If he were taking several of you out why didn't you say to one of the other girls why don't you come? Did he have a pair of tickets? Cos it was when we were walking down Michael can I have a look please? Oh sorry ! Thank you. Oh sorry. Oh gross! They are beautiful! My darling would you pass me Can I have some more milk? Lovely. Thank you very much. I better not put these on the table. You did very well with these. Interesting. These are the ones that I saw on the Yes but you've got those brown ones that Paula gave you. I know, but I don't wear brown. Which is why . I think it's lovely though with black. They're very Yes. smart aren't they? Well who gave you, did you like Rachel's nice jacket? Yeah. I said that to you. Yes, okay. It brings out Yeah. You see I haven't got any unus , I've got stuff a bit like that, but I haven't got any anything like this. The heel and everything's lovely isn't Yeah. it? You look very dressy aren't you? May I start my chocolate? Absolutely. Don't don't dribble it. Yes. Put it round this way. I thought I'm going to eat some. Mm. Yes because we won't be going After that comes. late tonight. Could you could you pass me the milk please? Yes. My greatest pleasure. Try this. Oh that's nice. Because it's so busy for me. On five in this one? Yeah. Pardon ? What is he actually saying ? And we haven't got a clue. See you've done very well knocking those together. Think nothing of it. Neither do we. Haphazard. One week it'll be all savoury biscuits to go with and chocolate cake. This cake's lovely are you not having any? Yes. Oh yes, Just that I haven't passed her any Oh sorry! cake. Sorry . Oh sorry, sorry, sorry ! Oh well please calm down. Just grab the knife up over head and down at the table. This is a very timely supper. You were tempted to take a knife out of? I didn't have time. Michael was asking about my menswear. But he'd be made-to-measure. But he didn't have any did he? Waistcoats. Oh no! I remember we saw in the other shop It happened again. Do you have any use for your French jacket at all? When did you buy some jackets in France? He . And then we got know the go and get myself out of Marks and Spencers this weekend which for menswear particularly it was very dowdy . And, and we . Snobs! Unlike your shoes Rachel, it's glossed out. No. Oh dear. Was that in the sale, or that was the normal price? In the sale. I've never seen this gentleman . Really? Twenty five pounds is very good. Don't you want some more milk? No. No we'll just pocket the money. But you said that they buy Yes, but they sell, you can buy I doubt it. articles, but they sell them back again. No thank you. No thank you. Sure? No I'm alright. Okay. But then they se , you see they sell those in their staff shop. But I thought it was meant to be anonymous. . It's up to a point . Tell us about your job . I can't stand it ! Aye well Whose , whose mother did you see this morning? Mm mm. Why have you just tipped cream on that?in Cornwall. Not indeed, I recognise it. The Royal Albert Hall. Th the commissionaires on the doorway. But will they be defending . Yeah . That is a West Sussex term . Been teaching it to Hazlemere. Keep your hands close to the dish now Michael. And we just . Getting Michael giggly. No Red Rock's come back. I just wondered if you'd rather pay it back. It is on. Isn't it? Testing, testing, testing . You're not supposed to know . Oh my, I'm not supposed to see. Switch it off now for a few minutes. Okay? Ah ah! I'll leave you with that. The worm. Look at these flowers! So these are lovely! Mm mm. Five cheesies to one slurp of drink. Hmm mm. Why is it pure gin? I think Ted would be proud of me. Well, my stars say if you find yourself at a low ebb this weekend don't worry. Every so often we all need to wind down. There you are. If your a little numb, cynical, or apathetic it's probably a healthy sign. we do like it Yeah. and we thought well one night, I mean it's a bloody big radiator in that room Mm. which I think would be enough You wouldn't you'd probably find that you would use it half a dozen times through the year. Yeah, yeah. No I won't get rid of mine. Have you sort of not, I suppose you haven't found out money- wise what it's costing ya? No, not really I should imagine it's not, I don't know you see, we don't, we'd of had the heating on anyway Yeah. so I don't suppose it's cost us any more No. because we've hardly had it on. Mm. Still you You do find it warm don't ya? I do, yeah, Have you got a couple of settings on yours is it a high and a low? Well I've just got high and low that's all. But I mean it'll give you er a wattage er, whatever it is Yeah it pumps out anyway? well I suppose so, I don't know what we've got. The yeah, because as I say something like what Jane's got would fit in that fireplace, just right Mm. Mm. which like I say saw one up at erm I told you that fireplace shop on the corner, mind you I think we'll get Edwards in, he had some in about a hundred and sixty quid or so You should start looking round. erm I mean really ideally Mike would like one of those that actually fits perfectly Yeah. in, in the fireplace I know what you mean. and it's got a back to it Mm. and it sort of throws the heat out into the room. Yeah, yeah. Well I could, it could, it wouldn't justify it. But Chris I can't see them I can't see them making a fire like that that your heat's gonna go all up the chimney, no way. No, but what I'm saying is Josh come on if there wasn't come on Josh, Josh if there wasn't a good amount of radiator in that room Josh it would justify having a fire like that Come on Yeah, yeah. but because it's got such a good Yeah. Radiator. you know cos I told you Mike actually fancies one of these that actually fits right in the fireplace I know what you mean next door and there's a backing to it and it pumps it out into the room, they're dead hot Yeah. but I don't think this room needs it Jane. No. Mm. I think it'll be a waste, and I don't want to go to the expense of Well they are bloody expensive. because It slipped I think the fires are about three hundred quid Mm. but it's not that, you'd have to have a lot of the fireplace ripped up. Mm you would Yeah. it's only a little square. Yeah, we'd have to have the pillars taken off Yeah. and everything like that, so all that would have to be redecorated. Whereas like that one of ours, it'd be ideal wouldn't it? It be it just work right Must have your chimney swept. That's what I want to get that number off you for that as well because I some would suggest anyway I got it somewhere yeah. wouldn't he? I got it somewhere, I'll root it out for ya and I forgot to see Hilda about that Michael shout Mike There's no rush for it. Michael shout louder she's gone on holiday now. you know, some time Yeah. if you think about it. Mike Funny enough I saw her yesterday in a minute or two and she started talking about putting the freezer in the back garden Is it worth my taking a coat on? and that Oh. and it just slipped my mind. Well just any time, we won't be doing nothing until the end of May anyway. Michael, Michael shout Mike As soon as she comes back I promise I'll ask her Mike, shout Mike, Mike But what would you, see Edward said shout Chris when we decided we want something he'll come down and Be careful sort it all out. sort it out shout Chris Hopefully we can get away with that room Jane with just maybe having to emulsion it Yeah. because I mean once you've taken all the pictures down, I think it did need it She's a smoker int she? That's very much. Yeah that'll be your main thing then. Rather than decorate I think we'll just Paint it. er emulsion over it and maybe put a border around the picture frames. This is in the back room? Front room. Mm. Yeah, leave the front room, we'll have to, first week or so we'll have to live in that back room Yeah. until we've got Mike, Michael shout Chris, he does say Chris It's quite an easy one that, int it? say Chris, it's not that he can't though Madge, he just won't No. I've heard him say Deana and Stacey Mm. Yeah. loads of times, he does moan mumma now he does that quite a lot but that is the only thing he says da, oh no Catch this. you'd better not have that had ya?

He's alright like that, last night, once he went to sleep I sort of like staying around in his room for a couple of minutes, but I, went and opened you know, sort, sorted the curtains out and Mm. once he's asleep that's it Yeah. and I think it's just getting him that way, come on shall we put your our Linda was the most terrible child Really? she never slept and our Edmond used to be worn out It does get you down actually. Oh aye that's why we moved from our house she had me up, had played bloody hell over it, no bugger was getting no sleep Aye. so we went out and bought that house in Maddors Road Oh. that's how she first got that Ee, ee, ee I can remember having when she went in to have our Pam and er I thought on the Wednesday afternoon had a bloody good walk round Tire her out.

Mm well if I'd known enough company she said, I'd have been at home with me feet up you know But your mum wanted to see the film did she? Well obviously she didn't really Mm, anyway to me on the way out, oh I really enjoyed that and we were crying our eyes out. so she's glad she went in the end? Mm the last sort of six months Mm that'll be nice won't it? So you perked her up a bit Well so when are you going away? I don't know I've got nothing to wear, you know I mean there's When's the kids going out tonight? Mm, when I've dropped them I won't see them now till Sunday You've dropped them off from, straight from school?

No it's normally from Saturday morning till Sunday morning I just think we'll end up going for the day but he said, he's got Gerry coming up from Hull to mind the shop on Saturday, he said oh you're tired and you need a change and a rest he said something like erm Do you think he'll stay over Saturday night? then we'd have to be back for eleven, can't, I don't know what's gonna happen to the dog Oh right, oh can't you take her, oh no you can't really can you? You can't right and you don't know what to do I tried to for the best Well I do know what I want to do, but it's knocked me for six cos I sort of felt really guilty Mm sort of you can't kick them while they're down and Yeah, but you do it, it were a good time though. Mm heard something on the radio, he said, oh will you still love me in a year's time, so I looked That's how I am, horrible to him really it's worse than being married. So when're you gonna tell him, when're you gonna do it take the bull by the horns? Yeah I can still see you in flaming two year's time simply because you're too frightened to say anything to him, to my son. hello you don't give yourself time to wake up before you start moaning Say not her again oh look, he's such a cutey Urgh hello got a bit warm under there I was gonna say he's got rosy cheeks I know, it's alright when the sun's out, but when the sun goes in it's freezing so I've had his plastic Mm he was a little git last night. Well no just screaming at the top of his voice, our Ben had to bring him down in the end and give him a drink and start again, even then I had to stay with him until he went to sleep Ah this all started after last weekend Deana put him to bed didn't she? Instead of letting John's mum do it, consequently he got dead upset so Oh so he was dead annoyed with it, all week I've been struggling to get him to bed he, he was a treat before, just used to take him up, give him a cuddle, say night-night and that was it So why did it disturb him with Deana? Is it just Well I just it's not like an adult? Yeah I suppose so, yeah It seems, it's comforting is it? It's the same routine Yeah, of course you can't sort of cuddle him like that cos he's too heavy, I rock him you know for a, a couple of minutes, not that long, he's taken his braces off as well still do, don't ya? Mm Ah look at them there, I don't know, I don't know what you're gonna do, cos whatever it is you're not doing it, it's just letting time go by aren't ya, treading water if you like. Last night I got really upset, I did in bed and erm he kept saying what's the matter? What's the matter? And you have and everything, yeah Mm but he'd just told me about the housing with the car and everything. Is it, is he, is that right, is somebody coming down to value the house? No, just coming back home to show me the flaming car, and that's what sa I didn't but I feel dead awful really, but I didn't jump up and down I'm not surprised, I'd have done me fruit, if I was going around with somebody that, that say they're gonna put the house on the market for me, want to make a go, a go of the marriage, a new baby, two other kids and then oh, but yet, yet wants to play around in a, you know a little sports car, that nobody but two people can sit in I know I can't that's the weekend only and there's me Well he's got so many debts Lynn it just doesn't seem right he's, he's living in cuckoo land, I mean when are you ever gonna feel secure with somebody like that? Never You can't can ya? Is there any more tea in the pot Jane at all? Yeah there might be Well thanks that was beautiful tea,sort of ready for it I'm not surprised with all that dashing around, he asks such a lot of you Lynn and I can't understand why he's like that when he says he loves you and everything, and he wants I know I don't know why I'm being so bloody docile no I really have and then I don't know he's gonna come a right bloody cropper I keep burning , I bet I didn't, I thought, pardon me, positive mm I popped round, I went in yesterday I'm going to say something and then he's going on about well I've sold me car to pay the mortgage and And then all he tells you is a pack of bloody lies I know if he can lie that bloody easily well he, he said he, he wanted it as a surprise well it's not a surprise for me is it? Yeah, but he knew you wasn't you wasn't keen on the idea anyway didn't he? Well that's right, yeah, cos then he asked me ages ago did I think he was being selfish, I said yes Mm I said, but like you tell me it's your life, mm he's like a Jekyll and Hyde that bloke, I've told you before you wanna be bloody careful how it works out and then he said to me how, how do you feel about your baby now? Not, you know, and I said okay? It's going to be his baby when it's a good baby I know but your baby when anything comes to actually buying for it and er looking after it I would imagine, I can't see him doing all what he says he's gonna do with it Lynn No Oi you, he's playing with your Oh let's have a, is it in there? no right, we'll have another cup of tea and then we'll have that nice cake Right look at you, eating all your crisps look it's going to rain I'm gonna go and bring my pushchair in then before it does, are you taking that with ya? Or just Yeah, I'm going to, I'm just working out I'll be back in a tick mm, mm So you've still got your other have ya that Alice had? Mm, well it's at erm Carl's and Yeah but you could use it like when mind you, you might be pleased with it when it's Mm, I'm damn sure I will, I quite like doing things like that Yeah very but they remember which one I did, I think it was that Mothercare one they get grubby with the things and everything and it was a sunny day and I went outside with me bucket and me felt and me scrubbing brush Yeah and I just, I threw buckets of water on it to rinse it, and it dried because it was really warm and it came up like new Came up like new cos you can have a real good go at the wheels that way outside Yeah, outside, it's like my pram, I mean, I was, Stacey was going in hospital last year to have her adeno adenoids out and Sue was having him and I thought well, he was too big for his carrycot, but take the pram down and he's got nothing to sleep in and er, I put him in it, it been six months since it was do well since he started using it, so I give that a good going over and the pram wheels come up lovely I know you know I get a Brillo Yeah and some Jif on it, but erm, it's not been done since, so when the next good bit of weather, I've got to get the pushchair out and give that a good going over And do that and me pram as well I know, I fancied a big pram, but there you go Well it's, whether you've really got somewhere to put it really that's the top and bottom of it Well there's nowhere to walk to now, is there, you know Well where would you, mind you I suppose like in the olden days you could only get big prams, they just had them in the living room didn't they? Yeah, well it'd just have to go in the hall, but, no, this will be better, carrycot and that,ridiculous prices though Well it is, it's different if you was, if you was starting from scratch I suppose you know, first baby you're inclined to, you want everything new don't you with these new Well I sort of said to him as well about, I said and it's ridiculous, just because I said the bedding had been lo in the loft Mm with the cot and everything he, he sort of er thought it was Well some lofts are lovely aren't they? I mean our loft is a right mess grotty I mean they're all in bin bags Mm they only need washing , I mean I might be wrong, they might have, they might have gone funny, but I doubt it they've not been up there that long really only about two Oh all of my stuff has been up in the loft it's like you say, I mean if they've been double wrapped and everything and you wash them he should put his hand in his pocket really and buy something Of course he should, you ought to just ask him for say a hundred, you know to buy a couple of packs of nappies and some cream and changing mat, a changing bag, you'll want all that won't you? I know a changing bag could cost sixteen Fifteen sixteen pounds and then you've got another six or seven pound for a changing mat you wanna say to him, that you know, can I have er, some money, I want to start getting us a few things together, but you, I mean, what about clothes? I know, he, he said er, he said about, plus when I mentioned the pushchair and the carrycot he said oh well , so I said yeah Yeah I said that development, I said,with the bargain coming up with a He alright? Yeah he's alright there oh I just Ooh, you've made a right mess with them crisps young man, ain't ya? The thing is Lynn you've got to start early Well it's all part of the, of the process of getting ready for it though int it? Yeah where've you got these from? Er the deli, you know in the village Oh they should be nice then you might need a, get a fork to eat it with, you don't mind, you might need a fork because Oh right are these of, what did you have, is that what you had before one of these with the bits of carrot on Yeah, but you might, I can't remember whether you really liked it and I thought oh Oh I did yeah. So it was the deli not that other place, because there's er, a, a little cake shop int there in the village? Near where, next to I know where where the new florist is? Yeah, I know where the erm the delicatessen is, so you got them from there and not the other shop, cos No I've been in is it it's opposite erm, yeah not Parker Radburn what about Lingraves do they erm? No they've gone, it's a florist now Oh really, I only went in there the other day, well the other week about a fortnight ago I know cos I know when, when I got these when I came, about two weeks ago Ah they were in, I know they've been there years You know what's done it, I suppose Parker and Radburn going in there Mm and they just about managed didn't they with the ? cos they sell different sort of Mm, me and John had a, er one from the Spinces the other day very nice What, yeah they're oblong aren't they? Yeah you can have my, would you like my carrot? You can take it off Er will, will Michael like it? No it's marzipan int it? Yeah right, erm thank you very much You like marzipan do you? Mm Yuck, yuck, I like almonds and everything but You just don't like I just don't like marzipan, I think it was something that to do when I was a kid to be honest They do another sort and that's really nice, it's called a nutty Vera and it looks like this but it's a similar texture, but it's a different taste, it's got walnuts on the, bit on the top Oh and what it is, the man that bakes them, it's a that makes his Mm and he's related to Vera Duckworth out of Coronation Street cos it's Oh it's because something like that Oh so he's done one after her, a nutty Vera. I bet that's nice That's what she said anyway with nuts on instead of erm Yeah d'ya know I could drink and drink and drink you know there only you get all the fingers caught, it's like with an ironing board int it? Oh God, yeah It's like looking at another planet to a man that's right what's that? Is that marzipan? That is isn't it? Yes it is, I'll have to dig that Ah and it's everything just to stop you getting at what, well get it then yeah, I've, I don't mind some of it, I've not had a bit of marzipan for I don't mind these erm almond slices, I quite like them, but I think it must be the texture of the marzipan Mm, I love it, they do erm, German erm marzipan bar, chocolate bar Oh aye have you ever made marzipan? No I did it in the sixth form, it's really hard, it takes ages Does it? That's why I would think, it's ground almonds they're expensive That's right, yeah it, and it doesn't taste anything like, I mean this'll be probably be home, nearest to homemade, but that Mm bright yellow stuff it doesn't taste like that at all No it's, sort of very more of Here a subtle taste, you know it need loads of ground almonds Mm just to make a small oh That come off rather easily, would you like my marzipan? Hmm, well leave it there and I'll see how I go, cos I've had one carrot and I, sort of like, I had your carrot and I'm putting mine quite rich though that's the thing, I quite like that bit there cos that's like brown sugar erm It's lovely Carl started me on this, he was into carrot cake for years and Yeah? mm and it's similar to a cake we used to have when he used to love erm when we were engaged he introduced That's another name for it int it apparently Oh is it oh it was the same, but it was taller, and that sort of buttery cream that was all on top and that had nuts and things Mm rather than we had, I told you, at this meal we went to, on Saturday they had erm carrot cake, but that was completely covered in like this cream cheese Mm sounds nice, mm it was gorgeous but Chris was saying that Tescos do one, but they call it passion cake which is the same thing Oh the same, mm like a horse today, drinking Have you got a sore throat or something or just thirsty? I don't know catarrh but er I've been thirsty the last few days I remember we used to just fancy Mm go and buy one and dash in with a cup of tea and he I hoped no one called and no one it's more satisfying when you're desperate for something and you get home Mm and gulp it down You're getting in a mess Michael do it now, have you ever tried, bought, what, you can buy it in a slab can't you, but without the cream on No I've not seen it like can buy it the, just carrot cake no, no, I've only just got onto Oh There, I'm not too keen on the creamy soft piece Mm, I like that You're a mess, mm oh that's not too bad, you know What were ya? One thirty over eighty How much weight have you put on? Well she weighed me with me boots, er everything on and on their scales it was nine stone eight. What are you doing? You're not having it I'll have me mouth round the tap in a minute not quite the same there's that bottle there where did you , is that what you meant the bottle? Over there by the er red basket Oh right can you see it? Yeah That marzipan on its own is filling though int it? Yeah, well I I can't eat any more oh dear Was there enough? Oh God you've only got a little bit No I've just filled up there Oh I know there must be something wrong with me come on in the other room Michael, right, now you've got your dummy Oh Pardon me, hmm, ooh that's better, that's all I do is burp With all that liquid I'm not surprised can you watch him with that tin? You monkey Okay monkey, monkey, moo, yeah just put some water in the sink and we'll go and sit down, I'm not bothered about washing I just don't like it when it's stuck to the plates I know what you mean, it's harder to wash when it's Mm dried on, so you might as well That's it do your sweeping Oh that's it do your sweeping up, is it raining? it's just a bit in the air, but you can tell it's going a bit damp now anyway Mm what will you do, be able to go into the hotel to make your butties into your room and do it, or We shall do them before we go out in the morning Yeah cos it's only that's a good idea. er, it's only er breakfast but I believe they're very good breakfasts Mm. er and you can have as much as you want I believe Oh you can help yourself there. so I said well ha, ha, gonna be cheeky Get your extra bits of bacon and take 'em away I'm, I'm gonna get a packet of freezer bags Yeah, you want to and er, put one, just put one in me handbag in the morning and yeah if I see anything on the table I'll just pop it in a freezer bag yeah, you can have it for your dinner with some, with your barm cakes can't you? Yeah so I thought oh well I'll see what there is Good idea you can have bacon and egg for breakfast and bacon butties for dinner Yeah, well you never know do ya? a good idea Ah, ah, ah, ah, no, no, no Thank you where's your brush? Where's your brush? Here are, there it is. There it is, go and get your brush. Get your brush and brush up for mummy there yeah these places you can get quite a good discount for being Mm for staying there for your dinner Well I, I'd never thought of taking anything like that until she said, cos I, well you never pay, it's all new to me, I haven't done it before and she said oh no she said we take these small tins of stuff with us and er make our sandwiches, cos there's a supermarket I believe not far from there Yeah you can go and get some barm cakes yeah that'll be nice, different Yeah they have different sort of rolls to us as well don't they? Yeah That'll be nice on your travels you ought to see underneath the fridge, he does this in the kitchen and they've all gone under the fridge, when you're at the top shop or any other places where the will you have a look on the cards in the window, I'm looking for a slide, you know, but a smaller one for him for the garden for the summer really, cos that's just about had it that one ? Cos you can only use them up to about four I would think cos other, other than that they get a bit too big for them don't they?he could do with a little slide in the garden he will, Christmas I'd like to get it sorted out a bit for him really before the summer starts It'll be ideal Mm if you can just fasten him in the back it'll be smashing won't it? Well there's the gate, he can only go so far with the gate anyway, so it won't really matter yeah yeah you ought to see all the pegs at the back of me fridge Go and watch daddy bring the tree down? Watch it Michael, it's coming yeah, oh you have got hiccups? He's had them quite a bit these last few days , they seem to come like that don't they? Mm Then he'll go a month probably there we are it's down Oh, fence nearly came with it it'll seem funny won't it to see that tree down? I do think it's lightened this room up though when you think it gone Yeah I mean it's better when you took that one from down there wasn't it? Oh yeah Yeah yeah the only thing about having those others of course you can see through the windows, but there's not a lot you can do about that. John had a word with the bloke across the back there Oh did he? about, you know the garage? Yeah So he said he'd got no objections to John moving it back Oh well mm we'll probably end up doing a bit to the garden this year as opposed to er you know going to, we were gonna go down to Somerset in June weren't we? Mm But that, with things as they are we might as well just hang fire Well, it's no use spending money you haven't got is it? No, well the thing is I mean you're talking of five or six hundred pounds This is it and if you can't replace it I mean we've booked, we've booked through, erm,Au August anyway, we're definitely going in August to Southport and it might be a little bit cheaper for yourself than going all that way, it certainly won't, it certainly won't cost you as much to get there anyway No, well that's it int it?so er if things are reasonable we might just go away for a long weekend or something, go find us a place in Southport for a weekend Yeah but really I mean you need the odd week at home don't you really to sort of do bits to it, you can't work and do it Well I mean I'm not going away this year, but it's not really bothered me an awful lot No no so you can't gone to erm, oh I think I told you didn't I? Yeah Gone to Windsor today that's right and a day Eastbourne tomorrow, now that's a nice little break Mm just, just a few hours like that yeah see some places you see go from Friday to Monday don't they? That's alright, I think that's ideal Yeah I think it's a good time to spend in the garden to be honest, I mean you can't, you can't, it's not really long enough to try and do it at weekends, not if he wants to move that garage back, it'll probably take the best part of the week to sort that out Oh it will yeah, cos you've got to empty it and That's right move your swing haven't ya and yeah everything, yeah and prepare the ground Yeah I don't know whether that swing will end up going to the tip if it comes down, it's a bit rusty int it? Seen better days Just depends if the frame's strong Yeah you know you could always put a bit of paint on it mm to stop the rust, it just depends if it's strong enough to hold them, the frame mm, it's done well though, I mean You might, you might get a little something out of it for Michael Mm, we haven't got a seat on it Oh dear I don't know what happened to that one that granddad made Deana I know is John going to the tip with all this tree? Mm me broke as well Oh God it's alright having two, you never get two for twelve months Oh it's erm, it's not too bad this time of year, you can peg out, the legs come off it, you know that brown one that you bought me? Yeah I mean I've had it since, I remember getting, washing me nappies and putting them on there Oh I bought that one when Deana was a baby Yeah, it was before Deana was born was it before Deana was born? Yeah cos I remember, I was doing hang all me nappies out before she was born, so I washed them all and put them on Did ya? Yeah, so that was er,eleven years ago aren't ya? Yeah And it's been used constantly, so it's not done bad, it's the way, the leg's been wiggly for a while, it just broke off the other day, so, I don't know whether John can mend it, he couldn't seem to think he can No they're not er, I've got one that's got a rivet come out Mm on this side, you know where the little piece that, that bend, that you uncatch it to fold it up I know what you mean yeah the rivet's come out Yeah and that, I find that very awkward, I've got a rubber band round it at the moment yeah but you see that only lasts so long they, they perish yeah, done well, I might re come winter I'll probably replace it, I won't bother now it's not worth it with summer says she having a nice summer Yes, well, we're bound to have something aren't we? Well I should think so We're bound to have something We live in hope don't we? Yeah What are you doing? Mind you don't your tongue with that I tell you what they had in er Woolies market as well, I don't know whether you've seen them and I don't, I've not got you know an old Argos catalogue to compare prices, cos they've not got it in the summer one, but they have them in the winter ones, it's like a, a tool box, but it's on wheels and you make it up, you, you know all the screws and the wheels come out and you're not, it's all plastic, I think it must be from age three, because of the little bits, and it's like erm, I've seen it somewhere, where I've been, it has little figures sat in this erm, what would you, it's like erm, a bit like a truck, yeah, and it's got the, the figures in it I haven't I haven't actually seen one, but I once saw a lady on the bus with one if it, on the bus you can see it's quite a big thing isn't it? Yeah, yes Yeah on the box you can see it made up and then with all the bits and pieces separate Mm and I think it was something like, say twenty pound, it was on the market, but I have a feeling it was something like thirty odd Good boy, good boy, thank you, no we're not taking them out Ooh cheeky, you are cheeks all over your face I don't think you should be chewing that one Michael cos if you, if you open it up it'll stick on your tongue int it? Yes you think I can't see you just cos you're behind me. Trying to stick it onto your jumper You'd have laughed at him yesterday with his boo cos even John, you know, I mean, he heard him it was Yes as clear as anything, boo he says Yeah and boo again and then that was it, he co he wouldn't do it again It'll perhaps come all at once Yeah, he's, he's into ev oh it must've been about six or eight weeks ago he started saying a couple of things and I thought oh he's coming now, but it stopped I think I got excited when he started saying dark, but that's as far as it got, int it? Dark, is it dark? Dark. Is it dark not dark No he says it's not dark yet not dark not dark You're not fooling me Not fooling me do you mind mind you he does say mama now when he's moaning, it's definitely mama, he says now, if he wants something, mama, er, er, mama your skin Ow that's sharp , put it in there now please, put it in for mummy Yes, he knows it's funny yes, in there, in there, put it away Mine, mine That way they're saving money on a night out, they're gonna save on er actual depot hours, where it's like taking us sort of like ten and eleven hours, it's only gonna take them eight, nine to do that cos they're there, they're on top of the job. Mm, either way though, I mean the thing is if they do, you, you would be in for a little bit of something, if you hung it out till be, to being redundant Yeah, but I mean it's like, it's but having said that if ifs were ands, and ands were swings Yeah, then you I know, but John I mean you'd be up for a good couple of grand if you did stick it out. I don't know. You would Two grand's not everything Jane, you know that and I know that what, what I propose to do anyway if it's agreeable to you Hand it in and see what happens. give 'em a go, let's go and sit and listen to what the bloke says Mm and let him sit and listen to me mm he might turn round and say I'm sorry Mr you're not suitable, alright, I've not lost nothing mm you just had, you've just had a bloody, you've had a off work The thing is I mean if you turn round and just say to them well they're messing about with all the hours we've put it down to the erm Recession. recession, but it's just the, I think it's just a bloody good excuse to streamline a company that's Oh it is you know I mean they, they do don't they, they overstaff and then they've got to cut back. Look at look at Llandudno Mm. one of the factories, they're shutting it Yeah but and where're they moving it? It's going yeah, but when to Creda. when was it built all them factories it was built in the seventies when the boom was in I agree, I agree, yes I agree, that factory's old, it's out of date, it wants a lot of modifying so now there's so they've got it's just a good excuse to streamline yes all the staff. yeah, you see Creda now at are already making some of the washer driers, that Llandudno used to make. Mm, what gets me is how Creda they're gonna, they're, they're coming up in the pink and They've got job security Jane But why haven't Hotpoint, the original Hotpoint drivers, I mean Hotpoint is the bigger firm Yeah, but having saying that Hotpoint take over Creda Yeah where are all Hotpoint's drivers? it's like, yeah but it's like, it's like any big conglomeration int it, if, if I was to buy you out as a company you're gonna You'd have to keep me sweet you're, you're gonna say to him well there's conditions attached to this Mm I've, I've, those lads have served me well mm I want them looking after, and cou and you're gonna, I'm gonna say to you you're gonna go to your ordinary man I'm gonna say to you yeah, alright, I'm, I thank you you're thinking long-term, yeah I can do this and then when it, a gentleman's agreement and then it comes to paper, and when that paper's signed you're stuck with it Yeah and I tell you what, this is, this is what I think's happened Probably has, yeah. being truthful do you know what I think'll go next? What? Manchester? the double holiday pay Yeah I was thinking that actually and the profit sharing well the thing is they've I gone down anyway on the basic rate d'ya know they've, well this is it, the profit sharing and the holiday pay as you say they've yeah d'ya know the profit sharing's up to thirty one percent, thirty one hours up to now and there's another one, another one to go in yet Is that good or bad? I mean I don't know very much about It's better than what we had at Christmas How come? How come? I don't know, but they tell us that they're not flogging anything Mm, just a good excuse int it? so who's, who's who's telling porkies here? That is it John that's it thing I, I mean the thing that I can't understand you've, you've always been You know I've never, I've never batted an eyelid have I? No you've always done what they said alright everybody has I've always, I might've had a little moan, but I've always to myself Yeah, but everybody does, yeah but everybody has a, in your job John everybody's entitled to a bit of a moan I've never done it in the office, I've always gone, I've always probably gone in the canteen or in the of in the, in the wagon thing Mm. bleeding hell You don't have any time off and yet I'm being nailed mm and look what he said on Friday, I wanted on main lines he said, but you're not one of them and you're not getting a new motor Is that what he said to you you're Yeah not getting a new motor? that's what he turned round and told me. Did you ask him why? Well what can I say to him Jane, it's his property, he put, he gives the motors to who he wants, he's, he's the transport manager, I can't argue with him. I know, it's not fair though is it? I'm cutting these steaks in half John, cos we've got one fatty one and one that's alright. So I mean, if Jane, if it's such a good job why are all these people leaving? Oh Eh? Think of it like that Yeah I know why are these higher, you know Nick who used to be in Manchester? Doing the, the mail order Mm I saw him er he went didn't he? He went to Grangewell he's running Grange now he said d'ya know something For Hotpoint?

I mean if you stick it out with Hotpoint and hope that the hours come back, if the hours come back you're gonna be earning a lot more money aren't ya? Yeah but you see if it's This is it I know ifs and ands I know I mean look at Colin Jane, he got it made at, at mm take your bed there, now I know that mm take your bed there, money in abundance, even in this recession, well yeah the work's there, no problem, he just got a big new contract for some oh not Federal, give me another big haulage contractor, oh I can't think, T N T T N T? you know T N T, Taylors Nightly Trunk Is that what it is?

Yeah, but the one that I, it's got all her latest stuff on, is just called Cher that's the one I was after, but I don't want it now, I told ya It's a bit bloody late Oh you've not bought it have you? Told you not to John it's a lot of money. Shut up Which one did you get? Heart of Stone I've only ever seen one and the one that, the recent one is called just Cher and that's got all the last, the last few top ten hits on it. Can't you change it? listen to it first and see what you think. No I don't want to. Oh I'm sorry, but there was only that one which is all, it's got her latest stuff on it, I'm not really keen on anything else, it's got those last, you know the sort of her last few records of it, on it I should say I didn't know there was any others around, when I told you I wanted the Cher one, it was the one that was out now not the old ones. This one's out now . No, what I mean is er the new one sort of thing, the new Cher, it's in the top thirty, it was about number three a month about a month or so ago I didn't know there was anything else Well have this one and see what else develops listen to it, you might like it.

I told you what I wanted Pissing me off now you. It's no use getting in a huff about it there's erm Don't bother Jane don't bother Ah it's your favourite word that don't bother. there's no point in going on about it now is there? I said not to spend any money, I said just get a little box of chocolates, that was all, finish. Shut up and since when did you ever listen to me? It's not that I was worried about, it was just the money, it's a lot of money for something that, was an idea a couple of months ago. You really know how to cheer people up don't ya? I'm sorry I told ya and not only that I bought that camera the other week didn't I? What was Sandy saying to ya? What about? I don't know I wasn't there, you was talking to Sandy over the fence. She was asking what Steve had come up with job wise she said if ever I wanted a C V writing Graham'd do it for me Good idea won't be a bad idea mm, what I thought was the tough steak has turned out to be the, the one that's not I cut the steaks about a bit, one was a bit fattier than the other the one that I had I thought would be dead tough, is tender it's int it?they look more like a sirloin steak to me than a rump, even though it went under the name of rump it looked like you can only tell the shape of it can't, oh God D'ya want me to go? No, I put Who was that? Jane What she want? I don't know if you remember but ages ago, round about October time she borrowed some stuff for the Brownies, for erm, for Sian, Sian was going camping and she hadn't got shorts or anything, so she borrowed it off me, I was thinking of Stacey starting, I wanted the t I'm not bothered about the shorts, but I want the T-shirt and I'm just gonna get Stacey the culottes and she can wear her shorts and the cardigan with it buy, when she first starts and then we could, Deana's moving up to Guides this, so she can have that sweatshirt of er, I mean they're nine pound Mm. it's no good buying another one, she's not gonna need it in the summer is she? I've cooked these steaks too long, trying to get them brown. Will you do me a favour and keep the receipt and everything for that C D and the bag that it's in? Sandy must be having company, pulled the blind down I think that's why they've been good about the parking this week, cos I mean Irene's pulled her car, we saw Irene pull her car in was you here when she I saw her get in it, it must of been teatime yesterday No. she got in it, pulled it forward and put it in. Perhaps she's got the message. Hmm, I doubt it somehow and then Derek put his in and then Paul parked up where Eileen was Paul was waiting to get out So well Paul come out, I was talking to Steven and he said I come home last night and he said I couldn't park me bloody car up cos there were cars everywhere, and they were all theirs. Who said that, Paul? Mm. I didn't think he parked here last night. Well he was when I come home from work. What last night? Oh They were all theirs. was it? Yeah. Was that blue Escort there, the one that parked behind us? I've not seen him No, I was gonna say mm won't do him any harm getting a bit of a taste of his own medicine. Hmm I personally think he's seen the light about it. About time. We went and took Josh out didn't we? Give him a bit of a walk. You've been for a walk eh? Mm, we went in that, we went and got me barm cakes and a bit, a few veg and that, went, oh I bought Li Joanne a little set of er instead of an Easter egg, it's quite nice, I got it from that shop, you know erm next to Kingston and Hutch Oh yeah? er, what's it called er? Oh I call it the posh shop. Yeah, it's just like a select second shop in't it? Really, but er Yeah, but a hundred times dearer. but I mean some, yeah, but I mean the stuff is cheaper compared to what you pay to other shop What sort of it's nice it's just like, it's a sleeveless top, white, they had it in like lilac, jade and navy, erm and it's got, it's navy shorts with it Mm and like a big tie through the, the waist and the top is like white edge with navy and it's got like a sailor collar at the back oh lovely with like a navy stripe and erm an anchor on each side, it's quite nice cos intelligent people go along with it Ken? That's what gets my plate! Because they , because the intelligent people weren't involved! No I mean, I'm talking about the people who are not actually er, you know I i if concerned directly but give But their approval for these But they're people. they're not involved, the people the people that give their approval are the people that want it! And I mean er, and Yeah but I mean and also they, they get the masses on their side by the media! I know! The same as they're Exactly! doing now with the I mean what paper have you got? I know, well there you are! A Labour paper! This is what terrifies me! And what's, what's er what's your chance? The Mirror. Where's that ball gone? Yes. Bring that ball here! You got no bloody chance! But as I say, people believe everything, it's gospel! And you never hear the Labour party criticising. You know, but they should be criticised out of hand what's going on in this country but they bloody don't! Well when when if if the Labour party criticised and they do criticise Oh they criticise Ken, yeah. The only time that you will hear about it is whe , if you have the television on and you see it happening on the parliament and on your papers. Well you read your paper don't you? And we get a middle of the road one which is the Observer We we'll watch which is, they get some they do some pretty good But how often do the I mean, they they don't give you they don't give you every detail that's gone on all week! Oh no they're or there's certain ar they only pick a certain subject or Yes. whatever that's been thrashed. As you say , we'll see. Well he's gone on seven days of the week complaining about so and so we'll just narrow that down to one article about his his complaint that they may just make a little note he's complained seven times about this! So you see a little article That's right. he's not complaining! Yeah, but I mean basic things Ken, we'll take for example the low wages Yeah. we, we haven't got one now, they got one in Germany, they got one in France I in Yes. Italy. Well yes. Oh there we go, that was mistake number one George dear have you read the er holiday page at all? No not yet, er only about France, and I told you about Oh I'm not sure the Oh dear places you can go to Mm which is a fallacy I thought it was Barry there, he looked a bit like him. No he's trying to get up, get down naughty boy. E T get down, down. Down there, there's a good boy If you tell him sternly, he does understand the tone of your voice if he goes off and sulks for a while, well so be it you'll have to sulk till you get used to it, there you are. in the U K mm, yeah, all looks very nice, camping Joking aren't you camping? Well that's just what it looks like here you just eating al fresco and going back up to the chateau at a night Oh we're back in France again are we? Mm Yes well Oh I see, yeah, yes it's Mm It's not a cheap holiday by the time we get, get down there your petrol Well for us I mean it's and then the ferry across it's not so bad for somebody living on the south coast Yes but er, as you say erm, really it's such a long journey that you need a breather before you need to start to cross the channel Oh yes I think so a good thing you're inviting Ken didn't I to come with us? Yes I did mentioned it erm Did you to Ken? Well you were there weren't you too? I just mentioned it in passing and let the conversation carried on about something else so I, I don't know whether We didn't come into it Well, I mean we just said well that's, you know, an expensive place for a holiday by the sound of it, but erm we hadn't got into any details. Well this was erm Bulgaria Yes, yes Mm but er so I, I don't know if he'd be interested in. I certainly wouldn't coach it so I think you would be creased by the time you got there in two days. Yeah but of course if you were being serious you'd have to ask him directly wouldn't you? Oh yes, yeah, well I, I, I think we'd have to to begin with to er get something a bit more concrete, you know, about time, time Yeah cost and what not, and then you know when we've decided I mean I'm not particularly bothered whether comes along or not, but I just thought it might be nice to to give him a break away from home and he won't go on his Well I mean you're only doing it for him really aren't you, that's the idea was to help him Well this is it, he won't go on his own will he? But the only other thing perhaps he'll go with one of the kids, that's a possibility Yeah possibly but I don't think they, do, they don't, I mean they, they lived in Germany for a while haven't they, so, I don't think, oh no, didn't they go to Cyprus one year Pete and Colin or am I dreaming? Italy Did they? Yes Florentine or near Venice That was when he was posted in Germany wasn't it they went from there Yes that's right, yeah, but whether they I suppose to be in a position to What they got afford a holiday now, I mean now they've taken on a mortgage Yes that's a point so, you know that's a point, yeah so unless erm even if we tell us we went away for the weekend we could ask him along couldn't we? Well that's true, yes, yes, I mean that's the lakes, it's lovely up there isn't it? And it's only an hour or so away, so perhaps you should say that get a weekend in I wonder where there is a cheap place to where you can old furniture. Somewhere where you, where you can go, where you can offer to do the washing up for that afternoon if you get bored No I don't mean that I mean, I, we can find old shops that, are not fully conversant with the modern day prices of furniture Oh no all furniture you've got no chance mm. No I mean, what is he, different in there, operating in, especially in the what were the eastern country, erm standard of living is Oh there yes, no I meant in this country Not on par with ours is it? I don't think, I don't think there's anywhere left now, there might be somewhere but it'll be hard to find. Have you noticed all these holidays in Italy all Tuscany, you never see any A lot, yeah from southern Italy at all do you? Oh you see a lot of them from erm Oh I mean I know you can get the brochures, but in the papers there's paediatric coast don't you? farmhouse in Tuscany, rows and rows of them. You see them for Rome don't you? Not very often, not in here Is it tours? Not very often, not really Oh I mean the, the favoured place for the holiday makers is on er on the coast that was er Gisebelle and erm mm, what's the other one? Catonica Is it Rimini? Rimini, Catonica all on the coast, which is er the Black Polish isn't it? yeah mm there's a photograph that was in erm Karen's Radio Times, those two girls erm going on a diet. Oh yes the Erm the very big lady er, yes, yes, forty minutes on er B B C, have her stomach stapled Gosh Sounds drastic doesn't it? does it literally staple the stomach on the outside or does it Well it, according to what I read before, they say they staple the stomach down to the size of er, of a tea spoon, so presumably she, her stomach must only receive, she must of been eating twenty four hours a day, you know, to keep they, she didn't lose any weight, the other girl did, but er But I still like either that or, or the capacity re for your stomach expanding is, is er incredible because er, she still, you know she still doesn't lose weight I still like to know how they staple it. Yeah yes, I don't think you er you can measure I don't know, I mean if they staple it they close it off, er It must be an operation or Oh eh, just to staple have a another operation lost twelve stone, god it's like having, losing another person isn't it? Oh I see so it is a case of open you up and putting, inserting these staples must be Mm she was, what, what are you doing? Stop it sounds a bit drastic Said she, she's going in for her fourth operation presumably to have this stapling done again, she says I believe that she'd be far more counsellor, I, I would of thought she, she would of had counselling anyway before they go to stage of operating, surely, I mean, er don't they look in into sort of psychological aspects of it, it's usually a On the concept yep more than just physical reason I, I mean a lot of people are grossly overweight they, you know, people usually say oh it's the but now apparently in most cases it's very rare with that so it's gotta be too much eating and why do people over eat That's right it's usually too much eating or lack of exercise you know, I mean, there must be compensation for something mustn't there? Yes it's er I must record that Wildlife on One on er, tomorrow night, so I'm in Wales Oh yes Have you read any of your letters about the poems in last week's Observer? No They're not very flattering they didn't er, you weren't rated very highly I'm afraid I think er you tried to get away from the traditional type of Oh I see these one that they send in Mm Yes I er by the thousands I don't go a lot on them myself Oh poetry some of those poems that Bon had in her Touchstones book, especially the ones, the war, about the war, I read some of those and it made me cry, it was so sad. Oh the, the er the ones by erm what's name about the gas and that Oh to be honest I can't remember the Mm, very poignant Mm, but er anti war what was the one about the erm oh it was about the assembling of the gun Oh yes, oh do you remember that? And it's all about the parts naming oh naming the parts That's right yes and er Oh yes that one's come back to me that one now Mm horrible. There's a chap going on about the, the fake and the furniture of these two chairs Mm which are supposed to be erm Come here seventeenth century come here scallywag They said to this, the er, the shape of the stretchers going from side to side where you, where you can put your feet usually Mm you've got all this wear on them you see and the bow of these stretchers said that no one would a able to get their feet on and the guy that's faked it has done all this as he thought, authenticate it What, what they call it, stressing it don't they? Stressing it, yeah stressing it Mm and er it would of been impossible to rest your feet on the rail them performing the most uncomfortable contortionist, it says here oh Mm but did it look authentic with the thing, I mean not to the extent of Well I mean to the untrained eye with a , this guy was suspicious when he saw all this cracked varnish Yeah which it turned out to be wax Oh to simulate old varnish you see? Oh So then he started looking Yeah They've got a way of measuring wear on er stretchers Yeah I mean it's, it's so clever really isn't it how, how they do sort of er fake furniture like that. I mean to my mind you might just as well spend your money on, what are you doing idiot, on a well made piece of furniture today like some of those we've seen in, in beautifully made erm, I mean they're brand new but they will be antiques I suppose in the future you know for your, for your grandchildren sort of thing, but er I mean you can't possibly think what's things that are in there, it's astronomical. Mm, quite expensive as you say Mm, you silly dog, what are you doing, what are you doing, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, right, right, then, yeah, yeah, yeah, get him, right oh he said that heaven Mm yeah, you do huh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,Where's Muffin, behind the settee?

All the jobs you've been meaning to do Yeah, yeah Yes I know Hello there Good afternoon how's the family? Abnormal Yeah At one time we couldn't get Jessy to talk, he'd got a little girl with er and I noticed the little girl with her, yes. She waved as she came towards me and she said oh can't stop today Huh said I've got to get this one back for her mum or whatever said I'm in a hurry then I met some guy on the field, talking to him and er Who you don't know from Adam A spaniel which was off the lead, covered in mud a young one and of course these, this fellow went straight up to it E T Off the lead like? Off the lead and it was er, so boisterous up and down like this, well he didn't like it straight away he got the old aggro blade up his back about two inches wide then he was watching him like this then he ran Away from it or ran away from it you see and then when he came back he came to us and he growled a few times at it, so, but erm, backed off you know I said he he doesn't mean any harm I said but he's a bit nervous, hoping to god he didn't bite the, bite the other one Spaniel , yeah. he said in all that, we got two he said the other one cut itself badly this morning on er a piece of glass obvious he said managed to come back to me you know being on a lead all his leg was cut so he sort of been down to the vet and had two stitches Stitches so he said I've had to, they'd have to keep him in for ten days or more you know Mm stop him getting dirt keep going in it or whatever Yeah Yeah , erm, it's worth waiting to I saw Mr Bentley Mm. and er he hasn't got any stuff there of course No. but er, he said oh try the guy Try? the chap in Mold, whatever his name is Robert . I he said, he's an old type chemist he said just mention my name he said he perhaps fix you up with small quantities or try this other place in Wrexham he said they, chemist he said but they do wholesale work as well Mm. so, and then he was going on about the work he's doing on the Yes I thought he probably would. You were nearly at the end of the tape as well weren't you? I thought afterwards I bet that tape would run out when you're talking to and won't be able to turn it over. Mm, I don't think so but er he's had an awful struggle with that because he said Buckley's one of the worse places and no interest at all Nobody's interested no, it's a shame said er , they said Wrexham they've got two or three you know mu museums for, and that different halls he said er Well, there was talk about er getting the old hall down in the old street community centre, not the, the Yes What is it? What do they call it that hall? Hawkesbury hall Hawkesbury hall, yes by the school, yeah but I mean it's, it's still a sound building, I mean it could be Well it's been no, no, it's, it's condemned at the moment it's not safe. Is it? Oh yeah, you're not allowed to go in it Oh oh they've just locked but er locked it up because er he said they've er So did she say she could get some? Or Said she'll ask, said she knows she's got giving an errand to take out to the place you know because er if Well it's dangerous stuff to handle I suppose Mm but as you say wanted a tiny amount anyway so it's a joke isn't it? you know Mm several of us at college oh well she'll know by tomorrow night, you could her a call you would think tell me that much Which pub? at the college? well yes it's only a small amount for you, but er how many students are there? Well that's the thing yeah You multiple that by getting in a little bit however many there are There's about six I think Mm, even so I mean he, he's still got to buy it ain't he? Even so, yeah So er Oh they've probably got this much you know mm, I mean has he recommended that you use that he, he got or are you Oh I just taken it in out of the book? No that's what you've gotta, you, he showed us Oh said the stuff you're using is Rubbish old fashioned he says, it's got linseed oil in it he said, how'd you get it off? Mm You know that was the trouble you had with that table top, do you remember doing that polishing? And that, and this, you kept getting this er Oh no you, you can use this, but you oil through don't use that for polish you use a special oil, but he says don't even use that. Oh His brief seems to be, put as little french polish on as you can Mm put, and then wax you see, now this is what we haven't seen yet So just use wax to build up the polish waxing to, well not necessary to build it up, cos you, you've got this sealer on first you see Mm but you can that's what he does, but, if he want, I don't know, he have to Yeah sort of thing, so I have heard you say only three is that the number of posts they put in? That's already done innit? Well, cos with him being on night, I don't suppose he got up till about He started just after me, yeah one o'clock, yeah, there, and there were huge holes in the I mean you, you ask him if he'd erm arranged for a cement mixer and he said oh no he didn't want to bother, but I thought afterwards that'll be each one of those holes, he He says oh a ton what are we going to do with the yes or well that's right, in fact he might even need more sand he will but I bet one of those holes will take a whole wheelbarrow full of that Oh easily concrete and that's got to be one mix each time isn't it? Because what I used to do is throw the bricks in and concrete and water And water erm, no I mean apart from the concrete it helps to fill the hole Yes so if you just put the well the sand and gravel and the concrete as you say a barrow load goes nowhere Yeah I mean, huh, they never get blown over, but er, it's a lot of work isn't it? Where's little tiddly gone? Where is he by the way? Erm I said to you he's on the settee Hello, hello, hello if he's on there just shout at him will you because oh he's in here he's by the radiator aren't you beaut? He's a beauty babe, oh, rascal aren't you? Would give you that continuous conversation, erm where is, is life is it's surprising how much time you do have to put into it. I mean it surprised me I thought oh yes one and a half tapes a day, yeah, it's, it's a doddle, but erm, not, not only have you got to know how it functions, but you've got to know, know you've got to fill in your, your document Yeah to I mean ideally, ideally it'll be better to fill it in as you go along Personally I would of Well of course that's what vitamin C is isn't it? Well acetic acid is you know the chemical you know, it's got to be three third, er thirty three percent you see Oh which the vinegar's only about two percent probably that oh my god, well that's the stripper then really isn't it? You're only, you only Well you only put putting that much in Oh in this, in like a pint Mm, so you only want a small amount then really don't you? That's the trouble, I don't need a ruddy gallon Mm and the other of course is the eight eighty ammonia which is only half of five mil, two and a half mil teaspoon. Which chemist did you go to? Bob's Oh, and neither of them, no E T will you stop it you two, you see Aye get in your basket this minute I thought, I thought the other one had got it go on , go on. When you think of it, these chemists to date, no wonder their wives are on a low wage and the moaning all the time because they're not bloody chemists, they're just getting pills out of a box Yeah, that's right , yes, yeah you don't see erm doing this but, well after that, I mean and er, well years ago they had all these bottle of potions on the back shelf I suppose they were mixing up all the time, it's all antibiotics now and isn't it tablets or Mm bottles of already, ready mix There's a jar already done, you just pour it in Yeah, I suppose and mostly to erm, medicines are, are in tablet form aren't they? You know you don't get that many liquids it's usually for children isn't it? Ninety percent probably The erm you get The only liquid you get are probably cough medicines and stuff like that and Yeah which are all, er what they called? I bet they don't dispense much of that now because most people buy it over the counter don't they? Oh their own, yes I mean you're not going to spend three pound forty on a prescription if you can get a bottle for about one pound fifty so where you do it so well where you gonna go for that? Where else can you try? Er well I was gonna ask for when he comes, gonna ask or ask At the college do you mean? They seem to know about it, the ones who live in that area and the chemist Mm he's an old fashioned type Well why don't you try Mr Bentley I mean He's bloody finished now Well the shop's closed, but erm, he might be able to tell you somewhere nearer than to get it, I mean he's very obliging. He lives over the shop still doesn't he? Or at the back of the shop. He's a proper character isn't he? Mm But erm he might be able to er oblige you, he was certainly one of the last of the old breed of chemists I think a tissue in machine, bits dropping in and out Look in the pockets you great pi , oh I think there's probably one inside a pillow case knowing you Oh jesus, Maggots I caught a few there might be a fiver in one of them You've got no chance of that Hey did you know this Yes oh god Muffin you're not going out again you're covered in mud. I suppose they get fed up stuck in all the time, don't they? Yeah, and they're only out for a few minutes and they're fed up out there as well, and backwards and forwards like a fiddlers elbow go on I want to put those lupins in today, somewhere never mind, no, you're not having any more biscuits you Right I erm, I see it's ten past eleven, I want to get this ball washed, so, er, let them go in the wash Right I'm going to work in the workshop I'll tell you what, I get the erm, I get the battery of the, the other one, you can try it. You want to try it don't you if you're going to have it? Well this is it, it might be knackered now those two Has he been in the, in the loft in the workshop? Or No. Well you, it's not corroded or anything is it? Let's turn that down Can't turn it out. Power isn't it? Yes, but you won't get the same connections will you? I don't know Use your Fantastic that pause I'm looking for something somewhere Yes, well it appears to be working, but whether it's working correctly I don't know oh Ray, there is provision here for the headphones, you, you said are you supposed to use headphones with it, mind you it sounds pretty audible anyway, I don't think you need headphones, I mean I'm not sure there's a No See how she goes. Erm Thing is I've got to try by turning those volts down on some of them Yeah it's just that find out if there's any nails in the, in the wood. Possibly have stones You're not likely to get stones em embedded in the Oh I mean whether, whether that one is, is good enough for enough Mm, and it the nails in the wood that's all Oh yes it's, it's, how long ago was it when Robin bought that? Eleven or twelve wasn't he? Near that Say this er I think mm Have you actually got a plan drawn up with measurements, devised to the top and the base as well or are you going to do that when you I got the height of the base, you've seen that yes, yes Use that for the base obviously Muffin be quiet, what the devil's wrong with him? it's that much bigger so, you know just see how the top one goes and then I can copy that to the bottom Yeah, well you're going to do the base of it bigger aren't you? Yes Erm er the only, I'm not quite sure yet how the sides are going to and the door , the glass door he wanted it erm like the lead glass, oh similar to these Yes I know he wants it erm you know glazing bars Mm there's no way we could use it either of those, panels that were the glass panels that we've got in the garage, no, separate them, I mean it, they're not, they're not solid glass, they're two panes, which could be separated whether of ingenuity and What re-cut you mean? Well no not, not, well we could get them, I never thought of that Cut them they wouldn't be the exact size yes, ah that's a point now, I could take them down to erm, what's his name down the road and ask him, he's very obliging, ask him to cut them I don't know it depends er I was just thinking rather than having plain which you'd have to pay for anyway a plain piece of glass and, and er putting lead on it yourself I think that's a brilliant idea that. Well the idea is, is it's not so much the lead it suppose to be the bars, I don't know what they look like without old, old er it's a diamond , it's a diamond pattern isn't it for Yeah as opposed to the, but, but some cupboard doors are diamond pattern, Muffin will you be quiet have we any more bones cooked for them or have they had them all? No there's some there Cooked? oh that's what I mean, erm, well listen we'd better try and just, practice somehow and see erm what do you erm Are you gonna left that battery on well, well only temporarily, I only want this it's alright it's just this unit thing, when connected to right erm, just erm It just drops in there doesn't it, hanging oh I would of thought there was a rest for it surely, no? Do you think so? Just down the bottom Just down the bottom Right what you're going to have to do is erm Get a piece of wood with a nail in it Yeah, yeah I tell you what get a hold of that and put something underneath it. I don't know, it don't seem to react to that, that's a bit, mind you there again there's only going to be that there isn't it? Er, well, put it on the floor Go in your basket go on Yes, I cannot give it much more re-allocated, I might be able to get the two sides on, but I'll need more, obvious have some more wide bolts for the er top and the bottom So er, what you actually got to have it cut now, what have you? Those four Mm to that section of the oh these are about two inch are they or some, didn't say it wouldn't split in half went for it and Twelve inches across are they? That way They seemed quite wide to me when they were leaning against the wall. Wouldn't Sue do them? She hasn't got a hasn't she? I bet she had, I bet she had er no I know she's got a You really want one with a three I thought she had a band saw no I was gonna say you wobbling all over the place aren't you? And what about Duckman Peters wouldn't they do it for you? Er, mm, the other time I took stuff down there huge, to that their costs mm I'll have to pay mm you've got to pay for the teeth and the saw thirty pound a tooth Yeah, god worse than erm mm, how many have you got to now cut? and you mean to tell me with all that equipment the machine that they've got at the college, you couldn't get it done there? I haven't got anything that deep, the only goes to about five inches What can you do, can you do half at a time, can you No Why? at one time you could of done, but now, you've got to take the guards off To reverse them and turn it over Well I don't see how, all you've got to do is turn it upside down, you could still run it through the same way To make your first cut Yeah you have to take the guard off and the knife at the back of the saw, they, it is a bit dangerous, erm where's the guard goes at the top Mm just wouldn't go in would it, unless it's being stood right down Mm cut turn half way, the first cut, then turn it over with, you've got to have all the, just got a bit of the bare blade on the bench you see Yeah without a guard on it without a guard and they won't mm, mm allow that on this stand No I can understand that I suppose but there again it's only hand feed, you've, you got to have a, a machine that can feed on to take this tubing Something to grip it, mm We would have to like pull the wood through you see what about that erm, what about that other place that er timber place on the way to Kilkern erm we went there, you, oh you went in to ask about some walnut, do you remember when er Well er that's the same, that would be worth thinking this you know don't think you'd be very happy you know I mean you wouldn't wanna pay no be only worth a fiver to cut it, to them it's not worth Damaging them, saw, mm Well at least we've had a look at the whether we right OK, so we've eliminated all that have we? Well I mean What are you gonna do? I don't know It's impossible to do by hand No not impossible with a good saw Yeah and about ten irish navvies One down below and one above huh mm Try to get some er old door casings rip down from me you know, now, I was thinking of going to North Wales but I know what they'd say cos it, the ones that I got from our Rob's you know the they're quite clean but of course they've had nails in the, you know, the head like I made the cab some cabinets you know. I want them split down that road Which way? On the deep Oh on the deep two or three gorges Oh you want to fetch it down to a board technic That's so I can get two out of the one you know for the sides, erm, sides and Oh you want them to deep, deep, deep I don't think I'm gonna get that much joy myself, cos their reluctant aren't they to do anything that's not new. I thought there might be somewhere where they'd have an old circular saw you know, probably got a bit more chance with help, but they do a bit of rough cutting do you know what I mean? Yeah, but you won't get two out of it will you? But Well they're only for sides, you know, I'm, I'm doing them like er I the sides are coming out er like this you see those, those are already you know like that their fortunate with those I, I like them but, but I haven't got enough you see Yeah but er you won't get two that size will you? You reckon not, not with the cut, it's, well not that I know it's, it's got two it is a good er about one and five eighths Oh I say, yeah, you, well, you'll get one, you'll get a second one there, full one there Get a full one, get it doesn't matter really and I get one that width out of Yeah, yeah here you see and it'll all be joined up. It's, it's a band saw really that you want to put down Mm, they're not really safe Yeah, a band saw are you now are you? I got the old metal detected on, but, of course it could always be a bit of grit in it couldn't it Yeah or something like that. I know they don't like it No, er, no especially with a band saw, cos Oh hello Hello Margaret, well twenty years ago and, and, and they really had to and the whole band saw gotta to be resharpened he said and they go to a place in Most of them don't do their own now do they? No We used to have a shop you know, a saw doctor shop I when I had the time, did them all tension and set, you know, but erm, as you say now, they probably cost you about fifty pound a go every time they go away Yeah it's a I don't fancy doing by hand Well, even that little one of mine No I mean even with a hand saw, you know, I've done it before You had to wait, wait about twenty eight before you went on top I believe I don't know Yes, yes, oh yes and er all his brothers ev , every one of them went, they served their time and and er, it was er, the others were by having the lads and getting the trees down, er the extra wood that they got out of the er, out of the tree they lost so many with, with the thickness of the blade Oh I see, yes, yes, yeah, yeah that's right, yeah I think bloody hell, that must of been hard work that, they must of been at it all day Yeah, yeah How did they keep, how did they stop the flaming thing from snaking them all, you know? I don't know It must of had a good iron in it. Must of had terrific arms on them, oh dear me Yeah and I used to see them many a times in and what they'd leave them to what, then to, to dry wouldn't they at least? Oh I, yeah They'd take a long time to dry wouldn't they, then, on the sticks and that stacks of it and my father was in the woods before the war and they, he, he looked after the woods and cut the trees down and everything and then they were sent to Oh no, slowly, dried slowly you see Slowly to dry it was always as, as he went up to about a for pupation, yeah I'd like to seen how they did the, the ribbon book out of the heart Oh yes used to do a lot of drawer bottoms out of it yes must of had a knife or something to it, sliced wasn't it? Mind you I'm going, I've got a pub Nice to see there, there was a certain way of cutting the tree this is going back to get the figure into it I, a cut on the diagonal Yes you see, a diagonal, the raise so you've got a lovely figure in the, on the oak, Yeah but expensive that was yeah that's right cutting waste with it, as I say the ribbon stuff it must it, the georgian furniture you usually see that in Yeah this wide drawer bottoms you know, beautiful oak that's been sliced Yeah because that, presumably the heart was easier to cut, I don't know, very hard I wouldn't of thought so, it was I wouldn't of thought so the I'll have to find out of this where, where I found more so were that's the oldest part isn't it? That's the oldest part That's right on the knife and the er whether the grain was straighter, maybe that was the answer and the awkward thing was to hack a wood in the centre Yeah that's right, yeah, yeah An American oak is not too bad But the English you can end up doing a lot of scrapping for your finish Mm and it's just only because of the climate, there's er Cold weather, the, oh, is that what it was? That's right, yeah, he's, he's Mm, mm, funny there was a lad here this chap was here last week he bought this pine table up, got his key, and he'd been working for three years in Norway Oh yeah as a joiner Yeah and he was saying, told me some of the different names, you know, other than pine, I suppose their name for whatever these pines were, the timber there was beautiful Yeah the er all the knots, very few knots, just lovely yellow pine and er and they make all their furniture out of these pieces, so, he said that's what set me off on making furniture he said say that the cost of living there tremendous, tremendous ten years ago now they took out these tremendous mortgages because their wages had trebled, it, it about a ten year period, you know when the boom was on Yeah a few years ago, and he said er there was a lot of repossessions there. It's happening everywhere you see. You could buy a house very cheaply then, but er we, we didn't know what was going to happen that's not all you can do now is blame the Labour Party, it's incredible now. One of them said er when they start bringing the yes, yes that's right, lower lowering the taxes Everybody come here, this is the place to run a big business Yeah cheap labour Yeah you can fiddle all you want, get away with it, er I Well Nor you can't help me on this me old son Er it's a shame really, no he bought about erm I'm not even gonna volunteer to do about erm ten of these and then the head So apart from those three we said what else is there Ma No, well he's got a catalogue and we can send No, that, that catalogue he had I rang them and he sent me one Beeswax was it? Pure beeswax, what else? I bet that was a It was pure restoration materials Yes I've forgotten now I'm sure that's where he said he got it from the wax He said he got his waxes fifteen years ago and he's still using them Oh I think he gets all his stuff from that guy at, he got the brochure didn't he from somewhere up North? Yes, well Molly's just said she's rung them Well yeah, well I've got the brochure Oh I rang them up, it's, it's Bolton, but they don't do wax, they do all the other waxes Bury isn't it? Well I'd try Time and Bury the one? They caught , I don't, yeah actually the address I had Yes. Oh well I'll, I'll look, I'll ring I didn't actually ring I'll find out anyway them up and ask them and actually you know this Time Chemicals, they, they deliver you know, they come here with the stuff. Do they? Just ring them up, oh yeah, they go anywhere. What is the recipe I Bury ,, Bury Mm That's a good one isn't it, dear me, that's er Oh no, but, they, they will post it Post it, but then they're gonna charge aren't they?

He didn't do it No, no He, he had a lot of machinery actually years ago he, before he moved here he sold Oh Norm yes at his old place, he had er He sold er most of it three machines a great big saw and because he didn't have the room for it here and all this but er he had a business Well when he had it He's got a lot to do now you see when you've done it all, I suppose you could get a bit further with his yeah but he's got to the stage now as if yeah he's not gonna do a lot, whatever he did before at home I'm not sure but er he's done all his windows and stuff like that but I think then again he can do a lot at work you see.

Birmingham Polytechnic offer all their facilities absolutely free of charge to us so get yourself down in the entertainment bar in Aston. Er make full use of all their fields as well as their indoor gyms, leisure centre, swimming pool etcetera. Birmingham University don't let us use their stuff free of charge. Er it's thirty six pound a year to be a member there but if you are a keen sportsman their facilities are well worth using because it's a very very good sports centre indeed. Aston University haven't got an awful lot of good stuff in the way of indoor facilities. They've got a good seven a side outdoor astroturf pitch which we can hire fairly cheaply. But er I wouldn't recommend that too highly . Sporting teams, you all look a sporting bunch to me specially that chubby chap there in the middle er I've got contacts with not only all the local football, rugby, cricket clubs etcetera, but also the teams that sort of how do I put this represent people in er the city on, on a, a good sporting level, I E Mosely Rugby Club, Aston Villa Football Club, so whatever your standard is in any sport come and see me and I shall sort out exactly what you want. Of course the college has its own teams as well. Er football, rugby basketball are popular ones. Er any team that you do want to join, there is also a team available. If you actually want to set up the society yourself, find ten little friends, come along, ten people giving the number you need to form a society one pound each for membership, I shall give you all the er relevant data and you can start up your side in whatever it be as long as it doesn't contravene union policy on sexism, racism etcetera. And I'm sure you wouldn't. Er that's briefly enough on sport, I'm gonna move on to entertainment facilities now. The bar, the guild bar downstairs currently not open at the moment I grant you, but hopefully, with a bit of luck, tonight is the grand opening tonight. And what a wonderful place, what more can be said about the bar? Free with your guild card which you will carry with you everywhere I know, cheap beer, brilliant atmosphere, incredibly good DJs erm we're always looking for people to come along and have a go so if you wanna put your name down you can have a Saturday night and spin those wheels. excellent atmosphere, friendly barmen He's alright your friend there. He's just a bit grumpy, he's a bit grumpy at times, excellent barmen er I'm usually down there s sampling the, the Diet Coke or some such wondrous thing like that. Er and you will definitely get to know lots of people down there and it's a good focal point for the Guild. I must point out about isn't just the Guild a lot of people think it is but it is a good focal point to find out what's going on and meet people. Er on a slightly bigger scale entertainment again as we're only a small college, we do tend to liaise with the bigger education establishment in the city, I E Birmingham University, Central England University formerly Birmingham Polytechnic and Aston University. They have fairly regularly staged, what you might call bigger bands who play the university circuit as such and they're always, you know, dying for people to come along so there'll,th there'll be lists published at what time, what events are on at these places if you wanna go and do that and if you wanna go to the top notch bands, Birmingham's a good venue for that with the Leisure Centre, the M I A the N E C, the K G B etcetera etcetera all that stuff there so there's always plenty to do, don't, don't feel restricted just cos we're in er the middle of the city centre in this college and there doesn't seem a lot to do, there's a lot going on. A free legal service is offered by the Guild. It's a, a firm of city centre solicitors, they're very very good indeed er I recommend it thoroughly. It er doesn't have to be a problem related to college, any problem you've got er come and see me, it's as well to take advantage of it cos those of you who have been involved in legal wranglings before will it's quite an expensive business, so I mean you'll have to come and see me about that because it's fairly confidential so but they are very very good. Er what else can I go on about? Representation. Now there's a long word for you. Erm my job, I, I'm employed by the Union of Students which you have all paid your subscription to so therefore, in effect, you're all my bosses. I'm here to represent you basically as, as your voice with any problem you have, as I mentioned at the beginning. a problem is a, a lecture, a lecturer, other students, anything of the college er I'm the person who takes your voice. Now you're you're welcome to register a complaint yourself but I, I'm a representative on the Board of Governors, the Academic Board Committee etcetera etcetera so I can get these points right up where they belong. I can also, if I erm come across the same problem a few times I could hopefully work on that and then probably eradicate altogether. So do come and see me if it's a problem you've got that you think needs sorting out. Er again on the national level, if you think there's a, a campaign you wanna be involved in or wanna get started I'll put that on to the area N U S who will, if it's a credible case, will put it forward to the National Executive. But I'm really the person to come and see and I liaise with all these bodies as such. The annual general meeting our A G M is next week where, where we, we elect all the officers, the Guild officers, who will serve with me, and help me on the forthcoming year. There are eight positions up for grabs which are vice president, sports officer, entertainments officer publicity officer, welfare officer, women's officer and minorities and overseas officer. If you're interested in standing for any of those or wanna put someone forward to stand for one of those, come to the elections in room six two three, six two four Friday the twenty sixth at two fifteen twenty third, I'm sorry, at two fifteen and er not only will you get all the, the general info about what I've done so far this year, what I intend to do, what next year's budget's going to be etcetera, that's when those elections are actually held. So do come along to that. I'll leave it at the moment, I know you've now got a very busy day ahead of you lectures to attend and such things like that but er has anybody got a question or two they'd like to ask me concerning anything? Don't all rush at once. This man here. What's your question sir? Do the Guild offer a typing services? Not free of charge. There are, though, numerous students on certain of the third year and degree courses who are trying to earn a little extra income shall I put it and far from the majority of traditional methods they are to do it legally and set up little typewriting agencies etcetera and if you keep your eye on the notice boards you'll see various . For instance, you know, contact Carol H N D three F er for typing servi they're not free,th they're dirt cheap, about twenty P a page for A four. That's quite a bargain. Why, don't you like typing? No. rugby. No. Where can you play rugby? I shall, shall get in touch with Mosely Rugby Club for you. Thank you. It's taken me long enough god knows but I'll get in touch with them for oh dear I'll get in touch with them for you. round the corner no doubt I'm sure. Indeed. Any other questions ladies and gentlemen? Okey-dokey. . A boring society. we haven't got one of those. No I'm only joking. Erm thank you very indeed for your time boys, girls, ladies and gentleman.

Now, I've given you some cream to put on as well Anne. Right. Now, put that on three times a day and you put the tablets, you take the tablets four times a day. What the tablets for? It's an antibiotic stuff to clean it from the inside. Ah right. Because there's inflammation round about the inside of the pin It's that that's weep. and it's starting to come out, aye. It's starting to come out Mm. onto the skin. And trouble you. do you? Yes. Oh aye. I am. Oh aye. Mm. Oh aye. More or less. See Doctor , see my toes? I've seen them going kind of black, you know? Yes.

Right well. We'll get Right. that, we'll get that organized for you. Thanks Okay? very much. Right? Cheerio. Cheerio now. A letter to Mr at the surgeon at District Hospital. About Anne of . Dear Mr . You may have already saying that Mrs attended recently. She has a black and she asking about . turned septic. She's quite worried crusting and discharge but she's having . In fact been treatment with antibiotics and cream . However, she . I feel that she would Yes. Well I was born, born at in nineteen eleven. So it's quite a long while ago and I've travelled round quite a bit since then. My father was a Methodist minister. So we moved round every three or at the most four years, and er we we've been up in Scotland and er Yorkshire, Lancashire, and down East Anglia. And er it wasn't until he came up to a, er in the Skegness circuit when I was eighteen that's when I started nursing. And erm I ca I came to in the first place because it was the best teaching hospital in the Midlands at that time. And er it was near home as well so I, I should be able to get home for days off. That was the, the main thing. Oh was that, that was nice. Erm could you tell me about your father being a Methodist minister? He was, was he just moved on from time to time, or were they voluntary moves? No er in the Methodist er ci circuits they move them on, they're, they're invited for three years. Least they were at that time. And then at the end of the three years you were either invited to stay an, an extra year or s you were, you were sort of er you had an invitation from some other circuit. To go there. They used to send the stewards round and er you you'd suddenly see two new people in the congregation and they'd come to hear the minister preach to see if he was a good preacher and then they'd go back to report. A and then he would either have an official invitation or should hear no more about it . But that was very difficult from th the children's point of view. There were, there were two erm boarding schools for Methodist ministers' children. There was for boys and for girls. Er and you could go to a boarding school but if you didn't you were moved round every three or four years at the most to a different school. Er and my brother went to a boarding school but I didn't. And I've, it was always a big handicap because the syllabuses at different schools were different. You'd go to a school where they'd been doing French or Latin for two or three years and you hadn't done any at all. It was very very difficult. So I, I can't really say my school days were the happiest days, they certainly weren't. Mm. Was there any reason why your brother was sent to a boarding school but you weren't? Well not really. Boys in those days they were always given the best education. Girls it wasn't nearly so important that they should be er er an and also I, I don't think my parents thought I was really worth educating . They didn't think I was very bright or very brainy. I was a very er quiet child and er very little self confidence. I think that was a lot of it. And they didn't expect very much of me from my school reports and I thought, well if they didn't expect I you know I wasn't capable of it. And it wasn't really until I left school and er went into nursing that I thought, now this is something I'm starting on ev even with everybody else. Er and something I really wanted to do, and really enjoyed. Th that's where I, I really started in and sort of showed what I was made of. I could come out top in my exams then when I never did at school, I never did anything much at school at all. Do you think this was er special to your family that you were treated as you weren't a brainy one or do you think that was the way girls were generally treated? I, I think it was largely the way most girls were treated. Th you know it was just the sort of it, it all changed after the First World War and completely changed after the Second World War. Before then you, you were sort of, you were a girl. You stayed at home and helped in the home until you were old enough. Then you got married then and that was sort of the sum total of it. And it wasn't really until after the First World War when things really sort of er got started and er women sort of carried on and, and they do take jobs and occupations er that they sort of really came into their own. And certainly during the Second World War where they kept things going an and could prove that they were as good as any man . But even until ooh when, I, I can remember my daughter when she er was going to university. There were certain subjects that they said, keep off, because it doesn't matter how clever you are. It doesn't matter how good a degree you get. It will go for nothing. If a man applies and he, even if he hasn't got as good qualifications as y as you've got, you won't have a, stand an earthly. The man will always get the job. Well that has changed a lot now and I think it i it, it is a good thing as well. Do you think you were conscious as a child at the difference between the way your brother was treated and the way yourself? No. I think I just accepted it. He was younger than I was. Er he was a delicate baby and I was always the sturdy one and I was always expected to give in to him and sort of coddle him an an he, he, he was always sort of put first. I never minded at all. No. It didn't bother me. I think most people were the same in those days. Did you have to help around the house when you were a child? Not a great deal. We, we were expected, we did, we were expected to keep our own rooms tidy. And make our own beds but not, not a great deal. You see in those days i people i servants were so you could get servants so easily ev even if you didn't have somebody living in er you, you'd have a daily person. They saw to all the washing up. Er and that sort of thing. But no we weren't expected to do a lot in the house. Mm. So did you generally have a, a daily lady to come and help or Yes. We did. When we were about nine and ten and a half we had somebody living in because there were an awful lot of evening meetings that my father had to go to and usually mother went with him. Which meant we'd always got somebody in the house, sort of baby-sitting really. That, that's her main, she used to sort of look after things and baby-sit for us in the evenings. Ha have you got any particular memories of your earliest childhood? Not a great deal. I, I can remember we were at in Lancashire. That was during the First World War, I should be I suppose about five then. Er we er my father was chaplain to a big military hospital there. And it was always sort of open house and the nurses used to come in when they were off duty a lot. And oh the, the soldiers, the wounded soldiers, they used to come as well. You could always tell who they were. They had sort of er er rather pretty blue er suits they used to wear with white shirts and red ties. You could always tell they were, they were er they'd been wounded and, and they were i in hospital by their dress. And they used to come in a lot. An and I think of course we were made quite a fuss of too. Er and I, I don't know whether that was where I got my first idea of being a nurse. I never wanted to be anything else but a nurse. It was the one thing I always wanted to do. I never wanted to do anything, it never entered my head to do anything else. Er so whether I unconsciously got it from there, I, I don't really know, I may have done. Yes. Were there any other family infu influences at all in this line? I know on your wall here you, you have a lovely portrait of your grandfather and grandmother. Yes, yes. Th they influenced my life a, a lot. My mother died when I'd be about eleven. And er course summer holidays we always used to go and spend them with granny and granddad. They had retired and they lived down at Lowestoft so it was a lovely place to go for summer holidays. And we always used to go there. Er and they did, they influenced, they influenced er me a lot, a lot really and I suppose they did my brother as well. But er we, we could always ask granddad if we wanted to know anything. How babies were born or, or anything. We always go and ask granddad. And he'd never tell us, he, he'd never, he'd always tell us as much as he thought we could accept. He was very modern really for his age,fo for er the time he lived in really. Cos in those days they didn't. I mean it just wasn't talked about. You, you, you, you, girls used to get married in those days, and they were extremely innocent, they'd really no idea at all. And yo when I look back an and er and think of even when I first started nursing a lot of the girls we used to get in, they thought if they kissed a man they were going to have a baby. They were very innocent. But er things have changed a lot these days . Yes. What kind of job did your grandfather do? Ah he was a, he was a headmaster at a Methodist school at in Yorkshire. And er he'd worked his way up as a teacher, then he, he was a headmaster. And even then I, I would have sa thought he, he was very up to date. He used to have very definite ideas of, of er how to treat children. I don't know whether the psychiatrists would have agreed with him. But I know I could remember being taken round his school and in the main hall he'd got a glass fronted cupboard, and he'd got all sorts of well really and truly they were just pretty pebbles. I don't think they were anything much more than that. But they were all for certain things and I, I, I remember one er was for anybody who stuttered. And he'd got a boy who did stutter and he always used to go to granddad before er he when he came to school, before lessons and he'd give him this pebble and he'd say, now you can put it in your pocket. But always hold it, keep it and if you're holding that stone you won't stutter. And he didn't. And he got so he could gradually do without it and he never stuttered again. Most amazing thing . Did he Probably, you know, lack of self confidence or something like that. But it did the trick. Yes. Did he have other pebbles er which had other cures? Was this what the pebbles were for? He may have done. I really don't know, but I do remember that one. I remember him telling me about that, that stone. Mm. You said that your grandmother played quite a part in your upbringing after your mother died. Yes, yes. Well she taught me to knit and she taught me to do a lot of embroidery and that sort of thing. She did certainly influence me in, in that way. But erm I still do, I still do a lot of knitting. I can't do any embroidery nowadays but I do, I sti I'm never st er I've never er stopped enjoying knitting. It's always been a hobby with me. And then she did a lot of tatting. You don't hear that these days. Erm and we never knew how she did it, she never had told anybody how she did it, it died with her I'm afraid. But everything she, everything she did always had some embroidery on. She never did anything jus just plain. It was amazing really and even, she was eighty two when she died and even then she was knitting her own jumper suits. And embroidery. Even the canary cover had an embroidery on it. It was amazing . She'd ge nothing everything she did she had to sort of beautify it and put some embroidery on it. I, I take it that she didn't have a job as well. No. No. No. In those days women didn't seem to take part time jobs or jobs at all. I think if they did anything it, it was sort of charity work. Er and they did a lot of sewing for bazaars at church and that sort of thing. But er I don't really remember erm people going out to work much ex except, I suppose you'd call them the lower classes, or not really the working classes because er, but the lower classes they would take in washing. Er or they'd go out doi charring and go you know work the we used to have a woman come in once a week to do the washing. She'd come in and do the washing in the morning, and if it was a nice bright day she'd iron in the afternoon. For the whole family. Er and other er women would you know you'd take it to them an and they'd do it in, in their own homes. And it would come back already done. But other than that I don't think, women didn't do much I mean even in shops, the men were the shop assistants nearly always. So you didn't get women going out, nothing like, not like they do these days. And when you went to school, can you remember what wh that was like? Well I was never very happy at school. I never seemed to be sort of up to the other scholars at all. But er it was, the discipline was very much stricter than it is er today. Er nowadays so many things are just accepted that in those days they wouldn't be. I can remember one, one girl, I mean the great sin was to steal anything, and er they'd found in her, her satchel somebody else's pencil. Now whether it had got there by mistake we never knew but there was no question she was absolutely just dismissed on the spot. Sent home and that was it. But er any pinching or anything like that ooh it was erm it just wasn't accepted at all. It was a terrible crime. Whereas now I mean it's a case of if you lose anything it's your own fault for putting it down. It's, it's a terrible state of affairs really. It's not improved at all. And of course the discipline in the classroom er it was very strict. There was neve never any talking in class. I mean it was, you, you were sent out of the room. Did you as children think that that was fair? Oh yes we did. Yes, we went to school to learn and we were told not to talk. If we talked well we, we expected it. Er there wasn't anything like the, well not to the schools that I went to, the corporal punishment that there seems to have been since. Er it w I don't ever remember anyone you know getting the cane or anything like that. We did have lines, hundred lines, I must do not do this or something like that which was very negative really. Be far better if they told us to do something sensible . But er i it took your time up when you know when you might have been enjoying yourself. But, but erm no we expected, we accepted the, the discipline. We were told not to do a thing, if we did it well you, you knew what you were up against. Er I think far more than they do now. They don don't seem to take notice of what the teachers said. Er and I think perhaps teaching I don't know whether it's different today but they seemed to instil in us the love of, of poetry and the, the love of literature and that sort of thing. I've always been grateful for that, that they did you know create th th this love of poetry. I've never lost it. And I still like a lot of the, the classics an and the good, the good English. But er nowadays they sort of, I don't know, it's different. Did you have the variety of subjects that children have today? Er well I suppose we did but they were different. I er we, we had Latin and French mainly. Erm then we had all the usual maths and English, erm history and geography. Er I think we learnt it probably in different ways, we learnt it more parrot fashion than they do today. But I, I mean when it comes to times tables that sort of thing I've never been sorry I learnt those. I think a lot of schools do still teach the t the children their tables which I think is a good thing. You never forget them. But erm there was not the handicrafts. You, you were taught plain sewing and that sort of thing but that was about all. To hem and an and to seam. But erm n n not, not the handicrafts that they teach them now at school. I say I should think really and truly er schooling today is more fun than it was. We'd, it was very serious in our day but now it's much more fun. They enjoy it more. They do all sorts of erm projects that we never did. Er were the boys taught different things from the girls in some subjects? Yes. They, I mean carpentry, they had carpentry. Th th only boys did it and cookery only the girls that did it. Er you, you sort of got a basic idea of cookery. And, and of course needlework, but erm they were mainly the, I suppose they were giving you a good er grounding as they'd call it in those days. Mm. Er can you remember when you were a small child erm what sort of things you did at playtime at school? The kind of games you played? Well I suppose w we, yes we used to have erm hopscotch,th different seasons. I can't remember the seasons now, the different seasons brought out different games. There was hopscotch, er and then all of a sudden everybody would start with hoops. You couldn't do that these days, the traffic's too bad but we used to have wooden hoops or we'd have er iron hoops. Er and then skipping ropes, that was another thing. Er they, there were seasons for all these things and then erm balls, we used to used to play balls up against the walls. Er but er th th oh and tops, that were another thing. Yes, spinning tops. With whips. We used to, there used to be little wooden tops. And then we used to make crayon patterns of the top and then when they went whizzing round they used to look very pretty. And we used to see how who could keep them going the longest. And did both boys and girls play these games? They,everyb yes. Erm th tops. Girls mainly skipping, I don't remember ever seeing any boys skipping. The girls usually had the wooden hoops and the boys the iron hoops. Erm but other than that yes, they didn't,th they'd play more a sort of football, the boys would. We'd play just with ordinary er sort of tennis ball size, that type of ball. But other than that, yes we did more or less all play the same games. And we used to have long skipping ropes too. We used to be sort of er almost like a erm a clothes line. You used to go sort of right into the road, almost across the road, a side road. And you'd have two turning, one each end, and you'd get four, five, or even six people all skipping in the middle. At the same time. Yes. Can you tell me about your brother? What did your brother go on to do later? Er well he, he went, he, he went er he was erm for quite a while he was er he had Chow dogs. He was breeding Chow dogs and then he went t on to erm er he went to a poultry farm, for a time. And then when the war came he er he was one of the first Bevan boys that, one of the boys that went down the mines to relieve the miners. Er well that didn't last very long, he wasn't really cut out for that sort of thing at all. He, he, he was more of a scholastic type. Then he went in for er for teaching afterwards. Er and then he, he went to Singapore, he was there for quite a long while after the war teaching the er the English children. They didn't mix in those days. The English were taught in a different school to the Chinese. So he was teaching there and then he came back. Er he's retired now, but he was teaching in an English school for a while. Could you tell me about when he became a Bevan boy? Was that something he volunteered for? Well er I, well yes. They were sort of given a choice er i either I, I think it was sort of either you go on the land or er y you, you go down the mines. And he decided he'd try down the mines. But it was very hard work. I it, it was, it was alright f for people wh who were used to that sort of thing but I mean they hadn't all the mechanization in the mines then that they have now. It was really very hard work and he used to come back absolutely smothered in coal dust, very dirty. So I think he was down for about six months before he left. Where was that? Er do you know, I don't know. It'd be in one of the, the pits. I don't remember which one it was. He was married by that time and erm living down at but I don't think it, it would be fairly near there. It wouldn't be too far out. Can we turn now then to your own career? You'd decided to go into nursing, and you've said you'd always wanted Mm. Yes. to go into nursing. So how did you Mm. eventually start in nursing? Well i it, it certainly never entered my head to do anything else and although several other things were suggested er I never er I never even considered them. Er even the headmaster said, he tried to put me off. He said, oh you know it's very hard work. You have to clean a lot of brasses, but I mean I wasn't gonna be put off. And it was er it, it, when I, I was eighteen in the March. And I started at the General Hospital er in on May the first nineteen twenty nine. So Why why do you think people were trying to put you off? I don't think they thought I was cut out or suitable for nursing. I don't I don't know why they shouldn't . But whether they thought it was going to be too hard work, and, and it certainly was very hard work. But if you are doing something you, you like and want and enjoy doing er you, you don't mind working hard, at all. But it was very hard work. And of course it was very very poorly paid. We got er we, well after the first three months, the first three months we, we were s what they call student nurses. Er it was mainly lectures on erm hygiene, and biology,a and that type of thing. And er then we erm we, we, we went on the wards for about two or three hours a day and we just s sort of did what we were told, took out drinks and, and that sort of thing, and mouthwashes, and after er we'd been there for about six or eight weeks we were allowed to wash patients, if, if they couldn't wash themselves. Th this type of thing until the, after the three months we had to pass an exam. And if we passed the exam then we became er er p probationer nurses then. And started on the, on the wards. We started at seven in the morning and we finished at eight at night. And we had er two hours off during the day, er and twenty minutes for dinner and er about twenty minutes for tea. So we didn't get very much ti time off and by the time we got back to our rooms at night we were so terribly tired you just dropped into bed. I don't think I've ever been so tired before or since as I was just that, that first year when we were probationer nurses. We were on our feet the whole time. It, we never sort of slackened off at all and in those days there was so much brass to be cleaned and scrubbing to be done and cleaning. Everything was er so much more difficult than it, than it is today and er things were not sort of disposed of like they are now. They, they were all sterilized, thoroughly washed, and then st sterilized in, in the sterilizer, boiled in the sterilizer. And I and I don't know whether they still have the wooden lockers now but they used to be, have to be all scrubbed out every week. The outside polished. Er it, it was very hard work. There's no getting away from it. And when you were pros you did, you got all the mucky jobs to do as well. They always used to call us mucky little pros. And for all for er for that er you got, you, you well you got your keep er and I don't really think there was anything wrong with the food, it was the way it was cooked. It was terribly badly cooked. And you just could not manage on the food that was provided. You either got tuck boxes from home or you had to supplement it with your own earnings, which, ten shillings a week. We got two pounds a month. And out of that you had to keep yourself in stockings, er and shoes for the ward. Er and you, you, you provided yourself with the uniform before you came as a student nurse so that was alright for the first year, so you'd no uniform to provide. But er I often wonder what the nurses today would think if they if that's all they n they got . I know m money did go much farther in those days but there certainly wasn't very much to spare at all. Erm You kept so busy it seems a waste of time to ask you what your social life was like as a student nurse ? It was nil. Absolutely. There was never any time at all. And even when you got into your second years you did get erm two hours off one day and three hours the next, which was usually five till eight. But you had to be in by eight o'clock. So er I mean it wasn't much good if you wa wanted to go out with anybody. Say, well I'm awfully sorry I'm off at five but I got to be back at eight. It , no, no. It was absolutely, it wasn't, it was absolutely n no social life at all. If you were lucky er and you had friends in , you could go out for tea and, and that's about all there was. And on the Sunday well you'd go to church or chapel because literally there was nothing else to do. There was nothing going on in the centre of . It was absolutely dead. You couldn't get a cup of tea or a cup of coffee anywhere. Of course no theatres open, no pictures open, no coffee bars. Absolutely nothing. It was as dead as anything. Were all the student nurses about the same age? Yes. Yo occasionally you got somebody who was a little bit older but no we were nearly always, I don't think anyone much older could have stood the pace actually . Er we did have one person who was in her early twenties but er she gave it up. Er you know she couldn't stick it, she, she gave it up, it was too hard work. And do you think they all came from the same kind of background as yourself or were they more working people? . No, I think they were a real mixture. Er er they came from a good old cross section of life. I s I still even now occasionally see one or two that we, we all started together. We still keep up, we hear from one another at Christmas time. But erm no we there were, there were all sorts er there was, they used to come in of course from the country. Er there was a stationmaster's daughter there I remember. Erm no, no, we were a good old cross section I think really. In those days you know it, it was a vocation. You certainly didn't do it for the money . Er you, you did it because you really wanted to and it, it, it was a satisfying job. And that's what I think it, it's, I'm wondering now if the nurses today get the satisfaction from the job that we got in those early days. It was very hard work but you felt, well I've done a good day's work when you'd finished. Because when you were on night duty, which you, you did, er i it was a twelve hour stint right through from eight at night till eight in the morning. And course you, other than the half an hour for a meal in the middle of the night er that was it you got no time off at all. So erm Where do you think your satisfaction came from in the job? Well I suppose you i i i th th the patients were very very grateful for anything that you did. We did get them better a lot of them at any rate . Er and I think there w there was that satisfaction that you, you were doing something to help people get better. And they'd, they'd come in for surgery and you know you'd nurse them back again. Get them up on their feet. And there was a satisfaction about it although I always think in those days we had to work so fast that there wasn't the time to do what you'd really like to have done for the patients. It was a case of, I mean we used to start and wash them at three o'clock in the morning because t you had to start then because you'd never get it all done. You had to get everything done by the day staff coming on at seven. Er and if you didn't start at that early hour you'd, you'd, you'd never, they used to get, sit up in bed, have a wash,then lie down again and go to sleep . I mean I don't think they do, they do that these days, I hope not any rate . But you just had to do that sort of thing, I, we used to feel awfully sorry for the patients but you had, they had do it because they wouldn't have got a wash otherwise, there was so mu so much to do. I don't suppose the unions would put up with it these days but er ha there weren't such things as unions for nurses in those days. Was there nothing that even the full er fully trained nurses could join? No union? Well,i i just towards the end of my training there, there, there was the er College of Nursing started. Now er that really started to look into the, the, the nur the, the er profession and also to sort of see if they couldn't improve the lot of nurses. And of course now a large number of, of nurses, certainly the older ones do belong to the er College of Nursing, were members of that. We, I was in it, we, I think we paid a shilling a week, a five P a we er a, a five P a month to belong to it. Erm so we didn't pay very very much but they certainly had, they did, er they tried to standardize the, the nurses. Because e even in those days er it, it wasn't, there'd be good training hospitals and not so good. Now, nowadays a good training hospital will, will want at least er a number of O levels and preferably two or even three A levels before they would accept a student. Er standards have gone up, there's no doubt about that. But erm Did you have to have any particular qualifications when you started? They liked us to have what in those days was the matric. And if you had the matric yes well i it did help you to get in. Er you, you s a lot of them people did apply but er they just didn't you know they didn't get in. They didn't, what it was they didn't consider that people were suitable to become a nurse. I think that's what it was. But other than that, yeah they did like you to have your matric. I, I did have it and erm that was a help. The standard, standard of, of exams were pretty high, there's no getting away from that they were pretty high. Because you'd sort of, they, they'd go up and then if, if you went any farther you'd go on to the doctors' lectures you see. So they were pretty high in those days. Now it was the General Hospital in where you did your training. That's it, yes. Erm, can you remember what it was like generally in terms of facilities? Erm it wasn't too bad. We had our own bedrooms and that was saying quite a bit, because er the, the nurses home had been built er for the er as a sort of war memorial for after the First World War which was one of the most sensible war memorials I think anyone could have er provided . And we all had er our own bedrooms, which was nice. They weren't very big, but er they'd got a wardrobe, a be a single bed and er dressing table and drawers. Er and then we had about, ooh there'd be about ooh twenty of us to four bathrooms. And then we had er washrooms, about four or five washbasins in. Erm that, that, it, it wasn't too bad because people were coming on duty and going off duty. Er so I mean they were in use more or less all the time but er it was it wasn't, it wasn't too bad, better than a lot of hospitals had. Er ther there we did, we had a tutor sister who used to give us all our lectures. She did her best to try and in to make things a little bit more er interesting and she did start a tennis club up, which was nice because there was nothing at all before then. And we managed to get er two tennis courts which was very nice and we a we all used to play tennis. And she even managed to get us er somebody who would come and coach us a bit. So we, we th that, that was er another good thing they, they got going but there was very little for, for nurses to do. I think you were sort of there to, and then you see you, you've got to remember that all our lectures were taken in our off duty time. We didn't have time off for lectures we had to fit them in with our wi with our off duty. Er and often you'd come off duty at eight o'clock a and you'd have to go to a lecture between eight and nine at night. And, and even if you were on night duty you'd be on night duty for twelve hours, you'd come off at eight in the morning and have to go to a lecture at nine. And it was terribly difficult cos you'd just fall asleep. And many, and many a time tutor sister would rap on the desk and say, come on, wake up,we've nearly finished . She was very good. Very . But we used to have to take notes during the lecture a and then write the lectures up afterwards. So you could always borrow somebody else's notes to write them up . But nowadays of course they have a day off for lectures. Er it's much better really. But we did get terribly tired. And we had one day off a month. And if you were on night duty you'd get two nights off, but when you came back you'd, you'd, you'd have to be on duty that night so you'd have to go to bed that day. But we neve we never complained, no we, we, you know, we, we did, I suppose everybody worked harder in those days. I, I mean they did on the farms. I su I suppose erm things are easier now. And of course nowadays there's so much er things that er we use, there are so much labour saving things now that which makes a big difference. I think they've all got their own washing machines on the ward and that sort of thing, whereas we had to do it by hand and then bundle it all up and send it I I'll get some more. I see, yes! She does ask for some sometimes. She says can I have a tissue so And she hasn't got a box by her bed cos I bought her some the other day and she doesn't know. Right ! Okay. What's, what's the joke? You can hear a joke and see the funny side can't you? Only I asked her just now Yeah. said where's your tissues? Yeah. I don't know. And I just wondered are they by her bed that's all. Right ! Sorry, I've been laughing in the kitchen you see, that's what it is! That's alright. It's not No. you! No, alright Right, I've just gotta turn this off here. Only I just thought, you know, is she getting any then I'll Yeah. I think I'll bring, get some Yeah. more. I'll go and have a look now, okay? If you don't mind. Right. You alright Ivy? Eh?

I bet, I bet he's scared I walked down this ledge , walked down the stage and there's for security guards. You cannot walk past them if you're going in that way. So we had to go past this little shed which is right up right up this stupid grass earthy bank right over the side so we could see quickly how to get in. Went right round the bottom of this field, looked round the bank and there was just a bloody great hole in the gate massive! Walked through there and got to the simulator took our jackets off, pretended we'd already been in walked straight past and we were right on site! We wasn't aware it was there. Well I thought, saved us twenty quid! So all ? We were going , we were in! We're in! We're in! Pretty good! So all that row then was for absolutely nothing at all wasn't it really? Eh? All that And I used my old pass to go on stage anyhow so Have you got to pass for the stage then? Yeah. I used an What old one. So those but Fantasia passes are very similar, I just turned mine turned mine round she saw it and went she showed me a blank yellow so I didn't thought it perhaps a different pass but it wasn't just turned it round on her. I bet your friends a will be sick then, won't they? I just think that when you're up there it's like the stage is a huge platform going out into the crowd, a long one! And there must have been about ten thousand there last time. They had one of those gyroscopes you can go in and you can spin round. Oh yeah! They had one of those in there but I didn't have a go on it though, it was about three quid to go on! Those lasers lasers that the . Velcro walls? No, they didn't have that there. A huge octopus,octopus -ish, had these massive tentacles that's going right the way across the ceiling! Video screens. Very good! They're all gonna be pissed on Friday cos we got in for nothing!

He'll be more inclined to do it then won't he? Oh what , what inside in the Inside the letter that you're writing to him. I think that that would probably be quite a good idea wouldn't it, really? Yes? You must be exhausted? Why don't you go to sleep? this stuff haven't I? I've got things to do. I suppose we could just ignore it. It's a waste of a day isn't it, really? I'd rather be extremely tired. Saw Zac last night. What did erm, he say? That's why, I said I, I said I'd heard about you in the papers and the just said oh yeah! Was he embarrassed? No. Wouldn't you be? A bit, yeah. I'd be very embarrassed! See you've got that thing going whilst my voice is going. It's alright. I took it down to the Spar shop as well. Did you?

If they don't love me for what I am that's just tough shit! Yeah, but I mean if it, if it erm if it means that that it might spoil your entry into it, it's such a sa small thing isn't it? Really? Eh?

Don't know what to do about it, do you? What shall we do? Well to go I'll have se I'm not gonna not gonna ignore it, I'm gonna Where did you go last night then? Nowhere really. Nowhere! I was with a After that he went out! didn't go up there. Came home early didn't you? Up ah yeah. With Anne. With Anne? I felt terrible cos when he said he had one or two Did you? Yes. Who bought that? Me. What happened to that ? I think their heterosexual parents Mm. erm you know it's still er you know, considered problematic. Mm. Mm. version of most gay people come from heterosexual homes anyway, so Absolutely yeah and er you know kind of er it's absolutely impossible to, to determine exactly what it is that's, that's, you know, propelling people's sexuality isn't it? I, I mean You know, it's still I mean I yeah I included those because I thought a lot of pe even the sort of most Mm. right on people Yeah. are gonna have problems where children are concerned parenthood. Yes I think there's some, yeah yeah I, I think there's, that's one of the, the areas where er as it were attitudes are most small C conservative, that er sort of liberal heterosexuals whom I know er you know are often quite suspicious of that. Erm And I usually say well once, once, once gay and lesbian people start beating their kids like heterosexuals I'll, I'll agree with you but erm erm tt so er mm I mean I know that there, there were Mm. I mean I did read somewhere there were some studies done Mm. er on the American sort of er gay Mm. couples that have adopted Yeah. and the children were sort of actually more, you know, Mm. psychologically bal well balanced you know Yeah yeah mm. as, as they define it Yeah. than the sort of the, a controlled Well I think I think growing up with gay or lesbian parents I think, I think could be a very mind broadening experience for people it will certainly teach you about social life in a, in a lot of different ways that er Mm. people in heterosexual families wouldn't find out about erm and it teaches you ways of dealing with prejudice and discrimination, on the assumption that you, you, you do learn to deal with them, and er Mm. all sorts of stuff like that. Yeah erm oh well looks like we're nearly drifting towards the end, again as I, as I say I'm, I'm, I'm fairly, pretty happy with the questions erm you know er going back to what I was saying earlier I was just thinking that some of them might be more f easily phrased as non directional statements and you have the, you know, kind of have the words in the scales yeah right, good, so yeah Yeah I mean I'm definitely gonna put some words I think that erm as regards correlating things together and bunging them into the same factor analysis model and stuff like that er even if the questions are a bit different I think you can still do that legitimately because it's still sort of expressing the strength of opinion on some sort of scale erm so I don't see that that'll er interfere with the ambitions you've got as regards the data erm so er Mm. anyway I'm afraid I haven't sort of scribbled anything on that but you know kind of that's er No that's quite good enough, that's good. you know just, just thoughts I had as I was reading through it as best I can remember them so er mm But I mean this one I'm, I've got I, I would feel comfortable knowing that I, I was attracted to Yeah. so I put if I was attracted to my Er how, how or something like how would, how would you feel if you felt attracted to a member of your own sex or something yeah, yeah. Oh you'd you'd ask it in the form of a question? And you can bung, you can bung some bipolar adjectives underneath it of one sort or another er So I mean questions as opposed to statements. Er yeah, yeah, yeah erm Okay that's great. I know when, when invented scales back in the early thirties er typically they were declarative statements which people had to agree or disagree with erm but er I think perhaps more recently people have gone more for things that are a bit like how would you feel, what do you think type statements erm so er Mm. erm Yeah I think that'd break it up and I think The erm mm it'd be a bit boring with just the agree or disagree. Yeah, fair enough, so Right that's great. okay right so best of luck to you anyway if you okay sort of get that er sort of er get a, a neat copy run off we might be able to get it down for repro to reprographics in time for er Tuesday week with a bit of luck That should be no problem at all. Yeah good. Okay cheers, thanks a lot for your help. Okay? Cheers. Oh hello. Ah hello erm do come in. Yeah right oh well, now then now I'm afraid erm I'm doing a project for the British National Corpus which involves er trying to record everyday conversations so I've, I've got a microphone on, I hope you don't mind. Er Oh well never mind erm but, but, you know, informal consent and all that kind of thing so er right anyway erm so er how's it going? Well I've been told, well I I was gonna come and see you anyway Yeah. I'm a bit behind in my coursework and whatever Yeah. well, I'm a bit behind full stop. Yeah. So er Just to Mm. So what s what, well let let's get on to something a bit more s as it were specific, I mean what sort of things are you, are you behind with and having difficulty with then? Erm well I'm still on stuff from last term. Right. Yeah. Which Er well it's just I'm ha it's not that I'm having more difficulty with one thing than another, it's just that I haven't, I didn't get round to doing them. Yeah. Yeah erm is that gonna be a problem that's gonna recur in the future do you think? Or do you Erm do you think you'll be able to get sorted well to be honest Yeah. I find it quite difficult like Yeah. everything. Ah right. Yeah. Erm are there any specific areas of difficulty like you know sort of things like statistics, things like, you know, erm I dunno, other bits and pieces that er you know give you particular problems? Er subject itself Yeah erm I'd just don't know how to go with it, I dunno what to do. yeah erm I'm I'm alright on stats Yeah. It's what, what were you doing before you came here? Was it, was it like A levels or er Erm well I I'm a mature student Oh right. but I've had a few years out Yeah. but er er Yeah. you know. I think that's not uncommon actually if you, when you get people who've, who've been away from the education system for a f a few years and I think it's almost like mature students do have more anxiety than people who come straight from school generally speaking I think erm Mm. you know more likely to worry about work, more likely to feel that they're, they're not quite coping, more likely to feel erm you know that, that somehow everybody else is getting on with it and, and, and, and they can't, I mean that's just, you know, going from what people have told me so so it's more, it's more, oh right Yeah. but sometimes actually it's a more, you know, kind of it's, it's, it's not really because they've got problems but it's just because they, they're, they're, they're sort of more diligent and more, you know, more motivated but erm yeah getting on to What more motivated? Well in some cases, in some cases it is, I'm not saying every time but you know I mean sometimes it is erm so, I mean is there anything that you think, you know, we could change or you could change to, to like improve the situation? So, you know, is there anything, is it about the way you work, is it about the way the course is taught, is it about you know sort of reassurance and pastoral type stuff, is it about, you know, what? All of them I think but seriously All of them. Er mm it's that erm erm originally I couldn't get like the motivation Yeah. and I had trouble like er cos I come from like, I've got like science Mhm. and physics and all that sort of stuff I mean I Yeah, yeah. haven't written an essay for like a Yeah. I mean you're talking like I mean years, I mean really it's Mm. I can't remember the last essay I wrote Yeah. and I really have problems Yeah. with that sort of thing Mm. and er I just haven't it's like erm I just haven't put the time in Mm. I just haven't been able to motivate myself to put the time in Yeah. I've ch that's changing a bit now cos erm Mm. yeah I'm ge as I'm getting into the course like I've gotta realize that I've gotta do it but Yeah. er it's just not knowing where to go with it Mm. and er the stuff that I write is just rubbish, basically. Yeah. You know what I mean? Erm well I mean that's the you know one of, one of the things that er a lot of people contend with. I mean some people adopt the approach of trying to d do it all in about two hours just before the deadline so they don't have time to feel self critical erm I think perhaps if you can, you know, rather than, rather than trying to do it all at once I mean the business of, of going through successive drafts of things and gradually getting them better and better, I mean the first drafts of things that I write are, are usually just scribbles on the back of a piece of paper that's, with something else on the front Yeah. they're usually just notes, they're usually ill formed and not very well backed up and ill thought out and then gradually you know you sort of go through it again and you can fit more detail in Yeah. and gradually you can go through it again and sort of fit the references in and, you know, so gradually, and then, then you find it's too big and then you sort of go through it again and try and knock some stuff out so Yeah. I mean often actually producing pieces of writing is, is, is quite a, you know, sort of long drawn out sort of er iterative process I suppose in, in mathematical terms erm you know you kind of go through it again and again erm I mean that's one thing you ca but obviously that's quite time consuming er Yeah. so er erm and don't forget in the first year all you've got to do is pass Yeah erm it's just a qualifying year, yeah well everybody says that but you know it's worth bearing in mind that you've Yeah. just gotta put something in that in the coursework and the exams that sort of gets you over the forty percent barrier and in psychology it's not that difficult to sort of waffle your way up to forty percent erm without wishing ma to make it sound too easy erm it's not like my brother did in his physics degree where he sort of ended up getting twelve percent overall in his second year and then took the year again and got six percent erm that's very difficult to do in psychology erm so er mm but, you know, so er given that it's a sort of fairly discursive thing it's, it's, you know, it's probably, in some ways it's probably less difficult than you think. Erm yes Yeah but I mean I think the stuff, the stuff that I've written is like rubbish, it's like I dunno Yeah. it sounds like something you get on Mm. you know like television progra you know the really sort of Oh right, yeah. chatty type stuff? Mm. I just ca I just I've never done psychology before you see and so it's like erm Yeah, yeah. there's no, there's no er sources to it and I mean it's just like Yeah, mm. Yeah I know it's well again, you know, kind of once you can see, once you can see what's wrong with it rather than just sort of, you know, screwing it up and throwing it away, you know kind of if you can use that as a basis for, for, you know, kind of putting more of the stuff in that makes it look a bit more academic Yeah. erm you know kind of er call that a first draft and then sort , you know, sort of try and sort of go through the books again and stick a few references in to back up the points you've made so you can see it relates to other people's evidence erm trying to go through it again and knock out the well you know what I mean kind of statements and, and, you know, you can gradually sort of make the er grad you know sort of but again it's, it's, it's one of these processes that I find, you know, you need to go through again and again and again to sort of get it er get it together erm so erm What shall I do about the stuff that I haven't done? Erm well I'll if you could, if you could do me a list of, of what you've, what you've missed so far so we know where we are as it were erm what er mm I need two on Mm. I need two by the end of the term. Yeah whi which, which and which two I did the erm tt er what's it called? Erm Well there's that tutorial essay thing possibly Yeah I did that one Yeah and I did the erm the one about the information crisis. Whose tutor group where you in? Erm Mr . Oh right. Have you had that back yet or er No. No. Oh right well I'll erm er see er I'll, I'll see if I can catch Ian and, and, and see what, see what's happened to it It's bullshit. Oh right oh well, not to worry but mm yeah but you know I mean cos it was, it was bad actually I mean I actually kind of if you do, if you do manage to get some, some feedback on some of the stuff you've done so far it may turn out that it wasn't as bad as all that, you know Yeah. it may turn out that it hasn't failed miserably but, you know, there may be various ways in which you could improve it which you might, you know, if you're lucky he might have sort of written on, round the sides and round the edges and erm that's you know kind of one of the things that you can build on erm you know a lot of you know kind of build on, build on the criticism as it were and build on the things that people say could improve it erm Yeah. and er you know I think coming to a, a university is a thing that you know like it's a very sort of novel experience for a lot of people and you know certainly when I started the human psych course here, you know about twelve, thirteen years ago erm you know I didn't know what on earth was, was requ required and I agonized over work for quite, quite a long time and er Mm. you know it's not too uncommon but you know it's just a matter of I don't know what it is though it's kind of ge getting something in that er you know sort of satisfies the requirements of the course and most people gradually the hang of it, you know I think I will. What are you supposed to what are you supposed to do with things like erm you get ess you get lectures Mhm. okay and then erm it's, it's like like some lecturers give you like a set of notes Mm. Mhm. and some lecturers give you a set of references Yeah. so and you just end up with a list of names or something like that Mhm. and er are you supposed to go back and like research it yourself or Well erm in some ways I mean what we're doing in, in social say, most of that you can pick up out of the textbook where it's discussed in, in rather, slightly more detail and I stick in, you know, different kinds of examples and things like that to try and propel it along and make it a little bit different to the book erm with some of the other things, I mean for example if you erm get stuff off, I don't know, for example people like Ian erm Yeah. erm with him I mean he doesn't tend to give handouts but you know kind of if you write ever if you succeed in, in, in taking fairly good notes erm they're very often good enough to like survive on erm Yeah. er if it's people give you things like reference lists and reading lists, I mean sometimes that's the most confusing thing to be given because you don't know, I used to think you were supposed to read everything on them er and I actually tried doing that once or twice and I couldn't find stuff in Aston library so I ran up the er town library and went to Birmingham University library and then I got back the next week and I realized that I was about the only person who'd actually done that and other people hadn't Yeah. and erm you know it was erm er Too busy. yeah, absolutely, erm I think partly those things are to in when people pump out loads and loads of references, partly it's to indicate which studies the ideas, information, evidence have come from Yeah. so they're not just making it up out of their heads, it actually, you know, somebody really did a study on this, somebody really put this argument forward erm er partly it's to, I mean some of the things on those things you can't easily get in Aston library anyway, some of the things erm er particularly if they're references to general, you know, sort of, you know, general bits of the, you know, whatever textbook they seem to be using mostly erm Yeah. you know that's the sort of thing you might want to read as, as kind of background supplementary material and particularly I find it boring to Oh right erm but er well you can, you can get away without, without buying stuff erm I mean as I, as I say some people do end up sharing erm some people do end up, not that there's very much library stock very often but, you know, some people do I've noticed that I couldn't get any of the erm Mm. course books like I think, I can't afford to buy them then Yeah. er you have to use other books Yeah. Erm again you know with the subject matter, provided you can find stuff that does tend to cover the same sort of s topics erm it doesn't really the course is so like geared to like one textbook, you know Mm. most of the time Yeah. and I, I can't get hold of that textbook and then, and not knowing psychology before Mm. you end up with like all these books and they've got a different, different sort of er perspective on it and they've got Mm. Yeah. and they go into it in like different depths or Mhm. and, and you just end up with tt you don't, you can't follow it Yeah, yeah. and I, they do a bit and then another one, you have to go into another textbook Yeah. and er it's just like, I just lose it totally. Yeah. Mm. Yeah I, I suppose it is a tt it is a bit of a problem erm particularly for some of the stuff which you know it, it tends not to be dealt with very, very deeply in sort of general textbooks like some, you know, erm I think things like er some of the, you know some, some of the stuff that erm ah for example er people like Rob do erm Yeah. it's difficult to access that in general textbooks because it's often quite specialized Yeah erm some of the stuff that we end up doing in the second and final year you don't easily access through general textbooks because it's quite specialist Yeah. erm some of the stuff that you might be doing in things like perception and stuff like that erm Perce yeah perception yeah it might be, I don't know, I think usually Roy does that but I think Dave's doing it this year or something erm er that tends to be, that tended to be something that I had difficulty with as a student because again you couldn't just sort of find one book that, that covered the lecture course Yeah. erm You have to go to like ten different Yeah yeah and most of the good ones are gone and it's like the nineteen thirty Yeah. ones left in the library. Right yeah erm so that can be, that can be a bit awkward but still some of the older stuff can give you a bit of a grounding in, in, in, in, in, in what it's about if you can find anything relevant and sometimes you've just got to sort of wander round the library and pick things up off the shelves like at random and see, see if you can find something in the index or find something in the contents pages that sort of vaguely coincides with what the you know what's been talked about in the class that week erm sometimes if you keep looking you might actually be dead lucky and find one of the recommended books has actually come back in erm you may find that you've got to be a bit flexible about that because, you know, if a topic's dealt with in November you may not get a chance to see the book until you know kind of, I don't know, February or something, you know I mean so it, it sometimes does mean you've got to do the reading like a bit displaced from the from the classes Right. erm I know it, I know it, I know it's, yeah mm I, I know it's a, I know it's a problem with big, with big classes and, and, and few resources erm so er I've got few resources, I just can't afford to buy the books that's the Yeah, yeah that's the thing. so erm I'm just so behind I can't believe it, it's like Yeah. all of the first term went ah just like that Yeah. cos I was working as well that term. Mm. Are you, are you self funding or er Yeah oh right so it's like I'm working like yeah that makes it difficult as well God knows how many, although I'm not working any more I've lost the job but Yeah. I'm looking for another one but Yeah. so only like, I've had the last week off Mm. and I've er done an essay Mhm. but I can't afford to go on like that you see Yeah. and I don't know how I'm gonna survive Mm. I've got all the Yeah. other studying as well as the work to do. Yeah erm well that can, that can be difficult erm I know er when er when Dave did his psychology degree here erm he started out as an electrical engineer and he got interested Yeah. in psychology and chucked in electrical engineering and started a psychology course and he had to work at the same time as he studied for some of that time Yeah. and I don't know how he managed to fit it in er but some people manage it erm it means that sometimes you, you know, you're very time limited on, on, on writing things and you don't put in something that you feel does justice to yourself, you know, you put in what you think of as crap and, and you know mm I'm just not, I'm not bothering with coursework Mm. cos I mean there's loads of Mm. like everyone like you talk to someone and they're like throwing up all the technical information Mm. sort of jargon and you think well it's like cos er er they're Yeah. all starting to get into the Mm. sort of knowing what it's about now Yeah. even the people that didn't know before did the A level and that cos like a lot of A level Mm. but the people that like are new are starting to sort of oh, you know Yeah. oh that's the work of er Oh yeah they can say the say the, say the names and the dates and the, yeah, mm Yeah and I'm thinking well yeah. I'm gonna have to do some work on this and then erm Yeah. when it just comes down to it and I just don't know where to start Mm. it's like last term I didn't get anything and it was like Mm. I got very little notes and it's Mm. I just need like Yeah. you know is there somewhere that I can get the subjects that I need in, in each Yeah. lecture just like Well erm and all that? not, not very easily because there's different things apply to different courses like some things have got quite a lot of sort of documentation and handout materials some things Yeah. haven't erm er and erm you know some things you, you know there's the sort of one particular textbook that covers most of what we talk about in the classes, some things there isn't Yeah. erm so I mean for example with something like statistics that covers different techniques and activities from, you know, different books erm something like erm something like social most of it comes out of that which is a thing we did because people were experiencing difficulty with it so we thought well right we'll, we'll, we'll sort of anchor the syllabus mostly to, you know, one particular book erm so different, different staff use different techniques, some people ha have drawn on a whole variety of things and, and, and some people have just drawn on one erm I think the main priority is to try and do some coursework though in your case erm You reckon? Yeah, if there's still stuff outstanding just so you erm Well there's only one Mm. I've done one Mm. but it's like er it's the one for Guy about memories and Oh right, yeah. it's a bit erm it's awful but erm Mm. I dunno whether, should I go and see him or hand it in or what? Well I'll tell you what if you want to yeah, if you, if you want, well do, do have a word with him if you possible can erm Yeah. er I think, I know he's not around very much at the moment because he's supposed to be on sabbatical but, you know, erm do Oh yeah. do, do let him know er because if we if we sort of know you know if, if, if a, if an essay just comes in off somebody we've never met or something like that Yeah. and it comes in late we're, we, it doesn't it ins it doesn't make us very sympathetic but you know if, if, if, if people know who you are and, you know, you know they know you've ha they've had a conversation with you then it, it makes it easier Mm. erm you know even if it does come in late so we can say oh yes I remember this person sort of thing, you know stuff like that. How about, how about coursework which isn't actually due in yet like stuff for the end of this term or the beginning of next, I mean do you reckon you'll be able to have a, have a stab at that some time? I haven't started I haven't started Yeah. Yeah I'll give that try but I've got this other Yeah. this practical for Dave in from last term Right. that's that's like Yeah well that is. as I say if you could erm if you could some time soon drop a note off in my tray about, you know, kind of what exactly you've got outstanding so I can go round and see the erm see the people concerned and, and say that you've been to just the one thing Well mm well you, you can but it'll be nice to, it will be nice to have something, something, you know, kind of some sort of list we can, we can refer to and, and say oh yes oh great he's handed that one in now and, and sort of knock it off because I know they do keep records in the office but, you know just, just something so, so we know where you are erm and it also kind of er will perhaps help concentrate the mind on what you need to get done erm so er I know there's a and there's also practical is, is Mm. I'm just Yeah now that's, that's probably worth mentioning to Dave because I think one of the things he was talking about doing was instead of one of the tests or something making people hand in either some sort of lab book or some sort of record of the practical so far this term erm Yeah I hate practicals. Yeah. So erm that's, if you're, if you're getting behind on that it's worth trying to do something about it soonish before you get too far behind to manage to catch up Yeah. erm because that's like a continuous thing erm with with some other stuff, if it's just like essays or projects due in at the end of this term or beginning of next, you know get, get the light stuff out of the way first erm and try you may find it easier if you, if you, what I used to do was sort of try and, you know, pace it out a little bit and not try and write an essay all at once because I found that very difficult to do but if you just sort of write a paragraph and do, do something else for a bit and you know kind of write another paragraph a bit later on in the day and, and, you know, kind of erm you know work, you know don't, don't try and write an essay all in one evening but try and sort of, you know, if you've managed to spread it out over the course of a few days so that you don't have to do too much at once I mean it's difficult to concentrate on one thing just so behind on the coursework Mm. Yeah. and take the notes and that Mm. cos erm I just need to do some work on that, I've still got last term's work and everything, I just Yeah. you know what I mean? Well it is possible, it is possible because erm you know we're not necessarily dealing with anything that's horrendously difficult this year erm Yeah. I think usually most people find the second year more intensive, there's more work to do Yeah. and the final year I think there's sort of less on the timetable but people tend to do more work for it and do a project as well but in the, in the first year erm you know it's not that difficult to, to pass it erm er and there are always the, the, the referred papers in September so if you're, if you're keen to well you know if, I mean if you're keen to keep on the course but just having a few difficulties Yeah then you know it's probably it's probably possible possible yeah but erm you know I mean some people do actually get total, totally pissed off with the university and the course and everything and, and decide to chuck it in, you know, er in which case I've done that before though. Mm. Oh right. Where did you, where did you, where were you before? Erm I was at Manchester doing physics. Oh right, mm. And I couldn't stand physics, I just sort of Yeah I think that's what happened to my brother actually. Yeah can happen. Yeah. So Mm. So I can't really er but I like this course as well, Mm yeah oh well if you find, you know, there's anything you like about it or anything interesting in it that does help because it, you know, it certainly makes it a lot easier to learn things, take information in, revise things erm whatever. I do think it's interesting but I just er Mm. it's like say, say I, say I fin say I go from here now and I Mm. Mm. I think and I think well I've got this one practical to do and I've got erm Yeah. Yeah. which I can get done and then I've got Mm. all this coursework that I, all this er lecture stuff that I'm behind on, lots of it Yeah. and I don't really know where to start Yeah. to be honest I don't Yeah erm tt well if I was you I'd probably try and, and keep up to date with the stuff that's happening now Yeah. and then gradually try and re don't, don't spend too much time trying to reconstruct the past because that, you know, you just get further and further behind with the present stuff so you know kind of try and at least make sure that, you know, maybe if you get a job you won't be able to go to all the classes but at least make sure you, you are in contact with somebody who has that you can get notes off every time, you know, that erm oh hello Hi can I come to hello can you to see you later? Erm how much later? Are you very busy? Well Erm let's see er whenever you're free er let's see, it will be this afternoon some time, erm Yeah that's fine. if you could try me about sort of some time between three and four Okay. I should think because I'm doing something with some students shortly and then erm there's somebody coming to see me at two so er Right I'll come up then. Thanks. Okay right. So yeah erm so erm tt er yeah so oh that reminds me I think I may have left something in the lecture theatre I was in this morning, oh my God it was a letter from somebody yes I have, oh shit! Oh dear. Erm do you mind if I leave you for a second? I'll just nip back and see if I can get the thing. Erm Oh excuse me. people right thank you Hello. Hello. Phew, just had to burst into somebody else's class and get my er thing back. Right, yeah so erm you know I mean that's probably the best thing to do if you try and, try and at least keep up to date with the rest of this term and er you know not er make sure, even if you haven't been to a class at least you know what went, went on there from somebody Yeah. erm so er Right. yeah I think that's probably the best thing and gradually the past you've missed might start fitting into place as it were you know if you, if you keep up with the present, I think that's probably the best thing so er and, you know, er I know it's no comfort but these things take time, you know it takes time to get socialized into something and it takes time to get used to a way of working. Yeah well I mean most people do, I mean Yeah I think I mean I will but yeah, so er so I've gotta go and see someone else, who else should I see about this? Well er if I was you if you're, if you're missing out on stuff from, from Guy try and see Guy, if you're missing out on stuff from Dave try and see Dave Yeah. erm if erm have you seen, seen Ian since those tutorials at all? No. Well you might want to go and ask him er about it because he'll be presumably your, your, your personal tutor as well so erm you may be able to get some more er you know, some, some, something off him you know kind of what he thought of your essay or something like that Yeah. because I haven't seen any of your written work so I can't really sort of erm er dispense any advice yet er Okay. so erm er or indeed it may be if, if you ask him or if you ask in the general office it may of erm tt it may have it may have been marked by now and so er Could be. you know er Right. but er anyway as I say see, see, see the people who, whose work you're late with so er So where can I find Guy then? Guy lives on the sixth floor in let me see, it's on the it's if, if you're going along the corridor it's just past the final year notice boards, it does have a number, I've forgotten which one it is but it's on the right hand side. Dave is further down the sixth floor corridor, it's almost directly under this room Aha. and it's er the end on the left hand side if you go in there's like a little sort of little sort of lobby and, and Dave's is the little room sort of straight ahead of you, it's about down there somewhere Yeah. as the, as the woodworm crawls I suppose erm so erm yeah so, so you know kind of get in touch with the people whose work you've missed and, and er, you know, er so at least they, when it, you know, when it does arrive they'll know what the circumstances are so er Do you actually fail the year if you don't hand in a piece of work? Erm let's see, usually what happens is there's an exam board in June after people have hopefully done all their coursework and, and done their exams and then we decide what to do with the people er you know who've failed something or there's stuff missing Mm. erm usually if it's just one or two things people are offered the opportunity to submit a piece of work over the summer Aha. if it's just like one exam or two exams that they've failed or they've been ill for or they've missed or something they're offered the opportunity to sit those in September then we have another exam board in September Yeah. and see what the situation is then. Usually most of the people who've had coursework and exams to do over the1561 Yeah erm then er then, then what do we do? Erm then we wonder whether to offer people the chance of, you know, offer them a resit year or whether we want to ask them to withdraw asking people to withdraw is very rare actually, I haven't seen that done very often Oh God. so er usually people, people do, people do leave but it's usually because they, they, they're they're sick of it or you know they, they want Oh right. to do something else elsewhere or they want to transfer to transport management or something like that as people do sometimes That's an idea. Yeah. Er yeah and I think people in the first term are quite attracted to it because it doesn't seem to have much on the timetable erm What transport management? transport management, yeah, erm anyway erm so well if you, if you can well if you can give me a list of, of what's outstanding, if you can see Dave and you can see Guy Yeah. er for the time being and if you ask Dave about this thing you've missed and also about what this business about erm cos he has explained it to me but I'm not quite sure about it, this business of keeping a, a sort of l record of all the practicals for this term Yeah. cos if you've missed the first couple of weeks' worth or so erm You only have to do eight out of ten. Oh eight out of ten, so there's still, there's still time to er still time to redeem yourself, good Yeah that's no problem. Okay. Oh well you already know about that in that case erm I know what I've gotta do but it's just doing it Yeah, yeah, yeah so er erm when do you want, where do you want me to put this list then? Er well if you look in the general office erm just in on the sixth floor yeah erm it's, there's a load of plastic trays erm Right. for leaving messages for staff and stuff like that, mine's the Will you know who I am? er mine's the top one it says erm well I'll, I'll reme I'll rem I'll, yeah, well it just says on it and it's the, it's the top one on the left hand side as you're facing them Okay. it's the one nearest the door So what you just want my name and Your, your name and what you're missing, yeah. Alright no problem. So er so we can er we can see where we are as it were Alright then Right okay well mm, yeah Jenny's, Jenny's quite good about that sort of thing, she seems to be er be quite on the ball about who's handed in what erm Yeah she does yeah but er yeah there, there's a gre there's a great er it's a great shame actually erm we may not have Jenny for very much longer, they may not renew her contract which will be a big shame. Have to get a petition up or something. Yeah erm I dunno if it would do much good actually but er yeah but er no she, she's, she's quite good about you know sort of erm you know kind of keeping an eye on students and, and stuff like that, anyway er so if you could right see you see you again Er right see you soon then. Bye. Hello tape recorder, you seemed to go off there for a while, I'm just checking that you're still working again, thanks very much. So that's why I'm going around with a little machine and a microphone on and they're trying to get some record of, of what It's best to explain it you know. yeah sort of Eng er how English is spoken sort of around er in different, you know, circumstances in private places and universities and television and all sorts of things like that. A lot of things and don't knows Yeah. with me so Mm. Right. Yeah. Okay? What it was it's from this book really Mhm. which was this study Mm. here which I've read about, it's got erm articles about the blind, dreams of the blind Oh yeah? now what, what it actually was was er some a systematic set of questions about the natural experience of people prone to auditory and visual images, number of people in Yeah. now I've looked it up, that's supposed to actually be in our library Yeah. but it's not now I've Mhm. left a note for a while now them Is, mm to try and locate it but er what er It's the is it a book or a journal? no it's a journal, it's the Erm erm disease, mental disease or something well is it er there's a thing about general nervous and mental dis general nervous and mental disease, that's the one, yeah. Yeah Oh right. It's one of seventy which is supposedly the first one they've got Mm. there but Oh right erm well often the coverage, even when they think they've got it, is not terribly good Mm. erm for some reason certain issues don't seem to have appeared in the first place No. or if they have people have nicked them and, and Right. all sorts of other things. Yeah. It's er it's not that obscure er have you checked Birmingham University library or anything like that? It might be worth a, a bit of bus riding around I haven't yet no, no cos, yeah I was and you might be able to get it erm me and Gareth wanna go over there and you know I'll Oh yes, yes. and he wants to get it for his disability project to see if he can get Oh right so, mhm you know I think we're gonna take a trip over anyway so Yeah, yeah excellent, good, so you might be able to find some more stuff. Right erm questionnaire, I've got in contact with the Institute again Yeah? erm with these people Mhm. erm she said she thought everything would be okay apart from partial blind due to accident after teenage years cos it's basically it's actually a college Mhm. which she said they do have people who don't progress much staying on Yeah. but on the whole it's like Yeah. you know sixteen to mostly Yeah. sixteen to twenty one year olds Mhm. so erm So er see talk I'm talking about twenty five okay so it, yeah it looks like quite a reasonable number of people possibly Yeah. yeah? Good. Yeah. Oh and she's just said you know get 'em a questionnaire done, that was really what was Yeah yeah fine. you know wanted to get with you really. Yes erm Erm right yeah this was just asking myself really and for you Mhm. erm right in the book and other ones I've read, cos I've also got, well I've got quite a few journals with Yeah, yeah, good. with the various ones so erm some of them done like open ended, see what I was wondering was, where, I wrote this organized here Yeah. Yeah it was analyzing it erm whether I wanted to do general questions on general dreams that A Mm. tell me how their dreams are formed Yeah. or which is one which they've done in there, is take a specific dream which they've had which is vivid to them Mhm. and describe with all feelings and everything Yeah and trying to Mm. as opposed to as prompting questions to ask Yeah. about analysis or me giving them the dream and I have to sort of like get out for myself what Yeah. how they do it. Well I mean you could do a bit of both, I don't see why you can't sort of start out with some general stuff about whether That's what, that's what I was thinking, that's what I was thinking of doing, yeah. they actually experience dreams at all Yeah. you know because some people claim not to, blind and sighted, er you know and then, then maybe you can sort of say well, you know, what sort of things do you see, what sort of things do you feel and then get on to something specific Mm. you know, can you think of one you might've had last night or one that you particularly remember or something like that Yeah. They've had some and try and incredible dreams oh right so you actually er mm. it's really funny, yeah I, I went over there erm it was really to meet the woman but I ended up erm she said do you wanna spend the afternoon with them Yeah. so they had like an hour break so I spent in a room . See the trouble, the trouble which I found was it was difficult trying, you know, it's not about dream con you know it's not about Mm. dream meaning and Yeah. they were sort of like you know interested in what I you know you see what I mean? It was difficult Oh yeah, so yeah, absolutely yes there's that er whenever anything's to do with dreaming Yeah. there's that suspicion that you're trying to Yeah. er access what their personality's all about, you know they, mm There's, there's, there's one one bloke had a erm speaking, a dog which spoke to them which gave them the Oh yeah? for the next day Mm. races oh I mean you know Yeah . they're, they're quite Yeah. erm Were the dog's tips any good or er did it turn out He said he could never remember them Oh right. he says he can never remember the names, it's the times that er Mm. Yeah er he's not a millionaire yet. No so perhaps not, mm. Oh perhaps, perhaps he, perhaps he has the knowledge but has difficulty in er navigating his way to the betting shop to to do anything about it. Anyway erm Right I've results see this is Mm. this is really what I'm Yeah. comparison of subjects within groups and between groups I thought that's Yeah, mm. like a typical analysis variance Well yeah it cer it certainly But it certainly can be. Erm it depends on erm it depends on what you ask them though er if you get erm excuse me if you get er I'm just trying not to ripple the fabric just yet erm sorry that's going on the tape recorder isn't it? Never mind. erm if you it depends on what you do I mean if you're generating quantitative material, you know, if you get some sort of scale ratings of things like sort of estimates of how, how frequently they dream That's exactly why I wanted that because they've done estimates of erm yeah so they've actually got a, a standard questionnaire in this paper that you can't find yet? Mm. Mm. Right good. Erm you know all feelings of how vivid they are on average or feelings about how you know any,anyth anything you can write a question about that, that you can put on a scale of some sort Yeah. that you can try and get them to say well is that sort of moderately vivid or very vivid or very very vivid or absolutely compelling just like real life or erm I, I don't know what, what, what you'd be able to do erm it's obviously gotta be something that you can present orally Yeah. er but erm that kind of thing where you can sort of scale the responses in some way or say how many times a week or say how many times in the last year or how many times since Christmas or something erm fine yeah you can do, you can do stats on that, you can hopefully find P less than point O five etcetera etcetera between the different groups Mm. you can also erm maybe try and correlate things like, oh I don't know, how frequently they came, claim to dream with how much they rate their enjoyment of dreams on average or, you know, all these kinds of things are possible Mm. erm equally if you can't get any significant differences between the five different groups of five people you can try and split the stuff up, once you've got the data you can try and split it up in other ways, divide them into two groups and see Yeah. if you know there are any other kinds of differences. Mm. with,wi is Yeah sorry yeah. obviously with the questionnaire I'm going, I wanna get, like you said, a lot of results where I can split them up, you know Yeah. it's really getting the questionnaire in a good format that's what Yeah, mm. I'm worried about cos basically it leads on I know Yeah. you know talking to five, you know, people who've done their projects, they've said some of the trouble going out Yeah. you know was that they'd got results which they couldn't sort of like apply Mm. so I'm trying to do it Yeah. you know, look at the results and to effectively try and to sort of like estimate them. Yeah, yeah. Mm yeah. The poor old printer seems to have broken, it won't, it won't it won't make the paper lie down flat when er when it's finished. Yeah that's just an updated list of, of project people because some people have changed their titles and, and some people have There's some interesting titles isn't there? Yeah. I'm really, I was really impressed Mm. So erm yeah so I don't know in, in, in some ways what the questionnaire actually ends up looking like is, is, is up to you, I mean you've already spoken to some of these people and spoken to some of the organizations involved Yeah. and, and stuff like that so I mean in a sense you're by now a fairly good judge of the way to go about this sort of thing, you're a fairly good judge of what sort of things are important, perhaps the way in which people describe stuff and, and, you know, words, concepts, vocabularies erm all that kind of thing which obviously it helps if your questionnaire fits in with Yeah. erm so erm I don't know it's just down to generating some questions. Mm. I mean you may want to er for example, you know in some ways some of the responses may fit in quite nicely as a point on a scale or something like that, you may have some, you know, be able to in fact I advise you to come up with a fair number of quantitative type questions Right. where you, you get a scale response to them and we can do stats on but equally, if you get people to describe their most recent dream or describe their most erm, you know, compelling dream or, you know, a good one that they've had in the last year or something like that, you may want to try and get that on tape or something like that erm if possible, yeah. Yeah I was wondering about using tape actually. I'm afraid I, I've only got one spare tape recorder and I've lent it to somebody already erm Yeah yeah so mm I've got one erm so er it's sometimes possible to borrow from the university but they usually, they usually make it very difficult for one so er oh thanks, erm so erm anyway because with a thing like people's accounts of dreams you may want to sort of go back and look at them, you know, sort of how people have expressed them in their own words, they may have er you know produced some nice interesting quotes or something like that Mm. you know to er Yeah. er you know express the dream in or express their feelings about it. Well it's very, it's really interesting actually I had Yeah mm. a brilliant afternoon, it was Yeah, good. it was really exciting. Yeah Erm so er other things to right Mm. I've got, in the introduction Mm. er do you think it should be in the form of like a erm you know abstract introduction method er yeah Yeah I think that's usually the safest thing to go for with these things Right. however you've done the inve investigation, it looks like you've already spotted some literature of various kinds Mhm. articles, books and stuff like that which talk about this thing erm it helps obviously if you can link in what you're asking people to some of these previous ideas, theories, bits of evidence and stuff like that Mm. so it looks like, when you write it up it looks like some, it's got some sort of continuous argument to it Mm. Yeah. which often looks quite nice so that even if what you've found doesn't quite match up with what they've found you can say well look you know these theories, ideas are need enriching, they're a bit inadequate as they stand because what happens when somebody tells you this, what happens when somebody says this erm you know we can, we can revise them in the following way Mm. which is question section erm you know you can tell that kind of s equally Yeah. you may find that certain pe Mm. got so much dreams Mm. erm but you know when you Yeah. go through it's quite, you know Yeah. applicable a lot of Cos I mean those mental rotation tasks are, you know, fairly standard er cognitive tests that Mm. are sometimes used as part of I Q tests and things like that sometimes Right. so er that's old is it Shepherd and Metzler No it's not in this case but I think they invented the task, yes they did good old Shepherd and Metzler erm er so erm yeah er you know sort of spatial ability type Mm. things. Erm tt yeah but er so anyway whatever strands you can draw out of these things Mm. you know in terms of, not necessarily the precise content, but you can get erm some general idea about how people have studied the mental life of blind persons and how, you know, maybe it's interesting that er presumably most of the people who've studied it are themselves sighted rather than blind themselves you know That's right, yeah. I mean it's like the, the able bodied studying the disabled, men studying women Mm. whites studying blacks, you know, all those other kinds of imbalances in, in psychology in the social sciences erm which might be interesting erm cos like Guy sometimes says about erm when he was er talking to some er deaf people, well perhaps not talking's the right word but communicating with some deaf people about their, about their problems, I mean this bloke said you psychologists are all the same you just think that deaf people need cochlea implement Yeah said that. i implant and yeah that kind of thing and er whereas, you know, in this guy's view it would erm involve the erosion of, of the whole culture of sign language Mm. you know that, that you know he saw something valuable and wanted to preserve presumably so Yeah I think cos he said about that in the lecture about the Mm, yeah, mm sort of like friction it caused. Mm yeah. Yeah erm so er you know you may find some traces of a more, you know, kind of er I don't know, politicized understanding on the part of blind people as to, you know, what it means to you know kind of have their life investigated Well one of the well understand it. Yeah. We went to see Suburban Commando and then went to see Curly Sue. Right. Hello. Hello! I thought it might be. You've just interrupted my thinking session here! Ooh I know, but it's staying off so you'll realise why! Yes, I'll be in the morning. No. I will go out at half past two, well, twenty past two I shall go out and I won't be back till half past six. I mean, if you come before ten. Alright. I'll get back in from the kids ou , you know, literally, a minute past nine, so yeah. Okay then. Bye! Er, I mean, I don't go not because I don't enjoy the pictures but I think that it's got to be something really special. Yeah. But over the Christmas holidays I was prepared to take them. I didn't fancy Hot Shots, but I took them. Yeah. I fancied Suburban Commando, and that really is funny! And then I took I love ca , some comedy Yeah. like! I like and then we went to see the Curly Sue a good laugh. no it's brilliant! It really Yeah. is funny! But if you were going and choosing a pa , a film, I'd have said you'd have preferred the Hulk Hogan one. Yeah. But er I would do, yeah, I like that one that's I mean , this one doesn't look bad does it? Dunno. What's it called? Frankie and Johnny. See the cheap showing on this is five to six. Have you ever watched erm Home Alone? On video. That's good that Home Alone! Mm. He's really cruel to those two bank robbers, they're gonna rob the house like!

He er forgot my comb or summat and something like that, he said I've forgotten my comb and we might be going out. I mean, some films I think they're pathetic in so much that the story Yeah. line is very poor! Yes. And they try and do it with a lot of gimmickry and Yeah. the way they do the filming. Yeah. And, if the story line isn't very good, I don't care what they with effects the film doesn't work. Yeah. But that Suburban Commando Ah! That was good-un that! I'd like that. it was absolutely brilliant! I haven't watched it, but I'd love to watch it if ever I Yeah, it's brilliant! And I watched er, some of their clips coming on the T V like. Yeah. I was just looking but there's no wrestling on telly at the mom , it's foot er Ei either football or African football, Cameroons and Zaire. Fucking hell !

Getting all this These are foreign language ones, you can't get them in English. Oh yeah. You'll have to sit there with a book and you can That's an advert. Cos that's another sports channel. This is all advertising. This is actually one of the fas , most fascinating programmes that comes on cos you get all these just look what we can do here, you know, and all American adverts. that And cos they're really bad for that! one advert can last an hour! Ridiculous! An hour? Yeah! Mum, is yeal a word? Eh? What? Is yeal You just Y E A L? No. So you mean, it goes on all the way through with just adverts all Yee? day or Yee? Yee?

Unemployment up again! There you are, you look. Yeah. So much for er Conservative's idea of bringing down er Have you watched the Addams Family?

He couldn't say that this time cos he was i , he was erm, the guy in hospital. He's the one that, somebody tried to assassinate him or someone tried to kill him off . I must admit, er there are some good television programmes now, but they're a lot of rubbish in compared to the Yeah. story lines that you, you used to get on some of the Yeah. old series. Oh. It seems that they make so many now that they don't have the same Yeah. quality of That's it. er entertainment in them. Yeah. All we got now is adverts television is a Well the ads are a lot better sometimes than the programmes! Yeah. I used to watch erm tt, oh erm Hawaii Five O every Saturday or Friday. I mean, it used to be on a Friday, then it used to be on a Saturday, only sometimes like I used to watch it. I used to sit there Da da da da da good fun ! You know, it was a great laugh like! Now you just and sit there watch it now. I just thought I'd watch for the, you know I think it's on every erm it's on every da , ways you know Hawaii Five O is showing the old things again. I used to like the Invisible Man as well. He could vanish into thin air. Yes! I used to like that. Oh. I used to like it when he takes his head off! He'd take his bandages off. Oh I've been wa , well I've watched all of them, right, but they've made so many of those from er really old ones to the very new one. Oh. Mum. Is G, er G O D a word? G O D? Well it's God isn't it? But you can have it with a small letter. G. G. Yeah, God. No , I mean a J. J? O D. Jog? Yeah, to jog. No! J O E? No. No, you'd need to put a Y on the end, a joey, it's a sa baby kangaroo.

And in fact, waxers, one who waxes or waxes. Yeah. I'm going here. Oh! I don't like seeing that. This is mine, this is the side I like. It's live at eight o'clock in the morning. Because the Europea er, well the European clock is an hour behind us Yeah. so it's actually nine o'clock and they start. 'kin hell! And Ni nine o'clock in their Yeah. like? Yeah. And it's been coming from Austria this week Yeah. and it's been er oh it's absolutely fantastic, I think! Yeah. But I wouldn't have the nerve to do what they're doing. 'kin hell! But the exhilaration of watching them come down. Yeah. And sometimes they've got one that comes on a test run with a camera strapped onto them and you come I bet that's nice! Oh! I mean they come at they come over a hundred miles an hour on some of these runs! I know, and I hate it when they go straight up over the hills like and they Mm! do a a somersault straight over and come back down. But I mean, look at the scenery Yeah. though! Yeah. I mean you see all these mountains and I mean it just looks that beautiful and Yeah, er clear. I mean, there's no smog a, and there's no cloud or smoke anywhere is there? Yeah. It's ice isn't it, ice underneath that snow innit? Well it'll be packed ice you know, with them coming down it so much. Yeah. I don't like tennis either. I love tennis. Do, who was it was on here yesterday, erm the one that throws temper tantrums? It's blinking ! Oh well all you've got to do it's in erm Can you pick what you want to? Yeah? No! I say whether you can go and then I've put it in there. Anthony got all the words and put them in and there's this one and he's got all the good . I'm getting to like this. So it picks it up when you just do anything? Yeah. It's got seven different audio channels and you pick up languages on them. Yeah? Three comes out in British. Typical! Pick all these Mm. Two hundred and fifty pound that was. 'kin hell! Expensive! You got a lot though. I wouldn't have bought it, but it was brought as a Christmas present Yeah. for the kids because there's a little man out there who's the only one in the family who didn't have it. I wouldn't buy it. And then I said well I will buy it as a joint sort of joint family Christmas present Yeah. because he went on so much and then it was bought for him. So But er I said it's nice, something like that though. Yeah. Harry and I like it for the the sports, like the Yeah. skiing, the round up of the sports. And you get some Yeah. entertaining unusual sports that come on, but also, there's a news programme on, twenty four hour news. They mix in Yeah. a sports round up every now and again, and then you get the American C B S news comes on. Oh. And you'll get world news. Yeah. But if you come on when it's the British news you tend to get a, a more in-depth programme, it lasts longer Yeah. you get more than just the highlights of the news. So, yeah. Who's that? No! Women don't like being huffed and puffed at! No, I, no I don't. I don't get huff , I don't. Shame they huff and puff at me, oh I don't like it! No. They, they don't like it when you stand and laugh and you know, joke with them and that. Joke about it and all that, they don't like it then. Is it er you know only little girls like I mean, crumbs! Yeah! I've got one. And when you talk sensibly to them and that you know, about ja , that and too old for you like that, something like that I, I get really erm you know, really erm when they erm they, they start to laugh but you're not quite funny and that. So all I do, you gotta jo , joke about it all that. Yeah. So it makes it erm in fact, it does upset them sometimes, you know, we, you know like the other way around they can't stand it when you you know, when you can er hate it like that. If you don't take it, you know, if you can't take the joke they give you, they just they get really upset about it. Oh. Ho . She's crazy! Driving me mad! Then she erm she told me a lie this time as well! I erm, did something to her friend like erm you know, this lad she's supposed to be going with, I dunno what she's doing with him or anything. And I'm not bothered if she's, cos she, he's er, she's he's, she's going out with him or anything. Just if she'll, you know, just if she could be friends with me still, you know, and that? But erm anyway, she told a lie to me this time. See she, she came around cos erm I've been up to her, her friends place to and give him a bit of a telling off like and that and erm she came to John's house and I said, why are calling? I said you only come round to see me cos, you know, cos I al I always wanted to come round and see you so and she won't. And she says, I haven't come round to see you actually! I've come round to see John. This is like her, ex-husband like. And I said okay. Well I'm just joking by saying you've come round to see me haven't you? And that, and sh , and she goes, no I've only come round to see John cos of his birthday you see. So er I thought a alright then, so I I went off like and I just heard erm and said, I went up to see her mother like and, I told her mother about it, like and that and erm her mother says different now, that she came round to see me at the time to tell, to give me a telling off like over her friend. So I mean, John was right, she did come to see me that time. And Ah! But she didn't want you to know about this. Yeah. And another thing, she didn't have to do well her mother's erm her mother-in-law seems a bit erm bad tempered with her, like, she's is that she didn't have to tell John, her ex-husband that there's anything the matter like and and, and that's when she she, all she wants to do is get him against me. She's trying to make me and him enemies. Cos me and him are good friends, like. He likes me and, and I like him, he's we've both got things in, in common, like. She's probably jealous then of your relationship with him. Might be, yeah. She could be. I dunno. I mean, if she had a marriage with him and she had the relationship and now you're a good friend to him, and you're a friend to her, she's probably very jealous of the fact that you're Mm. friends with her ex-husband. Yeah. Well, could be. I thought of that. I , things keep going through my head every time my head's like it got this little what do you call it in, one of those erm like a live wire, just keeps going up and down and all the time. I'm trying to work out why she's mad all the time, why she's she's down on everything. And I can't understand her, I can't keep up with her! You know? I mean, I mean, you know, John, you should see him he's happy! Every time I go to see him, like, he's happy as anything like. He's a good guy! Okay, he's a I think, then again, sometimes I think why she left him is because the way his, his house is, you see. Cos the way he has his house it's like er been a okay he's off er, I know it may sound nasty what I say about him, but he's alright, he's a good guy like, his house is a bit of a upside down place, like Mm. it's only cos he's had it done up and that. And erm her place is oh, it's just really lovely inside, everything! You know, really warm, the fire's on, everything and and nice and cosy and everything like. And, and I think is it that because she left him? I was trying to think of all these things like she's done like. I dunno, I'm just, I give up on her anyway! I haven't seen her for two weeks now. Trying to pack up seeing her now ! It's like er er but now I've heard her telling this lie again, I mean, oh, I'm thinking of going and seeing her again. Asking her what's she doing it for? Yeah, why , why. I dunno I can't understand it though! Mm. I mean, why didn't she tell me the truth, I can understand you know, I could, you know, I could perha if she'd just tell me the truth you know tell me why she's u , what she's up to and that. Why does she have to tell me lies like, I mean what's she trying to hide you know? It's like she's got some big thing going like, got some big drugs thing going, like, and she's trying to hide! Some big thing, you know. And there's nothing to it, I mean crumbs! Probably just her own Oh. personal problems that she she knows that if she loses her temper with you she won't really offend you. Perhaps Well that that's a good thing that you are a friend to her, that you'll take her tempers and you'll still come back. And the fact that she can lose her temper with you Mm. you, you are just at the end of the line, and you take it off her so you take the pressure off her. She probably thinks a lot more about you for being able to Yes. take that pressure from her. I know. I always feel, I always feel, what do you call it, for punishment though? You're masochist? Yeah, I'm maso Thank you ! I think she could be truthful. Keep going back for more and more. True. Yeah. And er Sound a bit more like you're Nightmare on Elm Street! True, yeah! Blinking,e every time I walk into that place. Nobody comes to see you! You know, once when I was in Wembley like, another thing that I've noticed that changed in our place at Wembley, like every time I used to go in there, all, well, when I used to be in there, like, all the lads would be in the office with her like talking to her, and laughing and smiling and and she used to be at the desk smiling and everything and now, when I walk in there now it's only me like on a Saturday, and it's only her like nobody else is in there with her, she's al , she always she's got, I think what's happened is she got too deep into her work that she's she just seems to take all her work now and that. Cos she doesn't have any relationships with the other Yeah. people that were there. Yeah. So erm and here's another thing as well, she says erm I said why don't you pack this job in like? And you know, you know, I feel li , I feel like she's she's a nice woman like, you know, I say, why don't you pack the job in? She says, I can't now I've gotta keep my family. And, and that, cos tha , cos she hasn't got her husband anymore, her husband's got a good job like, getting well into, something like and he's got, got loads of money! He's got really lovely car and everything, and and that, got nice house and and er anyway she's she says I can't. Says I've gotta keep my family now cos she's keeping her, er daughter in what do you call it, and her son like, every time he comes up. And and when she had er well like she says, I can't now. But I, I don't understand, now she can't but if she went back to her husband he's got money, I mean, he can look after her as Yeah, but well. going back to him just cos he's got money, if she doesn't love him any more and she can't live with him because of the relationship. Yeah. You can't compromise your feelings just because of the money. Yeah. But I mean it's not just that, she's killing herself for the job like! Sa , she her eyes are getting blacker every time and she she just seems to be in her books all the time, and everything now. I mean, she doesn't stop work, she never stops work! She goes on and on and on! Well when you're being paid for doing a job that's the price you pay if you want to keep in work. Well I wouldn't do that. I don't think I could do that. Well you'd have to i It'd kill me! If you've got responsibilities of a family and you've got to keep them, then, as a mother she knows she's got her children to look Yeah. after. She'll stay there even if she doesn't like it because she's got to provide for them. That's a responsibility you take on with a family. Yeah. Or even if she doesn't like, and as much as she says, well she doesn't like it she can't give it up until they're old enough not Yeah. to be a responsibility to her. Yeah, well I think it's through her job she's left her husband like. Her husband was the one who got her the job as well! And I mean, well she's married and everything, and kids. I could understand that in , I could understand that he's Yeah. probably left her because of the job in that sense He didn't leave because her, she she left him. well He le , I think he left but probably her because Yeah. she couldn't she just didn't smile every time like, she was it's like, I think it's something to do with, sounds like it's something to do with the parents maybe. Something like, you don't know, I just, I ge , all these things like, keep just coming into your head all Mind you, the relationships between the time. the man and a wife you'd never know what the problem was because the relationships that will be private to them. Yeah I know. Well I don't know But they'd let you well I know that. they'd never let you into that. I know. Well to that, I just Mm. I keep everything to myself. But it, it just seems funny, you know! The way she treats me, now. Cos I'm a bit like John, like happy, you know I'll laugh every time like and he'll have a joke and that and erm John's happy, and he'll laugh. And he's into heavy metal and and we, we both seem to have things in common like and she do doesn't like me and she doesn't erm you know, she seems the same with me as as she is with John. And this other guy she's going with now he doesn't smile, nothing! He, I I used to hi to him, like he used to work at Wembley as well and I used to go, obviously we were walking, coming out of the place like, and I'd say I'd go, hi there! And he'd go, and he'd just just walk on like! Ignore me! Mm. He wouldn't smile, nothing! No. Seems down all the time. They're probably both very happy in their misery together. Well I dunno. Could be. You know I wish I was, I could be happy in misery. Mm! Mm! You know. But I can't, me, I mean, I've gotta be happy cos a it's the only thing today, is happy. Yeah. Or die sad and I'd hate that! You know, I couldn't put up with that, I mean You're better off being happy. You're Yeah. happy on the outside it and you show you're happy on the outside you'll invariably be happy on the inside. And it's that where it counts. Yeah. And I I like being happy. I mean He might try and come down again What before before then, but you know it depends Yeah cos he's, this Friday he's taking a group erm youngsters to Paris Is he? That had been booked you see before Yeah in fact he was also booked at Easter to go to the erm to Florence But he couldn't again, but he's had to cancel that Yeah, someone else has got to obviously in his place Either that or I'd imagine the people that went before have to sort of do it, but as I say he wasn't er, er we went up at dinner time on the next day and, because he went back after he the morning again, and we took Daniel up to the er, cos there was a station, Christopher picked him up there and off they went you see so erm haven't heard anything I presume he got back alright but as I say How's Carris taken all this anyway now? Mm? How's Carris taken all this now? Well seemingly she's erm A bit resigned to it now? a bit more resigned, there's another, there's another sort of erm possibility, I mean if they sold their house quickly of course then, you know they'd come down here obviously and they'd try and look for something, but it's not likely that they'd sell their house that quickly No but if they did and They sell it you know they'd all come down, but if they don't, erm Christopher would travel possibility is that Marilyn would stay up there for another year with Carris you know in their house and Timothy of course and erm, then sort of move down here What after Carris has done her er GCSEs? I imagine so, is she due to do them next year? No she's not No she's not you see she's no got another year after that after that oh I thought she was I would of thought I would of thought is she, if they're gonna move this year is the year she's def gotta do it Yeah well Christopher knows that Yeah but erm, if everything else being equal obviously that would be the thing to do Yes, that'd be me but if they can't well they won't want to be separated for well he twelve months twelve months or so He's going to be going up erm each weekend if this happens Oh yeah I mean that's that's the and erm Marilyn will come down of course when she's at, she's worried as well about whether she's going to get a job, cos er, I mean they need to have erm a second income I should think Well yeah, but I don't think the job's erm, I mean that's not the problem for her because she can always go on the agency you see and she can do general midwifery Oh on the agency can you? Oh yeah, I mean, I mean she can like she used to go to an old person's home of a night time you know Yeah or, or days, you can pick actually just when you want to do it Oh yeah that's what she'll get something she'll get paid , she'll get paid travelling and everything for that so that er I don't see that that's erm No well that's probably erm no I don't think that's a problem no that's not a great consideration I I don't see that as a Well I think it's just I mean that could be a short term until she could get herself you know a full time regular post It's erm, you know, mostly Carris of course Yeah I mean I think if they can but she means if they sell their house they'll come down more every year then Yes because in the summer I mean you, some time in the, in this next term would be the ideal thing really because that, if she can stay on for the summer term Before September that's right erm well most of it I mean she'll be take and erm Yes like in September Timothy Timothy will take his O levels you see during the summer term, well I mean by the end of June he'd of finished those so that September would be the ideal time for erm, you know, to be starting down Well July, August I mean any Well yeah To get settled in Yeah Mm but erm and as things are at the moment I think it But Chris Christopher's very much more happy to have met up with Bob in the office to see what he's you know the thoughts of Yeah, he, he'd come away I think rather happy I he, he nev , you know he begun to see here He's had some more idea , he had no idea what be expected of him or anything Yeah and this Bob erm has sort , he's been quite marvellous, he's set up some fantastic things He's getting an O B E in Is he? Yeah he's getting an O B E next next week isn't it? next week or something, yeah Is he? And he's written books and all the rest of it and in fact he's, he's going to be erm lecturing at Royal College Mm, mm you know after he gets out from here on a temporary basis sort of thing, so that erm Christopher says he's gonna be doing it for a year this lecturing, but it's very nice for him because he'll be able to contact him and Bob will help him if it's necessary It'd be a difficult situation that will be for Chris then won't it I mean Well Chris says he's gotta keep in with him for a little while, he said he Right he said I'd, I'd, I'd, I'd rather have, rather have him as a friend than an enemy And how did he get out of the Chris think he'd get on with him? Oh very well Alright Was he on the panel, on the board? I don't think so no, but you know I mean, for six months if Christopher's living here and having to go back at the weekend, for six months he gets an allowance A travelling allowance, so Get it, yeah that would save them yeah but what that doesn't take into account is the tiredness factor is it? Oh no it doesn't Because you work, you work the long days and go, go by train He'll go back by train no question of Chris driving Go by train yeah, but you've, but you've actually got to do this, I mean, that's right I know it doesn't, but at least it Yeah, not fair enough, yes and he gets moving allowance as well Yeah, erm removal expenses So, I mean it's Yeah We don't know anything Oh, no that's more than that, nor does he really I haven't liked to phone him up because it, you know, I certainly don't want to be, thought that, yeah, yeah, try and be nosy or anything like that, it erm But that I mean we didn't even know he was coming, father rang up on erm It was ever so funny really Yeah because I had said to father during the day on Sunday, I wonder if any of our children are alive? Because we haven't heard or seen any of them or anybody Well I was, I was at No I'm not talking Not you no it wasn't you was talking we were thinking Bridget even hasn't phoned us either I was out on the moor from, it's been a hell of a fortnight really No, no, not, not sort of getting at, anyway I had just said that to father you see Yeah I'd phoned up so father said well I'll erm go and see if erm Christopher's Timothy answered the phone you see erm there so Timothy said oh he said well you want to know what time he's coming tomorrow I said pardon he said well hasn't he told you? I said what? He said oh he says perhaps it was gonna be a surprise I've put my foot in it again perhaps I shouldn't of told you, so I said well look Timothy I said this is a conversation that hasn't taken place I said when Christopher comes back in I said if you want to say anything you can, but feel free not to and we'll just, if he comes we won't know anything about it Play it by ear that, that way, he must of said something because Christopher phoned up and said I'm coming down tomorrow He did say something Christopher told me that Oh he did, did he? and I are off tomorrow and it's the first day off that we've had together you know, for Alright then, so are you gonna go out or something? I might , well no we're not Go and have some lunch or something Well I dunno, I don't know what we'll do, it's, there's plenty of work to be done around, but I've been out every night this week and I'm in tonight thank goodness, I need to be in Mm erm, what's it? Twenty five miles over the moor for the weekend Oh and then of course, change the subject completely, we've just, we've been out this morning, have we been out this morning? We've been out together this morning, yes We've been out this morning, that's right , we got back in and I was then going to go over to Saint Mary's church club, I wanted to go to the bank at Saint Mary's church, and erm, back door bell goes ding ding ding ding ding and I think it's Chris cos Chris is normally the only one, go out there and who should it be? It's Bill and his missus, do you remember Bill who used to caretake at school? No you wouldn't know but he was the caretaker at father's school, wonderful man, absolutely, he's got god knows what he hasn't got wrong with him, but he has sort of which he's made himself Good lord He's he's made two of those up there you see Two of those numbers up there are his as well and a painting That's a cat and a fiddle Yes, strewth, what was I gonna say? I tell you, you're talking about names in the past, Fred do you remember Fred he was Yes, yes Yes, yes er Fred and er, I can't remember what his wife was called now Joan Joan that's right, I met them down the town in Torquay Oh gosh, I haven't seen them for a Well Fred was working for erm Now what was their name?

Yeah and I said to her erm, and she said I don't know how it came out about her son in the fire service, oh I know she'd just come back from Orlando, cos she'd been off work having had a hysterectomy and she had three week's leave due to her And you said your son's going to Orlando so she went to erm Orlando I am so I said oh my son's going there sort of erm this summer and er she said oh don't they live you know locally, so I said well in Newton Abbott and erm he works in the fire service So does my son and so Ray told me about it, he said that erm this bloke ah he said that ah she's a lovely lady she really is so but then after, not after, before then, I was sitting up waiting to give my bloody when Mrs said Pat's Pat's wife Yeah er Pat's, Pat's mother Mm she used to live in she said to me, erm Oh he's in the fire service?

Erm Oh Angela and er actually Joan was quite embarrassed because she heard that you were in a box Oh goodness gracious and I said well she wasn't the last time I saw her She said oh I'm ever so sorry, she said perhaps it's your mother, I said no I said she was alive and kicking as well the last time I saw her so Oh she probably heard that I had not been well Well that's right that'll be it that's what I'd guessed, erm, so I said no, I said they're fine, so she said oh I'm ever so sorry I said don't be I said these sort of things get around, I mean it's, she kept go and then I went on to describe how I virtually done not too a dissimilar thing going up the road trying to talk to people about writing in to object, you know with this planning application and erm, I said I sort of knock on someone's door up there and I thought it was the next door that the husband had died and it was that one Oh dear Mm, mm you can't help putting I'm going to go to the planning committee meeting there Are you? on Monday and then happily leave around about ten o'clock So you can go alright can you? Oh yeah They'll, they'll allow you to go? Oh yeah you're allowed to go in and watch, you're not allowed to say anything, but I just wanna go in and, and er See who says what Yeah Yeah, that's a good idea, mm Yes well I mean had we had any idea about this, obviously father would of Didn't even go to the committee dear, this one Didn't even no I've never even went to the committee, yours was That was, that was the trouble with ours going to a committee absolutely I'm sure of that Well I mean it's , it's well as soon as, it's, well did you write in and object in within the time? Oh yeah, yes I wrote, I wrote a foolscap letter with about nine points on it and somebody who, the architect, Chris's architect next door said with a letter like that going in, it must go to the committee Mm so I wasn't bothered, but it didn't go to the committee and now, afterwards when I Mm then it was too late But you can't appeal against it, you can't appeal against it No, no No that's right they, they can appeal they can appeal Yeah but you can't and I think it's very wrong that one man should have, be almighty god really, do This present mayor was away on holiday at the time, he said perhaps that I should of seen that erm it would go to committee I mean I have gone to the trouble, I have been in to see the planning officer that's dealing with it, erm I've written to every single member of the planning committee, I've written to the Environmental Health who have written back to me saying they offer no objections and there because the smell won't be a problem so I've written them back another stinking letter and saying well erm Come and live next door I, I completely disagree with your thoughts on the fact that there won't be a smell, so much so that the slightest smell if the, if the er proposal gets the go ahead and I shall be on to your office and asking to speak to you personally, to come and smell this erm And the rubbish, I mean the, the environmental people Oh they, they say it's all controllable so that I've, I've answered, I haven't just let the Environmental Health wash over me I've actually written back to them again, er I'll be interested to see whether I get a letter back from them, but I phoned up the Council this morning and they're rejecting on two grounds, one is to do with the highway and the sort of the traffic situation coming in there, although the, the authority, the Highway Department aren't objecting to it and the other one is erm, on local environmental issues I think you know that is, is unsuitably, unsuitable environmentally to the area well I can only say that I'm grateful to the planning, to the planning offices for they're going out on a limb if you like because I think they're on thin ice erm and so long as the committee will, will back them up I mean I don't know of what else I could of done as a person No nothing, I don't think you could of done any more, you got it to committee and, and there's nothing more than you can do than that erm, so that if, if they then go to an appeal er, I was talking to this planning officer and I was saying that I think I'll consult them, he said I don't think you'll need to he said, and of what you've done so far is pretty good and I can get access to all the letters that have been written in, in objecting into the into the homes Have a lot of other people written in and objecting? I think there's I think there's quite a few and I think this is what swayed it, the fact that they have had erm, I know of at least ten say ten, there's one, two, three on the other side of the road which is good because Bob which is another one, so that's four, there's which is the other side of the shop, is five, there's us, six, Jean seven, the eight, erm the guy the other side of the which is nine, there is Ginny over the and the erm old persons' home, that's ten that I know of for certain about, er and then I've heard of other people were gonna be writing in, now whether they actually did or not I don't know Mm, as you, see you, you really do need but I'm sure, if if I've had ten objections, I mean I've done You've done very well by that, you know You really have been to houses I wish we of had that knowledge when Had we known about it because this is the sort of thing we could of gone We would of done the same sort of thing and could of gone in to see the planning officer but I just, I just assumed you know that, that life was fair but of course there's no justice in this life But er, the only, the only, yes, no the only other thing I would of said that you could of perhaps done would be go to to a Local Authority ombudsman Well I, we went there afterwards Did you and what did he say? but it was too late you see and there was no, I mean It was passed I, I couldn't produce any evidence of malpractice, I mean I could No think what I'd like, but I couldn't prove anything and erm, so there was nothing that the ombudsman could do at that stage, at, as the stage complete Yeah erm and there was nothing that a Member of Parliament could do, this is the trouble I mean it, it with everybody was saying you should of contacted us before it went to I'm going to see Patrick tomorrow, there's a coffee morning up in the village, but erm Well you went to see him and he, he is very keen to try and change the law so that people like you and I who is can appeal can, can appeal against the decision which goes against us, it's, its not fair that we because we we're the third party we're not allowed to appeal against it It's not fair that the, the other people I know can appeal but you can't I know the person whose house, I mean, I've spoken to Jane at some length and I'll probably ring her tonight erm but erm, I, I might go around and see old erm tomorrow at a coffee morning I think up in the village But I think that he I find he's Anything he does he's very sympathetic to the likes of at least, at least you've got it's going to committee, it's not gonna be just on the on the rest on one man One person with er yeah erm who will undoubtedly he'll have favourable contacts with the person who was applying. I mean as I'm, I don't think they had any option with this I think because it's a change of usage, considerable change of use then it had to go before the committee, erm but erm It's okay, even if they get send down then of course they can still appeal but you can't it's ridiculous Well it's not fair No That's right and, so I don't know, we erm we live in hopes anyway. And how's Helen? Alright, I mean she's working long and hard and er How does she think she'll do with her A levels? Well I think Has she had her mocks yet? No, not yet she's, she's had an accept, I'm taking her up to Cardiff on Wednesday on a B and two Cs, the thing Yeah Oh for going to university? Yeah What about her er York which she's had She hasn't heard from York she's heard from Leicester She hasn't heard from them yet and she's got an acceptance from them on a B and two Cs Oh has she? erm Because it was York that was stopping her listing wasn't it? What she going to , what she applying to get a degree? History History The trouble is, I mean I can take, I can take her up to Bristol er Cardiff next week, but there's another thing to, to Leicester and I can't get her up to Leicester although she on a train, because I've got a governor's meeting that day and, and I can't avoid not being at that governor's meeting because I'm a chairman Yeah of the building and sites Yeah erm ha, I dunno When is it for Leicester? Do you know I can't remember the date, early part of March, early part of March, erm what she says at the moment is that er someone else from the college is going to Leicester next Wednesday when Helen's going to Cardiff and this girl is then going to Cardiff when Helen should be going to Leicester, so Helen says, and she wants to look at the same subjects as what Helen does so Helen says that they're gonna sort of go to the different colleges and compare notes when they come back from it so she might needn't want to go to Leicester Mm erm, so I just, I just don't know, erm, so we just Daniel was saying hasn't she heard from any of her so I said I don't honestly, I only know that er, erm which is quite nice to have fir to have an acceptance to anyway Yeah very good so I don't think she'll get an acceptance to York on a B and two Cs I think York is one of the better Try thinking, do you know somebody used better I think to swear about Southampton for history I don't know, I can't remember whether she applied for that, I know Harold his daughter went up to Southampton and he was horrified at the accommodation she was staying in, up there But I know that erm, for I think I've just about finished with it Oh have you? Have you? We've not had an appointment to go back have we since you've been home, but I suppose it was been October when we went I've had , I've had two hundred pounds worth, I've given her a cheque for two hundred pounds Have you really? What on earth have they done well he had all sorts of I've had two, two, three crowns That's only fifteen shillings I've had a new plate, I've had a hell of a lot with, with a one of the something to one of the teeth Yeah crown dropped off so she had to put that back on, she never put, I had to get erm have another fitting for it, because she said the purpose of pins in her teeth in the tooth to try and get the crown to sit on, on the pins, erm Darling Er I know, he's, he's told me and in fact last time I saw him I took, I took the cheque around on Monday, I had the, the last appointment on Friday and erm since I've had the abscess, the tooth that's got a crown on top, I think it's been pushed up a little bit and my top teeth, the first two keeps catching was this well it never has done I mean that, it's always been like that I've never had erm I can put together It's naughty of your mother not to let you have them Oh, but this, it was catching the tooth that had the abscessing underneath it Yeah god was it painful, and erm, so the crown has got a filling in it now because she, to, to relieve the pressure on the abscess she had to drill right down through the crown, erm to go right through into the root area Get me ash to get rid of the abscess, oh god it was painful, it really was, in fact I had it once, I had a load of penicillin, didn't finish the penicillin and it came back again and they had to give me a stronger drug then for five days Oh I see Did you erm, did you that's the trouble with them have any help? Yeah, put it all, I mean they I put that in as of course you get that Yes you get that back? I have to pay tax on that lot mind, but I mean it's something you know like it's still costing me fifty pounds Yeah erm but still that's a bit better than two hundred Yeah Oh erm And Paul is them thing wasted I mean, I don't know, ha got danger damage in the back of his head I think at times he's so laid back, he's doing, he's doing erm the C grade for maths now, that's what he's gonna apply to, to go for Where, what? For C grade in maths What is that? Well it's the intermediate maths Yeah Oh I see yeah We bought , we bought him a load of revision books erm from Smith's er not for maths but for chemistry, biology, physics,ma , not maths something else, Cherry went and bought four of them and Helen had got one for French anyway, so we told him he's got to erm get down to some serious Serious work serious work on him weekend they're coming The, the erm the maths, is this erm He's quite confident about the maths now with intermediate, he says that er, he doesn't see He hopes to get a one weekend after he doesn't see any problems with that at all, no Was that the one that Helen should of done? She, they should of put her in for the intermediate Yeah they put her in, they put in for the higher Mm, mm Yeah Mind you, you see in the long run they proved that she was Well all, all that good enough to do it all that proved to me is, is that Helen the board, the examination board that Helen did at the college, she said it was a much, a much better exam to do than it was at Was it? she felt much happier about doing it Mm and it's a different, it was a different exam to the one she was doing at Cuthbert Main, so I don't know, erm I'm not certainly enough qualified to arguing about qualified matters No, no No at school I hear is sort of going back quite a bit Oh he does quite a bit of, he does a bit of erm supplying it Tony told me and but er right I've gotta get back to work we've had er a man rang to the hall clearing out thing, that erm they'd left, father's gotta go down there next Tuesday so Yeah the stag group has definitely wound up, the whole lot has been wound up the, the erm, there are tents and all sorts of things you said they were comparatively new, erm because remember that big Mind you the tents up there didn't look very new actually, I know one but there was one or two bits of tent then Oh I don't know what they do, but do you remember that great big jumble sale they had that raised over a thousand pounds? They had under the erm, What the Scouts? multi storey? Yeah yeah Four or five years ago now Well that was sort of mostly to, to be buying erm Tents tents, but Who yeah just phoned in to find out where the flags were, but it doesn't see the flags It wasn't Andre that, that comes around here? No, erm Ferchase? No, where's my diary, I've got, I've got his name in my diary Erm actually Kay got in touch with this man and in fact she had got Andre's name as well sort of It's, er you know I yes, I erm he's a, he's retired, I mean he, he doesn't have anything very Ivor somebody Ivor somebody, no just a thought How old is he? Oh sixty five, seventy Sixty, no it's not him Retired haven't they, because if somebody came to you cos you see, he was so upset about it I think he's coming I think he's coming up to the high week group, what is he? He's something he's, he's, he's some, something to do with er with er, with the area and erm, and he's coming up for the high week group some time in the next, little while, and I said to him you were the group's up there Yeah, what did he say? Oh I think he was just surprised, I don't think he knew, you know, I mean Because I'm on a district executive committee at the moment and I don't, that name doesn't ring a bell He's erm Kay knows him cos he's he's about , I suppose he's about my height probably slightly slimmer Slimmer erm and I would of thought he's sixty eight something like that Oh gosh no, well I don't know who that is, I've got no idea He's got , he's got a big, a very big scout badge on his lapel And he had a scout badge on his tie, did you notice that? No I didn't notice that on the tie, yeah I wonder who that is? Kay knew him, she rang him up Well I mean if it, if group through in Glasgow who've been H, on H R T now for twenty three years! Up there. I think if you went and saw our own doctors a lot of our fears would be allayed because most of the young doctors wouldn't, would recommend to you, my own doctor asked me all the questions and different things and then he says he's a young doctor, he says if I were a women and if I'd answered all the questions as you did, I would go on H R T. So, there might be a lot of doctors who would do. Right. Beside you? Yes. Yes? I think you really highlights on working alongside with your doctor. I think you'll be able to read up as much information as possible and see a doctor and consult and especially th where women's clinic are, a great boom! And we should attend Mm. it more often. Up there. I would just like to say that erm, it's not all gloom and doom! Mm. The menopause isn't necessarily the end of our life, it can be the beginning of so many new different things. Yes? I I think erm, that it can be looked at to, without H R T or looking at it medically, because lots of the women at Dean Terrace, in fact have That's a family planning er problem That's right! situation. Yep! but erm, have erm problems with what this lady has described who can't come to terms with Mhm. the er loss of their fertility and the loss of their children and, have sexual problems and problems like that, and they don't necessarily need H R T they need lots of time, which they're given. And I think that helps them an awful lot! Is it impossible that your sex life might improve after the menopause? I mean I I wo er would anything like to say anything about Do we have to? No! a friend's experience or anything like that? Nelly? Yes I would like to say, it was smashing after the because you didn't have to worry that you were gonna have another child! So, though I had a bad time, well I had a, I've had a great life since! Good! Up there? What do you do about er, a doctor who says no? I mean, do you change your doctor or what? Yes. Who would like to answer that one? Yes? Get more information first, so that you know all your facts and if you ask us we'll send him a booklet without saying who er, who asked us to send it and then go in and see him and say, now the Osteoporosis Society have said this and it's a very brave doctor who will then say absolutely no! I'm, I'm not listening to you! But, in the final analysis, if you can't get any help, if he won't refer you to a specialist for help change your doctor! Because if the garage did your car badly you wouldn't have any hesitation in in changing your garage and your body's a darn sight more important than your car! I think women can sail into a beautiful old age with enthusiasm for hobbies, taking up new interests of all sorts and I've taken up skiing after the age of fifty and I'm, I feel I'm getting on well with it and this fresh air and and you know, getting out and finding who you really are after, you know, looking after children is is a wonderful thing! And this will keep you young! I don't have H R T, I didn't have any problems luckily, with the menopause but I feel I've I've found a bit more of who I really am, you know! I'm very interested in that because that is what Germaine Greer says in her book, it's only after the menopause that you have the freedom and the liberty, to find out Yes! Yes it who you really are! Does Exactly! does does does anybody, yes! Yes. Well I had a hysterectomy when I was forty nine and to me life really did begin at fifty! I go dancing! I'm now sixty two and I go dancing twice a week! So, I mean apart from arthritis life's quite good! Here. Can I say, I'm thirty six and had a hysterectomy a year ago. Mhm. I'm taking flushes and whatever but I feel brand new compared to what I felt before I had a hysterectomy cos I was totally lifeless! And I can agree with the ladies that say life begins once you get by all these problems that you had before. Up there. As a younger person I, I would expect that I've probably got another fifteen years to go to the menopause, but I'm looking forward to it as a relief from pre-menstrual syndrome! And, I wondering if any of the experts can say if there's erm a link between the severity of menopausal symptoms and pre-menstrual symptoms? Okay a final, final expert view on that. Who would like to offer a fortunately no. Yo erm your er it isn't your fate in life to have all this pro , though major problems erm, and I think P M S is a major problem. And, in fact er I would hopeful that you will be feel better. Yes. Mm. I have a question to the politicians. The N H S cannot cope in the moment with you know, regular sort of cervical cancer smears. Mhm. How can they cope in the future with sort of er monitoring the effects of H R T? Well er, that's for politicians watching, think about it to care about! Yes? Well if er, more women do take hormone replacement therapy and we cut the osteoporosis we will in fact have far money in the health service besi , because it costs a hundred and eighty million pounds a year to treat hip fractures alone at the moment! Germaine Greer has coined a term which you may have read, which is er which is called PM zed! Or PM zee, I suppose in America which she terms post-menopausal zest! Is post menopausal zest something that er every woman could look forward to if she gets the right advice, the right Definitely! treatment? Yes,! I think this being an old hag is what is all in the mind! If you're determined to enjoy the rest of your life you will! Be positive! Be positive about it, yes! I don't agree with that Sheena! No! You only have to listen to what women here have told you and it's not psychological! It's a myth! It is physiological! And there are plenty of people who have spoken here tonight have substantiated that! Mhm. , my first years had two children, had no breast problems and I'm having a horrendous time just now and I'm on H R T, I'm on my third different kind! And I've had so , examinations and my doctor is very good! Do , the doctor I have now is very good and very sympathetic! But she feels there's nothing you actually can do to help me with! Final word? As I've said, I've been on H R T for three years and, I have since went back to work after being on H R T I don't think I'm an old hag! I don't want to be like a film star, but I do want a better quality of life and I've got that with H R T! We're going to have to end and I'm sorry about that because er, it's been very interesting! You've heard a very broad range of views, erm, of all sorts! I think the most important thing that we've done is talk about it. Ninety one people here wanted more information. There is information available. I hope you can find it, er if yo if er if you want and and the important thing is to keep talking about it, keep exchanging information. Thanks everybody here for your experiences and information! Goodbye! Somebody once said that if angelism, sharing the gospel was one beggar telling another beggar about bread, where it could be found and undoubtedly when he was saying that he was thinking of that story that account that we had read to us earlier from the second book of kings, chapter seven, and I'd like us to er turn back to us for a few moments this morning and perhaps draw some lessons for ourselves Sometimes as Christians its very easier for us to say what sins are, and we can see other people's failings, you don't have to be a Christian to do that of course, plenty of other people can do that, they see the failings of other people, they see the wrong doing they do, they see their wickedness their, their waywardness, whatever words we want to use to describe it, and we say well that is sin, perhaps for most of us this morning we could make er a list a, a, a tabulate a table of sins and we might say well they are worse sins and there are lesser sins and I would I suppose by and large there would be a fairly reasonable consensus of opinion regarding what was sins and what were not sins. Sometimes the bible surprises us a little bit of course, and it puts it finger on things that we perhaps don't really want to talk about or we don't even consider as sins and the bible is quite clear that not all sins are what we do often there what we don't do in parable that Jesus told concerning the traveller, the man who went down to Jericho, we don't condemn the priest and the levite for what they did, but we do condemn them for what they didn't do, their sin was not what they did, it was what they left undone, going over and looking at the man was very note worthy, as least there was some interest there and we don't condemn them for that, but we do condemn them for hurrying along and not reaching out and helping the man in the Pistol of James and chapter four and verse seventeen James says there, any one then who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it, sins so the sins that you and I comment or the sins rather that we are guilty of are not just the things that we do there of times the things that we don't do and sometimes there more difficult for us to put a finger on, we can justify them so very easily its been said that all it needs for evil to triumph, is for good men to say or to do nothing well lets look at the, that,illu illustration there that we have in the second book of kings. As I mentioned early the, the city of Sermaria it was under siege and the army of Seria was encamped all around it, Ben Hadad was a great warrior, he would of been the, the Alexander or the Napoleon of his day and he had set up this encampment around the city of Sermaria, nobody could get in, nobody could get out and very quickly the stocks of food and water er were used up, rationing would of been introduced but it only lasted for a certain period, they'd got to the stage it tells us in the previous chapter that er, that a donkeys head was sold for eighty shekel's of silver and some folk had even got to the, had sunk to the level of cannibalism, of eating their own children and the city was, when they heard about this they were in an uproar and they started blaming god and in between the city of Sermaria of all its suffering and hopelessness and helplessness and the army encamped about with all of their supplies, there was this area of no mans land in which they were caught up four men who were leapers and they were trapped there, they didn't want to go over to the Serians because they'd be killed, they didn't want to go back into the city because they weren't allowed there and any way what was the point, they'd only die of starvation in there and so these four men are caught up in no man's land and yet their no better off than people in the city, now god had promised deliverance, through his serve and Eliger he had promised deliverance, Eliger said tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour shall be sold for a se shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of Semaria, he said the gates are gonna be open, there's gonna be food and its gonna be a reasonable price and it says the royal officer who's hand the king was leaning on said the man of god said behold, if the lord shall make windows in heaven could such a thing be, he said don't talk stupid man, how can such a thing happen for us?, he didn't believe what god servant said and Eliger brings out to him a terrible judgment, he says because of your unbelief you will see it, but your not participate in it but lets look at these four men for a moment, cos that's where our real interest lies this morning, I just wanted to say three things in their experience, the first things is that they were amazed that, at what they found, because after they come together and they talk about it and they said well what shall we do and they weighed the pro's and the cons and Semaria doesn't look very attractive with its cannibalism, they said well the least if we stay here were gonna die, if we go into Semaria we'll die, lets go down to the Serein camp, the worse they can do to us is put us to death and were dying men any way, but they may just take pity on us, we maybe allowed to grope around in their dustbins and get some scraps of food, they may at least allow us that, and so they make their way down just as evening is falling, they make their way down to the Serein lines and when they get there, they are amazed at what they find, you see their condition was helpless and hopeless, they were dying men any way, they were lepers, but they were dying of starvation, that was far more imminent than their leprosy, their problems and their needs were greater than themselves, they could not meet their own needs, their problems and their needs were greater than their government, the king in Semaria and all of his court could not meet the needs of his people and then in verse five, we read something there, they arose at twilight to go to the camp of Aramians or the Serein's and when they came to the outskirts of the camp of the Serein's behold there was no one there, they expected to at least meet a guard, there would surely be somebody on sentry duty even if the rest of the soldiers had gone in to their tents and were perhaps getting ready for their, for the evening, going to bed or whatever they were gonna be doing, having their evening meal, there would at least be somebody on guard duty, but when they got there, there was no one there, god had stepped in, god had intervened and the good news of the Christian gospel is that god has intervened in our, in the midst of our helplessness, in the midst of our hopelessness, god has intervened, he had stepped in to history, so often you'll hear folks say, well why doesn't god do something, why does god allow this to happen, why does god allow that one, why doesn't he do something all they really show by that comment is their own ignorance, because god has done something, god has intervened, listen to what it says in John three sixteen, for god so loved the world that he gave, he's only son and the er, the er apostle Paul and he's writing to the Gallations, in chapter four and in verses four and five hear what he says there,but when the time had fully come god sent his son, born of a woman, born under law to redeem those under law that we might receive the full rights of son, er of sons , god has done something, he's sent his son Jesus Christ into this world in fact his done the greatest thing he could do, he has done the very ultimate thing, he has sent his son into the world that's the greatest intervention god could ever have made, it was far greater than, than just intervening in sm , in some small local event, were you see some catastrophe happening and you say well why doesn't god do something there, or there's a war situation going on in some other part of the world, well why doesn't god step in and stop it, god has stepped in, not in a local situation, not in some er passing problem or need but he's stepped into the greatest way possible by sending his son Jesus Christ into the world to dye for men and woman, to take away sin, to pay the price that god's righteousness demands for sin so god has intervened and his intervention has changed the whole situation, its brought a whole new complexion on things, its changed the colour completely, no longer is the world now under darkness and in, and in pending judgment in doom, because Jesus Christ came and he took that judgment and that, that condemnation upon himself, he said I've not come to condemn the world he said its already condemned, its already under judgement, the sword of Damocles is already hanging over the world and Jesus Christ came in and to take that judgment and that condemnation on himself and when he died there on the cross and rose again, there came that burst of light in a world that had been shrouded in blackness and darkness, a world that had been shrouded in sin suddenly for the first time sees the light, god has paid for himself the price of sin, god has intervened and changed the whole situation and the message of the gospel is that if you and I allow that intervention to effect us personally, then like those four men surely we too are amazed at what we've found. If we've come to guard and received forgiveness of sins, if we have become good followers of Jesus Christ and we are not amazed then there's something wrong with what we've received that god should so love, not just the world, but should so love me, that he gave his son to die for me and that was the sort of er discovery that these four lepers made they've come down there, they've found that the sight before them was amazing, there was no enemy there, the enemy had disappeared and the tents with all their contents were there before them, they were amazed with what they found and you and I when we come to god through Jesus Christ, we are amazed at what we find, we find forgiveness, we find the restoration of a relationship between ourselves and god, we find an access to receive god's blessing to receive his favour, to receive his gifts that he has for us, no wonder the apostle Paul cries out thanks beyond to god for his unspeakable gift, but then again these four men they were not just amazed that what they found, they were, they got absorbed in what they got, because they got a lot more than they bargained for, they possibly in their wildest dreams thought they might at least get, get what the cook was throwing out, they might get to, to the dustbins, they might get what was left over, that would of been great, they were dying of starvation, the driest mouldiest crust would of been like, like a banquet to them, but they got so much more than they anticipated and they got absorbed in it, every thing was there's for the taking as they pulled back the, the flap of the tent as they go in and they see the tables laid out there, they see the food and the drink, they see the plenty, these men who for weeks have known terrible poverty, there might of been a time earlier on in the siege when a few scraps got thrown over the city wall, when the bins were put out the side of the city of an evening, er they would go there and forage amongst them, but all that had stopped long since and it was only the bits and pieces that they managed to forage for themselves and get for themselves that they'd been eating of late, but here every thing is there for the taking, they rubbed their eyes, they pinched one another to make sure their not dreaming, it really is food and drink in a, in an abundance they couldn't of thought of a few mo hours earlier one moment they had nothing, the next they've got every thing, what was it they needed, food, the tables would of been laden with it, it was the food, enough food for an army and there's only four of them, did they, were they thirsty, here was drink, here was wine and, and drink in abundance the rags, the tatters they were dressed in, there were garments and wardrobe full of clothes here for them, did they need money, well the tents were full of the gold and the silver and, and, and valuables, there were a sufficiency, every thing was there you know the idea that the Christian life is drab and poor is such a terrible false hood, its an iniquitous lie of the devil, the tragedy is that we have actually often made it that way, we have made the Christian faith something drab, something boring, something for old folk er and er you know, people who are, who are, just wanting a crutch because their coming to the end of their natural life and we've made it something drab and dull listen to what the apostle Paul says when he's writing to Carinthian's in his second letter in chapter eight, he says you know the grace of our lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might be rich, god, he's purpose follows his people, he's not that we've a drab, grey, dull uninteresting life, Jesus said I've come that you might of life, and that more abundant, that in all its fullness and god has purpose for us, and when Paul is talking about riches there, he's not talking about pounds and pence, he's talking about the richness of the life that we enjoy its not a case of not doing this and having to do that the other thing, its a case of enjoying life as god purposes it, as god intends it you know if you don't enjoy your Christian life now, let me tell you your in for a rude awakening when you get to heaven, because the quality of life is not gonna change the only things that'll change is its la it, it will, it will be in his presence, the quality of life will not change because already now we have received eternal life, he has given his life to us and he hasn't got some other special, you know, super duper life laid up, there's nothing, there's nothing greater ahead, god hasn't got any thing greater for us than what he's already given to us in embryonic form here and now why if we take on er a, a, a dazzling scintillating new zest and zap when you get to heaven, that life is already given to you and to me know go back to these four men at the moment, they had never known any thing like this before this was better than all their birthdays rolled into one, this was the greatest day in their experience and if they would live to be a hundred they would never know another day like this, they were having a tremendous time, it said they, they, they, they went into one tent, listen to what they did, they went into one tent and they, they ate, they drank, they had a party and they carried from there the silver, the gold and the clothes and they went and hid they returned and entered another tent and then they did the same there, they were having a tremendous time, this was a beano to end all beano's, this was the greatest day in their life, they were having a wonderful time and why shouldn't they, why not you know there are folk who would, who'd want to make us as Christians er and er, ee, put us into a straight jacket the bible tells me even the sunsets free, is free indeed and I don't see any suggestions as I read the New Testament, that first of all the life of Jesus was drab and uninteresting, or that he expects me as his follow to lead a drab, a grey life, oh its not always gonna be a ple an easy life but that doesn't reduce the, the zest and the excitement in it but you see the danger is when having a good time is the reason for living and the only reason for it, you see, if god has intervened in our life, if the message of the gospel is true, if god in Christ has taken away your sin and made you in Christ a new creation then you have every reason to enjoy life, in a sense your only able to start enjoying life now, you may have enjoyed some of the things that, that folks suggest that make up life, but they've finished, there gone, what happens when the, when, when the wine has run out, what happens when the parties over, you know all about it the next day, don't you, what happens then, its such short lived, its only worth having whilst its coming to you all the time, but that's not so with a Christian life, because it doe , depend on just the things that we have or the experiences that we go through, because it is something that, that we have within, it is, it is a quality of life that we possess, because we possess the one who is life himself, listen to what Paul says when he's writing to Timothy in his first letter in chapter six it is command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant or to put their hope in wealth, those who think that, that er in having possessions that is the secret of life or, or in having a good time and, and, and the rest of it that is what life is all about, he said warn them not to do that, because that is so uncertain, he says but to put their hope in god who richly provides us with every thing what for, for our enjoyment, why has god given us these things, why is, why is god even, he is natural creation there for us, it is for our enjoyment, its not to make us miserable or to make us grey and drab and burden by it, it is for us to enjoy, when god created Ada Adam and Eve and put them in the garden, the, they were told to enjoy it, even the fruit enjoy it, its there for your benefit and then the new creation, every thing that god has provided is there for our enjoyment, but the dangers is when that enjoyment, is the reason for living and that's all we do it for and were so taking up with ourselves, I am gonna have my good time, I'm gonna enjoy myself as a Christian and I can do it and you can do it, you become insular and we become introverted and the only thing that matters is me having a good time, my world centres around me and me enjoying myself and me having this and me having that, this blessing and that gift and that other blessing, we become self centred and taken up with our own good times, as long as I can be there in the centre, as long as I can go from, from, from this celebration to that celebration, as long as I can go from this er festival to that festival to this special meeting to that one, I'm gonna have my good time well that was what these fella's were doing, they were going from tent to tent, from celebration to celebration having a great time and then the truth hit them they were ashamed with what they had done, they said to one another we are not doing right, this days a day of good news, but we are keeping silent, if we wait until morning light punishment will overtake us, now therefore, come, let us go and tell the kings household how guilty are we, how guilty are you, how guilty am I of the sinner silence, remember how we started, its not always the things that we do its often the things that we don't do, how guilty are we of the sin of silence these men had known nothing, known poverty and, and, and, and starvation, they were amazed at what they'd found, they'd became absorbed in what they had got and now they'd became ashamed of what they had done with it what was the sin that troubled these men they said we are keeping silent. Back in the city there were thousand of people doomed, dying and all unnecessarily because here was plenty, here was sufficient for the whole city and possibly the greatest sin that you and I can be guilty of and that the church is generally guilty of, but you know when we talk about the church generally its, its so easy because that's general, you and I that are the church, not the denomination, not the organization, it you and I, possibly the greatest sin that we can be guilty of is the sin of silence, I'm not talking now about a rude, belligerent, discourteous, butting hole, button holding of people, I'm not talking about that, I don't see any place in gods word for that sort of attitude or that sort of approach but are we still silent, what about with those with whom we have the right, because we've created a relationship, because they know us and they've seen us and they've seen the experiences we've gone through and they've seen what god has done in our lives, what about with those people do we wait for others to do it, shifting the responsibility. thinking in, in, in the context of our, of our mission, this town wide mission, well that's Billy's job, he's better at it than I am, but its not his job, its my job as much as its his and its your job as much as its mine, we do not well to keep silent these men they were troubled by their sin of silence, perhaps you and I should be troubled by our sin of silence because the extension of that, and here's the really great thing, as far as they were concerned, the ex the, the ongoing because they were troubled by their sin of silence and they did something about it, they were thrilled at the sight that they saw, as they see the city being delivered, and as they see starving men and women eating food perhaps for the first time in days or weeks, buying good wholesome food at a reasonable price, that was the sigh that thrilled them and you can imagine them, and I think they'd be entitled to a little bit of pride that I'm glad we told them, I'm glad we went back and shared the news apart from any thing we couldn't of coped with all ourselves, it would of been so wrong to of kept it, it would of been so wrong just to of eaten it ourselves, I'm glad we went back and told them. Jesus said just before he was living his disciples, his followers, you and me, he said you shall receive power after the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me yes we witness by our life but there's a danger in making that a cop out, because one other requirement of a witness is that they talk, they've gotta say what they know, these four men were good witnesses, they went back and they told the city what they had found, and there's placed upon you and me that responsibility to go back and to tell what we've found, this is a day of good tidings, we do wrong to keep silent. what she's going to do. Right. Erm I'm here as a representative of a small company from York, called and what we're doing is we're working on behalf of the Group, who compile and publish the English Dictionary. And what I'm doing here today is, I'm recording this seminar as an instance of spoken English in the nineteen nineties. Which will go towards making a corpus of information from which will draw the meaning and usage of words as it was in the nineteen nineties. And this information will be linguistically analyzed, and then used to help compile the new dictionary which will be coming out in a few years. So I thank you all very much for taking part in this, and I hope you have a happy seminar. The people at the back may not be picked up on this so erm He should be here any minute. Right. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Morning. Sorry for coming in under the wire at er nine fourteen according to this clock. Erm Hugh's asked me to open this morning's erm quality seminar. Erm a a you're in for quite a good day. I know that er the seminar which I attended sparked off quite a lot of lively er debate. And er at the end of it I think we all felt we knew where we were going, and, and what the work that we'd put in over the last three years on the management procedures, which form the foundations of our quality system. Er I think we came to realize what that work was all in aid of. The management team had, I'll sit down if you don't mind, the management team has decided that we were going to go for quality because it was a matter of survival. The industry which we are part of is in excuse me, is in er sorry about this I've dashed across here I I'll read from Hugh's notes if you don't mind. Erm I would like to remind you of my objectives quoted at the time in th in the quality manual. Er to adopt best practices, er from the various offices, to help produce a better end product. To delegate decision making down as far as possible. And as far as our group's vision statement is concerned, to be acknowledged as the leading consultant in the rail er in the field of railway engineering. To provide a professional service satisfact I'm sorry Dennis, would you just excuse me? Can I hand over to you? I I I do apologize. Right. Sorry about that. Sorry I'm totally unprepared for this. Erm To start at the top and unfortunately I'll reread Hughie's notes. Perhaps wavering slightly. Erm It's now thr nearly three years since management procedures were introduced as the first stage of our aspirations to become quality assured. And I would like to you, remind you of my objectives quoted at that time and as are stated in the er manual. That is firstly to adopt best practice from various offices, which hopefully would help us to provide a better end product. And to delegate decision making er to as low a level as possible within the organization, compatible with safeguarding er the quality of the product that we provide to our clients. The group as you are aware do have a vision statement, erm which has been published er and it was er developed a couple of years ago er great effort by the er management team. And that vision statement is, to be acknowledged as the leading consultant in the railway i in the fields of railway engineering. To provide a professional service satisfying our clients' needs and exceeding their expectations. To be a well trained, dedicated and highly motivated team and to be committed totally to safety. Now that vision has not changed. That is still the group's er vision and stated objectives. Erm as far as certification of er th the of a system is concerned er we are still comm committed to getting office certificated and as many of you may be aware the Swindon office has actually overtaken us on the B E S side erm and they are er, but hopefully we will achieve certification for the whole of our group erm prior to Swindon achieving certification for their whole group. The subtle difference is tha that Swindon are going function by function and getting er five certificates. Er ours is a slightly more difficult task, I would suggest a much more difficult task, in that we're trying to go for one certificate for the whole of the group. Erm we believe, er if we are to demonstrate to our clients that we are as good or better than our competitives competitors, then we need certification. And this is seen as a matter of survival. Er fairly recently we were asked to tender for erm a new station at Rickmansworth for Crossrail and one of the prerequisites of that job, er which was a ten million pound project, er one of the prerequisites of that job, was that we should either be certificated or at least have a quality assurance erm system in place. And because er we do have a quality assurance system in place although not certificated, er we were able to tender for that work. Otherwise we would have not been able to tender. Erm I think I'll leave this up till . The basic message of quality, which Mike will er explain later on is, if you improve quality your costs decrease. Because you are continually reducing the number of mistakes that you make and continually improv improving. Erm and therefore you produce less wasted time, less remedial work er and a cheaper product. Erm quality could be regarded as an empty word. We need to bring it about, and it can only be done through teamwork. That's the point that Hughie has set as one of his objectives for the next twelve months, is to get the group acting as one team, and not five or six separate teams. Erm this is going to be extremely difficult because the British culture is one of every man for himself. People tend not to work particularly well in teams in this country. Erm but it's something that we need to work at. And th the Japs actually score in this because they actually believe totally in teamwork. Erm we need to change our culture. Erm I think really I'll just leave it there cos I'm a bit struggling, struggling a little bit to remember quite what Hughie was saying. If you appreciate I was actually thrown into the very deep end. I think perhaps what's going to be said to you to the rest of the day erm will actually bring out the key points tha that Hughie was trying, trying to make. One was that quality is here. Quality is here to stay. Quality is improvement. And the other aspect is one of working as a team. I think those were the two main messages that Hughie wished to get across today, and that we will concentrate on er during the rest of this seminar. Erm th that the seminar is going to be lead by Mike . Er Mike is from Associates and Mike has been helping the, the Q A team on a part time basis, and putting some sensible thought into how the group should go forward. Erm but before Mike comes on I would just like er Norman to make a few comments er on his commitment to the group's er quality system. Morning. Er quality. Definition of quality, right product at the right time, at the right price. Now in P Way Design we have no problems with that, do we? Or do we? Erm we are the most profitable part of the S A U. No problems about that. Er we've no great problems with our technical results, and where they are we sort them out quite amicably with the area people. We meet our main deadlines, which are normally the key deadline normally the S and C. We meet it don't we? So there's no problem. Or is there? Just looking at it in a bit more detail. We're profitable but we normally don't compete with anyone else for getting the work. So effectively we put in what is a fair price, and we get the job, and we do it normally within the price or within a slight overspend. But where we have competed, accidentally in one case, deliberately in another, we've been undercut by our rivals and we haven't got the job. Also a good pointer where we've been able to compare ourselves with civil engineering scaled fees, which was on the Overtown Bank Slip which was a job which went completely right, perfect no problems. If we'd have put in a price based on A C scaled fees, we would have overspent by a hundred and fifty five percent. So we thought. So perhaps there's a, a little bit of work we can do in er in that sphere. The right time. How many times have I had someone come and say, can you sign this drawing please it has to go, go to John tonight. He's taking it for the meeting tomorrow. Er how many times have we said, yeah, we can do this job but we'll, it needs the route improvement that we're doing for Arthur . Or er , Arthur's in no hurry. Well Arthur is a very reasonable and good friends with us. But he notices, it builds up, he starts thinking to himself, they're always late. It's no great problem but I'm not getting it on time. Yet he begins to notice if we do it . Think about our finished product. I said you know the minor er faults and discrepancies, we er tidy up quite amicably with the area people normally. But what we've got to bear in mind is that minor faults in our design can be very serious when translated to a job on the ground which . Also the person who has helped us sort out maybe come to sensible engineering conclusion on the minor problem, but be saying to his chief, there was a problem with the York though I just managed to sort it out. And that builds up. Also what you've got to bear in mind is that inherent in any permanent way job is the capacity for something to go wrong. And when something goes wrong there's recriminations and when there's recriminations, people will crawl for ways out. That is the time for there to be nothing wrong with our drawings. Drawings can be blamed when er there is actually nothing wrong and people are looking for an excuse blame from themselves. So again for reasons like that, we have to maintain the confidence of the client. And that today is what it's all about. If the client is confident that he's getting the best deal from us, he will say, alright Birmingham ar are cheaper than York on a route improvement say, but I've had one of their cheap jobs before. I'll, I'll stick with York and get value for money. Erm drawing the client, is he has confidence in us say, well York have got their act together. If the S if the S and if the S and T give them a, a fair crack of the whip. There's no problems with York, they always given me a good service in the past. And the er technical quality of our drawings the client if he has confidence will say, who are you trying to kid? York drawings are good. just just yarning You're trying to d divert attention erm erm disturb discrepancies. So it's a question of us retaining, because to a certain extent we already have it, due to our customer past. Retaining and renewing customer confidence. And this is where B S five seven fiv five O certification or I S O Nine Thousand and one certification is important to us. As Dennis has said from er Hughie's erm erm er statement, it is a requirement nowadays. And it's valuable to us in, in three aspects. First of all,certification is a bedrock of achievement, like having a degree, and you need a degree or an H N C or an O N C. It's a statement in itself. More importantly, it's er conveys to the client that we care about quality, that we've gone to the trouble to set up procedures which make our product as good as it possibly can be. And thirdly, it has a very real er value in that, in going for er certification, we are actually putting checks and procedures in place which will help to ensure that what we do is the right price, is to the right time and is the right product. So that's basically all er just one after thought, Dennis mentioned teamwork, now we we've been together for a few years basically, but you might say, we work as a team, everyone gets on, everyone helps each other out. We do within P Way Design, which is probably the best office I've ever worked in for that. But what we've got to bear in mind is that we are a multi-functional group. There's PICAS involved, works office involved, to a lesser extent B E S. So that is really where a weakness is, it's in perceiving the needs of other parts, parts of the group. That's something that we do have to work on and I can't emphasize it too strongly. Okay. Er I've said a lot so I'll er leave you to Mike to take things further. Thank you very very much Norman that's great. Have you all got a programme in the folder? So that you've got a vague idea of er what's going to befall you for the rest of today? Okay? We'd very much like you to feel free to ask any questions or comment er er on, on the er presentations during the course of the morning. Er and this afternoon. So don't hesitate to ask questions or, or discuss points which you feel erm have not be made very clearly or perhaps with which you don't even agree. And let's try and resolve any issues which, which come up like that. What we want to do this morning is erm tt talk a little bit to you about er the quality system and the I S O Nine Thousand procedures and er documented er systems, which have been developed so far within the whole group. Er and we want to try and explain a little bit about tt how far we got in terms of achieving certification to I S O Nine Thousand. But we then want to er explain w what this business of quality planning is all about. Because we believe very very strongly wi that with an organization like yours, where each piece of work that you do is slightly different from other pieces of work, to have er a single m way, an approach to following the work er is, is really not, not the right er thing to do at all. What we're looking for is a quality system and a set of procedures which are flexible enough to enable you to handle the slick jobs, which you haven't got a lot of fee income for. And we want you to able to handle the, the complex jobs which require an awful lot of checking and a a a lot of er a lot er detail because the fee for the job is i is, is higher, and the job complexity is high. Er and we we want to be able to have a mechanism within our I S O Nine Thousand system, which enables us to tackle different jobs of different, different complexity. So that's er essentially this, this morning's er er programme, and the objectives which we want to try and er look at and achieve. First and foremost though, we want to go back to basics and erm get our ideas absolutely straight as regards what quality is and what we're trying to achieve with I S O Nine Thousand. There's a lot of misunderstanding about I S O Nine Thousand and I think that Norman's er analogy a few seconds ago is really, really rather good. If you're asking a civil engineer to do some work for you i if that civil engineer has a degree does it automatically mean that the work's going to be perfect and wonderful? No. It doesn't does it? Erm but there are certain civil engineering activities which e I'm thinking perhaps more about the bridge design side of things really, but there are certain activities which actually demand a certain level of qualification before you, you can actually sign, sign off drawings or a or agree to calculations or whatever. Yes? So the fact that you've got a degree or an H N C, or whatever, is actually a starting point. It it's, it's er a, a level from which you y you er you progress and it's the same with I S O Nine Thousand or five seven five O. It's really no guarantee of perfection, but it's, it's a sort of measure. It is a level, a starting point and perhaps er we'll, we'll pursue this concept during the next er hour or so. Let's, let's look at what quality is in basic terms. We've got somebody from the Oxford English er dictionary compilation er arena, with us today and I, I, I'm almost tempted to ask Clare what wh what, what the definition of the word quality is actually . But do you know what the, what a typical dictionary would give as the definition of quality? We s it's a word we use quite a lot. Wh wh what's, what's the definition of the word? I told you they'd be quiet to start with. Any ideas? What do we mean when we use the word quality in normal day to day language? We use the word often enough don't we? Any ideas? We've got all day, yes. We started early. Come on. Perfect. Excellent. Above average. Excellent. Perfect. Above average. This is great, yes. Any more ideas? The Oxford Dictionary tempers the word excellence, or perfection, with erm a piece of phraseology, degree of. Erm now what's the problem with this definition? If you ask two people to go away and do the same job with a degree of excellence, are you to get the same result at the end of the day? From the two different people? It's not really a very clear definition is it? From a work point of view, degree of excellence, it's, it's too vague. So unfortunately, we're not able to manage quality if we use the dictionary definition of degree of excellence. We need to have something better, or something different. So this is the first problem where w we, we talk about the management of quality. We have to change the definition of the word that we've grown up with over the years, otherwise we really can't manage the concept. And this is where all our problems start. It would have been nice actually if somebody had said, we're not going to have quality management, we're going to have uck management. Or something like that, then we could have of, we could have redefined this, this new word and we wouldn't have had these awful confusions that we get. But what we have to do is completely junk the definition of the word quality that we've grown up with over the years. But we still use the wretched word. So where do we go? Well I think that a number of you might have seen that definition of quality. Have you come across fitness for purpose? One o one or two nods. Thirteen blank looks. Four co one or two people completely disinterested. That's not, that's fair average really isn't it I think . Now this definition, fitness for purpose, erm fits in very nicely with I S O Nine Thousand and the requirements in, in the quality systems standard. Er it's a little bit vague, is fitness for purpose, but it fits in with I S O Nine Thousand quite well because of the con of another little concept. We're talking about concepts rather a lot this morning. How do we find out what the purpose is? If we're going to do er a job? Right. Where do get the specification from? The client. Yeah. The hint behind this phrase is that it wouldn't be a bad idea to talk to the customer, talk to the client. Erm I know this is a bit of shock horror to some of you. I mean the client what do they know about anything? Might as well go and talk to the doorpost as some of your clients, mightn't you? But the theory is that if we, if we get to know what the, the purpose er o o of the job or, or the assignment is, er then we, we stand a slightly better chance of er getting a satisfied client at the end of the day. However, it's still a vague definition and we often find it more useful to er tidy that definition up by introducing, conformance with requirements. So having, having found what the er the purpose of the exercise is, what, what the job is, that we're trying to do, we need to beef up the detail a a and start to define requirements. Now actually this is a very very good definition of the word quality. It's a very good definition, but what are the potential problems with that definition? Requirements have changed. W we've got a problem I think with the word, word requirements, er in several senses and Al Alastair you're absolutely right on that. Er it's a bit like shifting sands at times, isn't it ? And you know very well that as soon as you start to launch yourself into the world of contracting by, by its very nature a contract a a automatically has loopholes in it , and the more you write in a contract the more loopholes you've got. Therefore it's actually quite difficult to define really really accurately requirements. Let me give you another, another example, if you're going to ask people to clean a railway carriage what do you mean by clean? Do you mean inside or outside? Say inside. What do we mean by clean? Well if you're going to ask some poor devil to clean er a carriage out isn't it fair to tell them what it is you mean by clean? What result you want at the end of the day? But what do we do in practice? We just say here's a bucket. Here's a mop. You know, you know what clean is. Get on with that. Well that's not fair is it? Really? On the individual? Because it means you can always criticize the individual, for either not having done the job well enough or for having not done it quite the way you thought it ought to be done. I think that's a good example of where defining requirements is, is quite difficult. And where defining requirements is difficult what tends to happen is that we don't bother. Now this is where I think the Japanese score dramatically, they spend many many hours defining things which we say it's not worth the effort to define. And if we put a little bit more effort into specifying requirements more tightly, then there'd be less argument at the end of the day as to whether we've done a good job or a bad job. And I S O Nine Thousand and quality management is very much about trying because it is, it is hard work and we can't necessarily succeed i i in every situation. But it's about trying to define requirements to the, to the best erm level and best degree. And then setting out our way of operating to, to meet the specifications and requirements that we've set for ourselves. And the fitness for purpose at the back of all this, indicates that it's not a bad idea to talk to the client. Because if you define requirements in an ivory tower and you don't talk to the client, you're gonna produce something which isn't exactly what they necessarily want. Now somebody very very er cleverly brought up the word client perception and in fact we h were given the definition earlier from Hughie's notes, of meeting and exceeding customer expectations. But if we are going to meet expectations of clients then really we have to know exactly what it is the client needs and would be happy with. And we have to specify internally to us what will meet the client needs and even just exceed the client needs. And that is what we have to do within the time and organization constraints which Norman er correctly mentioned earlier . And the whole business of managing the time, the resources and the, meeting the specifications is, is very much a matter which quality management addresses. Now as we go on I'd just like to bring in another er thought for you is that view-graph correct? There is no high or low quality. Is that correct? Geoff's giving us a really really positive nod over there and a lot of very very suspicious people round the table, Geoff who don't agree with you I think. What do you think? Do you agree? I would think that in the terms that you want to define it in, that statement's true but I wouldn't necessarily agree with it. Right. Sorry to be awkward. No. No. This, this is, that's, that's really great. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. But you see what we've got here is this problem of the old definition of quality, still lurking there in the mind, quality is a degree of excellence, therefore you have high quality and low quality. But if we, if we junk that definition, and then go I put, I try and I will try things, and most, and most adventurous things are spicy Are spicy yeah don't like spicy, I wish I could be like that, but it don't like I mean I'm the opposite to you. Yeah, I can't Yeah, I was like that, curries, Boring yeah What did they Jeanie moaning, Lily weeing, she's got a water infection so she's been about to the loo about five thousand times Oh bloody hell Lisa's friend burst into tears in Oh she's got problems she's split up with her boyfriend, Oh dear. She's also got a little debt behind Tony hasn't been paying the bills. oh gawd. she's been contributing that's one reason one , she's, discovered other things, this morning somebody turned up apparently they took a loan out He's not paying it apparently turned up this morning and they want a hundred pound by tomorrow, and they're coming back tomorrow for it paying him ten pound a week and thought it was gone and he had er none so find a hundred pound by tomorrow and she didn't know where she was going to get it from, she just stood there and burst into tears and run off going on Yeah, that is not good. but she saw him on the way to work in town, had a bloody great barney with him on the market place on the way to work, just say, she was in there about ten minutes and burst into tears Not very good He said twenty in that, I said yeah I've already done it, so I've dished it up and then out comes the . When I, I didn't put any extra on mine and I don't thought oh did tell you I put some in it , he said but yeah but you don't normally put much in it he Oh I love it, and I've barred it from the house. he's barred it from the house. I said, I said I'm not having that here If I buy it I have to wrap it up so because it , I said that it's I said you ain't having that in cooked it. You, I didn't cook it, I bought it, it was already done . Well what you you eat it and it's dear,, we do, we do tons and tons of it every day I love it . You wouldn't if you, you wouldn't if you had to deal with it all day long when we down to London last week, we went in to see a friend of ours, she works in the sandwich bar and erm, he said oh we'll have something to eat so I said to Chris they had this great big bowl of chicken tikka, ooh It's very expensive . want that bit he won't talk to me if I had that. Ever so expensive Ooh lovely Yeah it is, I mean the first time I bought it Its two pound thirty five for six bits yeah or er, half a pound er yeah, that, that's how I bought it in Sainsburys a few years ago About six, seven pieces How much is it? Two pound thirty five,half pound Half a pound? Yeah there's a lot goes in apart from the chicken there's a heck of lot goes in it in the Put cream and the expensive bits, not like the chicken and the time it takes Oh yeah. Yeah, but that Yeah So does Stuey and so does Bob, don't you Bob? It's tandoori that he likes. It is that tandoori, he loves that I don't like any of them and then when you've seen them all day long it puts you off a bit don't like none of the I like chicken cos I like that. Can't get hold of them. Its a shame innit? Used to get them a lot, but we haven't seen any for ages. Hello dearest Hello my darling All right then? Yep You Yep and what's the plan of attack today? Oh plan of attack erm down. I'll go and tell the estate agent you'll be a little bit late. Yeah. You go to the solicitor and then I'll see you on the wa , on that part of the shop It is a problem estate agents' name, look as though it Yeah, on the appointment you could get from the solicitor was Get those soon as poss, and I'll go and look in the carpet shop Yes find out a few details and I'll meet you back at the estate agents Oh or if you're out early, well forms sign, so you might be a little while and if you've got, oh we're going to mum's then aren't we? Said it's still very early, we could pop to Leveringham, oh we don't know where it is we might have some details in this, what we gotta do with my money. My house, my house, my I shouldn't think until you at least gone to the mortgage he's gonna give us authorization to spend his money. I'm not gonna use authori to go and spend one thousand, five hundred pounds and it all falls through That's true, that's true, that's true, after we've spent it very true, very true And what we having for lunch? Don't know, I don't know what we're having Taking fish to mum's or find something when we get there? You taking depends how old it will be don't it, don't know how old it will be. No No point in buying fish extra if we know we're gonna be, have to wait or something If we're gonna be late, we'll have to buy the fish, cos we won't have time to cook anything. Oh fish and chips you mean, from the chippie? Yeah, yes I'll just have a piece of fish and you can have fish and chips, we won't have time to cook anything will we? That's what I mean Depending on the time. or I say chicken alright? Depending on how long we're gonna have to cook it, well I mean,, oh well what I can still you'll have to fish and chips still you perhaps have to buy fish and chips Why? cos Ann hasn't got a lot of pennies anyway Nor has Stuey. hasn't he? Oh bloody hell, we're poor streaks then dear. That's wise you know. Bloody hell,then, it's chicken Right oh yeah well, we've got some erm cordon bleu or some whatever, you know, It can go in microwave. or whatever's Go in the microwave that's all, I ain't got much money at all, I didn't have that much left, I bought mum's cigs and that bit of shopping the other day and that was the end of that we will survive. Pay day late again? Even if we only have a tin of soup, that will do me. Yeah, I don't mind so it's pay day today Yeah but you can't get it till tomorrow there is a little bit in the bank, but not a lot, go wait till tomorrow and we must get to Chester Hill today . I like that, I don't like Jason Donovan but I quite like that, do you? Not bad I don't like him, I never have but I, try not,quite pleasant isn't it? Oh yes pleasant, oh yes pleasant. I've never liked anything else he's had,particularly have you? But I just find that pleasant listening. Oh it's a pleasant sound. Pleasant and nice songs I suppose I don't know it's just, quite like it, it's now big, it's about the most thing he's ever recorded that I have liked, Mm. I've absolutely never been a Jason Donovan fan before Christmas number one's going to be Bohemian Rhapsody which I do like you know I know, will do. yes, it's already going to the top of the charts to be number one for Christmas all the other Christmas songs are They're all coming down and that one's er yep going up that will do. They always prices keep falling. Well, I understand its reasoning , but, I think if you've been very hard pushed list, with this money, don't you? Mm, mm. Considering I'm not supposed to have that cos I had it when Ann and bought it not sure if it's now are you? Not really, was, though I thought we were offering a reasonable price taking everything into consideration upstairs and price market market erm, how long we've been here sitting tenants er I'm not thinking it object the sitting tenants the , I thought that was fair as it stands at the moment. fairly good deal. Mm. See here, they're gonna get thirty six for it as it stands put it on the market as Might do, yeah. Might even two years . When you look at, look at the old houses on the market, erm, yeah, I think he might just, he might wait a while, there aren't that many buyers, Oh that's it, that's why they're coming down, that's why are quite pleased to see us dear, especially at this time of the year, not many people will buy Christmas time, think oh we'll wait and go and get Christmas over and the spring and I think looking at the market you can, you can get a, erm detached, semi-detached sort of one you know one bedroom I suppose, You can get two bedroom two bedroom at a push for about thirty four, thirty five, thirty six, thirty seven, oh I don't know, I don't know, I think it will be a while getting rid of it yes, but I think he might get his price eventually, but it will take a long while to get it , it's up to him if he wants a quick sale,you know, thirty five yeah I, thirty five thousand I think , as I say taking everything into consideration, I mean, failing three okay I know I did the thirty three so take thirty five, thirty three and a half, oh he ain't got much to worry about Well I'd better get some clothies on cause a bit of a stir round the estate agents , naked from the waist down,darling What that's ten minutes slow Just a-f-bout done all your paper work on them teams I know. got a he's coming tomorrow you know, got the bird as well ain't we, that's why I got up early to I, go through deeply objective. Why, what's been it's completely anonymous number you know it's only to be on that, said I'll wipe it off then, you bloody well won't, I think he wants to tell people before he can say very wrong, could say something personal,if it was personal, no longer it, no you weren't personal to you, but I'm quite happy to arrange it if you wish, no, no, no, no, no,, I shouldn't have to tell you not to take my points in full, there we go it's driving me doing that in the factory having without people's permission, I want to know, I ask permission if I'd er wanted to as a without being asked to do it, I would of gone and seen personnel and asked, I would not of dreamed of doing it in a work's situation unless I was asked, say anything personal I'd turned it off not that it, apart from me and Stuart Go on. apart from me and Stuart there's nothing personal on it really, we went me and er telling me about her problems I only put that on a tape do you? , its not er you know, anything personal like that you turn it off don't you?not that they know or care whi anyone's personal problems anyway, they don't know who we are Cos a conversation like that very well be a private person will not be a but then again you, you might, you might come up and say, say something that that they wanna hear, you wanna hear? Yeah, but No, but you said you yeah that's what I mean the person have a private conversation and let someone say it to me and it, what they, problems it's not something that you wanna be on somebody else's to listen to is it? You just don't do it, you know its anonymous. Deirdre's the only person that's erm got one I on there Saw her car Well I thought I was gonna hit a tree I suppose I had better make a move to get some clothes on you think? Well you needn't bother. No won't go nowhere that I do Get a pair of scissors cut that out and stick it on these What do you think? Yes it will be good, I hope so, I'm getting nervous now. Well he don't usually turn up till twenty to and then we was there a little bit early as well Yeah Yeah,get some sticky tape, I know that, well they do twenty bit of table put a plant on it, stick it on the mm, mm, Cup of tea on the road, yes I'm a few minutes gonna get busier Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons, and evening and er It's house Sunday,out Christmas at least it will be a bit more that was the instead and you and I sleep on the settee. turf her out on the bed she might sleep with me and you sleep on the settee or would be a bit better than two beds than the settee, an extra bed space for her mum's house too much for over Christmas, that's not fair she's not all over the place . about moving, I chest some things, she won't be there, I'm not taking it all up there. No. She got I don't fancy that at all, sleeping in the to her garage looking my things, It 's all his stuff in the garage, that belongs to oh Oh. exactly, it don't sound very good does it? No Cor, he's low, bloody hell What have you lost? I can't find the car keys. Oh we won't go far without them. Took them back in I lock the door you lock them in?on your knee. I must of had them on my lap and normally put it straight to the ignition. And off we'd jolly well go. Broke my nail look at that. Oh dear you It looks horrid doesn't it? I caught it on a rack in the Nasty, nasty, nasty. It was hanging on so I had to take it off they are a bloody nuisance them racks you know, dangerous Are they? It's a wonder people haven't had serious injuries from them really. Yeah. Don't know we get away with it they want the whole lot bloody scrapping and the new lot all the rust ones, there's hardly one decent is there? No. Chucked all the duff ones out At least, yeah, I should think nine tenths of them would go, very there's yesterday's winner darling. Still trotting along . That's where all my horses go. I got ride on a horse, poor horse with me on it There's heavier people than me that ride , jump jockeys are nearly as heavy as me that ride. That's true true,not that No, she's that er she's not She's not fat but she's a big lady like me. She's same sort of weight as you? Yeah yeah, she's a big lady like me, solid. Tall isn't she? Yeah jockeys are eleven stone aren't they, er jump jockeys jump jockeys are All the weight and that are aren't they? Yeah,and going over jumps and god knows what else which one's quite a way really isn't it?it's quite comfortable eleven, eleven and a half, eleven stone over jumps innit? Ten stone's Is it? Ten stone is race, why I do they have weights do they jump jockeys, Some time you get a to carry ten stone, he's got seven pound from, so carries nine stone seven ten stones about twelve stone it certainly is a I think I quite enjoy a ride yeah . Did you like horses, you don't fancy getting on the back of one? No. Oh, thought you would. you are a large, but Yes, what I'm saying, yeah whatever cart horse Especially this one it does say, it will have to be a bloody great stallion wouldn't it?but er,I think it will be quite enjoyable. Wash the curtains today in the pub Oh god, I got a frog in me throat. Where you going to park? No, I can't understand why people who do, who work in town don't use that one really. Pardon. I doubt they do as well. Oh I don't know, cos there's a hell of a lot of people parking, same cars in that multi-storey in there. Let's have a look then. can if you want, in the it's not that far to go around and use one for the whole day. Pardon. I suppose. Yeah, that gets pretty full weekends but I don't like that one every week in The Standard there's always a, you know, this break in, that break in and When you park your car you've got the breaking in. I know, but that one seems worse than anywhere, isn't it, every week you know stolen out of the car park car broken into, I mean who's, I can't imagine with all them cars in there that nobody ever seems to see anything. No. Or they do, and turn a blind eye. Quite often that happens late at night, doesn't it, you know Yeah after chucking out time. I think a lot of people are just, you know, I'm not getting involved in them, they might belt me one, walk away, anyway you can't blame them, sad, people can't, people can't say it were you and your boy, you know, leave that, leave that alone or else I'll go and get a policeman, the fear of them Young belting them one. go and get a policeman, time you've gone and got a policeman they're off They're gone you know, so, there's no seen so much of it that it, that somebody will see some of it but then, well maybe there, and he didn't really erm, you know, you get out of it quick.

If you don't mind me asking. Your fish and chips. What, altogether? Yeah. Eh? Three quid. Well, Sheila brought some fish round here on Tuesday. Admittedly . And it was four pounds. Mm I know. The fish! I know. On its own! Well the last time I bought some then it was three pound something for me and you. Yeah. I mean I give Bruce the biggest bit you know Admittedly you get more don't you, for four pounds. Oh admittedly. But it was four pou it's three pound something a pound Ann. Yeah. That's what I paid. Cod. Just cod. I just had just over a pound Yeah,isn't that dear? of fish and it, it was three pound something. Isn't that dear? Mm. I mean admittedly you don't get that much fish in there do you? No, cos there's a lot of batter There's a lot of batter. round it. Mm. But that's what it cost, the fish itself, four pound. I know. It is expensive. Yeah. It used to be a cheap meal Ann. You see we moan about paying three pound a pound for meat but you pay it for fish. Yeah. It's no different really is it? Yeah. Yeah but I mean fish we we used to consider fish Oh it was cheap. as a cheap meal weren't it? Yeah. No wonder people don't buy it and now, you know I mean the fish sales have gone down. No wonder. meat's cheaper. Mm. I mean that was cod. What did we have last time? That wasn't nothing special. Just cod, ordinary cod. Whether we had haddock or something, didn't we? Yeah. Or plaice, was it? Well it it's not that much dearer now than the Plaice I think we had didn't we? Something like that I know Salmon's a bit salmon is Trout's the cheapest and Yeah. That's what I'm saying That that's ever so cheap, trout isn't it? You could get a nice It's only two pounds a That's right. You could get a nice pound of trout for Mm. two bits of trout for might as well get trout. Mm. Don't forget you're gonna get a lot of if you have a whole trout you've got skin and Oh yeah, but not that much. Not that much. You can eat the skin anyway. That's it. I like the skin. Mm I do. Only the head and the tail and the innards Yeah. and then the rest's all edible. Yeah. Do you want erm an apple crumble? Do you want Ann to go and whip you up an apple crumble? Not today. There's a bit of cake there. Bruce didn't have any cake. Is he alright? Yeah. Or is he a bit, still a bit Oh I don't know. Oh. I didn't ask. Try not to talk about it . Well he doesn't talk about it. I'm waiting for him. I told Sheila that. That was, that was li like that day wasn't it? When we were, that Sunday when we all sat here waiting for somebody to say something. Well Everyone waited for Stuart to start and he wouldn't . That's right. He wouldn't, he wouldn't start the conversation off. said to him, say something. No, let them say something and nobody said anything at all. We, they went in the end. some tea Ann? There's some skimmed milk there. Semi-skimmed I should say. Are you gonna get something for Sunday Stuart? Yo you know, your It's for the the gannets. I'll sort out the food. ? Well I don't know. What do you, what are you gonna get? It's up to you, pork? Pork would be alright. Cheapest isn't it? Mm. big bit of pork, what do you, what have we had lately? Don't want chicken. Pork or beef. Whatever you like. How about that? Mm? And some veg. If you don't come here first that's what I'm say I'm saying. Cos you might not come here first might you? There you are. There you are. Did you hear that? Is that a weakish tea? Thank you dear. I've got this organized now, I'm alright. Look, see? Oh yeah, that's nice. Be alright won't it? Do you think it will? Yeah it's a nice jumper. It's Big. Big isn't it? It is quite big, but then Too big for him Ann? Well, it don't matter does it? I'd rather have it too big than than skimpy on him. be lovely and warm. Oh it will be warm. You ain't kidding. Mm Eh? Lovely and warm won't it? Yeah. She begrudges you every little bit of that. It's mine. She does, doesn't she? Her head goes up and down every time you put a forkful in. Yes. I get fed up with her at tea time at night. Cos she, and then she gets f , she get's cross. I give her a clump, you know. And she starts to miaow eeeeeeeh. Little monkey she is. You know last night it was funny I watched the telly. I don't know what time it was. Thanks Ann. It was about eleven o'clock, you know? Time for bed. Thought well I had this fire on so, I gets up to go through and make myself a l you know a drink before going to bed and I put my 'jamas on and dressing gown. And she was on the beanbag. When I get up, go through to get, when I get back On your chair already . Thought you'd gone. Yeah. Yeah. She she she mistimed it last night. All gone puss, look. She she mistimed it last night Ann. She thought I had gone. Gone. But I hadn't. But she was on this chair so when I came back cos she, I sat over there. She looked at me. What you doing sitting over there? So that's Time you time you were in bed. So that, yeah. So that's where she spends the night. Sitting up she couldn't wait to get er, you know Ooh. I was getting a bit late so she she couldn't wait. Mhm. Aren't you crafty isn't she? Take your possibly manage? I've heard erm people saying, I think it was in America erm, as, as long as you both shall love instead of as long as you both shall live. Yes. If you get married in a registry office, which I did, you don't say an , in England, you don't say anything other than that you take this chap to be your husband, and you interpret that to be as you wish. So that's, entirely up to the pair of you. I think that these inflated ideas perhaps come with the old language of the church, and if you're going to do that well then, all hail to you and er presumably you mean it if you've gone there. There are people who come from from different cultures amongst this hundred who might want to say something about erm, wedding ceremonies. I got married twenty three years ago in China, well, we just invite er, invited er our friends, and er former school mates to ma , to my home and we didn't make any vow, er we just gave a banquet to the friends, and er, in China people now can get married in many ways and er some foreigners have come to China to get married in a traditional Chinese way, and they have to er, carry their bride in a sedan chair. And their bride has to wear er, all in red and er the bridegroo er groom has to wear a long costume with a red big flowers in front i aha and then they get married and there's erm band, the Chinese traditional band with drums and trumpets blowing all the time and er, all the guests have a very nice time. And in China, usually, erm wedding is an important event in the family and an , when I got married I think my parents-in-law wo erm felt erm more excited than my husband and I ! Well that's,tha I mean tha that's, a pretty interesting description of er of a different kind of wedding, which is another one er another Well optional variation that you might well I got married in want to choose? Yes? Bu I meet a erm, a different oh, tribe in Saherli but I got married in England with my, though we make , this, I'd say, this man to be my wife forever, but when I got home, back home in Ingeria you know, we did it in a, a different way. We have er, my parents sat down with a the group of the family there Mm. you know, there's no vow there, but all we do is join hands together, share blessings to both of us, and no vow, we never make any vow but they made a blessing for us. The marriage will be successful and this one it is . There. Well I'd,, I come from Lebanon and I get married in here and I said the vows but I didn't understand, at that time I wasn't speaking English so Oh! Oh! Oh yeah! That's one to remember, I didn't understand what I was saying! Yes? But in Lebanon we don't have vows, they have like kind of contract, and if the if they broke the contract it's the bride and groo , the groom have to pay that amount of money for the the bride, even if it was her fault. It happens in my country, when you break the marriage, I mean in my town, when you break th the marriage this sort of money will be paid wi then. Whe when you're to make Mm. a er, but want to, want to do a wedding you pay a certain er amount of money then, then when you break the wedding you refund the money to your husband. Yes, this is, this is, this er Who's picking up Laura's point which is that you get all the contractual arrangements er er done, but I mean it doesn't mean you can't have the ritual, be it dressed with, you know, er a long But red dress with my my complaint is that mostly pom-poms for the groom or it's, it's the pomp and circumstance and and the fluffy lace and everybody being really happy and I know people think about it, but it's not seen as that, it's seen as a a, a family society thing, it's not two people sitting Mm. down and saying right, we're gonna buy a house, we're gonna have kids, have we thought about how many kids we're gonna have? Have we thought about whether we want to have kids at all? Maybe those are the questions we should asking, rather than you know, do you take this man for your husband. Mhm. When you come from a big family, as I do, erm yo you can have any size of wedding as long as the right people are there, anybody gets excluded it's er to be horrendous! Mm. Starts with you know, I haven't been invited why I'm and if you've got a big family, you really have to do it properly and it, it's gonna cost! Well a variety of views and I think the only generalization I can make about weddings is that you can't generalize about weddings, some people think they're wonderful, some people are sceptical, people have done their own er variations on weddings. I haven't really asked you very many questions so I'll, I'll ask you a question which sets us up for a programme we might do in the next series, having discussed the wedding, next the honeymoon! Here's the question. Is a honeymoon a good way to start a marriage? Button one for yes, and button two for no. You don't have to have had one to be able to comment on this. And, seventy seven people say yes, and twenty three people say no, and aren't you fascinated to know why they voted that way? You'll have to watch the next series. From us, here, goodnight. helps me to sort of see how the lesson's going. Right. So that's maths is it. How do you feel about last week's? Erm it was good, I made a lot of progress in it. . Compared to usual. Yeah. Yeah. That that's how I felt, that you were getting into it, you were understanding how the bits tied together Yeah. and making sense of it. So you're feeling happier with it? Yeah a lot better. Okay. Erm what you done since last time? Erm I did that work you asked me to do. Great. Great. And did it make sense? Sort of yeah. I was a bit Okay. it it got away a bit you know and and This this is what I'm saying last time that if you'll work through it, understand it, Oh yeah I can do that, Yeah. but if you if you if that's all you do then in eve even a week's time but definitely in a few months' time it's just gone. You'll just have this vague memory that, Ooh I could do that once, now where d how do I get started? Yeah. How do I get into it? So you need the practice. Erm been tending to concentrate on specific things which you know stand a good chance of being on the paper, and even if they're not will help you with others. So how much of it did you understand? Erm Which bits were you happy with? the positive and the negative. Okay. Erm So from your table you could find out Yeah. there's a good chance that one of the positives will go with one of those negative Yeah. and you can make something out of it. Right. Now what what were the bits that were a bit tricky then? Erm just remembering say I had to put four O Hs with N H, I was sometimes I was getting it right sometimes I was getting it wrong and stuff like that . Right, so for the for the diagram It was just where I was putting the four I wasn't sure about. Yeah. The diagram was okay. What was physically happening you could relate to that and you got that sorted out. Now how do you put it down on paper? What's the notation? That Yeah. that's the only problem, okay? Yeah. So you're understanding it. You could explain that to me. Yeah. Yeah, you could say what it looked like and what was happening and then say, Well I'm not quite sure what the convention is for writing them Right. down. Well that's fine. I mean the convention is each of these ex I mean what you could have, you could put brackets round everything. . If you think of maths you can you can put brackets in where you don't need them can't you? Yeah. So you could put there. If I wanted to do something like three add six I could put brackets round the three and round the six and it wouldn't make any difference. Erm if I put two times brackets three add six it does make a difference. Mhm. Yeah? Mm. It makes a big difference. Well it's the same with this. If you put something like N H and then O H four well the convention is that when it's a suffix stuff a subscript and a suffix below the line there and just after it,it only applies to the last element. Yeah. Usually mean the last letter cos most of the elem well a lot of the le the elements have one letter. So that would just be four Hs and one O. Right. To make it mean that you've got four Os as well you put it in brackets. So with the maths it's like it's the difference between four times O H or just sort of O plus four H four O plus H. So anything that you've got four of put a bracket round it. Right. Erm if we had something like erm N H four and we had something with a valency of eight, say, which is impossible Yeah. but we had one with eight so we'd have we'd have the whole thing there twice. So how many Hs would you have in that weird thing? Er eight. Yeah. And how many Ns? One. No eight. Two. Two. So Yeah. anything inside your brackets multiplied by what you've got outside just the way you would have two times brackets three add six close brackets. Okay? Yeah. So it's the same same with this. It's just a slightly different convention but Mm. basically it is maths. It's telling us how many sets of different things we've got. Right. So let's have a look what we've got here. So got N A positive O H negative N H four positive and O H negative now what's going on here? You've got an alkali trying to react with an alkali. Is this is this what you're supposed to be doing? Well that's No wonder you had trouble. Is that what I wrote er right What that's what I wrote but what I said was, Each of the acids reacting with this starting Ah with hydrochloric Okay? One. These these are two these are two common alkalis . Alkalis. Okay there's N A O H which is what? Er sodium hydroxide. Okay. And N H four O H which is? Nitrogen hydroxide no no er Have a look in the tables what N H four is. N H four ammoni Ammonium. ammonium. Okay. N H three on its own ammonia when it's combined with something else it's N H four ion and it's ammonium. Like erm chlorine on its own chlorine combine it with sodium it becomes a chloride. Right. So let's have a look at that now. You shouldn't have any problem with so you've tried there with which acid do you want to use? Hydrochloric's probably the simplest so have a go with that first because then you can see the pattern. Er hydrochloric acid is erm erm no erm ? It's got Erm hydrochloric what does that sound like? Hydrogen and chlorine. Okay. H C L that was it yeah Right I couldn't remember. Okay great. So it's H C L and C L's got a valency of one so that's nicely balanced one C L with one H plus. Erm now you've done that quite a few times before N A O so do the N A O H first and you should be able to whiz through that. Yes. erm So then you can work out which are positive and which are Right. Hydrogen's the one we tend to treat as a a metal. Yeah. Hydrogen is positive. Right. Chlorine is a negative. Er Sodium is a positive. Hydroxide is You've got one here there are some on this Yeah er negative. Right Yeah. So So most of these are one positive and one negative. So the hydrogen with go with hydroxide. Okay making? Erm so that's H two O plus this two H dow there. Yeah where does the two go? Down there. Right. Okay. Two goes down there so it's two what two whatever letter came before it. Yeah. Two Hs and one O. And on the C L we add the so yeah we get sodium C L is a negative N A is is a positive how many that's spare one spare Okay. transfer that's N A C L. Yeah that's it. That's H two O and S O you write the equation out for that now? That's N A C L Erm the sort of Erm. from what you start with from what it gives. From the hydrochloric acid and the Oh right. H C L plus N A O H is equal to N A C L Right yeah. plus H two O. Right great. So what's the sort of general term for this, this is an Hydrogen chloride. Yeah er what about this then? Sodium hydroxide. And it's an example of what? An alkali. Okay this is? Er acid. So you can just write under it acid plus acid plus gives equals N A C L is a alkali. Erm No it's not it's a salt. Good it's a salt. And you know what and water. Right and that's a general reaction that happens with virtually any acid and any alkali acid and any alkali salt and water. Er so have another go now at a similar sort of reaction. Same acid this time use a different alkali. Use ammonium hydroxide. Which is ammonium N H four usually put the acid first Right the acid and what acid gonna use? So use the same one. So H C L plus ammonium hydroxide that's N H Now it's got four spare ones and the hydroxide has got Er whoa whoa whoa now it's N H four right Yeah. so put the put the four on for N H four. Now if you look it up on the table let's have a look at erm say calcium double positive. Right zinc double positive this this type of ion Triple positive. is a triple positive. But N H four so it's a single positive. Oh right. Okay? Yeah. So It's four hydrogen with the Four hydrogen one nitrogen all their bonds got get together and there's one the result is one positive bond left over. Right. Okay you're not too bothered about what's going on internally So it's N H four O H So N H four O H because it's it's just one positive on that whole N H four cluster and we we think of that as an entity. That's a positive that's a negative er that's a positive that's a negative. Mhm. So the positive the negative Yeah that's good. and the negative the positive. That's it tha I like the way you did it because that's a good one to do first the H positive and the O H negative are going to give you the water. Now what are you left over with? it's a nice nice that for working it through. So that put the equals underneath so H so the chlorine and the N H four chlorine has got one spare one Right. and so's N H four so it's N H four C L. Right. Small L's don't forget. Oh yeah. Plus Okay so just write the equation out again. No need to write acid plus alkali Okay. Now try do you remember the formula for sulphuric acid? Sulphuric acid erm Yeah I will do now. Okay or nitric if that's easier whichever one Yeah. comes first. Erm N A O H no that's sodium hydroxide The ones ending in O H Yeah. are the alkalis Yeah. Okay. The acids all start with I know it it's just that with an H Yeah. well you know we put the H first. H two S O four. Brilliant. Okay? Yeah. So H two S O four right before we go any further with that H two S O four how many Hs in it? Two. And how many Ss? One. Good. One S. If we'd put brackets round Four Os. the whole lot and then a four down there it would have been four but four Os only one S. Right. Okay. Plus erm plus you could do ammonium erm now let's have a calcium erm hydroxide. Calcium that's C A two plus C A and that's a double positive Right so so I'm gonna need two hydroxide. Two hydroxides cos they're just a single negative. Which is O H. O H now how many of those do you want? In brackets. Great. And there are two. Right right. you got the the O H is the bit you want twice so write it down put the brackets round it and then the two. Right. Hydrogen is positive. Right. So that's positive. The sulphur sulphoxide Sulphate. sulphate is a double negative. Yeah sulphoxide was a good sort of And then I'm I'm a bit Any of the 'ates any of the 'ates have got oxygen in Yeah. in as well. So nitrate has got nitrogen and oxygen in it. The calcium is a double positive. And the O H is a that'll be a double negative cos there's two of them No Well now no no no no cos they're joined together that'll be a single negative . O H O H is is a single negative but keep it inside the bracket that's it and don't forget the two applies to everything inside there so Yeah. we'll finish up with two negatives one from each O H. So hydrogen Right. reacts with the O H. Yeah. And the S O four reacts with C A the calcium. So hydrogen there's two of this hydroxide. Two hydroxides so if you just write twice just write O H negative and then another O H negative. Yeah H two er no yeah I need H two O H mm no two H two O. Brilliant. Two H two O yeah. What we've got if you write them out separately Yeah. just to show what's happening. What have we got we've got two lots of H positive okay there's one H positive and there's another H positive. Yeah. They're two separate it's H positive times two. What have we got here O H negative times two. Two lots of O H negative. Right now we're just back onto what we were doing here. One H positive one O H negative gives you the H two O we've got two lots of that so we're going to get two H two O. Mhm. And you've even and you've even balanced the equation as you've done it. And then what's left over. Right. Two H two O and now we've got the sulphate and the calcium. Mhm. And they're both double negative and double positive . That's right. So it's C A S O four. . So that's that's something that you've never done before an equation you've st perhaps never even heard of calcium sulphate. But just from that little table which you'll get used to as work through them, you can work what would happen. So you can Mm. work out what would happen for any of the any of the acids with any of the alkalis . Mm. Erm do you want to try another one? Yeah yeah . Yeah. It's the the the time to do another one is when you think, Oh yeah there's no problem here I've definitely got this. then it's a good idea just to do another one and make sure. Okay sh so erm let's try mm say stay with erm sulphuric acid, so sulphuric acid plus erm Sulphuric er yeah. Sulphuric acid plus what shall we have out of this lot. Erm how about ammonium erm hydroxide. H H two S O four Yeah. plus what was it again? erm Ammonium hydroxide. Ammonium N H four er O H Right. I know that's a positive that's a double negative the N H four a positive and that is a negative. So again the H two and the O H Right. make er H two O Okay. H O plus What have you got left over? the S O four and the N H four that's a double negative and that's a single positive it's going to be two N H four S O four no erm let me think about it again er what's wrong with S O four N H two N H four. It's you you were Yeah. you were right the first time. Right. So it's N H four Two N H four I said. You're going to have two lots of N H four right. Let's let's say we were doing Right now what do you mean by that? What does this two apply to? Erm the N H four so brackets Let's with the two afterwards. Right brilliant. So S O four bracket N H four two. Right so it's the right way round N H four N H four twice so N H four two S O four. S O four. Right. Erm when you put two H two O what did you mean?two H two O wherever it was there it is. Two waters. Yeah and how many hydrogens all together? Er one oh no two four hydrogens. And how many oxygens? Two. Right so if you put the number in front, it's as though you've got brackets around the whole lot. I mean Mm. really you should have brackets round the whole lot but we don't bother to put them. Yeah. should do it's a bit sloppy in the notation convention. So if you just wanted two hydrogens when you put it down here. If you just wanted two N H fours you'd put it down here. Okay? Yeah. So I think you've definitely got that Right. very well on that. Erm nitrates, sulphates and what else any other 'ates that you've heard of? Erm nitrates, sulphates Okay now just stick with those . I'm just think I I'm just thinking. Don't worry. Er There's there's one in there. Yeah I'm just thinking . another ate. And it's not it's not the same as these as these it's not Chlorate. Chlorate yes there is a chlorate. Erm there's one down there. Carbonate. Carbonate which is not quite the salt not the sort of thing you get from an acid normally like sulphuric, sulphuric acid give you the sulphate. What's the special thing about carbonates and acids? I mean is a carbonate erm an alkali? Erm no. What happens when you drip an acid on a carbonate? Don't know. Do you know any carbonates? Are you warming up? I'll just I'll just So what happens when you drip acid onto a carbonate? Do you know any carbonates. Not really no. Well I probably do but. Okay er have you come across calcium carbonate? Yeah. What's that look like? Erm Is it normally a solid or a liquid or what? a liquid? No no erm it's a solid. Okay, what sort of rocks have you come across? Erm erm marble chippings. Marble chippings okay so what happens when you drip acid onto marble chippings? Er you told me last week remember but I can't remember. Er have you ever seen it done? No. Er I may have been absent or something . Right okay. What often happens when you drip acids onto things? They react. React maybe it's carbonates they Effervesce Yeah effervesce they fizz a bit. What's happening? Er they're producing gas they're giving off Okay what gas? Carbon dioxide. Right. Mm. So acid plus carbonate gives? Er carbon dioxide. Right and probably a few other things. Yeah. Let's see if we can work out what it is. So let's pick a nice simple acid. The choice is yours. Erm Which is the easiest one to play with? H C L. Yeah H C L good choice plus and we'll pick an easy carbonate, er we'll pick the one that we normally use calcium carbonate. Which is C A erm and carbonate is C O three C A C O now that's a positive negative the calcium is a double positive double nega positive yeah. And the C O three is a double negative. Right. Right hydrogen and the carbonate so there's going to be H brackets two C O three yeah? Okay well maybe maybe. It's a good try. Erm the chlorine and the calcium it's a double positive Er Ah you remembering anything? Go on carry on I could write two H C O three Erm well what's the difference between H two C O three and Er two H C O three. that's two of H C O three . Right right H two is just two of H. Right so there i they're not the same compound at all. You can't just No no . swap one for the other. So what's what's happening with the chlorine then? Er two C A yeah. Okay. Now we usually write the metal first. Yeah. So we'd have calcium chloride Yeah so I'll rearrange it Okay how would you write that? Just rearrange that. Right Okay well that's quite possibly what does happen. Now go to the C L, it's just one element, we don't need the brackets it wouldn't be wrong to write the brackets round it but we don't usually bother. No. You can just write C A C L two Right. for that. Now this thing H two C O three erm so you've tried the reaction, you've tried these different compounds Mm. pull 'em apart shove 'em back together again see what you can make. And you've made this thing, hydrogen carbonate Yeah. and calcium chloride. The calcium chloride's definitely going to get formed. But we decided that you get carbon dioxide. Oh yeah. Right so maybe this is an intermediate stage, we don't know but we know carbon dioxide comes out of it. What would happen if you took carbon dioxide out of this? What' do Mhm. you know the formula for carbon dioxide? Er di is two isn't it? Right good. So it's carbon which is C Right. C O two. Okay so just re write C O two underneath it. C O two. Now if you took C O two out of that, what would you have left? You're left with H two O er so it's Right. H two O plus C O three plus C O two . Right Yeah. Yeah. plus C A C L two. No you don't need the brackets Yeah. it's better without the brackets they'd probably accept it with. Okay so this was worked out not really knowing anything about what's going on here we've got that and that go together what would happen well pretty good bet that you'd get this calcium chloride cos that seems to form pretty easily. Mhm. the other reactions we've had. calcium hydroxide hydrogen chloride you get calcium chloride formed and you got this thing well it's quite likely that this does form initially, but it doesn't last very long and it's not very stable and it Right. splits up splits up into carbon dioxide and water. Mm. Erm and that's it we've sorted out the reaction. So just going back to these 'ates, sulphate has got sulphur and oxygen in it, a carbonate has got what? Er carbon and and oxygen. A nitrate has got? Nitrogen and oxygen. Now a chloride Chlorine and Just the the metal and the chlorine so sodium chloride would just be N A and then C L. Chlorate would have Chlorate yeah chlorine and oxygen. That's it so there is a system behind all these weird names Yeah. there's a bit of a system. Erm once you sort of crack the code and get into it, things you've never heard of when they come up you when you know the system you think, Oh well I know what I know what it means by that. So if someone said erm bromate or bromide say what's the difference between calcium bromide and calcium bromate, what the difference be? Bromide is just the bromine with the Yeah. metal, bromate is bromine with the oxygen. Good so it might be it might be something like B R O three or B R O or B R O two something like but it would have oxygen to go with it. So you're building up now I think a good understanding of the er terminology Right. and a good understanding of the the systems and putting these numbers in the equations. Yeah. So as you feel happier with that, you'll b more able to play with them. But unless you do play them forget it again . exactly, it'll be cos we looked at this last week as you said at the end what happens dripping acid onto onto chips now the things to know about acids,bases and salts. A metal plus an acid what happens? A metal and plus an acid. Drip metal onto an acid I'm sorry acid onto a metal . Right. think that might be a bit difficult er It might be a bit awkward if you it might be highly reactive if you dropped molten metal onto it. Erm it reacts and produces carbon dioxide. Mm would it, no a metal with an acid. It's a metal erm Erm it effervesces. Right so there's a gas given off which is? Carbon dioxide Hydrogen. Okay right so there's a s there's a system to what's going on with the acids and it's not just one acid like hydrochloric most of the acids will do it some of them do it very readily some of them you have to get the conditions right often you have to get the temperature high to make it to make the reaction go but a metal plus an acid erm there's a typical one zinc H two S O four gives zinc sulphate and the hydrogen. Yeah. And you can think of that pretty easily if you look at your table erm just write down with the charges on the the ions what H two S O four looks like. H two S O four. right erm what's the charge on that H? Positive. Right good. Er double negative. Yeah great how did you work that out? Er the Hs are positive. Right. Yeah and there's two of it so that Good so that was I like that because you worked it out you didn't look it with table you Yeah. Good. So it's H two S O four plus erm a metal erm chose zinc then shall we try it no we'll use zinc. Yeah. have you got it in here? No. No. Okay we'll use erm Yeah zinc ion Right. Z N two plus. Right. thought it should be in there cos it's normally Okay now all that happens here if you if you think of it going back to the picture with the the magnets or the electrostatic charges or or bonds whatever you like to think of it . Yeah. You've got an S O four with two bonds on it and it's holding on to a hydrogen Yeah. in each one. And the zinc comes along and pushes the hydrogen out, it says, Hang on I want that sulphate. Yeah. and it displaces the hydrogen and that we that's why we describe it the the zinc displaces the hydrogen from the acid. So zinc sulphate gets formed the zil the zinc just goes in in place of that H two. So it becomes Z N S O four. And the two Hs that got pushed out H two yeah? Yeah. H two and the charge erm now ah ah hang on yeah this is this one is a bit tricky because that is not a zinc ion that's zinc just on its own so it's just Z N. Right. Erm it wants to be a Z N double positive and go with the sulphate Yeah. if you like so it pinches the two positive charges off the hydrogen cos in these equations the charges must must balance as well so that if you just cross the double positive out you need to you can't write it in but you need to remember that it wants to become a double positive given Yeah. the chance. So the zinc comes along pushes the hydrogen out takes its two charges off it as well Right. and you're left with H two. So that's the first sort of reaction with with acids. A metal plus an acid and most of the metals and most of the acids'll give you hydrogen. Some of them you remember the table we had a long time ago showing the reactivity of different elements, particularly the metals when we were looking at metals. Erm some metals are much more reactive than others. I mean some some metals with an acid a fairly weak acid will give you hydrogen, some metals will give you hydrogen just with s water, or with steam. And some of them it's it's hard to get them to go so but in general any of the fairly reactive acids and any of the fairly reactive metals they're going to give you a salt and hydrogen. So metal plus acid gives you a salt and hydrogen. And you can do that. Then we've got a base plus an acid, what's the difference again between a base and an alkali? A base Mm. is neutral no a base Is an alkali a base? Yeah. Yeah okay. A base So what's so special about an alkali that's not quite a special about a base. Erm erm An alkali is a base but a base isn't an alkali. Hey? Yeah. Erm an alkali is contained in the base family but it's got a special property. Erm It's a fairly simple physical property actually but they're they're soluble. Right. So Mm. But this thing we've been doing with an acid and an alkali, most of the bases will do it as well, Yeah. so let's try that one. Now the base is erm most of the oxides are bases the metal oxides so what would magnesium oxide look like? And what's going to happen if we get it to react with H two S O four? So try that one H two S O four plus magnesium oxide what's that going to be? M G Oxide Is? So that's a double positive a double negative that's a positive double negative so H two and the O so that's gonna be that'll be a double positive because there's two of it wouldn't it? It's it's well Yeah. Erm You wouldn't write it like that but you'd write it as a single positive okay now because there's a two But because there's two of it down there you've got two Yeah. negative two positive That's hooks on it H two O plus S O four erm that's a double negative so the goes there so magnesium M G S O four Let's have a look. Oh that's a shame. What? was going to say check it in the book but I gave you wrong one. Never mind. Okay I'll do the other one Okay check it yeah okay try the other one then. Erm an easier one in fact. Erm magnesium oxide with hydrochloric acid. M G oxide which is O right with Hydrochloric acid. H C L and that's a double positive Right. double negative. Good. That's a single positive Right. that's a negative. Right. Right. And what's going to happen what was the first way you can see. Magnesium chloride Well try the the one you tried in the first equation Oh yeah. we did. Oxygen and a hydrogen. Right so what have we get we've got one O negative So that'll be H O erm two O. Yeah that's the H two O. Where did the two Hs come from you've only got one there? Er you'll add another. Okay put a put a two in front now. And what's that going to give you? Two that's going to become a double. So it's going to give you two Hs and two C Ls . Two C Ls so that'll be H two O plus magnesium chlorine so that's a M G C L two Brilliant go on see if that's well I'm saying so see if that's what it gives in the book. M G O It just says it's aqueous but but I mean when it when it when it happens Yeah. because magnesium chloride is soluble it'll be dissolved in the water and you'll finish up with a solution of magnesium chloride. That's it so metal and acid gives what? A metal and an acid gives erm er water and This is the one that doesn't give water. Oh yeah er What did the zinc do to the hydrogen? Carbon dioxide and Hang on hang on metal and acid say think of the zinc and which acid was it we used H two S O four, what did the zinc do to the hydrogen? Er it pinched its good go on it what did it do? Right it pinched its positives its electrons. Right it pinched its place and it pinched its charge, it displaced it it pinched it out of its nice cosy relationship So you get hydrogen. and it liberated the hydrogen okay. So that's an acid plus a metal, now an acid plus a base which is this one we've just done, a metal oxide the metal oxides are bases, er you can think of them as being alkaline, we call it basic but very very similar sort of thing to alkaline okay so what happens with a base and an acid? With a base and an acid Well what happens with an acid and an alkali? Er acid and alkali er it gives a water and sal. Right great and what happens what seems to be happening with a base and an acid or an acid and a base? Erm gives off hydrogen ah no gives off It gives you well this is erm this is one that you did here. It gives off water. This is one you did here yeah you get water and? Er er the metal chloride magnesium chloride in this case in this case you got a chloride if you'd used sodium you would have got sodium chloride which is? Er Oh right salt. So this is magnesium chloride is also a? Er salt. Right so we tried couldn't eat it though. acid and a base Mm. acid and a base and we get salt and water, try alkali and a base you get salt and water so they're very similar reaction, the base and the acid and the alkali and the acid. They're the same sort of thing they're neutralizing each other. And the other one with the carbonate what happened then? The one you Er. worked out yourself. The carbon which one was that? erm cos there's so many of them now I'm getting a bit I know and I'm trying to pile them up now and let you see the patterns so these The carbonate I can't remember what it is I'm getting confused I okay Right you mentioned it a few minutes ago you suggested that this thing was formed. Which one wa I I can't remember what I sa I was saying a f a lot of things a few minutes ago . Right okay okay carbonate. What's the er what's the symbol for carbonate? Er C C C C C O? Yeah C O? Two. Three. Three yeah. C O three and what did you take out of that? An O no C ah Let's go back to where you did it here. What you did was you tried H C L plus calcium carbonate. Yeah. Okay and you sorted this out very nicely what was going to happen and what you'd have left over. Right so you got your calcium chloride out and then you got this H two C O three. Which we said do left over. Erm er carbon dioxide. Right so you looked at this H C L plus C A C O three quite messy. Yeah. What can we get out of this? Mm can't see any water there can't see any H and O H. Yeah. But there's our old friend calcium chloride right. Yeah. You take calcium chloride out, what have you got left? You've got this H two C O three. Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Hi some refreshment. Lovely. Don't tell me you don't like them. There's not a lot is there? Do you what more? You've you've been scratching then? Oh useless. Come on Charlie out. go on out out Out. out. he said he can't hear you with that on Yeah he can. Right. Got an ear problem? Erm well he split his tail the end of it. Yeah I saw his tail was bandaged. So we had the end cut off and to stop him ripping the bandages off we Ah. wrapped it up. Mm. The vet wrapped it up but he also had a little thing on his ear so he cut that out as well and he's gonna wear the collar to stop him scratching his ear and to stop him biting his tail. cos he's been in a fight has he No erm it was just it was just like a little er spot on his ear and the vet sent it off to find out what it was Mm. and he cut it out and stitched it up so. Right. Okay meanwhile back at the carbonates so you've sorted out your calcium chloride and you've got this horrible looking thing H two C O three. Right. But we know this is marble chippings you know you were getting this carbon dioxide off. How could you tell it was carbon dioxide what tests c could you do to it? Erm if it's carbon dioxide it'll react with lime water wouldn't it. Yeah. Make clear lime water cloudy. Right that's it makes it milky. And it will put out a glowing splint or something. So if there w well we've got to get carbon dioxide out of this somehow cos we know carbon dioxide is given off. So you're doing a bit of detective work here, what must be happening in this? Well let's take carbon dioxide out of that and what do you get? Well out of that you've got all the makings there of carbon dioxide and water. So Mm. gives us the other thing that happens with them that er an acid plus a carbonate gives you carbon dioxide as well as a salt and water. Right. And that's that's about it for the acids. It also brings in the bases the the basic the bases and the alkalis. If you know that lot just there, you can probably get through about ooh eighty percent of your chemistry. Yeah. At least seventy five percent you can work out well what have we got we got an acid or a base or a carbonate or what, and does it fit any of the I mean there aren't many patterns, there's metal acid, what does that give? Metal and acid. Yeah. Er carbon dioxide no er oh I'm getting confused now there's that many of them that I know I know I know but I want to just keep going round the lot. Metal and an acid It might help if you write them. Nah, I don't think it is I l it's just remembering they're all different and I Right they're all different but they're similar enough to be a bit confusing. So right okay okay It effervesces with it and it gives off Oh shit Okay right Can I look back and No no no no no work it out Oh fucking hell. work it out. It's getting too confusing I've got to try it cos if I just yeah yeah no no you've keep on working it out I won't remember it. So you've got what have we got we've got a metal the one we used was zinc Yeah. Z N plus an acid let's use H C L H C L. and what happened remember what happened what what did well what what's going to get formed with zinc and chlorine about? Zinc chloride. Right okay. Take zinc chloride out of that take the zinc and the chlorine away and what have you got left with? Hydrogen. Okay. Yeah. So you didn't remember it you worked it out. Now you you're very keen on remembering everything you can't remember everything Yeah because if I work it out I'll just know that i it made so and so but I won't know that it gave off that I'll just remember that it made like zinc chloride or something I won't remember if i I'll just remember the symbol I won't even remember the symbols but I'll just know that I can work it out if I needed to. Not I won't remember the answer. Okay I mean the question on the paper might well be, What happens when a metal reacts with an acid. Yeah. Not any particular one so then you've got to think well I don't know can't remember well let's try it what would happen let's try zinc maybe you'll vaguely remember we tried zinc and hydrochloric Mm yeah. What would happen well you're almost certainly going to get the zinc chloride and what have you got left, hydrogen ah. So what happens with any acid and any metal with a mes a metal and an acid you're going to get a salt and hydrogen given off. So this is Yeah. this is your way of working back rather than try and remember every little detail because a lot of them are similar, easy to get confused between them but you think well hey what would happen, what happens with an acid and a base, what happens with an acid and an alkali, now those two are virtually identical they they are more or less identical. What what Mm. happens there? With an acid and a base. Well the easiest one perhaps is what happens with an acid and an alkali. Erm you get a water and a salt. Right now you didn't need to go did you need to go back to remember any No. specific ones? No. No and the same thing happens with a base Water and salt. Water and a salt. And then the other thing is what happens with a carbonate and an acid? Erm carbon dioxide. Right and? Er hydrogen no carbon dioxide water. Yeah and? And? you've you've worked it you've worked it out over here and yeah and. What did you do you got this horrible looking thing and we said oh that doesn't happen because we know we've got carbon dioxide Oh er you mean But you'd already taken out It made Yeah I know it made that but I thought you just wanted to know what it gave off. Oh okay what every everything that's made so It's calcium chloride. Right so there's a salt and the carbon dioxide And the a and the water. Water. So if you want to just sort of remember them all, as a table we've got sort of say acid plus metal and see what happens see what's given off, well we get a salt a lot of the time don't we and we Yeah. get water a lot of the time so erm salt,water,hydrogen,carbon dioxide. Yeah. Can you remember what happens with the metal? Erm acid and the metal what did we get? Acid and metal it gives off hydrogen . Right okay so it's hydrogen and? Erm salt. Right. Brilliant. Acid plus an alkali that's about the easiest one . That's er salt and water. Right. Acid plus alkali gives you salt and water. Yeah. And. Acid and a base. Good. And that gave you what? Er salt and water. Right and acid and perhaps the most awkward one the carbonate. Which gave? Right er hydrogen The carbonate carbonate carbonate Oh yeah carbon dioxide Dioxide okay . Yeah carbon dioxide and the water that was it I was thinking I saw the H two yeah and and the water yeah and the water and the and salt. salt. Right. Okay so that's your table of what goes on. Now you can look at that and sort of chant it out to yourself and learn that as a table or learn it visually or vaguely remember some of it and fill in the gaps by going back, What happened when we tried when we dripped ac acid on a metal? Yeah. Hydrogen. What happened when we dripped acid on marble chippings on a carbonate? What did happen? Er marble chippings on effervesces it gives off carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide okay what happens with the old standards the alkalis? Er water and a salt. Yeah and the same for the bases. Right. So I reckon you've got that all sorted out. You know the sys that I mean that's the system this is say this is the key to a good getting on for eighty percent Yeah. of the chemistry you need. Erm you'll be able to look at it and say, Well is it a is it an acid and a base, acid alkali, acid metal, acid carbonate. If it is even if you've never heard of them before you know sort of funnium carbonate or something Yeah. You're going to think well I know what will happen, we'll get if you drip hydrochloric acid on it you'd get funnium chloride water and carbon dioxide. Yeah. Right. You'd need to know Yeah. what the valency is to make up this formula you could do the same if it was if someone told you it was an some unknown So if it's an unknown compound and I drip Let's say it was unknown compound and I dripped hydrochloric acid on and I got carbon dioxide given off yeah Yeah. and I got calcium chloride and water formed what was it that I was dripping onto? Er and you got calcium I got I got carbon dioxide given off Yeah. so it must have been? Erm a carbonate. It must have been Good it must have been some sort of carbonate, and the salt that was formed was from the hydrochloric acid was calcium chloride, so it must have been? Calcium carbonate. So I mean if I I might have magnesium carbonate and I drop hydrochloric acid on Yeah. what would I get? Magnesium carbonate Magnesium carbonate drop hydrochloric acid onto that. Magnesium hydroxide Magnesium salt of hydrochloric acid? It's it's all too much I'm getting a bit confused now it's Okay okay okay go back so what you need is a when you get when you get I'm I'm trying to do too much at once now it's Okay okay When you get confused when you get lost you've got to go back and find your direction again so carbonates carbonates Yeah but it's not it's not, Oh I don't what direction I'm heading in. I'm trying to do too many things at once and I'm getting, Oh oh is it. and this kind of thing it's getting er I just think I'm going to end up more confused by trying to do it all at once than if I concentrate on one thing at a time. Cos I'm going to be getting it mixed in future now . okay let's say let's say we're looking at carbonates Yeah. Right we're we're dripping this acid on a carbonate erm and you know you've worked out you've remembered, Carbon dioxide and water and a salt. but what on earth is the salt? Well they all give a salt. Which is the easiest one to remember for working out the salt out of these four here? Which is the easiest one to remember The easiest equation if I said, Write down the equation for one of these. which one would you go for as being the easiest the one you're most sure about? Er er the acid and an alkali. Right acid and alkali okay so try it. H C L plus an alkali C A O H is that is that balanced what's C A? Er double positive. C A double positive okay so how many O Hs will we need to go with that? Two. Right good cos the O H is only a single negative. S You don't need brackets at the end do you? S erm I need if I just put C A O H two Yeah. it would only be two Hs Right. cos they're separate elements. Like Yeah. each capital letter starts a new element and that would mean one C A one O and two Hs but what I is one C A and two O Hs which is two Right. Os and two Hs yeah? Yeah. So I've got that lot and what's the salt? Forget about all the rest of it, we know it gives water okay. Calcium chloride. Right now calcium carbonate C A C O three, is that balanced up? What do we need how many do we need that's a double positive what about C O three? Er Well have a look where's the C O three gone? Okay Erm . And that is a double negative so that's balanced. Well you you wrote the equation out you worked out what was happening, that and the you need two of those So those two got together and the salt again was? Yeah. Yeah. You're you're looking at the carbonate trying to work out what on earth goes on here what is the salt when you drop hydrochloric acid onto the carbonate. Don't know but I can remember what happens with the alkali and the acid, you get calcium chloride, er it's the same. The salt is the same all the way through here. whether you're dropping it on the putting the acid to the the alkal the the metal, the alkali, the base or the carbonate, the salt is always a salt of the acid. So hydrochloric acid always gives you the chloride, sulphuric acid always gives you the sulphate, nitric Yeah. acid always gives you the nitrate. Yeah. Okay and that's the so that pattern straight the way through for all these four reactions it doesn't matter which one you do. So the salt you can remember it through going back to the acid plus alkali reaction, it's the same one you get there. Right. The base acid base it's exactly the same, there's no difference, you're going to get the same salt and the and the water. Carbonate it's the same again just chuck in the extra C O two. Right. And perhaps the most difficult one to remember is the easiest of the lot, the acid plus the metal cos there's none of the usual stuff, no salt no water just the hydrogen coming off. Yeah. But it's you can I know you think it's a lot to take in Yeah. but if once you can see it as a pattern, all this lot fit together and you're not If you learn those four reactions separately a month apart or something yeah? You're learning the same information over and over again, this lot you're learning the whole lot once it's it's as though every time you learned a word, you had to learn your alphabet all over again Right. and didn't realize that the A made the same sound in this word as it does in that. I know it doesn't in most but but there is enough of a a tie up Mm. to make it easier to learn that way. Now do you still feel that it is too much for you to take all that lot in in one go, or do you think it's all it's it's it's gu it's A little bit yeah. you know Yeah. gelling together a bit. No I think what it is I understand it now but if you ask me in a couple of weeks Right. I'm not going to be sure wheth whether an acid and a carbonate Well I'll ask you every week. I might say yeah I'll ask you every week. can I just say something but I might get an acid and a carbonate mixed up with an acid and a metal. Or Okay. an acid and a metal with an acid and a carbonate . But but but if you write the formula down let's say let's say you get it all wrong and I say, What happens if you have an acid and an alkali? and you say, Well I know they all give a salt so that's a safe bet, so I'll say they give a salt. erm they all give a water apart from the one that's just with the metal right, so water's a good bet. And I think this gives carbon dioxide. Let's say you're doing acid plus alkali and for some reason you think, Oh well I think it gives carbon dioxide. So I say, Okay where does your carbon dioxide come from then. Acid H C L and the standard alkali acid alkali reaction we use, what do we normally pick for the alkali? What's Er the well known one we keep choosing? er sodium hydroxide. Right all the alkalis, that we're using anyway, all the hydroxides are alkaline. So what's going to happen there? They go together the chlorine and sodium go together to make the sodium chloride and the H and the O H go together and make the water. You've got no chance of making C O three out of that you haven't got the C anywhere. Yeah. So if you want to make sorry C O two if you want to make C O two out of something you're going to at least have to have a C in it somewhere. Right yeah . And which one of this lot has got the C in? Is it the metal, the alkali, the the number, hit the tab key and you've actually lined up the first line along with the rest of your paragraph. So you produce nice numbered lists, looking very neat! Okay? Everything is lined up underneath the tab stop. Now this kind of ordering text on a page if you're using a typewriter takes quite a lot of skill but if you're a, with a word processor it's actually quite easy. Honest! Right! Oh! Have you got yourself into a total er Yes . Right! Okay. Go shift F ten or select now go alt P and cancel all paragraph formats. If you will just wait it takes a bit of time to get back where you want. Ah! Yeah! So however a big a mess you make of things however big a mess you make of things everything is usually retrievable. So rarely can you actually mess up a document in such a way that is totally irretrievable than the way in which things look. It's not coming right over . Yeah. Right, fine! Can't get anyway. Go alt space bar should be it. So this is fun learning to format! If you got mice i , you can also make things easier by actually moving that arrow around until you get to the individual word that you actually want to find and actually then you stop your cursor there. So, if you've got a mouse you could actually help speed up a lot of this editing but, I said, I've not written in the mouse commands into this schedule because we didn't actually have mice on all work stations when this was written. So, as I go round I'll show you erm, how to use the mouse er a as as and when it becomes er appropriate. So what you'll have to do now is go back to erm page eighteen I guess, no haven't got page eighteen have we? I keep on losing bits of my document! Yeah, I should get one that yeah page ten, it says return to your letter and essentially i it tells you all the various formatting options that you want to apply to your document to make it look neat and tidy. So, just go through pa , the er commands on page ten and follow the instructions. And you should actually then produce a letter which is neat and tidy and worthy to send to to Doctor and not to your cat! And just to prove that some students have got the hang of this this is a letter that er David produced and, it actually looks quite good! So, he's only had the same length of time doing this as you have so, by the end of the afternoon you ought to be in the position to print out a really neat final version of of of the letter. One that you'll be proud, proud of. Can I borrow a book, please? Yeah sure. Also, if anybody's not actually paid me for their book that they actually purchased last week, I'm open to accept payment today. So is anybody in immediate problems at the moment or you're o Okay, so, I'll, it's your chance now to do some work then for the next twenty minutes or so. Can you accept payments next week? Yes. I'll go on accepting payment until the course finishes okay? I'll keep reminding you. Oh, is it possible to Sir! Copy one disc onto another disc, how come I've done that? And why is it ? You want the file off? No, why? I seem to have gone into this exactly the same somehow. Well if you copied all the files over. Well I haven't though. I ju I jus I haven't been asked to. But I wonder if I've done something copied one to six. I bet that has. If you go into DOS right! So you go into A cos we've got that disc in. Yeah, that's the one that I keep . Oh. Then just ask it to list all the files on that disc. Yeah. Yeah? And then there's the next one. Oh right! And that now will list the same files on that disc Right. and in fact it is more or less the same but you check if some of them are missing. But then I've lost my . I've lost Well all the other things that were on this disc originally. Ee! Yeah, originally! work. That one is now on this one, there's nothing on this. And you just used all the just did that? Yeah I just did it as you said. I did a few of them . Right. Well that's alright I did that . Yeah. I mean some of your letters are there aren't they? Erm There's some of there. Yeah but that's and a couple of ones like that, and that one. That one, but I actually got onto the the server. Yeah, but that's what's on the server isn't it? Yeah. But, then, that's all your files that are available now, I think you've lost Some of them must have been on there. Have you done your boot? No, but that's on that one. This one here Oh yeah! Well I think that's happened , it's not like they dis , totally disappeared. Is there any way you can delete like the whole the at once? Yes. Right. I mean, if you want to say delete a temporary file press del for delete Yeah. then star that stands for a wild card, that'll do all files which have got the back up. Oh right! You better go and get some tea Margaret I haven't had a chance yet! Oh right! Have you not done your bit yet? I've done my bit. Yeah. Oh! Right! Come and have a cup of coffee then? Come in. Doctor , as you're finished would you mind seeing the next ? No problem. Thank you. Esther . She's supposed to have Tamazepan and Frumil is it okay for her to take these? Yes. So you've just changed them? . Aye. Fine. Eh? Right. Yeah, she's alright. She won't die with those. Alright. Oh, about his car I wanna know about three things about him. Not his clothes not his car not his moustache not the things he was wearing, three obvious things about that man. Three obvious things about that man. Go for it. The w the erm way he said erm No no the obvious things. He said it, but I wanna know three obvious things about him. Three very obvious and things you would forget about him straight away because it's so obvious. Think about it. Erm er he talked really No. nice. Yes he talked really nice, but the obvious things. If you was describing that man you'd all get his clothes I bet, but I bet there's three things you would forget about him, straight away. Obvious things, because it's so obvious you're forgetting, think about it. Medium built. Medium built was he? No he was skinny. Shh. Was he? Mm yeah. Was he medium built or, what was you gonna say? Skinny and tall. S s skinny and tall? Who agrees with him? Who agrees with him? It's a obvious thing about him, he was not being horrible, skinny and tall. You've said two things about him. What's the next obvious thing, very very obvious thing about him that we're forgetting? So obvious you're gonna, all gonna go oh yeah! He was white. Oh I know. Good man. He's white. He's a white tall skinny man. Yeah? Was he short and fat like me? He was tall and skinny. Yeah? Now, describe that man his clothes, describe his clothes. Black, I mean brown jacket.

But remember there are people out there who want to hurt you. Yeah? You've had this video now and I've come to this school since you started this school, so you should know more about Stranger Danger than other schools cos I keep coming every year and talking to you about it. And I think we must have had this video three times, you should be word perfect by now. Just remember there are people out there who will be cruel and unpleasant to you. They may appear nice but they're not and someone you don't know is a stranger. Now after that, all have a nice holiday and play safe. Speak to you later and have a nice holiday if I don't see you. Thank you. You're more than welcome and take care. Play safe, yeah? and then I saw you on there. Did you? You was all having to be quiet weren't you? I'm not sure because there was these two blokes What's that? and they were going That man's recorded everything that was said in this room. Excuse me er It's alright it's anon anonymous. Who told you the facts of life? Did they tell you the truth? Or are you still working it out for yourself? Sex education used to be whispered, sniggered and gossiped about, today, we're more enlightened, or are we? Exactly what should be taught, to whom, by whom, and when still provokes heated debate. So, we thought we'd find out what young people want to know, and what they think of the education they've had. After all, this hundred young women have all benefited from the open, healthy, society that's developed over the last few decades, or have they? Let's start with a question. Have you had formal sex education? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And in this hundred, amazingly, twenty two people say no! Seventy eight said yes. Let's start with the yes's,wha what was it, the formal sex education, you seventy eight? What have you had and where? Sex in, section six in a biology class about plants flowers and that That was it! That was it? Yeah. Plants and flowers? Yeah. Didn't you even got on to frogs and rabbits? No. Flowers. What about so And that's all anybody got was section six, this dreaded section six which we were taught at the end of the year! And that's all anybody got in my school. How about humans? No. No, just about plants ! Seriously? Yeah. Beside you. Yeah, we had erm a class, an actual sex education class, every week for a year. Our biology teacher took it, but it was it was also so , it was the facts about erm sex, abortion contraception, but we also, also talked about the emotional side of things. So, would you say it was quite good? Yeah, it was quite. I mean, of course there were things that were missed out I suppose, but also, I suppose, we were quite young, so it may have quite embarrassing and we didn't want talk about certain things. Was that the case or Round about twelve or thirteen, I suppose they kind of Do you think you were too young to talk about the th the emotional side Yeah. of it? Probably because most of us weren't really, well, quite a few of us anyway weren't thinking about sex at that time, so I suppose it was kind of you know, you just started your periods and everything and you Yeah. you're not exactly thinking about sex. Okay, so two not absolutely satisfactory er experiences there. Has any ,do has anybody had formal sex education of those seventy eight who that it was very we , it was well taught, that it was good? And you got a yes? Erm, sex education at school was Mm. similar to well the girl mentioned earlier on, that, since then I've had within the last couple of years Mm. erm, I do voluntary work for the Brook Advisory, er through the peer educators and that has been very erm beneficial for for myself and for the work that er, we do with What youths. Wha what what is that? I mean te tell me, tell us more about that. Well we go to youth clubs or schools and, talk to youths from eight to eighteen about contraception erm drugs and other topics of concern, abortion, homophobia, things like that. What do you think of that? I mean I I, I don't know, what do yo , what do you think sex education should be? Is it, is it important at all? It wasn't, it wasn't much of a subject when I was young, is it, is it a necessary part of the school curriculum? Is it something that should be taught at home? What do you think? I mean,wha , those of you who have children wha , what do you, what do you hope for them? Yes? I think it's very important. It's important people know the real facts about it instead a lot of this playground chatter. I also think it's important that people have this sort of emotional side of it taught to them as well, you're often taught like the straight, you know, the wee sperm and the wee egg come together and you get a baby, but you don't, not taught about the emotional side of it a lot Mhm. of the time, I think that's really important. Is it possible to teach that. Yes I think it is. I think it should be done a lot younger as well. Primary age? Yeah, primary I think, roundabout primary four or five, cos that's when they start talking about it, and that's where you start getting all the the wrong things told to you in the playground, I mean I know that's what happened to me. Really? So I mean, so wha , when, I mean how old when you found out, and who told you? Oh! I was about, I dunno about primary four age and someone in the playground, I think it was can't remember exactly what I was told, obviously, but it was something silly, you know, like really dirty and everything which Yeah. it isn't. Yeah. It's not a dirty thing . Yep. Yes? Yes? There. Oh, erm , I just want to say how can a four or five year old er, understand the concepts and the emotions involved in sexual relationships? Well they don't have to know If it's just erm exactly what it is, but th we should be told that it's not a dirty thing, it's not a bad thing. You know what I mean? At th , a lot of people are just told that it's so dirty, which is isn't and I Mm mm. just think should, you should get across that it isn't dirty. Mhm. Isn't it, but you don't you think that's more so for females than it is for males, the fact that it is such a dirty thing that, that applies more to females than it does, to males? I think it applies to both sexes. Can you avoid the kind of dirty, sniggering aspect though? I mean, is it possible to to, to have a holy, healthy attitude to, to sex? I think erm we could have a much healthier aspect to it if it was taught to u in a healthier way, I mean Mm. so many of the teachers that teach it are far too embarrassed to broach the subject sensibly, you know, and they just pass it on and so kids don't treat it sensibly. I feel we're expecting But don't you an awful lot from teachers, you know, we're just expecting that they know everything about sex education. I feel that teachers must be educated, if they can education us. Yeah. Any other views? Yes? That last point, you were saying about, you know giggling and laughing about it, I think, that that's a part of it, I mean sex can be fun Mhm. so what's wrong with er it shouldn't be dealt with in a like a really serious way, it should be fun for everybody and what's wrong with having a laugh about it as well? What about home? I mean er, I wonder in fact I mi I might as you this question, have you discussed er sex with your parents? Button one for yes, and button two for no. And, in this hundred sixty one, yes thirty nine, no. Does, do those votes surprise you? Do you think er yes? I think that everyone seems to pass the buck, I mean the parents think, oh they'll learn it at school and the teachers think, oh co they should be learning it from their parents, and yo , you never learn it from anyone just from your friends. Yes? I think erm sexuality begins with sensuality and therefore it should begin in the home, and it should be exaggerated at school, I mean, it should helped but fundamentally it's with your parents or guardians whoever, who should begin it. Is that your experience? Yeah, I mean I'm I'm very lucky because my parents are very liberal, and I mean they discussed sex with me quite early on and I've never had a problem discussing it with them. But that's not the case with everyone er I mean un unfortunately I wish it was. Yes? Yeah, that i , is precisely, it isn't the case with everyone, I mean, I think that what the girl was saying up there about the groups going round, it's a great idea! It was the same in the biology, biology teacher at our school, it was very hush hush and very embarrassed. Mm. I think if you got maybe a twenty five year old who came to your school for a week and got you in a small group and talked about it, it would be great on a one to one basis. Mhm. Erm,a , my mother didn't speak to me about sex until I was pregnant! You know which I I i wa , I wasn't totally embarrassed about it but I just we , I think she was, you know, that sort of generation and that era, which I hope with my son it will be totally different, like come to me and say anything you like, you know? Yeah. I'm a liberal parent. Yes? Yeah, there's probably two points I would want to say, one is that, what about the children and young people tha that refuse to go to school? And where's the education for them? I think the other one, about the woman across there said about, should start at home with sensuality and stuff and many of the young women that I work wi , I've I've heard very negative experiences of sex Mhm. through sexual abuse, and I think we spend a lot of our time, and I think even for teachers, we spend a lot of our time undoing a lot of the damage of helping young people, undo a lot of damage that's done by sex. I don't think they view it as a dead happy, enjoyable, fun thing and it's something that that they do if you say, is really serious and Mm. something that is nay er positive for them. It doesn't matter, I mean, where or whom you've been told by, as long as you've been told you can take precautions later in life from sexual diseases and and getting yourself pregnant. Mhm. What comes into sex education? I mean,th tha tha that's interesting what you said, because you said how to avoid sexual diseases and to er avoid getting pregnant, are those the basics of sex education or or what more would put onto the list of things that you would teach? Yes? I think when somebody teaches it they teach it in the premise that everybody they're talking to is heterosexual. What about people that are homosexual? What about like contraception should be integral part of it, and abortion and the options open to you, but I think it's very important that we are taught it, we're taught it in a heterosexual basis, and that's just not the case, and that just alienates people any more, really more from a very early age. Mhm. I'm still doing sex education at schools and look like it's changing a lot cos there's a lot more to do there, a lot more emphasis on Aids, that's why they've got to ki , teach kids in primary school, we've got to prevent them from getting a disease. Mhm. I was gonna say about sex education that when I was learning at school, it's also very male dominated erm it was, I mean you were talking about erm what's i li , the differences between males and females learning about sex education and wha , and we were learnt about the the man having pleasure, we were taught about the man having the erection and the man having the orgasm, I mean, we didn't even know what a clitoris was! Th I mean, I've never even heard of the term clitoris, and a friend of mine thought her clitoris was actually her epiglottis, I mean it just got the whole the thing just got completely confused. And that's when But do you think it's appropriate to teach sex in that kind of detail to to school children? Erm To tau , to teach pe , school children about sexual pleasure for instance, er er er rather than the biological facts of reproduction? I think it's part and parcel of sex, and so, yes, I do think it is very important and I think it is a process that does have to, have to be started very young, and is on-going throughout our education. Now I would guess that goes further that most school curricular. I mean has anyone learnt about sexual pleasure, at er, at school? Or about er, the male and female orgasms? Well obviously you learn about the male orgasm because that's what creates a baby but I think she was right, the female orgasm is never mentioned but it's there or should be. Ha! Yep? I think it's very important that er females should be taught that it's pleasurable for them as well, you Mm. haven't just to literally lie back there and the man says what happens, when it happens, and they're to do as they're told sort of thing because that obviously develops sexual abuse, women being raped, and attitudes that lead towards these things. It's very important you're taught that, er such feelings as respect, love, emotions all come into this and a woman has a right to say no, if she doesn't Yeah. want this, and it's not up to a man to decide what happens. But it seems that that isn't what's being taught, and therefore,in information about that comes, well either via your own experience or talking with friends or reading womens' magazines or I mean whe , where do we actually get our education from? Learn through Like you said more through magazines than I did at school, because in school I was taught nothing about pleasure, it was all very biological with a diagram of the male and the female, exactly what happened, there was nothing about er, sexually transmitted diseases, pleasure or abortion, contraception, nothing mentioned, only the mere basics. Now, normally in this programme when we talk about womens' magazines, people are inveighing against them because they carry various advertisements that they find offensive or exploitative, but are women's magazines actually erm performing quite a useful job by filling in the gaps that that schools and parents are are failing to address? What do you think? Any, yes? I think they're a very dangerous mode of education because they provide a very stereo-typed image of everything, everybody that they're talking about if they're talking about sex, they presume to be able bodied, they're presumed to be white generally, they're presumed to be heterosexual, if they're talking about homosexual then, it's definitely male lesbians Mhm. never come into it. I'm sorry, but I think these must be in the wrong magazines! The magazines that are out today are very informative of where you can get the addresses of places to go, they give both sides of homosexuality you know, male and female as far I've seen, and definitely in the past two years or so. Now, is that our best hope, is is is is the commercial provision of womens' magazine is the best hope we have for getting in, in any information we want? I mean, in an ideal world what wha what agenda would you draw up? I don't think it's necessarily about teaching er children primarily about sex or about sexual pleasure, I think it's all, initially, about personal hygiene and then developing that into how they can make their life safer for themself , or giving them choices to say, well I can choose to become pregnant or not to become pregnant and, I think it's more about choices rather than saying orgasms and erm sexual pleasure, or Mm. telling youngsters, when they can't actually understand the concept of having sex. Mm. Yes? I think if erm, perhaps if television did something more about it you'd be able to erm, home in on the people who are excluded, erm, people who are outside school, school situations, people Mhm. who don't actually go to school. Erm, looking at certain problems, a lot of erm young women who get pregnant don't get pregnant at school, they get pregnant as soon as they leave school. Mhm. Erm, in say, an area, a a deprived area it's very often hard for women to get access to information. Basically, there's a comparison of figures that erm one pregnancy in every two hundred and fifty six in Morningside is to women under twenty, yet one in four in, in an area like Craigmiller is to women under twenty so there's a big sort of difference. And you need to access, you need to key in to certain areas as well, so television could be the ideal way to do that. But it's not doing it at the moment, although there's Well no it certainly doesn't seem to be with, one in four girls getting pregnant. Well people generally complain about sex on television so, the way it's being presented. Up there. You often find that erm television with sex and everything, they always put it on after a certain time for children go to bed. It's like, Aids and that like the glue sniffing advert, for instance, put on fo when the children go to bed, but they should be able to see that,sho , they should be able to see look, well that's putting a message across to me as well , not just the parents, to me, I'm the one that's involved and I think that if well maybe the the producers would maybe or the people that do television would maybe put i to say, seven o'clock or that, where young children primary school age can actually sit and watch it. I think if you got taught sex education in maybe, smaller groups, you know erm if they could with individual teachers Mhm. er they, you know, were people that you trust and that you could ask questions that you wouldn't be embarrassed Mhm. that'd help a lot. Yes? Erm, I think if they were more honest and open, I mean like parents and schools and stuff, it wouldn't be so difficult for people to talk about it, and there wouldn't be as many, the jokes about it. If if everybody spoke about, the communication was better then it'd be a lot easier for people that deal with it. Yeah? Beside you. I think it's just our culture as well Mm. that influences our opinions on it, you know. And, I think it's really important that sex education in schools should be taught by somebody that the pupils can relate to. Cos I know when I was at school we actually got our sex education in fourth year, and it was by a visiting lecturer, it was this wee old man about fifty, he said basically, this is a male body, this is a female body, nothing about sexuality, orgasms anything! It was terrible! So I Aha. think that's really important. I'm going back to the thing about erm and boys and Mhm. today, in school we had a two members of a family planning association and er, we were in group and we actually had the guys in our class, they're seventeen, maybe eighteen sitting laughing and sniggering between themselves! And that's at that age! And I would say, in our school we've had the Aids team in and we've talked quite a lot about sex education and they're still sniggering! They're still having their jokes between Mm mm. themselves Mm. and whatever. I don't think we're ever gonna get away from that. Why do you think that is? It's I don't know what it was, er they hardly, we were having a discussion with the doctor, erm none of them would put forward their opinions or their views or what they thought No. we're talking about abortion, who's responsibility it was, erm they just were nay prepared to put forward their opinions. Is that your common experience that that young men aren't aren't really up to this? Yeah? No. I work for the same pre project as Verity and I worked with five, fifteen, sixteen year old boys, just yesterday, and they were one of the best groups I'd ever worked with because Mhm. they were interested. And it was contraception, which as you all know, is predominantly female and they were interested like, what their partners would use, what they will use and, it was wonderful! I couldn't believe because I always thought that it was the guys that sniggered, the guys that weren't interested Mm mm. and through past experience it is changing. Was it a mixed group or er No. No, we had five sa , boys no mixed. Do you think ma , do you think maybe that's, that's one of the answers, to separate the sexes for, for these discussions or No, I think maybe if the girls had been in they might have been a bit shier and felt you know, oh we have to act you know, the lads. Yeah. You know, so maybe but Yes? I think the guys snigger because they're covering up for their embarrassment that's Mm. their way of breaking the ice and showing that they just, they, that's way of coping with it. I think that they may be frightened to speak up and that they're scared that if they say something that they don't know, like a lot of them don't know the facts, like today, in the same class as Janine across there, some of them didn't know even the very the pro , progression of the male pill or anything like that, and they did learn a few things but a again they never spoke up and they weren't interested, but I Mm. think it was because of embarrassment. Yeah? Up there. I think, you know, I think in answer to the embarrassment question, I think although it is about that erm, people are nay do, people wi on just are nay prepared to commit with information, I think, in areas there's a wealth of information and experience Mm. and people who are prepared to discuss the issue but they just don't come out the door to where erm, the people are that need the information. I Mm. think there has to be a er family planning centres have to more on the street, I think family planning clinics have got the people there who are able to go out on the street. I think the other issue is that we have to be defending erm, the family planning centres that are being closed down, like the forty or fifty in Glasgow, the thirteen in er Edinburgh,th the east of Scotland Mhm. and I think that is just gonna create you know, a bigger ignorance amongst young people erm, you know a bigger ignorance about contraception itself Mhm. which again, there is nay a hundred percent safe contraception Mhm. to prevent pregnancy, or any other disease for that matter. And I think that's something that we're gonna have to start er defending, you know, because we er er, we, we have got a wealth of experience and information it just has to be shared. You're not suggesting pregnancy's a disease there are you? For some of us, aye, yeah. A It is a disease! In Holland er, young teenagers are taught in school how to how to use condoms, now I don't know whether that's taught in schools or, or classes in Scotland,i is it? It should be! Has anyone, I mean has anyone had that experience? Yes? Well I got a video and, like, that's all we got a few videos and the video showed you how to use a condom, and that was it. And that was at school? Yeah. But that's probably more than a lot of people did, and everyone's being urged to use condoms, but how many people are actually given any instruction on how to use them? Yes? Well yesterday we actually went to to a school and you show them how to use with a condom demonstrator and allow them to touch the condoms, and in youth clubs you allow them to do practically anything with them, as long as they're returned, they can blow them up, or they can Yeah. shoot them across the room or whatever. But I think all the silliness is all part of actually adjusting to the condom, and something to do with the embarrassment that because they don't know enough about it they, they don't want to be er, seen to be silly Mm. so, they put up a front, and Mm. I think it's all part of it, that they will be silly initially, but they'll som , soon co , er come to realize that it's sensible. Mhm. In a, in our school we were shown by our guidance teacher how to put a condom and he used a banana so, that just shows you that that can happen. And we it was fourth year when we done it and we'd never been shown anything like that and it was interesting because it's the sort of fact that you you never really think about Mhm. until yo you're actually gonna do it, sort of thing which I thought it was interesting. Do you think er, as young women you have a right, on behalf perhaps, of women ten years younger than you, to suggest changes in what's happening now? You're obviously in, and the other people in the, in the Brook are er advisory peer groups, are are doing work, people are suggesting, they they they think that should be extended, what more might be done? Audrey? I think it erm it possibly could be politicized and actually funded. I was wondering if erm the girl at the back was actually a volunteer or if she was in fact, paid for her work? Because I I do know of of various different groups who are working in this field as volunteers, there's no money behind them there, and I mean i i it should be a priority, it should be given that kind of priority where Mhm. funds are made for it. Mhm. Voluntary. It is voluntary. Yeah. I mean, yes? Can I just say that, about the age thing again, erm, I also do, with the Brook Peer Group Right. and erm I went to a youth club and I I was speaking to eight year olds and they're asking about condoms cos they've seen them in the street, so it's obviously they're wanting to find out about it cos it's everywhere around them even, doesn't matter what age. And what will you tell an eight year old? Erm, well we let them and again we brought out the demonstrator and we let them touch condoms erm do anything they wanted with them as long as we got them back. But they're fi , they're going to find about it cos it's everywhere. I think one of the main points is not so much the way it's taught but who teaches it. Because, going back to the point earlier on, erm, when I was taught I say, it was a local nurse from th er, the clinic that taught us I mean I've nothi , nothing against elder women in their fifties and whatever, but I mean, there again, one, it shouldn't always be females who teach about sex, it should be males, and it should be younger people to relate Mhm. to, because, one of the main points about the embarrassing er aspect, mainly boys sniggering and giggling, whatever, maybe some girls do, but it's mainly er, males, I think a point to be made there is, it is a well known fact that boys took longer to mature emotionally than girls and I think if it was a guy a younger guy, maybe in his late twenties, early thirties teaching it, and if he had the sort of guts to turn round and the bravery to say look son, what is it you're laughing at, what's so funny? I mean Mm. you're seventeen years old, if you're old enough to have sex surely you're old enough to you know, think about it in a mature way. And it would ta , take someone like that just to make them think, yeah, well, you know what is so funny in get rid of this sort of stigma about boys being immature. I also work for the peer group for the Brook Mhm. and er, we have two boys that do it with us as well and when they come out to youth clubs with us the girls and the boys that we go and speak to love having a male there Mhm. that they can go and the boys have a good laugh with them, and the girls have a good laugh as well and it seems to work. A , any concluding thoughts on er on the future for sex education in Scotland? I'd agree that it's important Yeah. that people can make their o , they have a balanced education which allows them then to make their own choices about, that things aren't over, I mean if we've lived in a patriarchal society in which men are in power and that kin , and male sexuality maybe has come through more in sex education, those have been the issues that have been co ,ha have been given more importance and female issues have maybe been neglected a little bit and now erm, with Aids as a problem we don't want to turn out and suddenly become really homo homophobic or really, you know, right condoms, condoms, it has to be you know, you need to kind of keep the balance so that people are given the information and then have the freedom to make the choice themselves. I think they should get rid of the stigma in condoms, cos what frightens me is that in about ten years time my daughter will come and maybe ask if she can go on the pill and at least I can tell her no, use a condom there's less chance of sexually transmitted diseases, but it's my sons they won't come and ask. Yes? I think the problem is, that at the moment sex education is so arbitrary and it varies from school to school and from house to house I think they have to make it like a core part of the curriculum, make it compulsory and make it uniform throughout the country, so everybody's getting the same education, the same quality I think that'll help. Lots of good ideas. Thank you very much for discussing this and opening up watch, what is, too often a a a taboo area. I hope you found it interesting? I have. And thanks for joining us. Goodbye. Doctor, we're now, Doctor , we now have no appointments for the rest of the week. Would you maybe do a surgery on Thursday morning? Oh aye, aye, sure. Instead of going out with .

Cheerio now. Bye bye. Good morning. Good morning. Well now, what were you doing ? Ah. This pain in my back, Is the dry rot getting further in do you think? It is. And it's coming down my shoulder to my hand. Aargh. And erm my head's fuzzy you know. It's like bells in my ears. Right. This catarrh, I don't know I think it's catarrh. Aha. It's in there. Spitting. And I get into kinks, coughing Right. to get it up. Right. And it makes me . Sometimes I cannot get the cough out. And I'm coughing like, it's coughing. You know like, is Like the whoop? whooping cough? Like the whooping cough? Right. Now now. And erm I get a letter back, I'm getting the Attendance Allowance. Mhm. Have not got it yet, but Yeah. Och aye. So the, with this it's the only thing I've got. with this changing the rules, about eighteen months ago, Aha. they're giving away money. Mhm. Can't can't get rid of it fast enough. Can't get rid of it fast enough. Now, let's get a wee listen to the back of this chest to see if you ? Are you going to take my blood pressure today? Mhm. I haven't had it taken Sure. for October, I think, when I was up at the hospital and it was down not I was below. Whoops! Sod it! Not Pressure is alright. Up in the hospital the girl Ah. told me it was down. Och,heat. You don't want to listen to what these women tell you. . And that's a hundred and seventy, which is what you would expect for your age. A hundred and seventy over eighty. Mm. It can't be any better than that. Can't be any better than that . I thought that maybe what was making me feel a bit dizzy? No. No. No? No. No. Not that. Not that, that's as near perfect as Also most people get. It's near perfect, it makes no difference. N never been perfect Aye. in your life, but you're nearly perfect you're nearly perfect now. Right. Let's stop with this and this for you as well. Now I've given you er a tablet to take Mary, it's the, it's a one that they've used in fact down at the Pain Clinics, these special Pain At the what? The Pain Clinic, at the, at the Monklands and at the Royal. Mhm. Now, there's a stuff in it that'll help to dry up the catarrh as well. Mhm. You'll feel the inside of your mouth dry up. My mouth's awful dry and my lips and Yes. That's right. Right. and I thought I'd Yeah. I thought I knew, I knew with it I couldn't wear my bottom teeth all week because of the ulcers right beside near the bottom of my gum. Right. right. That's . Fed up with myself not being well. Oh, you get yourself looking at yourself. Indeed. Mm. Indeed you do. You get fed up working at the cos you have no day in it . But er, no, definitely not your blood pressure causing any problem That's good. Mary, no. No, cos I'm taking the faithfully. Yes. Och aye, it's definitely nowt to do with that. Now what about? Are you using any of your ? No. I've got, you gave me some last time and I'd got them the week before, so I've got enough. So you've got enough in the house just now, Mary, I right? I would like er a prescription ? Aye. I've got the spare tablets but I mean getting the prescription. Aye. Well as long as you've got enough to keep you going, that's that's Mhm. the main thing. But there's no terrible worries Hey? no terrible worries. You're gonna live for a wee while yet. Thank you . Aye. My grandson asked me the other morning, when was I gonna die? Oh, I'll tell you, it doesn't make me feel good or . You should've told them Oh. ten years on Friday. Ten years on Friday. Right Mary. Thanks very much. Right. Cheerio now. Cheerio. You don't need to be against that wall Tom. Ooh Make sure you've got lots of space because you know what you're like, you need lots of space don't you, for yourselves? Nice and comfortable. Now P C knows that I've got this smashing class. And they are a really nice class P C Are they? We don't know the gentleman's name with the tape recorder This gentleman is Tony Tony. Tony. Tony. Shall we say hallo? Hallo Tony. Hallo. Right, now then. So this is a very special project now, okay? Really special, and you are going to do your bit and you know P C well enough to do your bit. Okay? Mm. Right Tony's come here and he's gonna tape recorder everything that's says, that is said, your voice, my voice, so we want it all nice and properly done because er they're all gonna make a special project out of it, reference to spoken word and the written word so you must ask your questions nice and clearly, yeah? Yeah. You've all got questions, yeah? Yeah. Because we've got twenty five minutes but twenty five minutes can either drag or can fly by. Let's see if we can make the twenty five minutes fly by, yes? Oh these are a nosy lot aren't you? Eh? Good. Alright then. Ready to start? Yeah. Right, let's go. First question. How do you train a a police dog? How do you train a police dog. Right. Before you can become a police er dog handler Yeah. you have to do two years in the police force anyway, you then have to show some kind of application towards it. You are then go on a course and you are selected. If you are selected to go on another course, you are introduced to your dog. That's down in er Kent somewhere, I've forgotten where it is but it's down in Kent. While you're there you have thirteen weeks down there, which is like three months, with th with the dog. If you pass the course down there with your dog, yeah? You are then sent back to your force which is a which will be the Essex Police because I'm a member of the Essex Police. Alright? You then work with your dog the whole time and all the time you're working with your dog, naturally enough, it's a young dog, so you're being tested and evaluated the whole time, so your training continues. But initially you have to show a skill, or some kind of application, to be a dog trainer. You go away for thirteen weeks on a course with the dog, you're introduced to the dog you're gonna work with, yeah? Yeah. And if you pass that test you go back to your police force and you are evaluated and having tests all the time. Well that's how they train them, they train them in er what they call public order work, in the case of chasing people and all that, they also have tracking and all kinds of things, okay? Mm. Is that i does that answer your question? Yeah. Alright. How many of you have seen policemen wor Shh shh have you seen policemen working with dogs? Yeah. Would you What do you think? What do you tell P C that you've seen? What did you see? I've seen What did you see Nigel? I suppose erm I went to this club, went to this club with erm dogs showing erm tracking down er Tracking people down? Yeah, tracking people Burglars. Burglars, yeah. Was you, was er everyone in this class here when a gentleman by the name of erm Steve brought his dog here? Yeah. Oh that's when we saw Do you remember? Yeah. Yeah well what class are you in now? Mr Now what, what, how long, how many years have you been here, this class? Er three years. Five. Five. Five years? Yeah You may have been in they may been in the infants when Ooh think Who can remember that police dog coming here? Yeah? Well he's still working but cos that dog's a lot older, and a lot more grumpier they can't take the dog to the schools any more. He's not so, he doesn't like it coming to schools any more. He's a, he's a bit like an old man now, slightly bit grumpy. Well I hope I've answered that question. Next question. How do you become a policeman? How a group and not just a collection of separate offices. Er this of course will then improve the quality of the service which our customers receive. You'll have been briefed, I'm sure, about the two day management get-together that we're gonna have at Scarborough next week. All the function heads, most of the section engineers, all the team quantity surveyors and a good number of er senior project engineer, M S three type levels are gonna be there. I, I don't know how we're gonna get Bob's fishing rod on the train I'm a little bit worried about it but erm Get Bob on the . getting him off the dodgems perhaps will be a bigger problem. Er the reason for the get-together is for us to look closely at the aspirations of the group within the immediate future, and taking us forward three to five years. Three to five years seems quite a long way forward in the current uncertain climate. But we've called the er the seminar, Shaping the Future. And I think you can rest assured that the quality systems will be the foundations onto which we will build any changes which are identified as being necessary, as part of next week's get-together. Without quality systems in place, we won't be able to tender in the future for design work which a lot of our clients will be offering. It was only because we had the quality systems in place, okay we didn't have accreditation er at the time, but the quality systems were in place, that we were invited to tender for the Crossrail project for Rickmansworth station. So again, everything comes back to quality and the C E D G being er essential a a and really er a building block for our future survival. Okay . Would it be alright if I stayed for the rest of the afternoon? I think actually Trev that was very very timely, cos that really sort of encapsulated what we said this morning, so thank you very much for coming back. Er You might have to find your own chair actually. Oh right. I can stand at the back . Right erm wh what we propose doing now i is just to, I've written up er your, inverted commas, answers o on the board. Erm we'll just er look at th those have a good bit of a laugh and a bit of a chuckle. Erm the idea then is to, to swap your project quality plans around the groups and then for each, the leader of each group to critique those plans, just briefly, a few minutes er and present that to the erm t to the group. And hopefully that will stimulate some discussion. Right. So tho those are the estimates of cost. Er they range from, sorry can you see that? They range from eight thousand two hundred and fifty pounds through to eighteen thousand one hundred and fifty. Erm I shall pass no comment on those, but I do know whose was the lowest bid. And we said it would be. Erm Cheapskate. It's only because your boss is here, isn't it Bill? Erm issue of drawings to the er the client er the client wished to know, wished to know this. Er three of you told him when he was going to get it. Erm it's perhaps en encompassed in that which is the total completion er for the fourth group. And you also told the client er two of you told him when he was going to get the estimates. Erm Er again can you just alter the third one to the thirty first of August ninety three? Sorry. Which one? That one. That one you had your pen on. That's three is it? Sorry. Beg your pardon. I was doing it under the covers you see? Erm so er I mean it could be argued that those figures go in there. I'm a a and they're not too bothered about that. Erm group number one offered to advise the client when he 'd when they'd finished the survey. Not too sure you would actually do that without erm,I , I've got no real comment on that i quite so simply Okay Dennis? Yeah. What I'd like is ? Not yet. Because we're going to wait till you've s till er you're present . We're going to wait till er we've heard your critique on each other 's until we make our minds up. We'd like groups one and two to swap for comment please, and gr and groups three and four to swap for comment. Now could you get together and spend five or six minutes as a group, having a look at the other group's presentation and could you please make a note of the following. The good points, the points you disagree with completely, but most importantly of, of all, would you have been able to have worked from that particular quality plan as presented to you? In other words, was the quality plan sufficiently well completed for you to be able to utilize it? In earnest? So if you could just spend five or six minutes doing that and could we come back at twenty five past two please. Okay? for me?young lady. from there. from the end. You're as bad as . Yeah. We're running. Testing testing. early on. Right. Have w have we got one then? What's that? Right. Right. Do you wanna? Is it group four's erm plan? No it's not group four cos they'll all escape. Group four. Yeah. Er so Yeah. Let's, can you see that Roger ? So they've got the project number Toytown. no problem there. Er we I can't remember if we be an R O R O W one? Yeah. R O W's a bit odd. That one's misleading Mhm. for a kick off. Do you want to make a note of that? Mm. And extension varies by designs. Erm Not R O W. Alistair erm he's, he's made himself er he has made himself coordinator. And section engineer. And section engineer. I didn't sign it as coordinator. Mm. Project engineer is Brian . Right. No problem there really. that one. Have they got all the sections filled in? Didn't notice. Survey? It would be sent back if it wasn't filled in wouldn't it? Survey is all we said wasn't it? Mm. Yeah. We haven't got some of our headings . No. Er project manager. Yeah the same trouble as er We just put today's date on which is fair Yeah. enough isn't it? Yeah. IBIS I didn't notice. Did you? They've made that up I think. Mhm. Mm. O Eight Nine Eight isn't it? IBIS numbers One O Two Double O. Mhm. Survey of design. Er th they should have done the estimate Thirty percent. got thirty estimates there. Now then ? Good man. That's against what, sorry? Er project remit. Project remit. Well they've written it in but they haven't ticked it. They haven't got any specification laid out. Alright. So Mm. affect that. Shouldn't they tick this box? N erm Oh I see what you mean. Yeah. fill ours out . Specification. Well we did because we said we'd have to specify what to . They'll produce design drawings and thirty percent estimates er one and a half miles of train line. One down , one mile on the up, double junction below twenty mile an hour speed limit. Agreed that. up. diverting and land purchase negotiations . Yeah. W we did exactly er We, we, we just sort of noted it on there Mm. and there. Er now then They haven't got er meeting, anything about wh er A weekly report. No repo no mention of a report No. reporting Yeah. at a at any intervals. No. Ah. Right. Let's have a little look here. All they've done here is done liaison with the S and T. I would have thought that was really irrelevant. Since we know what the speed is. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Er that is, is valid. But erm no reference to locating services Mm. which will want to know. N no er reference to access and land ownership which we need to know for the survey. W we w we would need to know and be involved in locating services. Our works bridges responsibility statement not completed. Yeah. That's . Works bridges responsibility statement not completed. Yeah. Ownership we would want to er erm mm. No milestone dates quoted. No milestone. And er project meetings not allowed for. No allowance project meetings. Mhm. And theirs was nearly twice the price of ours. They just added their Er I think they, they were a bit more my, my gut feeling on this what it would cost somewhere around about twenty five grand Mm. er to honest. That er it in actual fact and I'm gonna hold you lads to all this. Erm Yeah. Erm No cross-sections. No cross-sections. Right. Erm This is on the project quality plan now is it? Only one longitudinal section drawing, it would b it would be a big one. Yeah. But we need ? Yeah. That'll be, we, we sort of weighed up from the length of what we had to show Mm. and we, we reckoned er alright. they've shown their certificate of er compliance. Won't argue about that, we didn't. Okay. Not much really There's a lot of technical work supervision in there. My God. Mm. Maybe they're allowing thousand six hundred hours? It seems that, that seems a lot. Do you agree? Yeah. Hell of a lot. Yeah. Query. Is that just for supervision? Not the actual technical work itself? That's just supervision or does that mean the technical work and supervision? Well I think we should query this. This is on appendix D two one. Er technical supervision, query two thousand six hundred hours. Which is nearly a year. Mm. Two thousand six hundred two thousand six hundred hours? Well it's over a year a on er working days. That's at ten hours a day. How many hours did we put down for working on ? Two thousand six hundred at twenty pound an hour? How long did we say for the survey? A week each? That's . Yeah. Oh no, two weeks wasn't it? Yeah. It's cos it's er The thing is should have been nearly seventy five hundred. We've got five hundred down for That's right. One fifty and two sixty two seven five O. right surely. But if that's hours Seems a seems a lot. That must be DOPACS units. Well Ah. possibly. But a again erm Because An hour far too much. if you were, if you add two thousand seven hundred and fifty hours at twenty pound an hour you'd be well over eighteen thousand. Yeah. So th th are the are these DOPACS units then? Yeah. I think they must be. Mm. Oh right. Mm. Yeah. That means the survey comes out roughly at what we estimated . Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Er Okay then. Right. That's that explained. Well they, they've put the thirty estimates er thirty percent estimates in there. That we, we just showed them over here, apart from that th their format's the same. Yeah. These are DOPACS units. Mm. Mm. Can you see where the escalation is c in cost is? Ah. Right. They've got earthworks. Earthworks in. That's, that's for a start. And photographs. And photographs. Yeah. But they're not supposed to include it. Er if they'd kept it separate. Don't liaison between Yeah. It's Yeah. So if you take fifteen hundred off then that erm It was eighteen thousand I think it was more or less. Plus sixteen. Plus photo plus photographs and they've seventeen fifty really . We have. So er we've sort of er beaten it down at bit. points . Well there is there is a particular section for the photographs I think we've figured that one out actually. Oh have you? Er which is that? Yeah. They're on . They have lot of technical work supervision . Two seven fifty divided by sixty three. What's that? It's about three weeks isn't it? That's a hell of a lot more than we put in didn't we? Yeah. Didn't we put er ten percent Yeah. of the job in didn't we? Yeah. We put a couple of days in I think in total. Yeah. That's where it's bumped up Norman. It's er i erm tho those are DOPACS units, so if we e if we er divide by Well it's two hundred and something and a . Now what was it? It was three hundred and fif three and sixty five DOPACS units? About a week isn't it? Seventy five seventy threes? Three six five isn't it. Yeah. Three six five a week so Erm Erm Wh what's that? Six weeks roughly. Eight weeks. Eight weeks near enough isn't it? Yeah. Eight weeks. No. That's totally over the top isn't it really? Mm. But that er technical supervision seems very high. Which form's that on? That's on er Project plan D Five Eight. D D Five Eight. It's prog er Technical work supervision. And he's got eight weeks. Mm. They've got too many . I've put all the er the grades in the wrong way round. They haven't done any or work operation checks. I started with highest worked on to the lowest. Ah. Is that on . Is that on another sheet? They haven't allowed for any Fees are . Detailed design. That's the one. Th they've got that Right. there. It's a pity we've not got a copy of our own. Mm. So what have we got Adam? Right. These are the points that we disagree on. Erm on the main header document, not R O Double O. Form D One, the project remit, no thirty percent estimates . No mention of any reporting. Works and bridges responsibility statement not completed. As well for the . Also no project meeting . And the project quality plan there's no cross-section drawings. Are you nearly ready? Yes. Okay. Don't what the good points were we haven't said any yet. And on extra works supervision . No. We haven't. single good point about it. Erm Well basically Yeah. Yeah. It's realistic. The writing was good. Yeah. Oh did we have a look at that? Good point . It was okay. tape stops and starts) Okay. Might I remind you please that when you're speaking into the group could you try and speak up a little bit because we've still got the tapes going. And er this young lady, Clare's terribly interested in the way in which we're using our language today, so er I hope that doesn't inhibit you. Right. Group three. Could we please have your comments? Er group three. We're commenting on er er group four's erm er quality plan. Erm we don't see a great deal of difference that they've had the same problem as we've had, in that we ran out of time before we could put the er finished act together properly. Er so we've started off with a number of relatively nitpicking erm erm points. For instance the title we thought R O W was Toytown station, R O W was misleading cos b R O W stands for Renewal Of Way. Probably doesn't describe the project er correctly. Erm on the second sheet form D One the er erm thirty percent estimate box hadn't been ticked. Er there was a fairly comprehensive er specification. Erm in some ways more erm comprehensive than one that we provided. I i but missing out items that er that we'd shown. Erm also there was no er reference to er the er er frequency of reports at the bottom of the er bottom of the sheet. Er which er I suspect was due to the th the insufficient time to carry out the exercise. On the second sheet er of D One, the responsibility statement, er there were just a couple of boxes er ticked. Erm liaising with the operations manager route speed potential, since we know the route speed is twenty miles an hour, er I felt that probably wasn't really a vital item. On the other hand I would have ticked s erm location of services er and public and utility because th these are things that we need to know at the design stage. Likewise obviously for land and access, because we will need to know that for the survey work involved. Erm most of the other items o on the works and bridges would have been the responsibility of the project manager to er them. But those two in particular we felt that er we would do that as part of our er a an essential part of what we were trying to design. Er there's no, no milestones dates er er quoted but these of course have been given so they have been considered. Erm number of projects meetings er wasn't er wasn't completed, and the boxes at the bottom er but er planning permission was erm ticked as a constraint er I wondered what the basis was behind that, for ticking it? Right. So that was the er the access t plan. Right. Okay. Erm on the er process check list, erm a difference from ourselves which does the affect the price of group three, which we purposefully left out, they have quoted er a price for a soils investigation. Er we left that out because of Dennis' assurance that it was just our costs, but these are, this is certainly something that we would have to er add to our cost. And er also incidentally a cost for the P Q S, because the P Q S would do estimates for the earthworks th that are involved which is outside our normal line of duty. Er so that's an item included that we didn't have on ours. I wouldn't er b just at a brief gla glance I didn't er agree with the er drawing schedule. It's quite different from ours. We saw ourselves as having to do erm a considerable number of cross-sections for calculating, or enabling the P Q S to calculate earthworks quantities. We had no assurance of the ground between Road and Toytown as flat. So a w we saw cross-sections as being the big item here, whereas er Alistair's team er didn't er didn't see it as such. Erm on the er er project plan D Five P, erm without having our own to compare with, a bit difficult to do, again o the e the fifteen hundred for earthworks investigations included which we haven't included. There's also a very valid item for photos which we hadn't included. Two hundred and fifty pounds er which certainly would be er done. The o only thing that we felt w we could take issue on was on the project resource sheet, erm technical work supervision. There was erm a total of two thousand six hundred units allocated to Brian which we thought was er a bit steep. three and a half hours of work . Mm. three and half of his time . Erm but if you translate that into er er into days it's quite a substantial amount and er erm again in our plan we'd thought in terms of a complete MOS design er where the input would be probably more on the checking side, than actual on the, actually on the supervision. Cos you can see from our price that anticipating very a rapid er a very rapid completion. So really there's only that item w w we felt that particular one was a bit er a bit steep and er the rest was er a a difference in emphasis, I would suspect, coupled with shortage of time Was it, was it a workable plan as it stood ? Er yes. Good.. Yeah. A a subject to er th the I think my main objection to it would be that the lack of reference to cross-sections, which on you without knowledge of the ground could or could not be viable. . Well you got quite a lot out of being able to evaluate . as a project engineer or team member or one of the troops doing the job, if you were presented with that, you could have done what you'd been asked to do? As far as we can judge in five minutes, yes. Yes. That's . Gro group two, would you like to tell us about? there's a shortage of actual evaluating . Erm the quality project plan needs filling in erm certainly with I c couldn't with that. Erm and again the second sheet, form D One erm the fine details erm and the er the remit er gave a reasonably adequate to work to . Er the C E G responsibility statement form D One erm er erm bypassed that, by writing er a rider on that they assumed concept will be agreed for surveying er feasibility. Er and that the with er nothing more than to get on and do it . I think some of the erm er they've crossed all the P Way ones out and er appear not to have crossed any of the works, bridges, B E S out. Er they tried to write a rider to bypass it completely, but I don't know whether that is sound . I think maybe they should have perhaps covered certain . Erm the process check list erm again they've identified the people on each erm and within that they've actually nominated people to look at the land ownership which is the, on the ignored with their rider on the previous sheet. Er but again nominate people erm to do the different works. Erm they haven't quantified the number of drawings to be done. Erm again it's a question of time I'm sure they would have been probably reasonably er adequate. Er the project resources sheet erm again th th the erm it's identify erm the quantities do seem about right. Erm there's, they haven't added up one of the boxes, and I believe that in terms of erm its actual cost. Er and that query made on how they are going to actually evaluate the plan. Erm once they've they've gone off this sheet and it's been transferred incorrectly to the project plan and the price of the plan. Er but the plan itself the DOPACS units haven't been actually completed and therefore they could be running at a loss . Erm the actual form D three five erm bar chart was filled in with er milestone dates and nominates people. And again some of them have different values of units. Er within the erm procedural responsibility statement th there's no milestones mentioned er form D three five. So what, what you're saying But really o overall er the plan looks reasonably sound except for the which er reflect in the price . I could work to it. But what we also said tha that's quite encouraging, John, is that there is an ability to crosscheck the costing that you've achieved with the information previously entered onto these other forms. In which case er given a little bit more time to fill the thing in, Yeah. erm there i it's not just a matter of plucking a figure out of thin air, but you can see the justification for the full fee-bid, and you can er crosscheck the accuracy of the fee-bid as well. Yes.. Good. Right. Group er one please. What comments have you got ? Erm group one commenting on group two. Sheet one was er as we wha what was expected. No problems with that. We were a little unsure ourselves whether were actually doing scheme work or design. Er we always think we do a little scheme work within design. But whatever er it's difficult to on, on that. Erm form D One, the pink one, er there was no reporting timescales, weekly intervals er or whether they were going to report on completion. Erm and that is or could be the only approach to the client once the job starts, so we thought it was fairly important. Erm works, bridges, B E S subjects, as John rightly said, we missed out erm one or two of these and tended to ignore the things that were under works, bridges and B E S. Er and as John said, one or two of them were probably relevant and we didn't make er notes on those. Erm and, and and, and probably those points are erm of interest and some of them er will have to be taken into account. Er there was no constraints erm within the project or within the responsibility statement on saying that somebody else should be responsible for certain things that we felt were outside our, our remit. Erm obviously . The quality plan, erm a lot of ticks, but no names, apart from the detailed design drawings and I, we thought that the quality plan, the idea was to pin somebody down to being responsible for each actual item erm . Yes. What really we thought was the idea of this to pin them down into er in who was doing it and when. Er and we thought that there should have been initials against every item that was ticked. Erm t just to er well there was a l a certain lack of time on this thing, I mean, Dennis had to come round and tell us to start our tick-list else we weren't gonna . Er and if he'd of walked up to John two minutes later he probably wouldn't have made it because we had a right erm but we did feel there had to be some initials. Even if we made somebody's up. Erm getting down to the project re resource sheets er Jack w we felt that even though our bid was fairly low, even a adjusted for a full calculation. Now we, we did feel that erm the difference between our bid an and erm the team two bid, was mainly down to erm correspondence and project en administration. That in fact we were looking at almost two months' work erm for project engineering, when in fact that scheme would have been condensed down into project engineering. Erm then correspondence two hours for two people. Erm client reports again, technical work supervision there was a lot of time a and we just felt that erm for a full year. That's right. The longer it That's, that's, but, but actually if they look at the DOPACS times, for the people doing the work, the surveyors and the designers, they can do their work in two months which is spread out over a year. Now spreading it over a year means that the project administration jumps dramatically, and there's about four, five thousand pounds' worth in there. Er and we felt that was a bit excessive. Erm No fighting gentlemen. Well No but forty hours is about er fifteen . Don't don't worry too much about Okay. Whatever we just we just felt that we were probably very mean on our project administration. That we didn't want to put too many people on the back of the people actually doing the work. And we felt that team two have gone the other way,tha that the work spread out and actually when you looked at the, at the project plan at the back, erm that in fact a surveyor was out for six hundred and eighty three DOPACS units which is about ten days and that had spread all through May, June and July. Erm there was no start date for him and no finish date for him really er considered what the resource . Yeah. That's right. This takes no account of priorities, other works within the section, whether in fact this doesn't need doing until nin early ninety four. Er and so what John's done, he's suggested that in fact if it comes for March ninety four, that he spread the work out till nineteen ninety four which may be the sensible attitude cos people can make those decisions of the schemes to involved. If you do the work early somebody changes their mind as soon as you've finished. But er it would have to be a client discussion, about when he actually wanted the contract completing. But spreading the work out though actually extended the administration costs and not giving start and finish times that were fairly tight, so the people doing the work allowed them to make their own judgments on when it was going to be done. And that things would tend to drag on to the last minute and then they would start and then it would it go forward. And the work would then be completed to approximately the same timescale that we, that we deadlined on the . Er we thought, we thought that the scheme was, the, the sheet was filled in properly er a apart possibly from the, the er initials as we suggested, putting people down on the quality plan, which was obviously down to timescales. Er we thought we could work to it and we thought we had a different rule for timekeeping er and we didn't check the calculations. Well it seems to me that there was obviously enough information in that plan for you to be able to understand very very clearly what, what was wanted and what was going to be done. And I think that's really quite important. And th that's quite encouraging Mm. that, that the group you were assessing managed to do that. We've got one, one last group. Have you any comments on that David? Erm Dennis? Before we go on to group four? Erm No. Right. Group four, have you got all your people still here? Or have they Yeah. escaped? Yeah. No actually i working out punch-line for the joke. Er cos that's why we're so expensive when you lose a few engineers in transit. Erm Literally in transit. In transit. Yeah. Er commenting on group three's erm plan. Really I think at the end of the day it's very similar to, to ours, although the price difference is a bit different. Erm the remit er the client details and the remit's pretty detailed, I think it spells out what should be done. I think the only comment I would have on there is we spelt out specifically what we thought the project manager should be responsible for in the actual remit stages itself. Although Norman's actually ticked that the project manager was gonna be responsible for certain things I think it's one of these things that need to be brought out. Fairly importantly that we're gonna do this, but you've gotta do this. I think I see one problem with, we've put site investigation and flagged the price I think, whereas if we'd said that we require site investigation work to be undertaken by the project manager, we've really got to decide the level of site investigations, so that in the first instance we've gotta approach the soil mechanics and determine from them what, what we need from them. So the, really the foreman's gotta get that price. It's a matter of then where you put that price, either in our fee or invoice directly to the, to the client. But again obviously that doesn't apply but that's what has gotta be done. Again we got into time constraints, there was one or two things obviously that weren't filled in, but I think that's only been nitpicking I think at the time. Obviously has ticked off erm quite a lot of work that the project manager is gonna be responsible for on here, really. Here on the responsibility reference statement. Er it might very well be that the project manager may think, well my God, am I gonna do more work than the engineers that are working with you. So that the split may well have been that er he was gonna to do a lot more work than perhaps the er civil engineering design group. So perhaps a lot of the times but I would have maybe suggested that, that we could have done and presented that as part of the package. So again perhaps tied in our prices, it might be that we've assumed that we'd do more, perhaps than the other groups. So overall . Number of meetings, although we hadn't ticked the box, we had flagged up exact same number as ten, ten sets of meetings, erm six liaison and four technical. Erm milestones, yeah, pretty similar I think really. They were all durations. As a sort of bridge person I was quite interested to find out how different the works, the, the, the Permanent Way office does the structural things and er obviously all the clients have feared that this resources would be thrown perhaps . Maybe three lads to the drawings and maybe two lads to do the calculations, whereas it would be slightly in the bridge office or the works office because of the present resource availability, it tends to be that you only have a smaller number of people doing, doing those tasks. But again, obviously if the resources are there why not use them. Yeah, I think obviously, Norman has put down that he's gonna produce quite a lot of cross-section, I think that's a valid point I think we had assumed, perhaps incorrectly, that the ground was gonna be relatively level. But er they might have been assumptions that we shouldn't have made. Erm I think looking through the actual resource sheet itself, I think we had more project administration time down, and certainly that we had more technical work supervision and you put more of an emphasis on, of actually looking after the lads. There is only, well there are sixteen hours that er that Norman's put down for the total technical work supervision on the job, I would have thought that perhaps that might be quite tight, er you know bearing in mind that it's maybe a job that requires a to the remit. Erm I, I'd initially put a a great big cross through all of that. I know absolutely nothing about P Way but then as Norman was speaking, I realized that perhaps I could put a few ticks in. And it might be that what we've got to do is t is to change that to perhaps include P Way. I think we need a bit more discussion on this. Erm the key dates have to be here as well as on the D Five, cos this forms part of the appointment contract to the client. We're saying to him, we will supply this service on a, by a particular date. He wishes to know that and we will record our progress against it. Erm clearly state any exclusions erm er the moving, diverting the footpath for example. Clearly state that, we're assuming that you are going to divide er divert the footpath, we're not going to to. I think what you have to remember is that these three sheets er are in fact, well w what we have to remember is that the business manager is an internal client, and that these three sheets are something to him, or to her, to type to form the appointment contract, so therefore let's get it right. Erm and you were saying earlier Mike, that this in effect is an, an internal contract and you have a nice little story about some initials behind someone's desk, which you'd Mm. perhaps like to repeat. Is it repeatable in front of a, a microphone? Well sorry. . Later. Yeah. Effectively what we've got here is the mechanism whereby the client requirements are sent to the people who are actually going to do the job on the drawing board. It's an internal type of contract. If there are any problems then we should be able to say to ourselves, well let's go and have look at the project quality plan, what's that tell us? And if we've got the project quality plan right there shouldn't be any problems or queries and it did remind me of this Australian er project manager, who I've mentioned to one or two other people over lunch, who used to sit in a great, a great office, running multimillion pounds' project and when people came in to complain to him, he used to refer them to the plaque on the wall which said R T F C. Read the fucking contract. Effectively, what we've got here is a similar internal message. And so it's very important to get this completed really well tt because then there shouldn't be too many queries later on. So that will do, Dennis. . Erm just a couple of points here,th this form is one of positive identification, that there is no need to do anything with the boxes that you're not going to touch. Erm in other words someone is responsible for drawings therefore you would, you'd put the initials in there. Erm we're not gonna get involved with mine-workings, for example, nothing appears there. Positive identification. Erm I think for some reasons Trudy we so a rogue in there, bridge assessment records, I applies to P Way. Erm Erm It may do. It may do. I mean steps and things like that. It might do? Ah sorry. Well I stand corrected. project . I told you I know nothing about er P Way. Erm category of checking, one of those b the idea would be to ring either the double nought or the nought. Erm self-checking, as we mentioned before, self-checking i is permiss permissible. Er if you've got a competent p person that you trust preparing the estimate, they can check it themselves. It doesn't have to be checked by someone else, it doesn't have to be an independent check, unless the regulations demand it. Which I don't think in estimating they do. Er certainly the works office, there's no reason why you shouldn't draw, do a drawing and check the drawing yourselves. It's quite permissible provided you trust the person and that person the necessary skills. Weekly reports and things we've, we've mentioned before. Erm the purpose of the two columns, and I think we've missed this out, is, is that we should be identifying how many w w whether we're using er going to produce drawings by hand or by CAD. Erm and I could thi think of no other er quality measures necessary to meet the er quality objectives apart from bringing your sandwiches. I suggest you might bring a sandwich along Paul. The point I want to get across here is that this a P Way form, it is your form, not my form, not the Q A form, it's the P Way form for you to use and to change to the way that you want it to change. Erm I don't, and similarly with that form, forget the details, that again is a P Way form for you, it's your form, you change it. I'm not interested. This one again, that is a P Way form, erm the only person who's interested in that is Trevor and his organization, so if you want that changing, agree it with Trevor. And that really is all I need to say unless you've got any questions? I think er Granville can field er any questions when he does his spot after coffee then, Dennis. I thought he might go, he might do it now and we go for coffee . Oh! Oh dear . Okay, let's have a break er if you can come back reasonably quickly er we can make up a few seconds. do it quietly. Right. You've In case anybody doesn't know me, I think I've had dealings with most people here, but my name's Granville . And I'm a project engineer within the works design group. Hopefully this morning you've now been introduced to the concept of quality planning, as it's intended within the civil engineering design group. I trust the exercise you've just a carried out has at least given you an insight into the format and use of this document. But what are the advantages? As a project engineer, I've been using a similar document for about the last six months. Its format has changed over that time, quite a bit, because like any quality system, it's subject to constant review. And as Mike referred to this morning, there are ways and means, if there's items in here that need amending and improving, there are ways and means that you can do it. But throughout all that time the principles contained within the document have always cha remained the same. If we go back a few years, I don't know how many people remember before we had DOPACS, I remember when projects used to come into the group from on high, they used to filter through the organization, until they landed on somebody's desk who was actually supposed to carry out the work. At best he maybe had a letter from the client, that letter had gained copious notes as it filtered its way through the hierarchy, some helpful, some intelligible, unintelligible should I, should I say, and some contradictory. You may have then had a verbal exchange with your next in line, but bar that you were expected to get on with the work. And then we had that introduction of DOPACS, and all that changed. And I ask the question, or did it? True, projects can now come into the organization at any level. True, we have written remits. But by their very nature they are only a few lines on a piece of paper at the moment. The final recipient has still got to get on with the work based on this small amount of information, only now with DOPACS he has a time limit. And that time limit, or DOPACS units, in the past has always been a wee bit nebulous. It's been based on jobs we've done for clients in the past, based on pla past experience. We've never in the past looked in detail at the total work content to work out these time units, after all in the past, we've known what the client wants, we've been giving him it for years. But now, as you're probably all aware, this has changed. The railway is now business and client orientated, the work content that we go into, is decided by their requirements and not what we would like to give them. You've now all seen a project quality plan, but I'd just like to go through a few of the headings just to advise you where I think the benefits lie. We start off with the front cover sheet. This categorizes the stage of the work, feasibility, scheme, design. Which immediately identifies the scope of the work required. It also sets down the project team, encompasses all the functions involved within that scheme, thus ensuring that early contact is made between all individuals. The lead project engineer is named, who is then responsible for the day to day running of the project. But the project coordinator retains an overview at review meetings. Inside the front cover are the project details, which is a form D One we've all seen and used before. It sets out the agreed remit, including any constraints. This remit is agreed with the client, by the project coordinator, who can be anyone within the organization but would normally be an experienced engineer. The project quality plan is then compiled between the project coordinator and the lead project engineer, based on this agreed remit. Also included under this heading are all the client details which enable an appointment contract to be prepared and forwarded. Now come some of the sections which you may not be so familiar with. We have the responsibility statement. This identifies exactly those areas of the project that the C E D G will be responsible for, within the terms of the appointment contract. Once agreed with the client it ensures that all relevant responsibilities are covered by either the C E D G, the project manager or the client. A copy of this statement is forwarded to the client and therefore no ambiguity exists. In the works one the main bulk of the project quality plan is the process check list. I note in the P Way it's only a page but the principles are still the same. This has proved the most useful as far I've been concerned and the works I've done in the works office. Cos it comprises a checklist encompassing the major requirements necessary to complete and the project and it helps to identify the processes involved, and the stage to which are to be taken, for the s for the successful completion of the project. Thus ensuring all items of work are taken into account, and none are overlooked or forgotten. It indicates the persons who are to carry out those aspects of the work, thereby defining person responsibilities. It also identifies the management procedures that should be followed to correctly complete the project in line with office requirements. The final item of the process checklist includes the necessary reports required to keep our clients informed of the progress, both physical and financial, of the scheme we're undertaking. So, therefore, right from the outset the project en the lead project engineer knows which ro reports are required, how many and when they are to be provided. Next we have the project resource sheet. This has been in use in the works office for some time, it was, it used to be called an aide-memoire. This summarizes the main processes and resources required to carry out that, this particular item of work. Having defined the processes in detail under the checklist, it now becomes much easier to allocate the necessary resources, time units, DOPACS units or whatever you like to call them, to successfully complete the project. The project resource sheet enables these units to be identified for each individual's activity within the project, thus ensuring a realistic fee-bid. The final page is the project plan, the D Five, of which I'm sure we're all familiar. The project resource sheet is so designed that once you've allocated the resources, it is now relatively easy to transfer those res resources over to the project plan. All that is contained within the project quality plan enables the project plan to be completed correctly and accurately. We all know it's extremely important that that project plan is as accurate as possible. Because once costed it represents the estimated fee for the group's involvement in a project, either in the form of an appointment contract for the client to sign. or as a fee-bid. It defines the project timescales and priority to enable individual workloads within the group to be planned through DOPACS, and it also important n needed-by dates, the milestones, within the project, which again through DOPACS enables checks on the physical and financial progress to be carried out at any time. To summarize. I believe that project quality plans are essential within our group to ensure we provide our clients with a cost-effective quality service. It also allows a consistency of standards and policy from all the functions within the group to our clients. By the use of project quality plans, we're ensuring that the following important criteria are fully considered and answered. The first criteria is, what? A clear and precise remit is obtained and documented. When? Needed-by dates, both within and on completion of projects, are again clearly identified. How? The depth and scope of work content is defined, allowing resource requirements to be accurately predicted. Who? Individual responsibilities at all levels are defined within this plan. And most important of all, how much? Ensures a realistic fee-bid based on all of the above. And if we can get all of those five right it helps all of us within the group to hopefully get it right first time. And if we get it right first time, we'll have a satisfied client who will hopefully return to us for more work. And that is the situation we're in, that's the name of the game, is to satisfy our clients and that is all project quality planning. Er I know Mike now goes off at slightly different subjects, so I would suggest if there are any questions, not only on what I've just said, but really what you've done this morning, the exercise, either myself, Dennis, or Mike, or Trevor could answer any questions? Stunned silence. Silence. Straight between the eyes. I think the problem with a clear remit I can't really come to terms with that, precisely,competitive . How do you know your competitors clear remit? Or do we tend to build things in because we've already done that type of job and we know the job and things in subconsciously where ? is to discuss wi with the client what it is that he what he said, what . He'll just say, well yes, yes. I would hope that in a competitive sense recognize the implications. I would hope that in a competitive situation i it is happening now un under a non-competitive situation, er the clients are giving us written remits erm and I think we'll be going further down the path. of the client to lead you on to perhaps you could introduce more elements into your actual remit diverted an and I accept . Yes. Th the remit though that, that we're actually putting down on the appointment contract, is actually the result of the negotiations between the project coordinator and the client. I in the past th Granville mentioned these letters that used to work their way down from on high which might have just been a,a bit of a twinkle in somebody's eye with no money at all to spend on physical work but even so it was given the same status within the R C E's organization of five or ten years ago a a as an investment item was, it was almost authorized. A and we tended to not bother going back to the client, but giving what we thought he needed, that was the culture of the regional civil engineer, Mm. if Brian didn't think we needed it then it didn't even get a lookout let alone er er resources allocated to it. Nowadays it's different, when a client comes to us and says, I need something here. If he doesn't know what he needs, that's great because we can help him a a and he's not gonna go somewhere else where he isn't going to get that help. But at the end of the discussions between the project coordinator and the client, when you have actually helped him and led along, you could have this, or you could have that, or perhaps we could just take it to this stage, cost some options out and give you a recommendation. Whichever you go, write down your interpretation of what you think you have agreed with the client and sign it and send it to him. If he signs it that indicates that he has accepted what you've jointly agreed, and then you've got something, a milestone, something to go back and measure yourselves against and to justify what you've done against erm the fees that, that you're invoicing the client for, if the client at s at some stage decides perhaps that's not really what he wanted after all. Er in a competitive situation, the Rickmansworth tender w w w was a,a an example of that, we actually had a contract document which is about as thick and complicated as one of the contract documents that we would put out for civil engineering physical work to er er a contractor. And we actually had to comply with certain clauses a a and provide method statements and It's got a hundred and fifty sheets in it. So it was written as a document. So if we're going into to this And what did the competitor have? If we go into this fixed fee competitive scenario, then we will insist that we are actually comparing apples with apples and not apples with pears,whe when the client looks at our fee and he looks at an external consultant's or another railway internal consultant's fee Yeah. I think that's the way we see it going and that's the way we hope it's going Yes. but just at the moment in P Way we feel that it isn't possibly going that way No. and yet a a a a and with And it one or two competitive tenders that have . That's all we're worried about. A a are writing the remit and then the remits aren't going out to the other competitors. Well if that's the case Bob, it's really the fault lies with our client not with us. Our client should be presenting us with a sheaf of paper with pink ribbon round it, saying, we would like a tender on that, fixed fee, by two weeks on Tuesday, or whatever. A a and by the way, you are in competition with a number of other organizations, both internal and external. They should be doing that work, if they're asking us to design a remit, price it and then they're using that remit to get prices from other people, er I would suggest that, that we perhaps ought to have words with our clients on that basis a and say we're quite happy to tender in competition but erm i you ought to give it a little bit of thought before you actually put the thing . . Erm I think it might be helpful if I make a comment on this business of er tenders from the other side of the fence actually, Bob. When I worked er for in the mid eighties, we had been through a period where we'd always taken the cheapest tender. Er for North Sea platform design and construction activities. We very quickly realized that the cheapest tender wasn't always the cheapest in the medium or long term,t to , but we weren't very quick to realize how to put that right . Because we had a tender board operation which said you take the cheapest tender. Eventually through reasonably correct bid evaluation, we began to learn how to cost out inferior bids, when we had a very very low bid in we could see that certain things had been skimped, certain things might even have been missed out completely, and we then began to cost the effect of that on the organization. But it did take some time. Now, I suspect that your industry, shall I put that in inverted commas, Bob? Has got to go through this learning curve to some degree. But I do see the project quality plan being extremely valuable because you will be feeding back the front part of the quality plan to the client and explaining the extras that you're going to do, or the constraints within which you're working. Now you cannot force the client to take that into account and read and understand it, but I do believe that it will be possible for you, in writing to the client, to explain the advantages and the extras which you are incorporating within your er proposed scheme which you feel are absolutely fundamental to the correct working of the project. In other words, they're not, they're not extras er in, in the absolute sense, they are necessary for that particular scheme, but they may be things which less erm experienced consultants might omit. And so there's a tremendous onus upon your good selves, to highlight the experience if you like and expertise you have of spotting problems, and explaining how you will get around then within the given fee-bid. I, I think that's, that's the most sort of optimistic comment I can make Bob, but it is a potentially fraught issue. I think, I think, yes. I think, I think all we're worried about is the transition period between Yeah. the, the in-house, friendly at atmosphere we've had up to now, er non-competitive, across to what we're gonna see in the future, in the future, which is competitive with a professional client giving a professional remit to a number of tenderers, which will be us. But in the meantime there is a very loose remit situation. And that's all we're worried about, this transition period, that we might lose clients within that. Put it like this, Bob, I don't think the project quality plan is going to hinder you. Oh no. If anything, I would believe very strongly, that a more systematic approach to this, a checklist for checking specific items off, will in fact help you, Yes. through this transition period, but there isn't a slick answer to your immediate problem. Yes. Th th the more, the better remit we write, if you like, in reply in our contract and the more erm Explanation? explanation and conditions we put on it, to say what we are and aren't going to do, the better. Erm it's just this transition period. Th th there is one point on the same vein as that Bob,th the second sheet on the D One, where there's a suggestion that we tick off additional bits that we're gonna put into our contract, we are going to arrange possessions,we we're gonna do this that and the other. We've gotta be careful that in er using that sheet, we don't do it in such a way as to bully and turn off the customer by saying, by the way, you'd better make sure you've done this, this, this, this and this, cos I'm not doing it. You know,i i it is a very fine line between er how we talk to our customers, which is why I, I, I can't stress enough the need for the project coordinators to talk face to face with the customer first of all, and perhaps gently lead him down some of the items in this list that the project coordinator thinks the client might not have remembered. Er a a and then say, well we can take that on board for you if you like but it might be more efficient for you to do the possessions because the civil engineer Leeds, actually is part of your organization a a and it might be more appropriate for you to get those possessions in, for you to decide whether or not you want one big bang o o o of a week's possession or, or you want to do it i in four hour no-trains periods for the next three years. That type of putting back into a business context, is something which er we need to help the business come to terms with while they are growing in this new scheme of procuring work in a more formal and structured way. I would actually like to emphasize that the qu quality plan is originally intended to help the people who are going to have to do the job at the coal face. However, I believe that there are advantages in improved communications with the client. If you er use the front part of the plan correctly and complete it well. Okay . County's Community Charge levels. Mr Portillo has been meeting with two leading Conservative Councillors from Oxfordshire to discuss the impact of the Poll Tax on the County. Conservative leader, David Walden, and Bloxham Councillor, Keith Mitchell, asked the Minister to bear in mind Oxfordshire's extra commitment to Social Services, the National Curriculum and increased expenditure on the County's roads. Conservative leader, David Walden, says they managed to convey the extent of the County's problems. We er emphasised to him the impact this would have on Oxfordshire's er spending requirements and er the hope that the er spending that we get, and we get it in two ways; one is through, called the standard spending grant, that is a general grant that was given to authorities to spend as they wish, and the other is a specific grants which are given for particular purposes, and some of them cover the legislation that I have mentioned, which we are required to spend specifically on the items for which they're given. Was Mr Portillo able to say categorically that ‘yes, Oxfordshire will benefit, next time the budget is planned’. He wasn't er able to be so positive as that, but he did certainly give us the impression that er that he'd listened very carefully to what we had to say. I think there were one or two er new items of information that he had concerning Oxfordshire which he didn't realise before, and he certainly gave us the impression that he would er, er take these into account when assessing the share out to Oxfordshire. I think we have to say that er I would imagine that plans are well advanced for the nineteen ninety/ninety one/ninety two settlement, er so it may not be immediately that er we will get the benefit of what we said to him. But we do have a measure of optimism that they might reflect themselves in further years like ninety two/ninety three and onwards. You're listening to the Fox Report. One of the country's top environmental pressure groups has published details of a survey which shows horrific pollution of lakes in Scotland and Scandinavia caused by acid rain. The National Society for Clean Air who've carried out the five million pound survey said power stations in Eastern Europe are the main cause of the problem. The Society's president, Sir John Mason, revealed the survey's disturbing findings, he says they prove acid rain is causing pollution far greater than anyone imagined. We found that in areas of Southern Norway and Sweden, and areas of Scotland where there are hard granite rocks and thin soils, that many of the lakes and streams have shown er a progressive acidification since the industrial revolution, and that this has accelerated in recent years, until about ten years ago, when er the emissions of So2 from the U K, particularly fell, about, between about nineteen seventy and er today of about thirty or fell forty per cent drop. And that's beginning to show er up in the chemistry of the lakes and streams, some recovery of some lakes are already recovering in response to that reduction of emissions, but not all by any means. So how much damage is that causing? Well quite a lot of the lakes and streams have lost their fish, of course that's the, that's the most important thing, between, particularly salmon and trout, and we have discovered that they are killed not so much by the acid, but by the aluminium which has leaked out of the soil by the acid water, the acid rain, and er that er the fish find this very hard to tolerate. They actually er attack the gills er surfaces of the fish so that they lose body salt. Whose power stations are causing this? Well, the er power stations all round the, Northern Europe are affecting it, as far as Norway and Sweden are concerned, er much of the pollution comes from Eastern Europe er and erm something like ten to twenty per cent comes from the U K as far as Norway is concerned, and five to ten per cent in Sweden. Er. In the, in the, in the U K of course, er and in Scotland, most of the acid deposition there comes from our own power stations. Do think the rest of us in, in, in the Western world have a duty to give them money to, to help sort out the pollution problem? I doubt whether we can afford it, I doubt whether, I think the problems are so immense, er what really means is down I think, tearing down most of their industry and rebuilding it from scratch. And er I don't know where the money would actually come from doing that. As far as East Germany is concerned, no doubt Western Germany will take care of that now, er who could or would be able to do it for Poland Czechoslovakia, Rumania and the Soviet Union, is very much more difficult to see, and of course, if the West were to rebuild all their, all their factories, er and they were all modern, and with their cheap labour force, they would then com, almost completely er destroy our industry I guess in competition so that we would have a, that would be another problem I guess. So there's really very large economic problems here. You're listening to the Fox Report. John Duan Fu Suan is a Roman Catholic priest who's in prison in Vietnam. Amnesty International are unhappy about the circumstances of his conviction and they're trying to find out more about it. Clare Middell is from Oxford's Amnesty International Group, Clare, how much do you know about this priest? Unfortunately very little, er we know he's been in prison since nineteen eighty seven and that he's been sentenced to ten years, but we haven't been able to determine er under what charge, what happened at his trial, whether he was given defence, er access to a lawyer, those kind of things, and er Amnesty believes that he's been er imprisoned for his beliefs. How did you come to find out about him? er Well it's been allocated to the Oxford Group and the Central Amnesty found its information through er government releases, the media in Vietnam and er people from, who've left Vietnam since. So what sort of thing can you do to try and get him released? We've er, at the moment we're in a campaign of letter writing where we've got er a body of people that regularly send out letters to er all the different government officials in Vietnam and to the Embassy in er London. Er. We're also circulating a petition round, anything that's trying to get the public awareness of it. Because it's, it, it can't be very easy to, to make contact with a, a regime like the Vietnam regime, I mean are you hopeful that it'll actually do any good? I'm very hopeful because er, Vietnam since nineteen eighty six has been under a process of economic and political reform, and they have released er a large amount of prisoners over this time, and there are still a number of prisoners, such as poets er religious people that are still in prison, who are hoping that, with their renewed effort and attention from the media, this'll er be changed. You say you don't know what he was convicted of; do you have any clues as to the sort of thing that it's likely to have been? Well it, it's likely to be of charged under one of the loose clauses of anti-government er activities which really could mean anything, and so there, it's more likely to be that, and if so, we have to look at the evidence then that was used to back up this claim. Have you had successes in the past using this method of, of trying to bring it to public attention? Yes, it has been very successful, it does depend on the country, but it, it does work. It's pretty heavy er clockwise on the M twenty five between junctions fifteen and sixteen, that's the stretch between the M four and the M forty. On the M forty itself between junctions four and five, that's the stretch between High Wycombe and Stokenchurch, it's down to two narrow lanes in both directions, with a contraflow system for a short stretch about midway between the two junctions, and at times, it's down to single line traffic. A thirty four between Botley and Hinksey Hill, you can expect delays southbound due to long term roadworks, and Banbury town centre, it's the Michaelmas Street Fair until Saturday, and that means there are various road closures and some traffic being diverted. Martin Lawford, A A roadwatch. And I've still no problems to talk to you about, about the buses or the trains. Still to come, on the Fox Report: Students from the newly reunified Eastern Europe, Eastern Germany, visit Oxford, and say ‘it wouldn't be a bad place to work’. I'm quite sure that er there are teachers from that part of Germany who would like to, to work in your country. You're listening to the Fox Report, it's six thirty one. Customs officers at Dover have made the biggest ever heroin seizure in Britain; it's sixty kilos with a street value of ten million pounds. The drug was found in a container vessel under a consignment of textiles. The government is dismissing doctor's fears that millions of Britons are drinking water which has been contaminated by pesticides; the Food Minister, David Maclean, describes the British Medical Association report, detailing the concern as outmoded, vague and inaccurate. The Chancellor's parliamentary private secretary has resigned because he wants his say on Europe; MP Tony Favell says he's quit as John Major's right-hand man so he can air his true views from the back benches. Fourteen Mafia bosses have been arrested by Sicilian detectives after a woman's Mafia Godfather lover was gunned down by the organisation. Police say the man was charged with drug trafficking and other, other Mafia activities around Sici, Sicily's west coast. Weather for the Fox F M area: After some early evening sunshine, the night will start dry; cloud and some showery rain is going to spread in from the south er to parts of the region by dawn. The lowest temperatures — just nine degrees celsius, forty eight degrees fahrenheit. It's six thirty three. The British Standards Institution, Kitemark, more often seen on goods like washing machines and fridges, could soon be appearing on solicitor's headed notepaper. The Law Society and the BSI are drawing up plans which would allow firms of solicitors to apply for a kitemark. Peter Taylor from Banbury solicitors, Hancock, says firms who were awarded Kitemark won't be judged on the number of cases they win, but the quality of their work. It does mean that the way in which the case has been handled, the way in which it's been approached, the cooperation between various departments in a particular office, has been done properly, and if the client has the opportunity of winning, he will win and not lose by sloppy work in his solicitor's office. When is this all likely to, to start? It's at a very early stage at the moment, there, there is a code being drafted; it's got to go through various processes and probably won't be in general circulation till December/January. Will you be applying for your er, your own er company of solicitors? I think it's, I think it's quite likely we will, most solicitors who are worth their salt will be contemplating doing so. The problem is going to be the sheer weight of administration of schemes like this, and that's going to make it very difficult for the small firm, because the solicitor sitting at his desk is his own manager, his own salesman and his own factory floor worker. He's got to fulfil all three roles, and the more managerial work going on in the office, the harder it is to find the time to do the work for the clients, which is what produces the fees. The solicitors who, who get the kitemark, where will it go — how will people see it? I think it'll be something which they can show on their headed notepaper. Not outside their front door on their plaque? Probably not, but it, it is, it is at such an early stage that I'm not at all sure what advertising you say to speak, can be made of it. You're listening to the Fox Report. This week is National Chest Week, a first for the Heart, for the er Chest, Heart and Stroke Association. The charity is also funding many research projects, and one of the beneficiaries is the Radcliffe Infirmary where Dr Chris Gerrard is Chest Physician. Dr Gerrard, what sort of things will you be researching? Well we're looking at a particular condition of the lung that affects patients in intensive care; it's a disease a bit like pneumonia, it's called the adult respiratory distress syndrome, and it's a disease that we believe is associated with a lot of fluid in the lung, and a compatriot of mine, Dr Young, and Dr McQuillam have been working on a research that er has asked the question —‘if we reduce the amount of fluid in the lung, do these patients get better and get better quicker’. And they have applied two rather unique techniques to study this question; it's a technique that's er, er rather unique to Oxford, it seems that across the country, most people have looked at this particular problem of reducing the fluid in the lung. And so far, with our results, it looks as if it does not seem to have a major impact on our patients, so we may be doing something that doesn't er particularly help the patients, and this is very important since we spend a lot of time doing these sorts of er procedures in our patients. Now I mentioned that this was Chest Week and it's the first time that the er Chest, Heart and Stroke Association have had a, a, a week specifically aimed at people with chest problems, or, or looking at chest problems. Is it, is it a, a major problem, is it a major medical, medical problem? If you add up all the various er stroke and heart and lung diseases, er you account for possibly fifty or sixty per cent of all the deaths that occur in Great Britain each year. So it's an enormous problem, and certainly worthy of everyone's support. Now Lynne Taylor is Regional Executive for the Chest, Heart and Stroke Association, Lynne er is it, this is er as I said a new week, are, you hopeful that it's, it's working well? Well, we want to obviously make er people aware er both of their chest, I mean we're coming in to the autumn, the winter period when er people who have er a residual chest problem will suffer far more, than say in the warmer, dryer and summer months. Er. But also to make people aware of the Chest, Heart and Stroke Association, what we're trying to do, and that we're there to help people as well as being er an organisation which just hands out money to er doctors. We're there for, to give the help and advice that people need on the day to day living, er because a person with say with a respiratory illness, er would need a lot of benefits er they, their lifestyle has to change, and often their home and adaptation has to change with, around it. Now your a charity aren't you? That's right, yes. How, how do you go about raising your money? Ooh, various methods, er at the moment, we, there's just solely six of us throughout the whole country, that er work on appeals, er we raise money through various means er from flag days in the street to major fund raising efforts, er and events that we organise er round the country. Is there anything coming up locally in the next er er November, mid November, we've got an assault course er based at Bicester barracks, er army barracks in Bicester, and we're inviting er various people over the age of sixteen, who live in and around the Bicester and Oxford areas er as well as down into Aylesbury, er if they'd like to come and take part, and it'd be sponsored for the Chest, Heart and Stroke Association and the work that we do. And that's mid November? That's mid November, yes. And do, do people have to apply to the Association? That's, well no, if they, if they apply either to myself or my colleague, er I am based at St Edmunds Hospital in Northampton and my colleague is based in Birmingham, er they can er, er apply for an entry form and then for the sponsorship forms. Now though Chris, this er is a charity and obviously you've, you've got research money from them; if there wasn't a charity like this, would you be able to do the sort of research that you're doing at the moment? Well, certainly this particular piece of work would have been held up, er the salary that we're able to provide for this young researcher was absol, absolutely essential, and in Great Britain there is an enormous reliance on charitable funding for research, it's absolutely essential. Thank you both very much. Thank you. You're listening to the Fox Report. The reunification of Germany has opened up new opportunities for many in the East, including a group of East German teachers of English who are visiting Oxford this week. It's the first time they've been to Britain, even though some have been teaching English for twenty years; they're staying at the Oxford House School of English, and will also visit the Oxford University Press as the trip has been made possible by an East German publishing house. The teachers believe language teaching will now become easier for them, and say the political changes have given students fresh motivation. Now they know that in listening to information given by television, on television, er on radio, they can buy newspapers produced in Great Britain. Another er important point is that now we can make use of text books that were not available in the past, we got a lot of help from er West German publishing houses, because they provided East German English teachers with er text books, with cassettes and other teaching material, er and that will help to improve the whole teaching situation in that part of Germany. Do you think that education will suffer, what was East Germany. I think there will be many differences in our education system now, we don't know what er system we take from West Germany as you know, we have to overtake nearly everything and we have to lose many things which were quite good in our old system and now we don't have the chance to er to bring it into the connection between East and West Germany, so that is one problem. But generally I think it will become better. In our own system over here, we've had people criticising the shortage of teachers; would any of you consider coming over to Great Britain to teach? That would be a very great challenge for us to do, especially because we have never had the chance before to think about that, but er now I think that could be, er could become reality and I'm quite sure that er there are teachers from that part of Germany who would like to, to work in your country; maybe er English teachers er from East Germany teaching the German language here, that's one thing I could imagine. And for many of them this would be a dream to, come true. You're listening to the Fox Report, I'm Jane Markham. Still to come: Lester Piggott back in the saddle, back on form. Well the longfellow goes for his whip on Nicholas, but he's got the advantage. Nicholas it is in front Amiganamore and racing up towards the line, and it's Nicholas, the maestro is back. Financial report with Halpern and Woolf, keeping Oxfordshire in business. Early U K share gains behind firmer overseas markets were eventually replaced by minor signs of the market worried about recession. Falls on Wall Street had a knock on effect in London and by the close, the Footsie one hundred was down eighteen point three at two O eight three point six. Prices of gold and other precious metals fell on rumours that Saudi investors are selling gold for sterling; on the foreign exchanges the pound was fractionally down on yesterday's close, ending the day at one dollar point nine five seven five, and two deutschmarks point nine six eight five. Today's shares: Abbey National down four to two two three point five, British Aerospace up four to five hundred and thirty nine, British Airways up two at a hundred and thirty nine, British Gas down five to two one eight, British Telecom went down four point five, ending the day at two hundred and seventy point five, the Goodhead Publishing Group went down two to fifty six, Metalbox were up thirty seven to one one two five, Morland Brewers down three at two six five, Oxford Instruments remained at two thirty, while Thames Water stayed at two hundred and twenty eight and T S B were up nought point five at a hundred and thirty eight.

Graham Taylor has announced an unchanged side for tomorrow's European qualifier against Poland at Wembley. Mickey Ianotta our sports editor is here, Mickey, are you happy with who, who he's chosen? Mmi Well I'm happy, but I'm never happy about playing Poland because it always brings back memories to me of the early seventies. Now I can't remember which English player it was, either Bobby Moore or Norman Hunter, I think it was Norman Hunter because he played for Leeds, but they made a mistake and they scored a breakaway goal. But they had this goalkeeper, do you remember him, his name was Thomasescu , he was about ten foot two, eyes of blue, and he stopped everything, Kevin Hector had a go, Alan Clarke, they all did, even Peter Shilton in goal. It just goes to show how well he's done, he was playing in the early seventies, but we should win; what we've got to do tomorrow is not just win well, but we've got to pick up those points, we must win. It's a European qualifier and we do need the points, because Poland away are always difficult. You're going to be on the edge of your seat. I trust they still haven't got their goalkeeper playing? er who, Poland? Yes, the one, the, the ten foot two eyes of blue bloke. Well I don't know, you never know with these Eastern European sides, they've always got something up their sleeve Jane. Okay, what about the Oxford pair Jim Magilton and Paul Kee, are they going to be playing for Northern Ireland? Well I've tried to ring Billy Bingham their manager today, but he can't make up his mind, he, he, apparently he's going to name his side tomorrow. I don't think Paul Kee will play, and to be perfectly honest, I don't think Jim Magilton will play, but we're going to have to wait until tomorrow; Billy Bingham just can't make up his mind. , Well we'll have to wait for that one. Now Witney Town are in action tonight in the first round, first leg of the Southern League Cup against Gloucester; special guest tonight will be the Sheffield Wednesday manager, Ron Atkinson. But of a more serious nature to manager Malcolm Mackintosh, is their latest injury problems. We're losing Dan Taggart with ankle ligament trouble er caused the ache on Saturday, but we, Brian Flannery's back after his flu bout. Now you said it's going to be a tough game, so a message ‘let's get the whole of Witney down there’. Yes, hopefully we'll get a big crowd today, Ron Atkinson's coming to present the, the new strip before the game, so we're hoping for a big crowd. You're listening to the Fox Report. Mickey, amongst the many local games tonight, I suppose you're going to be at Marriott's Close, are you? Yes, I urge everybody in Witney, put down your knives and forks, record your favourites on the video, come on down to Witney, give the lads a cheer, they are playing Gloucester City. Ron Atkinson's not the only attraction there, and they're a tough team, top of the Premier Division. But other games tonight: At Buckingham Road, Aylesbury United, third from top in the Vauxhall Premier, they're playing the side who were top — Kingstonian, so they're going to expect a crowd of nearly two thousand. And do you know what they do at Buckingham Jane, their nicknamed the ducks, and all their supporters have these warblers that go quack quack, so hopefully we'll hear a few of those tonight. I might hear them at Witney. In the Southern League Cup, first round, first leg, Buckingham Town, The Robins, they're at home to Bury St Edmunds,and we've always got one of these, now I know how Phil Angel feels on Saturday. Wellingborough against Brackley in the Hillier Cup, that's being played at the Dog and Duck ground, I would imagine it's blow football in a pub, and finally, in the Overton Papers combination, pretty boring this one — Watford Reserves against Oxford Reserves. Hmm, well, okay, last night Mickey, you and I just about wrote off Lester Piggott's career, and er today, well inside the last furlong of er one of his three races I believe today, this is how Rapid Raceline's course commentator John Penny, saw the closing stages. in the distance and it's Nicholas being pressed by Amigamanore , these two matching stride and the long fellow goes for his whip on Nicholas, but he's got the advantage. Nicholas it is in front, in front of Amigamanore and racing up towards the line, and it's Nicholas, the maestro is back, he's come back with that Nicholas. Lester Piggott from Amigamanore,. Well there you go Mickey, did you have any money on this one — I bet you didn't after what you said last night? Well no, no, I didn't fancy him yesterday, he was a bit rusty, he needed a day to get back into form, but two winners; lets mention the other one, that one in the Biddistone all age stakes, Nicholas was there, six to four on, trained by his good lady and half and hour later, in the four o'clock,finish, Shining Jewel, romped home at eleven to one in the Gainsborough Claiming Stakes, a division two race for three year olds. You know, I thought he was about fifty odd, but what I must mention Jane, mustn't forget in his first race in the three o'clock, he came last on Ruddy Cheek. You're listening to the Fox Report. An emotional reunion after more than fifty years has taken place today, between two Britons who were evacuated as children to the United States and their American foster mother. Along with hundreds of other children, Dinah and Clifford Matthews from Totten in Hampshire, were shipped across the Atlantic to safety. Their story forms the basis of a new exhibition at the Imperial War Museum. Mark Phillips was there. It was an emotional moment back in nineteen forty as Cliff, Dinah and their sister Sheila waved goodbye to their family and friends and set sail for America. Cliff, who was just twelve at the time, remembers it was an exciting journey. Well it was during the height of the er blitz; we went in convoy from Liverpool, way north up amongst the icebergs which was exciting, and er then we came down to St Lawrence to Montreal, and then went down to er New York, and then eventually to er, we were dispersed around the countryside, and, and er we were fortunate enough to be sent to Cincinnati. The children met up with their new foster parents, Bill and Janet Matthews. My husband went to er a meeting of the English Speaking Union, whatever that is, and they said there was going to be need for homes for English children. And so he said ‘well, we have three sons, all of whom were going to war, and er so we would have room for three children. Of course, in England we were used to er especially at the beginning of the war, we had tea in the afternoon of course , and er when we got there it was dinner at night, with you know, meat and vegetables every night, that sort of thing, so it was quite a surprise. And, and er my tummy took a while to get used to it . I went from a er boy's school and all that that implied at the time in England, strict discipline, uniforms, that sort of thing, to er High School, a mixed High School in Ohio where the atmosphere was totally different, much more relaxed, much more friendly. The concentration frankly wasn't so much on education I think, er as it was in, in er bringing people up. Both Cliff and Dinah loved life in America so much, that although they were shipped home after the war, they both decided to move back, and they now live there with their families. The exhibition which opens today at the Imperial War Museum features their letters and memories of the time, along with those of their fellow Atlantic evacuees. On the M twenty five between junctions fifteen and sixteen there's some heavy clockwise traffic, that's just between the M four and the M forty. The M forty itself between junctions four and five, that's between High Wycombe and Stokenchurch, there are two narrow lanes in both directions and a contraflow running for a short stretch about midway between the two junctions, there's also down to single line traffic at times. You might er be subject to delays on the A thirty four between Botley and Hinksey Hill where there are some roadworks on the southbound carriageway. And Banbury Town centre, there's the Michaelmas Street Fair going on until Saturday, so there are some road closures and various diversions for traffic. Martin Lawford, A A roadwatch. And it's not been too bad in the rush hour on the er local public transport; I've no problems to report to you on either the buses or the trains. Cambridge University Press have just published the Cambridge Encyclopaedia; a one volume tome with over thirty thousand cross referenced entries. Paul James, who's the publisher's marketing manager, er for their reference section, is travelling the length and breadth of the country to promote the encyclopaedia. I asked him if he didn't feel a trifle audacious in coming to Oxford, home of Oxford University Press. Well I'm not daunted I think, challenged I think is probably the word, but I think there is room in the market, I mean they have their Oxford English Dictionary say, which is one of their flagships you might say. We have now the Cambridge Encyclopaedia which is probably as important to us as the dictionary is to them, it's a really important new publication for us, and a book which there isn't really an equivalent from Oxford, so I think there's room for both of us. So this, this is the very first Encyclopaedia? From Cambridge it is, yes, er that's actually one of its great strengths, because it isn't a thing which has been revised and added on to, it is completely new, and before we actually made it, our editor, David Crystal, er actually is probably the only person in the world to have sat and read through from cover to cover four other encyclopaedias, to find out what was wrong with them, how they could be improved. And having done that daunting task, he then attempted the even more daunting task of putting all this information together into this enormous book, and it is, as you see before you, a very hefty tome. It's, it's a hefty tome, but, some encyclopaedias run to about you know, fifteen volumes, so it must have been quite an editorial job actually. It is, er it being a modern book as I say, completely new, it's, it's, it's part of the desk top publishing sort of revolution, so the actual data base is, is all held on computer, on a magnetic tape and is actually much bigger than this single volume book. But this is probably as big a book as you can get in one volume, which we wanted, we wanted a single volume handy desk top encyclopaedia. So this is as big as we could get without it falling apart, so it's a nice handleable book, though a little heavy. Being on a data base, I suppose it means it'll make it slightly easier to update when you come to update it? That's, that's right, it's being updated now even as we speak. I mean the book itself is just published last, er Thursday I believe it was, and er so it was up to date, is up to date until the summer, which is you know more up to date than any other book, so it's got things like: Greta Garbo dying, and Princess Eugenie being born and Nelson Mandela being free, and of course it's the first encyclopaedia to have all the details of nineteen eighty nine, the, the upheaval in, in Europe, all the political changes and whatever. But of course the minute you put a, slap a cover on this information, it begins to, to change and people die and new governments are elected and whatever, er so yes, we are, we have in our employ someone who's sole job it is to read all the newspapers, er watch the T V, all the media and keep all the information up to date, so the, that's a full time job really and they're working on the data base day and night You're listening to the Fox Report. John Voight, the American film star, perhaps best known for his Oscar winning performance in Midnight Cowboy, is in Oxford for a couple of days. Tomorrow he's giving his first ever lecture at the University Examination School, which is actually open to anyone, not just students. He's here at the invitation of Jewish groups, the Habad House and the Oxford University, the Heim Society. Tonight at nine, he'll be at the British premiere of his latest film at the Phoenix Theatre in Oxford. It's his first film for five years and he told me it's been creating quite a stir, because of its subject matter. Reincarnation, deja vu, astral travel, the God force, is it all true? Eternity — something like that, you know?, in some way, it's a tale that in, the, that embraces those er thoughts that so many people are thinking these days, and yet I'm an old fashioned fellow, erm and I say that by saying er yes, this, this is some, somewhat of a er new age category, all these things. Er. And yet really, it harkens back to er very ancient thought, er half the world of course is teaching reincarnation, and even the Christian and Jewish world er have in their history the teaching of reincarnation, so it's not something brand new. But erm for us, we just felt well maybe, maybe there is something to that, maybe there is a possibility, erm in that area, in, in talk, talking about eternity. Do, do the themes in your film echo the sort of themes you'll be talking about at the er the lecture on Wednesday. Well, I'm sure that there will be some folks at the lecture that will raise those questions, I, I have so much to say and I've been making notes. I have a, a little formal statement which I've composed which says a very strong thing, and then I have you know, just a, a, quite a lot of little pieces of information that I'm composing so that people will get a, a view of me in my little journey. And er the subject matter of the, the lecture is ‘Searching the heart of humanity, to find the common bond’, which is of course, it's, it's just like my film ‘Eternity’, it's a huge , you know, it creates a huge expectation, but I'm not afraid to step in front of people now and, and er you know, present myself and say ‘well let's ask the big question, let's, let's go for it, so er so it should be quite a lot of fun tomorrow. Although these subjects are quite imposing, I think that er that both events are going to be a lot of fun, that the movie's a love story basically and er it also has a lot of humour in it and fun, and the lecture er it's not, not only quite serious in, in a sense that, with the topic, but it's also quite audacious, and I think that, that er there's an element of fun to that too. In other words, I'll tell a few anecdotes about my life, I'll expose myself to these students and the people who are interested, and well you know, what's going on with me and we, we'll have some fun, so it'll be anything but dry. And Jon Voight's film ‘Eternity’ is premiered at the Phoenix Theatre at nine o'clock tonight; his lecture is tomorrow at five o'clock at the University Examination School, and all are welcome. And that was the Fox Report for Tuesday the sixteenth of October 1990. cos it makes a fun funny humming or buzzing noise because it picks up the vibrations through the table otherwise. Now then Pen and pencil would would be a useful idea. Now what did we do before? Erm we've done time signatures, compound time signatures. Erm Yeah didn't we? tonics all that sort of stuff, diminished, augmented We did some intervals intervals. Yes. Right. Now can you tell me about time signatures? What, what are the two types of time signatures? Compound Mhm. and erm what's the other one? Simple. Simple. Yeah. Just ordinary simple and compound. And there's Simple and compound. Yeah. Compound's things like six nine, six nine erm Nine twelve Yeah. That sort of stuff. At the top. That's the top number. Erm. And compound is three four. Tha that's comp that's compound. Now compound is always six. Oh. Simple is just ordinary three beats a bar, Yeah. four beats in a bar, two beats in a bar. It's the compou think of compound as being the one that's more difficult to think about. Six eight times, nine eight times. Yeah. Right. Still leaves three two three or four beats in a bar, but they're compound times. They're dotted beats. That's really all that compound means. It means dotted beats. Erm what would twelve twelve four? Think about twelve four cos that's a compound time. It's got twelve at the top. Erm it may help to look at it. Cos you can't think about it straight away. Think twelve, and it'll be twelve what? Dotted semi-quavers. No. What does four stand for in an ordinary time signature? Oh crotchets. Right so So. if there are twelve of those. Twelve crotchets. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve. Think of them in groups of threes and that gives you four dotted? Quavers. No. Semi-quavers. You're, you're going small Yes. and you've got to go the other way. Oh yeah. It's erm If there are tw if there are twelve crotchets and each of those are in groups of three. Dotted minims. So you've got four dotted minims. So twelve, I mean if you can remember them twelve stands for four beats in a bar anyway Yeah. and if you just think what twelve crotchets are going to be divided up into Mm. it's going to dotted minims. Cos you know it's going to be dotted something or other. And if you were to see er an extract of music for example here's a twelve eight one. This one actually tells you it's in twelve eight time. And it's asking you to put in the bar lines. Where would you put those bar lines do you think? It would al I think it probably also asks you to to group them properly. But just for the moment we won't worry about the grouping aspect. I think, assume everything starts on the first beat of the bar as well. Okay. It'll tell you if it doesn't. Erm Eight stands for ? Quavers. Right One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve . So obviously the first one would be there. And probably if it's going to be a whole one One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve. So in fact there are just two bars. Now how would you actually group those notes? Erm it'd be groups of three again wouldn't it? In groups of three. Those two've got to be grouped together. One two three four Er it'd be sort of half of that. Half of the erm crotchet. I don't know how you do that. Can we go backwards. One two three four five You can only do it if you miss out that. One two three. One two three. And that leaves you with a a little bit Right. Yes. It actually explains it. Exactly what they want you to do. Er where you've got a note that obviously goes over a beat as in that one there Yeah. you're, you're going to have to write two quavers and tie them. Is that what you said? Yeah. It might have been what you said . So those two okay. That one will be joined to a quaver beat, so that you'll have a group of three. And another quaver, those two will be tied the join taking them onto the next group of three and so on. So basically you're splitting this in compound time? Yes. So it it'd still sound Cos that, that actually looks as though it's the half way part of the bar too doesn't it? So, and you, you don't actually go over the half Yeah. way part of the bar with one single note. If you've got a note it's got to be held. You actually split into two an and use a tie. If you're in two time or four time which you are. You're in four four dotted crotchets beats there aren't they? You will sometimes be asked to er look at something like that and then put the time signature in. These have got the time signature in but you're, they're asking you to put in the bar lines and then grouping the notes properly. As in that one, you've go you've got to alter what they actually put there. Not going to alter the sound of it. The sound must still be the same but you've got to alter the notes for grouping purposes. That may happen in any of those. I wonder if they've got any here now that haven't got any time signatures, because that's the other thing that they they like to give you. Down here. Add time signatures. Alright. Let's see what you can make of first of all that one. And whether they're all compound, they may not all be compound. Some may be, some may not. I don't know. Find the simplest bar in each one. this one. Looking through it that is the simplest one cos you can see Yes. at a glance there are two It's all, it's all groups of three aren't there? Yeah. So that's obviously going to be in compound time. What though? Erm Fairly easy to put in a time signature. Six twelve. Six er now wait a minute. What's four is for crotchets. Eight is for quavers. Double it again, sixteen. Six sixteen. It's gonna be sixteen. So six sixteen. And that actually means two dotted crotch two dotted quavers I mean, doesn't it? Cos each group adds up to a dotted quaver. Mm. So it Yeah. As you've got here. That's right. In fact, if anything, which is the easiest way round of doing it? To be, if you're asked to put in a time signature? It's not always so easy to to group notes. I think people find that more difficult than actually saying what a time signature is. Mhm. What about that one? Erm Take the simplest bar. Three quavers. So the time signature is? Erm three eight. Three eight. Now And it's grouped in a dotted crotchet. Yes it is. Now is that compound or is that simple? Three eight is simple. It's simple because it's just got three at the top. Mm. It looks as if it ought to be with the compound ones but it's not. It's just an ordinary simple one. But it's quaver beats instead of crotchet beats, that's all. So that was a simple one, that one was a compound one. We'll do one more. What about this one? Is there an easy ? No they're, they're all, virtually all exactly the same Erm timing aren't they? They're not quite the same. two three four five six Yeah. six erm six four. Yes. Six four which is dotted? Minims. Two dotted minims. Yes, yes. Two dotted minims in a bar. That's one of them. And that, in fact that's probably the simplest bar isn't it? Because Mm. that's a group of three. Much the same as a dotted, dotted minim. Erm simple or compound time then? It's Six six four four that's simple. No, compound. Compound. Two, three, four or five would be simple times. Six, twelve They sound more complicated Mm. so think of them as being compound. Right. That way round then isn't so difficult. That I think you I think most people find it more difficult having to group the notes in the right, in exactly the right way. So I think. This is actually a grade four one. We'll lead up gradually to grade five . Yeah. I'm not going to go all the way back through grades two and three. You started on two I think. Or you've got Book Two. We'll go, we'll go from I think . here. And anything that you find you don't know then we can perhaps go back on just the bits that you don't know. Because you're not going to have to go back on many of the things. This book, these books are quite good because they do give you a little bit of explanation. You've also got er other books or another book at home which you can refer to if you need any extra. Erm it might be an idea to go back. You won't find you're going to take much time doing some of these. If you do exercise one for the time being don't worry about that one, exercise three. Shall I write it down? Yes, it would be a good idea, wouldn't it? Mm. Do you want to write on the back of It would be because you've already got some in here haven't you? I think I probably Yeah. Actually I'll carr I'll carry on on And the date today is the The twenty eighth I think. Ah the twenty eighth. It's the next thing on isn't it ? So if you're looking in the grade four book put down page four, exercise one. If you have a look at each one of those. Rather than write them in the book, just put the answers down either on a on a piece of paper. As long as you put clearly what it is you're putting in. Then I can just use these books over and over again. It's a bit pointless writing in them. When it comes to exercise three that's on page five, exercise three. When it says add bar lines it won it won't hurt you to actually write those out. Because Okay. you really need to group the notes. Well the notes are grouped but you're gonna add the . Write it out because it's all good practice for for you actually. At er writing out notes as well. So you can do exercise three. Not that one for now because that's doing something different. Now which are the ones that you've got to to group? So far over here. Right. Page page eight starts exercise six. In fact do all of those. Do A through to F. And that's grouping notes plus the bar lines. The later ones are always quite hard. And they've given you they've actually given you, not in this one, but they do give you the clefs here. They've given you the clefs. Did we look at those before? Alto clefs and tenor clefs? Er don't think so. Have you come across those before? come across these. You've come across the treble and the bass right? and the bass, not these alto or whatever. Erm if just take just think of singers at the moment. Soprano is the highest, then an alto Soprano, then an alto , tenor, bass tenor and bass. Soprano is the highest voice. Then comes the alto. Then the tenor and then the bass at the . Oh right. So is So that's that's alto. So is that one up from It's one down from the treble. Think of it as being the next lot down if you like. Then there would be a tenor clef and then a bass clef. The only reason that, that you're using a different clef is that it's actually putting middle C in a different place. On the stave. So that for example an alto doesn't need so many notes, high notes, but needs a few more lower notes. So if you just kept your treble clef you'd have a lot of lines possibly that you weren't using at all. And having to add a lot of low ledger line notes. That saves doing that. Because they position middle C. Middle C's actually positioned between those bits there so the middle line there becomes middle C. Which means that you're unlikely to have to have quite so many ledger line notes. Although this has got one or two. But not as many as you would have if you were using the treble clef because you'd probably end up with a lot of lower this is wha , that isn't a particularly good example really because it hasn't given a lot of lower notes but normally you'd expect to see more notes down on these lines. Soprano wouldn't go down that far. A soprano would only go down to about erm oh about what? Middle C is probably a bit too low for, for most sopranos. But an alto would go a lot lower, would go down probably to an F or a G. So that these notes would be low. If that's middle C you can te what would the bottom line actually be? Bottom line? That's C Er it would It's here. er G. C A F, you're right, yes. Erm so that in fact a true alto would be using most of the notes there. And just a few ledger lines above. Unlikely to be using whereas if they were using the treble clef for most of the time F G. Yes. And then the other one, the tenor clef. Have they given you a tenor clef? No. They'll give you a tenor clef a little bit further on. They may not actually put the tenor clef in till grade grade five now I come to think about that. But there's no point in Not learning it about it now because it's just as easy really. Tenor clef looks exactly the same but middle C is now there. Next line up in fact. So because a tenor sings a little bit lower you've got more of the lower notes and fewer of the higher notes before you need to add start adding ledger line notes. Sometimes of course you'll, they'll still need ledger line notes up there. And perhaps one down there but not very likely. So it's just to make it much more comfortable to look at. Just means you have to get used to thinking, right if that's if, if that's er er a tenor clef then that note won't be it would be, be an A in a bass clef and F in a treble clef. What will it be for that clef? In this erm oh Going downwards going backwards is, is more difficult isn't it? Yeah. Much easier working upwards from C. That line's C. So that line C. would be? C A F D Er C A E You go one below it. Oh yeah. You know F is next in fact C yes. That's A, that's F, that would be D so it's between the two which, which is an E. And if you were going above of course, that note would be? E. E and remember that it's the E just above middle C. And that's the E Does the middle C always come up on a line? Well it's yes it does in fact. Mm. I hadn't actually thought of that before. But yes it does seem to. I suppose theoret theoretically you could actually move middle C to wherever you wanted to have it. But generally speaking they us they use just the four clefs. Now certain instruments use the alto clef. Just a minute. Hello. Oh hello. Alright. Right I'll fetch him, I'll fetch him. Yes he's here. Oh somewhere he is. He's jus just upstai he's just upstairs so I shan't be a moment I'll go and call him . Gosh she's going to have fun with this tape. Go on out you go. Right Yes. So middle C then can be almost anywhere. Yeah. What instrument do you know about do you think that uses something other than the treble clef and a bass clef? Or have you come across the one that Erm instrument that I know. Well that, that you might know. It's not actually a percussion one but it's er in fact I don't, I think most of the percussion ones tend to use a a bass clef don't they? Yeah, yeah. If you see one at all. Yeah or erm xylophones and glocks and those. Except they use treble and bass They use the treble don't they? Yes. Er Bass or whatever. Yeah. Xylophone. Yes, it's a treble. And a vibraphone? Just I've got one of those nice little Yes. It's just like a, a small sort of piano. Doesn't have a very long key keyboard. It doesn't I don't think. Quite an It's a piano and it's odd range. It's very high. Because in fact although it's written from there all the way up to there, erm that is it starts at the C above middle C and goes up Yeah. to very high the unfortunate thing snare drum. I think that's played on the bass what would be on the piano an A. Yes. It, it, they use cert certain lines don't they? They use yeah erm So that you, you get to know what is I think it's er what is what. A is the bass drum. Yeah. er I think it's G they use as the high-hat and there's all sorts of things. Yeah. I don't thing they one thing they don't give in this book is a complete score Yeah. which oh do they? No they don't. No. Which of course I'll ask yeah I've got plenty of those sort Mm. of things anyway. You have to know an awful lot you know for grade five. You, you've gotta have quite a wide knowledge. You, you don't have to, need to know anything in, in depth but you've got to know But you've got to know shallow a wider range. Yes that's right which means in a way that you've got to know quite a lot. There's erm an alto, no, yes an alto clef, isn't it? For trombone, no, it's not, it's for, yes it's for one of the trombones, isn't it? Tuba. Oh I erm found out what that brass instrument we couldn't think of. What was it? Euphonium. Euphon yes. You're erm isn't it silly Mm. I've, I've because you see I could see wh exactly what you were talking about in my mind Mm. but I could not think of its name. Yeah. I got into the car and I was still erm thinking all about this It's, it's, yeah. and my mother said straight away, oh you're thinking of a euphonium. Yeah. That's the one. Yes. It's so silly isn't it when er you know that you knew it all the time. Now then. The one I'm looking for is what, have I got to the strings yet? No I haven't got back to the strings. These just use the bass or the treble clef. And when you get back to the There we are. The strings. It's the viola that we're actually looking for. Sort of bass violin. Sort of bass violin, yes . There we are. That's the one that uses it. So that you see even in a score it would be written like that. So that's the only, only instrument that you generally see, actually see using it in most, most schools. Unless you're going into some of the tenor erm and alto Can I sign those for accuracy, please? I'm taking the silence to be assent. Matters arising on those minutes on page one. On minute one one four, I'm using my privilege as a chair to hang on to that; the fact that the Poly are to hold a conference on health and housing in the new year. I've asked that members be invited to that, I'm sure some of you'd be interested to do that. You may recall that this committee has asked for a health and housing conference but we seem to get under it rather a lot of times, nothing it appears to be happening. Can I have your agreement that we write to the director of housing and ask for his position on it? Will you agree that we do that, rather than have the same thing coming up time after time. Anything else on page one? Also on that, chair, just to clarify the situation, because I know it's a bit vague, we are erm asking the health authority to run the erm meeting with other local authority counties, do you remember? The referral agency's to be in B? Right, lovely. We're doing that. Great, thank you very much indeed for that. On page 2, matters arising. Sheila? One one six, chair. I would like to congratulate the officers for that day. It was a very educational day, but extremely harrowing afternoon, which is still living with me. And I would like to say at this point I was very disappointed that the County Council was lead role was modestly but quite accurately described in that, fairly lengthy er, interview. And I've also found out that he's not interested in fishing or bridge, the man's one intre two interests, work and er, rejuvenating his house, and his, and he doesn't cook even. Now, isn't shameful? Anyway, , can I, can I just say, thank you Chairman, but could I just say on two three, I think that one of things that built the partnership was actually the launch of Ludlow, and that all those organizations were there, and helped part of the process, and I think one of the things we need to think about, Chairman, is now we've got that B status, even though we're arguing at the fringes, we've actually got it, is perhaps doing another event like Ludlow, to involve all the organizations that, that, that will be participating in the programme, to give them a, so that they feel a, a common ownership of the programme, they can put forward the projects they want, they feel they are part of the process. I think it's those kind of things which holds the partnerships together, and keep everybody good. Right, well following that then, is it agreed that also we write to both the Secretary of State and our local M Ps, Yes putting our points of view, and we agree to say that they are with complete all-party support. And, and Chairman, that we've had support, we've had a great deal of help from party in Europe and it's kept us informed Yes, indeed, indeed, yes. Now objective two status in Telford, a happy story, but it's not as happy. Well not as happy Chairman, because There's still quite as I said yesterday, if I was a betting man, I wouldn't have bet on getting anything actually, erm, and the partnership between the County Council and, and the District Council have put together the bid for objective two status in Telford. The original bid was for the retention of the er, objective status in the Telford and regional travel to work area, which is the whole of the region and Bridgenorth area. Erm, it became very clear that that, that bid erm, was in fact, at an early stage, that that bid was not, did not have a realistic chance of being successful, so as, as you know Chairman, when you went on the delegation to see er, Mr in London, actually at that meeting, er, the members of the delegation said to the Secretary of State, well, we recognize, Secretary of State that it's the wrong area, what we'd like to really argue for is a bid for the urban core out in Browsley, erm, in, at the end of the day, we didn't even quite get that, but what we did manage to get was objective two status for the urban core of Telford still, and I think that was probably against the odds. Whereas I always felt that we would get five B, I didn't feel confident we would manage to retain any objective two, and, and the partnership in that area have managed to retain it. On that, I think it is generally known, that we, that Telford wasn't anywhere near the top of the list, and it had been taken purely on the question of the er, needs of the various areas, it's unlikely that Telford would have succeeded, even with its reduced geographical area, but I made discrete enquiries and was told that the factor which tipped er, the Commission in favour of Telford, and this has an important bearing on what we're going to discuss later, was the fact that Telford has been very good in taking up schemes and providing their section, and not just the Wreakin District Council, other area, other bodies in Telford, of getting good innovative schemes off the ground and providing the cash, they didn't, as some areas did, get the status, and then hardly do anything about it. Now, I think that's significant for us when we start looking at our own response to what we're doing, both in objective two and in, more importantly in five B. You will, you note the recommendation and again thank you for general support on that issue. Item fourteen, rural economic development initiative. Are you ready. Yes, Chair, it's er, remember at the, the last meeting we touched on the first part of the report, the worry about the issue of closing shops, and rural post offices and garages, and there's considerable interest from all members er, as to what could be done. What we've come forward now is, through is a series of proposals, now these would apply to all, all of these, there was some concern at the meeting that we didn't of them, which appeared to have no, no chance at all as I told you, so all of these issues would actually apply to all of them, but the kind of things that are talked about, is trying to get a, a standard of systems throughout Shropshire so we need the importance of the way they, they sell a fruit shop within, within a, a rural are a rural village. Erm, where the, the authority, not just the County Council, but the authority in the partnership, get involved in lobbying exercises with the, with the government to try to ensure that rural post offices can actually give out vehicle licences, because it's very, if you look in the north of the county, outside the towns there's only four post offices, I think, that can actually give out vehicle licences, and yet in the rural areas, we have a lot of people with vehicles, and we, and the way that it counts towards, the way that it counts up towards a post office's survival, it's these high value items are significant in keeping post offices open. That we should work with the R D C in helping to develop management skills in, in the village shops, that we shouldn't see whether we can't use the village shops as tourist information points in the area. You know, there are a string of the things of this kind of nature to try to make village shops er, more viable to try and ensure their survival. Erm, there's just one item which m might be added, or perhaps our representatives on this body could take it up some time, and that's the amount of deposit which is needed by the post office from er, new tenants, I don't know if they're called tenants, or licensees whatever, to run rural post offices. I believe that if the post office changes hands, that's quite a crucial time because the newcomers may have to put up front quite a large sum of money. I know this was the case in an Oswestry post office, although it was a, on, on a suburban estate where there had actually been er security problems, or pilfering problems there. But perhaps you could look into that. Well thank you, er,yes. Erm, may I just add also, that, that it's, it's my feelings that the security aspects of rural post offices, the face that we're giving out advice into given problems, er, I know in my particular area, we had a, a post office erm, kitted out, erm, there were tremendous costs involved in the security aspects in that particular post office or sub-post office. And I think you'll probably find that that is going to be a problem in rural areas. Not that I don't wish it to carry on. You know, to be aware of the situation, It's something the loans scheme could actually look at, I should think. Look at the whole thing and if they want to take out we should offer to help them Finance the security Yes, yes, sort of a one-off payment, an ongoing, erm, response. Any other comments? We do need to appoint our representative, or aren't, we haven't reached the Whitchurch initiative yet? Alright, sorry Right, Whitchurch seven, the, the report they want, where we're getting to and there is an appendix at the proposals of course, for developing erm, a forum for Whitchurch er, with a range of activities that we could undertake to try to regenerate some confidence in Whitchurch. I see us moving more and more, towards what I call these kind of targets of activities, we've got the Victoria Ward in Ludlow, we've to the er, the Whitchurch initiative, there's something going on in, in Lud in Ludlow at present which is particularly education, social service linked at , but at the end of the day that's also about jobs, two jobs of training, and perhaps one of the ways in which we solve er, land issues erm, and, and of course Craven Arms is now, is now coming up in each profile as needing something done, and I'm also being approached about the East Water Block Coking where there are particular problems in those areas. The Whitchurch one is probably the second most advanced one now after the Victoria, Oswestry ward, but the Oswestry, sorry the Victoria ward instead of Oswestry, and there is a, a, a need, I think Chairman, that I think will be very close now to, to forming a, a, a joint consortium to look at, which goes between the County, er, the District, the Town Council, the Tech, the Rural Development Commission, local businesses in Whitchurch, the local Chamber of Commerce in Whitchurch, to try to pull everybody together, to pool their efforts and resources for the town. And, and, and there is the need to appoint, er, three representatives, Chairman, to serve upon this Committee, on this Whitchurch forum. With regard to the three representatives, can I propose from the Chair that we split them very conveniently, one Liberal, one Labour, and one Conservative. Is that agreed as a fair way of proceeding? Right, fine, nominations? Well, then I propose Jack for our group, Certainly I've got a convoluted proposal,people Well, I, I, if I can anticipate, it's quite possible for Arthur to be in another two groups, to er, notify us who their representative is in due course in writing The same applies to our Conservative members, let us know in due course. Okay. Livestock studies, whatever that is. Yes, just for information, Chairman Yes erm, really the other items are, the other items on the report are for information apart the child care links. Yes we need a, we're spending money again. If we're spending much money, Bruce, it'll be as big as this er, code before we get any. Well, I think we may actually be able to get some of it actually with support towards it, if we play it right, because other things are particularly important that we support organizations which are trying to solve the problem of women returning to work when they have children, and to cre so that they can create the mechanisms that the children can be looked after, after school and during the school holidays. And in, in a sense, it's trying to use an economic, it's, it's because they're, they're setting up child care organizations, people employing child care, it's, it's creating an economic development solution to the social problem. A hopeless Mr Chairman, it's just, just the sort of reason why we didn't su didn't support spending eight thousand pounds on, on some low pay unit, this is just the sort of thing that we feel that, that Committee's money should be spent on. Well we welcome the latter part of your comment, I was going to make a wisecrack about this is our idea of getting back to basics, family values, but I don't want,I'm going to stay out of it . Malcolm, you indicate Do you, do you happen to know, will this service give benefit advice as well, because the, the budget which introduced a, an allowance of a kind for, for child care, is actually quite complicated, and, and it's kind of er, an amount of income which can be disallowed before Family Credits are calculated and it, it, it involves a new kind of benefits trap as well , and I can see people needing quite a lot of advice about how to get it, and, and when not to get it and so on . I wasn't aware of that problem Yes Can something, but if they don't do something which is suggested yes, yes, Well, there is general agreement on the free counselling for families, thank you. Any other points? Chairman, could I just mention to the Committee, on Shropshire child care links, erm, the County Council of course, is also the registration body that erm, registers childminders and day care, and erm, while obviously this is very much to be supported and ties in with Social Services' own requirements to promote child care, it should not be seen, and we should perhaps, Bruce make a, we can have discussions with, we should be careful to endorse, the giving of this money doesn't necessarily imply or endorse the standards of the people on their books, who may be people that the County Council in another arm, are investigating and in some cases, taking action to close down. So, we just need to be clear that er, we're not actually endorsing the list necessarily. Right, Paper M which follows. There, there is no Paper M. That's the economic development strategy. Sorry Erm, the problem is that this should, this agenda was prepared over the Christmas period basically, and, and we started on the preparations of an economic development strategy in, in accordance with the way we'd done it before, which was basically a strategy of what we were going to do ourselves. And it did seem to me that in the light of, erm, of the single regeneration budget, on the light of the need to be developing a regeneration strategy for Shropshire, perhaps the role of the County Council in this affair should actually be, er, as, as the local government for the county, should be to look at preparing a, a regeneration strategy for the whole county, at which the work that we do to economic development is one of the pillars of support as is the work that the districts do is another pillar of support, as is the work of the R D C and the objective five programme, and all the various other bodies that are involved in, in economic development and similar activities in . So really starting towards looking at the different nature of strategies the new one would have. It would enclose within it, a traditional economic development strategy for the work this Committee's helping, but it should look in a wider issue, and seek to influence wider, wider things that happen within the county. And it should have a view on, on issues like education and transport, and those kind of things because they're all critical to the long-term future of economic viability within Shropshire. What I was going to suggest then, Chairman, in the light of, in a sense a change of, a change of thought by me over the Christmas period, in a way it's probably best it happened, is to ask if we could, because I'm, I'm keen that, this kind of different kind of strategy, there is a, there is a member ownership of the strategy, rather than just put something to you, that you would then have to, you know you, you have the paper in front of you, it's a thirty page document, and you decided is actually to suggest that you have actually a, a, a member group of, of, of a few members, perhaps three or four members, erm, to actually work with me on this, in the development of that strategy, so there was actually a member involvement, because it's straying more into the political field. There is a member involvement in the process of developing that overall strategy, in, into the kind of Shropshire that we would wish to see in the future. Any comment? Well, I, I think it's a sound idea, I think it's sad at a time of local government reorganization when we're likely to see authorities getting smaller, and yet the, the issues won't get any smaller, and the new authorities may well be having to look at ways of getting together with their neighbours to look at strategies which cover areas of the sort of size of the old county areas, and also getting together to, to, to meet, erm, organizations which will still on county-size boundaries, like Techs, and, and similar. So, yes, I would certainly support that we look into this proposition. Doesn't that make a mockery of smaller unitary authorities? Well, yes Of course it does, we look at the guidance notes, and they say things like the police and the health authorities want erm, larger units the size of the present County Council, I'm sorry to go on. No, no, you don't have to apologise to me. You know I can't help it. It, it highlights the need for us to take a rational approach does it not, to er, the local government review, and realize that cooperation is essential between all parties concerned for the best interests of Shropshire as, as a whole, the people of Shropshire as a whole. It's very important. I'm, I'm, I'm resisting temptation to get involved in this debate. Let's stick to this concept, I, I welcome it, I think it shows good thinking on the part of our officers and I would like to suggest that er, I take er, a back seat on this one, and I, I, I'd feel probably, set up a sub-committee, I would think four or five is ample, and I would like to propose that Malcolm chairs this meeting, so that we have a fresh brain and a younger brain, looking at the future's problems. How do you feel about it? I still think the P A G is probably about the right size body isn't it? How many in that? Seven, I think Seven, a bit big I would, I wouldn't go bigger than five, you get through a lot more business with four or five. Still, I don't, I don't mind. You do want it cross-party? Absolutely, absolutely. I'll second it Two, two, two, two, one, yes Two, two, one and, and the groups tell us who the representatives are, and I, I won't serve on the committee, I think I'll er, that I'll, you've given me enough to do anyway, there's a limit, and unlike our officer, I do have to do some cooking. You'll never live that down, then Frank Yes, I thought that was a bit of flab that we've got Do you get a better breakfast at school? Right, on the other comments on this strategy, Could I just say to Chairman, Yes I, I, I could do with knowing those, those, the names fairly quickly on that one, because, mhm, get started on Yes, and get some dates, yes, yes that exercise to produce something by the end of January,consultation. Right. Erm, Training for Work, Paper O, it's for information isn't it? Right Chairman, yes, the report's for information, there are a few things to update, occupancy remains healthy, erm,the working total has fallen slightly over the Christmas recess, but erm, really by ten there. I have put into the report that we did erm, sign contract variations on, on Friday last week, which will have regularized all the training we're doing, so we're now in the comfortable position where erm, people wanting to add a further right hand column to that table there, erm, we've now got contracts which cover a band of two percent of the training . In other words, we get paid for it,and er, that's very satisfactory. Erm, over the page, the section, and the session, training needs position, erm, the erm, the work of the consultants has been completed, and we've still not got a report from Tech or any indication of, of erm, what their reaction would be to the, to the report which comes out. Erm, so it's still a issue on this. Erm, leisure services product, erm, project erm, closure, really that was an opportunity to erm, to close the loss making element of provision without cost, and in view of the erm, rather poor outlook for maintenance work for the next contract year, it seemed sensible for us to do that. Erm, likewise there's still been no formal response on training travel budgets from the Tech. Erm, I'm not in a position to add anything very much to the article for next year, I spent most of Friday afternoon with the Tech last week, erm, but there's still obviously a good deal of uncertainty about programmes for next year, erm, what I think has been very positive is that we have now er, this year for the first time since the Tech's formation, they've started to discuss some of the issues about the programmes with a group of providers. Good We hope that that will lead to improved programmes. The Tech is not expecting to have their budget levels set erm, by the government until towards the end of this month, which means that once again er, there is going to be a rush to get contracts in place before the old ones expire. On Community Action, this is an employment service programme, er, it's got off to a very slow start. Erm,on Friday, there were only six, erm, trainees on the programme. Erm, but quite a lot of work had been done, and there are another twenty four classes going to be this week, erm, staff recruitment is complete, staff training is complete. On the staff side we have recruited nine individuals, er, but since we've lost three members of staff at the same time, that is a net increase of six, and since most of them are part-time, there's actually only three full-time equivalents, we've been able to do that entirely within the we had on establishments at work. Erm, I think the next item that requires an update is redundancy in paragraph eleven, erm, Walters at Ludlow are updating their Bishop's Castle factory, erm, in the last week in February, with a loss of seventy three jobs, arrangements have been er, now made for the first erm, redundancy counselling and job search support course, to start on the twenty fourth of January. Erm, the employment services has agreed to fund that entirely, so it's not erm the company's not having to make any contribution towards it, and very probably there will be a second course a week or two later. Erm, there's also been progress made on, erm, army redundancies. The first pilot residential course has been planned for the twenty first of February, and it's going to take place at C O D at Donnington, and subject to that course working out successfully, erm, the employment service in the army will be working on this, the employment service department asked to deliver the army to post six more courses erm, next year. That's the next financial year. Progress has already, has also been made on erm, the army's pressed for County Council support to launch their Best Trained Workforce of Britain promotion, and, and a day's been set, the twenty second of April, far forward . Erm, in paragraph thirteen, Invest in People, the target date for er, achievement in the award has been delayed from the twenty seventh of, sorry the twenty eighth of February, until the twentieth of May, and the reason for that has been staff effort required to get community action going. It seemed far more important to out and the programmes on the top line, and then the icing on the cake, which is community service. Now, that's all Chairman, the report is for information. Thank you Lance, any comment, questions? I think we should er, minute our approval of thanks to the Tayman team, they are, I think accepted as the most efficient and the best training managers in the County, and it's nothing we do, it's everything that the officers and the staff do. Okay. Item seventeen, Paper P. The Central Sc Screen Commission, Chair. Erm, film's big business, to get a film to come into your area, you spend a lot of money, and it's direct expenditure of the local economy on a combination of food, and provision of supplies, and if it's the right type of film, it can encourage tourism in the medium and long-term. The big cities, New York, London, and Liverpool even, can afford to have units set up to encourage the production of films and videos and so on in their areas, in fact there was a report in last Thurs thirtieth of December's Shropshire Star about Liverpool's office. A hundred and fifty films, television and video productions they've attracted in four years. We obviously can't afford to do that, on that scale, but what we can do, is fund into the regional scr er, screen commission at Birmingham, to their register, where they will hold details on what's available, er, what houses, what large houses are available, things that can be set in, what lo what er, countryside there is, what facilities there are, what firms there are locally that can provide services to for a cost. Excuse me. Now, it's obviously a bit of a gamble, we might give them some money, we might not get anything from it, but we might get a major feature film, or a major television series, which would be very worthwhile indeed. They have asked for two thousand pounds, the Centre have asked for two thousand pounds from all County Councils, but I know that they would accept less if we negotiate that, a lower figure. So erm, the report asks the Committee for their views, because I think it would be a worthwhile thing to do. Well I feel fairly positive this Chair, I look forward to when Brookside is replaced by Victoria Ward, We've got our own Brookside. Oh, right, erm, I think Shropshire's well placed for this sort of work, I remember when Shrewsbury was, was chosen for Christmas Carol, I mean not Stratford, not Chester, not the obvious places that spring to mind, but somewhere different, and I, I think Shropshire may be full of places which are not the obvious place, but which film companies may be able to find if they're shown in the right direction, so I would certainly propose that we, you know, follow this line. Yes I feel, Mr Chairman, Shropshire is the obvious place. Erm, some film producer sitting in London, thinks of a rural county, he'll probably think of Shropshire, and I think this is typical example of how we can dribble away our scarce resources on a couple of thousand here, a couple of thousand there to other bodies, erm, I am, I'm, I'm against this proposal, we'll keep our money for essential items. Mm, well, bread on the waters if not on the waters of the Severn, any other comments? I think Chair, you have to speculate to accumulate don't you? And if you don't, not prepared to promote yourself, then nobody else is going to do it for you, and this is an ideal way of doing it, at, at fairly minimal cost. I would I think we could promote ourselves, Mr Chairman, but what I can say is that I'm against contributing to all these West Midland bodies that probably won't, won't give us any help at all. I, I, I think Chairman, that I, having to put very good money after bad doing it this way, I think it's perfectly true, people think of Shropshire as a rural county, and I think film producers will be people erm, if they want to come here they will and it's hardly Council business, taking huge amounts erm,well known production,but er, quite often major films have been Well, I suspect today didn't ever change anybody's well, no opinion, so if I take Malcolm's, yours, is it a motion that we support the recommendation, is that seconded? Yes, You will presumably, right so those in favour of the recommendation, show One, two, three, four, five Against? Four against. At least if a film does come, we'll see that, if the cameras come in anywhere, we'll see that all-party representation on it. I'll get a job as an extra. Where are we? Erm, eighteen isn't it? Yep, liaison with Wolverhampton, well. Promoting Tech. They need promoting. I think the, the university are always welcome to, always welcome people who, who're interested, and if anyone wants to have a sort of, look round, I'm sure it can be arranged. They're very keen that people should know what they're doing. Item nineteen, annual conference, next Chair, erm, every year we try and hold er, an event or something of interest to the local business community, to local industries, and we have contacts with local freight-forwarders, banks and companies that have exported, embassies, and we're proposing that we erm, hold the event this year on the subject of exporting and how to do it, because we've had very many small companies that might be clueless and want to know erm, exact nuts and bolts of it, so if we could run an event on that basis, and then use that event as the core of a group to take across in this case, Ireland, but perhaps in the future, Holland, who knows where else, to actually sell, using the services of erm, the Embassy in Dublin, our Embassy and the Chamber, with whom we have very good links, then it would be to the benefit of our businesses. Erm, we have experience of this, erm, or officers do, from other authorities, and many small companies are fearful of going out there and exporting. But if they go once with a group, they then go a second, and third and fourth times by themselves. Then we've done our work, I would say that my average of ten company representatives went over, perhaps two would find it was useful, useful fact finding mission, but it didn't achieve much, two would click instantly and have orders while they're there, and the remainder would over the period of six or nine months later, if they worked at it, gain orders or perhaps, perhaps more importantly agents or distributors to sell their products for them in that country. It need not cost, cost the County Council anything at all,right, the combination and so on , we can do it for relatively low cost, and may get financial support, it's a, it's something worth doing to exploit the links that we have with our Embassies and Chambers of Commerce abroad. Sorry, that's my view of commerce, it's an unlimited view. Right, comments? I think it's a very welcome initiative. I'm absolutely amazed Chairman,in Ireland, Yes, indeed, yes, yes, mind you, we make a lot of Guinness in, in Acton you know, you know, we make it over here. Okay, well, we agree the er, the recommendations. Yes, rural development, new designation, yes. This is actually the detailed report of the new R D A and the R D T process which is going ahead this week, and also to the Planning Committee. Erm, I think that the most important point within the, the er, report Chairman, is in paragraph erm, three four, where the Rural Development Commission are, are saying very strongly that if there's more than one area designated within the county and there are now three areas designated within Shropshire, in the past there was only one R D, R D A area, that it all runs through, there are now three separate R D A areas, the, the R D, the Rural Development Commission are recommending very strongly that if you do have that, then they should be managed by a single R DP Committee. And I think I would recommend that, that we support that line. The reason for it is that resources are likely to be allocated to the individual R D P committees, on probably a per capita basis, and if you do that say with a small R D A like the Whitchurch one, it will just barely be possible to do any projects within that area, given the level of resource you've got. So you're better having it within one pool, and then you can decide locally the way your priorities lie within the area. What are the mechanics of, of setting up the, the new body? Well I think it'll probably, in Shropshire terms, largely follow on the existing body, in which there are two County Council representatives on the existing R D T, and I would expect that to continue. I think one's yourself as Chairman of Planning. That's right, any problems with the recommendation? Good next, Otis Centre, Shrewsbury. Shrewsbury request Chairman. Erm, members will be aware of the at the bottom of Abbey Foregate, opposite the Abbey which work is currently under way on, erm initial discussions with County Council officers from E E D department led to some suggestions being made. Shrewsbury and Borough Council have taken up the flagpole, have decided to spend a considerable amount of money on providing a visitor attraction in those buildings, around those buildings. Develop will be erm, shown, but it is not about running it's about medieval Shrewsbury, many towns have these, the Yorvik one's been spectacularly successful, and has been copied in places like Canterbury for those that saw Songs of Praise last night, with even, erm, it is evident that this will be a new visitor attraction for the town with a generation of jobs, permanent jobs in, in that er, facility, it will improve the erm, appearance of main entrance into the town centre, very important in terms of attracting other people in the future, unfortunately the Borough Council haven't quite got enough money, or they tell us. They're asking for a donation of twenty thousand pounds, put that in the context of nearly say six hundred, six hund sorry five hundred and forty thousand pounds that they're spending, and maybe ninety thousand pounds English Heritage are spending, they're asking for us to fund the shortfall. There's a gap of twenty thousand. Now, if we say no, the project will still go ahead, but it will be slightly scaled down, and there will be a meeting later this month to decide how to revise the spec erm, it's possible for example, that the lift to allow disabled visitors to the first floor would not be included if the twenty thousand pounds weren't forthcoming. However, erm, it will go ahead, with or without county funding. It will be enhanced with county funding which will be met by capital funding. Well my own view is subject of course to our budget. Not being too vicious, is that I hesitate to support this, until we see what the level is. Could I just add to that Mr Chairman, that all major local businesses have always, have also been approached for er, sponsorship of this project. It's too early to say yet what the response will be. But I personally, certainly hope that quite a substantial money will come from the local businesses. Mm, mm, I heard an interesting programme on Radio Shropshire which talked about the tailed bat, which brought out the historical importance of the building, and I learnt one or two things that I didn't know, apparently one of the very early carvings, who plays Sidney I think, and yet, yet it wasn't er, destroyed until the next revolution took place. Quite interesting. Does anyone object to giving er, a comparatively small donation when you look at the, the total sum involved? Unanimous? With the comment Chairman, the comment about erm, us having an involvement with the scheme, An acknowledgement an acknowledgement, and acknowledgement in a manner to be agreed, if that really is, I mean if we put our twenty thousand pounds to pay for the lift for the disabled or something like that, No, I think it's just, it's just to ensure that there's a recognition that there have been a number of partners, that have led to the creation of the project. Well, to put it very crudely, in the current unitary authority debate they don't forget that we have helped. Sometimes the districts occasionally, but not always do. If I may, Chair, sorry, erm, if it proves necessary that twe less than twenty thousand pounds is, is requested because local businesses come up with some of it, therefore we presume on that basis we I bet you they'll find a way of spending it all. I'm sure Okay, perhaps the most important item that is the Paper U, which is the budget. Right. Thank you Chair, er, obviously this comes at the end of er, of er, a series of reports where we've put back additional or complementary revenues and the last item, number T, talked about a twenty thousand capital contribution, er, the budget will bring all this together, and if I could just add one erm, update on the first page, where paragraph three, and talk about the provision resource allocation to this Committee being a reduction of fifty thousand from the community based budget. The Policy and Resources Committee on Friday considered the position that included a take, a potential take of fifty thousand for this Committee, and similar reductions from other committees, but which left the funding deficit problem of six hundred and seventy one thousand, and what the Policies and Resources Committee decided was to ask the committees, all committees to look at how this six hundred and seventy one thousand gap would be funded, and that that should include committees like ourselves which had already identified and had put into the guidelines for reduction, the full five percent reduction that had been requested to be identified early in the process. Fifty thousand represents about a five percent reduction. So tell us which are these other committees have identified the five percent. There were three, three Counties, Planning, Trading Standards and Economic Development. Yes, but Trading Standards are part of Public Protection, and if you lump the whole of Public Protection, you don't get five percent do you? No you don't So we are the only Committee who are saving the , that's taking our budget globally as, I think, I think it's four point eight percent, if you want to be pedantic about it, but we are planning and that's the only ones, if you take that mode of view, and if we took, if we took training out I take your point Okay, so these, these are the the fa the facts of the, of the situation, and one of the points about the strategy, er, and perhaps looking further, that was highlighted, was the use of carry forwards, which Chair's already referred to. Ad nauseam It, it is, it, it is seen as a possibility that if you use carry forwards as a way of finding the reductions, A you wouldn't actually reduce a service on the face of it, and you would also, it would also give you a chance to examine where those reductions in services could be found in the coming months, er, rather than take decisions immediately. So, I think that was one of the strands in the course of Resources' decision, that er, we should look and cast the net around again, just to see if there were any way of erm, of finding this six hundred and seventy one thousand without damage to the fabric of services. Can I ask our officer to comment on what would be the effect of reducing our importance have on our, hopefully potential ? Yes, I, I, I think if I could, if I could slightly widen it in my answer Chair, if I may? And deal with the issue actually on the Economic Development Committee budget, because er, I mean in a sense, Economic Development Committee hasn't always played the game, you never know when you're being asked to identify target reductions by an authority, they have found those target reductions, so have the Planning Committee, so have Trading Standards. I mean, in essence it's the small committees at the end of the day which actually find the target and the larger committees at the beginning of the list which don't find them. Now, I know a sum of money of nearly twenty thousand may not seem a lot of money in total, it's not a lot of money in terms of, it can be quite a large sum in terms of doing things with economic development. In nineteen ninety two, three, er, we made er, we made a four percent reduction in economic development, a, a, about erm, about fifty thousand pounds. In nineteen ninety three, four we made a seventy one thousand reduction in economic development, and this year we're proposing to make a fifty thousand,there're actually cuts I think, that any committee of any council has made for the last three years. Erm, and I think Economic Development are actually contributing very fairly to the problems which are facing the County Council. Er, those members Chair, that were actually at the, at the consultation meeting with, with Industry and Commerce last week, actually heard the business representatives in Shropshire saying that the County Council does not spend enough on economic development. It actually should spend more, because it's community, it's helping to create the wealth of the county in the future, and that wealth of the county is what will pay for public services in the future. So there was, there's a lot of sections of the community out, out there in terms of the business community, who have actually indicated that the County Council should be spending more in terms of economic development not less, and they criticized the Commission in terms of identifying some of the reductions which they have made erm, as part of this year's budget alone. But the final thing that happened, if I could draw the point,Chair, is that in the, in the report on the budget strategy ninety four, five, the Policy and Resources Committee on Friday, paragraph thirty five says no provision has been made for the Council's contributions into the European objective five B programme, much of this will be, but some hundred and twenty five thousand pounds of revenue spending per annum is likely to be, is likely to required to match European and other partners' contributions . Now of that hundred and twenty five thousand revenue spending which would be coming out of County Council to match what is likely to happen in the five B programme, most of that, most of that is on economic development activities, now the kind of way we can find that money without going to the authorities and asking for growth funding, because this Committee has not asked for any and that is not common in all the committees in the Council, is actually by finding it out of things like our monies, and other projects, actually funding it yourself as a Committee, funding the ability to draw in European money into Shropshire. Now if you take away er, another lump of money including carry forwards, you really do reduce your own ability to be able to pay to take advantage of the window of opportunity we now have to actually put European money into the county. I mean, it's a double cost whatever you take away, it's likely to cost twice as much because the Europeans will not put in the other half of the money. Is this the point where we, whether Dominic should be making contributions, you know,to give you an example. I don't know Well, Chair, erm, most of my money is under the Resources Management sub-committee, erm, that has been very thoroughly examined, I think the Resources P A G have agreed with me, on the other P A G, and John has written that on to search for saving what I would say, over and above the call of duty. He's done extremely well, and he has a number of reports and examined every possible area. The P A G resources, P A G met on Friday, and they found even further savings in the request to keep . Er, they've taken more carry forwards, in my department and the other central departments, er, they've taken more from building maintenance. So further reductions have been found. All my staffing costs for Smallwood are in that budget, and therefore I can promise Chair, that it would be extremely well examined. May I just point out to members that er, we are making, Smallwood are making a very considerable contribution this time. There is a twelve percent reduction in maintenance, partly because we sold some holdings, partly a cut in the service, it is a, it is a, it's a, it's a legal requirement to maintain the whole thing, under the terms of the agreement, and I'm also, because of the change in our , dropping our, a land agent, now that's a reduction of thirty three percent in the management of the estates, so I really am doing my best and resources quite rightly have held my noose in order to ensure that I do. Any further comment? Only to support Bruce in what he said Mr Chairman, that it is absolutely essential that we do keep some money after to take advantage of five B. I think you mentioned earlier on in the meeting that some authorities haven't taken advantage of European money and we don't want to fall into that trap. Absolutely, yes. It is worth just noting about it, totting up what we've voted to spend, Some of which we voted against There's a total of fifty eight thousand two hund hundred and eighty so far That we've actually voted to spend at this meeting Er, I'm sorry I didn't quite get I think we voted to spend fifty eight thousand two hundred and eighty pounds, at this Committee meeting so far. It's a pity in a way that we didn't have this discussion before, because I do think it's important and I think parties these days, goodness knows what we're matching is to, should be a bit and they want more, sort of less than putting in less fifty percent. Is that saying in another way that perhaps we should push this over to consideration onto the P A G, there aren't any meetings today, but there will be the V A T I suppose. Might have a committee, Chairman, Yes, yes, the onus You've got several new elements in which John 's recommended that unnecessarily ignore the situation. Do we need a P A G though? Can we not reach conclusions today which I sense has some possibility of consensus? It really does come down to, I don't know, I mean, every year we play it very honestly and very straight, and we push him in a position where next year, if there is a next year, I think the last time that we played it straight we got clobbered, so let's pay a little bit less, and keep a bit back for when they come round a second time round. Last year was erm, an additional twenty thousand pounds at the last moment, chickenfeed for the big committees, that's the annoying thing, but what particularly annoys me, and I have to say this, I'll express it is the knowledge that what can be a phenomenal deprivation to this Committee, goes very, very, very little towards solving the major problems that this county faces, it doesn't have a tremendous impact. And yet the impact on us is considerable, and I'm seriously wondering whether the major spending committees ought not to look again at the budgets that they're erm, and I've discussed this with , and obviously education is the big problem, but er, I'm not convinced that erm, the sums of money which we're being asked to pay out, not be taken from the education budget without too dra drastic an effect on the school. Keith. Chair, we have through this, what we've actually s what you're actually saying there, because I, I happen to be of the view that when you ask for identification of five percent across all the committees and then you start to take that quite happily from the smaller spend committee, then clearly you're in a position where you have to address the er, question, do we really want to provide this service at all, and that would be tragic in the case of economic development, because it's so vital to the erm, economic development of the county as a whole, and so, yes, there, I would suggest that there's clearly the need to be a corporate view, and a corporate er, er, will to actually put up resources at your disposal, er, er, especially since five B wasn't actually, although it was it hadn't actually been granted, so it was a bit of an unknown quantity when perhaps the first P A G erm, sat and deliberated. So clearly now, the, there's some merit in looking afresh at it in the light of five B, being able to match the kind of funding that's available there. The funding allowed. Could we not agree today to ask the appropriate committee, whether it be Policy and Resources, the Resources Management of Regional Council, that when they're examining this question of the carry forwards, that they themselves review the impact that this will have on, on the benefits of five B for this County? Now, that's a positive thing. Chairman, can I just venture to s to suggest that the Policy Panel will be the next move surely, Dave, yourself and the chief officers will be doing some formal presentation there and that clearly we need to take the strength from the vote in the Co in this Committee, to support what you've, what you've just said. Yes, Policy Panel and Advisory Panel Well yes indeed, but it covers the influence I, I would totally support the move that you're suggesting Mr Chairman, if we are asked to provide another one percent or whatever can be done, erm, I would suggest that the obvious way to get that money would be to offer them the ten thousand that we agreed to spend this morning. Mhm, I like, on West Mid on West Midland's body, rather than on county bodies, that's not, Yes, not quite what I suggested, but it is a point Mr Chairman, I'm sure it would be made, but I have, that I have made . Five B status would not of course been allowed if this Committee been sitting. This is the first time And yet I think it's the English Commission that abolished the English loans. Five B status is going to bring in two to three million a year over the next five years, the total cost of running the scheme is one point three million pounds, in effect we're a net contributor And have been for years And have been for years, because that doesn't take into account the money that is made when, when you know, when, when, sort of development that we have, we have run from home. Indeed, Valley is one. Yes, I mean it's er, sort of I think it's, our feelings are quite strong about this, in this contest that we're having with the Town Hall, that er, having exposed the five percent in the first place, we have had particular innovation about five B, being articulated as well. We are not subject at this juncture, to identify any further exposures, but that, I mean, that's what we're saying isn't it? Yes, it's not Are we content that that goes forward or, I mean, I don't blame you for, having your little piece about the earlier things, but they really aren't particularly that issue that we're discussion are they? We're happy with that as a way forward? Right, the question of will crop up later on, you know if you haven't just seen the paper. Anything else you want to raise on this matter? Chair, what will, what will happen is that er, there're, there are meetings planned for the Policy Panel on the twenty fourth and twenty fifth of January which will hear the views of all the committees in response to, to the request for P and R, that, that would then be translated into a final proposal for the budget cuts, which will go to the meeting of the Policy and Resources in February. And, my guess is from, from what is being said, is that the Committee will be, the Policy Panel will see this budget book that, with all that entails, and will hear that, although if you look on page three, there are still carry forwards in hand, that they of thirty thousand, er, the Policy Panel will be told that you, you've already thought of ways of spending er, I mean there's thirty eight thousand in total that we've talked about today, well erm, of, of that erm, fifty eight grant that erm, thirty eight of it is revenue, the other twenty thousand relates to the capital project of Centre. Erm, they'll take that into account, if the potential value of thirty thousand but, will state that, that there is really this erm, problem about how to much five B, erm, contributions. Let me put it another way, if we lived in a magic world, and weren't having things like essays and package deals together, and any officer was being asked to forecast the money that would be needed for the sensible and, and virile implementation of five B, would you arrive at a figure of about thirty thousand pounds or not? Now, I'm not an accountant Bob, but you'd need way in excess of thirty thousand Well income revenue of hundred and twenty five thousand a year to manage the potential for getting in on the partners plan. And if that goes into partnership schemes, it probably could be, it could produce three or four times as much money actually in production. So we should be asking the other committees to look after their carry forwards, to give some of their carry forwards to us, to fund five B. And that's the logic of the issue, but it won't work that one, but at least we'll hang on to what we've got, I hope. I think the other problem of course, Chair, with using carry forwards is that that just is a, a one year solution Absolutely that you've then got to deal with the extent to which you've used the ninety four, five, against the five, six one. So it's not one that really, really is a long-term solution. Yes, Erm, the, the only other item on, on the budget book at the, that I particularly want to draw members' attention to, is, are the pink funds, which are . Er, here the Policy and Resources Committee also consider that only brought on capital which again issue guidelines which will be reviewed, at the end of January for a final erm, proposal in February. And those pro the, the guidelines would, if accepted, enable schemes two and three to continue, on the basis that the capital receipts from the sale of the are earmarked for this sort of investments, and that these in their turn will generate a flow of capital receipts which can be ploughed back for the benefit of the to the totality of County Council's capital programme. So that was the, the philosophy behind that particular proposal, that where you've got development works, you take them out of the budget, and the bidding process, and try and get a rolling programme of expenditure and receipts, so that, if that's approved that would deal with two and three. On four, there was a proposal to establish a two hundred and fifty thousand pound contingency capital sum, against which bids could be made for schemes that would bring down action grant, and I would've su thought that scheme number four would be a bid against that two hundred and fifty thousand erm, contingency. Now what, what was left was a guideline for economic development other, of sixty five thousand, which happens to be equivalent to pollution prevention schemes at one, but was certainly not earmarked to anything in particular, it was just a guideline that they were thinking of, and I, I think it would be a help to Policy Panel and Policy and Resources Committee, to obtain a response to that non-identified sixty five thousand pound item. This pollution prevention, is this at smallholding? In in indeed Chair, yes. Do you want to comment on it? It's, it's a r it's an ongoing programme where they have sixty five thousand in, into er, deal with small problems, problems of a capital nature, but the far fixed er, man is pollution prevention, which is basically a legal requirement to stop effluent going into the stream and the like. We don't spend it unless we have to, we seek to persuade the tenants to contribute towards it, indeed even if we contribute, we get a rent back on it. So we do our best with that. But with the sales of that are going on, there are needs to move tenants around and make alterations to boundaries and buildings, as we split up holdings, so I would say Chair, it's essential that we have something in the kitty to do this work, I mean, it's obviously far exceeded by the capital receipts that the revue is generating. Well does that help you? Well I think I'm, covered around the heating out, you ain't going to get anything out of the juice in the pollution prevention basically. I don't think we, we can. Well, what I think Chair, all, all that you can say to the Policy Panel then is, they take their recommendation on to Sir, is Miss not in? No. Could you take your coats off please and come into the blue room. Well who's taking Miss 's class? question? What? the answer. Can you come through please. Right folks Donald is here making typical of English in use from schools at the moment. So if you would er ignore the presence of the microphone that would be helpful. I intend to give you a demonstration today based on work that Kevin has done. He's his plate with hard wax as many of you now have done. He has varnished the back with, can you remember what sort of special old varnish it was? Straw hat. Correct. Well done. Straw hat varnish. Now it's safe from acid attack on the back and on the front except for where he has lightly drawn through the thin wax coating using the etching . Drawn this little character and what I intend to do is put this into acid and etch it. The actual etching process where the acid bites through the liner into the metal and makes a rule. When that's happened I'll take it out of the acid clean it and show you how to take a print from the plate. I would like you all to try to remember the stages of
