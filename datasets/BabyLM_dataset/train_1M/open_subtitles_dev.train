the amount will be 500,000. And this is just the first instalment. Look.. look, till you don't meet me I won't give you a single.. Hello! Hello! Hello! Come. Please do come, Mr. Aditya Malhotra. Mr. Malhotra? - Yes. Kelly Dorjee.. investigating officer. I wanted to talk to you about Mr. Singhania's murder. Murder! ? But Mr. Singhania's death was.. Wasn't because of drugs overdose. Instead the killer made an attempt to mislead the police. Yes.. but how can I help you in this? Rather we're here to help you, Mr. Aditya. Right now Mr. Singhania's wife leads our suspects' list. She has killed her husband with such ease.. ..that it should appear to be suicide. But why are you telling me all this? Because Mrs. Singhania is young and stunning. And if she decides.. then she can lead anyone astray. I really don't understand what you all want to say. I'll explain you. You're a nice human being. And you're working for Ria Singhania. Right? - Yes. And I've come to tell you that it would be better if this issue.. Not this. Here.. here.. From here. Eat. Adi, he has grown up. Let him eat. - lt's okay. I'm his father. Yeah, from here. Drink it. Don't leave it. Just finish it. Yes. is she your acquaintance? No.. the manager isn't my acquaintance.. - Manager! ? Eat, man! Eat it! I.. I'll go to the toilet and be right back. - Leaving the food? I think I'm having loose motions. What are you doing? Angry with me? Not at all. Then why didn't you come to meet me? If Diwakar has told you that I'm here.. ..then he might have as well told you.. ..as to how important my family is for me. Ria.. look, my family is waiting for me.. Look, I promised to Neha.. What are you doing? ! Ria.. I'm quenching my thirst! I am sorry. My wife's there! Sorry! You've been a very good boy. Now very lightly. Hey! You had your food? - Yes, papa. Then who'll join daddy? - You took so long? The food has gone cold. - Yes, no.. ..actually the stomach's upset. The situation's a bit bad. Now you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Hello, sister-in-law. - Hi, Diwakar. Hello, Aditya. - Man, what are you doing here? I got a bit late. Did you see Ria? Who's this Ria? Hi, Aditya. - Hi, Ria. Hi, Aditya. - Hi, Ria. Wife? - Yeah, yeah.. my wife, Neha. And my new client, Ria. And he's.. what's.. what's his name? - Diwakar. Yeah, yeah, Diwakar. You know him. Shall we go, Diwakar? - But dinner? The thing that I like.. I think I won't get it today. Let's go. You go in.. I'll get back a document from the office. At this hour? - Yeah.. I struck me now. Actually I've to work over it at night. lt's a bit urgent. Okay. Ria! Ria! What do you think of yourself? ! What was the need to come over there? ! I had actually gone there for a meeting. You knew it.. you knew that I was there with my wife and kid! Look.. what if Neha got to know about this? But she didn't come to know? What should I do? My heart felt like seeing you.. and I had to pay heed to it. Why? ! Why are you doing all this? ! Should I tell you one thing? If you will refuse to meet me.. ..probably I'll come straight to your house. Yes? Will you speak up? ! Please don't scream, sir. If your wife wakes up then she'll needlessly ask you questions.. '..as to why are you late? Where were you all this while? ' 'And how come the buttons are broken? ' Etc, etc. What do you want? - l've told you. Fine. You'll get the money. But I want the photos and the negatives as well. Together. You'll get the photos as I get the first instalment. And as far as the negatives are concerned.. ..they are your trust with me. To hell with that? ! Tell me the whole price! Don't scream! Your life is very precious for me. Breathing is no doubt essential for life. But the span of life doesn't get elongated.. ..if you take all the breaths along. You keep giving money. And I'll keep you giving your breaths. Who was that? That was a contractor. He was asking me about the money.. ..for those Magnum hoardings at Juhu. Where were you? I called up at the office and.. ..I was told that you left it four hours back. I called you up on your mobile.. and it was switched off. At least tell me and go where.. ..I should contact you if there's an emergency. Oh my God! Not even the Judge asks this many questions in the court to a killer. I'm not making you stand in the court! I just want to tell you.. Aryan fell off the stairs while climbing up! He's hurt! - What? ! Aryan! - Don't wake him up! He has fallen asleep with great difficulty after having a pain-killer. Adi.. ..you used to work earlier as well.. ..but don't know why.. ..I feel this work is taking you far from us. If you feel that we're a hindrance in your work.. ..and that we are not needed for you.. ..then I'll go to my papa's house with Aryan. Fine, fine.. As you like. What do you mean 'as you like'? ! I'm talking about leaving the house.. ..and you're not at all bothered about it? ! Then what should I do? ! What should I do? ! Should I beg to you? ! Should I bow before you? ! Should I plead to you to stay in your own house? ! I'm fed up! I'm.. The days are not like earlier. Neither the nights are like earlier. Perhaps.. there're.. ..some issues between us. The days are not like earlier. Neither the nights are like earlier. Perhaps.. there're some issues between us. What's the matter with me.. ..he doesn't even see me. How am I.. ..he doesn't even ask me that! Seems there's someone else around you. Perhaps.. there's some issue between us. The days are not like earlier. Neither the nights are like earlier. Just don't know.. ..where this bend has brought us! Seems someone else.. ..has penetrated within! Ever since you were with me every moment. Perhaps.. there's some issue between us. The days are not like earlier. Neither the nights are like earlier. The days are not like earlier. Neither the nights are like earlier. Perhaps.. there're.. ..some issue between us. I knew you'll come! I'm so happy! Ria.. ..I want to say something to you. Actually.. Quietly tap your lips with mine and let that word go in. We've a whole life to talk and hear! Let's not wait! - Ria, I'm serious! Look into my eyes.. ..I feel like enclosing you in them! Look at these lips.. ..they have so much longing for you! Look at this face! It's so much in relief.. since you're in my life! Ria. Whatever you happened between you and me.. ..that was a mistake on my part. I've a wife and.. - Oh c'mon, Aditya! Give her a divorce! What? ! I've lot of money, Aditya. Give them as much they want. I'm ready to bear their expenses of the whole life. Just for once.. for once come to me! Shut up! Want to buy my wife and my kid with your money? ! The woman whose place you want to take.. ..loves me thousand times more than you! And listen carefully.. ..I don't love you.. but my wife! What did you say? ! You love your wife? ! Where did that love disappear that day.. ..when you had slept with me? ! You're no toddler who can be forced to make love! You were very much willing! And now you say.. that was your mistake? ! Rather I forgot that I was in love with such a man.. ..who cannot belong to anyone! The one who can betray his wife for another woman.. ..how can he be faithful to me? ! What do you want to prove by hitting me? ! That you're a man? ! You're not even worthy of anyone's love! As yet you've just seen my love.. but now.. Get out! Hello. I do recognise the sound of your breath. What happened? Aren't able to sleep or is it that you're repenting? I want to meet you.. right now. It's over. Whatever that was between us.. it's over. Who is it, sweetheart? Not is.. but was. Whom are you talking to? No.. that.. I was calling someone. Now you'll teach me as to what's marketing? ! What's your position? ! 10,000? ! 20,000? ! 40,000? ! Whatever you earn in a month.. ..I spent the same thing on my driver's uniform! Enough! Diwakar, tell her that we're no more interested in her campaign! We can no more tolerate her uncouth behaviour! She can go to any other Ad agency! Diwakar.. you didn't tell her? - Actually I.. Let it be.. I'll tell her. Ms. Sonia.. whatever you wanted to pay.. ..for this company's shares.. ..I've bought those shares at double the price. This.. What's all this, Diwakar? What could I've done? She gave such an offer.. that I couldn't refuse it. I give offers as such that none should be able to refuse it. From today on the person who obeys me.. shall stay over here! How can she just walk in and take over like this? ! I didn't expect this from Diwakar. We worked so hard and brought this Ad agency at this level and she.. She'll relish the fruits of our hard work! Bloody hell! She's gone crazy. You don't worry. Your hard work won't go in vain. Neither you've to leave this company. If anyone can teach her a lesson.. then it's only me. You just wait and watch.. what I do to this girl. It was great fun. It was a nice play, isn't it? Papa! - Hi, son! Mariam, take Aryan upstairs. - Yes, ma'am. C'mon, Aryan. Good night, mama. - Good night. Good night, papa. - Good night. Where did you both go? To show a play to the child.. ..so that his mind gets diverted. From what? From the drama that's going on in the house. Aryan feels that.. ..there's some tension between us. And you? What do you feel? I've stopped feeling that way, Adi. Now I just think like the mother of a six year old kid. And you.. no matter you don't stay like a husband.. ..at least try living like a good father. 'From today on the person who obeys me.. shall stay over here! ' 'l was in love with such a man..' '..who cannot belong to anyone! ' 'The one who can betray his wife for another woman..' '..how can he be faithful to me? ! ' 'You're not even worthy of anyone's love! ' 'From today on the person who obeys me.. shall stay over here! ' 'The one who can betray his wife for another woman..' '..how can he be faithful to me? ! ' 'You're not even worthy of anyone's love! ' 'You're not even worthy of anyone's love! ' Ria! Ria! What do you want now? I want to talk to you. What do you think of yourself? ! is this what love is for you? ! Not even a day passed since I left you.. ..and you found someone else so soon? ! You simply know to use people! You know what? ! It was my fault that I fell for your words! Because of you.. I betrayed my wife and kid! Because of you.. life became hell for me! Why are you quiet? Reply me! Don't you've anything to say? ! Hey! You're quiet after making my life hell? ! What do you want to prove? ! You came into my office.. ..and you got Sonia thrown out.. ..and you took over my office? ! Want to teach me a lesson? ! What lesson do you want to teach me? ! I'm.. I'm a bloody married man! I've a child! I've a wife! Now you've got the whole thing. Now you've got the idea.. what's the feeling.. ..when you don't posses something despite having it? Now you've got the idea.. what I went through.. ..when you left me behind that day! You say that I used you? Fine then.. I used you! As yet I've just taken over your company.. ..but for the sake of teaching you a lesson.. ..let alone your company.. I can as well.. ..divide you from your wife and your child! How dare you hit me again? ! Get out of my house! I'll call the police! Ria! - Leave me! I said get out of my house! Adi! What happened? You're drunk? ! - No.. How did you get hurt? ! Who hit you? ! Are you okay? ! Where is he coming from? ! What happened, Adi? ! You come in! Come in! Talk to me, Adi! How did this happen? ! What exactly happened? ! Killed very mercilessly. - Who can do it? Whoever the killer was.. he knew Ria Singhania very well. The door wasn't broken.. rather it was opened. The murderer entered in at Ria's will. He sat here.. ..and after that.. he initiated with his plan. The body suggests that the murder took place 3-4 hours back. That means.. the murder took place.. ..somewhere between 9:30 and 10:00, isn't it? - Hmm. Sir.. the watchman has come. Where were you? Last night I was out for two hours to meet my sister. Her father in law has come from Saharanpur to get himself treated. I was supposed to be here by 1 1 :00. But don't know why.. I stayed back because of the weather conditions. And when around 2:00 or 2:15.. when I was back.. ..I saw madam's car was parked outside.. ..and the door was open.. so I came here.. ..to explain my position to the madam.. ..and I saw the madam's body in here. These photographs suggest that before her murder.. ..there was some manhandling with Ria. But the truth is something else. The murder took place.. but not forcibly.. ..whatever happened.. happened at her will. It's quite clear.. ..that the killer knew Ria Singhania.. ..and was very close to her.. ..there was a fight between them.. ..and he killed her painstakingly. And left the room in such a condition.. ..that would suggest that the killer was Ria's foe. You told that you didn't meet Ria since past three days. - Yes. She might have at least called you up? No. And you? No. 'Hello, Ria..' '..are you listening? ' 'You're not doing the right thing! You'll repent it! ' 'What do you think of yourself? ' ls this.. your voice? - Yes, I did call her. But that.. that.. that.. that doesn't prove anything! That doesn't prove that I killed her! Then why did you tell a lie? Because.. my wife doesn't know anything about it. I didn't want to hurt Neha. I just want to.. keep her out of this.. that's it. I see. I've a suggestion for you.. ..if you tell all this to Neha as of now.. ..then maybe the shock might be slighter for her. What happened? Huh.. no.. the papers.. Looking for something? - No.. I was looking for the office documents. Huh! ? At this nightly hour? Yes, there was some work. Adi.. - Huh? is everything alright? - No.. yeah, yeah.. Ria has been murdered. At her house. The police think that I.. Someone's trying to frame me! I.. I want to say something to you.. I know it. - What! ? I know that you used to work with her.. ..so it's obvious that you'll be suspected. People will ask all sorts of questions. The police will harass. But.. you don't worry.. I trust you. I know how my Adi is. I'm with you. I'm with you. Adi! The police have come! Yes? Any problem? Arrest warrant. We've come here to arrest Aditya Malhotra.. ..for the murder of Ria Singhania. What? What bullshit are you talking? We're not talking bullshit.. rather we're doing our work. Ask your husband where was he after 10 o'clock that night. What's there to ask about? I'm telling you.. ..he was with me. - lt's a very good thing.. ..that you love your husband very much.. ..but we need to work in our own parameters set by the law. The evidence found during investigation.. ..hints at Mr. Aditya's involvement. I'm sorry, Mr. Malhotra.. ..I told you earlier as well.. ..tell all this to your wife as soon as possible. I'm sorry. Now I'll have to arrest you right in front of her. What are you doing? ! You might have misunderstood the whole thing! He can never do such a thing! The evening will certainly come.. ..and the sun will set as well. Tell me.. O' vagabond heart.. ..where will you go then? Where will you go then? Don't know what the mistake I committed was? Life seems to have got very much annoyed with me. Don't know what the mistake I committed was? Life seems to have got very much annoyed with me. Committed some mistake! Life seems to have got very much annoyed with me. The evening will certainly come.. ..and the sun will set as well. Tell me.. O' vagabond heart.. ..where will you go then? Where will you go then? I.. wanted to say something to you at night itself.. ..but I wasn't able to say. I kept mum since I dreaded that I'll lose you both. I'm not even worthy of a pardon.. ..if possible then do forgive me. But I.. I didn't kill anyone. Believe me. If you've a bit of trust.. ..there's a lawyer.. Milind Mehta.. ..who saved Ria from her husband's murder. Try meeting him. He can bail me out of here. Okay.. I'm.. I'm sorry. Trust I'm not the murderer! I love you! Hey! I love you! Look, madam, I can understand your sentiments. And I'll try my best.. but I won't make any promise. Mr. Mehta, it's possible for you. And you saved Ria as well in her husband's murder case. Despite all the evidence and the police being against her. I've total faith in you. Moreover it's just a matter of bail. Please.. don't say no. Mrs. Malhotra, I'm a lawyer.. ..and I can do this much as to get the bail for your husband.. ..but after that.. to get an acquittal in Ria's murder.. ..it depends.. it's depends on the opposition.. ..what all witnesses do they have.. and the evidence. Look, try to understand it. Let's go step by step. Your Honour, this case is clear as mirror. It's crystal clear. The murder spot.. and the guilty person's fingerprints over there.. ..Sonia's written statement.. ..they are enough to prove that Aditya Malhotra's the culprit. One more thing.. ..according to Sonia.. there was a physical relationship.. ..between Aditya Malhotra and Ria. Despite being married.. he carried on with this affair. Anyway.. ..I just want to say that probably Aditya.. ..fell in love with Ria all unawares. He fall out with Ria.. and he couldn't bear this fact. And two days prior to the murder.. ..in an inebriated state.. he told Sonia.. ..that very soon he'll teach her a lesson.. ..and he did teach her a lesson, Your Honour! By killing Ria Singhania! I would request the court to give the.. ..severest of punishments to such a criminal! That's all, Your Honour. Your Honour, it seems Mr. Saxena is in quite a hurry. If he can have his way.. he can send the criminal to the gallows.. ..even before he could reach the court. Sir.. before presenting my own witnesses before the court.. ..I would like to cross examine his witnesses. Foremost.. I would like to call Ms. Sonia in the court. How do you know Aditya Malhotra? I and Aditya work in the same Ad agency. I'm sorry. We used to work. But as far as I know.. you left that Ad agency long back. Am I right? - Right. And he was the reason for it. The moment he drew closer to Ria.. ..he started provoking Ria against me. And Ria, after falling for his words.. ..threw me out of there after buying all the company shares. Oh! By the way.. since when do you know Ria Singhania? Since she engaged our Ad agency to make ads for her. And her husband.. Mr. Amit Singhania? I'm asking you about Mr. Amit Singhania.. ..who was murdered on the 6th of July.. ..since when do you know him? ! That.. I.. I didn't knew him. Your Honour.. I would like to summon the watchman.. ..who used to work for Mr. and Mrs. Amit Singhania. Yes, sir. Sonia madam often used to come to meet Mr. Amit. In the presence of Ria madam or in her absence? Sonia madam used to come.. when Ria madam used to go out. Would you like to ask something, Mr. Saxena? Sir.. these are the bills of those hotels.. ..wherein Ms. Sonia spent her nights with Mr. Singhania. If need be.. then I'll present the staff.. ..over there in the court to testify. Mr. Aditya Malhotra was a man fallen for circumstances. Not he.. but Ria trapped him in her love. I regret, Your Honour, instead of reaching to the real killer.. ..the police are making an innocent man a scapegoat. To prove my client's innocence.. ..I would ask for some more time from the court.. I request the court to grant him bail till the next hearing. Bail is granted! I won't be able to go to the court with you on the next hearing. is there some appointment in the hospital? No.. But.. the things that I want to forget.. And I just can't bear it! It's difficult to live with.. I know. Without you.. I'll feel very lonesome. is it true, Officer Kelly.. ..that you went to Mr. Malhotra's office to warn him? I just went to caution him. - From whom? From Ria. During the investigation of Amit Singhania murder case.. ..I came across the fact that Ria used to.. ..make relationships with people just for her benefit.. ..and the moment she had her way with them.. ..she used to get rid of them. So you went to explain Mr. Aditya that after having her.. ..way with him she'll get rid of him just like her husband? is that right, officer? Look, I won't say anything about something that hasn't been proved. And I dreaded that she might hurt Aditya in some way or the other. Thank you, officer. Here it is, officer. Now I don't want any excuses. Show these photographs in the court.. ..and get the maximum punishment for the killer. But how did you find these photographs? I received a phone call. The person asked me for some money.. ..and I found these photographs from his said location. Will you want to tell me where did you find these photographs? I just want to see Ria's killer hanging by the noose. And any help that you want from me.. I'm ready to come forward for it. You Honour.. these photographs.. ..these photographs were clicked the night.. ..Ria Singhania was murdered. Your Honour.. if you see these photos closely.. This proves, Your Honour, half an hour before the murder.. ..the accused was very much present there! And, Your Honour.. ..this man's trying to tell the court and the police.. ..that he doesn't know anything.. he's trying to fool everybody! Whereas he's the one who killed Ria Singhania! That's all, Your Honour. Mr. Malhotra.. do you want to say anything in your defence? Yes. It's true that I went to Ria's house that night.. but.. ..the biggest truth is that.. I didn't kill Ria. The night that Ria was murdered.. that night.. I want to talk to you. What do you think of yourself? ! I can divide you from your wife and your child! Get out of my house! Nothing more happened that night between us. I don't know who killed Ria.. ..but I do know, sir, that someone's trying to frame me. He's telling a lie, Your Honour! He's telling a lie! He's trying to mislead the court by telling a lie! I object, Your Honour. Mr. Saxena isn't even giving my client a chance to speak. Whereas even this evidence of his is incomplete. He hasn't even told the court as to who clicked these photographs. Your Honour.. had my client wanted.. ..then he would have proved these photographs as fakes.. ..by saying that it's trick photography but he didn't. Because he wants to help the law. He wants to lead the law to the real culprit. Sir.. that wasn't my love.. it was just a fixation. Don't know why I was drawn towards her. I wish she hadn't come into my life. I wish I had refused to go to her house. I wish I hadn't hidden anything from my wife. Sir.. if at all I'm someone's culprit.. ..then I'm only of my wife's. And if someone's in a position to punish me.. ..then it's only my wife. I didn't break any law. I didn't kill anyone. Sir.. I cannot stay apart from my wife and kid after going to jail! I love them! I love you! The court needs the police's help to reach to the bottom of the case. And it orders the police to present that photographer.. ..anyhow in the courtroom. Now only that photographer can save you. And if we're unable to reach to the photographer.. ..then consider that we've lost the case. How can we reach to the photographer? Listen.. I'll help you out. - But you! ? Till date I misunderstood you.. but whatever you said in the court.. ..I'm very much certain by that.. that you're innocent. I cannot withdraw this case. But I do have the serial numbers of those currency notes.. ..that can reach you to that photographer. This is the place where he'd asked me to keep the money.. And I'll get my photographs here.. But this is a very big market.. How will we know where he had come from? There are many photo developing.. ..shops in this shopping area.. I think we should check each and every photoshop. We might as well get some clues. Why don't we start from that shop? There.. We've got it.. these notes have the same series.. Where did you get this note from? How can one remember.. who has given it and who hasn't.. That's why we have brought you this list. So, if anybody gives you a 100 rupee note.. ..just check if the series match with these. And if it matches then call us immediately. - Okay! And yes our numbers have also been jotted down here.. Yes, I have understood now sir. The numbers are matching.. I just hope.. ..he comes to the shop and the shopkeeper calls us. Just pray for it! We just have two more days after that.. ..the judge will give his verdict.. So, just pray for it.. Adi, nothing will happen to you.. cause.. ..you haven't done anything. I'm sure.. nothing will happen to you, okay! The police haven't been able to find that photographer.. But we have enough evidence against Mr. Aditya Malhotra.. And taking in to account all these evidences.. The courts announces the verdict that Mr. Aditya Malhotra.. One minute, Your Honour! Your honour, he's the blackmailer who had snapped.. ..photographs at Priya's residence that night. Your name? - Chandan Verma! Have you snapped these photographs? Yes! - Why? - I just kept picturing Henry yapping. - They're saying it's justifiable. They're talking about a medal. Still, it's weird. In 30 years, I never pulled a trigger. You did what was necessary. We stick together and just go forward from here. Killing can have an effect on a man. Guilt is a corrosive agent. - I think we can trust him. - Why is that? Because now he has just as much to lose as we do. Miami? Heard you had a little problem at the Colorado. - Can you help me find an easy game? - No way. Phil. Just 'cause you're on Don Everest's bad side doesn't mean I have to join you. Funny, you didn't strike me as the type who scared easy. Oh, "scared. " It's not about fear. It's about cash. Everest puts the mark on you. Word gets out. The whole town knows he's not Mr. Clean. The town don't count. What counts is me making money. - Huh. And here I thought we were friends. - Please. You're a good-looking broad who kept idiotic losers at my tables while they thought they had a chance of banging you at the end of the night. But friends? I don't think so. - Hey! - Hey! - Jeez. Damn. - Look, you're finished! All right? Don't ever come around... - Hey, that's a nice watch, pal. - All right. Manners, huh? Where have they gone? Yeah. Randy Joffa. - Miami. I could have handled that. - I believe it. Still, I was raised the right way. You don't remember me, do you? I know who you are. Everybody knows the Joffa brothers. - You own half the strip. - Not half. 18%. But you know, maybe someday. So you know who I am, but you don't remember me. Hmm. - You cleaned me out. - Two years ago. - No limit at commerce. - There you go. - But you still came to my rescue. - Well, I'm a good loser. And you won with a lot of style. - I'm bored. You hungry? - No. Not tonight. Maybe tomorrow night? I don't think I'm gonna be around that long. Hmm. Just in case. - Living the high life? - Why should I trust you? - Does this look like county lockup? - Looks like a setup. Yeah, all right, fair enough. I think I might see it that way from where you're sitting. OK, let me lay it out for you. I worked with Don Everest for a long time and I always knew eventually he'd screw me over. So that day is here. The problem for him is that I'm not the guy to just let him crap all over me and just move on. Running out of options. He owns the cops. Yeah, he does. And he's tough. And he's shrewd. But he's not invincible, and he can only fight so many battles at the same time. Is that your plan? Malloy's gonna put him up as my replacement. That's one opening for us, 'cause the truth is, Everest has always had a piece of the hotel off the books. - We get the IRS to look into that. - OK, Eliot Ness, so you just ring 'em up and say, "We got you a new Al Capone"? It's not that simple. We get some press and rattle his cage. You get some ink on it, you get the right sort of people looking into it. I want him for killing my brother, not playing with money. All right. Next front. I've tried to keep as good a list as I could of all the horses he's used to set up games. You work those guys. You only need a handful to sing the same song. At least I won't be fighting by myself anymore. No, you won't. Then we'll make allies. Then we'll smack the crap out of Mr. Everest from all sides. Look at you, man. Raging Bull, huh? You ain't even pretty no more. Yeah, I heard they gored your ass out pretty good, man. But you know what? If you're gonna get your clock cleaned, it might as well... Yeah, I know. It might as well be by the best. I find real solace in that, Ricky. Thanks. - You got it? - Yeah. I got it. - All right. - Yeah. Well, look here, you know that, uh... that blond thing you run with? She calls herself Miami. Yeah. I was thinking maybe I'd get a little introduction, you know. - You and her are just business, right? - I don't know what's going on with Miami. - Except you couldn't handle her. - Yeah. What the hell are you so spooked about? Just thought I saw somebody I knew, that's all. All right. I know you've been down this road before, but you know I gotta say it. It's like a professional disclaimer, right? You know with these cats, patience is never a virtue. - I know the drill. - All right. All right, I'm just saying, 'cause there's been a whiff of I don't know man, like, desperation around you lately. What are you getting at? The juice on this one is three points, not two. ? Let's up the ante so we can win ? Igotmycardsonthetable ? Deal me in ? Yeah, I've been a gambler all my days ? This is the roughest I've ever played ? You've got to play the hand you're dealt ? This is the luckiest I've felt Spiffy, aren't you? True style never goes out of style. They do say that style can be something to hide behind. - That so? - Yeah, people lacking substance, they get all slicked up to distract us from what's missing. I'll raise 500. Call. You know, like common decency. The trouble these days is people dress like mutts, somehow they think it doesn't reflect badly on them. - Like loyalty. - Take time to dress nice, shows you respect yourself. Like a soul. I raise 500. A thousand. I have to raise you here. You might want to take another look at those cards. Oh, you're gonna raise me? A little late for that. A day late, dollar short, baby. That's my motto. Takes two to tango. You ever have an original thought? Call. All in. Yeah, let's do it. - Chop. - See that? We get to share. You must be Eddie. Dad, what the hell are you doing back in town? - Yeah. - You're late already. Everyone knows things didn't go your way the other night at the casino. - Who is this? - Listen, you better have a payment plan. - What? I don't owe you anything. - You committed, then you bailed out. That was your decision. You still owe. Besides, you're on the hook if we say you're on the hook. - And this is "we" as in who? - Listen, I don't want... - Look, we gotta deal with this another time. - We friggin' better. It's pretty damn impressive, Clark. Looks like you're a hell of a numbers man. I'm just curious, these last two years, there's nothing here. - I was traveling. - Traveling? Yes, through Africa. Oh, I see. Kind of a... get back-to-the-roots type trip, huh? - Not really. - I always wanted to go over there. Did you get to check out any of them safaris? I grew up in Jersey. - We had that jungle habitat. - No, no. I was volunteering. Right. Well, lots of poor, I guess, huh? So what brings you back home? You ever get to the point where you know that it's time for a change? Yeah, sure. What I want right now is to be the top broker at Mullin Securities and I think that you need me just as much as I need you. You see, now, that is the attitude I love. Clark, just so you know, everyone here starts the same. That means cold calls till your lips turn blue. It's churn 'em and burn 'em, baby. And we don't work on a fee basis. It's all commission, all the time. My mother always told me I could sell milk to a cow. - All right, then. Welcome aboard. - Thank you. There used to be this old Vegas family owned the Colorado. - Little bit before your time. - Yeah. Spawn of which was a fella named Billy Landry. - Always heard he was a good man. - Anyway, Malloy buys the place, right? Everest, he's out here and plugged in, so Malloy figures he needs him. Gives him a piece of the action - off the books, of course. I don't know, people said 12%, but my best sources said seven, seven and a half tops. Anyway, now they got to worry about keeping the commission at bay. So Malloy's no fool. He sticks Landry in as president and bingo, everything is peachy. Short story long, Landry decides he doesn't like the way they operate. Starts mouthing off, making all kinds of noise he's gonna exercise a buyback clause or something. I don't know. Even called me two or three times, trying to get a story rolling. All I know is, last time I see the man, he told me he was going to meet Seymour Annisman. - Then? - Then? Landry's the new Jimmy Hoffa. No, I'm sorry, fellas. No deal. - You still won't write this up? - About Everest? - Yeah. - Nah, I don't think so. Ernie, thanks. - Thank you. - See, I got this bad habit. It's called breathing. I kinda got used to it and I'd like to keep it up. Gentlemen. Angela? - Surprised? - Yeah. I can't believe this was all about Wayne. - Come on, honey. - The brother you'd go six, eight months at a time without talking to? How often you talk to your sister up north? My sister up north, whose name is Sarah, by the way, never faked her own wedding to drum up cash and gifts to blow gambling. He was sick, but he was getting better. You wanted money? I sold the Winchester and the log splitter and I put your fly rod on eBay. - Angela, not my T-3? - Lee. You need to hurry the hell up and come home. I'm running out of lies to tell the kids. Come here. - Clark. - Whoa, whoa! - You OK? - Blake. Yeah, it's just that these places kind of give me the creeps. We've got security cameras all over the joint. That's good, that's good. Feel better already. - You had a good first day? - Yeah. Everything was great. I gotta run. - All right. - See ya later. Can you stay for a couple of days? It's a lonely place. Lee you know I have to get back to the kids. I know. Just remember that what you have is as important as what you lost. What the hell do you want? I was Seymour's friend. Give me a minute. When I called to check in, Seymour told me about you and your brother. He said you were like a bad tooth in his mouth. It wasn't your fault, though, but you kept getting in his way every time he tried to eat. He also said that you were a good man. He told you all that? Seymour treated me good. Just like I was regular. So you came back to do the right thing? That's right. You know, you're not the only one who has issues with the Matador. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. We were working with some others. A player named Miami... Here you go. Anything else? Miami, Clark Marcellin, Eddie Towne. I know Towne. He's one of Matador's boys. Not really. I'm listening. The main event is coming, and it's time to fill up the stables. I need 30 fresh horses, guys who like their buy-ins paid for, can handle themselves at the table, and take out some tough players. They drop their stacks to me along the way for a cut. 30 new guys? That's impossible. Why can't we just use the regulars? We need new faces. Guys that have no connections to us whatsoever. You'll find 'em. - Just be honest with me. - Aren't I always? You gave Dad my ten grand. Your grandmother called. Your cousin Arlene got herself into USC. What, a suit, a smile, that all it took? - You don't know him the way I do. - No kidding. He left when I was seven. - He's not a bad man, Eddie. - Sure he isn't. Good guys, they ditch their wife and kid all the time. I mean, what makes him so great? He didn't pull a Scott Peterson? The way he used to walk into a room, every head would turn. Didn't I ever tell you about the time that he took me to The Plaza for my birthday? - Real class. - You skipped that one. You told me about the time he took you to Atlantic City for St. Patty's Day. You remember that? You remember how you flew down in that helicopter, and by the time you had changed to go out, and you'd freshened up, he had busted on the crap table and you were on a bus back home. He has a good heart, Eddie. How many times he hock your engagement ring? He won it back every time. Well, he's shacked up at the Western with some bimbo. She's tall, blond, about my age. Holy crap, Mom. You still love him. God, he suckered you out of my money. Oh, no. Don't... don't tell me you slept with him. Some guys just aren't cut out for the settled life. Most guys just live up to their responsibilities. Is that right, Edward? Well, that's funny, 'cause I don't see you heading down that road any time soon. - I'm scared, man. - Hey. I understand. But what'll you do when the Feds get involved and start building a RICO case? They can get me for erasing that tape? That's a crime? Obstructing an investigation into multiple homicides. They cast a big net with a RICO case. Catches all size fish - big, small, whale or minnow. You get charged for the same case, you do the same time. - Multiple? - Come on, you're a young man. 60, 70 years with modern medicine, you may even live to get out. What do I have to do? You still have your Colorado pass key? - Table is ready, Mr. Joffa. - Thank you. - Where is everybody? - I promised you a nice, quiet meal. - OK, Mr. Big Shot. - No, it's not like that. I just like my privacy. Should we look at a menu? Oh, Peter, the chef, is a friend of mine. He always does something special for me. OK, how many times a week do you do this? - Is this your big move? - I meant when I come to eat here regularly. - Uh-huh. - Thank you. Oh, do you... do you have any objections to an '87 Bordeaux? - As long as it's wet. - Good. I'm glad you called me. - I'm late. Sorry, Daddy. - Sit down. I said sit down! I'm not that late. You just had to go sleep with him, didn't you? You had to get involved. You didn't seem to have a problem with it before. Well, I did. Maybe I just didn't show it. I'm not Mommy. You can't run my life. That may be so, but as long as you're here in this town, you're gonna do exactly what I tell you. You liked that I was close to Eddie. You pushed us together and it helped you. - I didn't tell you to sleep with him. - Hazard of the job. Come here. Listen, you keep an eye on that punk. Keep him in line, and that's it. Nothing more. You follow? - Eddie doesn't dance for anybody. - He did plenty of dancing for me. You took his money and you beat him down and now you want me to feast on his bones? What kind of a threat is he to you? Why can't you just leave him be? ! Come here. Listen. Only a fool underestimates a wounded animal. OK? Here it is. The one of Everest taking out a black dude and a blond chick. Good. Is it the only copy? We don't make copies as a rule. That's my special job. Probably be good if you just don't show up to work anymore. Wait a second. You said if I helped you out, I'd be in the clear. In the clear with me, but as far as Everest goes, it'd be best if you just vanish into the desert. Oh, this has been fun. I needed a distraction. Oh, is that all I am? - It's all I can handle right now. - Boyfriend? Don't say husband. Nope. I'm a moving target. Well, I am one hell of a shot. I tell you what. Why don't I keep moving and you work on your aim. Hmm. ? Pleasure is my business ? I wanna make you feel all right... Bet. Do you have a favorite ball player, man? I got one for every sport. We having a conversation or are we playing cards? Is it gonna hurt you to give me an answer? Can't you just give me an answer? Fine. I like Kevin Mawae. Works hard, sacrifices his body, plays hurt. - You gonna call or what? - Nah, but I'm gonna raise. Ten dollars. Mine's Killebrew, by the way. Harmon Killebrew. OK. I re-raise. Call that. Know why I like Harmon so much? 'Cause he was fatter than crap. He could get his bat around quicker than a chili-cheese breakfast. I bet. Call. Check. Bet. I'm in! Fine. Your lame-ass set of threes is good. Always play three. Harmon used to wear number three, you know. Déjà vu all over again. Aren't you supposed to be...? - Wyoming. - Yeah. Yeah. - So you know? - Yeah, I heard. It's why I'm back. You know he didn't jump, right? - He would never do that. - We all know that. What did he used to say? He wanted to live long enough to see his enemies in the ground. Yeah, he called the obituaries the sports page. I got a guy who can help us. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I think so. Look, I'm having a really good night. The kind of night I need to be having right about now. Please, just hear him out. Come on, just hear him out. - Him? - I made him promise not to tell. I knew you wouldn't come. Come on, Eddie, you're here. Let him break it down for you. Everest is a cautious man. He's a careful man. He has a permanent home-field advantage. And he's beyond my reach. I can't even walk into his casino. What's keeping you out? Something tells me you know exactly what's keeping me out. So you cheated a cheater. Where's the proof? Video. That's all of it. No copies. I'm only gonna ask one thing in return. Help me break him. I feel lucky just to be alive right now. Tell you what. I'll think about it. Give me the answer I want and the tape's yours. - Clark Marcellin. - Hey. What's up? We need to meet up. The old Sunset Lounge, all right? Look, man, I already told you that I want out. - Got a guy about to buy big on Wiltronics. - Call him back. OK. All right, sir. I'll call you back. - OK. - Want to know what I have here? This company we use for background checks, bunch of ex-Feds, very thorough. You can't think you need a degree to do this job. What, do I? Hell no. Problem is, that's very much beside the point, and the point is, I don't make the rules, and there are rules. - What burns me is that you flat-out lied. - Look, I do have my Series 7. I don't even want to know how you managed to get that without a degree. You can let me go because I was too bored to finish college and replace me with some smart-ass with a paper who couldn't convince a burning man to jump into a lake, but you see the numbers that I put up. I've run this office for nine years, I've never seen anyone come out of the gate like you. If I was straight up with you, you would have never hired me. Those two missing years on your résumé? Please tell me they were not spent locked up somewhere. - No. I was playing cards. - Make a living at it? - Most of the time. - Any other surprises? You're the one that has the thorough background people. Yeah. We keep this between us. But anything else and you're gone. Now go and make us some more money. Where's that ten grand we're cutting up? - It's gone. - It's just... just gone? It's just gone. What, gone like... like... like our shot at the Matador gone? Gone like every damn penny I have to my name? He saw us coming. - OK, what next? - We cannot just walk away from this. I haven't slept a night through since this whole thing's happened. Yeah, well, I can't get a decent game, so... - I'm done following your lead. - Fine. Go ahead. Make your own decision. But if I walk away from this, I spend my whole life living it down. I question every other thing I do. And by the way, my friends, so do both of you. Well, Everest got the game wired, he got the place wired, he got the whole damn city of Vegas wired, man! Sometimes, you just... you take a beating and you walk on. It's called life. You know, this isn't just about cards. It's bigger than that. - Maybe that's it, then. - What is? We can't beat him at this game, let's change the game. Right, right. We challenge him to Parcheesi, lure him into a high-stakes bingo parlor or something. - I think I can get us back into the Colorado. - What? Man, we step foot in the Colorado, they will wrap our asses in a pretty little bow. That's the best-case scenario. Not without the videotape of us working together, they can't. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You've got that look on your face. You know, that "I got lousy news for Don" look. The footage of you and those three kids is gone. - Well, how the heck did that happen? - I don't know. You know, Luke is Lowball's boy. Maybe he had a pang of conscience. Probably no point in looking for him, right? No, probably not, but maybe I will anyway. Eddie. Um... he isn't here. - Do you wanna wait? - All right. - Do you want drink? - No, thanks. You know, I feel like I spend half my life waiting for him? Only half? Hmm. Hmm. God, you are just one big old knot, huh? - He doesn't have that effect on you? - No. Your father tends to lose focus when he gets around a casino. He ignores you, huh? Maybe it's an age thing. I don't know. I never dated a guy who... - You know? - Old enough to be your father. Hey. He treats you like dirt. So, why don't we be bad little kids and have some fun, hmm? And it'd feel really good. Man, you two must be perfect together. Prodigal son. Son? Maybe it's time we try to relate as adults. It's never your fault, is it? Sometimes it is. - I'm man enough to admit it. - Really? Well, you hit Mom up for ten grand, which would be her problem, except that ten grand was mine. - Your ten grand? - What a sport. She owed that money to me. Where she got it is none of my business. - Owed it to you. - That's right. I have very little time for this. Here's what we'll do. We'll split the country in half. You take everything east of the Mississippi. How's that sound? - I ever tell you about your grandfather? - So what? He left you, you left me? Is that it? History repeats itself? I remember sitting on the floor in the dark one winter. They'd repossessed the furniture, shut off the lights, eviction notices were piling up. Your grandmother sat there on the floor just staring at the wall. At this point, she's way past tears. The old man walks in, takes in the scene, he was half in the bag. You know what he said to us? He said, "Don't worry. I will never leave youse. " "I will never leave you," like he's doing us a favor. - My mother never wailed so loud. - Now you're about to make me cry. See, that was the problem, Eddie. He stayed. There wasn't a day that went by that I didn't pray this guy would disappear. What is this? The "facts of life" speech I missed out on when you were too busy being a chickenshit? You can't escape your blood, kid. Hey. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Like I said, you're young yet. But you know, I look at you and you know what I see? I see me. I see me in a quarter-century-old snapshot. Except I wore better clothes. What's the line from that movie? "It's in the genes, Charlie. " "The horse got absolutely nothing to do with it. " You'll learn the hard way. We all learn the hard way. What's he gonna learn from you, Jimmy? You stay the hell away from Mom! Remember when we laid out those ground rules? No threesomes, except on your birthday? Well, happy birthday. - It's not my birthday. - Well, tonight it is. Previously on the 4400... A comet cannot change course. - This one has. - Then it's not a comet. We're not sure what's just happened. There appears to be something out there. The light is gone, and thousands of people have just suddenly appeared. Diana Skouris. Tom Baldwin. You two will be one of the teams that's responsible for investigating what happened to the returnees. We're letting them go. We're letting them go ? We don't have a legal right to hold them. Why disappear a little girl from the 1940s, hold her for 60 years, and then send her back with the ability to predict the future ? - Can i go home ? - Home ? With you. I don't like being here alone. Shawn Farrell... Uncle Tommy. Hi. He's all yours. Hey, what about Kyle ? Kyle's in a coma, Shawn. What the hell did you do to Kyle ? I don't know what happened. I put my hands on him. That's it. He woke up. You're talking about some kind of ripple effect. Diana Skouris to the head of the class. The incidents themselves are just catalysts for change. I swear to god. I'll ask you one more time... Where's my son ? - Kyle ! Kyle ! - No ! Tom, don't ! You're not my son. Who are you ? What are you ? I'm human. I come from a different time. Your future. In my time, humanity is dying out. Only those we took can prevent the catastrophe from happening. That's why they've been altered and seeded back into the timeline. You mean it's all going to end ? - You have to help them. - Help them ? How ? Dad ? Kyle... I intend to provide a safe haven for any 4400 in this country who needs one. You goddamn freak ! Danny, stop it ! Stop blaming me for nikki ! I guess what i'm asking is if i could stay here for awhile. Tell me a little more about this...ability of yours. I wasn't pregnant when i was abducted, but i was when i got back. That baby could be the key to the future, and it has to be protected, and i can do that. Go ahead ! Run ! I will find you. That baby belongs with me. Isabelle... Isabelle... What is it, baby ? Bad dream ? Same one. She's fine, richard. We're all fine. Come back to bed. It's probably just a raccoon... Who was it ? They took off before i could ask. They left something behind. Someone tracked us down. Who ? NTAC ? Collier ? This look like their calling card to you ? I don't know who it is, but someone knows we're 4400s. Start packing. I'll drive into town tomorrow morning to pick up my last paycheck, and then we're out of here. Can't we just go now ? We're gonna need that money, Lily. Mr. and Mrs. Sumlin. Peter. If you'll follow me. Forgive our appearance. As you know, the Center doesn't officially open until tomorrow. Peter doesn't have time to wait. That's where you're wrong, Mrs. Sumlin. Peter has all the time in the world. Hi, peter. My name is Jordan Collier. Just this way. Our medical lab isn't quite ready, so we thought Peter would be more comfortable up here. Hello, Peter. I'm Shawn. What do you say we get started ? Yeah ? Okay, buddy. I want you to take my hands. Try to relax. Okay ? You're okay. You're doing good. You're doing so good. It's okay. Oh, my god. Is he okay ? He's fine. Just watch. It's okay. You're okay. You're okay. Peter ? How do you feel, honey ? Son ? Thank you for your generous donation. We tried everything. Radiation, bone marrow transplants... Is he really cured ? Take him back to his doctor. Run some tests. Peter's leukemia is gone. This is a miracle. For now, it has to remain a private miracle. May i remind you that the confidentiality agreement you've signed is strictly binding. But people should know about that young man. And they will. In time, they'll know everything. Very nice. Floating the five. Floating the five. - You nervous ? - Aren't you ? No, not at all. Well, maybe a little bit. Okay. A lot. Now, you really want to do this, right ? Right. Let's go. Okay. Says here she registered an ability under the dinstman-lenhoff bill. Some kind of precognitive insight ? Yes, her visions stopped about four months ago. We're not sure why. Oh, too bad. I was going to ask if Teledex will hit its quarterly projection. Well, we'd like to get started, if that's all right. Certainly. If you'll just sign where indicated. Diana Skouris, Your adoption of maia rutledge is hereby complete, Legal, and binding. So witnessed by me, Henry Biederman, 10th circuit family court of Seattle. You know, some of us have to look far and wide to find the people we'll call "family." You two had to look clear across time. Diana, let me introduce you t o your daughter Maia. Maia, say hello to mommy. I'm not doing it. I mean it this time. No way. It's just a cat scan, Kyle. You've had them before. This one's gonna tell them the same thing the last 150 told them... nothing. There's nobody in here but me. I know that, and sooner or later, they're going to stop looking. When ? When ? looking for her in Punjab! I'll have to come here again. First, I have to make grandpa meet her. Then I have to marry her, produce kids. After that... Listen to me, you fool! First find a way to produce money. After that, you may produce kids. C'mon, we have to go to Australia! The luggage should've been here a day ago. How did it get misplaced? You fool! You should've let the wallet and Lakhan's address remain in my bag! What are we going to do now? All day, all night, all you do is complain! - 'All I do is complain! ' The luggage will be traced. They've asked us to come in the evening. We have to find Lakhan. Follow me! I am Happy! - Good for you. My name is Happy Singh, a friend of King. King! He is not happy! Rangeela, see how I managed to hitch a ride! Of what use are the cops if they don't know the whereabouts of the criminals? Don't mess with the white cops! They'll throw you into the sea! Am I their father's property? What a big house! It's not a house, but a mansion! That's Raftaar! - Raftaar! Look, he's bowing to welcome us! Bless you, dear! I'm not asking for charity. Just tell me the price of your casino. It's my bread and butter, King. Yes, everyone needs bread and butter. But only when they're alive. King, Happy has come from the village. He's accompanied by Rangeela. Happy! Where are you, my friend? Who's that hiding his face? He's Sheru's brother, Pankaj Singh! Hey, Happy! Dilbaug! Look, how he's bowing with respect. 'Lt's commonplace to hear on every street that brother Lakhan is a thief! ' 'Lt's commonplace to hear on every street that brother Lakhan is a thief! ' Have you forgotten how you stole pencils as a kid? Today, you're a big gangster! Hello, sister-in-law! Should I salute you or hug you? Happy, what are you up to? Happy, come here. Have you come alone? No, brother Rangeela has come along. Touch his feet. - Never mind. Greetings, brother Lucky! Greetings, sister-in-law! He's also addressing me as sister-in-law? ! How did a romantic track begin in an action film? Happy and Rangeela! What are they doing here? Remember how your parents raised you... The time has come for you to become their strength. You've started to speak well. That's because I speak the truth. Hence, people endear to it. Now c'mon, come back to the village. I can't. How can you do such criminal deeds being a Sikh? People swear by our community's trust and honesty! C'mon, don't create a fuss! Happy! Have you forgotten what our guru taught us? He'd named our community 'Khalsa.' 'Khalsa' means pure. You should become true 'Khalsa.' - Happy! Shun dishonesty and quietly return to the village with me. Strive to become a true 'Sikh.' Happy! - Hey! Well done! Only this was left to see now. Now you're a threatening a fellow villager! Mika, they're standing to your right. Happy! What's wrong with your brother? Who are you aiming the gun at? I removed the gun out of respect towards my brother. But these two belong to our village. How can I possibly pull the gun at them? He's a saint, despite being a sinner! Rangeela! - Yes, brother. Go back to your country with your friend in the next flight. C'mon! Make sure I don't have to tell you again. I understood the first time. What did you understand? I used to carry you around on my shoulders! And now, you're throwing me out? Thank your stars I'm only pushing you or I would've shot you by now! You'll regret it! You will rot in hell. Don't you have any manners? Is this how you behave with guests? Rogues! It took us 3 days to get to Lucky but he threw us out in less than 3 minutes! He won't come back. So, let's return. With defeat written all over my face? I'd promised in front of everyone that I'll return only with Lucky. I'm not going anywhere. Look, we had lied to you about the asthma attack being a heart attack to get rid of you. What about Lucky's parents? Were their tears false as well? They must've reached the airport even before our flight took off awaiting their son to come back home. I won't return without him! Anyway, you're about to get married. Go ahead, become a groom! But I want you to be there, you fool! If Prito has to become mine she'll have to wait. I can't leave you alone. C'mon, let's go to the airport and fetch the luggage. Forget the airport! I can't walk anymore. Let's fetch the luggage. Our underwear's are three days' old. Never mind. Old is gold. I'm fine. You're stinking, you fool! Listen. My dear fellow, stay put. Because even if you don't get lost in this foreign land I surely will. Hey you Englishman! Your people said in the morning to come in the evening. Now its evening, but my luggage is still missing. Why trouble a poor man? Sir, this is a counter for ticket booking. Go there if your luggage is missing. Oh no! I'll have to speak in English once again! What's wrong with him? Hey! Who's it? Hello! What are you doing here? I've been observing you from my shop all day. What are your intentions? My shop has a security siren as well as a camera installed. Try anything, and the cops will catch you immediately! Hey cop woman! What cops are you talking about? Who do you think I am? You look like a thief to me. I... I'm not a thief! Why are you laughing? When a poor man is hungry, he looks like a thief. I've lost my baggage at the airport. I was kicked out of the house I was supposed to visit. I'm hungry and have caught a cold since morning. I'm not a thief. I only look like one. Sorry. It's just that I'm all alone. My shop neither has a security siren nor a camera. So, you lied to me. Hence, I panicked. These forsaken agents put you on the flight. And you readily come here to starve yourselves! Lousy losers! Shut up! Rose! - Hi! I'll have another one of your special roses! It's the only place in the world I pay 100 dollars for a rose! Thank you. It's lucky for you. Yes, it is. Stop eating grass! Come here, I'll give you food. No, my friend's going to meet me here. My house is right here. If your friend comes back, you'll be able to see him. C'mon! If you remain hungry, you'll look like a thief cum gangster! Oh... no! Careful, you nut! His hair is like a dog's! How on earth will he see? Who did that to me? - I'm feeling very odd to eat at a complete strangers house! You were distressed, while I was panicking! There, we know each other now. You are poor, so am I. Now, we have something in common as well! Which village are you from? I'm from the actor Dharmendra's village. From Sanewaal? Yes. - Then we're neighbours! I heard father had a heart attack. When did you hear? - What? From whom did you hear? Guru told me. Lucky, you were father's favourite. You must return to the village. I'll look after the affairs of this place. Don't worry. Mika, who doesn't want to return to the village? I still remember how father used to hold my finger and take me for a walk into the fields. But with the number of bad deeds to my name even if I do double the number of good deeds I can never return to the village. Seeing Happy over here, has brought back memories of my village and family. I've heard that the cops of 11 nations are out to get King. Not King, they're out to get Don! Don! But there are 11 such dons who are out to get King! And you've come to take these notorious people back? ! It's not the people who're notorious it's their deeds. If we separate these two the same people can become good like us. You're very interesting. That's because I speak the truth. Hence, people endear to it. Want to hear another truth? I've never seen my mother. But after meeting you I feel that she must've been just like you. He's disappeared again! Happy! Where have you disappeared, you fool? Happy! - Hey you, shouting there! Do you want me to call the police? No! No police please! Get off from here! Get off! The old man's asked me not to scream! How do I find him now? Happy! Dear! What happened? What happened? - You come here. You idiot! - Why are you chasing me? What happened? - I had to sleep all night on this wooden bench. My bottom's become sore! But, I didn't tell you to sleep on this. Where were you all night? I was in that house waiting for you. Couldn't you see me waiting for you? How am I... Here comes a customer! Here comes a customer! One minute. Ma'am, this bouquet costs 10 dollars. - Yes, there you go. Thank you. Whose shop did you take over overnight? That... - Happy! - One minute! Son! - Yes? - I wanted to know... Who is this idiot? Hey! - She's the owner. This is my friend, Rangeela! Friend, friend. Friend? ! Looks more like your friend's father! Old lady, watch your tongue! Whom did you call an old lady? ! Where were you all night? Poor fellow was so worried! Did you settle base at the airport? This is a classic case of thief accusing the cop! Back there, the 'missing luggage' counter itself was missing! On top of that, I'd have to explain it to them in English! I... manage. - Manage. To hell with your manage. Had you really gone to the airport or someplace else? No, he... - She's very suspicious. No, she's not. She's very good at heart. She just makes a mountain that's all. Happy! - You take rest. - Yes? Dear, this is a yacht. You have to decorate it with flowers. - Ok. I've written the address behind. Okay? - Okay. Come, Mr. Rangeela. - Get lost! I didn't sleep last night, didn't eat and now you ask me to come along with you! We've to go to the airport again in 2 hours. Our trains are better than their flights! At least, it's mentioned that the passengers solely are responsible for their luggage. Right? - Right. But Rangeela is too grumpy for your age. Your blood pressure may rise. I've prepared lunch at home. Go, eat and rest for a while. See that house with the window? That's mine. Yes, I can see it. - Take the keys. Yes. Go. Don't go to a wrong house. We won't. Thank you. Happy! - Yes? - Yes? People say that whosoever I pray for God showers His blessings upon him. Yes. Take this. Today, you'll succeed at everything you do. Go, dear. May God be with you. I'm bound to succeed now that I look like Pandit Nehru. Good luck. Everything looks fine on the outside but what do I do about the mess I created inside? Oh Lord Waheguru, help me. Hurry up, Udaas! - Okay, just relax. Welcome! Mika! Mika! Actually, I've bought a yacht for the first time. Whether it's your first love or your first boat it's the same feeling. Oh! I love you! I love you! I'd once bought a boat in the village. I went fishing with my uncle in it. A crocodile got hooked on to the bait and swallowed my uncle. Ever since, mother has not cooked fish in the house. In the entire village... - Enough Udaas! Enough Why didn't the crocodile swallow you instead? Who's it? Hands up! It's me, Happy! Not again! This idiot's come back! What do we do with him? You've still not gone back? ! He won't go so easily. King, you don't know him. He sticks like a chewing gum! What do you mean? Enough! Happy, this is not Punjab. Over here, people do as I say. That's what I'm telling you, this is not Punjab! Let's all return to the village. I'm begging you! I've met your parents. I've seen the tears in their eyes. They have expectations from you, ever thought about that? It's their wish to see you married to see you become a groom, you idiot! Friends and relatives dancing at your wedding... The entire village rejoicing, fireworks in the sky... Hey! Why are you bursting them now? Who's that? Who's it? Where's it? Why is this happening? Lucky! - Uncle, c'mon! Don't panic! It's me! Oh no! Who is this man? I've been swimming for so long! Why am I not reaching the shore? Am I swimming in the wrong direction? What's wrong with King? What happened to Lucky? They've extracted the bullet but he has a serious head injury. Thank God for his turban, or he wouldn't have been alive. But he's contracted a strange disease due to his injuries. What's it called, Hema... - Haemoplasia. Yes, Hema. Yes, Hema. - What? Semi-paralysis. The one from Parel. From Parel? What's that? In this disease, one can see everything, hear everything but can't speak or move. In the movie 'Anjaam', Shahrukh Khan had this disease. I've watched all of Shahrukh Khan's films. But which one was 'Anjaam'? Wasn't it the one with Chandrachur and Sanjay Dutt in it? How the hell did Chandrachur come into the picture? All you movie buffs... Shahrukh never acted in 'movie buff! ' Have you gone mad? Shut up, you idiots! This is not a cinema hall! I can't figure out how he got a head injury despite me being so cautious in carrying him. 'You buffoon! ' 'You were bashing the goons with me strung around your neck and you're surprised at my head injuries? ' Look! King's blood is boiling! The point is who'll shoulder the responsibility of such a huge business vampire? Who'll ascend the King's throne? Tell me... - 'Who's King's elder brother? Happy? ! As King? ! - 'No! Kill that idiot! ' 'Kill Happy! ' How can I become King? - I can never become King. Happy? - Happy? Of course, I'm happy! But King's pointing towards Happy. Don't point at me! It's bad manners to point at someone. He's pointing at the right person. Happy has saved King's life! 'No, he's not! ' He's right. If it wasn't for Happy King wouldn't have been alive today. 'Shut up, you sad sack! ' I... can't become King. King's blood is boiling even more! Look! Guru! - Of course, his blood will boil! After all, our blood is same to same! Nonsense person! His elder brother should be King. Guru. - Don't make his blood boil. Lucky, we've understood what you want. 'Bravo, Guru! ' You want Happy to take, right? 'Have you gone senile? ' - No, I can't become King. Until Lucky recovers, happy will be our king. Okay? - Yes, that's okay. How can I become King, Lucky? 'You fool! ' Even America must've not progressed as fast! - Hear me... Had you gone to fetch King or become King yourself? Listen to me! - What do I listen to? - Listen to me. Lakhan is lying in the hospital. If I take him home in this condition his father will get a heart-attack. - Get lost. I'm a follower of Guru Govind Singh. He's my King. Oh shut up! - God helps those who do good deeds. Are you saying that all Kings are bad people? Until he recovers what's the harm in taking a glimpse into his world? Fine, do what you want. I'm not interested in seeing his world. You're on your own now. Guards! Catch! - Go, catch! He's inviting nothing but trouble! You better put your fist up, right now! One for the treble, two for the base. King is in the place, you better watch this space. One for the treble, two for the base. King is in the place, you better watch this space. 13 cards of the same colour, they contain but one King. We're the ace, as well as the base... We are also daring! Right now! 13 cards of the same colour, they contain but one King. We're the ace, as well as the base... We're also daring! We do as we please. We're not scared to cross boundaries. If your intentions are true, God does the setting. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. You know we bring the rockers in the place. Don't be messing with me, punk, because I hit you in the face. You know, you better salute to the King. You know, you better bow down to the Singh! Go for it, because we are the greatest. We're fearless, we are the bravest! Sing and dance, bad as hell! Punjabis in the house, you better watch yourself. Not once, not twice take over the world 10 times! And if you can still win someone's heart there's nothing like it! If after listening to the machine gun rattle you can still appreciate a cuckoo's chirp there's nothing like it! Come on, sing a song that touches the heart. Sing and dance, from morning to evening! Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Yes, you better pump it up! Singh is in the house. You better turn it up! When I say Singh, you say King! Singh is King. Singh is King. When I say Singh, you say King! Singh is King. Singh is King. We neither had pride nor plume. We were living like paupers. When suddenly, our fortunes changed overnight. I neither owned anything yesterday nor do I own anything today. I only had my heart as mine. Now, I've lost that as well. What's life without love? What's life without high thinking? Singh is King! Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. 13 cards of the same colour. They contain but one King. We're the ace, as well as the base... We do as we please. We're not scared to cross boundaries. If your intentions are true, God does the setting. Singh is King! Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Singh is King. Yes! - What happened? Did you find anything? Her house is locked even today. They say she's not opened her shop in 2-3 days now. And her neighbour said that she's sick. She cries all day and roams like a vagabond. I don't know what's wrong. We'll have to find her. What happened? Happy, what's wrong with you? Why have you become Aladdin? Not Aladdin, I've become King! King? ! You're not even a Singh! Singh's don't chop their hair, they'd rather chop their heads off. And you. I admit I've made a grave mistake. I'll adopt a Sikh's appearance, soon as I return to my village. I'm doing all this because... I'll tell you my story later. First tell me, what's wrong with you? Why are you so sad? Nothing's wrong. Sit down. If anybody cries, I too feel like crying. You'd fed a complete stranger in a foreign land. I can never forget that. I can lay down my life for you. I can do anything for you! Please tell me, tell me. I won't rest until, you tell me. Oh! Shut up! Hey! She's my mother, don't shoot her! Put your guns back in. My daughter's coming back tomorrow after three years. So? So That's good news, isn't it? No way! She thinks that we're still rich. Rich? ! We were once amongst the richest families here when suddenly, my husband passed away. Fool! Left me in knee deep debt. I lost everything Happy. But I always hid this fact from my daughter. If she came to know, she'd leave her studies and come here. But do you know something? I never deprived her of anything. Fulfilled all her needs in the past three years. Yes. Just that I didn't let her come home. But now she's coming tomorrow with the man she loves. I've heard he's from a very rich family. How will I ever face them? I'll be exposed when she discovers that her mom sells flowers by the roadside? How will I accommodate them in such a small house? I'm really tense! He'll never accept her! Her life will be ruined, Happy! That florist will become this mansion's owner... Yes, bring it. - Are we her servants? ! Careful! Come upstairs... - I'd become a servant once. Served the guests with phenyl in place of buttermilk. All the 25 guests died of diarrhea. My master was hanged, while I lost my job. That day... - Enough! Stop it! Please... You seem to have verbal diarrhea! Come on. Brothers, the old King crowned me the new King. Now, it's my job to appoint a King amongst you all. What do you say? What do we have to do? - What? Should I tell him about the scheme, or you too want to hear? No, tell us! Yes, let's hear. What's the harm in hearing it once? Yes... Come closer. It's very simple. You all have to do as you've been doing. Just like Guru clears the crime scene of the evidences he'll have to clear the garden. - What? ! Will Guru become a gardener? And you'll become a driver! Am I supposed to chop vegetables with this? That's a good idea! He's very smart. Let him be the cook. And you better stay far from the house! - Why? - We can't trust you. You may kill us by mixing phenyl with buttermilk! Place him outside as a security guard. - Perfect! Hey! - Don't fuss! What role am I playing? What do we do about this wannabe actress? Since I used to be King's personal secretary should I become ma'am Rose's now? Yes, that'll be fine. What do we do about Mika? He's blind and deaf, cleaning the gun's barrel. I bet he's listening to our conversation from there. I've never seen him work. What role do we assign him? Whoever said he doesn't work. Look. He stares at me all the time! He's risked his life several times to save our King. Great! Make him the bodyguard. Just tell me. What role will you play? Since I'm managing everyone, let me be the manager. - Here. Fine, then I'll be your assistant. Good clothes go a long way in making man presentable. Also, a woman! Servants, you're about to do a great deed today. You're supposed to serve. Okay? Hide all your weapons. They shouldn't be seen. Get it. There, the plane has arrived! Shut up, you fool! Everybody can see that! My daughter's here. Mom! - Sonia! I missed you so much! Let me look at you. Mom, this is Puneet. - Hello aunt! Hello! - This is for you. Thank you. - My pleasure. - Thank you. Happy! Oh my God! Happy! What are you doing here? Just like that. - What a surprise! You look different and nice! Puneet! This is Happy. I'd told you remember? Yes, of course! Hello Happy! - Greeting. This is Puneet, my boy friend! Hi! - Hi. I'm really scared, Julie! There's no such scene. Had I gotten your, Sonia's and my roles I would've done them in a single take. Watch out! - You're a good actress. But the criminals of which this house is full of are hardly actors! I'm scared, we'll be unmasked. Cheers! Look in front! Start acting! Hey, behave yourself! - Sorry! You're supposed to look respectable, not like a goon. Close your buttons. - Sorry! Julie, please don't leave me and go. - Let's go ma'am! She's a knock-out! You're the epitome of sacrifice. Don't try to hide your feelings by plastering a smile on your face. Go and propose to Sonia... Sonia is not the sorts to cheat on her partner. If I propose to her I'll ruin my chances of friendship as well! And then, I have to fulfill the promise I made to ma'am. I'll shoot you! You'll shoot me? ! You fool! What's going on at my party? Please concentrate on your character. What's happening at my party? Oh no! They're fighting again! I see such weapons everyday, you idiot! Have you gone mad? There's a party going on over here. I'll give you one tight slap! Am I your dad's servant? Then am I your dad's servant? You're all servants over here! Who all are carrying guns in an elite party such as this? Who else but these fools carry guns in a party like this! That's true. Don't shoot! Brother Mika! - Yes? Wrong number. You idiots! Have you come to a party or to deal in weapons? Lay down your guns. Not there in your safe deposit. Over here! Not there! Mika, what's that in your sleeve? The other sleeve as well. - You give your gun. From the waistband as well. Remove everything! Give here. He has a good collection of guns! Better safe than sorry. Go to hell! They've ruined my party Happy! Happy! - What happened? Happy! Sonia! Puneet! Puneet! Sonia! Hey! Cover the artillery! Hurry up! Fast! Fast! That's it. You've decked up the table. That's it. Please, come. You're welcome in a 'no entry' zone. - Hi, how are you? Aunt, you've thrown such a big party to welcome us. - Thank you! Thank you so much. The pleasure is mine, dear. Really! So many people... I mean, I was really surprised. There's something here... - Flowers! You forgot to mention thorns! Wow! The diamond studded in your turban looks magnificent! You look more like a king than a manager! Mr. Happy, Sonia was telling how much you spoilt her in just one day! It's because you weren't there. Well, actually I would've been there. But my boarding pass got exchanged with an idiot at the Delhi airport. 'Can't you see and walk? ' - 'Stupid villagers! ' Hey. People are such fools, I tell you! There's something... - Flowers! It's an arrangement of wild flowers, dear. Ma'am, may I take Sir Puneet to meet the other guests? - Sure! Hey! So do you. Use your guns as much as you want after 2-4 days. Just wait till my daughter gets married. Please try and be calm until then. You lech at her so much so that even the mirror has developed cracks! Hi! - That's Rachel. - Hi! Nice to meet you. - So, you're having fun? - Yes. Great party, isn't it? - Enjoy yourselves! Enough now. Ladies and gentlemen! Everybody... Guys. Sonia, can you come and join me? What is it, Puneet? Guys, I'd come here essentially to meet Sonia's mother. But now I'm thinking of leaving only after getting married to Sonia. Sonia, will you marry me? I don't believe that you'll... Will you marry me? When? - Yes! I can't see my friend so upset. Get me a whisky! - Get you Lucky? ! Now, is he planning to put him on display? What are you muttering? I'll get you one. - What? ! Idiot! Lucky! So, you're sitting here comfortably! That idiot has become King and is treating us like servants! Sorry! Where are you? C'mon! Who put this table in the centre? Not me, . - This... - Who is this, mom? He's our real King! - The real king? ! Yes, he's the king amongst kings! Everything belongs to him, dear. What? ! - She means that it's all because of his blessings. He's a saint. He's Saint Divine Finger! - Everybody seek his blessings. Hail Saint Divine Finger! Bless me, priest. But who's he pointing at? His finger... Watch carefully. Watch carefully. He's pointing upwards. It indicates that God is above all. He's observing a vow of silence since many years. Ma'am doesn't do a thing without his permission. Aunty, then why don't we ask the divine saint to fix the wedding date? Will he tell us? Yes! And he's already told us! Look, it is third. The third of next month! It's confirmed! Oh God! Only 13 days left! There are so many preparations to be done. Manager! - We'll manage. We need to talk to you. I'll be back! - Come on, move! - Ask him. What nonsense is this! - Yes. We'd spoken about 3 days! You don't expect us to be servants for 13 days! Are you mad? - Shut up! Ramlal! Stage actors! How was I supposed to know that the villain had come to marry the heroine? Why don't you ask him about the future as well? All you know, he'll tell us the dates of their baby's delivery! And we'll be reduced to baby-sitters! - You idiot. Sonia, do you know I jog every morning at 7? Swim at 8, do yoga by 9 and have breakfast at 10. Keep it here. - These idiots are late by 2 hours! Madam. - Look, the breakfast's ready. What are you looking at? Lay the table! Sir Puneet is very jovial in the mornings. Good morning! - Thank you! - Good morning! He looks so much like my dad! Say that you love me... - Amazing! Say that you love me... - Of course! What's this? Bread stuffed with potatoes? Also, bread stuffed with radish and egg-plant? ! Son, there's plain bread as well. Hey you! Just because your face looks stuffed doesn't mean you'll prepare only stuffed bread? Happy! Knife! - Knife? ! Relax, its okay. Knife! - Happy! - Here it is. Happy, knife... - Knife. - Here, take his knife. Dear, I need to spread the butter on the bread. Such a big knife to spread butter? Big people live life king-size! Here's your cold-drink. - Give it to me. Hey Devdas! - Udaas! My name is Pankaj Udaas. I don't care what your name is. What are you doing here leaving a guard's duty? Have you asked Chunnilal to take over? Please sit. Sit down! It was only a glass. Of course! Practice! Aunty, sack this senior citizen right away! - Madam! Had he been working in a government's office he would've retired thrice by now. He's doomed! Aren't you the gardener? We got late today. So, we're helping each other out. Manage with stuffed bread. It's Punjab's national breakfast. From tomorrow, we'll serve you an English breakfast. Milk with wafers! - Corn flakes! - Yes, that's what. You can make scrambled eggs as well, right? You don't bother about it. Wow! It's beautiful! - Wow! I'm impressed! This is absolutely amazing! I can't believe mom owns this five star hotel! God knows what all she's keeping from me! There's a casino as well! Sonia, let's go! - I don't know how to gamble. Neither do I! Come! Mika, can't you see? I'd won a gold medal last week in rifle shooting. The target was 500 kilometers away. I don't carry the medal around or I would've showed you. The Olympics wasn't last week. Go to the casino and tell the owner that our two guests who've gone inside should win in all the games, understood? The casino is this way. Yes! Puneet, you'd told me that you don't know how to play. Actually, I'm an expert. But I don't like to praise myself. All the casino owners of Las Vegas were begging me not to come and play in their casinos. Puneet, you're simply great! Sonia, let's go party! Doesn't your mom own a disco? She does! How do you know? Really? He's drunk, he's drunk... Look, my friend's drunk! He's falling here, he's falling there. Look, he's falling everywhere! He's drunk, he's drunk... Look, my friend's drunk! He's falling here, he's falling there. Look, he's falling everywhere! Pal, open the bottle and give me a sip. Pal, mix some soda and make me a 'Patiala peg. We're full of life and zest. So get me all the rum you can, for the sake of friendship. C'mon, let's all drink to friendship! He's drunk, he's drunk... Look, my friend's drunk! He's falling here, he's falling there. Look, he's falling everywhere! Hell will break loose if my friend gets drunk. Hell will break loose if my friend gets drunk. Life is so short. So why drink sparingly? Drink to your heart's content. Sorry, sorry, very sorry! I'm intoxicated with alcohol. On top of that, there are beauties galore. We walk with a confident gait. Sorry, sorry, very sorry! Sorry, I'm intoxicated and I'm having a lot of fun. Please forgive me and give me a hug. C'mon, let's all drink to friendship! He's drunk, he's drunk... Look, my friend's drunk! He's falling here, he's falling there. Look, he's falling everywhere! Pal, open the bottle and give me a sip. Pal, mix some soda and make me a 'Patiala peg. We're full of life and zest. So get me all the rum you can, for the sake of friendship. C'mon, let's all drink to friendship! Look my friend's drunk! Look my friend's drunk! He's falling here, he's falling there. He's falling here, he's falling there. Ever since, your photo's been printed in the newspaper he's been staring at it. That's how his health has improved. Even the doctor has said that his health will improve drastically if you're around him. King, come forward. I too am not getting a break as a heroine. Come on, hurry up. Fill it up. You love me so much, friend? Now, I'll constantly be around you. Just wait till you get off this wheel chair. 'The day I get off the chair, I'll make sure you occupy it.' Today's a big day. I'm going to distribute money amongst the poor Australians. I'm proud of you, Rangeela! From now on, distribute money amongst the poor each time there's an improvement in Lucky's health. Absolutely! I can't be miserly today. 'Fools! Throwing away my hard-earned money! ' Lucky, what's wrong? Tell me! Doctor has said that Lucky's tense about his work. What tension? You tell me, I'll solve it for you. There's a hot dog seller's truck parked at Coolangatta. He wanted to get rid of it. Such a measly job! Ever heard of a King towing trucks? Brother, there are two big restaurants in front of the truck. Their business is suffering a lot. The restaurant owners are King's good friends. King had promised them. Then fulfill his promise! Go and get rid of the truck! 'For once, he spoke like a King! ' Do one thing. Don't leave the truck anywhere. Leave it at his place and give him some money as well. 'Fool finally showed his true colours! ' What happened? King needs your blessings. Why are you doing this to me? Where are you taking me? Stop it! Please let me go. Tell your son not to go there ever again to do business. If he puts his van there, we'll kill him. Is there a circus happening here? Go! We are a family of 7 people. One more is to come. What's wrong? Isn't he agreeing? Aren't we? The fool... Udaas, this truck is their source of livelihood. He's asking us what price we can pay for seven people going hungry for the rest of their lives. If you can calculate the exact amount, we'll accept it without even counting it. If we can estimate the cost he'll accept it without counting. Any fool says anything then come to us. Okay? If any problem, call me. You are like God to me. God to me! Gardener, what flower is this? Don't you know this much? Whoever made you a gardener! Now a servant will glare at me? ! Listen to me, you... - Dear! Forgive him. He's your father's age. No, he's my grandfather's age. The candles on his birthday cake must cost more than the cake. Lousy senior citizens! Hey Devdas! Who are you day dreaming about? Watchman, I'm talking to you! I've been watching you day dream about women all day! Why don't you do your duty? Go, do your job. Go! Please? Please! One has to pamper old servants. Why is your mood spoilt? Leave the poor servants alone. The gardener knows nothing about flowers the watchman's day dreaming about girls the front page of the newspaper is always missing including the news channel on T.V. What's going on this house? I can't take it! Listen idiots! Finish all of Lucky's chores. He's not improved a tad since yesterday. 'Lf I move a finger, you all will give me a loss worth millions! ' King had an unfinished job. - What's that? 'May you rot in hell, Julie! ' An officer from Indian navy has seized King's booty. He's a nobody! An honest Indian chap. He had threatened King so we had made plans to kidnap his blind daughter. Kidnap her? Why aren't you kidnapping her? Go! Go! 'He'll surely change his mind now.' One minute. Did you just say that she's blind? - Yes. Blind child. In that case, kidnap her, take her to the hospital and get her treated. There he goes again! What do you mean? Who's our enemy? - Her father. Exactly. Not the girl. We'll get blessings. Look! His finger is moving! - Improvement! He moved his finger. Slowly, he will start moving everything. What a mess I am in. It's a critical case of cortical blindness. But I'm sure, I can make her eyes fine. Fantastic! - Excuse me? He's a good doctor. Foreign education makes a difference. You deposit the fee and I'll take care of the rest. Excuse me, doctor! Listen! I know you, but I'm a little confused. Before my mother died, I'd asked her when I'll be able to see again. She said that she's going to meet God. There she'll request Him to come down to earth to fix my eyes. I asked her if God will have any time for me. She said, why not? And if he's very busy, he'll send his friend instead. Hence, I'm confused whether you are God or his friend. Uncle, tell me, are you God or his friend? This is the Indian market of this country. - Really? It's the best place for wedding shopping. - Happy. Yes, mom! - Sorry! - What happened? No, the wedding date can't be changed as Saint Divine Finger has fixed it. What could I do? It was very slippery. Yes, that's right. Even now I'm with your future daughter-in-law. Hold on for a minute. You all carry on, I'll join you. Come soon. Yes, mom. Dear, your dad's refused to come for the wedding. Tell him that aunt Rose can help him in his business. Tell him to think about that. Really? - Bye. Oh no! - What happened? You're too funny! C'mon Anjali, hurry up! Tanya! - Raftaar! I'm seeing you after 6 years! How've you been? - I'm fine. And you? I'm fine. Driver, where's ma'am Sonia? She must be around, sir. These servants are such brats! All seem to be hanging around girls. I'm glad to see you like this. So, you've finally changed your ways. You left without informing... - What could I say? Mom, let's go! Is she your daughter? - Yes. How old is she? She's 5 years old. I'll get going. Let's go, Anjali. Why did you lie to uncle? I'm 6 years old. Oh Lord. Mom! - Let's go. Father is waiting. Happy! - Yes? How's this? - Your kids will be born after 1 year. Why shop for them now? These are for me! Look, even the mannequins are blushing. Have some shame! Let's try another store. Come, I'll buy you good Indian clothes. If you wear Indian clothes in the wedding... Hey! I'll kill you, you criminal! Let's get out of here, Sonia! Come. Sonia! Happy! What's going on? Who are these people? Happy. Happy, be careful! Hey! - Sonia! Leave me, criminals! Happy! Mom! - Hey! Anjali! - Come, my dear. - Dear. - Mummy. A person like you can never change! - Tanya, listen to me! Let go off my daughter! - Tanya, listen to me! What happened? - Happy! That's my daughter... Who are you talking about? Ever thought of how many kids you've orphaned? Oh Lord. Leave me, I'll kill you! You better watch yourselves. Happy! Happy! Singh is king. Singh is king. Singh is king. Happy! Sonia! - Happy! They want to kill you! Stop you! Happy! Why do they want to kill you? Happy! I'd sent a criminal to jail last week. They're probably here to take revenge. What do we do now? Ever flown a helicopter? No Happy! Do you know how to fly? - Shut up! But I'm sure you know how to swim! C'mon Sonia! - Oh my God! Jump! - Hail Guru Nanak Singh! Are we still alive? - Yes, we are. Are you sure? - Come, Ms Sonia. Slow. Thank you. - Careful. Thank you. We're almost there. - Thank you. Any improvement? Tremendous improvement! Great! Distribute money amongst the poor. They'll bless us. But we have a problem. - What's that? From where do we find poor people? India is full of them. Suitcases filled with money are being dispatched every day. Mom, they're robbing you! Why would anyone rob me? What would they find except flowers? Flowers? ! I mean, flowers should be watered. Or they wither. C'mon, water them! You seem to know a lot about flowers! Of course! She's Phoolan Devi! ('Phool' means flower) C'mon, scoot! Go! It's almost evening. I've been asking you since morning but nobody seems to know anything! Sonia! - Where've you been all morning? Where were you? - I was... Why weren't you taking my calls? Oh! 13 missed calls. It was on silent, that's why... But where were you? You didn't even inform anyone! I'd gone to purchase your wedding cards. Come here. - Careful! I'm wearing new shoes. Why did you have to take Julie along? Because she knew where exactly one would get wedding cards! What's the problem? I think it's a shoe problem. Happy, you're different. She's different. She's not your type. Since I'm a manager, only a typist would qualify as my type. All right, my job was to warn you and so I did. Now, it's up to you and your typist. Why are you smiling? What happened? No, it's not a shoe problem! - You've fallen in love! I'd once fallen in love. I was leaving my girlfriend's house when my wife caught me red-handed. I lost both the women on the same day! Udaas, drink up! Julie, how come we didn't realize that Sonia is in love with Happy? Black. - What? It's because you all are blind and deaf! I've seen the love she feels for Happy in her eyes. Hello Ms. Roppad! - I'm from Patiala! Yes, that's what. You've seen the love in her eyes, now look at her wedding invitation. Why's she marrying that idiot, when she's in love with Happy? She herself doesn't know she loves him. How's that possible? It happens at times, Guru. She gets restless if Happy leaves her for a little while. She feels jealous if he's talking to another girl. If this is not love, then what is it? Foolishness! Mika, empty glass? ! But my heart's filled with grief! I won't drink a single peg until Happy and Sonia are united. But first let's find out whether Happy loves Sonia or not. He's crazy about her! He misses her all day. He had planned his marital and family life the minute he saw her in Egypt! It's because of ma'am Rose, he's getting her married to that idiot. I think my best friend Happy will remain a bachelor for life. Idiots, do something about Happy! Hats off to you, sir! You sleep at 3 a.m. And wake up early to go jogging! Strange! How do you manage it. 3 a. M? You fool! I sleep at 10 every night. What are you saying? Weren't you talking to ma'am Sonia till 3... That wasn't you? Oh! It must be Sir Happy. He doesn't sleep all night and wakes up late in the morning. I guess they were discussing your wedding details. Udaas! - Yes. - Hurry up! Coming! - You may go. Thank you. - Sir, juice for you. Sir, Sonia ma'am is not to be seen. Have you gone crazy? - Why? Why would she be here? Go to Sir Happy, if you want to find her. They are always together. Drink your juice, sir? The names of these flowers are very complicated. I can never remember them. Hence, I've named them myself. Good, let's hear their names. These two flowers with their heads together are Sonia ma'am and Happy sir. Forever blossoming! The withered flower over there is Puneet sir. Remains withered, no matter how much you water it! Mr. Pooh, listen to me. I'll tell you a secret. Please Mika, I can't take it. I don't want to hear a word. Then listen, all the servants are fooling you. They are making dumb-bells of you! They are trying to break you and Sonia up. Don't be fooled by them. Bewares! Have you lost it? Why are you talking to yourself? Talking to myself? ! Well, one prays to God when alone. God! Save my brother Lucky. That depends on his luck. You look after yourself first. He'll be fine soon, you'll see! See? She just added insult to my injury. I got it! Are you hurt? Show me. It's your fault! - No, it's your fault. Wow! Just another of mom's varied businesses! This show is so amazing, don't you think? You enjoy, if you're liking it. I've been noticing since two days that you aren't happy. That's right, Sonia. I'm not Happy. I'm Puneet. But now I think I too should be Happy. Know why? Because Happy is really happy, but Puneet isn't. What are you talking about? You're marrying me but talk to Happy all night! You are always with him. What is this, Sonia? You think there's something going on between Happy and me? Yes, I do. I'm not as rich as you but that doesn't mean I'll tolerate all this. I can't take it! You're so shallow and cheap! You're doubting me? ! Listen, if you're having second thoughts about the wedding let me know beforehand. Enough Puneet! Another word and I'll forget all about my book and commit a crime right here! Puneet, did you manage to catch any fish? Why are you upset? You are a manager, stay in your limits. Don't try to get friendly with me. It's wrong. Not what you did right now, but what you're doing to her. You love her, don't you? Then why can't you see her happy? You can't stand her laughter! What kind of a love is this? I said, shut up! Why are you asking me to shut up? Is it because she laughs with me? Don't people laugh looking at a joker in a circus? I'm a joker in ma'am Sonia's life. Do I seem so intelligent to you, that I can impress a writer? Sonia is one in a million, and she loves you! And that makes you one in a billion! I'm just an illiterate fool! A 'villager' like you say in English. I am everything. I can only make people laugh, not win their hearts. Come with me for a minute. What's wrong with the two of you? You are getting married in two days and are doubting your love for each other? ! Come on, shake hands. Come on. Sonia, get your hand. Very good. Now hug each other. Come on. Very good. Very good. Now that's how it should be! Very good. I've lost my heart to someone. I've found my happiness. I'm dreaming about someone. I've found my happiness. A bond that has touched my heart. It's drawing me towards you. Closer towards you... Closer towards you, God. Closer towards you... Closer towards you, God. Closer towards you... Closer towards you, God. Closer towards you... Closer towards you... The intoxicating ambience... The dark clouds giving way to a whole new world above me. Nature is rejoicing. It's calling out my name. Why is the universe being so kind? God, all I know is that there's no denying my feelings for you. I'm being drawn towards you. Closer towards you... Closer towards you, God. Closer towards you... Closer towards you... Closer towards you, God. Closer towards you... I'm a black belt champion! I'll break your bones if you come near me! Let's dump him in the car and chop him into pieces! No gang has harassed us as much as he has! I'm neither connected to any of the gang groups nor do I mess with the underworld. You're definitely misunderstood. No, we've got the right person. You're definitely mistaken. I'm just a tourist! You aren't a tourist, but a terrorist! You've terrorized the servants! You bit me so hard, you dog! Your voices sound very familiar. Our faces too are very familiar! Look! - You fools! You called me Devdas. - All of you... You idiot! The wedding should take place smoothly. I'll call the priest. Okay. King! - Stop panting! King. - Tell me. Yes, go ahead. - King, the heroes masks from my room are missing. I think Puneet's life is in danger. What? ! - Yes, come along. - I'll explain everything. Bring him out! C'mon step out! Come on, move! - Move! How dare you, you fools! Get home, I'll fire each one of you! Fire us later, let me chop your insides first. You idiots! Is this the time to cut vegetables? This is the first time we've used the knife to cut vegetables. Show him what all we've cut before. Look here. This is the front page of the newspaper. This gardener used to hide it every morning. Devdas! My face looks stuffed to you, doesn't it? And I'm the driver who blocked the news telecast in your room. I'm in trouble. I can't take it! Where are you off to? Today, I'll stuff your insides! Please listen to me, what's your good name? Is it Potato Singh or Stuffed Knife? Please don't mind... - Shut up! Hey! - No! What are you doing? - Happy! No matter how hard one tries, you people won't change. He's getting married to ma'am Sonia tomorrow. If you kill him, who will marry her? You will. You too are in love with her, aren't you? Wonder from where this guy came in between! He didn't come in between, I did. If you want to kill someone, kill me! Rangeela got drunk and spoke nonsense. And you all believed him? ! How could you? Guru, you are sensible. You should've stopped them. Hey! - He escaped, that fool! He'll tell everything to Sonia. What now, King? You've helped my mother a lot. Thank you, Happy. I mean, thank you King. Sonia! I'm just telling the truth. But it sounds bitter this time, doesn't it King? You addressed him correctly this time. He indeed is our King. But do you know why he became King? So that he can keep us criminals from committing more crimes! Yes, so that we come to our senses and think why we're doing what we're doing. Sonia, you believe that the death of criminals would mark the end of crime. But our King believes that only love can conquer hatred. Without firing a single bullet, he's put an end to the evil in us. He didn't become King to enjoy the perks of it. He did it in order to take our real King back to his village. To make him realize his mistakes to show him the correct path and to reunite him with his parents. Sonia, I've spent my entire life In the world of crime. But I've never seen such a King In the entire history of crime. Ma'am, my friend is no King. He's just a Singh, Happy Singh who wants to see everyone happy. And especially me, who he considers his mother. I once happened to give him food when he was hungry. Ever since, he considers all my troubles as his. You fool, no one returns such a huge favour for a slice of bread. He did all this so you could get married. But will I get married now? Will Puneet marry me after knowing the truth? Of course, I will! I would've accepted you even if they had killed me instead of kidnapping me. You being rich or poor makes no difference to me. I love you not for your money. We'll get married tomorrow. Towards you. - Let's go. Towards you. Towards you. Puneet, one minute. All of you please come to my wedding tomorrow. Happy, you too. Sonia, let's go. This boy needs a psychiatrist! He's marrying the girl King is in love with! He'll put our lives in danger too! Mom, dad, you're worried about your lives here my wedding is in danger! - Don't worry, dad. This man standing behind me is taking me to a person who'll get rid of this danger for good. For the past 30 years, this boy has been giving me headaches! 30? But he's only 29. You were carrying him for a year, remember? I can see everything. Everything in this world has a price. Nobody stays here forever. I'm the winning horse. Don't take me to be a loser. I'll be the King, my name is Mika. Mika. Mika. Mika. Mika. Alright, stop! Now, give me your attention. I'm the best, so do as I say. Money is the name of the game. North, south, east or west... The language of money is the same. It's an old story, you better know. If you give one hand, take two in return. Listen up, this is the greatest lesson in the world. All the great people have learnt this lesson. That's me, Mika. Mika! I'd never imagined I'd see you here. I like to surprise people, keep them in the dark. That's Mika for you. I thought that you couldn't see or hear properly. It's not just you. I've convinced many people including my brother and Guru, into believing I'm blind and deaf. What will you gain out of this? - Sympathy. Mind game! - Mika. My only concern is whether you'll be able to kill Happy or not. Happy is my enemy first and then he's yours. I've tried to kill him many times in the past. You love Sonia while I love the King's throne! - Mika. Then see you at the wedding! Mika. - Brother Mika! What a performance! I bet he never suspected that you can't see! You fool! This is my den. I've personally measured every inch of this place. I won't be fit to be called King had I let anyone suspect me here. I can't understand one thing. How were you able to listen to him so clearly? Idiot, I didn't wear this hearing aid to show off! If I don't wear it in my den, then where will I? Now, I'm just waiting for the latest hearing aid and shades that I've ordered from Japan. Once I get them, I'll be able to see and hear everything clearly. Rangeela, don't make my grief an excuse for your drinking. You should've been here with me today. Instead, you're at home getting drunk. It's you and not that idiot who deserves to be the groom! I'm really depressed! If Sonia gets married to that idiot, Happy will be heartbroken. Sardar! - Yes. You've bought everything, but have forgotten the vermillion. He's been given so much responsibility that he's completely caught up. We should help him get the girl in such a way that nobody suspects a thing. Enjoy! - Dilbaug! The groom seems to be very brave. Why do you say that? Only a brave father's son would marry the girl King is in love with. His bravery will soon fizzle out. - Why? Look at King! - Where? Idiot! Why are you looking around? He's right in front of you. I see him now! King's calling his sharp-shooter. Why is it taking so long? Hurry up! Did you see that? I think that the groom's first night will be his last. The night is still far away. I don't think he'll make it even through the day. King is angry! He'll cut him into at least a 100 pieces. I don't have to spend an eternity with her. So, don't take an eternity to recite the mantras. Yes. - Complete the rituals within an hour. Once you start with them, don't stop, come what may. I should've been the one to stop. Had I stopped on time we wouldn't have had a dumb son like you. What's the matter? Sharpshooters have arrived to kill you on your wedding day! Oh my God! What is the 'Chicken Manchurian' gang doing here? And these 'Men in Black'? Something's fishy. We must do something. Listen, think before doing anything. Worry not, Guru! What am I here for? Nice suit! Armani? No, Gucci. - Oh really! I like Gucci. So, are you having fun? - I am. You know, I like men in black. And I like women in white! Bye! - Meet you at night, baby! Happy has made me really unhappy! He must die. Even if you can't kill him, at least bring Sonia to me. I'll marry her someplace else. Good job! - They are at least 15 to 20, right? Yes. - Take this. I'll get some more. Kill everyone if there's even a single gunshot. Turn the wedding into a funeral. And kidnap the bride! But how? Somebody stole all our guns! What? ! Oh no! My sharp-shooters are so sharp! You're getting married today. But you don't look happy. Of course, I'm happy. Despite knowing everything Puneet is still marrying me. All the guests and his parents have arrived. He'll be heart-broken if the wedding doesn't take place. Why won't the wedding take place? God forbid. Why are you talking like this? Yes, Mr. Rangeela. - Hello ma'am! You're drunk, aren't you? You've been telling me for the longest time that you want to say something. Why don't you tell me? Towards you. Happy! Talk to him. God knows what's on his mind. Towards you. Ma'am, he loves your daughter! She hung up? ! Ma'am is just not interested! Lord, help me! What are you waiting for? Throw him down! Sorry, Lucky! Your time's up! Hands up! Now, shoot! I didn't do anything. Mika had sent me to kill you. It's me. - Happy looks so depressed. Oh no! - Who fired! What happened? - Puneet! - Run! Puneet! - Where's my gun? Puneet! What is going on them? I don't know how to explain... They really make me want to destroy them. I get to this point where I'm so irritated and confused that I even forget why I wanted to do such things to them. He looks scary. Not only his face, but he's really a scary person. I could see that. He isn't a bad guy, but he is scary because he acts like he's a good guy. He is also a producer. He's a very diligent guy, and interesting. A little while ago, these two had a chance to work together in another film... Those two in a same film? I didn't even realize it until I saw both of them on the set. Well, they've acted together, so I really didn't think I had to tell them anything. When we started shooting, they suddenly said "Why are you crying?" "I'm not crying" and they went back on acting normally. They were strange. This is the scene... The depth of the blade is nowhere near the depth of the body. There's no way the blade can cut his body in half. I think audiences want to see something impossible. It's not interesting if it's logically possible. People like it when the weak defeat the strong. Besides, before you talk about the depth of the blade you have to think how he keeps that blade in his shoes. Actually, the crew tried to come with the mechanism first. If they don't understand something, they can't stand it. I told them the size of the blade then they asked me where it's hidden. It's impossible. It's a different story if he doesn't have the heel. Some people care about realistic details but I just want to make it happen. So it was brought up. When I met with CG crew the other day we talked about the blade in the shoes. What I had in my head was that there is this thin flexible metal plate on the side of the shoes and something releases and the metal plate pops out. I told them about it, and they were like "Huh." The blade comes out really fast. Actually I like the fact that it comes out so fast that you can't see it. The art director asked me about the mechanism. When we asked this costume place, Jap Koubou to make Ichi's costume and shoes the first thing they asked me was about the blade. They needed to know, so they could design and pick the material for it. But I couldn't give them an answer. I didn't want to reveal the mystery of a hero. It's a mystery how the blade comes out, but it just does. It's a mystery how the blade comes out, but it just does. I wanted to keep it that way. We could've probably come up with some logical explanation, just for the film. ...but I decided not to, because I wanted to make it even more mysterious. I felt like I was making something imaginary, like a Sci-Fi film orfantasy film. Maybe I wanted Ichi to be a hero. We put the image on the video screen with CG later. Really? We shot a version where he was actually in this scene. He was sitting right in front of Kakihara. But there was an accident, and the film was damaged. So you re-shot this scene? Yes, but we found out that Arizono couldn't make it that day. He'd already started another project. We were in trouble. We had to improvise. I remembered that Arizono faints and falls when Kakihara cuts his tongue so we decided to put him in the hospital. And they are having a meeting through a videophone. There was no choice. It was trouble. But that kind of trouble puts us into the position where we have to be creative. So the more problems we encounter, the more interesting the film can be. If I didn't hear that story I would just think that the scene was meant to be that way. Being born into this world itself is an accident to me. I don't question why I'm here, but I try to think what I can do. The film becomes more interesting when you encounter a problem. I had to deal with a lot of difficulties while shooting Ichi. But I realized that when I was trying to overcome the troubles I could get closer to the actors. We can feel closer when we're struggling together. You're forced to do something that wasn't planned. If there was no trouble, it doesn't matter who directs it. I'm sure it has something to do with personality but when someone is in trouble, that's when you see his true power. You look like you are good at situations like that. It's not necessarily a good situation, and sometimes I want to run away. But I think I'm looking forward to problems subconsciously. Tsukamoto is making a new film now. He was invited to the Brussels Film Festival, it's known to show bizarre films. It's at Brussels in Belgium. He was a judge for the festival. The head of the judges was Christopher Lee. He's a famous Dracula actor from a long time ago. And in addition to Tsukamoto, there was the guy, Freddy... Freddy from the Nightmare on Elm Street was one of the judges. Dracula, Freddy and Tsukamoto were judging the films. I was at the festival for about a week. It was really funny watching Tsukamoto. He was walking around like a somnambulist. He was a judge, he was forced to watch every film. He had to see 3-4 films a day and he'd come out of the theater exhausted. And the films they show in Fanta are really bizarre. And the films they show in Fanta are really bizarre. He'd have this strange look on his face after each showing. So I'd go ask him what kind of movie it was. He'd tell me, "It's a story about a dog that becomes really big." And the next day, he'd tell me, "A cat was eating people." He was exhausted. Were all films like that? Well, as you could see from the judges, Fanta film festival is more like a cult film festival. There are always many hardcore fans in the festival. There are rooms that you have to dress up in costume to see the events. This film festival always makes me realize how crazy Europe is. And of course, Ichi the Killer was shown at the festival. There was a party at the end of the festival. And you have to wear costumes to participate in the party. A famous film critic, Tokitoshi Shiota, was there too. He was a three-eyed monster. The party was held in the basement of a slaughterhouse. Of course, it wasn't used anymore. It used to be a slaughterhouse. They turned the basement of a huge old slaughterhouse into a dance hall. If you weren't an invited guest, you had to be in costume. It was great. I saw Yoda, even Pikachu. And many costumes are very elaborate. I saw a couple of Kakiharas in the crowd. They had make-up on their mouths. Mr. Shiota wanted to be Kakihara first so he went to one of make-up booths at the party hall. But then he saw a couple of Kakiharas there. So he decided to become a three-eye monster. I don't know why he picked that one, but he looked good. He looks like it's Halloween without any costume on so the third eye made him look even more strange. Were those Kakiharas wearing the same costume? They had something red on. It was right after when it came out so they all had make-up on, but they weren't wearing the same clothes. But majority of the audience was in their late 40s to early 50s. I thought they were cool. Did you decide to do this cheek scene on the set? No, we had it planned, he has fake stretchy cheeks on. Really? Yes, it's all special make-up. You can't really tell the difference between the fake cheek and the real skin. That's what's so great about Matsui. He's a very good special make-up artist but he's almost obsessed when it comes to mutilating body parts. Look at it stretch, it's awful. So this scene was originally in the script? Yes, that's right. The screenplay was written by Sakichi Sato, he's crazy. You can't really describe how it stretches in the script. It didn't say his cheek stretched that much. He was supposed to pull it as much as he could. But human skin doesn't stretch that much. So I thought I would ask Matsui to make it stretch more. I like how she gets so turned on by stretching it. I started thinking about many different things watching this film. I originally created this story, and now I'm watching it as a film... I remember the process we took. I can't remember if there was any scene about Ichi and a kid in the manga. I feel like there was, but I can't remember now. You created the original story, but I usually work with the finished script. So a lot of film people don't feel like they're creating something new. Because we start from making the story into a film. But I started thinking maybe it's more interesting if we come up with the original story and make the film as an extension of the story. I feel like traditional Japanese filmmaking is running out of options. Are you planning to do it? I've been writing a story... I don't know how to explain... It's fun, but I really don't know what to do with it. What do you mean? I have to explain my story to producers, and I'm getting tired of it. The story I'm trying to create is very hard for some people to understand. In your case, you've already gone through the process. Your work has been accepted by the audience and established fans. After all that, it's decided to make it into a film. Making something that has potential to become a film is different than making a film. Just making films can dull your sense of creating something original. I have to change the perspective and create something from the very beginning. Otherwise, it's not going to be my movie. I realized that when I was shooting Ichi. But when I actually write something, I don't know what to do after I finish writing. It doesn't move forward from there. You aren't planning to make it into a film? I'm planning to make a film based on it, eventually. Is it hard to develop the story without seeing the reaction from the audience? It is, and if the producer has an opinion, I have to start it over again. As I write I'll come up with different ideas and concepts then I have to change the budget and the actors according to the story. And I have to think if it's worth going through all that trouble. You found such a perfect apartment. This place had strict regulations but I wanted to use a building in Shinjuku. This scene... This is the face of our AD, Nishiumi. Awful, isn't it? He was useless as an AD, so we decided to use his face. We still worktogether. He used the picture of this face for his new year's cards. Who would want to receive a new year's card with this on it in the beginning of the year, you know? He's a strange guy. Most of my crew also act, and they make money acting, too. Actors are making a film. And my AD has to be able to act well. I see. The professional actors act better when they work with unique actors. The actors were inspired by that ex-kick boxer, Niizuma. Because he isn't acting scary, he is scary. So professional actors give up trying to act scary like him, instead they'll come up with something else to be scary. Many different elements can make a film more interesting. You can't do that in a play. You have to have good actors for a play. If you have one bad actor, he can ruin the whole play. It's different in a film. When actors break the balance in a film, the film can be very interesting. There will be limitless possibilities of what the film will be like. That's true. What's happening now? This is right before he returns to the office filled with organs. He can feel it... You know something is about to happen. Actually I wanted to have ten times more organs than this. When I shoot a scene like this, it makes me want to add more. So we kept adding more organs. That's a lot of organs... Organs are very fascinating. Actually those organs are from just two pigs. Just two? Yes, and it was enough to fill the floor of this room. Originally, I wanted to use one long intestine from esophagus to colon. But I couldn't find it. I heard that you poured vanilla extract all over this room. Yes, the smell was so intense. I hear a lot of people liked this scene. He says a human is made of one long tube... I wanted him to tug it and I'd shoot the beginning of the intestines to the colon. You like organs, don't you? I don't hate organs. One of the differences between my manga and yourfilm was the amount of blood and organs. I imagine it's hard to draw organs in a manga. I think so. I don't thinkthere are any organs in my manga. I don't thinkthere are any organs in my manga. Is he burning the body parts? Yes, on the roof. Outrageous, isn't it? And his son is there playing. They are spending some family time. I like when there are two completely different elements in a scene and the characters are acting normal. The music in this film is the same thing... Usually, the music is composed afterthe movie is made. But the composer, Seiichi Yamamoto, didn't watch the whole movie. He composed the music based on your manga. He spent a long time composing, there are more than 40 songs. I asked him to do whatever he wanted, so the music itself has its own story. None of the music is made for a particular scene. Because that's not the com poser's job, he just creates music. The music is what he felt from the manga, and we just put the music to the film. It was really interesting, we put music to each scene by ourselves. By yourself? Yes, I got to pick the music, and put it right where I wanted. I felt comfortable doing it, too. There he is, Sakichi. This guy here, looks like a real low-life, kicking the guy on the ground is our screenwriter, Sakichi Sato. Did he request to do this scene? No, but we all agreed that only he could do a scene like this. He was typecast. Yes, either him, or Jiro Saburo. When you shot this scene, you asked me if I wanted to be in the film. Did you have any idea when I would show up in this film then? "When" isn't really a problem. It's the matter of where we are in the film. What kind of moment we're in. And we would come up with something for you to do. When we cast, we're not just filling the spots for the characters but if we see someone different from what we're looking for we want our actors to do it the way they can, and enjoy the role. And I'd show it to my friends and see the result. I always make a decision right there on the spot. I'm not good at planning everything in advance and just following the plan. We could be more creative when we encounter a problem. I thinkthat's how a film is made, involving many people. My publishers and I were talking about this scene the other day. We were impressed how this event from the past was put into the story. It's very com plex but very natural. It's at some Chinese restaurant, they are eating ramen... This is actually the first day of filming. Normally filming starts with an easy scene. But because of the schedule, we had to shoot this on the first day. Everyone, the crew and actors, met at this scene for the first time. The scene where Kakihara turns around is the very first shot of Kakihara. This is a very intense scene. That's why we picked a dingy ramen restaurant. If this was a couple of days after we started shooting I'm sure they'd act differently. But I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing and it's waste of time to think about it. Oomori and I didn't discuss what Ichi was like but we just started filming to understand Ichi. I didn't really talk to actors. Because I didn't know what I wanted, either. If I directed actors to act in certain ways, it would be boring. I avoided eye contact with everyone. So they were a little nervous when we started shooting. They didn't know what their motivations were. But knowing what you're supposed to do isn't what actings all about. This is kind of the point where things start to get crazier. Not from the view of someone particular you can feel that all hell will break loose soon. When they walked into the restaurant, they went back to the past. And that restaurant scene is kind of like a midpoint of past and present. And that restaurant scene is kind of like a midpoint of past and present. When I was reading the screenplay, I could tell this was the transition point. I could see a red line on the script. I'm sure different directors see the sign on the different spot. I saw the schedule and we were booked to shoot this scene the first day. So I thought it was fate. This scene was shot a lot later, so Oomori already knew what Ichi was like. It looks very natural, even though it was shot days apart. We don't have the person who records how scenes connect and make sense. As long as the actors act the way they feel I don't care if the scenes don't connect to each other. It doesn't matter if the actors didn't know what they were supposed to do. I'm not too worried about the details like that yet. And I don't think I'm quite there yet, to think about the details like that. I should enjoy myself instead of trying to make a film that makes sense. So I don't think I can become a good director, and I don't wish to be one. Do you know any other director like you? I wonder... But I'm sure there are some. Usually a director is a very intense person, but you aren't like that at all. When I try to be very serious, I fall asleep. Is this the scene where Ichi gets another mission? Yes, Jijii is trying to make him go on one last mission. But Ichi's having doubts about his mission. There they are, Jiro and Saburo. This actor, Suzuki Matsuo... He is unique. He is very mysterious. I rememberwhen we were casting, we were thinking about using real twins but then you said "Let's do it with CG." I thought that was funny. When I thought of these characters, I didn't think we could find perfect twins. I see. Then "twins" became an important element in the story. And it would be really hard to find twins that could act and be unique. If Mitoizumi had a twin brother, it'd be perfect, but that's impossible. It would be scary if there were two of him. It's a different kind of scariness. Sabu hadn't been acting for a while before this. What do you think of him as an actor? I like him. He looks very normal. He was in my films before he started directing. He was probably frustrated from directing. He felt that he could've made a betterfilm if he acted himself. Because he knew exactly what he wanted so he decided to act again. But his pride had been making him avoid acting. So I'm glad that he came out of his shell and started acting again. Are there any bad actors? I'm sure there are some actors that I don't get along with but I always find something interesting about every actor. Or maybe I'm just trying to see anything I can in them so that I can respect them. I'm impressed by a simple thing. Acting is a strange occupation. I wonder if they really think about their future. Maybe that's why I find actors fascinating. There are many film makers in this film like Tsukamoto. He usually directs and acts in his films. I have the actors around me when I make a film but their world is actually far away from mine. Even if I decide to act in my own film I'll just play some joke character. It's not the same as what the real actors do. I don't know how they can do that for a living. I don't think I can live like that. So even if they aren't famous... Actually I respect them even more if they aren't successful. He's casually walking down the street in that costume... You can do that only in Kabukicho. It's a city where anything could happen. Didn't he stand out? Not at all. Some people were saying, "It's Ichi" but they didn't cause a scene or anything. There was a fire in Kabukicho and a lot of people died. But anything that happens in Kabukicho is very unrealistic. You can't tell if it's really happening or just a dream. But the fire actually happened, and many people were burned to death. To me, that incident was more shocking than September 11th. September 11th? The World Trade Center incident. I know what you mean. Kabukicho is like a scene from "Alice in Wonderland." I visit there a lot, but the inside of Kabukicho changes constantly. I even feel uneasy being there. Even the people in the city will be different, but Kabukicho is still there. That's what Kabukicho is like. I can't take this scene, this sound is a little too much... Many people can't take it... Even I thought it was a little too much. Metal against metal. That sound... It sounds a lot nastier than nails on the blackboard. It goes straight to the bones. People who barely made it through the "tongue scene" would walk out here. This is the second point. But if you make it through this scene you're immune to it... That's right, and it's just a matter of how you enjoy the rest of the film. Some people even stop reading manga when there's a scene like this. I would get drawn in. If they made it through the scene, they'd be able to read the rest. But the tongue scene must be the hardest scene. You can sense an even worse situation coming. Did you use CG just for the face? No, we shot Jiro and Saburo separately. He had to play two roles. This is a perfect plan. What do you mean? Usually if an actor has two different roles, he gets paid for each character, but we only had to pay him for one character. So if I had everyone act as twins, the cost for actors would be half. It'll be a story about twins. They are from the twin planet. His keen sense of smell... Originally we were supposed to use a K-9... It said so in the script. But it's really difficult to handle a German Shepard. It would take a long time to shoot. And we'd have to wait for the dog to do what you wanted it to do. We had a lot more to do, and couldn't afford the time. But if we didn't have Matsuo, it would've been different. You could just put ears on Matsuo, and he would be a dog. If it were a different actor, we would've had a different result. Did you consider a different actor for the twins? We had some, but basically our producer Mataro Miyazaki, did the casting. You could see the sense of Miyazaki in the casting. He looks like he could be very anal about those things. He is. This scene, where Kaneko snaps... Was it in the script? He's being seriously violent, so I think it was... I heard a lot of people were surprised by this scene. I think many people felt betrayed. In the end, Kaneko is a human being. Many people felt that they could even be friends with somebody like him. But suddenly his true self is revealed. Because they trusted him, they were shocked even more. He gets enraged and kills the girl. But I could totally understand the mental state he's in. I'm sure you could. To me, his reaction was very natural from the scene of him having the conversation with otheryakuza in the hallway to him getting enraged. ...to him getting enraged. A situation changes someone's perspective. Everyone knows theirtrue self, but they pretend that they don't know it. But your true self comes out once in a while. If you accept yourtrue self, and watch this film you'll understand the characters' feelings in this film. They are very honest about what they believe. They don't lie to themselves. Everyone in this film is very pure. So I felt really good shooting these characters. I didn't have to think about small stuff. This is a good scene. It's also a sad scene. It's like watching wild animals. We ended up using the teeth that look like animal teeth. Normal teeth won't work, especially with that kind of scene. If they were normal teeth, you wouldn't be able to see the teeth and then you wouldn't feel the pain he was in. He almost looks like a monster, and that was the only way to show his teeth. The teeth didn't look like that in other scenes so we decided that his teeth would transform when he bites. CG crew had many questions working on this saying that the scene wasn't making sense. What does "Kawa" mean? Actually... We used the sound effects of crows crying, and they're crying "Kah" there but I've heard crows cry "Kawa." I'm not really sure if it's a different kind of crow or they cry "Kawa" at a certain time of day. All I know that there are crows that cry "Kawa." I thought crows in Japan must be all the same so I tried to find crows crying "Kawa." But I couldn't find them, and we couldn't get the sound. You may not notice it but I'm sure everyone must've heard of it. So when you hear it in this scene, I wanted people to remember it. That's what I wanted to do, but we just couldn't get the sound. I just wanted to show that he only loves things that are different from others. He was looking forthe one that cries "Kawa", so he could feed it. That's the reason behind "Kawa." I found out that you like crows. I find them fascinating. It's scary when they fly to me in a pack... It gives me Goosebumps. ...but they are part of everyday life. They are everywhere we, humans, live. My office is in Shibuya. When I'm in the office, I'll only hear the sound of cars, and crows. They're everywhere, but most people don't like them. We don't even know where they sleep. I like how they are mysterious. I have a lot of CG samples of crows So I can use crows in my films anytime I want. She's speaking in English here but Ichi understands what she's saying. In this film there are no translations involved for the characters. Characters speak their language, and they just understand each other. If this was a film about the difference in culture, it'll be a different story. Nationality doesn't matter in Ichi, but their personalities are more important. That's why we took out the language barrier. Jijii and she have conversation in their own language, Japanese and Chinese. You may find it a little strange but it doesn't bother you much. That's true. Because this film itself is stranger than anything else. Forget the small stuff. This room was really small. It is actually a lot smaller than it looks. You can see that there are only three Tatami and a half in this room. The camera takes up a half a Tatami, it's almost impossible to film. But I really liked this room. And if it were a normal cameraman, it wouldn't have happened. But our cameraman, Hideo Yamamoto, said, "I can do it." When you make a film like Ichi, you can't let problems like that get in the way. It's physically impossible. We used a crane to shoot the shot. So you brought in the crane from outside? Yes, we squeezed a small crane inside. It was crazy. It is a real apartment, right? Yes, it is. How did you find this place? I'd explain what I had in my mind to the location people and they would go look for it. This was actually very close to our office. The wardrobe person, Michiko Kitamura, has an assistant who lives in this apartment complex. They had their studio for making costumes downstairs. There are few areas in Tokyo where you can find an apartment like this like in Okubo, and Nishi Shinjuku. But they are disappearing. That's true... Maybe that's why I wanted to use this apartment. This complex might not be here next year so I wanted to film in there before it's gone. There, her foot is gone but you can see the background where herfoot was. Did you add the background later? We used the shot of the background for where herfoot is. We shot this scene from the same angle twice, with actors, and without actors. We shot this scene from the same angle twice, with actors, and without actors. And we took her foot out from each frame and replaced it with the background. Sounds like a painstaking process. Normally, people use motion-control to do that kind of stuff, but we're very analog, so we just have to work with what we have. But the crew always comes up with something. Even if the method isn't practical the film crew's struggle can create the perfect effect. If we had everything we needed to make a film the quality of the film might be better and professional, but I think it's more interesting to make a film, struggling and improvising. You can see how Asano's enjoying his character here. Did you shoot this later in the filming? Yes, and this room is a set built on the location. This office is built inside a bigger room. We made those walls so this office is inside a bigger office. Using a place like this is different from shooting on a set built in a studio. We created this room in a building in the middle of a city. So it was a different experience for the actors, too. They would go into a normal building and see the set inside the room. I think it affects the way the actors feel on the set. I think so too. It might not be hard to create the set orthe lighting in a studio but you can't feel the reality that you can't see. Was there a scene of his penis getting cut off? No, there wasn't. There was a scene where he was about to, but that's it. Even if we shot the scene, we couldn't show that in the film. In the manga, it was explicitly drawn. But you can't express it like that in a film. I don't have that kind of skill. When you make a film from a manga, you try to compete with the original. But I could be very honest making this film. To me, your manga is a big brother, and my film is a little brother. So it was very easy for me to make it into a film. If I can't express it the way your manga does, I just let the manga win. It was like my safety blanket, I was very comfortable and felt safe. If it wasn't based on a manga, I might've struggled more. I felt like I could be honest with myself. This is another great scene... Looks good, doesn't it? I've seen a lot of commercials that use the same kind of effect. Switching the face of someone on a different body... But you could clearly see there's something wrong with it. That's obviously not his body. It was as if we put so much effort into it to make it look obviously fake. It was as if we put so much effort into it to make it look obviously fake. And I like it that way. If you couldn't tell whether it's real or not, you'd be impressed, and that's it. The CG person who worked on the scene almost had a nervous breakdown. It took three months to create the scene. He had to do it frame by frame. He had to look at the body and Tsukamoto's face everyday for three months. But when someone is working in that kind of situation the finished project is always great. If he had better equipment and better material, it would've made his job easier. But because he was going crazy, this scene became crazier. That kind of job is priceless. In the scene, Tsukamoto's character shows his true personality... I like the way it looks raw. You said it took 3 months to create the scene, but how much did it cost? We had a budget meeting, where we put more money... Isn't using CG expensive? If we calculated the hours the CG crew spent on the machines we would've needed as much as they spend in Hollywood. My crew make their money somewhere else... Putting Tsukamoto's face on top of another body is something you can only do in my film. That's the CG crew's job, but it's not their normal job. They are doing this for fun. So they make money doing other things while I ask them to have fun making my film. But those people need to make money to eat, before they have fun. That's right. People who can make a decent living are strong. Filmmakers like me don't have time to have fun. We're always busy. It's boring if we make ourselves busy just to make something. That's why audiences find my films boring sometimes. There's no resolution to this problem in the Japanese film industry. But you look like you're having fun. I make a lot of films, so I don't have to think about my worries. I try to think that if one movie doesn't do well, I'd still have money to eat. But I keep doing it, so that's why I don't make money. That's how I am, and I can't change that. If I made one film every other year I'm sure the quality of my films would be different. But I can't spend two years on Ichi. If I spent two years, that would make me go insane. You're right. I have to understand that I'm making something beyond human understanding. But then there's a question ofwhether I can make something I don't understand. So I told myself that I'd make this film to have fun. For this film, I actually made the time to have fun for myself. I controlled the time just for myself, and decided to have fun. I think many film directors make their best work when they are not forced nor pressured to make a film. I know what you mean. It's like sex, You'll have better sex when it's unexpected than when you're all tense and preoccupied having sex. I like the way you described that. I'd love to have sex unexpectedly. I'd really like that, unexpected sex. The crushed face there... It was in the exhibition of Ichi at Parco... You could see from the other side of the face. ...so everyone could experience the world of Ichi. Were there any otherfaces? Shin Sugata's face was there. I had a ticket, but I forgot to bring it that day, so I paid to get in. What's that white stuff? I think Ichi ejaculated. What detailed work. So he has his penis out? I guess he came in when Ichi was jerking off. It's getting close to the climax. I was still writing Ichi around this time so the climax of the film was very different from the manga. I asked you what was going to happen but then you asked me the same question in return. Yes, I did. How many endings did you think of for Ichi? I only thought of one. If Kakihara gets caught right here, I'd just think ofwhat happens next. Then I don't think about what if he doesn't get caught. I see. Is there any reason it's daytime? It's difficult to shoot a film in the city at night. You have to think about the light, time and other technical stuff. But if you use the natural light, it's a lot easier. Besides, I wanted to shoot Ichi under sunlight. The kids are playing somewhere, and they are killing each other on the roof. I thought it was very healthy. They are all outside, under sunlight. It was really cold. Middle of December. It was so cold that it was difficult to just stand still. Actors are strange. They look even happier when they're in a horrible situation. Everything was done according to the script? Yes, but Sato's script doesn't say exactly what the actors are supposed to say. How they move or what's happening are very clear in his script. So if ten people read the script, ten people bring their ideas to the dialogue. You have to assume how they're feeling. For example, when you see the kid you'll think about many different possibilities. You can use the kid to emphasize the violence in this scene. But also it could be a great moment between father and son. We didn't try to force the audience to have certain feelings. So everything is done by the script, but how the audience will feel about each scene might be different. I guess the theme changes depending on how its shot. Yes, we all had different feelings about Ichi when we were shooting. There were some scenes where I explained how I want the scene to be but for the scenes toward the end, I only directed the camera angles. But I left the crew to think about how they were supposed to feel. Otherwise this film couldn't be completed. We weren't trying to achieve one thing together. He is Kakihara, but also Tadanobu Asano. How he thinks about his fate is up to him. That's not something I should be directing. Did you shoot these scenes many times? No, most of them are one-take. Just a single take. You usually rehearse actor's lines and the camera work, but this isn't the kind of scene you rehearse so many times. If we rehearse, we would get something we could replicate next year. But if we just rehearse once ortwice the scene and the way Asano plays Kakihara are very original. That's why we didn't rehearse that much. Even the cameraman was having a hard time framing characters in the shot. That was up to them too? Yes. Really? I explain what's happening, but I let them do everything. I thought the shots were directed. Well, I told them the angle of the camera and directions, but where the characters will be in the frame wasn't directed. He is going to sit right here, and the cameraman knows he's sitting but how he sits, or whether he just sits or pauses and sits... You couldn't expect those kind of things when he was shooting. But then when the cameraman would have a certain shot right it would look like everything was precisely planned. I would direct him sometimes but I'd rather let him do what he wants to do. I love the expression on his face. I don't want to die like that. If that wasn't Asano, it would be totally different. Like the way he falls... If that wasn't Asano, it would be totally different. Like the way he falls... And I would have a different feeling for his death. But it makes me feel excited to see him losing his balance on the edge. I don't know how to explain it. He isn't trying to save himself. He looks curious when he's falling. That's his desire, he wants to know how it feels to die. You feel like you're going to fall when you stand on the edge of a tall building. You want to try to lean over, maybe it's close to that feeling. He doesn't fall out, but he falls into the pit, surrounded by other buildings. That's very Kakihara. He was talking right before he dies, I'd want to faint if it were me. He is really enjoying it, he's expressing it verbally. I didn't put any sound when he actually hit the ground but he was acting really cool the moment before he died. There are so many different poses when someone falls to their death. Why did you choose that pose? I wanted him to look like he was running. Really? Yes, I want him to die refreshingly. It's the end, but looks like it's the beginning of something. It does look like he's running. We spent a long time on how he should pose. I remember. If we shot the scene another day, it would be different. Some people shoot a couple of different shots but I like having only one possibility, rather than having many possibilities. These credits are confusing. I watched it twice, but I couldn't find my name. Everyone's name is in here. But if you put them all together, you can't see it. Too much information can be useless. It's better if it's going up, but it sucks if your name is one that's going down. Some of them are upside down, and falling down. The original authors look forward to seeing their names in the beginning and the end. So I feel half satisfied. I'm sorry. I'll have to pause it to find my name. But there is another "Hideo Yamamoto", so it might be easier to spot it. Yeah, but I don't know which one is me. It says "original story by." Okay, good. That's it. First Avenue, Kabuki-cho - Are you sure, Mr. Fujiwara? - You know what the boss said. He doesn't need a bodyguard. At least not in the apartment. But why not let me keep a look-out outside his door? While he's fucking a girl? That's not what I mean. You're only a bodyguard, so just shut the fuck up until you're needed. Hello. Is that you, Takeshi? You're coming home soon, aren't you? You're not leaving too, are you? No Takeshi, I won't leave you. I'm at work. - I'll call back later. - Dad, Dad... Tadanobu Asano Hideo Yamamoto Takashi Miike Stop it. No! No! Cut it out. No! Stop it, please. How does that feel? Who's there? Who the hell...! Ichi the Killer Hi, Myu-Myu? It's me. - Inoue, don't! - I thought I'd strengthen my resolve No need. Ichi will take care of everything. Lately we only go in to clean up after Ichi. Found it. I thought I told you to quit. - What the hell? - If I can't shoot up, - Don't do that! - you can't use my phone. Let's go. He did it again. As gross as ever. What's this guy Ichi like, anyway? Let's get started. What the hell happened here? You were guarding the boss last night. - So was Kaneko. - Don't try and pass the blame. Sorry. My apologies. Mr. Kaneko, any idea where he might be? Oh, Sir! Welcome! Has Anjo really disappeared? How much money is missing? About three million yen. Then I guess Anjo took the money... and ran off with the girl. Sir, the boss would never do such a thing. Never. All that time he spent in jail... must have softened his brain. A guy grows old, gets obsessed with a broad and can't even tell his ass from a hole in the ground. Probably some other gang is behind it, sir. There are many who bear us a grudge. It's not Anjo who made enemies. You did. The boss is not dead. Please excuse us. - Don't you have a girlfriend? - No. It gets lonely, you know. - Why don't you get yourself a pet? - I used to have an alligator. but they get hard to handle so I flushed it down the toilet. I see. - What kind? - A mongrel. He was so cute. But this bloke next door... He made fun of it. So I started praying. Welcome. - Is Karen here? - She's there. Follow me. - My wish was fulfilled. - Really? It died. It did? C'mon, have another. - Masa. - Did you hear? The boss has disappeared. If he ran off at all it would've been with you. Another gang has got him. What are you going to do now? He's not dead. I'll find him. I'm sure you will. Don't fool with me, Karen. He's alive. I'm dead sure of it. He's just waiting for me to find him. Yeah, but... You're the boss's woman. What are you talking about? I'm sorry. Is it a birthday party? It's my birthday. Today's your birthday? - Then this is your present. - I thought I told you to quit. They are outcasts from the gangs. Murder, arson, smuggling and rape. How have you been? So you're back in Shinjuku, huh? This is the only place... where guys like us can make a living. Did you hear what happened at our place? More or less. When you hear anything, I want to know. There'll be a reward. I see. Kill yourself. I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Hurry up and die. Hurry up and die. I'm sorry. I have no use for your stupid apologies. Stop crying. You can shed all the tears you want. I'll only forgive you when you're dead. You stupid son of a bitch. I don't want to hear that you haven't found him yet. Give me that. I want you to turn Shinjuku inside out until you find the boss! Don't show your face until you do. Chief, so far we haven't found any clues. That doesn't mean, of course... that I've abandoned all hope. I'll find him. Just leave it to me. I'll get it. It's just a rumor. Hard to say how much of it is true. But the Funakis belong to the Sanko syndicate, just like us. They even share the building with us. Exactly. That way they can keep tabs on who's coming and going. - They probably staked out your boss. - Why do that? Well, Mr. Kakihara, three years ago you yourself cut Mr. Suzuki of the Funaki family out of a porn video sales racket. Word has it that he hasn't forgotten. So, you think Suzuki is behind all this? It's only a rumor. But behind your back Mr. Suzuki is bad-mouthing you. He's spread some pretty ridiculous stories. He even said you had a crush on boss Anjo. What the hell are you talking about? Takayama, bring him here. Bring who? Suzuki, of course. But... You got cold feet? That's not the problem. We don't have any proof. Since when do you care about proof? If he lies we'll give his corpse to Funaki. Get on with it, Takayama. OK. Jijii, go buy some shrimp. Shrimp? Kakihara? Tempura? What the hell's going on here? Kakihara! What the fuck is this? You look fantastic, Mr. Suzuki. Where is the boss? The boss? You mean Anjo? He and that girl bolted. Made off with your money, right? You're not listening to me. Wait. Stop, damn it! You think I took boss Anjo? I know you're pissed off because I dealt you out of that video deal. You've been going around bad-mouthing us. No, I haven't. Yes, you have. Ain't that right, Jijii? Who the hell are you? You say you didn't dub adult videos behind Mr. Kakihara's back? That proves you can't be trusted. OK, it's true about the videos. I'll admit that. But I know nothing about your boss. You have to believe me, please. I'll ask you again. Where is the boss? I don't know. I really have no idea. - Chief, that's too... - Wait. Hey, wait! I wonder how Jijii managed to get a camera and a mike in there? I put them there. You did? Jijii talked me into it before I was kicked out of the Anjo gang. So you were buddies with Kakihara? He wouldn't recognize me now. I had a face job. Plastic surgery? Why did you choose this face? Shut up! Right, I have to make a call. You about ready to come clean? I'm going to kill all of you. Once again. Where is the boss? How would I know? Somebody's already killed him! He's still alive. So what? If you won't talk, maybe your little one will. No. Don't do that. I'll do anything you want if you just stop! What the hell? Is that you, Suzuki? Kakihara! What the fuck do you think you are doing? Just a little torture. What did Suzuki do? Don't! Put that away, Mr. Kaneko. Who the hell are you? You tell us first what you are doing here, Mr. Funaki. Someone called to say Suzuki was in big trouble with your gang. He thinks I kidnapped his boss. Suzuki would never do such a stupid thing. Let him go. - In this together, are you? - What? Hey! We were tipped off that Suzuki had taken the boss. By who? That guy there... - Well, who? - That guy Jijii. What guy? You! Go and find him! Yes sir! Hello. So you came back. You are the only one who enjoys seeing a girl's body all black-and-blue. How... What do you mean, 'how'? Tell me about the beating you got yesterday? What do you mean? Did it hurt? I thought I was going to die. The bastard. I wish he would die. Die... Yes, I wish he would die. Shall I kill him for you? - Ten million yen? - No, you idiot. A hundred million! That seems like a fair sum. We don't have that much. So hand the video business over to us and that'll settle the matter. All of our money disappeared with the boss. Take our video business too and we'll have to fold. You think I'd let you off that easily? Throw this guy out of the syndicate. That makes it a lot easier. Maybe you're right. I'll make a sincere apology. This is not a matter of cutting one or two fingers - I have a taste for sweet things. - So what? To apologize, I'll cut my source of pleasure. What do you mean? He-o, it's Kakiha-a. T-at you, Ka-en? Yes, all right, I'm on my way. I'm going to look for the boss. Sir! Sir! I had to stop at the hospital. The hospital? That's disgusting. Look, it's amazing. It's all right. The human body regenerates itself. If I keep talking it'll get better, right? Who is it? It's Karen, from the Hirando club. Good morning. Have you heard from him? I don't owe you a thing so why should I tell you anything? If you're not here to score, just fuck off. How dare you come here empty-handed and ask me for a favor. Who the hell do you think you are? This is Kakihara. The guy with the body piercings from the Anjo gang. Hey, who said you could come in? I don't care who he is. I don't associate with the likes of you. The boss is going to die. What's this guy talking about? If I don't hurry, the boss will die. Like I said, if you're not here to score you're in the way. So get the hell out. Scram! Do you know what'll happen if he dies? Jijii, hurry back here and give me a hit. He was already in there when we arrived. I taped it up in case he tries to escape. Where's your boss, Jijii? What's this? That's our office. Look what I found. Boss Anjo... So you guys kidnapped him. Where is boss Anjo? I'll tell you if you shoot me up first. I'm asking you. Where's the boss? He's long dead and buried. If I'm not getting a shot then hurry up and kill me, brother Kakihara. Who are you? I know your methods. If you're going to kill me anyway just get it over with, brother Kakihara. Kano? Jackpot. Kano? Are you Kano? But your face is different. So you killed the boss? It was Ichi who did it. Who is this 'Ichi'? I only cleaned up after him. It seems that Ichi's next target is you, brother Kakihara. You had the hots for Anjo, didn't you? Not because you're queer or because you admired his balls. It was because you relished the pain that he inflicted when he beat you up. That's why you want to find him so badly. Am I right? You need him to hurt you again. I'm going to get you for this. Kakihara, I'll never forget what you did. I'm going to kill you, you bastard. What did you do with the girl? He asked where Anjo's girl is. The girl? We want the girl you took along with Anjo. Return her to us right now. Wait a minute. You're also making a mistake. We'll kill you. If you don't say something, we'll kill the whole gang. W-Wait! Will you listen, damn it? I didn't do it. I've got nothing to do with it. I'm innocent. Believe me, please. Ask somebody else, please. - Time is running out. - Time's up. What do you mean? We'll cut you here. It won't hurt much. No, please. Help! Hello? Yes. I understand. Someone says he saw a man with a torn mouth attack Anjo's office. That's Kakihara. I knew it! I can't breathe in this mask. I should've cut the eyes a little higher. It fogs up when I breathe. Hi Myu-Myu. How are you? This is it? Stop it! You know what I'm saying? Stop hitting me! Tell me. You can suck dicks, you have a cunt and this is all you earn? How can I get clients if you keep busting my face? Shut up, you bitch! How does that feel? Who the fuck are you? Come in here, you little shit. What the fuck are you doing? Are you some kind of pervert? What the fuck is this costume? Say something. Can't you talk, asshole? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't bullshit me saying "I'm sorry." Why are you crying? - I'm not crying. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not. - I can see it. - You're fucking crying! - No, I'm not! What the fuck? What did you do? I killed him for you. I'm telling you. Case will go to a jury before tomorrow afternoon. How about a statement for the press, Mr. Prentice? I'd like to oblige you but I have nothing to state. Why don't you see the district attorney? He's probably full of statements. Oh, uh... - What luck? - Everything is fine. I found a doctor in Brooklyn, Gillette, got the x-ray plates. - When can I see him? - Any time after 6. - Have him at my house at 8:30. - Right. - Have Dr. Lyons and the nurse there. EDDIE: Right. - Good night, Mr. Prentice. - Good night, Lloyd. Good night. I don't think you need wait, Mrs. Harrison. - I'm a little worried now, Mr. Prentice. - Why? I'm not. You're not on trial for manslaughter. - Will you do me a favor? - Certainly. Go see a show tonight, forget all about this. You have nothing to worry about. Well, I'm in your hands. - Sorry? - You know I'm not. [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Good night. And don't worry. - Good night. Both doctors and the nurse will be at my house at half past 8. - Aren't you forgetting about tonight? - Tonight? Mrs. Prentice is entertaining your house guest. - House guest? - Ms. Drexel. Oh, of course. Well, I don't see how I can make it. But I'd like to drop in for a cocktail. Have Delaney change appointment from my house to my office. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. [IN FRENCH ACCENT] Oh, bonsoir, Albert. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Hello, Evelyn. - Hello, darling. - Being the little woman about the house? Yes, like to help? [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] Your dress is charming. Oh. Look at all the forks. One, two, three. Hurray, we're gonna have an entrée. I put your friend Chester Wylie next to you. Besides being a very bad drinker, what is he? Well, he thinks he's an artist. I met him in Paris, has a studio in Greenwich Village, shack in Connecticut. The modern school, you know? Draws lines that look like a skyscraper then tells you it's a sleeping dog. Adores canned peas. [CHUCKLES] And in spite of that, I sort of like him. - Here, let me do that. - Are you good? Darling, I'm perfect. The last time I mixed a cocktail, four people eloped and a man made love to his wife. Oh, then, please do it. - Gin and French vermouth. - Anything else? Sure, cognac, absinthe and a dash of bitters. Oh, Amy, you'll kill my guests. Now, these are respectable people. Marriage has changed you a lot, Evelyn. You used to have plenty of zip and bounce. And now you're so old, so good and bounce-less. - Does your husband beat you? - No, I wish he did. - He'd have to come home to do it. - Not necessarily. I know a gentleman who beat his wife in a night club and she loved it too. Where's the ice? - Here. - Oh. No, I'm lucky if I have dinner with John once a week. - Don't tell me that you and he... - Oh, no. No, I love him more than ever and he loves me. But I'm sick and tired of the word "law." [INTERCOM BUZZES] And everything that goes with it. Yes? I'll be right up. Dorothy wants me to say good night to her. If the guests come, will you take care of them? After my cocktails, they won't know whether you're here or not. Take it easy. Ho hum. Good night, dear. Can't I stay up and see the company? Oh, no, darling. It's a grown-up party. Kiss Mommy good night. And one for Daddy? Oh, dear. I'm always kissing you for Daddy. I this is literally the last thing that I thought we would be doing, but I am really proud of you. - What's that? - Oh, sorry. Old smile. Won't happen again. Thank you. Go. Go, go, go. Sir, I'm sorry, there's no late admissions. - NBC4 gold pass. - What? - Gold pass! - Oh. - Dad! - Dad, you're here!

[bong bubbles] Today, I was driving along in my car, and by "car," I mean car-dboard box with wheels painted on it, and I came across an old woman, and she was carrying the most beautiful, shiny toaster I had ever seen. [bicycle horn honks] So I stopped my car... ardboard box, I got out, and I said, "excuse me, miss, that... "that toaster is... is marvelous. I-I was wondering if I could pay you for it." And she said, "no, it's not for sale. It's my toaster, I'm not selling it to anybody." And I said, "miss, I implore you, I need that toaster. It's... it's so beautiful. I-I want to stick my genitalia in it." And she said, "wha... whe... whi... eh!" And I said, "oh, that... that wasn't... "I don't think that was English or any type of human language. I think you just barked like a dog." And she said, "[babbling]." And I said, "I don't know what you're saying, "but I'm going to break your neck if you don't give me that toaster, you [bleep] bitch." And she was like, "[babbling]." And then I murdered her. I murdered her for that beautiful, shiny toaster, and I [bleep] the shit out of it later that night. I made that toaster my bitch.

[applause] Mom, Dad, I found this in your room, and I have a question. [chuckles] Honey, I think it's time we have - that birds and bees talk. - Oh, dear lord. [laugh track] But Dad, I learned all about the birds and bees and other wildlife while in the scouts. [laugh track] - No, sweetie, this is different. - Yes, son. When a mommy bird and a daddy bee love each other, they will come together and make a baby. However, sometimes, the birds like to stung by the bees for fun. [laugh track] Other times, the bees like to be choked by the birds. Sometimes, the bird and bee will switch roles... [laugh track] where the bee gets stung by a fake stinger that the bird wears. [laugh track] Then there are times when the bird wears a mask, where she has to trust the bee to do things that hurt in the beginning, but in the end, feel amazing. [laugh track] Other times, a bee will hook up with another bee, but it's cool, because it was in a hot tub. Sometimes, a bird likes to get stung by many different bees in a row, while she was in college. Sometimes, the bee goes to Vegas and sleeps with a strange bird. Then he finds out that the bird has a stinger. [laugh track] That bee had to kill that bird - and leave the body outside the city. - Uh-oh. - Sometimes, the... - Mom? Dad? Are we still talking about the birds and the bees? [both chuckle] [laugh track] [cheers and applause] Okay, fine, go ahead, tell me. Okay, here we go, man. So picture this. All of a sudden, a cute, little unicorn drops in out of the sky onto this little cliff, and he's standing on the edge, terrified. The only way out is through this chainsaw pit with swords and knives and blades swinging all around, so he sucks it up like a true unicorn man would, he jumps over the chainsaws, finally makes it to the other side. Clear out of nowhere comes this Viking son of a bitch, and kicks him off the cliff, and he falls down into the spikes, dead meat, guts all over. Poor unicorn. That is the absolute worst idea ever. It would never get made. That show would never get made. [death metal screaming] # The last dead unicorn! # [grunts] [screams] Are you all right, Dad? You seem a little edgy. No edge. I'm good.

I'm on a schedule. Hey, do they still sell apples off the backs of trucks along here? I don't know. How about I drive? No, you can't. Your name is not on the contract. Hop in. You know, if you didn't drink so much water, you wouldn't have to wee so much. Yeah? But I've got the liver of a 20-year-old. Put the headlights on. Why? Don't you trust the sun? It's a long-distance drive. It's for safety. Oh, guess what I found? (SUMMER LOVE BY SHERBET PLAYS) Remember, you used to sing this to me? (GROANS) No. RADIO: # Summer love is like no other love # Ooh, yeah # Summer love is like no other love... # Did Lewis get away with her? Oh, yeah. Look, Belle and Lewis just need to deal with their past. You know, all that guilt and regret that's built up over the years - it's like a big boil, and they need to lance it. Come on, kids. We're running late. What's the matter? My shoes are too small. You've only had them for a month. Come on, give us a look. There's heaps of room in there. He wants new runners - cool ones. They're on sale. Take a look. Oh, you got the brochure. How convenient. They're how much? They're cheaper if you buy two pairs. Hm. I'm sure. Come on. Since when do you need the budget of a small island nation to buy school shoes? A lot of small island nations are broke, mate. Yeah, because all the kids want runners made by designers. Hey, boys, back to business. Quiz Night. Kane, I'll clear the lines and tap the kegs, if you pick up the prizes. Has Lewis written the questions? Covered. I'll write them. They're not all about sport, are they? It's a sports quiz. Dickhead alert. All on board for Lily's party this afternoon? Yeah, yeah. Stella's really excited. Hey, you do party entertainment, yeah? Super K. Er, yeah. Is there any chance that you'd be available this afternoon? It's just that my clown dropped out. We've got stuff to do at the pub. Oh, it'll only be for an hour. Well... No. We're a man down, so... So, this pub of yours is a four-man democracy as long as everyone does what you say? That's interesting business. And we're minding it. You wanna mind yours? Never made captain in your playing days, did ya? (CHUCKLES) You're paying cash, right? Er, yeah. Yeah, we are. I need the money, OK? Mark's got a second business. Lewis can piss off without notice, and I try to take one gig. It's not any gig, though, is it? You don't like Will. I get that. I just don't trust him. He conned us out of two grand, mate. You don't know that. He used you once to get information about this place, so he can buy it. Well, then, I won't talk about the pub. No conversations about the pub. Happy? Hey, how big is the party? Most of the class are going. Well, how come Poppy didn't get invited? The boys say anything about Poppy not getting invited to things? Nup. Were they invited? Yeah. They're looking forward to it. Isn't that right, Super K? Hey, what's the big deal? Will can make as many offers as he likes. We just gotta say no. Yeah, well, have you ever heard the expression, 'divide and conquer'? Have you ever heard of Kane's Pies? That's my first business I had to give up to help run this place. Does it hurt that you never got the captaincy? Oh, that's really funny. No. I'm joking. Oh! (GROANS) You all right, mate? I don't think so. I can't believe you've sprained it again. I can. Well, it's only gonna get better if you keep the knee immobile, and starting next week, you're doing the strengthening exercises. I've been doing the exercises. Yeah, once a month doesn't count, and stop being paranoid. Poppy. Just because you had no friends at school doesn't mean she'll be unpopular too. I had friends at school. (CHUCKLES) I just didn't stab them with adrenaline pens. Do you think that's why she wasn't invited to the party? Well, it did cross my mind. What are you doing? I gotta do the BAS statement for the pub. Pass me the receipts. Oh, and the waste paper bin too. Anything else before I leave? It's an invite to Will's daughter's party. Why wouldn't she tell us? Sure it's the right address? Yeah. Giddy Up Enterprises. 6 East Bourne Crescent. This is it. Yeah. It doesn't look much like a business. No. This is just where the business is registered. His actual business happens all over the place. Yeah, well, nobody's home. Well, we could ask some neighbours if they'd seen him. Belle, where are you going? I need to pee. What, again? You can't pee in the yard. Yeah? Thanks for that. Hello? Hello? Is anyone home? Is this how you want to be introduced to Ned? "Hi, I'm your mother. Can I use your loo?" Why not? Ooh. Door's open. You can't go in, Belle. You're the one in a hurry. Belle. Ned? Hello? Belle, there'll be a loo at the pub in town. Well, there's one just here. (DOOR CLOSES) (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC) (WHIMPERING SOUND) Hey! (DOG BARKS) Hey! Hey! Come back here! Hey, Belle! Get out here now! What the hell is going on? We let the dog out. It's gone! What do you mean 'we'? I didn't even know there was a dog. Come on! Oh, oh, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna drive around till we find it. Give me the keys. No, you're not driving. I told you that before. You're not allowed. You drive. Just...go that way. Stop yelling at me. Why does everything have to be so bloody complicated with you? What are you talking about? You're the one that lost the dog. (TYRES SQUEAL) Phoebe said she'd call. She never calls. She just rang. That was a text, and when I do speak to her, she's really happy. Isn't that a good thing? I'd feel better if she sounded a bit lonely. One month out on the road with that rock star dude. It's a love story waiting to happen. Doesn't what's-his-face have a girlfriend? So what? Phoebe's beautiful. It's like Mr Crabb hanging out with the first Mrs Crabb. (MOBILE PHONE RINGS) You must be a bit jealous. How's it going? Yeah, good. What's the name of the account the bank gave you? You know, where the cheque was deposited. Er, Giddy Up Enterprises. Yeah. Can you check that address for me? I'm at work, Lewis. Oh, right. Sorry. Yeah. Listen, are you lost? No, no. I just wanna make sure I got the right place. GEMMA: Have you only just got there? No. Well, kind of. Nobody's seen this bloody dog. What dog? That girl there is a drug addict. She's looking for a free fix. She says she's got pain in her stomach. She's bunging it on. Give her two paracetamol, and send her home. Now what's going on? I'm just... (CAR HORN HONKS) I'm gonna be a bit later than I thought getting back. (HONKING CONTINUES) OK. Yeah, I gotta go. Bye. Bye-bye. You broke into a stranger's house. BELLE: Ned's not a stranger. He's our son. I don't think it's his house. (SIREN BLARES) Perfect. How fast were you going? Shut up, Lewis. At least you know you're alive. Oh, sorry, Officer, if I was going a bit fast. You know, these triple carbie's accelerator linkage can get a little bit twitchy. Did you enter a house in East Bourne Crescent a half-hour ago? Oh, erm... ..maybe. He's practically still a puppy. LEWIS: Yeah. He's an excitable little fella, isn't he? You waltzed into my house and let my dog out. I have an incompetent bladder. What? We've been looking for the dog. And we will keep on looking all day, if that's what's required. Yeah. I mean, well, we have to call it quits, at some point. Who are you, people? We're looking for Ned Hogarth. We're his parents. I knew Ned's parents. You're not them. We're his birth parents. Yeah, see, I gave him this cheque for $10,000... Ned gave me that money. You're not getting it. No, I don't... I don't want the money. Is this Ned's house? It's my house. You want us to pursue this and press charges? (SIGHS) No. I'm sorry. Are you Ned's partner or...? Sometimes. We'd really like to talk to Ned. I have no idea where he is. He went back to the city. Do you know when he'll be back? Sooner or later, I guess. Well, erm, when you do see Ned, could you please give him that? If you wanna come with us, we're gonna go... Just go away. (POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYS) So, why don't we put them down on this side, and then it looks nice and even? Isn't that lovely? No, no, no. Wait till everyone gets here. You can open them all up together, yeah? Why don't you help the girls put up the streamers? Wow. Look at you. This is strictly business, yeah? When a man turns up wearing his underpants on the outside of his clothes, what else could it be? We're not talking about the pub. This afternoon, no conversations about the pub, OK? Your call. What do you want to talk about? The weather? Too personal. How about kissing? Definitely not. Wow. You're really narrowing down the field. Did you bring a list? Let's talk about Lily. What kind of games does she like? Whatever makes her the centre of attention. I can manage that. Hey... ..are you sure that you don't want to talk about kissing, cos I got a feeling, just quietly, that you might be an expert in the subject. I better go get set up. Hey, Kane. What's the pub's monthly turnover? I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ON MOBILE PHONE) I'm so sorry I'm late. Sure. Whatevs. Erm, sweetie, I found Lily's party invitation at home. Why didn't you tell us you're invited? I forgot. I was wondering if she'd have to spend the night. So sorry. Mark sprained his knee, and... That is a beautiful necklace. I'm pleased I caught you. I need a statutory declaration from you about last week, explaining how the children were left unsupervised, because you insisted on having a discussion with me in class time. Of course. I'm so sorry this is dragging on. Me too. Did you know that there is a sports quiz on at the pub tonight? No, I didn't. Oh, you should come. There's still tickets for sale. What a shame, I lost my purse. Well, er, we can always go to Lily's party now. I think it's just starting. I feel sick. (COUGHS) Poppy loves parties. She wouldn't forget if she was invited to one. She doesn't have a temperature. I'm thirsty. (COUGHS) That's a nasty cough, darling. It's a pity. It's gonna be a fun party. Super K is gonna be there. Super K is lame. Don't be rude about your uncle. And since when do you use the word 'lame'? Whatevs. Or 'whatevs'? All of your friends are gonna be there. They're not my friends! Is anyone being mean to you at school? Yes. Well, what are they doing, sweetheart? What are they saying? Maybe you should hang out with Stella... I'm not going! You can't make me! Hey. Hi. Does Lily like Lego? Yeah, yeah. I think she does. Good. Good. She'll love this. Poppy picked it out herself, cos Poppy really likes Lily, and all the kids in her class, actually. It's the Great Pyramid of Giza. Oh, wow. Thank you. And we even got some dead Egyptian slaves you can just pop inside. Oh, great. Well, thank you. And, hey, it's a shame that Poppy's not feeling well. Ah. She'll bounce back. Hey, Will, is everything OK about last week with the whole adrenaline pen? Oh, yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it. Yeah, it's fine. And thank you for the present. Are you sure? Yeah. MAN: Hey. OK. Poppy made it, after all. No. She's at home, sick, sort of. Ah. So, why are you here? I'm delivering the present. Oh. Hey, erm, the boys reckon Poppy's not speaking to them anymore because she's got new friends. What new friends? KANE: OK, kids. Time for a break. Everyone, go to the table. Grab a drink. Grab something to eat. I'm heading back to the pub. Oh, cool. Hey, I'll see you tonight. You coming? With you hosting, why wouldn't I be there? Weighing up Justin is like shooting fish in a barrel. OK. Justin - another subject off the list. He was never on it. All right, kids, break's over. Time to go get some bad guys. You can't defeat me! (KIDS LAUGH) I have other friends with superpowers that will come and rescue us. You're not counting on me, are you? My only superpowers are wiggling my ears. OK. Now you all have to go and hide. When I break out of these binds, the first two of you we find will have the same thing done to them! Now go! (KIDS LAUGH) Is this a standard game or were you saving it just for me? Standard. I'm crushed. How long do we sit here for? A couple of minutes. Have you always known that you're...? A superhero? Or did you jump the fence after Stella was born? Stella is my ex's niece. It's pretty complicated. But, yeah, I've always known. So, how did Lily come along? Lily was an arrangement with a very good friend of mine, whose biological clock was ticking, and then after Lily was born, she got lucky - met the man of her dreams, so lucky her. So, you share custody? Yeah, yeah. It's a really good arrangement. Hey, I hate to break it to you, but we just had a conversation. OK! Here, I come! Ready or not! All right. I wrote that letter, hoping it would never be needed. That I'd just be able to tell Ned everything. You think he's gonna see it now? Now that we've lost that dog? Probably not. What did it say? Just that I never stopped thinking about him. Did you? (SIGHS) Let's just admit it, Lewis. The whole idea of putting all our thoughts of Ned in a box, and pretending he wasn't there was crazy. Every now and again, I'd see someone in the street... ..I'd wonder if it was him, but... You had plenty of other distractions. Hey, hey, that's the dog! Where? There! Hey! Run, Lewis! Don't let him cross the road! (STAMMERS) (CAR HORN HONKS) (SCREECHING) Tell us about these new friends you've got. They're cool. Do we know any of them? Don't think so. Well, as you get older, you will make new friends. That's good. It's what life's all about. That doesn't mean your other friends are not your friends anymore. Yeah. You just get a wider circle. It's like a jar that never fills up. A jar of best friends? Well, not everyone could be your best friend. And best friends change. But you don't wanna change them too much. No. You don't wanna be fickle. Commitment's important. A friend in need is a friend, indeed. Where are we now? If you would like to invite one of your new friends over for a play, that is fine. Can Sylvie come over? Sure. Yes. Yay! I'll tell her. If you just give me her parent's phone number, I'll give them a call. (ELECTRONIC TAPPING) (MOBILE PHONE BEEPS) What are you doing, sweetie? Sylvie's on facechat. I downloaded the app. (MOUTHS) We were gonna leave, but then we saw her dog again, and we sort of chased it into an oncoming car, and he broke his leg, so we're at the vet now. Back up a bit. Why is the dog your responsibility? Well, it ran out of the house when we got there. So, the door was open. Yeah. GEMMA: Yeah. So, how is that your fault, then? Lewis? Yeah, I'm here. Why do I feel like I'm not getting the full story? Gemma, I don't think I'm gonna get back for the start of the quiz. Well, how long will you be? Not too long. I just got a couple of loose ends to tie up. What loose ends? I'll call you when I'm leaving. See ya. What loose ends? You'll be all right. Doctor's coming. Acute appendicitis. She needed more than paracetamol. We are both very sorry. You've been saying that a lot today. This is Sam. Hey. Hey, Sam. Tizz is your dog, isn't he? Don't you worry, cos the vet's looking after him. When he comes out, he's gonna be as right as rain, OK? OK. Is he Ned's? Yeah. Mum, Tizz's ball! Quick, we forgot it! We'll get it later. Let me speak to the vet, sweetie. I could get Tizz's ball. I know how to get inside. Erm, it's a rubber ball, next to his food bowl in the backroom. Lewis. We have a grandson. (POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYS) Looby lost her purse, so I bought her a new one. What do you think? Is there a forgiveness for sale? It's gotta be worth a shot. (KNOCKING) Yes? Poppy here? Yes. How can I help you? I'm Sylvie. Hi, Sylvie! Nice to meet you. Poppy's in her roo... I know where it is. (SOFTLY) Did you see that? (WHISPERS) I can't hear anything. What are they doing in there? (SOFTLY) Poppy is hanging out with pubescent girls. Rude ones. How did this happen without us noticing? Look, it didn't. We've noticed. The door's closed. Are we happy about that? How cool is that? Cool. What are you watching? (ROCK MUSIC PLAYS) Poppy, I asked you a question. What are you watching? Just some randoms. Doing what? Getting drunk, falling over and stuff. OK. Well, can you turn that off, please? Shut up. It's mine. OK. You can go right now. Whatevs. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) How long have you and Sylvie been friends? I'm friends with her gang. She's in Year 5. How did you become friends? She says I should inject Ms Looby with ink. What? Duh. I didn't do it. Are you saying that Sylvie and her friends think you're cool because of the incident with the adrenaline pen? Yep. Well, here's what I think. You can't be friends with that girl anymore, understand? I'll play with her at school. You can't stop me. Hm. You know, when I was a little girl, I begged my parents for a dog, but they wouldn't give me one. SAM: Why not? Because my father was allergic. It would make him sneeze. But then my grandmother bought a dog, so I could go to her place, and play with it, instead. I don't have a grandma. Aww. Well, you do have a very nice dog, and he's gonna be just fine, so that's something to be happy about, isn't it? Yeah. Thank you for paying the bill. Oh, it's the least we could do. We're ready. Bye, Sam! See ya. He really is a gorgeous kid. Yeah, he is. Must be tough on your own. We manage. Listen, if you ever need anything, please... I don't want your charity. Oh, it wouldn't be. Please. I think what Belle means is it'd be nice to stay in touch. I don't think so. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) There goes our grandson. Well, he's not really 'ours ours'. Well, that's easy for you to say. You've already got one. I need to go for a walk. (SOMBRE MUSIC PLAYS) What's happening? The girl with the appendix. Was she all right? Yeah, she's OK, but she complained about me sending her home with appendicitis. Ryan, I'm so sorry. I hope you told Gerry it was my idea. No, but... I will tell him. Don't worry. I'm only a trainee, OK? I'm allowed to make those mistakes. You don't have to take the blame. I'll sort it out. No. The patient's OK. And I don't want you to tell him, because the other nurses - they look up to you. They'll be really disappointed. I don't know what's wrong with you today. Hey, Gemma. I'm not Gemma. I'm Lewis, at least till he gets here. And when will that be? Well, your guess is as good as mine. Didn't Dad say he'd be back by five? Yes, he did. You took the afternoon off work. I didn't expect to see you here. Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna hang at home, thinking about... Nothing. Er, give me a job. That's what we want to hear - big team player. Hey, that gig got me two pairs of shoes. Just set up some tables. That'd be great. Thanks. Did I miss something? Oh, he's just annoyed cos I took a Super K gig at Will's daughter's birthday. Ah. Partying with the enemy. It's ridiculous. I shouldn't even need Justin's bloody forgiveness. I don't understand what's the big deal. You did the gig. You've got the shoes. Yeah. Well, it's not like you and Will are gonna be best friends. We might. He kissed me. I didn't know Will liked boys. Oh, he does. This one, in particular. Ah. Well, good for you. The thing is last time I was single, I was in my 20s. There was no responsibility. I could jump into bed with anyone, and no-one got hurt. Now I've got two kids and three business partners. So five kids. There were no rules back then. Now I don't even know what the rules are. I don't know what to do. Well, just don't do anything, unless you want to. Do you ever wonder how we'd have ended up, if we'd stayed together? We would've torn each other apart. Probably. I will say this, though. The day I found out I was pregnant with Ned, I was really happy. So was I. Neither of us thought we were gonna make it. I don't blame you for giving up, Ned. I blame us. (CAR DOOR OPENS) (ENGINE SPLUTTERS) I do blame you for leaving on the lights. Recapping the questions in this round, name three runners who'd won Olympic gold medals in the men's 100m. Name three runners who won Olympic gold... Good enough to eat. Why are you here? I promised Justin I'd be here. I'm a man of my word. My address. What time do you finish? You're confident. Isn't it time that you stopped letting a guy like Justin tell you who you can hang out with? This has nothing to do with Justin. There's about a hundred reasons why you and I shouldn't be together. Name three. Well, firstly, I don't think I'm ready. I should go. No. You stay. I've got more reasons. I should disappear. My ex just got here. We had a really messy break-up. I'll, erm... I'll see you around, yeah? JUSTIN: .. Ashes series between Australia and England? You've got three minutes to review your answers, and bring 'em up, and put them in the box, thank you. You're not gonna make it, are you? We got a flat battery. Uh-huh. I've been trying to find somebody with jumper leads, but this place is a bloody ghost town. And where are you gonna stay tonight? Well, I don't know. There's one hotel in town that's booked out. Yeah. You know what? It's getting busy here, so I gotta go. How'd that go? Belle, I gotta get back. Maybe there's a bus we can catch. I'm not leaving this car out here, in the middle of nowhere. I'm sleeping in the car. You can do what you want. (TENSE MUSIC PLAYS) Oh! Was that yours? I'll buy you another one. Sorry. Ladies and gentlemen, if I can have your attention, I think it's time we got this party started, so how about three drinks for the price of one? (CHEERING) Whoo! Shit. Wait, wait, wait. Guys, sorry, sorry. The deal's off. Yeah, it was never on, OK? Sorry. What the hell do you think you're doing? We can't afford to give away free drinks. Relax. Everyone's having fun. All right, fun time's over, OK? Oh, muchas gracias, amigo. He is no fun. Well, I think we've all had enough fun for tonight. How about I drive you home? Oh, thank you. I'm fine. I'm gonna stay. Excuse me. Just let me through here, fellas. What is with her? I wonder if Dad made it back. You know what? And you listen to me. There are no rules in relationships. So, you just jump on Will when you get the chance. (DISTANT SIREN WAILS) (EMOTIONAL MUSIC PLAYS) (TURNS CAR ENGINE OFF) (STARTS CAR IGNITION) (ENGINE WHIRRS) Mate, thanks very much. Great. Appreciate it. At least one of us got some sleep last night. Oh. Oh. (BICYCLE BELL RINGS) Poppy, breakfast now, please! Here we go. Now promise you consult with me before taking on your sister as a role model, OK? Hey, do you want some toast? I was just making Poppy's bed. This was under it. Ms Looby's purse. The one she lost. How did it get there? Poppy is so sorry. But now that we know who the bad influence is, we can, you know, get her back on track, not that it's the older girl's fault, at all. We always try to teach Poppy personal responsibility, and she is very sorry, as am I and Mark. We're all sorry. This is yours, and I also bought you another one, in case you lose it again. I can't accept that. Of course. Oh, and... ..I also brought the stat dec for you - that little incident which we can all now put behind us. We have spoken to Poppy about this being completely unacceptable, and it will be an ongoing discussion. I'm suspending your daughter. LEWIS: How many apples does one woman need? I like apples. They're the best fruit. Oh, you'll be eating nothing but apples for a week, and water. You should try it sometime. Does wonders for your complexion. Just, erm, put them wherever. I'll sort them out. (SIGHS) That didn't turn out how I expected. Not all bad, I suppose. No. It wasn't all bad. Hmm. I'm sorry we didn't find our son. But it's his loss. He should be proud of you... ..wherever he is. (ACOUSTIC GUITAR PLAYS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) Wait. My... Belle, my chest. What? My chest! Oh, God. Belle. (GROANS) All right, stay there. Lewis, I'm getting someone. No. Belle, Belle. Lewis. Just... Let's get you in. Come on. Belle, you can't come in. What are you talking about? Just let me handle it. Lewis. Suspended. Yep, that was the word she used. ABI: OK. Let's not panic. We can fix this. OK. I'll see you at home. Bye. Abi, I think I'm having a heart attack. (WHISPERS BY PASSENGER PLAYS) ABI: We need some help here! SONG: # I should know by now # Well, I'll wait in line # So I can wait some more... # (RINGING) # Till I can't remember # What I came here for # But I can't leave now... # (MOBILE PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) # Cos I've a light that shines # And a love so pure # But I don't know what to use them for # I should know by now. # Although my own terms of traditional beliefs and old-fashioned values could not completely agree with this marriage, I must never judge on your prerogative.

From this day forward, your lives will be forever changed. Will you love and cherish each other until eternity? I will. No matter what the future brings.

Come on. That's okay. Nam. Yes? Do you really need to do that? Pim, it's empty already. This is not nice. You know it's not environmental-friendly at all. Let's dance. No! You are wasted. No! You really have no shame. Indeed. I haven't. Don't you think it's fun? You are soooo wasted! Pim. Wait up! Shitheads! What? Those stupid dump ass. They ruined my camera lens here. What about you? What are you doing here all alone? Isn't the Moon beautiful tonight? Yes, it is. Do you know a Japanese song called Kojo No Tsuki? Never. What about the song Duen Pen (Full Moon)? I know. It's my dad's favorite. Even we live on a different part of the world, the Japanese and the Thais, still we share a glimpse at the same side of the Moon. We write homesick songs. I read about Japanese samurais' war story. They said Japanese kills one another until there's no soul left. Nothing remains, but the tragic ruins... and the same old Moon. That's right. How did you know that? You just mentioned about Japanese and Thai similarity. So I figured it must be the Moon. Pim! I'm right here. Pim! I'm here. What's up? It's time to go. Hurry up. I have to go. Okay. Pim! I'm not deft. Wait up! Wait! Where is Pim? What did you do to her last night? I danced. Only dance? I hate to tell you this, But you looked like shit last night. Now I know why Pim is angry at me. Can you guys do me a favor? What? Can you help me make it up to her? It's a huge task. Please. I'll buy you something yummy. Help me. You know what Pim is like. And I know you know that we love... Freebies. Right. What is the matter now? Aren't you the cutest one of all? Stop it. Who is that? She kinda looks familiar. Forget about it. Pim. I want to talk about my scholarship in Japan. I know. You'll go for a few years. And I am here, waiting. Right. I just want you to apply for the same scholarship. If granted, then you can transfer all the credits and live in Japan. We both will be the coolest couple over there. It's not that simple. My parents need me here. Besides, I have just started college here a year ago. I'd rather stay here. You are all grown-up and hard to convince now. I ask you not to bring this topic up again. Promise? Alright, then. Blimey! What a surprise! Hello, Pat. Hello there. Fiat-Fe. How are you doing? I'm doing just fine. Where is Noni? He's inside. Is he? I'll go fetch him. Thank you. Noni. Pat is here for you. Fiat. Coffee is ready. Yes, sir. This smells so good. Here's your coffee. Alone today? Yes. Where's your beau? There's never any beau. If you say so. It's the norm here. We hardly see a solo traveler in Pai. Mostly lovebirds. They ride on the motorbike, taking selfies here and there. Hate them! Let them be, Noni. I think I am okay with being single. I see. I just love your place here. It's so happening. I wish I can own a place like this. Do you? Yes. You're serious? Yes, I am. If you are really serious, why don't you give it a try? How? Next month, I'll move to Germany to live with my boyfriend. I'll let you run this place. And I won't charge you a cent for it. You are kidding me. No, I'm not. All this. For free? Yes. And I'm giving you Fiat-Fe as well. Only if you double my wage. No problem. I hope you take it serious. I promise. Call me if you mean it. I will. I'll be right back. I think it's a brilliant idea. Pai is booming, really. There are hotels and cafes everywhere now. But our coffeeshop is the best. I know it. I couldn't agree more. If you really like it here, we can start off as a cafe. Then we expand our business into hotels. What do you think? Woww... Actually, I inherit a plot of land here from my grandfather. Do you? Yes. Alright. I'll show it to you. Okay. Nam. What's up? This movie looks really interesting. Do you wanna see it? Yes. The poster is beautiful. Let's ask them. Hello. Welcome to Film Cafe Hello. Hi. Movies or coffee, sir? Nam. Yes? I don't wanna see it anymore. Let's just go. Why now? I am enjoying it. I'll go then. Pim. Wait up! Dad. Hi, dad. Good evening, sir. Mom. I'm home. I'm in the kitchen. These foods look really good. Thanks to my wife. How have you been, Nam? I haven't seen you around lately. I got a lot on my plate now that I'm finishing college pretty soon. Pim said you are going to Japan for Master's degree? That's correct, sir. I applied for the scholarship. Did you get it? I did. I plan to leave Thailand right after I finish the college here. When exactly do you plan to tell me about Japan? Pretty soon. Your mom asked me that day, and I was being honest. That's all. What about me? How further will you keep me in the dark? I'm looking for the right moment. I guess I would be the last to know as usual. Pim. Pim. Collect your ticket and proceed to the club room on 4th floor. Manassaporn. Manassaporn. Here's your ticket. The club room. 4th floor. You coming? Wait up! Alright. I'll use the toilet quick. Manassaporn. Free Bird Club Where on earth is... Is this yours? Yes. I'm wondering where it is. Thank you very much. I'll help you with it. Thank you. Attention! Welcome everyone to Free Bird Club. Pat... Why do you join this student club? I don't really plan to. My friends talked me to it since the freshmen year. Now I'm stuck here. What about you? I guess I enjoy giving back to society. If there's anything I could do to help, I won't be hesitating. But you are in architecture? Actually, it's just one of my interests. Architecture is my chosen path. May be I'm just a girl who loves arts, simplicity and nature. What about you? My family runs a design company. So dad expects me to take over. Or I can design my own business adventure one day. Do you have one now? No. Not yet. Probably after college. It's all just in the plan. It sounds like a good plan. I know the owner. So she offered me to take over her cafe for free now that she's not here. It can be a good business. We should discuss it with her. How well do you know her? Are you sure she won't charge us later? She said she won't at our baby steps. But if it gets bigger, she promises a fair deal. Don't worry. I have known her for ages through my many photo trips in Pai. The trip you took my photo without permission? Talk about permission. It's you who happened to block my view. I didn't allow that. I didn't allow you to include me in that photo as well. Hello, Pat. Hi. Who is this? Hello. What is your decision about the cafe, Pat? Don't you see? I've brought my business partner with me today. Hello. Hello, there. Let's get inside, shall we? Yes. Well, how well both of you know about being a barista? None at all. Hey! Do you know where Pim is? No, I haven't. Okay, thanks. Hey! Have you seen Pim? No, I haven't. Where could she be? She shouldn't have turned off her cell. Nam. Where have you been? It's getting dark now. What are you doing here? Because it's getting dark. That's why I'm so worried about you. Where were you? I was in Pai with a friend. Which friend? A college friend. It's the student club activity. Do you have any idea how many times I tried to reach your cell? The signal reception in Pai is awful. What are you trying to accuse me of? I know for a fact that all college friends of yours are at the campus while you were in Pai. Who exactly have you been with? Tell me. I said it was a friend. A FRIEND. What do you want from me? Pim. Nam. Be honest with me. Okay? I'm tired. Please let go of me. No. Pim. We should talk it through. I have nothing to talk it through. I told you it was a friend. Just friend. Then who is that friend of yours? And what were you two in Pai for? Pim. Pim. Pim. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feeling. I was just too worried. Please don't get mad at me. How can I make it up to you? Pim. Pat. What are you reading? I'm reviewing my course curriculum. It's been only 3 years for you, right? I enrolled in every summer courses. That's why it's faster than others. Then, what is your future plan? I don't know it yet. Dad wants me to continue my study abroad. But I just don't feel like it. I need time alone with myself. To think. To travel. Here. I love Chiangmai. It's peaceful with mountains and big trees only a few minutes drive out of town. I'm so fed up with Bangkok traffic, pollution and skyscrapers. What about you? My place is here, so I guess I wouldn't be going anywhere far from my parents. Also the fast-moving city life doesn't really suit me. So I I need to talk. - And I need coffee. Can it wait? - Not really. - Perfect. You know, sometimes I feel like you don't listen to me. You know, something's got to be done about those two. I completely agree. But first, hey, we really need to talk. - Emma. - Hey. I didn't even hear you come home last night. Oh, I got in late, and I didn't want to wake you. - How'd it go while I was gone? - Uh, it went pretty well. Anyways, I'm really glad you're back. - Yeah, I'm glad... - Yeah, me too. Sorry. We just need to get this staff meeting started, so... - Oh. Okay. - Yeah. Yeah. Well, uh, I'll talk to you later. Yeah, absolutely. Bye, Emma. Okay, what was that about? She took the picture of you and Cinco and sold it to Snarkhampton. What? No. Yeah. She lied to us. Breaks my heart to say it, but she can't be trusted. And that's not everything. Guys, can we please get started? Yeah, unless there's anything urgent to discuss, I just need one more minute with Hank. So Ray... - A patient fired me yesterday. - What? W-wait. Why? I don't know. Women confuse me. Her name is Sloane Lerner. She's a model who can't keep any food down. Could she be bulimic? No, her vomiting is done very publicly. - Did you consider food poisoning? - Of course. - Celiac? - Yes. - Crohn's? - Obviously. - How about ulcerative... - Ulcerative colitis, yes. I considered all those things. Well, you can't give up on her. Why don't you both follow up with Sloane? Because, as I mentioned, she fired me. Right, but as Divya mentioned, since when do we give up on a patient? Maybe bringing in a set of fresh eyes and a female perspective will change things. I can't. I have to change Ray's bandages. I'll change his bandag... his bandages? What happened to Ray? Okay, this is what I've been trying to tell you. - He got shot. - Shot? Paige was there. He didn't want to call the police. Hanklab... done. Wait, wait, wait. Is Paige okay? - She's fine. - And what about Ray? He's fine too. Why would you not tell me all this? Because you had to get coffee. That's interesting. Tell me about that. I just can't get the shooting out of my mind. It feels like something's missing. There is. Closure. But if art therapy isn't working, there are other techniques... Support groups, drum circles, reverse birthing. No. No, this needs... Wait, what's reverse birthing? We use a pair of bean-bag chairs and an inflatable pool to simulate a return to the womb... Very healing. You know, I think I'll just go talk to Ray. And I think you are confusing emotional closure with closing the case. Yeah. Maybe I am, but I'm not gonna be satisfied unless I have a face-to-face conversation with him... The sooner the better. Well, between you and Evan, I don't know who is more impressive. Dr. Sacani, I was about to call you. - What's wrong? - Sloane's gotten worse. Sloane. Sloane. Sloane, this is my physician assistant, Divya Katdare. - Can you turn over for us? - No. Okay, what about extending your legs? She says it's too painful to stay straight. Her pulse is weak and thready, and she's running a fever. I need to check her stomach. Ow! Her abdomen is hard and distended. - Call 911. - On it. Call 911. Thank you. Patients with Wilkie's syndrome experience greater pain when faceup or to the right. Yesterday Sloane kept leaning to her left. So she could've developed an obstruction of the small intestine. We need to perform the Hayes maneuver. Sloane, let me move you onto your back. Let me move you. Good. And if you could extend your legs slightly. Hang in there, Sloane. This is gonna relieve the obstruction. Intense pressure now. Oh, my God. The pain... It's going away. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you. We need to get you to a hospital. Can we do this some other time? No, but we can make it quick. I keep thinking about the shooting, and something's off. There's a missing piece to the puzzle. Well, I've never been much of a puzzle guy. No, he likes other kinds of games. You have got some nerve showing up here. Paige Lawson, this is... Olivia Mazzarino, Ray's wife. Oh, hi. Ray must be so happy you're here. And, of course, this is not the housewarming he had in mind, but... I hope you like it. Nice to meet you, by the way. You want to talk about the house. Okay. Um, well, every detail was meant to reflect your lives together, from the screening room, inspired by your first date at the Oritani Movie Theater, to the amphorae outside, to remind you of your honeymoon in Greece. And you know your favorite Japanese place? We got one of those fancy toilets you like that clean you. For Ray, no detail was too big or too small, as long as it made you happy. Even the house itself... Stop. I've heard enough. You were telling the truth. You're not having an affair with her. With me? Of course not. I told you, Liv. I've changed. I take it back. It is nice to meet you. You shot him. What? That bruise. It's from a pistol kickback. I used to get them when my dad took me shooting. I go to a range sometimes. And I heard tires squealing but no engine noise because it was an electric car... The Tesla, your car, which you saw, but you didn't say anything... Because you were protecting her. Um... It's been a rocky stretch for us. I got to the Hamptons early, saw you in the bedroom, and assumed you were his new mistress. So I gave him a little warning shot to send a message. I just love him so much. I get jealous. Lucky for me, you're a good shot. The best. She comes from a long line of cops. That's how we met. He looks hot in handcuffs. I can't believe you got the toilet. Oh, hon, you're really sweaty. Ray? Are you all right? Oh, my God. Yeah, it smells sweet, and there are gas bubbles accumulating under the skin. It's gas gangrene. Call 911. How did he get gangrene? It was a minor injury. For Ray, there's no such thing as a minor injury. You can tell her. Your husband has a chronic liver condition called cholangitis. It can compromise his ability to heal, which means this infection could be life-threatening. You're sick. - An ambulance is on the way. - Good. This wound needs aggressive surgical debridement, or he could lose his arm. You have Wilkie's syndrome. Am I gonna live? It's a rare gastrovascular disorder characterized by compression of the third portion of the duodenum by the abdominal aorta, as well as the overlying mesenter... Yes, you're going to live. Every time you ate, your stomach was being squeezed as if it had a lap-band around it. You will need duodenal bypass surgery in the morning. But then you should have no more symptoms. Your career can get back on track, and you can eat whatever you want. As long as it's not clams. I'm sorry I didn't diagnose your condition sooner. I'm sorry I fired you. And I'm really grateful that you didn't give up on me. Not a lot of people are like that. More than you would think. Now you know why I didn't want the police involved. You were trying to protect your wife. I was trying to protect mine. That's why I wanted out of the business. Sorry it didn't work out. Me too. But I hope things work out with Olivia. I've been so busy trying to give her everything she wants, when all she really wants is to take care of me. Now she can. She's bringing dinner. You want fagioli? I do love fagioli. And thank you, but, no. Uh, no time. We've got to start looking for a new lab space and a new partner. Oh, you'll be fine, Passaic. You convinced me to go into business with you. That's not exactly how I remember it happening, but, uh... So how am I doing, doc? Well, they were able to remove all the necrotic tissue, and you'll make a full recovery, but you need to be more careful. Oh, I will. Olivia will make sure. Good. Any questions, don't hesitate to ask your next doctor. Next doctor? - What, are you firing me? - Don't worry. I'll make sure you're taken care of. But, yeah, I think it's best we part ways. Can't we at least discuss it? Ray, we just did. You hired the lawyer. Excuse me? The one that helped Viviana, you hired her, because you don't give up on people, even... when they're angry at you and kick you out of their house. I had to do something to make up for interfering. So I interfered some more. Well, I-I share the blame. I was being secretive. I should've just talked to you about needing more space... And less noise... And more sleep... And less baby things everywhere around the house. I didn't want to hurt your feelings. And... I-I should have talked to you about Viviana too. I was... I was afraid I'd feel embarrassed if things didn't work out with her... Which maybe they didn't. And I got so caught up in my own anxiety as a mother that I didn't see my need to protect had taken over. But you are stronger than I gave you credit for. Things won't ever be the same, will they? Well, things never stay the same. It's called entropy. Right. Right. But you and me... Are we... Hey, guys. What's up? I don't know, Emma. What is up? Uh, is everything okay? Emma, did you sell that photo of Cinco and me to Snarkhampton? uh... I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to hurt either one of you. I was so mad at Cinco, and so I sent that photo to some of the people who were at the party, and one of them must've sold it to Snarkhampton. And now everything is this huge mess, and I don't know how to fix it, and... Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Shh. You don't have to do anything on your own, not anymore. Yeah, we're family. We'll... we'll figure this out. Thank you both for everything. While we're here, though, just... Is there anything else we should know about? No. No. It's all good. Good. Okay, so I've got the Henderson twins' vaccinations at 10:00 and Ms. Newberg's annual physical at noon. Which, of course, will turn into a three-Martini lunch. For her, not for me. I've got back-to-back patients needing MRIs. You're lending me your Navy tie, Henry. No, I'm not. I love that tie. - And you won't return it. - Thank you. You know, sometimes I feel like you don't listen to me. - Yeah. - Yeah. Now with Hanklab gone, are we going to have to plead with the hospital for more reasonable rates? No, not yet. I'm actually working on Hanklab mach II. Really? Yeah. I don't want to jinx it by talking about it too much right now, but just wish me luck. - Good luck, Evan. - Hey. - I like your tie. - Oh, thanks. - It was a gift from Hank. - No, not. - Morning, everyone. - Morning. Good morning. Isn't Evan staying for the staff meeting? No, he's working on Hanklab mach II. Hey, guys, one of my prescription pads is missing. Did either one of you take it? - No. - Not me. Was anyone here while we were in Argentina? Not that I know of, just Emma. I'm home now and feeling much better. Thank you. It's good to see you again. You as well. I wanted you to know that my wife and I are looking into expanding the scope of our foundation to include orphan diseases. We hope to move quickly, and as soon as we have, we'll be in touch, yeah? Wonderful. It would be my privilege to make a contribution. I look forward to talking with you both. Take care, Tobias. And give our best to Jakob. Adios. Good morning, Boris. Mr. Lawson, to what do I owe the pleasure? Oh, this isn't a social visit. Certainly not, or I'd invite you to sit. I have a business proposal I want to discuss with you. It's one I think you're gonna find pretty interesting. By all means. Thank you. Goddess. Leaving, leaving, I am leaving. Leaving my family. Leaving my home. Now. It is for eternity. That I leave. Goddess. Goddess of Mercy. REVIVRE Yeah, dad. Mom passed away this morning. CHOI'S UROLOGY CLINIC I have prostatism... and my urinal condition is a bit... Lie down over there. Oh my, you've got one full tank. This is just a process of aging. Your symptoms are just a bit more severe. Help this patient urinate! It'll be a hefty amount. Yes, sir. You know the procedure, right? There'll be discomfort only during insertion. Relax. This'll take a while, so relax. Where are you, dad? Were you able to urinate? Yeah... I'm at a nearby clinic. You better inform your company and come to the hospital. Guest No. 35. Guest No. 35! Guest No. 35! You got a call! Bring it here, Bori. Bring it to me, Bori. Good boy. Bring it to me. Good boy. Good boy. Come here. You got 2 calls from Samcheong. You should call them back. Okay. Did you both have breakfast? Yeah, we had hot soup. You both are so careless. Did you think attaining a working visa is that easy? We had no clue. We thought 3 months would be it. Besides, we got an offer for the house, so we had to sell it. And what about your belongings? Are you planning to crash here for 3 months? Of course. Do you have a better idea then? We'll clean up the 2nd floor. You can stay there. Okay. About 130 kinds of tumors can break out on the human brain. We removed most of the tumor with the previous surgery. So this seems to be another outbreak and not a relapse. But why does it keep turning up on my wife? Like we cannot explain birth, the same goes for a tumor. I guess this calls for another surgery. So, the operation's tomorrow? What the hell is going on? Dr. KANG is the attending surgeon, so don't worry. Have a seat, auntie. Sis, are you in any pain? Don't worry, I'm okay. This all happened cause you're always saying that! - Ah... - Oh, I'm sorry... Dad, let's just ask the nurse to do it. What is it? Huh? Wait a sec. Are you okay? Huh? - Please give her some pain killers! - Just a moment. Mom, hang in there. You'll be fine after the surgery tomorrow. Ahhh, it hurts... Ah, my head hurts... Honey... my head is killing me! Do you have to tie her up like this? The patient will only suffer if the line's pulled out again. Good evening. Good evening. Her phlegm spitting went easy. She was good today. She can be discharged in 4 weeks, 2, the earliest. I guess you'll have to be with us a bit longer. Check her temperature every hour. And don't forget she has to take her medicine at 3 am. Then I'll be on my way. Wait! Can you press the 4th floor? I'll stop by with a veteran we recently hired. Uh! She's already here! Over here. Let me introduce you. Our new Marketing Deputy, CHOO Eunjoo. Our Executive Director Mr. OH Jeongseok. At your service, sir. Nice to meet you. The pleasure is mine, sir. Book a company dinner. It'll be her welcome party. Yes, sir. Check out your desk first, then we'll go for a company tour. Attention everyone! Filling in our Marketing Deputy position, let me introduce, Ms. CHOO Eunjoo. My name is CHOO Eunjoo. It's a pleasure to meet you. Welcome. She'll be handling broadcasting and consumer group contacts. She'll be the face of our company. As you may know, our company's face should be treated how? With seasonal pattern makeup! Bingo~. From now on, you'll be wearing our focus pattern make-up. Welcome to the company! - Hello. - Nice to meet you. Chief PARK, Chief JEONG, Deputy KIM, Soeyeong. Yes. NATIONAL FEMALE CONSUMERS' POWER ASSEMBLY Oh, I wasn't aware you were in a meeting! Don't worry. We're done here. Please come in, Mr OH! I just stopped by to say hello with our new Marketing Deputy. This is Ms. CHOO Eunjoo. Nice to meet you, I'm CHOO Eunjoo. Ah! Yes, please have a seat. Ah, yes! - Have a seat. - Yes. You're still pretty busy, aren't you? Like a true cosmetics company, quite a beauty there you hired. Anyway, welcome. The feminine wash in development has high cleansing effects. But residual drugs in the vagina, unexcretable through urination, sets in here and generates nasty smells. Which will mean a rise in production costs and complications in advertisement strategies. Do you think we'll be able to deal with that? Mr. OH, what do you think? Yes. Distribution management costs will also go up. Also, I believe that dividing vaginal acidity levels can offend the consumers. Single or married women, product identity positioning should be clear. Because a change in target group changes the launching strategy. CANCER TREATMENT CENTER Off we go, sir. You're here. The 'Hurrah To Housewives' radio show sponsorship I briefed you. And the Daehan News anniversary ad. I was planning to call you. Yes. Awe, come on... - Awe, Deputy KIM. - Get on the next one. Sir, you're buying us a drink when this is all over, right? Just get it done and it won't be just one drink. How about a trip out of the city for an all-night drink fest? It's been ages since we visited your Sohori villa. I wonder if that chicken stew place still tastes the same. Sir, you think we should make it happen? Why not? Wait. FUNERAL HALL. You're here. Hospital administration called us about the medical bill JEONG JINKYUNG Yeah, CHO. I sent the obituary to 3 morning, 2 evening papers. Regarding beauty-related press, agencies and businesses, I told your secretary's office to contact them. Okay. When your husband returns, go home with him. Since we won't be expecting guests until the evening. I want you to go through your mom's clothes and shoes. Get rid of things but send what's good to the welfare center. And feed the dog. Dad, why are you in such a rush? It's not like you can erase her by getting rid of things! Dad, you went through graduate school thanks to mom. Started out small but now own a lush house and a country villa! But what about mom? What's she left with? Mom... How could you leave Bori behind like this...? - We'll tend the registration, sir. - Thanks a lot. Yes, sir. It's hard losing a wife at your age. I knew it was coming. You've taken good care of your wife, I'm sure she'll have no regrets. It's you I'm worried of. I trust you with this company I'm sorry. This may sound insensitive, but the summer marketing strategy, we really need to wrap things up. Right. We narrowed down the concept. I'll get the report and make a decision. Thanks. I have an appointment today, so I'll drop by tomorrow. Yes. Good. See you tater then. OH, do take care of yourself. Okay. Go grab something to eat. Say hello to my colleague, Mr. AHN Sungtae... Miyoung, every time, I notice how you resemble your mother... We met at your wedding, right? Such a good-looking man. I'm so jealous. CHOO EUNJOO I heard you fell. I got my butt all wet. Want me to mix you a drink? Thanks Ms. CHOO. You're supposed to drink at a wake. That's being respectful! I know this isn't a good time, but 2 weeks ago, we shot 2 drafts: 'Go Light' versus 'Inner Journey' concept. We need your final decision to proceed with the summer ads. Our competitors are already gearing up for their ad shoots. The big boss won't let us start without your decision. OH Jeongseok. He should thank me for stepping up to Exec. Director. Yeah, he's one quick-witted guy. Real quick. Yeah, he worked hard, too. Anyway, I never beat him once. Such a tight-ass. Our concept is the transitional aspect of a woman. Every woman holds onto a desire for things that are different. Heavy makeup on Chief JEONG's model is overshadowing the moisturizing cream's functionality. If we can create a moist look quite successfully, this direction will definitely work. But natural-look ad concepts have been overly exploited and can feel redundant to consumers. Our woman is confident and sexy, even to her backside where she can't see, with healthy, elastic skin made possible by our moisturizing cream her thighs and calves are overly-muscled. We can do touch-ups on photo works, but for moving images, we'll have to do separate video work with parts models. Hey, OH! I'm leaving I'm coming' back tomorrow. Sleep if you get drowsy... Hey! A man's gotta get his sleep. A chief mourner's no superman. Ah, go get my shoes. Ah, they're here, here I'm leaving. Take care. Yeah. Did you find him? He's not in the lounge. Oh, really? Where did he go? We should say goodbye before leaving. Sir. There are only few guests left, so we'll be going now. Uh, yes. I really appreciate it. You too, Ms. CHOO... Thank you, sir. Good night then. - No need to see us out. - Take care. Can you cut these up into smaller pieces? It's okay. Just go back to your work. My husband doesn't like his shirts dry cleaned. It's a hassle, but please wash them in water and iron them. Yes, ma'am. You can look at it after you're done eating. If you can't take care of Bori, I'm taking him with me, okay? My Buddhist priest won't agree, but he'll just have to follow his master's fate. You've got the vet's number, right? When my time's up, I'm taking him with me, okay? Don't worry. I'll put him to sleep as soon as you're gone. Don't worry. Here's to a great future for Adeleide's new 'Waterbolic'! - Cheers! - Cheers! It's USD 300 million in sales! 300 million! At a rate like this in the Chinese market, We'd definitely be in the Guinness Book of Records! Chief PARK, is this the result of good business sales? Of course not! Who says it's sales? It's the Marketing Team's victory led by Mr. OH, right? Mister OH! Mister OH! Cheers! Great work, sir. By the way, did Mr. AHN really intercepted our bonuses? If that's true, it's not fair! Don't you agree, Mr. OH? Our Exec. Director is resting. Sir, can we order more drinks? And us, too! Sir, can we order some more drinks? Go ahead! Order away! We should spend all our team bonus. Wine, whisky, order away! Tequila! A bottle of 'Gigondas' please! Ah, wonderful. This wine has a rich and dignified flavor to it. It acquires full-bodied quality and smoothness with time. It may seem cold at first, but by rolling it about in your mouth, it becomes kinder. Let's go, let's all dance. Dance? Come on, let's dance. Sir, we're going for just one more round. - You're in charge now, CHO. - Yes sir! Sir. Here. Your wine gift for dancing well, I'm giving it back. It suits you more. - Have a safe trip. - Good night, sir. - Good night, sir! - Off you go! Mister, can you turn the cab? Let's go back to that club. I can't from here. I'll make a U-turn at the next intersection. Uh, CHO. I'm back at the club. Where are you? Okay, then. I'll just go home. SISTER-IN-LAW I'll be home soon, so you can go if you want. I'm hanging up. Mister, let's go back again. I'm so sorry. Are you kidding me? Concept A is green, concept B is blue. - The green... - Ah, Chairman KIM, hello. We're always grateful for your... Sorry? Uh... What do you mean? That really happened? My deepest apologies I'll have a word with her and have her apologize. Yes, once again, my apologies. Ms. CHOO, Mr. OH wants to see you immediately. Okay. You called for me, sir? Sit! Yes, sir. If the consumers are kings, you should know the consumer group heads are emperors! What were you thinking talking back to Chairman KIM like that? ! The consumer group was talking nonsense, sir. How could a bug possibly get into our cleansing cream? That's impossible in our high-tech automated system. - They're nothing but bullies... - I know! And the Chairman knows! They know a bug can't get into our product with our system! But since they registered a complaint, it's her duty to confirm this with us! But this is about how we respond to it! - But still, sir..! - Just listen! MS. CHOO! Sir! You have an urgent call from the hospital. I want you to go and apologize to her! Now! Her temperature is 38.5. - Uh, dad. - Yeah. How's she doing? She got antibiotics for the fever. We have to wait and see. Why are you here? I'm okay. What do you mean? Is the fever down? They just checked it was 38.5. But it can go up again. Thanks for hanging around. I'm here, so go home now. - Mom, I'll be back tomorrow. - Okay. See you. - CHO. What is it? What? - I'm leaving. The security guard told me. Ms. CHOO's still in your office. Call her and tell her to go home. Mr. CHO will go and apologize. I want you to take detailed photos of our production system and send them to the consumer group. It's not often we open our lab, but there were special orders from Mr OH to show you around. Thank you. Photographs will be restricted to this area. You are free to take photos from here. Make sure to look as natural as you can, okay? Okay. Thank you. This way please. Sir. Ms. CHOO, where are you? I'm at the factory. How about you, sir? I'm also at the factory. You're still here? I thought the board meeting ended this morning? I was waiting to leave with you. Where are you now? At the main exhibition zone. Okay, I'll be there in a minute. Good job, Ms. CHOO. I'm not sure you'll like this. You skipped lunch, didn't you? I got this at the factory store. It's pretty good. Thank you, sir. How did the photo shoot go? I think it went well. Yes, I heard from the Manager. He spoke well of you. That you're sharp and efficient. It's always nice to be commended by another team. Since we're a top spending team, we shouldn't forget other teams have a jaded view of us. I'll keep that in mind. Bring a well-edited version of today's shoot to me first. And then send it to Chairman KIM after my confirmation. Make sure you save the file in case you need it for another situation like this. I will. This is pretty good. Why don't you have some, sir? Dad! I brought you some snack. I feel bad. Should we leave some for mom? No, mom's fasting. You go ahead and eat. - Miyoung. - Yeah? Grab me a diaper from the cabinet. It's in the drawer. - Need any help, dad? - No, it's okay. Does this often happen to mom? Miyoung, go to the lounge. I don't believe this. - Okay, let's go in this direction. - Yes, sir. Yes, yes, I'll call you back later. Yes. Sir, it's my wedding invitation. I'm getting married. A bit sudden, isn't it? Something came up and my fiance had to rush things. Your fiance, what does he do? He's a researcher at an int'l pharmaceutical company. Are you planning to work after you have a child? Yes, of course. Ah, let's see, the 28th, the 4th week of Saturday... Oh, I'm booked for a business trip that day. Ah, I see... I was really hoping you could come. I'm really sorry. I know this isn't proper, but congratulations. Oh, you don't have to... Okay, then. Thank you. - Sir. - Huh? What's this? I'm getting married. - Married? - You're getting married? It's my wedding invitation. Let's congratulate Ms. CHOO for her wedding! No, Friday and Saturday. We're sponsoring a performance, right? I can stop by to say hello. I'll need to sleep over to meet with local sole agents. - Good morning. - Thank you for coming. How is she? Uh, she's not holding up so well. I'm so sorry when you must be busy... So you're back by 3 tomorrow? I'll be back before 3. I'll try to come as soon as possible. Just hire the care worker for another day. ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE SPONSORED BY ADELAIDE Ah, hello. Thank you for coming again when you already came to the Chuncheon performance. I enjoyed it so much I had to come back since I was in town. - This way. - Ah, yes. The dressing room's too crowded. They're still not done with makeup although it's been 2 hrs. Jeongeun! - Yes? - Come over here. Sir, this is HA Jeongeun, the lead dancer of this program. Say hello. His word can get you into a TV commercial for cosmetics. Nice to meet you, sir. I actually have a good complexion. I can tell. People like you can make us lose business. My friend works at Adelaide, CHOO Eunjoo. We trained at the same dancing studio in high school. I've begged the sales head for a markup raise for years, but he just won't listen. It would be great if you could give us a little leeway. A salary man like myself has no power. Awe, but I heard you'll be promoted to VP. Uh? Who said I'd be promoted to Vice President? The news is all over the place. Anyway, assuming your trip this time means a 5% markup raise for us, I'd like to make a toast to that. Now, cheers to a 5% markup raise, cheers! Cheers! Thank you, sir. We wanted to treat you to a full course service. I'm hurt. Consider it done. I haven't been feeling well and I'm tired. I'll be heading for the hotel. Hey, PARK! - Escort Mr. OH back to the hotel. - Got it! I'm really sorry. I'll put the car in the parking lot and leave the key at the counter. Yes? You're Mr. OH, right? Mr. CHO sent me here to give you a full course service. No thank you. How come? No need for that. But Mr. CHO told me to take good care of you. - I'm not your type? - That's not it. But... You'll tell him I was great, won't you? I will. But I shouldn't... SISTER-IN-LAW Hello? Uh, it's me. How's Jinkyung? She seems much better. Really? She seems to gets worse when I'm around. Anyway, I'm glad to hear she's feeling better. Jinkyung wants to talk to you. Okay. Hello? Where are you? I'm at a motel in Gimjae. Gimjae, Gimjae where? It's a motel at a large mud flat. I heard the flock of migratory birds used to be magnificent, but not anymore. I'll be back tomorrow, so don't worry. Yeah, okay. What was your dream about? Something on your mind? I'm just tired. How come you're awake? Where did you get this wine? You don't drink wine. An employee gave it to me. To drink instead of hard liquor. Really? Then pour me a glass. Come on, you're a patient. Just go to sleep. You want me dead, don't you? Say it... Okay? Say it... Say it. Are you planning to spend the entire night like this? Say it! No! Say it! It's cold. Good to see you. It must have been a long drive. I turned on the heat in case you might find the house humid. Yes, thank you. Uh, sir. Will there be people from your company visiting? No. Why do you ask? Then, I'd like to go home for like two months. I'll drop by to check each month. Don't worry, and just do what you have to do. No need for you to drop by. Okay. Then I'll see you later. Uh, wait. These are cosmetics. Give them to your wife. They're useless to me now. If you need more, I'll send them by post. Awe, you didn't have to. I appreciate it, ma'am. Take care. - Get some rest. - Thanks for everything. You're covered in dust, Bori. VIAGRA Does it hurt? No. Should I stop? No, it's okay. - Have you seen Ms.CHOO? - No, sir. She's not answering her phone. Has anyone seen Ms. CHOO? Where's Deputy CHOO? She's healing herself. Healing? She's been like that since she called off her wedding. She did it right in front of the guests when his ex showed up. So I don't get why she's acting like that. I should return what you gave me last time I'm so sorry for causing such inconvenience. Even if the Wedding's been called off... I already gave it to you. No need to return it. But it doesn't feel right. Don't pay any attention to what people say. Calling off a wedding is not a crime. Sir, I'm sorry but I've applied for the 'Linkay' China branch. How come? Is it hard for you to be here? It's not that. I just want a fresh new start. Their conditions are reasonable. Nothing's been set yet, but I wanted to ask for your advice. I heard Linkay's domestic setbacks are pushing them towards the Chinese market. Since you speak Chinese, I guess it'll give you a chance to be more aggressive. But we'll be losing an excellent employee. You're too generous when in fact I'm always messing up! Nothing's been confirmed on their side. I have to be interviewed. And their demand for experienced people has me facing competition. Do you need a recommendation from me? - Would that help? - Oh no! I already feel bad about quitting, I couldn't possibly... Really, it's okay I can handle it. They said they'll contact me... So I'll be receiving notice soon. What? You should answer it. It's okay. He keeps calling me after a few drinks. I really should leave this country soon. Letter of Recommendation. Recommender: OH Jeongseok Marketing Executive Director. Recommendee: CHOO Eunjoo Marketing Deputy. I hereby recommend the above exemplary person... Have a lot of work to do? Uh? Yeah. Something urgent came up. Did I wake you? Not at all. Go on with your work. So I can watch. I'm awake now. Could you play the Buddhist chant for me? Uh, okay. SONG, how did you find out? I almost missed the chance to pay my last respects. Sorry, I wasn't intending to contact many people. I was about to leave anyway. So, how are things going? So, so. I'm heading the Chinese market and it's breaking my back. You sent someone over to us. What's her name? - CHOO... - Yeah, it's what she wanted. I'm sure she'll be of great help. I don't doubt that with your recommendation. The one who landed the market's top hit of the year. And what a looker she is! The door is closing. A smiling face... isn't good for a portrait scroll. Cause she looks so full of life. It doesn't feel like she's gone. Get your surgery after the funeral. You should be healthy, Dad. Okay. Was mom in a lot of pain this morning? No. She looked peaceful. I wasn't even aware she passed. I thought she was asleep. After all the pain she went through for so long. When was it worst for you, dad? Huh? I mean, while you were taking care of mom. Nonsense. It's the sick who suffers the most. Dad... Have you ever loved mom? You never fancied her that much. Take off your underwear. No... no. Let the care worker do it. No. But you smell... Let me. No. Now, bend over a bit. My head hurts. It hurts... Lean on me. Go down a bit more. Lean on me. You got some on the front, right? I'll do it Here. Now, stand up. - Honey. - Yeah? I'm leaking again I'm sorry. It's okay. - I'm sorry, honey. - It's okay. I'm sorry, honey. Now we will be taking her to the casketing room. Oh, Jinkyung, my sister... Mom, mom... Jinkyung... Family members of the deceased may now pay their last respects. I got the job, sir. Thanks to your recommendation. Can I C U before I leave For China? Who's it from? It's nothing. It's just from a friend. Our crematorium is equipped with high-tech facilities that are free of smoke and pollution. NAME OF DECEASED JEONG JINKYUNG, IN PROGRESS CREMATION TIME: 10200-11234 Use land wisely? This is not about a lush funeral. Cremation's just too cruel! This is like killing her twice! Cremation rate now in the metro area is more than 80%. What kind of funeral did you have for grandfather? It was a lavish funeral with a bier flowing with 30 ode streamers and singers. It was the talk of the town. Goddess. Leaving. Goddess. Leaving, leaving, I am leaving. Leaving my family. Leaving my home. Now. It is for eternity. That I leave. Goddess. Goddess of Mercy. You must have been through a lot, sir. You did a good job cleaning up. Well, they're your wife's stuff. She called right before she passed away. Telling me to get rid of all her things. But I just couldn't do that with the photos. She asked you to get rid of her things? Yes. Saying, "You have to go when your time's up". And that I should get rid of everything. Where did this parcel box come from? I don't really know. Ah... I think it might be from your wife. She always used this company to send us cosmetics and things. - Then I'll be off, sir. - Yes, thank you. Gigondas. I got the job, sir. All thanks to you. I'd like to C U before I leave for China.

I'm in no position to raise him. And there's no one to feed him. You want me to arrange an adoption? What's his name? Bori, it's Bori. Like in 'ssal (rice)' and 'bori (barley)'? My wife named him after 'Bodhi' so he'd be born again as a human. Yeah CHO, it's me. We don't have time to fight over this. Let's just go with the 'Go Light' concept. The 'Inner Journey' is just too hazy. I'll report this to the boss. Green-light the budget and start working from tomorrow. - "I saw a beast coming out of the sea."

You act tough, but you just want to fall in love. You have a funny nose. - What does that mean? - Mm, I don't know. It's like a weird shape. Our babies would have funny noses. Have you thought about what I told you? About my uncle? - I just have to play some lame game with him, right? - Yeah. - Are you gonna come with me? - I can take you there, but you have to play the game by yourself. Those are the rules. - Okay. J"J" J"J" - HEY- One sec. Hey, Mike. This is the girl I told you about. She's on vacation. I think... - Did she say... - No, she doesn't know anything.

That's it. - He's not a pervert, right? - You'd like that. - Yeah, I don't-l don't know. - It's $500. You said you don't think it's real, right'? Remember what you said to me last night? Say it again. - I love you. - Put your hand in there and pick one. Go ahead. Three times to see if you're special. - Right. - Choose one. - Nice. J"J" - Last time. J"J" J"J" He's chosen you. Don't touch. Now, I'll give you this if you go down to where the roads meet and say your name. - Why? - So he knows your name when he calls for you. See, you're the vessel that breaks ground for the left-hand path. And one day, he will come. You'll be perfect. J"J" - Yeah. Yeah. No, he has these cute little freckles. Adorable, and his hair is exactly- his hair is exactly what you would expect someone from California to have for hair. Lori, I swear I didn't sleep with him, but I still want him to be my first.

I know I can get you a great price on your house, even with all the bad news out there. So let me tell you a little bit about who I am. I've been an agent for five years. I love putting people in homes because it offers families an opportunity for something better. I work every day, evenings too. - That's great. That's perfect, just-just exactly what we're looking for. Um, we-we do want to sell this house, um, and I think, uh, Leigh- I think you're the person to do it, and I think you'll be great. Uh, we do want to get it on the market as soon as possible, by the end of the week, if you could do it. - Of this week. Um... I'll try. - Okay- Uh, there's something else I-I suppose we should talk about. It's a little difficult, but we've been negligent on the mortgage the last few months. It's just really been hard. I got laid off. We have to sell it. You know, one day we're gonna get back on our feet, and we'll probably buy another house, maybe even buy it from you. - I mean, let's get your home sold. - There is some furniture in there. Are you gonna remove it? - No. When we bought the house back in, uh-'89? - '88. - '88. - Yeah. - That furniture was in there, and we don't need it anymore, so we'll-we'll just leave it. - Okay- And, uh, I saw there was a fire. - Yes, there was a fire. That happened one night while we were out. Uh, but it-really no damage. Uh, mostly cosmetic. - Yeah. One of my jobs is listing disclosures, anything that's wrong with the house, anything that can raise a flag to buyers. - I understand. Uh, so everything's fine. We'll get you a list of disclosures. I mean, we love this house. We-we didn't want to have to sell it. We raised our daughter there. - I think she stopped by this morning. - Charlene? Petite, short hair- - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - You saw her? - Yeah. Our daughter ran off with a boyfriend a couple months ago. - Oh. - So you saw her at the house. What was she doing there? - Um, I don't know. She came in when I was there, and she ran off when I tried to talk to her. - Yeah. Uh, you know what? I'm sorry to have to do this. L-I think we've got to talk to the police. We've been looking for her. - I understand. - You know, she's a great kid, and then just- something happened. - Yeah. Yeah. L'm-l'm so sorry. I'll schedule an inspection with your permission. - Absolutely. Let's do that as soon as possible, okay? We'll get you those disclosures tomorrow. - Good luck. - Thank you. - Bye.

I think I'm gonna be late tonight. - It's fine. - I'm stuck in this inspection. But as soon as it's done, I'm gonna be right over, okay? - Okay. It's totally fine. - I know it's fine, but it's your night. It's your opening, so I just- I don't know. I just want to be there. - Look, it really doesn't matter, okay? The show's gonna stay up, and this is a pretty lame party. - Well, at least... did that boy show up? - Stop. - What? He seemed so nice. - No, no, no. I know where this is going. - Don't make believe you're not looking for someone. - No, I'm not, Leigh. For the hundredth time, I'm not like you. I'm never gonna get married, and I'm never gonna have a perfect little house, and I'm never gonna have perfect little kids, all right? - Right. You're never gonna have kids. Well, who's going to, then? I didn't mean it like that. - Not me. Not my own. - Leigh, did you see another doctor? - No, I just... I'm sorry. Look, I'm- I know I'm a little crazy. I just...

Really? Look, you know, I-l just- I think of you up there in that loft all alone, and... I don't know. I thought you might want some company. We all need a little company sometimes. Right? - No. I don't. - Vera... it's looking for a home. Hello? Yes. I'm her sister. J"J" - Your sister's heart simply stopped. There are many possible reasons- hypertension, unexpected stress. Could've been genetic. - She was 29. - There's no signs of, uh, malice or foul play. There was no evidence of a struggle or that anyone else was there. She died of heart failure. You're the only kin, right? I'm gonna give you the address of the impound yard where you can find her car. J"J" J"J" J"J" Hey. It's me. Look, I was thinking. I feel bad about fighting. And I know that family is important to you, and sometimes I don't say, "I love you,' back, so... I love you. Okay. I'll see you. - Vera, I'm so sorry I've been so held up here. I'm still in Greenville. There's a girl who I think has been living here. She's with me. There's something wrong with her. I-I'll tell you more later. I love you. - Hello? J"J" - Come to me. _ He'! - Hey, wait! Hey! J"J" My sister thought she saw you in that house. - I haven't been there in months. - I talked to your parents, and they told me that you asked to be put in here. - Yeah. It's safer. - What are you scared of? - That house... The girl in the red raincoat. - I want to know everything you know about her. - When I was about 13 or 14, I'm sure I saw her, and... I was playing in my backyard, and I looked through a window into my parents' room, and I saw that girl standing there. But I went in there, and no one was there. - So all you ever saw was this girl in the raincoat? - Well, like a year ago, I switched rooms with my parents because I-l said I liked the view of the backyard, but really, it was just so that my boyfriend, Gus, could sneak in through the window at night. One night, we were... Doing it. And, um, I looked up, and there was somebody standing there in the mirror, watching us. ' The girl? - No. No. It was a man. I mean, he was just standing over us, and he was- he was all dark. After that, I had to get out of there. - Your parents told Leigh that you lit the fire in the house. She had that in her notes. - I didn't light that fire. - Who did? Well, ever since I touched the burned wall in your house, this won't wash off. - You know how you might find out what's happening? Go find the girl next to her, her friend. - I remember that article because of that photo. My dad took it. So you said you saw her? - Yeah. - It was a tragedy, what happened to Hannah. She had a good heart. If she had lived, she would've had kids and lived in the suburbs, despite all her acting out back then. We were good friends. I miss her. - What about her suicide? What happened? - After I saw what happened with Hannah, it opened my eyes that there are bad things in this world. There was a boy. And she met him when she went out to visit California. I want to be with you forever. J"J" - She told me this boy had talked her into selling her soul. - I want you to go down to where the roads meet and say your name so he knows your name when he calls for you. Hannah. J"J" - After she came back home, she said someone was coming for her and that when she looked in the mirror, sometimes she would see him... And... That he could get inside her. And she said to me, "He wants to be all of someone." I will never forget that. - Did you believe her? - Did you know she was pregnant? That's why her parents thought that she killed herself. They found a pregnancy test and thought she panicked and went crazy because of it. But Hannah told me something she never told anybody else. She told me she was a virgin. I think Hannah killed herself before whatever was happening to her had a chance to finish what it was doing, and I think that whatever you saw or maybe your sister saw wasn't her. I think it was whatever had gotten inside of her, and I think it was wearing her like a costume. - He wants to be all of someone? What does that mean? - Maybe the best thing you can do is get as far away from this as possible. - Mom, I'm done! - Do you want to wait? - No. Thank you. L'm-l'm gonna go. Thank you, though. - Hi, honey. Did you get all clean in there? - Yeah. - Oh. Hi. - I was lost, and there was a princess, and there were... J"J" J"J" _ - Vera... Yet the seed can go far below the ground and dies. If this happens, no fruit. Mario Diodato, born in Naples February 2, 1973. I am a servant of the altar, I help the church, the Eucharist.

Jesus said, "no respect thieves and murderers " "Neither powerful men who are his accomplices. " The chief said: "Who thinks it is?" Jesus said: "I am a man this closeness of spirit. " Our Father which art in heaven ... Pianese Nunzio, born Naples May 12, 1982. Soon I will have 14 years. Second step: Street Vita. Jesus receives the cross. Christ we adore thee bless. Jesus is nailed to the cross, all mourn in silence. No one imagined that a rite was getting scary. An innocent was convicted. I went to the parish at the time of monks there and ate with them. They were and came Father Lorenzo. The knew from a nearby parish. I also ate with him. I often go to church ... I am the pianist. Fourth step: Rue St. Vincenzo. Jesus meets his mother. Father Lorenzo gave me quarter to study, rest and sleep. I keep my stuff there: Books, notebooks and pencils. I want to add a seminar and be a priest. Come up, drink up and do not have to look for a job. Jesus is nailed to the cross. His sentence was written on the cross: Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. It was not written in our language. Two crosses, two thieves and Jesus in the middle. Who goes with thieves, we know that becomes crippled and thief. After three or four weeks, Father Lorenzo approached me. I said I had great affection. Hugged me, kissed me. We did the duties in his room. Someone comes up he sent him take a hike. Twelfth step The Church of Fontanelle. Jesus dies. Jesus said: "Father, forgive them ..." "They know not what they do." The chief laughed between his teeth. Night fell in the neighborhood of Sanita. He said: "Father, why forsaken me? "and died. Then he started touching me. He took my hand and I said to touch him. I had to play the His ... and he, mine. He said so we showed our affection. Fourteenth Step: Fontanelle Cemetery Jesus is exposed in the tomb. I do not deny. I was glad he shows his affection. Also ... because sometimes I I was a little sad. In the name of the Father Son and Holy Spirit. Lorenzo Borrelli, born in Piacenza, on April 8 1960, to unknown parents. What day is today? Aware of the responsibility moral and legal I take my statement. I'll tell the whole truth ... and not conceal anything, by my conscience. Hey, Ben, what are you watching there? It's a special on, uh... On paranormal experiences. You know, how does a baby bend a spoon, I mean, with its mind? Is this a riddle? It's part of the show. There was a baby that bent a spoon with its own mind. Jeez, kids today. You know, when I was a kid, we had to bend spoons with our hands. Well, if you don't mind, I'm going to get back to the show now 'cause, you know, I just set aside. Some time to watch TV every day, dad, and I don't need that interrupted. Well, maybe you do too much of this TV stuff. Well, not necessarily. I limit myself. I don't go too far with it. You know, I stop when it's done. Hey, Ben, you'll never guess who I got a postcard from today. Becky Freeman? Wow, Ben, Becky Freeman is right. Did she really send one? Yes, she moved back to the city, and in fact... Oh, my god, dad, that's so bizarre. That's, uh... Well, I knew she was going to move back... No, no, no! That's paranormal, what I did. It's paranormal activity. I think what you've experienced is what they... What scientists call a lucky guess. You don't believe... You don't believe in ESP? No. You don't? Nope. Do you believe in electricity? Yes. Okay, that's a start. But, you know, what I believe in. Is how susceptible you are. To anything you see on television. Dad... Remember when, four years ago, you thought you were a solid gold dancer? Do you remember that, hmm? Right, but I wasn't one officially. You get sucked into the screen. You forget where you end and the TV begins. No, but, I mean, the guess, it had... It had something else. I felt it. There was a power, dad. Well, maybe... maybe we should have her for... Dinner! Holy cow, now that... Dinner. Absolutely. Do you realize what just happened here? You guessed correctly. I asked you who was coming... No, no. First of all, dad, how many people are there in the world today? Two, three million? Actually, Ben, it's in the billions. Well, you asked me, "Guess who sent me a postcard?" And out of all the people in the world, I said Becky Freeman. Ben, how many people do you actually know in the world? - Eight? - Nine. It's not like I would be getting a postcard from a total stranger. You had a lucky guess. Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad... Dad, it's ESP. Admit it. You know, this thing is bigger than the both of us. Good night, Ben. You can't go to sleep now. It's obvious that I've got some powers, you know? ESP? Mm-hmm. You name it, I got it. I'm a walking guy. With all kinds of powers, you know. Yeah. Maybe I should sleep in a coffin or something. Because this is starting to get a little scary. What's going on here? Am I levitating, dad? Did you sleep in your clothes last night? These are the same clothes you had... Dad, think of an animal from one to 10. What? I mean, just think of an animal. Oh, you... Have you been up all night with this ESP crap? Dad, please don't muck it up with conversation. Just think of an animal. No, I don't want to think of an animal, to tell you the truth. Okay, think of a vegetable then. Okay. No, seriously. Do me a favor. Okay. Come here. I need to touch your head. Oh, boy, do I hate this. I hate this game so much, Ben, you know. This is... You need human contact. You need to get out of the house. You need to get a job. No, I need to get a sensation. I mean, I feel your energy. You're right here, but I need you closer. I need to touch... Okay, look, if it'll get you out of this room. And to the breakfast table, I will think of an animal. Clear your head of everything else. Okay, I'm thinking of an animal. Let the vision of the animal settle in your mind. Let it settle up near the front, so I can see it. Is it a camel? No. It's not a camel? Is it a moose? It's not a camel, it's not a moose. Is it a camel again? Ben, this is ridiculous. You know what? You're up against a guy. Who's not willing to think of an animal is your problem. You know, maybe I'm not concentrating. Maybe you're throwing me off. Are you thinking of several animals at the same time, hmm? 'Cause you only gotta think of one. Let me... I'm going to get you. Some kind of sedative or something. 'Cause you need to get some sleep. Okay, fine. Is it a hamster? 'Cause a hamster's like a small camel. No. Damn it. All righty. Hello, doctor. Hi, Ray. You know, my... I have a few phobias. That have perked up since the last time. Yeah. I have a spider phobia, you know. Is that common? Not unusual. Yeah. I had a bad experience in my car. Right. It was kind of like right out of a horror flick, you know. I was, uh... I was driving on the highway, and I saw this spider on my windshield. And then I thought, "Okay, you know what? I'll turn the wipers on, and that'll kill him." So then I turn the wipers on, and it goes right over him. And then it dawned on me, he's in the car! It's just like that horror movie. "We've traced the spider. He's coming from the inside!" That's over now, Ray. You're safe, you know. Ohh! I feel a little better. What other phobias are you talking about? Um, the usual. Yeah. The other stuff is normal. You know, death, taxes... Uh-huh. Cloud cover, certain crayons, colorforms, raisins. Well, you ever watch two men go to the movies together? Yeah. They never want to sit right next to each other, not if possible. There's always that empty "I'm a heterosexual" empty seat right there. Yeah. "Here is my friend, my heterosexual friend. Hey! Headlock!" Hey, Laura. Hi. I noticed you came a little late again today? Yeah. I would, uh... I would appreciate it. If you could make an effort to be here. At 9:00 sharp. Is that... Mmm... that might actually be a problem. How so? Um, because I usually don't get here until after that. Yeah. I've told you about my other experiences with therapy. This last guy I went to would not shut up. You know, I'd go in, I'd sit down, and he'd go, "Hey, Tom." What do you want to talk about?" And I'd go, "I don't know. I guess childhood." He'd go, "Childhood?" You want to hear about a crappy childhood?" And he'd just go on and on and on. And I was like, "Sorry I brought it up." Yeah, you shouldn't have to listen to that. But I do like my new apartment. Um, the couple that lives right next door is maybe a little too friendly. They keep asking me to do things I really don't want to do with them. Yeah. And the other day, they invited me over to this dinner party that they were having, and there was no way of getting out of it. So about 10 minutes after I got to the party, um, I pretended to have a stroke. Uh-huh. Yeah. I don't know if you've tried this, but let me tell you, once you commit to something like that, man, is that a hard one to back out off. I didn't know what to do, so I just kept lying there on the floor just trying to work the one side only. When I heard them phone in for an ambulance, I thought, "This one has gotten away from me." Right. So I didn't know what to do. I just thought I'd better come clean, so I popped up, and I was like, "I was just joking." And they did not seem to find the humor in that at all. But everything's expensive these days. I should know, too, 'cause, last year, I made over $8,500. Really? I got nothing to show for it. Now, where does the money go? How much do I got to make to be on easy street, is the question I pose. Hmm. But one thing is, I try not to be too materialistic. Because, you know, you can't take it with you. Right. Well, that's what they say, but what if you can take it with you? What if I die, I get to the pearly gates, and Saint Peter's like, "Hey, Tom, how's it goin'? Hey, where's your stuff?" Oh, man, this is going to suck." - Hey, Laura. - Hi. How are you feeling? Pretty good. Because I'm getting a bad energy... - Oh, no. - From you. You know, I have developed an understanding beyond our realm. Hmm, so I've heard. I have a kind of a power... It's a sixth sense, a second sight... That all begins with "s." Hmm. Hey, is the, uh... Is the, uh, the little big guy busy? Busy? I don't think so. You know, you're probably wondering what this is all about. No. Let me fill you in. You see, I've got ESP, extra sentencing something else? The thing... Extrasensory perception. Perception, right, yeah. So I've got that. Right. You know, I'm kind of new at it, and, uh, I just got my powers last night. Wow, that's great. I know, I've been reading people's minds all day. Man, I am beat. Can you read my mind? Do you know how many people have asked me that today, Laura? Like I'm some kind of freak, huh? Like I'm some kind of sideshow act, hmm? Ben, have you even seen any other people today? Couple. Who? A guy. You're really psychic, huh? Well, I mean it's undeveloped, you know, as of yet, but I do have the... Okay, you want to give it a try? Yeah, but I'm going to have to touch you. Uh, no. Okay, I can do it without. Okay. It's just not as good. I'm happy that I quit smoking cigarettes, and I was rationalizing it quite a bit. I, uh... I started telling people that smoking was just a hobby, you know. Some people collect stamps, I'd smoke cigarettes. Yeah. But then I started to realize there were some holes in that theory. I don't think there's too many stamp collectors that wake up first thing in the morning and go, "Where are those damn stamps? I got to lick one right now." Right. "Just a little lick to get me going." But you seem like you're in good shape. I guess my physical health is okay. I think I'm turning into a hypochondriac. I hope so. Otherwise, I'm just about to die. Hello. - Hey, dad. - Hi, Ben. How are you doing? You busy? Uh, yeah. You got a second? One second... I mean, I know you do. Okay. 'Cause I predicted you did. You have time. You're at a lull now. Look, Ben, what do you want? Come on. Dad, one serious moment with you, if I could. Yes. Think of a number. Okay. Okay? You got it? I got it. All right, keep it to yourself. Okay. All right, I got to go. No, I was just kidding. Actually, the number is 49, right? Well, Ben, you're cheating. That's my age. I always think of my age all day. Well, why don't you think of another number then? This has really gone too far, you know. It was cute last night. You got the card right. You had a couple of lucky guesses, but you're getting way ahead of yourself. Those aren't lucky. I mean, look, three times is not a coincidence anymore. Yeah. All right? You know, after two times that I've been right, it's not a guess. Hey, you know, dad, you may have it too. You might have the second sight. I mean, if I have it, you might have it. You think you might have gotten it from me? Or vice versa. You know, a friend of my father was a mentalist. Oh, really? Yeah. And he just... You know, he did if for years, then he quit one day. He said to my dad, "It's just so hard to tell what people are thinking." - Really? - Yup. So it's not a power? It's a... It's a gimmick. I don't think... I'm not saying what you do is a gimmick... Do you think these kind of powers are just based on a gimmick? They're all fake? Pretty much. Look, that's fine. I understand your point. And all I ask is for you to stay away from the bar today. Because I have a bad feeling about the bar and you. You're wearing me down, Ben. You really are. Just don't go to the bar. Okay, I won't go to the bar today, but what exactly would happen to me. If I did go to the bar? Just to play along with you. I don't have a clear picture of that. Yeah. But something is wrong. What are you seeing even roughly? What kind of images come into your mind. When you see me at the bar? Bottles. Yeah. Um, tables. Yup. Well, you're waling now. Slow down. You're going to hurt yourself. Oh, I'm good. I'm so tired. I had to go to an Italian wedding yesterday. Oh, man, I'm telling you, if I have to chicken dance ever again, I'll kill somebody. That's the worst, the chicken dance, or the... Even worse than that. Is the train you get sucked into. That human idiot train. Right. I'm always in it involuntarily. Always, "No, I'm going to the men's room", I'll see you guys in one second. Yeah, hey, what's up? Oh, shoot!" And you're stuck. You can't get off. That's the thing about the train. You can't just... You can't just jump off. 'Cause then you're the conductor. For whoever is attached to you. "I'm going to the men's room." They'll follow you. They'll follow you right into the men's room. "Hey, where are we going? What's he doing?" I want to stop talking about my kids, though, 'cause people brag about them too much. And I... There's nothing more... You know, a friend of mine. Had a kid the same time, and it's like... It's a battle of whose kid is advancing more, you know? Yeah. "Oh, mine rolled over at three months." Every time I'd see him. I don't want to brag, but my kid, three months, rolls over... Mm-hmm. Push-ups. Starts doing little push-ups. Wow. And the one's where you clap in the middle. And I'm like, you know, I don't want to rub it in his face. I just hope my twins adapt well, you know what I mean? They're only a few minutes apart, especially for the younger one. Yeah. Oh, what's that like, having an older brother. A few minutes older than you? Got to be so frustrating. I mean, I had a brother a year older than me, and that was hard enough, especially when you're a teenager, and you're, you know, you're trying to get the same privileges. Right. "Oh, dad, can I borrow the car? You always give it to Matthew." "Hey, look, young man, when you're Matthew's age." "Hold on, all right, now you can have it. Too late, he took it three minutes ago. You're always missing it." Mmm. They're exactly identical, that's what baffles me... That soft spot on the head? Yeah. You know the part. Where the head goes in on the newborn? Right. Exactly. Exactly in the same spot. But you always got to check, by the way. Always make that... Make sure that little spot goes in. 'Cause, correct me if I'm wrong, if it doesn't... If it comes out, that means they've been tampered with. Somebody tried to unscrew your baby's head. Do you believe in the supernatural? I believe in that stuff. I actually met my first wife at a seance. Really? Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a regular, and she was a medium, and, um... I got you, Stanley. Julie, what do you think? Do you believe in that stuff? Because Ben is convinced that he has these supernatural powers. Really? Yeah. What is it that Ben is thinking, and what happened? See, Ben thought something awful would happen to me, I would be injured in a way that was humiliating. Where and when? Why? You want to be there? Yeah. Was it supposed to happen to you today? - Yup. - Like when? Like now? In fact, he told me to stay out of the bar. Did he say anything about people around you? Were they in danger at all, or... No. 'Cause there's another table over there I could take. Come on, Stanley, I need you to be strong for me now. There's another table over there I could take. That's much better. Ben. Ben, I'm home. Geez, dad, you scared the hell out of me. Ben, what are you doing? I figured I'd start out with the plastic utensils first. A little easier on my mind. Wait a second, you bent all these spoons with your mind? Well, pretty much. You know, I found that if I preheat them first, makes the job a whole lot easier. Ben, I am... Ben, I can't believe you still think you have special powers. I mean, here I am. I mean, remember your prediction. About getting injured, and... Mm-hmm. Well, take a good look at your father. Nothing happened, I'm fine. I'll tell you, though, you may be right, and I agree, I could have been wrong. Well, I'm sorry if I came on too strong because... No, but even in... You know, even in the world of the paranormal, which... Yeah. You know, I live in and you don't, there are mistakes made. I'd love to yank you out of that world. Dad, I'm here for good. Can we move... Drop the subject? Let's make up and have another glass of seltzer, huh? What do you say? I think that's in order. You pour. Oh, gee, Ben! What are you doing here? Look at you. Do you look silly. God, these are my best... That sel... You know, seltzer will take out seltzer. Oh, that's right. Yeah, if you get a seltzer stain... Oh, I get it, so this is the injury you predicted. Well, I mean, it was something like that, you know. I didn't say it was going to be serious. Well, what got injured here? That's what I don't get. How about your pride? I'm just checking. Think about it. Yep, you know what, you're right. Get back to me. And how is it going between you and your father? We're getting along a lot better. Than when I was in high school. We didn't get along back then, but looking back, I guess we didn't have a lot in common. I knew nothing of medicine, and he didn't smoke pot. Yeah. So I usually just tried to stay away from him. I'd go in my room and watch TV. So in those days, it was an awkward relationship. Uh, we were friendly, but we were more like casual acquaintances, polite strangers at best. I'd run into him every once in a while by accident, you know, like, "Oh, no, there's dad. And, man, am I high right now." Mm-hmm. "What the hell do I say to this guy? I don't even know him that well. Oh, here it goes, he saw me." "Hey, dad. Hey, uh, didn't I see you in the kitchen last week? Yeah, I thought that was you. I wasn't sure, so I didn't say anything. So you still going out with mom? Oh, that's beautiful. Well, look, dad, I got to get back to my room. Maybe I'll see you in the living room sometime. Take it easy." I usually... What did you name them? You didn't give him the same letter names, did you? Like Jimmy, Joey, 'cause that's not healthy to do to twins. And I'll say, you have to separate them. Because it's bad enough they're twins. We named ours Gregory and Schmegory. Hmm. Which is just a coincidence. My father's name is Schmegory, and we've always loved the name Gregory. I hope I know what I'm doing, you know, especially with the discipline. I saw a woman in the store the other day. This woman... the kid had a candy bar, and she told him to put it down, and she... I'm not making this up... She looked down, and she said, "Okay, I'm giving you till the count of two." Two, doctor, is that healthy? How do you give a kid till two? PILOT 1 : Green Leader to base. Unidentified flying object in sight. Range, 1 000 yards. Permission to open fire. MAN [ON RADIO] : Base to Green Leader, permission granted. holy moly, that thing's faster than a snake-bit roadrunner. PILOT 2: What in tarnation is it, anyway? PILOT 1 : holy smoke! [PHONE RINGING] [WHIMPERING] [BARKING] -Dad. -Huh? Oh. QUEST: Hello. ALICE: Dr. Quest? -Yes. ALICE: Benton. -alice? -After all these years. I should be flattered you remembered. I've never forgotten. How could I? Those times were some of the happiest. -Did you get the package? -You sent the package? -I need your help. -Of course, but why? I gotta go. I can't explain now. [PHONE HANGS UP] alice? alice, are you there? JONNY: I still don't see why we can't come. QUEST: We've been through this, Jonny. You both have term papers. And we'II only be gone a couple of days. Come on, son. Don't give me a hard time. JONNY: Okay. Good luck. Be sure and call. [BANDIT BARKING] ALICE: The night my grandfather was called by the ancients was the very same night that the government retrieved the wreckage of an alien spacecraft at roswell airfield. That is a remarkable story. It's not a story, Benton. It's the truth. I was there, 20 years ago. I was a terrified little girl, but I remember every detail. alice, why are you telling me this now? Because I need a secret to share with you when you're gone. Wait a minute. I thought you were coming with me. -You know I can't. -But, alice.... Don't ask me again. I'II miss you, Benton, but I have to stay close to this place. I'm not sure why. I guess that's why they call it destiny. QUEST: No one can argue with destiny. What's the matter, Benton? Nothing. Nothing at all. Don't worry about it, Mrs. Evans. It was an accident. We can probably glue it right back together again. Oh, for land sakes. well, if you really think so, I suppose it's no skin off my nose. Check this out. It looks as though it's got some kind of secret compartment. Maybe there was something hidden in it once? How would you get anything in there? It's solid quartz, isn't it? That's what I thought. Let's just glue it back together and ask Dad when he gets back from Arizona. We'II take some pictures of it first, just for the files. [GROWLING] Oh, Bandit.... [WHIMPERING] [BARKING GROWLING] Bandit. Bandit! [WHIMPERING] You okay, boy? JESSIE: What's going on? -What happen--? [BARKING] -Bandit, come back. -Look, they took the stone. I'm calling the police. I'm sorry we couldn't give you any more details. We'II file a report, Mrs. Evans. Strange lights. Yeah. They been watching too much TV. Come on, Jess. Let's try Dad again. [PHONE RINGING] -He's still not picking up. -Maybe they're out of range. Uh-uh. There's a recorded message for that. What are you doing? Accessing your dad's files on alice Starseer. -Maybe she'II give us a cIue-- -What? She's cross-referenced to Anasazi legends extraterrestrial visitations and UFO intrusions. [CREAKING] JESSIE: Bandit. [GROWLING] What have you got there? JONNY: Come on, boy. Come here, give it up. -What is it? -I don't know. Beats me, Jess. But it doesn't weigh anything. Here. I've never seen any kind of metal idea. He says, "Listen, you know... "as long as the car's safe, why don't you just give me a go... "at driving it, and just stick cameras on the car?" And so what we did is, we harnessed Adrien into the car real safely. We had roll bars built into the car... so that if he should roll or anything happen to him... he would be safe inside the cage. And we put four cameras actually physically strapped onto the car... He's got the say here, so... I'm honored that he trusts me... with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cameras on the car... as I weave in and out of these streets. Here he goes. Oh, he might take a camera off the side of the car yet. Adrien drove really well... through the streets, slid the car sideways... reverse spins, 180s... Did a really good job. And we just had Adrien driving as fast as he wanted to around our King Kong set. I mean, he just drove, and took corners, and went up alleyways... and he did it a number of times. We changed the camera angles... 'cause at some point he whacks into something and half the roof comes off. I'll tell you one thing, the taxis have improved since Giuliani was in office. - Was that miked? - Yeah. We were able to achieve a lot of the sequence... a way that's not normally done in films... which is the actor actually physically doing real driving. Normally it's the last thing that happens. Normally you fake it somehow. But this is a case of the actor driving for real... and driving reasonably quickly, I have to say. Adrien got up to some fairly healthy speeds... at certain times. If you're capable of doing it, it's more believable. The way the lights reflect against the windshield... and the G-force of me sliding across the seats. You can't really replicate that as much unless the car is on some moving rig. Basically what we've got is a fantastic sequence... with our actor doing 99% of it... and it was a fantastic stunt. So thank you, Adrien. This is probably one of the most exciting days... for me, thus far. So, today it's Day 100. After 100 days of shooting, it all tends to be a little bit of a blur. I'm very tired. It feels like 100 days of shooting. A lot of people have asked if they could see what a typical day in the life of me is like. It's kind of typical. I mean, every day is different. For instance, it's 8:42 in the morning... and we don't start shooting till 1:00 in the afternoon... 'cause at the moment, we're on half-day-half-nights. But I'm rushing to Editorial right now to sit down with Jamie... our editor, to actually cut the animatic I'm gonna be shooting tonight. Peter's schedule is a mighty beast of a thing. We schedule as best we can and things tend to get pushed. But we do get them done. Sorry I'm late. I would've been on time but these video guys was here... - and they were totally disrupting me. - What's the plan? The plan is to look at the previs for the scene with Ann and Kong. This is a scene where Kong, instead of killing Ann... he has a curiosity about her. And she senses that that curiosity... is the one thing that may keep her alive. So, we've got till 10:30 to cut this. - Plenty of time. - Yeah. So, it's 10:41 now and we didn't get our previs cut. Next week, Universal are flying... 200 exhibitors and distributors down to New Zealand... and we're gonna present them with the first footage of King Kong. Some visual effects shots are finished. A lot of them are unfinished. So, I'm gonna shoot a little introduction to try to explain to people... that we're gonna see this reel... that they're gonna be looking at unfinished shots. Stand by. And, camera set. Now, it's very important to me, obviously, as the director, that you understand... that King Kong, we are still filming it. The film's coming out in December and believe me... there's a huge amount of work still to be done. But nonetheless, we're hoping that this reel is gonna give you a flavor... and the tone of the film that we're making. - Great. - Okay. - I think that was all right. - Yeah, it was perfect. I'm just gonna go to cue stage toward the Second Unit... and make sure they know what they're doing today... in the vaudeville routine. The real day begins right now. Okay. So, what can we do to help you guys? Well, actually, I just wanted to go over, you know, the... Well, the basic thing is to just capture the essence of the routine. Shoot it very simply. There's nothing fancy about the camerawork. Shoot two cameras so you can get a wide and a tight. Okay? - All right. - Thank you. All right, guys, so you guys just call me if you have any problems... or any concerns or questions at all. Thanks, mate. Can we clear underneath this, please? We're about to shoot our first shot of the day. It's 2:00, an hour after we started today. So, the first thing that we're doing is a shot of Naomi's stunt double, Min... being thrown onto the ground. Looks like we can shoot it and finish up, just like boom. We're on our way. And action! - And cut. - Cut! You see? It's that quick. Cut. I think we should move on. I mean, is Naomi ready to go? She's... She just hasn't got her wig on. I have to put her wig on, but, apart from that, she's ready. So, remember. This begins after you run... and you run over his leg, over his foot... and trip over. And then he confronts you and that's as far as they got. And I think we're ready to shoot. We put a mike on Pete so that he can be broadcast onto set. - I have so many mikes that I... - Yeah. I don't know what to do. I try to remember to turn them all off when I go to the toilet. That's better, thank you. Here we go, please. Shooting! - And roll sound! - And rolling. Playback and action! Throws her down. She lands. He's suspicious. She looks dead. And he prods. Another prod. He's not sure. He sniffs. Sniffing. One last, big prod. And cut. Okay, good. That was good. Let's just try one more for luck. That's good, we'll do another, please. Good. Should we try one more for luck? That was good, Naomi. We'll just try one more for luck. Once more please. Once more just for luck. This is Victoria. You've met Victoria before. She's our script supervisor. Hi. You had a whole video diary about you. And you haven't had one piece of fan mail yet. - One. Not one. - I'll write to you now. Where are the girls of the world that would have just, like, gone crazy for you? Even if it was one guy, at least it would be something. I see. Okay. 0kay. The boxing ladies are going for it. It's a knockout. One of them got one clean in the jaw, did they? I think, let's get them to beat the hell out of each other. Give them more muscle. We want bleeding noses. It's 6:10. I've been going since 8:30. Feeling a little bit tired but I have to keep on going till midnight. What I have to do is find time to run back into the Cutting Room... and finish cutting the animatic that I never finished. Okay, gang. Previs time. Let's try and trim up the first few shots in this sequence. No time for pleasure whatsoever. So we should get that rotation to them so they know that's what sort of... What do you reckon, Pete? So, it's this shot here. You're on the ground, you back away... and then you accidentally just stumble. That doesn't have to be a big fall backward. That could just be a stumble and a kind of... - a half fall. - Right. Because there's just enough to engage him. Here we go, please. Shooting, thank you. And playback! And action! You're terrified you're gonna die! His rage is building. He's gonna kill you! He's getting angrier! He's gonna kill you! - Here he comes! And cut! - Cut, cut, cut. Yeah, that's good. I think that was fine. People are always trying to get to Peter. There are always people sort of waiting in the wings to get answers. And quite often I'm the sounding board. And I go back and forth between those people. It's my job. I'm the go-between. This one, we're doing a couple of little tweaks again... but this is more for a temp. You've seen a couple like this before. But this is just the next one in the series. This one, there's a long head angle on. Sorry to interrupt, but Second Unit need to play down a couple of shots for you. Okay. They've got a full shot. We've got a close-up, too. It seems very red. I think it would actually look better if it was against black. - That's good. Let's do that. - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay. - Thanks. - Sure. All right, no worries. Matthew, could you please ask Peter to come and join us now? Thanks, Carol. I'll just get him for you. ...head angle on. - And then... Peter, they're ready for you on that stage. Okay, there's about three more shots to go. Carol, Pete's got three more shots to look at on the laptop... and he'll be with you. It'll be pretty quick. Maybe you should get Andy's sound thing on... One of the jobs that a director has to do is to answer questions all the time. And you have different departments coming at you constantly... wanting meetings and information about this, that, and the other. I found exactly the same thing on Lord of the Rings. At the end of Lord of the Rings, I was so tired... I could only concentrate on one thing at a time. And, you know, it's getting a little bit like that on this film. Not so bad... but it certainly gets pretty exhausting. 0ne last look at Kong and then go, go, go. - Yeah. - Cut! Checking and wrapping. Thank you. Pack up that, please. Well, there we go, the end of Day 100. Congratulations. Yes, here we go. It feels like 100 days, too. Doesn't feel like 99 days, doesn't feel like 98 days. It feels like 100 days. And it's the Second Unit's 50th day tomorrow. So, I've put a note on... 50th day? Well, they've got, they're only... I put a note on their call sheets. They're only half the men we are, Carol. Thank you, everybody. I hope you've enjoyed this look at what... a Day 100, like it is for me, I'm gonna go get some sleep. And take my microphone off... and say goodbye to you all. And see you at the next video diary. Here's all your gear. Thank you. Well, big day for us. It's day 200 of the miniatures shooting schedule which is day about 100 and a bit on the live action. We're a little ahead of them because we've had to shoot a lot of material... before the live action started. So we're getting ready to shoot what is the actual first production film rolled on King Kong. Action! Peter played this out yesterday, actually... but we were highly honored that we actually get to do this. Peter's a real hands-on filmmaker. Always has been. I think he just loves the fact that there's a process involved in filmmaking... and part of that process is shooting miniatures... that somehow enhance and extend a live-action set... so you have a small built set that's full-size, where they actually interact... with the bushes and the trees and the vines... and then we're doing everything outside this. In effect, we're creating an entire environment... within which these actors perform. So it'll be a combination of matte paintings and miniatures to bring it to life. Cut! The main miniatures are made by Weta Workshop. We then have to transport them over here from Weta Workshop. 0bviously, they're huge, as you've seen. And a phrase that got coined on Lord of the Rings was "bigatures." That doesn't seem to have changed. It's still bigatures. And, no, they're not little. They have to be huge... because they need to be enormous. And park it over the yellow line, towards the wall. We've got a few sets running at the moment. Normally we have two or three... but, presently, we have five. It's actually more than five, because this stage is doing... two shots, so we've got six set-ups. I'm doing the boat mixture in here. Put a rock wall here, a sea wall here. I figure we really either need to get roller skates or scooters or skateboards... because we're really just racing back and forth. This is Motion Control Stage K. We're shooting a broad shot here that has to be out by pretty much today. We shot it yesterday, but it's a reshoot, so we're picking up shots 37 and 40. We're in this set for a long time, a couple of hundred shots... and, of course, it's built at tenth scale, so it's one-tenth of full size. But at that scale, it means the camera's very, very close to everything... so you have to do a lot, a lot of precision detailing... on the plants, on the moving trees... on the wind, on the way the rocks look... the way things have fallen down, and so forth. The greens department have done an amazing job... of making these little miniature ferns. We've had these things for a year and two months. We started in December last year, and they would've been twice that size now... if we didn't cram the poor little bastards into a small pot. They can be on set for anywhere between one day and two months and my job is to try and keep them alive in these extreme conditions... intense light, intense heat, and intense wind. The trick is that, because we have wind in these shots... the trees are blowing around in the wind together... but they're miniature trees, so you have to run the camera fast... so that we can make... Slow them down enough so they don't just go... Like that. And to help with that, I'm putting little lead weights on them... which are little fishing sinkers, which we're clamping onto the leaves... to give them a bit more weight so they actually move... and look believable when we shoot them at 64 frames a second. Whatever's not behaving properly gets the lead shot treatment. So we're putting more wind on it, but now it's got more weight to it. Because you have to use this for so many shots... it pays to get a very high level of detail, so no matter where you look... you've got the coverage. Live-action units will be wrapping here in a month and a half... and we're gonna be shooting till 0ctober of this year, way down at the very end... because we have this enormous number of shots. We've got around... let's say, around 1,400 shots to do still before we finish. I figure that in King Kong... we've probably got twice as many shots... as we had in all the three Lord of the Rings films put together. I think one of the really special things about Peter Jackson as a director... is his use of miniatures. And now, we're all very thankful that he uses so many miniatures. And I think he's absolutely right when he says, also, that there's something... about a photographed image, be it a live-action plate... or a location plate or a miniature plate, that somehow plucks a responsive chord... in our hearts, and we say, "Yeah, I believe that." - Scene marker. - Attack. It's a scary day when you come to set and you have grown men attacking you... in bright green and blue suits. Hello. Here we are. It's Day 105. I've had some decent sleep since my Day 100 diary... where I was so exhausted I could barely stand up... but I'm feeling much better now and that's good because... we're doing some pretty complicated stuff at the moment. It's in an area of the film that, in a way, demands the most imagination... because we have no sets. It's a sequence in which Naomi is being carried by Kong... in New York. And, of course, the way we'll do that, opposed to the old Claymation version... is to shoot it all in front of a green screen here. A lot of the rest will be built in the computer at a later date. We have something that looks like a green tire... I guess you could call it, and we have a rocking base. And although, looking at the shots and looking at the way we're gonna shoot it... it seems a pretty crude method... it's actually gonna be fine. It's gonna give us everything that we need. The Kong rig is a pretty amazing and important part of the film. It's the iconic image that we're about to see... of Ann and Kong's connection. This is where the action really starts. This is where the fun starts. Just keep it kind of... Don't be too shy. And we have Andy Serkis on set to play Kong... and to work with Naomi. Naomi's stuck with looking at someone dressed like... I'll tell you. A ballet dancer on steroids. - But it seems to do the trick, doesn't it? - Yeah, it does. But thank God for this. - And it's what I focus on. - Yeah. I could feel, like, completely transported when I look at his face. I'm not looking at him wearing a funny suit. I'm looking at him with all this behavior... and all this feeling... and I can't imagine who else could make me feel what he is making me feel. That's really something. Just because we can't touch each other... doesn't mean that we can't really look, you know, inside each others' heads... which is why I'm here. - And then... - I saw you laughing at him which was fun. Playing with it is really good. That was great. That was really great. So everybody knows when we hit Central Park... which is a lighting cue and a cue for Naomi as well. The slow passive scenes with her and Kong... having a quiet moment together... and then is obviously much more action-orientated scenes... as Kong is being pursued by New York, by the military. Explosion! And sometimes he's running, sometimes he's protecting you... like he's running and protecting you here. Sometimes I might be into his chest. Sometimes he's stopping and looking over here. She's really good. Yeah, she's much better at performing than me. I get to train her. It was good. That was nice stuff. We'll just try one more for luck, eh? Okay. Look for the explosion. Screaming! Help me! Search lights sweep past! More search lights sweeping past! If you say at the beginning of the day, Naomi's gonna be in this green hand... you're gonna be on top of a scissor lift... and you're pretending to be galloping through the streets of New York... being chased by the military, you think, "Okay, all right." But I'm gonna see what other elements put in. I mean, for me, having lived through that scene now... to be able to take you to the next level with motion capture... and given that I won't have Naomi there probably, but it'll be Barbie... you know, that'll be great. Thank you very much. It was good. You all right? - That was kind of fun. - The whole day riding the hand. Yeah. Many variations on the hand. - That's right. - We covered the spectrum. How many people out there would have liked the day in Kong's hand? - It's like going to the fairground. - It is. That's gotta be one of my most challenging days on a film set, I have to say. Cut! Cut that! Hi, there. It's Day 108 today. And we're doing a few more scenes on the deck of the Venture... which you can see behind me here in Studio B. But what we are actually gonna do today is a production diary that's based on... a lot of requests that we've had from fans. So for Lucie, Roy, Jeremy, David, Anthony... Andrew, Cathy, Chris, Roxy, Josh, Hilary, and Brurah... we're gonna do a day in the life of the makeup department. Today I have the manitou. And the manitou is a pimple that's so big, that it's not just a pimple. It could be a living organism inside growing... in a fetus inside my face. So we might need to operate. And then after nine months it pops, and the devil comes out. It's the devil's child, the manitou. Hair and Makeup are there for the director. They're there to realize his vision. And we're there to help the actors and actresses... portray the parts they're playing. One of the good things about being in Hair and Makeup... is the fact that you get a big trailer like this. The makeup trailer can be a fun place. Oh, yeah, everything happens in the makeup bus. Hello. All roads lead back to the makeup bus. We are the first people that get the actors in, in the morning. And, you now, not everybody gets a great night's sleep. I didn't shave, because today, I have to have two days' growth. So I'm not unprofessional if that's what you're thinking. "Dude doesn't even shave." A lot of my job is research. To search for information about a period. And there's no point putting lipstick and eyelashes on... if you don't know why you're doing it. I've had the same crappy haircut... since August. But he means that in the best possible way. And I'm not saying that you gave me a bad haircut. - She gave me a great haircut. - It's just 1933. Exactly, it's 1933. I think I had the same haircut when I was, like, seven. As far as King Kong goes, we want to sell everything as if it actually happened. The theme we're aiming for all the time is realism. We also keep extensive continuity records... which means that we'll take photographs and take notes... so that when we do have to reproduce it, we can do it quite efficiently... and very precisely. It's been a while. - And we need to shave you. - Oh, no. Andy Serkis shot scenes today... that we initially shot before Christmas. And so there was a little bit of continuity bringing him back to Lumpy... and we had to retattoo him and lots of dirt and grime... and all those kind of things. You'd eat the food cooked by this man, wouldn't you? Sometimes people are... Oh, the wounds are healing... 'cause it's a couple of weeks after. Then reducing the wound or so forth... or the wound then disappears. All that sort of stuff. It's great putting people through torture and pain and then making them look silly. It sounds so cool. Yeah, it's great. I use hair and makeup as tools. You know, you arrive at work in your normal fashion... and then you get into character... and you use makeup and hair to help you get closer to that. Jack did a very smart thing and went wig... so that he could have his normal Jack hair. It wasn't really a move on my part to get a wig... but it worked out to my advantage... 'cause you throw in a wig and it gives me a 1930s hairdo. And then you take if off, and look what's under it: Rock 'n' roll. Yeah, the wigs, I mean... My company makes the wigs... because we weren't satisfied with the wigs that were around... and trying always to achieve them... so that people don't know that they're actually wearing wigs. Half the day, at least half the day, maybe more is... keeping the artist looking exactly the same. Let's say we started at 5:00 a.m. And we might shoot that one scene... for 14 hours. So we have to keep everybody looking exactly the same for 14 hours. What's happened by the time she's sitting in this chair... until the time she's on the set, a lot of things can change. And so I always have to go up and check and make sure everything is just perfect. Final checks. Okay, jumping out of there, please, gang. I need to get Naomi in there. We're going to shoot. It's all about people's personalities as much as the makeup skills and everything... that everyone gets on well and works well together. - See what they do to me? - It's such a glamorous business, isn't it? You have to have very good chemistry with the people... that are doing your hair and makeup... because they're the last people to touch you before you roll. And I don't think it would be possible to do it... without feeling those good vibes. Okay, here we come. Rick, Naomi's on set. We need you. - Gotta go, bye. - Stop talking, come on. Hello, it's Day 110 here on the shoot. And what our production diary is going to be about is the recent Summit. Which was a visit that was arranged by Universal Studios... who got a whole lot of people down to New Zealand to have a look at some footage. The Summit is different to the press junket which we showed you earlier. They were cinema owners, exhibitors, people that own distribution chains... they were people associated with the merchandising deals. And it was basically Universal's attempt to... give them a very early sneak peek at what we were doing. And from our point-of-view an early sneak peek is fine... but obviously it led to a huge amount of hard work... because in order to get a piece of film ready to show... while we're still actually making it, is obviously a big ask... and it wasn't like a trailer, two or three minutes... it was 18 minutes of footage that we wanted to screen for these people. So we went into overdrive to try to, at the very last minute... pull the surreal together. I think although people were as positive as they could be... about the idea of the Summit... the implications on their schedule were pretty difficult. So the guys have been going great guns on building this... fairly sizeable chunk of miniature. And we have a very short deadline to get it delivered. It's almost an urban myth that things turn up on the back of an envelope or napkin... but we actually got handed this design this morning. It's definitely impacted us in animation. Put it this way, I don't think they were prepared to get stuff on film this early. We've got quite a few effects' shots to do... which is somewhat daunting, and we try not to think about it too much. But we'll just keep slamming through it and get there. What I'll do is I'll grade up scenes... that we knew that were going to be in the summit reel. We didn't necessarily know every single shot... so I just had to grade all the shots in all these scenes. And send them over to Editorial, and Editorial had to put it in the cut. It really put pressure on the whole Editorial Department. So it was one of those things sort of right to the wire... before we could actually get ready to screen. This will be the first time that an audience will see our work. So it's exciting for us, and we are really hoping that they enjoy it. I think everyone was really excited to be in New Zealand. Some of them were a little bit tired but the first day they were... so excited about what they'd toured around, and what they'd seen. First up, we went for a visit out to Seaview with the New York setters... And had their photos taken. Look at that. New York in 1933, in living color this time. Not in black-and-white. They also got to have their photo taken outside the real Venture. Action! It's very important that we get them very excited... about what we're trying to do. So to that end, we've been taking tours of 35 people at a time. And we're walking them through the workshop... and showing them everything that we've been doing. They've also been visiting the miniature stage... the shooting stages, and other bits and pieces... that's going on around Miramar. I'll see you all in the cinema for more waffling in a minute. And last, but not least... they watched the Weta digital presentation given by Joe Letteri. This is from the first week's shooting. This is the scene of Ann arriving at the docks. This is now putting all the bits together. Later on in the evening, they returned back to the Camperdown theater... for a surprise. ...that I just want to thank you again very much for coming down. I thought we'd show you a little bit of the film... but in a very crude, animatic form. It's very unusual explaining footage to anybody at this early stage. And I must admit I was a little nervous. And finally thought, "0h, my God... "I'm actually going to be showing some people some of this film." It was quite exhilarating for us because Peter got a standing ovation... and so it seemed like it was all worthwhile. So it was really great. - Thank you all so much for coming down. - Thank you. What was amazing about the Summit was the reaction we got from everyone. It was just one of those things that gave the tone and the feel of the movie. And no one really had any idea what they were going to see. It's great to finally after a few months of seeing maquettes of Kong... actually seeing him move. That was a really wonderful snapshot. To get a sense of what the whole tone of the movie is going to be. Keep up the good work. The great thing about getting a good reception is that... it gives you a bit of a morale boost. And it's made us sort of a little bit more excited about the film that we're working on. So looking forward now to just getting the shoot finished... and push the film through to its completely finished state. So that those 18 minutes now becomes a fully-fledged feature film. Hi, welcome to the Second Unit Production Diary. I'm Randy Cook, Second Unit Director, and we're gonna show you today... a few of the things that Second Unit's been up to for the last couple of months... while Peter's been directing Main Unit. Go ahead, pitch! A lot of the stuff we do tends to fill out sequences that have already been shot by Main Unit. They basically film a scene... then we come along afterwards and pick up all the little bits that are left over. So, as a result I'm doing things that Pete has neither time nor inclination to do. Some of the shots out on the Venture. The only stuff we've filmed on the boat, so far, has been in the parking lot. They say it's because it's a better controlled environment you can get better shots, but we all know... Peter's... I think he vomits, apparently. As soon as he steps on a boat, vomit happens. And we got to shoot scenic shots of Ann and Jack... being swept down a river. What we're gonna do is have a Tarzan swing into the river. Three, two, one, swing into frame and let go at the right time. And hopefully we'll have a nice, spectacular splash. They're getting slapped around a little bit. So they're really suffering for their art today, that's for sure. We've shot everything from typical inserts of stuff... to car chases, which is, you know, the usual domain of the Second Unit... to actual close-ups on the principal actors. It's always a breath of fresh air actually, going over to another unit. Ready! And three, two, one, head! Three, two, one, pack! The treadmill was just something that everybody got subjected to... at one point or another. Three, two, dance off! Back. It was always a bit of a competition between everybody... who could run the fastest on the treadmill. Cut! I was the fastest runner on the treadmill... that I almost needed hospitalization afterwards, okay? Peter and I have similar tastes in some areas. However, we only get to work together real briefly in the morning. He gives us a real quick brief about what he wants, and then we go out and do it... and show him what we're up to. We use video cables, we use Internet wherever Peter is, he's gonna be getting a picture from Second Unit. This is our Second Unit monitor down here, which is showing us... what Second Unit are doing. They're doing their vaudeville routines. That's good, that's good. It's a very interesting job, being another director's hands... you know, because you have to have the ability to do it. Yet you have to go with that director's flow. Yeah, we're on the Hooverville set today... Hooverville being sort of, I guess, the slums. It's the depression times. All the people are out of work, they're bored... they're just sitting around. We're just shooting a montage of shots. Basically, what we're filming here... the extras out there don't even know when the cameras are rolling. I was a Hoovervillian today and I sat around and acted bored. Which I was. Half the time, when you turn the camera off, they start looking natural... and as soon as you tell them they're turning it on they'll look really unnatural. So we spent the whole morning rolling without anyone really knowing. We were bouncing around all over the film on that day because... we went from the shantytown to Skull Island... with natives' feet running around in the rain... to the skyscrapers of New York under construction. All of it, of course, was on the back lot, crammed quite close together. From the depths to the heights today, in more ways than one. 0ne of the exciting things about working on Second Unit for Peter is that... you do get to do things that other Second Unit... directors don't necessarily get to do. We're not, you know, just expressly doing car chases... and people falling in the river. We're getting to work with the main actors, and sometimes getting to... finish off scenes that he started. You know, again, he gives you a lot of leeway, at times... and one appreciates that trust. I think you should be as extreme as you wanna be. - Let's do it! - You know, it's vaudeville, go for it! - Boy, is that the right answer! - Go for it. Hello. Welcome to day 115. Today, we're going to show you a little bit of the sound department. Several of you have written in... wanting to know more about the technicalities of recording sound on set. Jeremy, Matthew, Jody, Don, Stefan, Akash... Bryan, Nick, Nathan, Keith and Mike. It's ironic that this particular production diary is on this day... Today happens to be the day that we're recording... a scene involving our Carl Denham, sound recordist. Of course, in 1933, they were having to record sound themselves... and they have much the same problems as we still do today. We're off on a magical journey. A journey into sound. My title is Production Sound Mixer. And my job is to record sound at the time the film is shot. So, like the scene that we're doing today... we've got a whole heap of characters who are all gonna be doing lines... which means I've gotta put out a number of microphones... and I'll mix all that shit together to record the actors' dialog. We're doing a master and there's a lot of characters talking... so we need to put out a lot of mikes. There'll be boom mikes... there'll be plant mikes or radio mikes on people... You think this is about sound, it's actually not. They're doing me for drugs. That's right. If you find any, you owe me money. It's pretty amazing how these guys are able to hide microphones in ties... and in jackets. The only downside to the radio mike is... you need a little battery pack. Sometimes, it's wrapped around your ankle... like a prisoner, like house arrest. This is worse than house arrest... 'cause now there's someone in your house listening to your every move. Go and do it now. Day in the life of a sound man, it's tough. It's tough what they have to endure. We're going to be shooting very soon, thank you, gang. Getting almost nervous now. It's the first shot of the day and it's pretty tight in here. - And here we go, shooting, please. - And here we go. - And roll sound. - Sound's rolling. Speed. And action. I'm gonna have the ship's engines over all the dialog. Seagulls, camera noise, wind, God knows what else. I don't care, Mike. You're the sound operator. Make it work. Cut. That was a bit of a roughie to start with. But we'll sharpen up as we go. - Here we go, thank you, and roll sound. - Rolling. Speed. I try and get everything I can on the boom. You know, you try and get a boom in there as much as possible... because it's generally a better sounding microphone. And cut. So we're two takes into it now. We've... Obviously, we've had some problems. We've got a construction site next door. A supermarket's building a new car park or something. So it's very apt. We've got a scene about a sound recordist... who's complaining about all this noise in the background. And we've actually got... loads of noise in the background here. - Here we go, thank you, and roll sound. - Speed. Why are you always saying "speed"? Well, actually, Julia, that's a good question. Why am I always saying "speed" on set? "Speed"? Well, that's a good question. It starts back, a long time back. Me and my friends were back in the pub in about 1962. And we were... Also part of the sound department's job is to silence people on set... who really just don't make any sense. And action. Mike, you are the shama-lama-ding-dong. Get it right. Fix it. Make it work. I mean, I'd love to be able to tell you who actually kind of fluffed their lines. Strictly between you and me, it could have been Jack. Come on in, I'll introduce you to the peeps, my crew: This is... bad. I don't care, Mike. You're the sound recordist. Make it work. That's awesome. Awesome, guys. Another day on set. Yeah, it's a good scene. I was in that scene today. I think it'll shape up really well. It was a long, hard, rugged day. Sometimes, you just, you gotta get smelly, you gotta get hot... you gotta push it to the limits... in the field of sound. And today, I think we took it to the limit. This is about day 118 of the shoot... although it's really a second unit day. Randy's in here. I'm just coming in 'cause it's too much fun to miss. And, of course, I just get to sit back and take a snooze... while Pete runs the set. Well, I wasn't intending to today... No, you weren't intending to... This is more like... This is too much like good fun. We're into the first of four days worth of shooting the Helldivers... which are the biplanes that attack Kong on the Empire State Building. Curtiss Helldivers, they are the American naval plane of the early 1930s. And they are the same aircraft as what they used on the original film. After a bit of research, we found out that no original Helldivers existed. We were expecting to be able to copy one that was in a museum in the States. It was weird but we found out that no museums had one... that was actually an extinct aircraft. They're all gone. You can't even buy a plastic model kit of this plane. So we had to go to the Smithsonian and gather together... the original factory drawings for the plane. So we could actually recreate one. So we started with the original drawings... and decided to build the airplane just like they did in the factory in 1933. All the sizes and shapes and everything on this airplane is true to the original form. The plane is built out of steel tube... and given it's shape with aluminum stringers... and covered with fabric just like the real airplane would've been. Just putting the fabric on the bare structure is the easy bit. Then, we need to put reinforcing tapes over the ribs... and rib-stitch it with a needle right through. And then there's all kinds of paint that goes on top of it. There's about three coats of clear dope... then there's three more coats of silver... and then the top coat of whatever color it is. It does have a few original parts... that would have been the same parts used on a real Helldiver. The wheels and an instrument or two, to make it authentic. Where's my fricking pilot? 0ur pilot is Jim Dietz, who is a very renowned military artist. I've actually got some of his World War I flying paintings... on my walls, on the wall of my office. And the gunner is Rick Porras... who was our co-producer on all three Lord of the Rings movies. Rick's just come down to New Zealand for a vacation. He's not working on Kong, but he's jumped in the gunner's seat. So I'm sitting here just thinking: "These guys are actually really having all the fun, aren't they?" And three, two, one! Cut. I just want to go into a real one now, now after we've been sitting in this. But I heard that there really aren't any Helldivers around anymore. So that's a bit unfortunate, but... It's just really, it's got a good feeling with the wind. You almost feel like you're up there for real. It will be memorable. As they say, into the sunset. You know, the trick with this sort of stuff... is to make sure the planes don't look too much like they're stuck in a studio. 0bviously, the blue screen gets replaced with the skies of Manhattan... but we're doing a lot of things like moving the sun. We have a little sun on the end of a big crane and we... swing that around so that you really get this great moving shadow effect. And we're putting a lot of vibration into the plane... lot of vibration to the camera so all the wires... You know the flying wires that are holding the plane together... are kind of vibrating and we kind of, sort of... add that level of realism to what's essentially faking the flying. Not everything's fake. We've got all these guns. Everything's fake except those hot shells that are flying all over the place. The guns aren't fake. The guns are real guns. Projects like this are really cool in a way. I mean, none of these airplanes exist anywhere. And we've just created one from scratch. And now, there's a Curtiss Helldiver. If it ends up in a museum somewhere... people from all over can actually come and see one, touch one... and have an idea what one of these airplanes actually looks like. Yeah. Never really grow up, do you, boys? Never grow up. Planes and guns. Build your big model planes. It's cool. Hi. This is Day 120 of our production diary... and we're getting towards the end of the film. We're here in the wet, dank... K Stage jungles of Skull Island... doing a little bit more with Naomi and some dinosaurs today. Second unit are filming Adrien... doing a little bit of cab driving. It's interesting, movies don't really end... with a climactic kind of moment. They tend to dwindle... and it becomes a process of long goodbyes. Yes. Well, that was Jack's last shot, everybody. 0ver the last couple of weeks, we've said goodbye to Jack Black. He finished everything that Denham had to do and so he was able to leave. I get squeezes. That's part of the fun. Colin Hanks playing Preston, left. We are now down to, I think, it's three more days of shooting with Adrien. I'm hanging out on a rope, with Naomi on my back... in a couple of little scenes to pick up a few stunts... and I'm home free for a bit. But I'm aware that, you know, reshoots... Maybe a few weeks, maybe... another movie. And we're set. That was good. That was a good one, Adrien. That's cool. Adrien has a couple more days. There's a scene in a theater, which is the last set, I think, that's being built. So, this is the Arty Theater. This is what you call "a-set-within-a-set." So we build a set which is the theater... and then we build a backdrop which is the set... and that's sort of happening as we speak. So here we are, in the Empire State Building, in Q Stage. This is a set we've just put together over the last few weeks... and it's going to be shooting in two days' time. Today's also a sad day for us 'cause the New York set... out on the Hutt Valley, is being demolished. We wanted to have our wrap party in the New York set... except, we had this demolition date and we couldn't keep the set... till the very end of the shoot... 'cause it had to be gone and we had to clear it away. But nonetheless, it was a good day. An amazing party on the New York streets. So I'd just like you to all give a huge welcome to Neil Finn. Good afternoon, all. Fantastic to be here. And now, today, the set gets demolished. Well, it's nice and quiet in here. It's really busy out at New York streets. The guys are starting to strike it now. Normally we'd just smash it all up and put it in the rubbish... but we are saving a lot of New York streets. What we do when we destroy sets is we keep little bits of them... just in case we want to do more filming with them later. There is, you know, the possibility we may use it for some pickups... or maybe even another film. And action. Naomi we hang on to till almost the very end. You know, we deliberately planned our schedule... so that we would just be able to reduce things down to... shots of Naomi to the very end. And so, we're slowly reducing the size of our crew. Obviously, as we get down to shooting with two actors and then one actor... you don't need as many people in the wardrobe department... make-up departments, you know, the AD's department. The film just becomes smaller. You end up almost like you're making a home movie by the time you're done... and it doesn't really ever get any easier. I mean, the scenes that we're shooting with Naomi at the very end... they're very complicated effects scenes. Lot's of interaction between her and Kong and dinosaurs, with blue screens... and having to comp in creatures. So, it sort of keeps your brain going right to the very end. And action. So that's what our next two weeks holds. You know, the light's at the end of the tunnel. It's a good feeling. Everyone's enjoying just getting the film shot now... and that's what we're facing in this last couple of weeks. - Cut, good. - Cutting. That was fine. Hello. Welcome to production diary... for Day 123. For the last two or three months... something's been going on behind the scenes... that's sort of exciting. And today is the day that... Universal have allowed us to talk about it for the first time. Very soon after our Christmas break... Universal started to talk to Fran, Philippa, and myself... about the idea of a possible sequel to King Kong. And based on that, we've now solidified our plans... for what would be, effectively, the Son of Kong. Yeah, this is just tremendously exciting for us, you know, at Universal. We had some production money stashed away... for the second Chronicles of Riddick. But we're not producing that particular picture. So, happily, we had a significant budget... and we're going to make Son of Kong with it immediately. Because the screenplay is reasonably long... and pretty rich, Universal have agreed... that we're basically going to split it into two movies and shoot them back to back. One of the things Universal is best at, renowned for, is the franchise business. So, it's just a phenomenal opportunity for us. It was a little tricky getting the main cast back, because as you can imagine... with Adrien, Naomi, and Jack... they had already been making plans. It's a relief for me that it's finally out of the bag... 'cause it was top secret for so long. I couldn't even tell my family or anything about what was going on. If anyone has been paying attention, we've sort of been dropping little clues. I'm really excited because I've never been in a sort of... a sequel before. I've never been in, like, a franchise thing. It's quite a great experience for me and my character... because she discovers, when she hears that back in the jungle... that son of Kong is still alive. She, you know, a la Sigourney Weaver, Gorillas in the Mist... runs back to the jungle... because she wants to be there and nurture him... because she owes that to King Kong himself. It takes place, like, 10 years after the first one. So it's right in the middle of World War II. Denham returns to Skull Island... except, Denham now is involved with the US government's war effort. And so, it's a great opportunity to return to Skull Island, but then... the story actually ultimately climaxes in Europe. It's weird. We go to Germany with son of Kong... and he helps us defeat Hitler. Rather than just have son of Kong... fighting, you know, more dinosaurs on Skull Island... he is going to be able to... combat some genetically mutated creatures... that the Nazis are building and so... as you can imagine, we are now, you know... gearing up to basically do the conceptual art. So, in total parallel, with all the work we've been doing on Kong... the likes of Rob and the other sculptors... have simultaneously been sculpting these characters... like this 17 foot tall albino that we see standing here. And we're very lucky to have Andy Serkis coming back, too... to play son of Kong. I just had this idea for Son of Kong. It sounded ridiculous at the time, but Pete's up for anything. I said, "Can we do some motion capture using my son Louis?" Because Louis' now nine months, he's nine months old... and it's exactly the same as an infant gorilla. So for next week... we're going to be doing the first motion capture on a child. Well, not even... I mean, he's not even a child. He's a baby. The previous team started with some very simple ideas... of just how son of Kong would... walk and run. There's one scene... where I'm kind of like riding on his back... me and Adrien and Naomi. So, in Son of Kong, there's quite a lot of comedy sequences and fun stuff. But there's also a couple of really good action sequences. So one of the things we're going to have to do... is, on the shoulders of the gorilla... we want to mount a couple of Browning machine guns. And we're now just starting to do some of the more major sequences. Particularly, a very involved sequence... involving Russian T-34 tanks... and Kong just outside the Führer bunkers. So this is actually our very first set... that we have designed for the sequels... for Kong 2 and 3. It's a Bavarian chalet... where Denham is going to have his headquarters... when he's behind the lines in World War II. We'll probably have to go on location to Europe later on in the year... about three weeks of location work... where we'll need to just gather those, you know, the castles... and the towns and the wide shots that will establish the European feel... which we don't have that sort of stuff here in New Zealand. One of the hardest parts of doing it... is prepping for the stuff we're gonna be shooting in Europe later on. Sort of trying to get together studio space... get gear ready to go over... get our lighting continuity packages sorted out. It'll just be nice to be somewhere else... that's just a little different. Be nice to get away from the blue screens just a bit more. Of course, it's made these final weeks of shooting... the first movie rather complicated because... we basically have very little preproduction time. So, my day on the set these days... is basically shooting the scenes with Naomi for the first film... and at the same time I'm just having impromptu meetings all over the place... to try to organize what needs to be organized for films 2 and 3. Now, Simon, if we could just make sure these trees are kept secure... for two or three months and... we'll look forward... - to getting back in the jungle here... - Yeah. ...later on this year. So it's going to be a busy year for us... and you'll be able to follow it all here on the kongisking. That looks great. That's a fantastic color. I think wardrobe's an important part of King Kong because it... We are telling a period story... so the sets and the costumes are what take you into that world. My research of this started with the original film. So we wanted to keep it true to that '30s style of filmmaking. And it sort of embraced so many areas that the original hasn't... like, you know, vaudeville, burlesque... and it tries to show the very dark side of New York that you see. Basically, the process starts by... Terry gives us a design and we do a pattern. We make up a toile, which is a mock-up, on a plain fabric. And we get that as close as possible... and do any alterations... and then we cut it out in the real fabric... and machining and hand sewing and all sorts of things... and we've finished. The end. There's this dress... that has caused a lot of drama. We had a scene a long time ago... that had this dress in it, called "the locket scene." We all loved this dress. But the scene went. Now we've rewritten a new scene for this dress... done in gold. It's a beautiful fabric. Silk gauze. And it's a good moment for it... 'cause she's got to look overdressed and fluffy. And I think we're going down a fluffy road here. Let me say what a lovely dress. Oh, this old thing. I just threw it on. In previous scenes, like the New York streets... we hired a lot of costumes... from Australia, England, and LA. It was just really the vast quantities of period that we needed there... that we couldn't possibly have manufactured. We dressed about 3,000 people. I reckon we've easily made 1,500 costumes. We're going for gold, here, guys. We want it to look gorgeous. And action. It would be really nice to use original worn-out clothes... on, say, the sailors. But just the nature of the beast... is that each of those sailors has to get... wet, bloodied, muddied. So they can't just have one costume. They have to have multiples of that costume... so the only way we can do that is to make them new... and then put them through a process that takes them to a stage... where they look like these guys have lived in them... for the past five years. This is the breakdown area... and these are Jack Driscoll's shirts. And so basically, they all have to be done the same. In this case, it's a lot of raw umber paint... and then this kind of artificial mud that you've got here. And, of course, it all has to be permanent dirt... because they can't wear them for six months... without having them laundered. So it all has to be permanent so they can be washed... and they come out of the washing machine... looking as bad as they went in. They just smell a lot better. Come on down. We'll take you down for the fitting. Today we did fittings for the Arty Theater. It's actually where Jack Driscoll's written a play. And we're going for a slightly quirkier '30s look. The men are just really in pinstripe suits with outrageous ties. But the ladies have been really interesting today... 'cause we've done some pretty interesting designs on them. Strong tailored silhouettes with really geometric hats. So it's quite an interesting thing for the ladies. - You look sensational. - I feel it. - Great! - Fantastic. The costumes are very important... to get the feel of the period right... and also where you are in terms of how rich people are... or how poor people are. It gives you those senses. So, wardrobe's an important part of every movie... but particularly in King Kong, and it looks amazing. So it's been a really enjoyable one as well. Hello. Welcome to Day 127. And we have a video diary today that some of you have requested. Mark and Jean-Philippe and others have wanted to know... what the unit photographer does. The unit photographer is the stills photographer. We're using a gentleman called Pierre Vinet. And Pierre has been on every one of my movies since Braindead. This is a hat that my mother made for Pierre. Brain-Dead. I have been with Peter for 13 years. And the thing I like about being a still photographer for Peter is... I don't really have a budget of how much I can shoot. I just shoot everything. Action. 0bviously, it's a critically important role... because the stills photographer... produces the first images of the movie that anyone ever sees. They see the stills a long time before they see the movie, normally. The stills always provide the first impression of the film. So far, I've shot about 60,000 pictures... on this production. What you have to do is you have to create... the mood of the whatever you want." "Everyone has to pay in the end." "Be a little scared, son." "Or Gabbar will show up." "Do whatever you want." "Everyone has to pay in the end." "Be a little scared, son." "Or Gabbar will show up." "Gabbar." "Gabbar." "Gabbar." "Why should bravo?" "Gabbar." "Gabbar." "Gabbar." My brother Kevin is in a book. KEVIN: No, no, no, no. Wow! Give that to me. No, I'm not! Where did you get that? Hey, if you don't want me to find something, don't leave it just sitting there in the middle of the garbage. Kevin, it looks just like you. I mean, it doesn't have the gray pubes, but it's close. And the artist was very generous in the crotchal region. Oh, this is actually great for Ellie, because she can literally see where she came from. Very funny. It is not me, but it did freak me out, so I tore it out of Ellie's sex ed book to throw in the garbage. I wish I could be in class to hear the teacher try to explain it. Like... "The Kevin, "while having sex with his spouse, thinks about his best friend, The Pete." Okay. Oh, really, really funny. Real mature, coming from a bunch of choad jugglers. What's that, now? Choad jugglers. You're choad jugglers. Not really landing like it used to. It's starting to lose its steam. I don't think so. I think it burns, still. Yeah, no, no. Take it from the Viper. You need a new hook, Kevlar. I got plenty of new stuff, so don't worry about me, okay? Oh, great. Let's hear it. We're excited. What do you got? I'm... I'm workshopping it still, so... when it's ready to be heard, you will then feel the burn. What, do you have, like, a lamer group of friends that you open mic with? I gotta say, this artist is great. Really impressed by his use of the three pillars of genital drawings: scale, perspective and dick shading. Wow. I find it really disturbing that you're interested in a picture of your naked brother. Get your mind out of the gutter. The only reason I'm interested is because I draw my own porn to masturbate to. KEVIN: What? Really? Why? I'm a DIY kind of guy. Taco, masturbation is DIY. Yeah, well, I've been having a rough time lately. If I spend the whole day drawing a picture, it kind of takes the element of surprise out of it. I'm thinking of bringing in another artist to spice things up. Andre? Want to draw some porn with me? Enough of your insults. No, thank you. I think he actually wants to draw porn with you. Ooh, I'd love to. Of course you would, you dumb piss-juggler. Hmm? What? Piss-juggler. This guy. Juggling piss. How do you juggle a liquid? It's, you know... Ay-ay-ay. ...in canisters and he... PETE: You just changed one word. You just replaced "choad" with "piss." Bah, you don't... you don't know what... I said. (knock on door) KEVIN: Hey, sweetie? How's homework going? Not so great. Some jerk tore the page out of my health textbook. What? Oh, my goodness. These kids! Damn it! I don't know how I'm going to finish this presentation without it. Oh, rough stuff. Anyway, I came to talk about the bullying. Okay, you know that if that bully calls you anything, you can tell me, right? Yeah. Has he said anything else, recently? Uh, yesterday he called me "Buttly." Buttly? Buttly. "Buttly" doesn't... doesn't really roll off the tongue. Buttly... The other kids were laughing. Oh, yeah, but those kids are animals. They'll laugh at anything. I doubt it would please a more discerning audience. "Buttly" is just lazy, really, when you think about it. It's just adding "-ly" on top of a body part. How about "footly"? You have big feet. Footly... Okay, Dad, I don't want to talk about the bully. No, I know, he's mean. And very uneven, creatively. Okay, I really need help with my sex ed homework. I hear you. Listen, if he calls you anything, you let me know, okay? In fact, write it down. Sound it out if you don't know how to spell it. Okay, Dad. Get it done. Thanks for the help. Good talk, baby. I love you so much. This kid shows a lot of promise. Man, I would love to be a Big Eskimo Brother. Sorry. In order to be a Big Eskimo Brother, you have to be having sex at the EBDBBnB. If not, it's just creepy. Yeah, but I'm a pretty good role model. I mean, I could help the kids, you know. Three monogamous relationships is hardly a role model, Andre. Check the facts. Three and a half. KEVIN: Whoa. What are you doing with all these pictures of boys? These are my Little Eskimo Brothers. Wait, this is Cooper Harris. This is Ellie's bully. Cooper. Good kid. What a small world. I thought you set up this whole Taco Cares program to focus on bullying. Exactly. I'm recruiting young bullies from the community and giving them the tools and structure to thrive in the world. Wait, you're helping bullies. Yeah. If I don't, who will? Everyone's always looking after the underdog, but who is looking after the overdog? No one, because an overdog isn't a thing. It's just a dog. These are children you're talking about. They're getting kicked out of parks, they're getting kicked offline. The EBDBBnB is a sanctuary for these young children. They don't need sanctuary; they need psychiatric help. I was bullied as a child and look at me today. I'm the successful CEO of a multi-dollar corporation. You can't really argue with that. Yeah. TACO: Ah! Welcome to the EBDBBnB. After the "P" goes in the "V," give back to the community. What are you doing? There's kids around here. Can I serve you a cold beverage, sir? No. Riley! (snaps fingers) I truly don't need a drink, Taco. You're... oh. No, I don't want them anymore. It took too long. Hey! The grown-ups are talking! Stop the lawn mower. Just cut it with your fingers for a bit. TACO: Hey. Scrub that tree. Want to be able to see my face in it. Without the attitude. Okay? I just want to speak to Cooper Harris, if I can. I like Cooper. He's the only one of these kids that's not a huge loser. Sorry, but you know it's true. Come on. Follow me. You're not a loser. Come on, vacuum that grass. I want to be able to eat off of it. Who's got the chainsaw? Come on, that tree's not gonna cut itself down. No, no! Don't touch the chainsaw! (chainsaw revving) You. Up the ladder. Hurry up. What are you, a baby? You-you are a baby. Don't go up the ladder. Oh, my God, Taco! ANDRE: You know, it was a really smart move on your dad's part to bring in a doctor to help you with this sex ed stuff. Yeah, he's been really weird about it. I mean, all I have to do is write a report. Don't worry about it. We're not gonna just sit around and talk about sex all day long like a bunch of Samanthas. I don't get it. Of course you don't, you know? Your mind's not on this planet right now. You're being bullied, you're being picked on. Let me tell you something. There are two types of people in this world. Feces-sippers and feces-servers. You know, when I was your age, I, sipped a wee bit of the feces. You still chugging it? I didn't chug it, okay? I sipped it. And you're sipping it, too, so don't be all high and mighty, okay? We need you to start serving the feces. 'Cause I don't want you picked on like I was. I mean, even your dad used to pick on me. He used to? Just last night he called you sad. Well, that means something different to adults. Well, whatever it means, you're a super version of it. Well, I'm gonna focus on the super part, not the second part. They say that they'd rather not watch football than go to Andre's. You're so smart, you think that's me? No, that's a restaurant downtown. If you ever got out and had a life, you would realize that. Okay, well, they really hate it there. Oh, yeah, well, you know what? I mean, they say the owner has terrible taste and he's color-blind. He's really ugly and old. Okay, you know what? Let me tell you something, you are being picked on, and so am I, and we need to fight back. What we're gonna do is we're gonna serve up some feces. And next time someone picks on you, you need to look them right in the eye and be like, "What's that, you big choad juggler?" What? I know. Your dad said it's not, like, appropriate for you, but I actually think you can handle it. It's funny, right? That's not funny. No, it's hilarious. Everyone's gonna laugh. You'll be like, "choad juggler, choad juggler." Andre, I mean it. Stop calling me that! (groans) And don't you ever call me that again. Ever. (groans) Way to fight back, Ellie. Andre, you just got decked like Geno Smith. I'm gonna be out for six to ten week. TACO: Hey, Cooper, what's going on? Why'd you give up on the leaf blower? 'Cause there's no more leaves, Taco. Stop complaining. If there are no more leaves on the ground, you pull them off the tree, okay? Hey, I need four volunteers to help me bury a dead animal. Let's go. Hey, Cooper. I'm Ellie's father. I'd like a word with you, please. Oh, you're that choad juggler's dad? Hey, you need to stop calling her that right now. First of all, it's very hurtful to her. And secondly, it's getting a little old. All right, that's one gutter. Now move on to the next one, the one with the wasps nest. Hurry up. Uncle Taco, I need your help. What's wrong, Ellie? You seem upset. Did you get fired from your job or something? Worse. My dad's bullying me. Ellie, whatever your father said, I'm sure he meant to say it behind your back. And my parents won't help me with my health class presentation. It's due soon. I lost the diagram. I don't know where to start. The Kevin diagram? Yeah. Oh. You've come to the right place, my dear. You can help me? Absolutely. Follow me. My God, thank you so much. Hey, vacuum this dirt. It's disgusting. Come on. Daniel, when you're done with the bathroom, I want you to clean the fruit. Jimmy, while we're gone, I want you to rearrange everything in this room in a fun and surprising way. Thank you. If you want to say anything to Ellie in the future, I want you to say it to me right now, especially if it's scatological or pun-based with a body part. So come on. Hit me with it. Let's hear it. Come on. Okay, Buttly. Is that your attempt at humor? It's funny. I'm not laughing. Are you laughing? Baby Ray Romano's not laughing. Come on, man. You're supposed to be the best. That's all you have, "Buttly"? I was coming off a detention. And I have a nightmare load of homework. - And my dog is sick. - I see your ability to come up with excuses still works well. Now, I could explain sex ed to you all day long, but a picture is worth a thousand positions. Welcome to my studio. Well, this isn't creepy at all. What a relief. I was worried you wouldn't like it. Oh, I'm sorry. This is... inappropriate for a child. Much better. I call this one "H..." Nothing. I've been studying your father's naked body for a while. He has some really interesting angles. Still haven't mastered that lilt yet. It's really tricky. All right, let's get to work on this presentation. Your dad's groinal area is not gonna draw itself. Now, what kind of scenario do you want? You want, like, a hot tub, a pizza delivery-type thing? Is that... is that my dad? How 'bout, uh, "Museum of Fine Farts"? "Museum of Fine Farts." That's good. But good is the enemy of great. Okay. So let's dig deeper. We can beat it. Yeah, that's your dad with his new Little Eskimo Brother. That's my bully! He's with my bully! Ooh, that's rough. Listen, Ellie, if ever you need to talk about this to anyone, I'd bottle it up instead. No one wants to hear about your problems. I'm gonna kill him! How 'bout "Feces Peanut Butter Cups"? (chuckles) We could do better. Yeah, but you laughed. But did I laugh the right kind of laugh? Well, what do you got, Old Man Ginger? Hey, look who's talkin'. Yeah, what do you got? Well, I... Look, I mean, I figure we should stay in the world of juggling, all right? - Let's just see what other gold is in those hills. - Dad? What are you doing? ! Oh, my God, Ellie, this is not what it looks like, I promise. Busted. (chuckles) You will pay for this, Daddy. You will pay! Keep 'em coming, kid. All right, I'll e-mail you. Ah, another family-enriching day at the EBDBBnB. Get to work! KEVIN: Ms. Pam, we wanted to apologize for missing the fund-raiser. Something... It was awful. Something awful... ...tragic happened. I will pass along your very general apologies to the booster club, but that's not why we're here today. The class gave sex ed presentations, and Ellie's was very interesting. Did either of you help her with it? No. No. God, no. Uh... Unless we were supposed to help her. Were we... were we supposed to help her? 'Cause I think we did then. You know what we did? We supervised, but the work was all hers. That's what we did. Then that's even more disturbing. "Human Sexuality by Ellie MacArthur. Nice. "Sex between consenting adults comes in many forms and varieties." I see no problem with that. Just wait. Okay. (gasps) Oh. "There's sex between a man and woman." Did you do this? No. Taco did this. Is that me? No, I think that's the big-boned lass from the bus. PAM: This is unacceptable. Ellie has a very vivid imagination. Actually, she does not. I've seen her in class. I find her to be underwhelming. Her nickname is "Simply There." She has a dark energy around her. Nothing going on behind the eyes. And I find her to be very dull. Dull, dull, dull. (gasps) Oh, my God. Oh, boy. "And intercourse between a man and man." Oh, wow. Oh! Pete! I suspected this was one of your ex-boyfriends. "Ex"? No. We're still best friends. We talk every day. (clears throat) Kevin. "Be smart about sex!" That's beautiful. It ends on a high note. Look at that rainbow. Are those... choads? Yes, they are choads, and your husband is juggling them. What you're showing me here is science fiction. I don't know anyone that juggles choads. I've seen two criminally insane people juggle choads. I can promise you, ma'am, it's not a laughing matter. I am not a choad juggler. The book tells a different tale. Well, Ellie made it up, okay? Your child does not have the mental capacity to make things up. She is a dullard. I don't even... Is that a real word? What does that mean? That's the first time I've ever heard that word. This is so much worse than my last job. - ( chatter ) - ( man coughing ) (horseneighing) Evening, William. Mutton, potato, and cabbage, sir, with bread. Thank you. Oh, General. The northern post rider said latest he ought to leave for Connecticut is midnight on account of the storm brewing. ( cracks ) (toothclatters) ( crunching ) ( gasps ) Billy: General? Need anything else? Summon the doctor. ♪Hush,hush♪ ♪There'ssnakes inthegarden♪ ♪Soulforsale♪ ♪Bloodon therise♪ ♪Hush,hush♪ ♪Knowthere willcomeaday ♪ ♪Asthey'rehiding inthecoverofnight♪ - ♪ I can't wait anymore ♪ - ♪ Soul for sale ♪ ♪I can'twaitanymore♪ ♪Hush,hush.♪ One more deep breath, please. ( inhales ) No pain? - None. - Good. Very good. You may get dressed. The good news is that physically you're fine. There'snosignoftyphus ortyphoidfever, pneumoniaorscurvy. None of the ailments currently afflicting the camp. There's also no reoccurrence of the malaria from your youth. And you've already had the pox. I suffered from pleurisy as well. It often saps the strength in my voice. Well, percussion has ruled out inflammation of the lungs as well. Any other history of illness I should be aware of? My half-brother Lawrence died from the white plague. - Age at death? - 34. Hmm. Well, based on your symptoms, visionsandsounds ofobjectsnotpresent, I'm forced to conclude that you have developed a case of acute melancholia. It is an ailment that originates not in the body, but in the soul. Now, there are two strains of the malady-- unnatural and natural. The former is caused by demonic possession. Natural melancholy is far more common. It is brought on by a deep moral conflict within the soul. Thisillnesscanbequite severe if not properly treated. How so? In the most extreme cases, the... Yes? The patient succumbs to madness. HisExcellencyshouldget afullnight'srest. Much obliged, Doctor. Doctor. If anyone asks, it wasn't me you came to see. Billy has a pain in his back fromwhenhe was kickedbyahorse. Uh, of course. Yes. I'll brew you that tea and then we'll get-- - Coffee. - Sir? We're going to resolve this matter tonight. We? William, do you know what a moral conflict is? No, sir. It occurs when one's most deeply held convictions do not match one's actions. All right. Prior to my melancholic attack, do you remember what I was doing? You had just sat down to dinner. Yes, and just before that? I came in, set down the plate, and I told you about the northern post rider. Said the latest he can leave camp tonight is midnight. There's a piece of correspondence I have delayed sending for several weeks. It's an execution order. Execution? For who? A royal officer held by our forces. The crime he's committed most certainly merits death. Our Connecticut 5th has been awaiting my instructions for a month. If they do not hear word by tomorrow, they'll assume they have my approval to proceed with the execution. Well, do they or don't they? I don't-- I don't know. Clearly something about this execution order is troubling to me. I must do whatever it takes to resolve it. And you will aid me in this pursuit. Tonight,youare totreatme as an equal. Youareto spareme noquarter. Read this out loud. Let me call back the doctor. He knows better-- No, Thacher knows too much already. You see, a commander who suffers from madness risks the life of every soldier under his command. What we discuss here tonight will determine if I remain in command of these American forces... or if I announce my resignation to Congress. Now go on. "December 6, 1777. Dear General, I am Lieutenant John Chaffee of the Connecticut 5th. As you know, my unit suffered a profound loss whenourCaptainMcCarrey wasmurderedby theenemy. I'mwritingto informyou thatthrough diligentpursuit wewereabletocapture andbringto trial theBritishofficer responsible, MajorEdmundHewlett." No, I will not admit to a crime that I did not commit. I did not skulk into your fort and murder your commander and neither did my men. Remember this? It was inked with our captain's blood. I am innocent, Lieutenant. You have made a grievous error. Cameron, the bag, please. How about this, hmm? Our captain's tongue. - No. No, no, no. - Did you flinch when you cut it from his mouth? Then impaled it on his desk for us to find? No, no, no. Was he alive? Or did you defile his corpse - to strike terror into our hearts? - No, no! A thousand times no! I am an officer and a gentleman, but above all, I'm a child of God. I could never inflict such horror on the body of a man alive or dead. But I did not commit these terrible deeds. Only a demon could enact the scenario you've recounted. - A demon, you say? - Yes, a monster of pure evil. Then renounce it. Cast it out. Confess your crimes before God and salvation will be yours. - Are you mad? - Bastard! Not yet. Not yet. Soon. Major Hewlett, I pronounce you guilty of murder. Please, I swear to God and by all that is holy, I am innocent. I am-- ( groaning ) You don't deserve to wear these or any colors. There are rules! There is common decency. I demand to be treated with decency. - There are rules! - Not for a demon like you. ( whimpering ) So what's the problem? Don't you want this man executed? This is the last report prepared by Major Tallmadge before he departed. It's based on a letter from a female intelligencer on Long Island. Go on. "General Washington, I'm saddened to report that our signal agent in Setauket has written to say that on the 1st of December our man Culper was captured by the royal authorities while on assignment in York City and charged with espionage." Continue. "As far as we know, Culper is still alive and being held at Livingston's sugar house prison." Please, God. Please hear me. Hear me. ( muttering ) I was not open with my family. Man: Woodhull. Go slow or you'll bring it back up. Name's Gareth. And you're Woodhull? I'm Abraham. Father of the Hebrews. Guard: Spread out. Spread out. How did two God-fearing men like ourselves end up in a sugar house? Assaulting a king's officer. Bollocks. All's I did was tell a man to unhand my sister. She's 11. Been like a father to her all her life and now she's got no one. Sorry. What about you? They don't lock up Tories unless it's serious. I was caught somewhere I shouldn't have been caught carrying something I shouldn't have been carrying. Please tell me you're some kind of Nathan Hale. Sticking it to the enemy behind their lines. Give me some reason for hope. No... I'm just one man in the city trying to do something right, that's all. Thank you. Yeah. Guard! Take me to Yates. Mr. Woodhull just confessed he's a spy. (menarguing) Shut up! Shut up, you sordid bastards. He said that one man in the city could do as much damage as 1,000 in the field. - Do not listen to him, sir. He's lying. - Hold your tongue. ( sighs ) Do you have proof? A witness? No, but you said I would go free if I got a confession. Ah, yes, I did. However, it takes more than hearsay to hang a man. Now you're worse than a Tory, Gareth. You're a conk, a snitch. You might not even make it through the night tonight. Take him back. - Let's go. - No! You can't do this! No! No! You enjoy this, don't you, huh? Can I tell you a secret? I don't believe there's a God in heaven nordoIbelieve there'sa Devilin hell. They exist merely in the minds of men. But... when a mind is broken... and a man... ( sniffs ) is stripped down to his base nature... Hmm? Then you can see who he truly is. It will be with great pleasure that I finally meet you, Mr. Woodhull. Get out. Go on! Washington: Of all thedecisionsImake, it is this one which threatens my life and our future. Shall I pardon a brutal murderer in order to save a failed spy? What should I do? You always do the right thing, General. The right thing? Was it right to get Nathaniel Sackett's throat slit? Or-- or to have the king's ledger fall into the hands of Robert Rogers? Was it right to lose the French alliance andtheentirebloodywar? But-- but the war ain't lost. If he could see me now, he'd laugh. He'd already know what to do. He'd have done it. How would he do it? Have a seat, Billy. We're going to stir the proverbial pot. But you can't play whist without four men. Then let there be two Washingtons and two William Lees. My brother Lawrence taught me this game. He used it to order his thoughts. Lawrence introduced me to a world of culture and opportunity. He taught me how to dance. ( laughs ) Sort of a rough country boy. He took me in at Mount Vernon and fashioned me into a gentleman. I recall it was I who watched over him whenwewenttoBarbados wherewehopedtocure histuberculosis. - ( distant choir singing ) - Look in my bag, George. I have something for you. Lawrence, no. This is your pocket watch. I can't have your pocket watch. Yours now. ( coughing ) Bemindfulof time, mybrother. Itcaneasily runout. Billy: Must have meant a hell of a lot to him to give you that watch. I owe him everything. I taught my brother to play, too, soon after we was brought to Mount Vernon. Frank was missing Mama something fierce. Wouldn't stop crying all through the night. So I thought teach him a game. Brighten his spirits. Is Frank any good? Hmm, he ain't better than me. ( chuckles ) I seem to recall the Good Book mentioned something about pride coming before destruction. You're right. Sorry, General. I'm pulling your leg, Billy. Have another drink. Barbados rum is the finest. Counting them cards. Good memory. I owe my memory to my days as chief surveyor of Culpeper County. Another debt I owe Lawrence. Culpeper. That sound like Culper. Abraham Woodhull. That's his real name. His father is a county magistrate and a Loyalist. And he has a wife and a young son. His older brother was a captain in the king's American regiment, but he died suddenly, tragically. And so the second son became the first. Just like you. I am nothing like Abraham Woodhull. No, General, you sure ain't nothing like him. If you have something to say, say it. All I meant to say was that you seem just fine to me. Dr. Thacher probably making too much of nothing. Youstrongas an ox . You just having a bad night is all. It's not just one night. This has been happening for weeks. I'm hearing things, seeing things. Seeing Lawrence. No, this malady is real, and I'm not going to let it beat me. ( pounds table ) I'm going to fight and I'm going to win. And I'll be damned if I allow you to deny me that. - Deny you? - I told you to give me no quarter, but you're throwing the game, hiding behind lies. You think I don't see you counting cards, too? Clean up this mess. No. No horseshit. That's what you asked for. Till midnight, you clean up your own mess. Less than two hours till the post rider must leave with my answer. Remember, give me no quarter. You're playing your two hands with completely different stratagems. I imagine one's Frank and one's me. Why? 'Cause there ain't two Billy Lees. You need to figure out if you got two Abe Woodhulls. A spy and a double. To figure that out, you gotta play Abe's hand. Woodhull hasn't broken. How do you know? Because he hasn't been executed. If he had, we'd have read it in their gazettes. For a lawful execution to take place, one requires sufficient evidence. Right, and without evidence you gotta get a confession. Mmm. Despite whatever miseries they've heaped upon him, Woodhull hasn't succumbed. Neither did the other one. - The other one? - Major Hewlett. He didn't confess neither, did he? No, indeed. Which is why Chaffee sent the second letter. December 18th. 14 days ago. "Your Excellency, it has been two weeks since I wrote to you. We tried Major Hewlett and found him guilty. Even though he refuses to confess, there is no doubt he is lying. All I require is permission to see justice done and Major Hewlett executed. I appreciate that you have countless decisions to make, but with respect, we have waited long enough." ( wind howling ) Now, where were we? Aries? No, Perseus. Yes, do you see it? Thebrightstarthere iscalledAlgol. It is Arabic for demon. That's quite fitting, really, because Perseus slew a demon. Medusa. Her gaze turned men to stone. But Perseus, he saved her. Just like I saved you from Simcoe. Anna. Andromeda. Yousee,we arefated. (doorunlocks) Oh, no, not yet. Not by me. You see, I'm still waiting on the order. But you don't have to. I'm going to leave this here. You can try to end yourself. Or maybe you'll make things interesting and run for the trees. You never know when you'll find the door unlocked. (doorcloses) No. ( muttering ) No, no, no. No! ( whimpering ) Maybe I did do it. Did I do it? Maybe I did do it. Maybe I did do it. Was it me? Maybe I did do it. Maybe I did. Maybe I am a demon. A demon. De-- demon. Simcoe. So decisions get made with or without you? Yes. If I want Hewlett's life spared, tonight's post is my final opportunity. - Your play. - This is ridiculous. - Beg pardon? - Gambling isn't medicine. This is vice. Lawrence would never waste time playing games with a servant. He would serve justice and execute Hewlett. Just 'cause Lawrence protected you don't mean you gotta try and be him. Watch yourself. Whoo. What I tell you? That brother of yours must have had a really bad hand. ( choking ) Never speak of my brother again. ( coughing ) ( crying ) And how was your dinner, darling? Exquisite. There was pork, venison, beef, and rabbit. And a lovely claret to wash it all down. How about yours, dear? Oh, we had all that plus a couple of quince pies for dessert. ( laughing ) You know what I wish? That I wasn't topping' your mother? ( laughing ) Toppin' your mother! (laughing) Soldier: The old warhorse just takes it instead of hanging that redcoat what murdered McCarrey in Connecticut. (mengrunting) What's he afraid of? (mengrunting) Soldier #2: Yeah? Well, my mother has the clap, so you two are perfect for each other. ( laughing ) Soldier: What'sheafraidof? I am not afraid. Anna. Fight, Abraham. Fight. Yates: Woodhull! - ( door creaks ) - ( coughing ) Yates: Happy New Year, Mr. Woodhull. You have a visitor. (dooropens) ( Abe coughing ) Go. ( coughing ) How much did you pay Yates for this visit? That's not important. I wanted to see you and to bring you something that will help. You took your time. I was busy making sure your wife and child were safe. You know Major Hewlett has been abducted from Whitehall with Mary and Anna Strong and myself held at gunpoint? ( coughs ) Anna? What was Anna doing there? It's for her protection since Simcoe returned. - Simcoe? - Yes. ( coughing ) ( coughing continues ) - What's he done to her? - Abraham-- - Tell me what he's done to her! - She's Simcoe's now! Half the town saw her kissing him in broad daylight on the tavern green. But you stand here accused of treason and all you can think to ask me about is Anna Strong? After all this time, you haven't learned a thing. I spent night after night wondering why you would do this. Why would you write a letter incriminating yourself? And there was my answer. You wanted to be caught. You know what you're doing is wrong. You really travelled all this way just to lecture me? I'm not lect-- ( groans, shouts ) ( exhales ) But you know what? I have learned my lesson in regard to you. You will not listen to reason and you won't stop on your own. So perhaps this is the safest place for you, at least until this war is over. Hmm? Is that what you want? To stay here? To rot? Answer me! Ah, you...! You know, you're right about one thing. As long as I have air in my lungs, I will never, ever stop. ( wind howling ) Lawrence? What is all this? This war, was it a mistake? Was it greed? Is that what you're trying to tell me? Answer me, damn you! I have done everything you ever taught me. I tamed my temper, became a gentleman. I sought opportunity. I've climbed and clawed and fought and now I'm respected, feared, hated, and worshipped. But for what? I am not who they think I am. Oh, for the love of God, say something. Please. As always, you ask what I would do and I will tell you what I would not. I would never spare a murderer. Nor lose Long Island. Nor retreat at White Plains. Nor be outflanked at Brandywine. Nor crossed the Delaware on Christmas night... to claim a surprise victory. Nor led a campaign against the mightiest empire on Earth. But then again... I am not you. ( wind howling ) Man: Post rider for the commander. - Guard: All right, go on in. -( sniffles) The general ain't here. Don't know when he'll be back. Do you have his letter? No, sir. It's half midnight. The storm is churning up. If I wait much longer, I might could get stuck. If you need to go, go. Wait. Best you hold post. Check back at midnight. I require fresh paper. Would you be needing anything else, General? No. Thank you... William. Washington's voice: "DearestLieutenantChaffee, Iwishto staythe execution ofMajorEdmundHewlett." ( wind whistling ) "He'llbetradedback totheBritishinexchange forseveralvaluableofficers ofthehighestrank andimportance tothearmy. Ioffermy deepestregret thatI cannot providejustice forCaptainMcCarrey atthistime. Butallowme toassureyou thatsparing MajorHewlett willsavethelives ofourcountrymen.

( gunshot ) - ( men shouting ) - ( gunshots ) ( shouts ) (gunshots,shouting continue) Happy New Year, Major. Oh, dear, what have they done to you? It looks like a little oyster. - You killed their captain. - I did? You cast the blame on me. To be fair, I thought these rebels would have put you out of my misery right away. Seeing you like this, though, is a welcome surprise. ( groans ) ( shouts ) ( both shout ) ( screaming ) - Where is Hewlett? - Save your strength. Mark his grave. We'll say he was dead before we arrived. He ain't dead now. He will be. (thememusicplaying) Previously on TURN: Washington's Spies. It appears your son Abraham has been arrested as a spy. All right I wrote the letter. Write to Major Hewlett. He's the target. He'll corroborate every word that I've said. Your Major Hewlett was kidnapped by rebels, the same night that you were caught. If you were able to rescue the Major, I would be deeply in your debt. It does not feel compelled to free an alleged murderer on behalf of a failed spy. Abe isn't just Abe. He's Culper. __ Evening, William. Mutton, potato, and cabbage, sir, with bread. Thank you. Oh, General.

Remember, give me no quarter. You're playing your two hands with completely different stratagems. I imagine one's Frank and one's me. Why? 'Cause there ain't two Billy Lees. You need to figure out if you got two Abe Woodhulls. A spy and a double. To figure that out, you gotta play Abe's hand. Woodhull hasn't broken. How do you know? Because he hasn't been executed. If he had, we'd have read it in their gazettes. For a lawful execution to take place, one requires sufficient evidence. Right, and without evidence you gotta get a confession. Mmm. Despite whatever miseries they've heaped upon him, Woodhull hasn't succumbed. Neither did the other one. - The other one? - Major Hewlett. He didn't confess neither, did he? No, indeed. Which is why Chaffee sent the second letter. December 18th. 14 days ago. "Your Excellency, it has been two weeks since I wrote to you. We tried Major Hewlett and found him guilty. Even though he refuses to confess, there is no doubt he is lying. All I require is permission to see justice done and Major Hewlett executed. I appreciate that you have countless decisions to make, but with respect, we have waited long enough." Now, where were we? Aries? No, Perseus. Yes, do you see it? The bright star there is called Algol. It is Arabic for demon. That's quite fitting, really, because Perseus slew a demon. Medusa. Her gaze turned men to stone. But Perseus, he saved her. Just like I saved you from Simcoe. Anna. Andromeda. You see, we are fated. Oh, no, not yet. Not by me. You see, I'm still waiting on the order. But you don't have to. I'm going to leave this here. You can try to end yourself. Or maybe you'll make things interesting and run for the trees. You never know when you'll find the door unlocked. No. No, no, no. No! Maybe I did do it. Maybe I did do it. Was it me? Maybe I did do it. Maybe I did. Maybe I am a demon. A demon. De... demon. Simcoe. So decisions get made with or without you? Yes. If I want Hewlett's life spared, tonight's post is my final opportunity. - Your play. - This is ridiculous. - Beg pardon? - Gambling isn't medicine. This is vice. Lawrence would never waste time playing games with a servant. He would serve justice and execute Hewlett. Just 'cause Lawrence protected you don't mean you gotta try and be him. Watch yourself. Whoo. What I tell you? That brother of yours must have had a really bad hand. Never speak of my brother again. And how was your dinner, darling? Exquisite. There was pork, venison, beef, and rabbit. And a lovely claret to wash it all down. How about yours, dear? Oh, we had all that plus a couple of quince pies for dessert. You know what I wish? That I wasn't topping' your mother? Toppin' your mother! Soldier: The old warhorse just takes it instead of hanging that redcoat what murdered McCarrey in Connecticut. What's he afraid of? Soldier ♪2: Yeah? Well, my mother has the clap, so you two are perfect for each other. Soldier: What's he afraid of? I am not afraid. Anna. Fight, Abraham. Fight. Yates: Woodhull! Yates: Happy New Year, Mr. Woodhull. You have a visitor. Go. How much did you pay Yates for this visit? That's not important. I wanted to see you and to bring you something that will help. You took your time. I was busy making sure your wife and child were safe. You know Major Hewlett has been abducted from Whitehall with Mary and Anna Strong and myself held at gunpoint? Anna? What was Anna doing there? It's for her protection since Simcoe returned. - Simcoe? - Yes. - What's he done to her? - Abraham... - Tell me what he's done to her! - She's Simcoe's now! Half the town saw her kissing him in broad daylight on the tavern green. But you stand here accused of treason and all you can think to ask me about is Anna Strong? After all this time, you haven't learned a thing. I spent night after night wondering why you would do this. Why would you write a letter incriminating yourself? And there was my answer. You wanted to be caught. You know what you're doing is wrong. You really travelled all this way just to lecture me? I'm not lect... But you know what? I have learned my lesson in regard to you. You will not listen to reason and you won't stop on your own. So perhaps this is the safest place for you, at least until this war is over. Hmm? Is that what you want? To stay here? To rot? Answer me! Ah, you...! You know, you're right about one thing. As long as I have air in my lungs, I will never, ever stop. Lawrence? What is all this? This war, was it a mistake? Was it greed? Is that what you're trying to tell me? Answer me, damn you! I have done everything you ever taught me. I tamed my temper, became a gentleman. I sought opportunity. I've climbed and clawed and fought and now I'm respected, feared, hated, and worshipped. But for what? I am not who they think I am. Oh, for the love of God, say something. Please. As always, you ask what I would do and I will tell you what I would not. I would never spare a murderer. Nor lose Long Island. Nor retreat at White Plains. Nor be outflanked at Brandywine. Nor crossed the Delaware on Christmas night... to claim a surprise victory. Nor led a campaign against the mightiest empire on Earth. But then again... I am not you. Man: Post rider for the commander. Guard: All right, go on in. The general ain't here. Don't know when he'll be back. Do you have his letter? No, sir. It's half midnight. The storm is churning up. If I wait much longer, I might could get stuck. If you need to go, go. Wait. Best you hold post. Check back at midnight. I require fresh paper. Would you be needing anything else, General? No. Thank you... William. Washington's voice: "Dearest Lieutenant Chaffee, I wish to stay the execution of Major Edmund Hewlett." "He'll be traded back to the British in exchange for several valuable officers of the highest rank and importance to the army. I offer my deepest regret that I cannot provide justice for Captain McCarrey at this time. But allow me to assure you that sparing Major Hewlett will save the lives of our countrymen. It is of extreme importance that he survive." "This decision was mine, but was not made alone. I have consulted with valued confidants, top men whom I trust with my own life. This has been a difficult winter for us all, but we'll survive it. We will prevail." Pardon Hewlett? What... I'll finish Hewlett. You lot take the rest. Happy New Year, Major. Oh, dear, what have they done to you? It looks like a little oyster. - You killed their captain. - I did? You cast the blame on me. To be fair, I thought these rebels would have put you out of my misery right away. Seeing you like this, though, is a welcome surprise. - Where is Hewlett? - Save your strength. Mark his grave. We'll say he was dead before we arrived. He ain't dead now. He will be. BARBIE: Three weeks ago, an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world. The dome has tested our limits... - (screams) - Go! Pitting us against one another. Chester's Mill sentences Dale Barbara to death. And forcing each of us to confront our own personal demons... rage... I need to know that you will stand with me against that! Grief... JOE: I don't understand... who could do this to her? I promise you, we're going to catch whoever did this. - Fear... - We're trapped. WOMAN: I hear we're going to run out of water. (clamoring) (screaming) You killed Angie McAlister. Shame. I thought it would bring the dome down. I would do anything to take it back. But we've also found love under the dome. (muffled explosion) And we have battled to keep our town together. I thought the dome was supposed to protect us. No, it's up to us to protect each other. Now we may finally have found a way out. We're outside the dome. We hope it takes us home, but what if it takes us to an alternate reality? BEN: Whatever's going down in Chester's Mill, here's proof that it ain't real. BARBIE: These places... these people... something is wrong here. What do you say, Red? Do it. (grunting with effort) MAN: You okay? Okay, stay close. Watch your step. Here, use your legs. I got you. Come here, don't put too much weight on it. (various people speaking quietly) (low humming, buzzing) (all groaning with disappointment) MAN: Is this a joke? (everyone murmuring, talking indistinctly) MAN: So what are we gonna do now? WOMAN: I'm getting so tired of this... ♪ MAN 2: It's all right. It's gonna be all right. MAN 3: I just can't take this anymore. .: Modifié par M0uSe :. We walked into the white light... and we just kept going. And the dome was gone. And we were free. The outside world, somehow it seemed more... more beautiful, you know, more vibrant. Where was I? You were dead. What did you do after I died? Julia... I want to know what it was like for you. There was a funeral, and I met your parents. The only thing I could do was to get as far away from Chester's Mill as possible. Where'd you go? Abuja. Kabul. I ran rescue missions. I dreamt about you every night. Hey, it's okay. I met a woman. Oh. She doesn't matter. None of it was real. What happened to your neck? Your father came back. He brought the egg. - My father did that? - No. (sighs) Don's dead. How? I think Melanie killed him. How could you even say that? Because she tried to kill me, too. Found this in an emergency kit. You should eat something. Come on home. That's your home, not mine. Course it's yours. I-I don't know how I'm back here. You were in some kind of a-a, a-a cocoon, - and-and... you never went anywhere. - I did. I moved on. I got rid of you. This time has to be different, Dad. I want to forgive you. - For what? - All of it. Locking me up in that bomb shelter, alone, in the dark. Leaving me up in that tree, forcing me to go get the belt. I saved you. You should be thanking me. You were a weak little kid. I just tried to make you strong. I was stronger without you. Where? ! In your little make-believe cocoon world? You're still weak. You're pathetic and afraid. You can punch that dome as many times as you need to, Junior. You're back under it. Three weeks. That's how long you and I were in those cocoons. Oh, my God. I know. Christine... the last thing I remember was us finding that egg. And then I was in an alternate reality for, like, a year. In love with Dale, carrying his child. And now we've hatched and we're under a dome? None of this makes sense. We're anthropologists. But in that world, I was an aid worker. You-you were a therapist. Why were we different? I can't tell you that, but... I think it's a good thing. If this town knew who we really are, that we were here to find that egg, we'd have a lot more to answer for. All those hunts Hektor sent us on, do you think Aktaion knew what would happen when we found one? Tomorrow we'll go to that town hall meeting - and find out what we can. - No, I'm... I can't see Dale. With her. We have to go. People saw us in those caves. If we don't show up, they'll come looking. Is it possible I'm pregnant? I don't Yeah. Whenever I think of Hawaii, I think of Taro, right? Oh, yeah, I've gotta have some poi. What if we make the Taro the chips, and then make something else the poi? I gotta say, whenever I think of Hawaii, Spam always comes to mind. That really salty, delicious meat? Yeah, yeah, totally. - Jarrid: The mystery canned meat? - Mystery canned meat. - Spam dip! - Yes. Robyn: Spam, yeah. Um, what else? Lomi lomi salmon? Lomi lomi, like a tartar? Yeah, you don't cook it. Sounds good. There's that opihi, right? Opihi. It is a delicacy, yeah. - I love that stuff out there. - Que es opihi? Opihi is shellfish, basically, but it's a barnacle. I think that we need some meat on the menu. - Short ribs. - If we take the short rib idea, and then maybe, like, a hibachi or like a teppenyaki, and just cook the short ribs real quick, just flash it. Awesome. A pigs a little too traditional for us. What about volcanoes? What if we could cook with some lava? You know what? I can build volcanoes that erupt sauce, and it's edible. Yeah, perfect. I think it'd be cool if we had something that looked like a coconut, and tasted like a coconut, and we could call it the fauxconut. That is genius. Bravo, my friend. - Yeah. - That sounds good. I'm kind of liking this menu. We've got all these amazing Hawaiian ingredients. This party's unusual because no one's coming in for a tasting, and it's all on me to make sure that we get everything right. And this is also one of the most complicated menus we've tried yet. We're gonna try to execute the taro chips and poi, cook the short ribs on hot rocks table side, make an opihi poke, an amadai lomi lomi, and lastly, we're gonna make the fauxconut. Robyn, what I want us to do is utilize these beautiful shells. For the opihi poke, I want to incorporate all of the traditional ingredients, but utilizing new techniques. For the opihi, I'll use real opihi shells as a mold to make a version that's edible. I'll paint them with edible clay. When the clay dries, I'll pry them apart and put the real opihi into the newly formed shell. And then, for the tuna poke, my idea is to freeze the tuna and shave it on a shaved ice machine, which will give the texture of tuna snow. And then I'll place it on a bed of wakame, and diced Asian pears. The only problem is I've never used a shaved ice machine before, but I want to do it because it's really popular in Hawaii and at luaus. So, what we want to do is make a mixture of these three ingredients right here. We have kaolin. It's like an edible clay. And milk powder. And this is just dashi, to emphasize that fish flavor. When we combine these three ingredients together, We're gonna go ahead and make, like, an edible shell. Ooh, very cool. And we'll make it out of these opihi shells. As soon as you make the mixture, I'm gonna come back, and we'll go ahead and make some of the edible shells together. - Fantastic. - All right, sweet. Jarrid, can you put a rock in the oven? Essentially, we want, like, the short ribs to kind of like finish cooking tableside on the rocks. I'm testing different types of rocks, including the one I found on the beach, to see which one works the best. In order to cook the short ribs on these rocks, I need to get the rocks up to 500 degrees, so I've placed some of them on top of the burners so they get hot enough. - [bang] - Oh, [bleep]. My rock just exploded all over the place. Robyn: Holy-- Not so good. That's not gonna work. [groans] Robyn: Ooh, that sucks. Marcel: This could be the first complete and total failure inside the quantum kitchen. This [bleep]. I'm so [bleep] stressed out about this party. - [bang] - Oh, [bleep]. Holy-- My rock just exploded all over the place. - Did it split? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. - Yeah, that just blew up. So that's not gonna work. I'm testing different types of rocks, including the one I found on the beach, to see which one works the best. In order to cook the short ribs on these rocks, I need to get the rocks up to 500 degrees, but unfortunately, these rocks can't be heated up to 500 degrees without exploding. I put some in the oven, and maybe we can experiment with that. I put these in when it was low heat, so it's coming up with the heat, so maybe that will-- With the heat, it won't shock 'em, and hopefully they won't explode. Hopefully. We gotta make sure that it doesn't explode when we put the short ribs on it, too. Jarrid: I decided to try the quarry rock because it's less porous and it retains it's heat a lot better. All right, I'm just gonna pull this stone out. Oh God, that's hot. Oh God, oh God, oh dear, oh dear. Ah, yeah. Look at that, smoke coming off the towel. I think we're gonna hear some searing. [sizzles] - That thing did not crack. - And it smells delicious. So, we have to think about something here. Are the guests going to be able to pick this off the rock? Is this really safe? I think they can take on food with instructions. This is withstanding temperature really well. - It's not exploding. - Not exploding. That's a good thing. Marcel: I have finally actually found a rock that is not only able to withstand these temperatures, but also retain that internal temperature, thereby allowing me to cook the short rib all the way through. - So, for the pineapple sauce? - Yes. The pineapple sauce is going to be erupting out of the volcano? Yes. I bought this pump to try it out with. I'm gonna build the volcano around this, it's gonna shoot out the top, and come running down into-- And should we have a reservoir that goes all the way arnd, so people on both sides can kind of, like, eat? - Sounds ambitious? - It is. This volcano is gonna be pretty bad ass. - Are you gonna try to peel that off? - Yeah. Robyn: We're trying to paint a kaolin clay mixture on these opihi shells, and after it bakes, we peel it off, and hopefully it looks just like an opihi shell Ahh. Oh, man. The shell business is not working out so well. It's not that it won't go on, it's just that it won't stay on. Every single time I painted on these dang shells, the clay just melted right off, and I am frustrated. Okay, let me see. I'm trying, Marcel's trying. We're pouring it on there, and it just bleeds right off. I have not had a successful shell. We've gotta make this work. I don't know. I really don't know what to [bleep] do here. Man, it's just running right off. What if we tried corn starch or something on the Saran wrap ? Maybe it would stick a little better, you think? You think that we're gonna have any problem getting these off here? I don't know, that's why I added the oil. This time I wrapped the opihi shells in Saran wrap, and then I put a very, very little bit of oil on the top, dipped it in corn starch, and then I painted on the edible clay. It looks like it's working. Just when I'm starting to feel as though we're not gonna be able to make this happen, that's when Robyn comes up with the idea of dipping them in corn starch, so that way our clay mixture actually adheres to the opihi shells. I think that that corn starch was exactly what we needed in this whole situation. - Yeah. - That totally worked, and was a brilliant idea, and Robyn is totally killing it. Go ahead and pop those in the oven. - Absolutely. - At 220? Robyn: These guys are going in. Did you make the pineapple sauce? I did. This is it right here. Do you think this might be too thick to go through the pump? I don't know. There's only one way to find out. I want to create a volcano that erupts pineapple saffron sauce to go with the short ribs. And the volcano is gonna be the centerpiece on the table. It's going. It's slowly making it's way to the top. I think it might be clogged. Can't tell. [Marcel laughs] The vibe in the kitchen's good. Marcel's not being a [bleep], and we're able to joke around and still get some stuff done, and things are starting to get back to normal. We gotta make sure that we don't get the guests dirty. Yeah, well, we can turn it down. Take two. See, that's not bad. Oh, yeah, that's what we want, right there. Now that we've got the pump figured out, Jarrid just has to actually construct something that resembles a volcano. So, now that we've baked the opihi shells, we take them out of the oven, now we just need to see and hope and pray it tastes okay. Let's try one of these. I don't know how you guys feel about this, but I just don't like it. They're gonna try it, and they'll be, like, "Ooh, that sucks. Damn." The seashells taste like when you're surfing, and you, like, eat it face first into the sand, and your whole mouth is full of water and sand. That's what it tastes like. I'm thinking this could be the first complete and total failure inside the quantum kitchen. This [bleep]. Look at these volcanoes. They're dry, I can start carving 'em here. So, it's day two of prep, and we have to make all of the components for all of the dishes, plus the volcano centerpiece. We want to erupt pineapple sauce up and out of the volcano. And it'll have some gaps in it, which is good. If you look inside, you can see where it's thinner, or where there's some holes. All I did was take bowls, and I wrapped them in cellophane, and then I used expansion foam. It's a construction type of foam that gets hard enough to where I can carve it. But I still have a lot more to do if I'm gonna make this thing a volcano. And light up, and blow smoke. I'm just too ambitious. All right. Looks like you've got a lot of work cut out for you. Opihi take two. I need to go back to the drawing board with this entire concept. They don't meet our quality standards, right? I essentially threw out the idea of making a clay shell, and instead have decided to go with a cracker shell, which I think will not only look, but also taste better. And we'll still use the opihi shell as a mold. What I'm thinking is to actually have two different colors. Like the two different colors you actually get on the shell. Maybe add some kelp powder, right? Kind of a very opihi-ish. A little bit of squid ink. - Get it, baby. - I kind of like that, actually. - Like the nice marble, kind of? - Yeah. I'm just really nervous because I spent an entire day without creating one shell. I'm really hoping that this new idea will work. - Test it all, test it all. - I'm testing it. Okay, I just want to start over. I'm working on trying to create a trail on these volcanoes that the sauce can follow. I thought this would be simpler, but with the time crunch, it's just a lot more complicated than I thought it was gonna be. The base of the volcano looks great. Yeah, but that doesn't mean [bleep]. If it doesn't erupt, it's [bleep] pointless. Wait, it's not gonna erupt? I have a vision in my head, but I keep doing the wrong thing to make that vision happen. This looks just like crap to me. As soon as this pineapple sauce comes out, it's just gonna be running down these tubes that are hanging down the side of a mountain? That doesn't make any sense. When have you ever seen a volcano with tubes coming out to direct the lava? What if it was made out of bamboo or something? Like, a little bamboo ramp or something? I don't know. That would look tacky, too. Who puts a bamboo ramp up against a volcano? It's becoming abundantly clear that we may have some issues with this volcano, and this is the centerpiece for the party, so we've gotta get this thing working. Never fear, man. There's one thing my brain is able to do, is in the heat of the moment, come up with another idea. So, Robyn, what's going on with those edible shells? We can check 'em and see what's up with them. So, this is our new cracker base here. I'm hoping Robyn's edible opihi cracker actually works, because if not, we're totally screwed on this one. It's pretty cool that, you know, the outside now looks a little bit more like it came from the ocean. [bleep] hot. See if it actually works. Oh, my God, it's beautiful. It's pretty cool. Yeah, I really like the inside. And these, I think, have such a cool appearance, and such an amazing texture. I mean, you can actually see the grooves. - Let's check the flavor. - Okay. It's super-buttery, nice and salty. I've got that kelp flavor. Love it. Thank God that actually works. [giggles] - All right. - Finally-- I feel much better about this. We actually solved it. I don't know about you, but I was losing sleep over this. I was, too. - How's it going, coconut? - Good. For the fauxconut, I want to make something that resembles a coconut, but isn't actually a coconut. I'm going to try taking a coconut ice cream base, and load that inside of a balloon, and then roll that balloon over liquid nitrogen, to form a frozen sphere of coconut cream. I'll then peel off the balloon, and dust cocoa powder over the sphere to create the fauxconut. I want the dish to look like a coconut just fell right out of the tree and onto the beach. So for the fauxconut, we're going to put our coconut ice cream base inside of the balloon-- Stop, stop, stop. Okay. Pull the trigger. Blow up with nitrous oxide. Stop. Drop inside of the nitrogen, roll it around, and hope that it creates a circle. Jarrid: I think that thing's gonna shrink up. Marcel: All right, let's see what happens. The idea here is that as I'm rolling the balloon through the nitrogen, the liquid is staying on the bottom and also freezing simultaneously. It looks like something's going on here. Not so good. Devon: It's kind of imploding. That's what I was thinking it was gonna do. Marcel: That's totally crumbling. How's it taste, though? - Tastes [bleep] really good. - Devon: It's delicious. All right, let's try it again. Jarrid: All right. So how many of these do we have to make? Devon: Fifteen, right? How many have we made so far? Zero. So we learned two things when making the fuaxconuts, one of which is you need to make sure you have enough ice cream base inside the balloon to actually create a sphere. And then the other thing was that if you poke the balloon with a needle halfway through the freezing process, it prevents it from compressing on top of itself. - Robyn: Yay. - We got one. Marcel: We're able to execute one perfect coconut balloon. This is the beginning of the fauxconut, yeah? Devon: Yeah. So we want to take this fauxconut and inject it with our coconut cream, right? Filling this with that. Doesn't really look like it's gonna work, though. Marcel: The fauxconut is nowhere near completion, and the balloon technique is so time consuming. Obviously, we have a lot of work to do with this dessert, not to mention all of the other dishes. I didn't even have the time to test out the amadai lomi lomi, or the taro chips, and Jarrid's volcano still is not working. We haven't even finished testing, let alone prepping. Honestly, we're gonna be up all night working on this menu. I'm so [bleep] stressed out about this party. And are we ready? Marcel: Every single dish is plated with multiple components. How many have you made so far? One. Marcel: Things are gonna be freezing, melting. Go for it. Are you serious? This volcano looked like elephant dung. Marcel: Okay, we literally have to go to plan B. Can I get an ETA? This is complete chaos. Marcel: Welcome to Walden Surf shop, guys. Oh, look at all this sand. Nice. The actually did it, huh? Walking into the surf shop the day of the party, there's literally six tons of sand on the ground. It looks pretty cool. Marcel: Let's find the kitchen. Robyn: Cookin' outside this time. It's tiny. Devon: Another makeshift kitchen. I'm extremely nervous about my team coming together, because when you're working in small kitchens, it can be kind of stressful. We really struggled at the last event and we can't afford to do that again. This party, the main thing that we want to focus in on is organization, execution, and communication. Let's do work, girls. All right, let's do it. The big challenge with our edible opihi shells is they're so fragile that I could have opened up the box and seen just crackers everywhere. But they were beautiful. Oh, they look so pretty. So I was up all night and I was working on the volcanoes, and it's turning into a nightmare. I never want to see a volcano again. I mean, it's getting to the point where I just want to smash this and throw it away. No wonder kids fail Science all the time when they have to do science projects. It sucks. - Hey, Marcel. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. How are you? - Good to see you. - Good to see you, too. Marcel: So the volcano's right over here. This is what we call operation Jarrid versus the volcano. This looks scary. I'm thinking to myself, praying, that I'm being punked, because I'm thinking there's no way that they could possibly think that that thing is gonna look good on any table, let alone a gorgeous luau table that I'm creating for Steve Walden. What-- what's gonna happen with that, exactly, just so I know where the guests should sit? Awesome. Glad you asked that. Okay. If we could somehow leave this space where the actual lava will come down. Is that hot sauce coming down or it's cold? It's liquid hot magma. We'll tone it down to where nobody gets splattered with it, and if they did, it wouldn't burn them. Are you serious? Hold on. Okay, this sounds dangerous, like it could spout out pineapple sauce onto the guests. So I'll leave you two to that, and I'll just exit stage left. How is that gonna look visually appealing? You know, maybe we should tell the guests that the dress code is retardant casual. Robyn: All right. Can I help you with your chips and dip? Devon: Yeah. Basically, I'm making a Spam puree, soaked in some cream and milk, which will pull out some of that salt, and then it'll be nice and smooth as a little first course dip. - We need the stencil for the surf boards. - All right. Devon: Spam is all over Hawaii, so we're doing a Spam poi to do a play on the original Hawaiian poi. But instead of doing a taro root puree, we're doing actual taro chips. Go for it. Devon: Now we're starting to make 'em look like cool little surf boards to dip into our Spam poi. Robyn: That's fantastic. It looks really good. [bleep] Robyn: Jarrid's volcanoes, these are supposed to be the big, huge theatrical moments of the party, and he's running out of time to get it right. Is this all we have? Yeah. Marcel: We have to make a bunch more. Robyn: Oh, my God. I'm stressin' about those damn volcanoes. - Yeah. - Robyn: Just sayin'. Go ahead and go for it. - Jarrid: Really? - Marcel: Jarrid, is it working? Jarrid: Dammit. This one is spraying all over the place. Honestly, look at the situation. I don't know if I'm gonna pull this off. Marcel: What is all the red stuff? It's edible ink. Doesn't look very edible. As a backup plan, I'm gonna make another batch of pineapple sauce so just in case the volcano doesn't work, I'll still be able to plate my short ribs. Oh, my God. I'm gonna work on the amadai. Marcel: This is my first time preparing the amadai lomi lomi because I ran out of time in the test kitchen. And cutting through the scales is... not something you really want to do a lot of. Amadai has tiny, edible scales, and when they come into contact with hot oil, it creates a chemical reaction explosion. And that explosion propels the scales up, making them super crispy and delicious. - Holy crap. - Okay. Jarrid: Where are we putting this now, exactly? I made two, one for this side, one for this side. There are two coming? Yeah. He's got two. Okay, not one volcano, two volcanoes. Only one volcano will work on the table. Jarrid: When it was brought up to her, I could tell Antoinette wasn't into those volcanoes at all. I'm gonna go grab the other one. Not happy. This is a [bleep] nightmare, dude. I'm gonna try to stay calm. Okay. Jarrid: We need two volcanoes. I would like one volcano on the table. Jarrid: You can't have 15 guests trying to get pineapple sauce from one volcano. So I wasn't gonna take, no, it's not going on the table for an answer. At this point, if we just wrap it in the bottoms with banana leaves or do whatever we're gonna do-- Right. All right. Let's go. Two volcanoes. 'Cause that's the easiest thing with our time. Yeah. So... Antoinette: Aleta. We need to-- we need to figure this out. This is the ugliest thing I have ever seen. Respectfully, I say that. Antoinette: This volcano looked like elephant dung. Steve: Oh, my God. Brandy: It's really important to me that Steve gets the celebration that he deserves. Oh, my gosh. Look at it. Wow. This is incredible. And so I want everything about this party to be special. Steve: I'm just absolutely amazed. It's total Hawaii. How are you? Woman: This looks amazing. - Brandy: Isn't that cool? - Steve: Yeah, it is. I'm afraid to touch anything. - Antoinette: Hey, Marcel. - Marcel: Yes? Antoinette: Steve and Brandy are here, we're kind of running a little bit behind. - We looking' okay? - Marcel: Five minutes. Marcel: We have rare and perishable ingredients from all over the world that we can't mess up. Oh, my God. Marcel: I'm a little nervous about the shaved ice machine to make the frozen tuna snow. Not only have I never used it before, but I'm doing it tableside. - Are we ready? - Antoinette: We are so ready. Marcel: On top of that, every single dish is plated with multiple components and different textures and temperatures. Things are gonna be freezing, melting. This is the most ambitious menu my team has ever tried to execute. Welcome. Good evening. I hope you guys enjoy the chips and dip. They're made out of taro, one of the most predominant vegetables from Hawaii. And then the dip is actually the Spam poi. It's kind of a little fun plate. Did you guys try that? No? My first initial reaction is, like, holy [bleep]. The guests missed the entire first course. Well, feel free to try it now. There should be some chips and dip. Marcel: We had decided to have them sitting out on the table, but the guests didn't get it. Clearly, that was a mistake, and I'm totally stressed out because already I'm afraid this party is off to a bad start. That's good. For your next course, we actually have our-- our version of poke, and it's actually gonna be a tuna shaved ice poke. Right down the middle you have ponzu fluid gels. Over on the other side, we have the opihi, and the shells are edible. This is big eye tuna from the Big Island. So first, the guests missed the first course. And now it sounds like Marcel's chopping up a body in an ice machine. This is awesome. Awesome. MarcelLet me do the first one, then you can follow my lead. Nice and sexy, yeah? Probably one of the best ways to eat this is to maybe just smash it and mix it all up. And mix all the ingredients together. Have a little fun with it and just, hopefully, enjoy. Steve: Wow, this looks so neat. I loved the edible shells. I was a little nervous because I thought we were gonna be eating shells, but delicious. Gosh. Everything tastes so good. Antoinette: For each dish, timing is very, very important. Brandy has a surprise for Steve. He hasn't met his grandson yet, it's a little baby, and so his daughter is flying in with the grandson to the event. So there is a time factor, and I'm- - I'm very concerned. Marcel: Okay, start plating. Fire up the pans. Do we have oil? Anybody? Robyn: There is oil here somewhe. [bleep] kidding me. It's gonna be a [bleep] show. This is complete chaos. We can't find the frying oil for the lomi lomi. Antoinette: What's happened? Marcel: I can't fry the fish without oil. Marcel: If we don't find this oil, we're not gonna be able to cook the fish to get the next course out. Robyn: No, dude, I know that there is oil. Jarrid: We [bleep] need it, like, right[bleep] now. I know, I know, I know there's oil. Robyn: Oh, my God. I didn't want to be responsible for ruining an entire course. Woo-hoo! I found it. Marcel: Oh. All right, you guys, move your ass. We're seriously in the weeds. Can I get an ETA, please? Marcel, ETA? Marcel: We got somebody on the other side? It's kind of like a frantic scramble to catch up. No, no, no, no. Keep it there. Antoinette: ETA, somebody? I feel like I'm being pulled all over the place. Marcel, are we almost ready? Fish here, cook there. Go around to the other side, other side, other side. This is nuts. It was all hands on deck. Right behind ya. Jarrid: And we all worked together as a team. Marcel: Ready to go? Excuse me. For your next course, we have my interpretation of lomi lomi. Instead of using salmon, I'm using this fish called amadai, and so I've got tomato concasse, a little scallion puree, and then lastly we have a broth. And the cool thing about the amadai is actually, when I cook it like this, you can actually see the scales, they'll all start to rise up and get super crispy. Thank you. Marcel: Well, enjoy. - Steve: Boy, that is so tender. - Brandy: Is it? It's bringing a little flavor to the Hawaiian style. Wow, what a combination of flavors. Marcel: Okay, so we drop all the plates, then we go through with the meat. We drop all the meat on the rocks? Devon: Yes. Where's the other rocks? The other rocks, other rocks? Devon: Other rocks, oven, oven, oven. Marcel: Hotel pan, hotel pan. It's so hot. It's so hot. Oh, you got [bleep] gloves on. This is, potentially, a very dangerous dish. Can you imagine if one of these rocks drops on a guest? It could seriously burn them. Jarrid: Servers, you hear us how excruciating this is? Marcel: With this dish, there's so many things that can possibly go wrong. Marcel: Jarrid, go turn on your volcanoes. So I wonder how this is gonna work. Marcel: I feel like I actually might have made a big mistake with this course. I'm just, like, oh, my God. Marcel: I'm gonna drop the meat while you heat the volcano. Jarrid: Oh, [bleep] Marcel: Everyone is extremely nervous about this dish. These rocks are [bleep] hot. Please warn the guests, the rocks are hot. Robyn: I was so nervous that I could actually hear the dishes shake. Man: Careful. It's hot. The rock was really scary, having a really hot rock right in front of you. - Man: Do not touch the rock. - Okay. But thrilling at the same time. The hot stone was just a tremendous, tremendous presentation. I'm so relieved that the guests are okay and they were happy. But I am totally concerned about the volcano. Marcel: Jarrid, turn on your volcanoes. I'm dreading the moment that this volcano is supposed to erupt. For your next course, we have pineapple short ribs. You have your hot rocks right in front of you, which I'm gonna cook your first piece on. This dish is actually in twos. On top of the hot rocks, we have some lava sea salt. Then we also have two types of onions. There's a Maui onion puree and little crispy Maui onion rings served with a little bit of watercress. And we have the volcanoes, which are about to start flowing... any moment now. Antoinette: Everybody's feeling, okay, when is the moment gonna happen when this volcano decides to do it's thing? [no audible dialog] Jarrid: I hit the switch, the volcanoes lit up, but no pineapple sauce. God! - So it didn't erupt? - Jarrid: It didn't erupt. Jarrid: So what do we have? We have a couple of lights that look like volcanoes. Yay! Yay, I'm a frickin' genius. Jarrid: I'm just gonna run away now. Marcel: I'm glad I served an additional pineapple sauce but it still actually looked pretty cool. It had that appearance of lava, there was just no lava floating down it. But at least my short ribs on the hot rocks seemed to be a huge success. Mm. Oh, man. Steve: Never had meat cooked on a rock. The flavor was incredible and really special. Never had anything like it in my life. Marcel: Devon, where we at with that dessert? Marcel: We're down to our last course. How's it comin', Devon? Marcel: The fauxconut dessert. How many have you made so far? - One. - [bleep] Ugh! The problem is we have to make 15 of these frozen desserts, and it took us half an hour to make one. Jarrid: Using the balloon technique doesn't look good. Marcel: All right, here's another idea. Marcel: It was at that moment when I came up with the idea to initiate a plan B. We're gonna do a coconut cream instead of doing the balloon. Okay, we literally have 10 minutes to do this [bleep] dessert. Ten minutes to get these [bleep] desserts out. Jarrid: We're goin' down, baby, goin' down. Nitrogen, yes? Marcel: Now I'm gonna have to give everybody a crash course... Marcel: Coconut, coconut. on how to inject the coconut foam into the ladle and dip that into the liquid nitrogen so it freezes around the outside but it's still liquid and creamy in the center. Marcel: Make it really nice and frosty, yeah? Robyn: Okay. I want to take a minute and thank everybody for coming to celebrate Steve's 45 years in the business and 50 shaping. And there's one more surprise that I think will really make you feel like home. Steve: Oh, my God. Brandy: Steve's daughter, Lizzie. Steve: That is the one I haven't seen yet. Kaleo. Brandy: Steve has a large family in Hawaii, and they couldn't come over, but we flew in his youngest daughter with Steve's grandson who he's never seen. Oh, gosh. Hey. [laughing] Hey, you. Just to be able to hold him and seeing him for the first time just topped the whole thing off. Very emotional for me. This is Kaleo. All: Hi, Kaleo. Do we have any more ladies? We only have a few minutes to make the fauxconunt. Hopefully, it works because there's no time to do anything else. Devon: Okay. Well, then, let's all pray. Marcel: Fill it up with cream. Marcel: This dish is testing our team work. You're gonna give it a quick little baste, so outside frozen, inside cool. Devon: Keep 'em comin'. Feels like six different components. The lava cakes, coconut gels, and, of course, the fauxconut. It's lookin' good so far. - Marcel: How are you doin'? - Robyn: Good. Robyn: Marcel is reacting well under the pressure. I'm actually impressed by how calmly he's managing the team. Marcel: Great work, everybody. Marcel: We managed to get all the desserts out. Were we able to make any successful balloons earlier? Devon: One. Got this one ready to go. - Marcel: Hold on. - Devon: Just tell me what to do. Marcel: Just put that down. I'm using this. Marcel: Devon was able to actually execute one fauxconut by using the balloon technique. Hey, Devon, does this thing work? I'm gonna use the coconut cream, which is the same component that all the guests are eating, to fill this big, hollow balloon fauxconut. And this bad boy is gonna be for Steve, our guest of honor. Oh, my God. Marcel: A big coconut. You get the big coconut. All right, man. So here we have the fauxconut with a little bit of macadamia lava rock, and there's a little cacao soil, there's a coconut fluid gel, some fresh Thai coconuts, and a couple different textures. - Enjoy. - Thank you. Steve: Ooh, gosh. Look at that. Brandy: It's just like coconut stuffed inside there. The presentation of the dessert was really fun because it looked like we each had our own little personal coconut. but I break into it and it's got ice cream on the inside and it was incredible. Steve: Oh, my gosh. Antoinette: Besides the dormant volcano, Marcel achieved what I had hoped for and brought it to another level. Marcel: Given all the trials and tribulations that we faced to execute this amazing luau, it's a miracle that we even got it done. You guys. Thank you. - Wow. - Yeah. - How do you feel? - It was good. - I feel pretty good. - I would have liked a little more eruption on my volcano, but, whatever. Jarrid: Marcel's stepping up and actually acknowledging the work that we're doing, and he should after what happened last time. So it's a good start. We worked like a team, and that's the most important thing. - Know what I mean? - Yes. We killed it. Bring it in. Group hug. Thanks, guys. I'm glad the team came together and I feel like, I don't know, we were like one big happy family. Marcel: Robyn, welcome to the family. Devon: We all gotta do it-- - Marcel: Yeah. - Devon: Sometime. Devon: Welcome to the family, Robyn. To make it a real official initiation, I think you get the lei. Devon: Welcome to the family. Robyn: I'm comin for you. == sync, corrected by elderman == Male announcer: Previously on Eureka... When I thought about going to Titan, I always thought about doing it with you. Hey, I'm sorry. I don't know how I feel about a lot of things. And I am trying to figure it out. A house isn't a home unless you share it... With the person that you love. Living together, huh? Just think about it. Ground commander Henry Deacon here. We set our sights on Titan and many thought it impossible. But that is what we specialize in at Global Dynamics. Today is a day all of Eureka should be proud of. This is our moment in history. - Hey, you. - Hey. Big day, huh? Oh, I hadn't noticed. - Ah, you're so cute. - Yeah. I'm sorry I rushed out on you this morning. Listen... I had final software flight checks. Then I spilled coffee on my blouse. I had to run back to my place to change. Well, you know the way to avoid that is actually if you have your blouse and your stuff at my house. Yes, I know. I'm sorry, it's a big decision moving in together. I don't want us to leap before we look. Well, I've always been a leap blindly sort of guy. Oh, really? Like in the four years it took you to finally ask me out? So you'll just get back to me whenever then? - Yeah, see you at the launch. - Okay. All right, that's... Can you believe this morning we'll watch the sun rise on Earth, and tonight we'll watch Saturn set on Titan? Well, technically, Saturn never sets. Titan's tidally locked so the same hemisphere always faces Saturn. It is so hot that you know that. [Laughs] Wow! We're going go farther than man has ever gone before. Speaking of that, I've been thinking about us... Going farther. Really? A lot. I just really want our first time to be something special. Me too. We're kind of running out of time. Not if our first time was on Titan. Dr. Fargo... Are you suggesting we join the billion mile-high club? Mm-hmm. [Beeping] Final bio-pod demo. Ready? Safety first. Okay, everyone, this will be the last review of the bio-pod safety protocols. We anticipate that long distance faster-than-light travel exerts incredible stresses on the body. The bio-pods on Astraeus will be your cocoon for your journey to Titan. Zane, can I use you? If I had a nickel for every... Nah. Never mind. So, once your oxygen mask and monitors are attached, the chamber will fill with stasis gel designed by our own Dr. Parrish. The gel will maintain your core body temperature. And it will also buffer the high g forces we expect to occur during the acceleration and deceleration pulses. We wouldn't want anyone to turn into a pancake upon arrival. It's a shame your goo is going to Titan without you, Parrish. It's quite all right, Dr. Fargo. I whipped up a very special batch just for you. In the unlikely event of pod failure, the emergency life support seats that you pass when you came in will activate. Strap in, hold on tight. It will be a bumpy ride, but it will be your best chance at getting there alive. Thank you, Dr. Blake. Questions. Can I trade pods with someone else? Any other questions. No? Good. Okay, we will see you on board at T-minus two hours to lock you in. Let's go. I'm trying to keep cool but I'm really excited. Are you excited? Nah, I don't... I'm so excited! You excited? Yeah, I'm so excited, I have to pee. Huh. - I'm gonna go do my pre-flight checklist, okay. Oh, hey, Jo. - Hey. - Isn't this amazing? It is amazing. A billion-mile journey. You ready? Absolutely, yes...sort of. I'm still a smidge nervous about the whole billion-mile thing. Hey, you are the last person that should be nervous about leaping into the unknown. Look what you've done as director of G.D. Jo, we both know they handed me the job. I didn't earn it. Okay, well maybe other Fargo didn't, but you definitely proved that you were up to the job. Can you even remember the last time you pushed the wrong button? Actually, no. See? Look, whatever happens, I know you can handle it. Carpe Diem, right? Thanks, Jo. [Laughs] Come here. Carpe Diem! - Hey! - Hey! Ah, Larry said you were looking for me. What's up? Yeah, there is something that I need to ask you. I was um... Hoping that we could keep it between us. Of course. Come on. Thanks. So, we're almost ready to bring the F.T.L. reactor online. Let's initiate activation protocols. Yes, sir. So, how's it going commander? All systems go, captain. This is really it. Six months apart. You know what? This is going to be hard. Couldn't we just postpone it one more day? I mean, you're mission commander, you can pull some strings. You know I probably could, but our safest launch window is between 18:23 and 20:37. Now I mean we've done billions of calculations to factor in the orbit of Titan and Saturn, solar winds, - radiation pressure... - I get it. It's just that I'm going to miss you. Oh, I'm going to miss you too. Whoa! That's appropriate! Don't you guys have sciency stuff to do? You know what, Jack, you're just in time to see us fire up the FTL ion reactor. [Laughs] What's that? - Uh, the big-ass battery that will power the Astraeus launch. - Why don't you just say "big-ass battery?" Ready when you are, Dr. Deacon. Okay. Here we go. [Rumbling] Does that blue water do something, or does it just look cool? Ah, the cooling containment shields. Without the reactor would overheat and shut down. Ah. [Alarms] Very impressive. Senator... All systems are running smoothly and we are go for launch in T-minus seven hours and twelve minutes. Good to hear. We wouldn't want to disappoint our special guest. Our special guest? [Sirens] Eureka. We have the ball. Copy. The President of the United freakin' States? Are you kid... What, I would have brought a camera. - Your PDA has a camera in it. - No, it... What? Where? Try to be professional. - Where? - Um. [Sirens] [Camera clicks] [Explosion] [Screams] [Tires skidding] [Various shouting] Stay down! [Screaming] Eureka s04 e20 "One Giant Leap" Season Finale [various shouting] - Come on. - God... There you go. That's not Obama. That guy's okay though. I should have known. Secret service always sends an advance team. They're testing us. I...did... What happened? Doesn't even look like him. Carter, focus. Well, um, there was a giant beam of light. Like a laser. Like a laser and it just sliced through the limo. We have to assume this was an assassination attempt. Or we assume it's Eureka and laser things happen all the time. Well, it wasn't a laser. At least not exactly. It was a charged particle burst. A particle... From where? Well, satellite imagery should give us a point of origin. An energy beam this powerful would have left a trail. I'm on it. We need a satellite security scan ASAP. Okay, we'll tell senator Wen to cancel the president's visit. Until we know what happened, he is not safe here. Uh, do you want to delay launch? No... The launch bay is in a secure area a mile below ground. As of now there is no indication that this has anything to do with the mission. But I will keep Henry and Grace in the loop. - Let me know what you find. - Sure. Uh, life's never dull. Not even for a moment. [Various voices] [Radio calls] How we looking, jo? Oh, uh, yeah... It should be just up ahead. [Whirring noise] Something on your mind? No. Well, it would have been nice to meet the president. [Laughs] Would have been nice to know there's a camera in my PDA. I've been carrying that thing around for years. You know, there is something else, um... I know Allison and the kids may be moving in, and I think it's time I find my own place. Oh... Where you going to go? I'm working on that. All right. Well take as much time as you need, okay? Thanks. So the satellite imagery says that we're close. So does this imagery. Whoa. It looks like the death Ray took care of itself. Okay, so we just need to figure out what it does, so we can find out who built it. Or just... Read the label. Or there's that. Oh, my baby. What did you do to it? We didn't to anything. Your little death ray nearly killed Faux-bama. All right, first off... It is not a death ray, it is a life array. And second, what the hell are you talking about? Dr. Plotkin, it sliced a limo in half. No, it didn't. Look, it collects the energy that is naturally all around us. It doesn't expel it. Collects it how? Well, my rods, unlike a solar cell, store up the ambient energy from the full range of the the electro-magnetic spectrum. All right, so gamma rays, radio waves, thermo radiation, even cosmic waves. So once it's perfected, the electric grids, nuclear power stations, they're all going to be obsolete. If it just stores the energy, then how'd it shoot a particle bursty thing down main street? It didn't. That's not what they do. Okay, how about in combination with one of those... Uh, yeah... Ah, the bomb closet. Yeah, okay, okay. Okay, I used to work in unconventional weapons, okay, back in the day. All right, I keep those relics around just to remind me of what I used to do. What I used to do. - Before? - Yeah. But now, I'm totally about positive energy. And bombs... Bombs are super negative. My rods do good. Rods plural. Okay, you mean there are more of those things? Yes, the array consists of 15 rods spread around Eureka. Well... 14 now. Do you have a map of the array? Oh, you mean did I kill a tree so I could write it down for your convenience? No. Okay, will you email it to us? Computers are not biodegradable. And neither is that thing by the way. Ah, you know there's no need to be rough. You know I do have rights. Uh huh. I'll give you guys a minute. - Sheriff? - Yeah... So what were we talking about a minute ago? That I can show you where all the arrays are. Is this going to end any time soon? - No. - Ah! Oh, my God... Mom, this is so tight. [Laughs] Thought you might like to see this. - Oh, my God, this is a real bio-stasis pod? [Laughs] It's pretty cool, huh? Can I try it out, mom, please? Oh honey, I'm sorry... There's all sorts of sensors and nano-tech injections you have to do before you get in. It's a whole big thing. You're crazy, mom. I can't believe you didn't want want to go on this thing. And miss six months with a surly teenager? Are you kidding me? Um... Kevin... - I want to ask you something. - Yeah. How would you feel about all of us moving in with Jack? You mean like us living together? In his house? Well, I mean, yeah, it would be our house too. But... What do you think? Be honest. Would S.A.R.A.H. clean my room? I... I imagine so. Yes! Okay, cool, I'm in. I'm in. [Laughs] Okay, me dorsal fin friends. We'll have you spawning in no time. Huh. Hey. Good day, sheriff. Jo... Dr. Plotkin... Well, Taggart I see you're still experimenting on God's creatures. Would you please explain to Dr. Plotkin, that my research benefits all life on this planet. Not just the electricity consuming kind. And would you please tell him that... Stop! I like that plan. We're just here for his rod. Eyesore. Good riddance. You know what an eyesore is? That tank you call a truck. Ignore him, Taggart. Your truck is special. [Roaring noise] Not anymore. Me truck! She's gone! I know. That was amazing. Did you see that? - Did-did... yeah. Definitely not an assassination plot. It could be. Probably not. My mind cannot begin to process what happened here. Well, process this. Could your rods be responsible? Oh, do you really think that's possible? That's why I'm asking you. You owe me a new rig, mate. That beauty was one of a kind. That beast was a gas-guzzling monstrosity. She ran on methane. Oh, enough! Whatever's happening, it could be tied to the rods. So let's turn them off. It's not as if there's a big master off switch. They don't operate at some corporate synergistic programming, sheriff, they're individual entities. So we shut them off one at a time. Come on, it'll be like old times. We'll do it together. You hate jobs like this. Have you met you? Well maybe I am learning to appreciate the simple things in life. Right on, sister. Don't call me sister. Ow! Taggart, Plotkin, okay! You guys take the West Side of town, Jo and I will take the east. Right? Come on! Holy Christmas! Well, I guess I'm driving. Don't push it, mate. Get the rod! Eh, you get it. Waste of skin. Oh, uh, officer on deck! Well here we are. Hours before the single most historic spaceflight since we walked on the moon. We have all sacrificed a lot to be here. As have our families and our loved ones. Six months is a very long time. And those months will test us in ways we can't imagine. But with the support of our community and each other, we will get through this together. I am honored to be your captain. Well, that's it. I will see you all at 1,600 hours. [Applause] What do you think she meant when she said the mission will test us in ways we can't imagine? Well, we could get incinerated during the flight. Or we could get trapped outside the Titan habitat and be asphyxiated in the toxic atmosphere. Well, you'll probably be frozen solid first. Or... Maybe she just meant it metaphorically. Yeah, maybe. What was that for? Just a little taste of Titan. This is the last one, right? [Laughs] You hate this stuff. Four down, three to go. So where's Allison on the whole moving in thing? Ah, she's still thinking about it. Well, no offense Carter, but you haven't exactly got a lot of luck in that area. Thanks for the support. That's nice. But you know I think that you do have it in you. And I want you to be happy. Thanks. You know I'm going to miss you around the house. I'll miss you too. Um, so how are you with the whole Zane leaving? Oh [Laughs] - Oh, regrets. - Well, some. But I feel like there's something else for me. I just have to find it. There is. [Pinging sound] - Two more rods. - Yes. Let's go. Ah, Dr. Deacon. I can't tell you how sorry I am that you're not on this mission. Well, you know, everybody is on this mission. Just not everybody's going to Titan. FTL reactor, cell one. 100%, fluctuation nominal. Cell two... 81%, fluctuation... 81%. Look, see you've got a minor power drain. A drain? From what? I'm not sure, senator. I just discovered it. But there is enough power to launch? Yes, the fluctuation is less than a gigawatt. But we will have to hold the countdown clock to T-minus five hours and thirteen minutes. Mark. But you said there was enough power to launch. We're not going to proceed until we've repaired - the power drain. - Of course. The safety of the crew comes first. But this launch has to happen, Dr. Deacon. The future of Eureka depends on it. So figure it out. Figure it out? Start diagnostics. - Reactor team, you're with me. - Yes, sir. [Groans] [Laughs] Ooh, be sure to hand out the powdered broccoli. That was the last one. All the energy rods have been shut off. Eh, that's too bad. I was sort of looking forward to tromping through another sheep pasture. Dr. Plotkin stuck his rods in some odd places. [Laughs] What are you, 12? - What, are you 12? - You're 12. A taste of Titan in honor of the launch. Nothing but the most advanced culinary techniques. Sphere five tomato soup, cryo-desecrated grill cheese sandwiches... Just the way pop used to make em. Thanks, Vince. I think we're more hoping for lunch than a chemistry lesson. Cooking is chemistry, sheriff. Ooh, what about a burger with nitrogen bacon foam? Ooh, a burger sounds good. - Oh, come on, bacon's good. - Look. [Roaring sound] [Screams] All right, everybody out! Come on, let's get out, people! [Various shouting] Come on! Let's go Carter! [Loud roaring] Well... That sucks. It was like a spinning hole and then everything went red and the Cafe just collapsed and disappeared. You saw a naked singularity. No, that I would have noticed. That would be a black hole. Technically speaking, you can't see black holes. No light reflects off of it and the red whirls resulted it absorbing most of the color spectrum. Yeah, but sometimes if it's the right size, you can see a naked singularity around the... You're right, forget it. The point is black holes in Eureka, bad. See? That I get. But a collapsing black hole, that might explain the photon burst that sliced the limo. And the spaghettification of Taggart's truck. Real term. But black holes don't just pop up out of nowhere. Well no actually they pop up all the time. It's just they're either to small, or dissipate too quickly for anyone to notice them. Okay. So first my PDA has a camera and now black holes are everywhere. People need to know these things! But something is causing the black holes to stabilize long enough to do major damage. Well it can't be Plotkin's rods. I mean we turned them off before the Cafe was hit. Yeah but they're forming randomly now. There some other energy source feeding them. The power drain in the FTL ion reactor. That's the battery. Got that. Uh, we had a leak in the containment. Now the escaped ionic energy could charged the atmosphere around Eureka enough to allow Plotkin's array to stabilize the black holes. The fuse is now lit! Maybe you should think about fixing that leak. No, we did, but if the atmosphere is charged, it takes hours before it dissipates. Until then, more black holes that could spaghettify Eureka. Plotkin's rods still attract them, right? Maybe we could lead them out of town? Good! Someplace remote. We can place the rods around the lake, that way we can pin in the black holes long enough for them to dissipate harmlessly and on their own. And don't say theoretically. Theoretically. Woman on PA: Countdown holding at T-minus five hours, thirteen minutes, eleven seconds. Zane. - Hey. - Hey. Where you been all day? Oh, you know, dealing with the usual stuff. [Laughs] That bad, huh? Um... Yeah. Look, I, um... I have to go. But I just I wanted to make sure I caught you before the big launch. You sure you don't want to come along? I mean, we can probably share my bio-pod. Um... - It's very tempting. - Mm-hmm. But I have some other stuff that I need to do. I'll be thinking about you. I'm sure you say that to all your alternate timeline hookups. No. You were never a hookup. I gotta go. Yeah. Be safe up there. I will. Take care, JoJo. Wait! It's not going to create one of those photon bursts like the thing that sliced through Faux-bama's car. You can un-clench, man. My rods will absorb any gamma rays. Kind of what they do. Right. - Hit it. - All right. [Rumbling] - Holly! - Ooh. I need to say something before we launch. Oh, do you want to go ahead and do it now, just in case? I want to tell you I love you. Just in case. Oh, wow! That's really... Wow. Good wow or how-do-I-tell- this-joker-to-back-off well? How-do-I-get-so-lucky wow. Phew! Maybe our second time can be on actual Titan? Oh, yeah. Maybe our third. Both: [Giggling] This really makes you appreciate how much amazing stuff is out there in the universe. And we just never get to see. I'm going to go with... Makes you terrified. - Huh! - That's kind of interesting. Shouldn't those little black dots be blinking out of existence right about now? Theoretically. Yeah, they seem more interested in joining together as one. Yeah. Yeah one big one. You think... We should, uh... - Run? - Yeah. Sorry. Hold on. Okay. Nope. Nope. Nope. Right there. My team's cordoned off the area around the black hole, secure perimeter is two kilometers. For the moment, but it's still growing. Yeah, but the good news is my array should keep it focused over the lake. And the bad news is no boating on lake Archimedes? More like no more Eureka. If we wait for a black hole this size to dissipate on its own, it will release a catastrophic gamma ray burst. Yeah... And that's like annihilation at the molecular level, which is a total bummer. Can we make it dissipate? Like a smaller boom? The heart of a black hole is incredibly dense matter. To force one to dissipate we would have to simulate what happens in a hyper nova maybe with a gamma ray laser or an anti-matter bomb. - Anti-matter, we have that. Um, um, um, grandma. Had-had the... the penny trap and the floating bank. Penning trap, and we've got it here in secure containment. Yeah, so we grab that, we throw it in the hole, and then wshh! Day saved. In theory. The problem is the delivery system. Any conventional bomb casing will spaghettifi - and detonate too soon. - Hmm. Hmm. If only we knew some sort of unconventional bomb maker. Oh, no, no, man, no. I don't roll that way anymore. I don't do bombs. Anymore. I can't. You will. Ah, I feel so dirty. You'll live. All right now this is a high tensile torpedo shell. I developed it to withstand the pressures of deep sea deployment. Or in this case, spaghettification. All right, where's the anti matter? Heads up... Oh, good timing. - Bullet's ready. - All right. Okay, well how do we fire it. A projectile launch might rupture the containment shield. Yeah... That's why it's gonna have to be hand delivered. And I'm the delivery boy. So, how close do we have to get it? Gauging a minimum safe distance is impossible, we just need you get the bomb to the event horizon intact. So I'm winging it? Pretty much. Better you than me. You're good to go. All right then. Off to storm the black hole. Just don't get sucked in. I may need help with the move if I say yes. I love you. I love you too. Just feel the energy, sheriff. - Shut up! - Be careful. Okay. Get your own girlfriend. I have a girlfriend. Her name is science. [Roaring wind] I think this sucks! I'm here! [Groans] You should be feeling the tidal pull now. Yeah! I'm feeling it! Am I close enough? Deliver the missile... [Radio buzzing] Allison? Carter? We've lost him. [Groans] Close enough! Only a black hole! Yeah. Ah! him. Good luck, Rangers and let to Power protect you. It's Morphin Time. Mastodon! Pterodactyl! Triceraptops! Sabretooth Tiger! Tyrannosaurus! Power Rangers! You don't stand a chance! Now he's going to grow! We need Megazord Power! Now! Let's do it! ( all yelling ) - Log on. - In the groove and on the move! All systems go. We're looking good! Frankie, you're finished. Power up! Megazord Sequence has been initiated! Megazord Activated! Go, my monster. It's time for some more firepower. Ha! Ha! Ha! This dude's gonna be tougher than I thought. Tommy, come in. I read you, Zordan. Your fellow Power Rangers are in trouble. Join them immediately. Right. I'm out of here. Dragonzord! This guy's tearing us apart. How are we stop him? First let's get Megazord on his feet. - Ugh! - Ugh! Switch to emergency power before he get us again! ( laughing ) That is so beautiful. ( all screaming ) ( laughing ) The monster had done it! Yeah! ( laughing ) - Ugh! - Ugh! Dragonzord Power! ( playing music ) I can't breathe! It's time to regroup. Let's do it! We need Megadragonzord Power! All right! Let's finish it! Throw out the powerstaff! # Power Rangers # # Go, go, Power Rangers # Yeah! Got him! # Go, go, Power Rangers # # You Mighty Morphin Power Rangers # This guy's got one bad case of indigestion. Oh, I have such a headache. I just can't stand it. Oh... Well, Rita finally got what was coming to her. And we sure sent that Frankenstein monster back to the lab. We got back in time for the costume contest. Tommy, where's your costume? I've got it right here. I'll change. By the way, whatever happened to Alpha? He's got his hands full, so to speak. You bet I do. Cool, Alpha. You are a hit. They like me. What's to like, tin can? Who are you, anyway? ( growling ) Oh gosh! Frankenstein gave me some ideas for my costume. Well? What do you think? Quite believable, Tommy. You look great in grey. ERNIE: Okay, everybody. Time to announce the winner of the costume contest. And the blue ribbon goes to whoever you are. You're kidding, right? Who's the mystery winner? Yeah, I'd like to find out myself. Skull, give me a can opener. Yo. This is one mystery that has to remain unsolved. Sorry, ladies. Captioned by Grant Brown Ahhh! After 10,000 years, I'm free! Its time to conquer earth! Alpha, Rita's escaped! Recruit a team of teenagers with attitude! # Go, go, Power Rangers # # Go, go, Power Rangers # # Go, go, Power Rangers # # Mighty Morphin Power Rangers # # Power Rangers # # Power Rangers # # Go, go, Power Rangers # # You Mighty Morphin Power Rangers # ( Squatt laughing ) Now let's see. That power source for Billy's new invention has got to be around here somewhere. Hmm. Aha! Just what I was looking for. I'll just attach this to that and that to this, and bingo! ( laughing ) When Billy tests his new gizmo his head will be scrambled like an omelette. ( laughing ) Those other Power Brats will be so busy trying to help him, they won't pay attention to what Rita's doing! ( maniacal laughing ) GOLDAR: Now you can send down a monster. Yeah, you're right. And that monster will be the Genie. An excellent choice - Your Majesty, as usual. - Goldar, take a look. This is the chance we've been waiting for. We can finally get rid of the Power Rangers? Attack! KIMBERLY: Like, what is this new project? I've been working on this new system to facilitate direct thought transfer. You have a way for me to read your mind? Affirmative. I'm still experimenting but I'm sure it will work. ( dog barking ) Did you hear that? Yeah. Sounded like a dog. No, numbskull. That geek, Billy, invented a machine that can read people's minds. People's minds? If you had a mind to read. Imagine the possibilities. The apparatus is somewhat imposing. Morphinomenal. Watch the 'do, okay? Ah, don't worry. I'm certain that my parameters are within the specified range. ( faint barking ) Okay, now I just have to flip down this micro-generator switch then we're all set. ( faint barking ) Hey, Bulky. Shh! Are you ready? Uh-huh. BILLY: Let me make one more adjustment. Bulk! What do you want? - Oh... - ( barking ) Nice doggy. Are... you feeling nominal? Like, I think so. Billy? Kimberly? Look, what happened? The, uh, generator experienced diathermic overload. What? We've undergone spatial personality displacement. Will you please speak english? My brain's in your body and yours is in mine. What? ( screaming ) GOLDAR: Now that we have the magic lamp from canine four of the wolfhead's galaxy those Power Rangers will be taken care of finally. - Have you got it? - Uh-huh. Well, what are you waiting? Go on. Rub the lamp. Rub it? - Of course. - Whoo! ( giggling ) Wow! Whoa! Are you a Genie? At your service. Well, what do you know? It worked! Genie, you are going to be sent down to Earth and there you will attack the Power Rangers and destroy them. Is that understood? Your wish is my command. ( rattling ) ( chuckles ) I saw how he did it. It's a piece of cake. Come on. Get in there. Well, what do you want me to do? When I flip the switch, think of something and I'm going to try and read your mind. Hey, Bulk-- can I think of Kimberly? Don't tell me, you dimwit. I'll try and read your mind. Think. Think. ( gurgling noises ) ( laughing ) ( screaming ) GIRL: Talk about a major gross-out. Keisha, Stephanie, look. ( girls laughing ) Well, I think makeup's overrated anyway. BOY: Show me how to do file sorting. Push shift F4 and then you, uh... Push this grungy button over in the corner. But that's the delete key. Uh, not that corner, silly. KIMBERLY: The project of the day is the Cheese Souffle. ( mixer whirring ) ( girls screaming ) Are you feeling all right? Maybe we should do this another day. No. I think we can get this. Uh, here it is. Why did you do that? Like, what's the big deal? ( beeping ) The Cheese Souffle. Ooh! ( beeping louder ) ( nervous laughing ) Take cover! ( all screaming ) CLASS: Aw... Kimberly... SQUATT: I got only one question. Can he beat the Power Rangers? I shall destroy them. Hey, I like this guy! We'll send you down to Earth inside the lamp so Zordon can't detect your arrival. Once he does, it will be too late. Right. Well, get back in the lamp now. ( Squatt giggling ) Like, people think I've gone totally mancky. Look at the way I've been looking-- my hair, my makeup. Yuck! Yeah. Well, I trusted you with an elementary tutorial and you turned my transmission decoders into a synaptic nightmare! What's wrong? I've never seen you guys arguing before. Billy's invention switched our brains. If you're Kimberly, then this is... Somebody who can't put on makeup. My synaptic interlock generators malfunctioned and I'm unable to reverse the personality displacement until I can rebuild it. Kimberly, are you in there? Afraid so. SKULL: Scarfing time. BULK: Yeah, scarfing time. You're breathing on my food. We got to do something. We've got to find that Billy geek. Oh. Right after I've eaten my spaghetti and meatballs. Yeah. Spaghetti and meatballs! GOLDAR: The Putties are ready, Your Highness! Good. Those insolent little brats are going to get exactly what they deserve. Take the monster down to Earth hidden in the lamp and not even Zordon will know he's there. Now send those two down to Earth, Goldar! - Yes, my Queen. - Yikes! Go ahead. Okaydokey. Here goes. Careful. You'll drop it. Oops! Can't you do anything right? ( yelling ) What are we going to do now? There is a dangerous disturbance in the Morphing Grid, Alpha. Send the Rangers to recover a lamp from Angel Grove Park. Right, Zordon. I'll get right on it. ZACK: Look, over there. That's it. I got it. Look, everybody. I got the lamp. What do you suppose it is? We got to get this thing to Zordon. Zordon, you said this was an emergency but it's just an antique oil lamp. What's so dangerous about it? The Genie who was once inside it. Rita was sent him to destroy the Power Rangers. ( siren blaring ) It's the Putty Patrol! Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi! ZORDON: Let the Power protect you. I'll take care of the lamp. Mastodon! Pterodactyl! Triceraptops! Sabre-toothed Tiger! Tyrannosaurus! - You okay? - Jason! ZORDON: Goldar and the Putties are a diversion. Send the Rangers to the Genie's location. Right, Zordon. I'm teleporting the Power Rangers now. - Aw, man. - What is this? I can't move. Zordon, the Power Rangers are in trouble. We must get them out of danger. Teleport them here immediately. I just hope we're not too late. That should do it. As you have seen, Rangers the Genie is powerful. You're right. Like major muscle. Nevertheless, the power to defeat him resides inside each of you. We couldn't get near him. We never even touched him. How will we beat this guy? By not working our maximum energy linkage. Correct. Believe in yourselves. Combine your powers, and the Genie cannot defeat you. All right, Power Rangers. Let's do it. Ready to move and in the groove. For sure. That Genie's done for, okay? We'll show him that his magic won't work on us. Affirmative. That Genie is finished. In your face, Power Rangers! Rita! We're going to have a lot of fun. ( Rita laughing ) Take a good look at what you're facing now. Whoa! RITA: Now, get them! Your wish is my command. Go, monster, and destroy the Power Rangers! Remember, together we can beat it so let's do it. ( roaring ) Dinozord power, now! Let's go! All right! Log on! Zach here. I'm kickin' it. Kimberly. Like, really... Trini. Ready to rock. Billy. On line. Power Rangers, power up. Two, one... power up. Let's show him some Megazord Power. Megazord Power Mode now! Megazord sequence has been initiated. Megazord activated. The Power Rangers are in trouble! Repeat-- Power Rangers in trouble. Danger! Danger! ZORDON: Alpha, calm down. Trace the source of the Genie's power. Perhaps that will unlock the secret to defeating him. Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi! I can't believe it. What have you found? The source of the Genie's power. It's... it's the lamp. You must dispose of it quickly. Right. We'll zap it in the teleporter. Not so fast. It must be done carefully. Too much power at one time will destroy the Morphin Grid and everything in it, including the Power Rangers. Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi! This isn't going to be easy. Keep it together. We got to beat him. He got our servo power circuits. Billy, you've got to rewire those servos to bypass the damage and tap into the Power Morphin system. you got to get us more power - before we get totalled. - I'll try! Kimberly, Trini-- he'll need help. Use your big drill. We've got to hurry, Zordon. The Power Rangers are in trouble. Patience, Alpha. You must increase the power slowly. The slightest error and we will all be vaporized. Saving our planet is not as easy as it used to be. ( laughing ) Oh, no! He's got us! Yes! Zordon, we've got to destroy it right now. Just a few more seconds, Alpha. But the Power Rangers don't have a few more seconds. Oh, I can't look. Now, Alpha. Full power. Look! Something's happening! ( groaning ) I've got one of those headaches again! Good-bye. ALPHA: When we destroyed the lamp, the Genie disappeared. All set. We got to go. Billy and Kimberly are about to make the switch. Ay-yi-yi! Tell them to be careful. Are you sure this will work? Uh, in science, nothing is certain. Will you pull the swtich? Well? What happened? Are you guys back to normal? I appear to have regained control ever my snapped neurons. Yeah, and I'm me too. Please, guys. Yeah. Please, guys. We want to go back to normal. Yeah. Normal. Have you guys been playing with my machine? Should I? Maybe we should teach them a lesson-- Not to mess with other people's property. I think they learned a lesson. All right. Step on up. Are we back to normal? Yeah. Normal? ( Bulk and Skull laughing ) Do you suppose I can borrow your brain for my maths test on Monday? Some people will never learn. Captioned by Grant Brown Theorizing that one could time travel within his own lifetime, Dr. Sam Beckett stepped into the Quantum Leap accelerator... and vanished. He awoke to find himself trapped in the past, facing mirror images that were not his own... and driven by an unknown force to change history for the better. His only guide on this journey is Al, an observer from his own time, who appears in the form of a hologram that only Sam can see and hear. And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself leaping from life to life, striving to put right what once went wrong... and hoping each time that his next leap... will be the leap home. Oh, boy! Who are you? Who are you? Alia. Where did you come from? The future. Where? I mean, when? Not now. Are-Are you talking to a hologram? Why haven't I leaped? Why am I still here? Lothos has decided you've got one more thing to do before you go. Surprise! - Why are you doing this? - Because she's evil. You have the power, Alia. You can choose not to kill me. No. Arnold, what are you doing? Get off! Are you insane? I can't see.! You're gonna get us killed! Slow down.! Hey.! Oh, my God. Just what the hell kind of stunt was that? - I don't know. - He must've landed on his head. Lucky it's empty. You guys were, uh, dragging', huh? Uh, dragging'? Duh! - We were chicken racing. - Yeah, till you hitched a ride. - Don't you get it? - Get what? He's the Midnight Marauder. - Right? - Uh, yeah, right. Listen, uh, I gotta- I gotta get goin', guys. No, you're not goin' anywhere, Arnold. How'd you know who I was? Everyone knows who you are. You're the weenie who just screwed up a Chi Kappa initiation. I think he thought I was in danger. You were. Look, we have been hazing pledges since before you were born, spaz, and we haven't lost one yet. Well, there's always a first time. Yeah, well, Arnold, here's a first for you. Enough of that, all of ya. Let's break it up. Shame on all of ya, huh? Now, who's gonna tell me what's been goin' on? Who might you be? A refugee from Joe McCarthy? They were having a fraternity initiation thing. Um, it's called a "hazing. " They were havin' a chicken- Picnic. A fried chicken box social, right, everyone? Well, you can thank God that I didn't see you racing' those crates, huh? Or you'd all be bunkin' in the jail tonight. But, as it is, I've gotta get your names for your dean of discipline. Let's start with you, Superman. Arnold. Arnold what? Arnold the- the Midnight Marauder. - Everybody knows me, I guess. - It's Arnold Watkins. W - A-T-K-I-N-S. College is wasted on the young. I mean, think of it. A four-year license to learn and have fun without the pressures of work and family. But whoever this guy Arnold was, he was lucky his license hadn't been revoked. It's you. Al. - Of course it's me. - No, I'm talkin' about the cape. It's you. Al, where have you been? What took you so long to get here? Well, I would've been here sooner, but I had to calm down your counterpart in the waiting room. This guy's really something. I bet. The Midnight Marauder, defender of the faith, protector of the innocent. - He's a wacko. - Look, Al, that's all great. But would you get outta here so I can get some sleep? I don't think you're gonna have time. What? In the original history, both Arnold and Jerry died when Arnold tried to stop the chicken race. But you saved 'em both, so hold onto your hat... or your cape or that thing, whatever it is. Al, if that's- if that's the whole problem, then why didn't I leap as soon as the race ended? - That's a good question. - Or why didn't I leap as soon as the cop got everything under control? You're full of good questions today. Al, please. Huh? I'm beat, okay? My hair hurts. So either have Ziggy figure out what I'm doin' here, or get outta here so I can get some sleep. I'm goin', okay? So this is your roommate, Jack Swenson. He's pledging this fraternity that you just annoyed. So where you been? Oh, I, uh-Al. I was at the library. Library closed an hour ago. Yeah. I finished studying, and then I went, uh - Jogging. Jogging. What's that? Jogging. You know. Running. Anyway, I, uh- It was dark, and there was a hole, and I kind of tripped and fell a little bit. He's clumsy. Right, right. And, uh, what would this be, huh? That's his blankie. You know, Arnold, Chi Kappa Delta was out at Road's End tonight. They were initiating a couple of new pledges, and, uh, word has it that, uh, you broke it up, Mr. Midnight. All right. Okay. I was there. No kidding? You know, Mike Hammond called me on the phone... about 10 minutes ago, and you know what he said? He said that they weren't sure that they wanted to pledge anyone with such a monumental jerk as a roommate. Why would you wanna pledge a fraternity that's full of idiots in the first place? - Full of what? - You said the wrong thing, Sam. His dad was a Chi Kappa Delta idiot, and his granddad, and his great-granddad was a founding idiot. Arnold, look. At first, it was funny, all right? I mean, it was, you prancing around in your little cape and hat and playing Errol Flynn. You were a joke. We all laughed. But it's not funny anymore. And if you don't stop pulling these loony stunts, you're gonna get yourself hurt. Or worse. Well, I guess you told him a thing or two, huh? I blew it, Al. No, no, actually, you didn't. I didn't? No. Jack has been bullying Arnold all semester, copying his assignments, makin' him do his laundry. And Jack's mother won't doJack's laundry. What are you tellin' me? I'm here to teach Jackie how to fluff and fold? Well, we don't know yet. But, uh, don't lift your leg on the family tree again, please. Thank you. You're welcome. What am I worried about anyway? I mean, after all, I am the- That's the Midnight Marauder? You're a scholarship student, and you're taking a double load of credits. Oh, you must be smart. Favorite course? Eh- Astronomy. How'd you know that? Because the Midnight Marauder knows all, sees all, tells nothing. Oh, no. Oftentimes, he-What? Well, your mind is merging with the Midnight Avenger. No, it's not. Yes, it is. It is not. I'm fine. And it's Marauder. See? See what? Sam, this is a guy that loves to dress up in tights and run around in the dark... pullin'crazy stunts like Captain Goody Two-shoes. Yeah, well, after today's stunt, he's lucky to still be alive. Yeah, he's amazing. He's like a walkin' miracle. Why, only last week in the rain, this guy decided to run in front of a speeding car- And save a fetching coed from certain death. Quit it! Undaunted, he- Sam, quit that! The driver swore that he hit him. But then when he ran back, there's Arnold comforting the girl and yelling at him for driving too fast. He didn't have a scratch on him. Well, let's just hope that his luck holds, Al, 'cause right now, I've got a whole fraternity of hot-rodders gunnin' for him. Hey, Arnold? Arnold Watkins. L - I just wanted to thank you again. Forget it. No, I can't. I did a lot of thinking last night, and I don't even know why I wanted to pledge Chi Kappa. I withdrew my application. Smart move. I also made sure you got the credit you deserved. Look, Jerry, Arn- I don't want credit. That's why I wear the mask. I did what anybody else would do. Jumping on the hood of a car at the start of a race? You did what nobody had the guts to do, and I'm alive to prove it. I'm really grateful. - Hey, Froot Loop, where are your tights? - Yeah. - Excuse us. We're late for class. - Aw! Read it and weep, spaz. "Midnight Marauder saves life of undergrad. " Of course, I don't get a byline since I'm only first-year. Our whole fraternity's on probation because of you, Arnold. I'm not happy. - Well, you earned it. - Yeah? Well, you earned something else too, pal. Hey, save it. Mike, save it.! Let go of me.! Cool it. We can't. Dean Sakmar finds out you popped this toad, and Chi Kappa Delta'll be off campus. I never met a real superhero before. Hi. I'm Dawn Taylor. Hi, I'm Arnold Watkins. Just how fast was that speeding car going? Oh, it wasn't really going fast. I mean, when I got on it- You okay? She's fine. She's fine. Her only problem is, she's smelling your dirty socks, Arnold. Right, baby? Yeah, right. What were you saying, Arnold? Never mind. It was nothing. - It was nice to meet you. - Yeah, it was nice meeting you too. - Here you go. - Thanks. He's so modest, it's cute. Cute? He's a twerp. Look at his clothes. Hey, you got wheels, Arnold? Yeah. Yeah, sure he does. - Studebaker, right? - Studebaker. Look, I hate to break things up, but, uh, we gotta get to class. Come on. You get back to class, Arnold, but put this in your twisted little head. I am holding you personally responsible for getting us in trouble with the dean. Yeah, well, twist on this, pal. You wanna know who's responsible, take a look in the mirror. I'm gonna kill him. I swear to God, I'm gonna kill that guy! Cool it, Mike. Anything happens to little Arnold, and we'll get our butts kicked outta here faster than you can say "expelled. " We're just supposed to let this happen? The dean, remember? Guess why we're here, darling. Lothos says we're dealing with some Woody Allen type. Perfect job for a homecoming queen. - There's nothing else we can do. - Frat boys. My favorite college subject. Yes, there is. What? What do you wanna do, hire a hit man? How do you think the Midnight Marauder would feel if he suddenly became very close friends with the homecoming queen? - Go on. - And then the homecoming queen tells the nerd it's all a big joke. - Where? - Someplace public, like a homecoming rally, so the whole college can see. And if he doesn't jump out of a window, he'll at least drop out. - I opt for the window. - This is a new you. I love the way you think. Al hadn't gotten back to me, but it was pretty clear why I hadn't leaped yet. I had a suspicion that a slap on the wrist from the dean wasn't gonna be enough... to keep Mike Hammond and his frat brothers from their games. I knew there had to be a way to get through to them, and I think maybe I just found it. Uh, this seat's not taken. - Really? - Yeah. Thanks. I'm sorry Mike was such a jerk today. Oh, it's not your fault. Most of the time he's really sweet. He only acts macho when it comes to his fraternity. - "Macho"? - Yeah, I learned it last summer in Spain. It means "manly, masculine. " Macho. Yeah, well, he sure likes actin' macho when he's out chicken racing with his buddies, doesn't he? - Yeah, you're not kidding. - Have you ever tried to talk him out of it? He doesn't listen to me. I'm just his girl. Oh, yeah, right. It's the '50s. I mean, I've got this feeling that-that someday, men are gonna be much more receptive to the way women think. Their ideas. You know, someday. That's nice. I'm glad somebody thinks that. Mike is so mean to you. Why do you care about him? The Midnight Marauder cares about everybody. You mean Arnold Watkins really cares about people? Right. Everybody needs to be cared for. - You remind me of someone. - Clark Kent? Don't sell yourself short. I can't place who, but I think it's wonderful that you help people. - Thanks. - I wish somebody would rescue me from my biology midterm. But it's not exactly a job for the Midnight Marauder. Oh, now, don't say that. I'm, uh - I'm pretty good at science. - Really? - Yeah. I tell you what. I have a little pull with Mike. If you help me with my biology midterm, I'll talk to him and see if I can't convince... him and the Chi Kappas to find some safer form of initiation. - You got yourself a deal. - 7:00, my dorm, tonight? - It's a date. - Okay. Okay. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Shh.! It's okay. I'll see you tonight at 7:00. - I'm talking about Michael of the Chi Kappas. - Don't worry about him. He's taken care of. I believe you. You have the light of truth in your eyes. My ex-wives would never say that. It makes me furious. Hammond is only one of a million villains who victimize the weak and the innocent. Here we go- the Midnight Marauder. So you understand my mission? Arnold, you're a college student. Your mission is to get good grades, swallow a couple of goldfish, and figure out how much you can drink without blowing chunks. What? Without barfing. That may be true for the others, but not for the Midnight Marauder. What makes you so special? Well, don't you look special. Arnold, that's a clip-on. Well, it's the only one I had. Well, I'll let you borrow one of mine. Uh, here. Thanks. This'll do. Yeah. So, where you goin'? Uh, study. You're gonna wear a tie to go study? Well, I have a date. Oh, a date. A study date. Oh, all right. So, who's the, uh - who's the lucky girl? Oh, it-it is a girl, right? Yeah, it's a girl, all right. Let me guess. Let me guess. It was that six-foot-tall beanpole with the, uh, Brillo-pad hair, right? You could guess all night, you'd never come up with this one. Oh. Thanks. Yeah. Well, I gotta go. Where are you goin'? Tonight's your initiation, isn't it? Bingo. That's what I like about you, Arnold - always on top of things. Chi Kappa Delta. Are you gonna race? I don't know. They never tell the pledges. But, uh, yeah. So, how do I look, huh? Like a dead man. Jack, don't do this. You say that like I have a choice. You do have a choice. Yeah, right. I can tell my dad and my granddad that I couldn't join Chi Kappa because I wimped out of the initiation process. No, I-I think I'd rather go chicken racing. I'll see ya, Arnold. Uh, hey, you look- Don't start, all right? Please, don't start. Sort of, but not very much. Listen, I want you to get to Ziggy, okay, and find out what she thinks the odds are that I'm here to stop the chicken races. Uh, 62.4. Oh, Al. It's gotta be better than that. Well, don't be so sure. Why not? It's Arnold, Sam. What happened to Arnold? He's had an incredible string of luck. But according to Ziggy, it's inevitable that he's gonna get killed or get maimed... if he keeps up with this Midnight Marauder junk. Well, what am I supposed to do? He's not here with me. He's with you. Well, here's what you do. You keep wearing that silly tie- Al- but you sit on the stupid red cape. I can't. What do you mean, you can't? Of course you can. Yes, you can. All right, all right. Let's just assume that you're right, okay? Okay. Then you and Beeks have to do a profile on Arnold right away, okay, to find out what makes him tick. Otherwise, I'm gonna leap outta here, he'll leap back in, and he'll start marauding all over again. Okay. I agree with you. You agree? Yeah, I agree. Oh. Oh, well, good. Of course it's good. Now what are you doing? I've got work to do. What are you doing with that stupid hat on? My mission. Your mission, "schmission. " Remember? What about the odds? The Midnight Marauder scoffs at the odds. Sam, don't you wanna use the door? Ha! Where the hell is he? He'll be here. Nerds are nothing if not punctual. Would you relax? I guarantee within five minutes, I'll have Arnold's slide rule fully extended. That's my girl. Oh, darling, you won't believe this. Your dream date is back at Road's End messing things up again. We're lucky tonight, brothers. Our pledge is a third-generation Chi Kappa Delta. He will be racing against brother Frank Pabst. Now, Frank's our champion, so you don't have to beat him. You just have to- You don't even have to race him. - Oh, I hate this. - Arnold! Risking one's life for a foolish reason is a crime against Mother Nature. Sam, you're completely out of control.! - Him, foolish? - Boy, is he right! - What are you saying? - I'm saying you're insane, Watkins, for even dreaming about coming out here and challenging us. I'm saying that you don't have to be here! Jack lives through this! - Oh, boy. - I smell blood here. Are you tellin'me thatJack is not in danger? - No, the only one in danger here is you, bozo. - Why didn't you warn me? I did! You were too busy dressing up as Little Red Riding Hood! You gotta figure me a way outta this fast, Al. Did I hear that right? Lothos? Oh, it's him. It can't be! What are we gonna do? "We"? I'm not even here! Al.! If I were you, I'd head for the bushes, wherever the bushes are. - Get him! - Go for the bushes, Sam! Go, if you can find any. It's so dark. Your little Arnold the dweezil is none other than Dr. Samuel Beckett. There's no worse feeling than being the object of a hunt, especially when the people chasing you are a bunch ofjocks with oatmeal for brains. But whatever Arnold and the Midnight Marauder had started, I couldn't seem to stop. - Is the coast clear? - Sam, would you come out from there, please? Where are they? I don't know. They probably figured that you were on the way back to the dorm. You're safe for the moment. Yeah, except I can't go to my own room. Well, I told you to stay there, but, no- No, what you told me didn't make any sense. Besides, I-I had to do something. No, you didn't. Arnold says that you got a bio midterm in the morning. You could have been studying, that's what. What time is it? 12:04. Oh! I had a study date. I missed it. Oh, Dawn. No, she'll still be there. She'll probably be happy to put up a homeless marauder for a night. You lucky dog. Al. Al. Al, the women's dorm is closed to men at all times. How did I know that? I told you. Huh? Mind-merging. You've absorbed a little bit of Arnold's mind. Speaking of Arnold, how's he doin' anyway? Well, we've been talking. But seeing how you're both acting, I better put Dr. Beeks on overtime. You know, Lothos is not too pleased with your prior performance concerning Dr. Beckett. Well, then why the hell did he send me here? - Seems to be as much of a surprise to Lothos as it is to us. - He's supposed to know everything. He does. Dr. Beckett's appearances follow the random event theory. It's just a fantastic stroke of luck. - Or maybe a little test to see if you've improved. - Just tell me my mission. Oh, don't tell me. - After all you've been through, you still- - Just tell me. I'm supposed to kill him, right? I'm supposed to blow his brains out? Afraid not, darling. Seems you weren't too successful with the gun last time. Perhaps a grenade or a flamethrower. - Zoey, just tell me! - Lothos hasn't decided. But whatever happens, Beckett must not know that you're here. So you may not touch him. Pity. I need to talk to you again, kid. Am I free to return now? No, not yet. Uh, I've had Dr. Beeks do a little computer research on you. Is that Dr. Beeks? No. Dr. Beeks is a person. She's a psychologist. She works here. So that's a computer? A terminal, yeah. It's amazing. The computer at the college takes up rooms and rooms. We've checked into your past, Arnold. The Midnight Marauder has no past. Well, Dr. Beeks disagrees. She says that we should talk about your parents. They died when I was seven. I know. I also know how they died. I was too young to remember. I think you remember. No, I don't. Oh. Well, maybe you're trying hard not to remember. But... everything that you've done ever since is because of this. Uh, the Masked Marauder stuff- Someone has to defend the innocent. Your parents were innocent, weren't they, Arnold? Do you remember a place called Latrobe, Pennsylvania, 1944? And a little diner named Rinker's Diner on Main Street? And a man named... Leon Kanowski? - Hey, baby. Right here. - Let go of me. What's wrong with you? - Nothing. - Where'd you disappear to last night? I tried to call you. I had a study date. Or did you forget? No, I didn't forget. But that was before your date tried to break up our initiation. I know. I was there. It was hilarious watching you all plowing through the bushes looking for him... with Arnold safely curled up in my backseat. Get your hands off me. This is me, baby. Mike. Your guy. My ex-guy. Don't tell me you're hot for that wimp. Oh, you'd be amazed, Mike. A man's performance on the basketball court has nothing to do with his performance in bed. Congratulations, stud. What did I do now? - I don't know, Arnold. Just what did you do? - Nothing. - Right. - Don't be so modest, Arnie. "Arnie"? "Arnie"? - I'm not ashamed of what we did. - Oh, that does it. I want you, dweebo, today at the quarry. Just wait a minute- And bring your wheels! If you wanna commit suicide, that's your problem. That's not what you said last night. What? You said Mike and his friends were just playing a bunch of crazy kids' games- that they had no idea what real danger was like. I'll show you danger. The quarry, an hour. Dawn, what's going on? Oh, my God. Alia? I don't have a choice, Sam. Alia? You don't understand. They tortured me. Let me go, Sam. It really is you. Let me go. I saw you die. It was worse than death. Please, Sam, let me go. Not until you tell me why you're here. I can't. Please don't make me go through that kind of pain again. Please. It's Arnold, isn't it? Isn't it? You saved him, didn't you? And now you're here to change that. He has to die. Where's what's-her-face? Uh, Chloe or - Zoey. She here? No, but she could be here any second. And if she sees me talking to you, she could tell Lothos, and then - I'm not gonna let you go away again. You don't have a choice. Yes, I do. Yes, I do, and so do you. You said that last time, and look where I am now. Alia, listen to me. Maybe we can leap out of here together. What? Maybe if we're close, if we're holding onto each other when I leap, then just maybe because we're the same, maybe we can leap together, and you can leave Lothos behind forever. No. Yes. Why not? No, they'll know. Zoey will know. Lothos will know. We'll just be careful. Look, I can't give you all the details, but Al is working with Arnold right now. And when he's done, I should leap. Should? Yes. What was your plan? I mean, how were you gonna kill me - Arnold? I don't even know. Zoey doesn't trust me. All I know is that I'm supposed to get you to drag race Mike at the cliffs. All right. Okay. Then we'll just play along. I mean, if I have to drag race, I'll drag race. Or I'll talk him out of it, whatever, until Al shows up. Well, how long will that be? I don't know. But soon. Alia, you have to trust me. It'll work. I'll leap, and you'll go with me. Sam? Yeah? What if I leap first? Delicious. Sam, how's it goin'? Sam, you're not dressing' up like that Midnight Avenger again, are you? Marauder, Al. And, no, I'm not. See? I'm not wearin' a cape. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. So what are you gonna be, a Hell's Angel or somethin'? Look, what's goin' on, Al? Well, I'm not sure. I just had a session with Arnold, and I think I'm startin' to get through to that kid. But I tell you what, he's had it very tough. - Sam? - Hmm? Why are you dressing up like Marlon Brando? - Aren't you supposed to be back in the waiting room? - A little touchy, aren't you? No, I'm not touchy. I'm just- I'm just a little nervous, that's all. You know, I mean, I gotta go out and do those chicken races today. Sam. What? Are you hiding something? No, I'm not. Sam. I'm not hiding anything. I know you too well. Now, what's goin' on? You trust me, don't you? Almost. Look, Al, all I'm doin' is I'm just biding' my time, okay, until you and Beeks get Arnold squared away. That's it. So, you know, as soon as you do that, then I'll be able to leap out of here, right? Uh, 79.5% chance you'll leap, yeah. - Get back there and get workin' on Arnold so I can leap outta here. - Sam- - I gotta go, Al. - Sam- - I gotta go. Sam- You think he'll show? I'm a student of human nature, Frank. He'll definitely show. Aren't you worried about the dean? Do I look worried? No. - Where's your Studebaker? - This car's just fine. - Tell me that you've ever been in a race, Arnold. - More than one. And what about you? You're just here to make sure everything's fair? In love and war, right? The guy's a bum. Sam, this is insane. You'll die, I'll leap, and- It'll work. It'll never work. Zoey? Uh-huh. She's here. I've been watching you all day. You have? Mm-hmm. You get a B-plus for Mr. Fraternity over there. Only a B-plus? Well, let's see. What do we do? I'll take care of it. Don't sweat it. He gets caught cheating on a final, he gets expelled from college, and even his own daddy won't employ him. Oh, isn't that special. Makes you wonder what really happened. But now, for the real target- Dr. Beckett. His name was Leon Kanowski. That's the right name, isn't it, Arnold? I don't recognize it. He was a cop. He had nine kids. And he got fired from his job, and he couldn't handle the strain. Why are you asking me all these questions? I'm sorry, kid. You said I'd be returned to my own time. You said I wouldn't be harmed. I'm not gonna harm you. Then why are you asking about my parents? Because I want you to be safe when you go back. You gotta stop taking these crazy chances, tryin' to get yourself killed. I protect the innocent. Arnold, you couldn't protect your parents... when Kanowski opened fire. You were seven years old. You were goin' out to the car to get your jacket when you heard the shots. By the time you came back in, it was just in time to see Kanowski use the last bullet on himself. - I should've died too. - Oh, no. I should've died too. Well, you've seen it. Now, let's get on with it. I don't suppose that there are any, uh, rules to this insane game. Fun, isn't it? Open up those Dumbo ears, Arnold, 'cause I'm only gonna explain this once. Uh, stay with me, 'cause it's pretty complicated. First, we say "go. " Then-Then we drive as fast as we can up to this little white line. Then the first person to hit their brakes loses. Now, was that clear enough for you, or do you want me to break it down again? You only got about 30 yards between the line and the edge of the cliff. Yeah, give or take. Give or take what? Twenty. You mind tellin' me how you plan to stop a car between this line and the edge of the cliff? Well, duh! Never thought about that one before. Anyone a physics major here? Let's see. Speeding object, 60-foot drop, Newton's law of gravity- I think you can figure it out from there. Any more questions? Yeah, just one. What's that? How did a jerk like you get to be president of anything? Let's drag, geek! I need you here, Al, right now. Your beloved admiral isn't here, Beckett. This time, you face your maker alone. Will you get in the car, nerd-ball? Geez.! Come on.! Oh, this is so beautiful. I'm going up for a better view. - Forgot something'. - What's that? Which pedal's the brake? The stakes. If I win, you and the Chi Kappas... have to promise that you'll stop these stupid races as part of your initiation. Have we got a deal? I don't know. I'll have to ask my brothers. I guess I misunderstood. I figured you could make that kind of a decision yourself. But I guess I was wrong. No, no, wait a minute. All right. You got a deal. One I'll never have to keep. You're not supposed to die. You weren't then, and you're not now. You've been trying to make this death wish come true with these dumbbell stunts. And sooner or later, you're gonna succeed. Then who's gonna protect the innocent? You don't have to risk your life to do good, Arnold. And you know what's amazing? You're the most innocent one of all. You were seven years old, Arnold. Seven! There's no way you could control what happened to your parents. And one more thing. Do you think your folks would have wanted it to happen this way? Do you think your mom and dad would have wished that their only son die too? Sam, I think I did it. I think I got through to Arnold. And you know what? He's really a very sensitive kid- Oh, my God. It's her. Say hello to Al. He's here? Did he do it? Sam, you gotta leap outta here. I can't control things with her changing history. Sam? I'm taking Alia with me, Al. Are you outta your mind? Go! Did you convince Arnold to stop risking his life? Yeah, but Ziggy says the odds of Arnold getting killed in an accident have dropped below 10%. - But your odds of getting killed are over 90.! - What's going on? What's Al saying? He's saying that, uh, everything's gonna work out just fine. - You're lying. - Sam, stop the car, will ya? I can't, Al. If I do that, Zoey will tell Lothos, and he'll leap her out of here. - I'll lose her forever. - Well, so lose her.! She tried to kill you.! She didn't. That's the whole point. I'm taking her with me. What if you don't? What if she takes you with her? Sam, things keep changing. Somebody cut the brake line. What are the odds of Arnold's survival, Al? Will you forget about Arnold? Just tell me. - All right. 93%. 94. 95. - Now what's he saying? Five more percent, and we're outta here. Yeah. Sam, there's a cliff comin' up in about 200 yards. You owe me nothing. You don't have any brakes.! What are the odds now, Al? Uh, 98.3 and holding. - I need 100%. - There's the finish line. Sam, you gotta get outta here.! Jump.! Jump.! Alia, we gotta bail. The brakes are gone. Ready? Go! Sam, are you all right? Alia. Oh, God. Alia. Oh, Beckett, no. Lothos, call Alia out now! Uh, 99.4, Sam. Point-five. Point-six. Fight back, Sam. I will kill you myself, Alia. Point-seven. Hang on. Point-nine! Bingo! A hundred percent. Alia? Alia? Sam? Sam? It's all right. It's all right. I'm right here. Where? Where are we? - I don't know. - Good Lord. Only a week in the box, and you don't know where you are. Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam? If you're yellin' for a three-letter savior, I suggest you make it start with a "G." I have to get out of here. Well, that's simple. All you have to do is tell me which one of you two did it. Did what? First, you act like you don't know where you are. Then you pretend you don't know why. - We don't! - Oh, you don't? Well, you better figure it out, or you're goin' back in that box. Now, ladies, which one of you murdered Carol Benning? Oh, boy. Copy. Gate's clear. We had leaped together and survived, but we still didn't know if Alia had leaped with me, or I had leaped with her. And being in a women's prison didn't make finding the answer to that any easier. Sit. Just take it easy. We'll figure this out, okay? Nobody told you to talk! I told you to sit! I need to talk to her. You got no needs. You got no wants. You got no rights. If you want answers, I suggest you let me talk to her. Now, why should I do you any favors? If I find out the truth, who's doing who the favor? Alone. Step into my office. Warden's got plans for you, Angel. Big plans.

This is unbelievable! I thought they only did ballet here now? This ¡s a music and dance benefit for refugee relief, I think. Oh, yeah? And how did you get us invited to the rehearsals? Jenny, the girl who sings backup invited me. - Why would she do that? - Because I am irresistible. Stop! Stop! I mean, why don't you just cut my microphone and let her carry the song? And the light! Frank! Carolyn, do you suppose we could finish this technical rehearsal before opening night? Who told you to turn that spot off me? Carolyn, we have enough union problems as it is. Jenny had a few featured bars, so he naturally thought... I want him fired. Either you do it or I will, Frank. Take ten, everybody. - Hey. - How are you? Well, we're having a couple of tiny little problems. - Carolyn! - Look, I want him gone. Listen, you're being really unreasonable. Really? I am just gonna fill this place in three days. This is my comeback. I sang here ten years ago, Frank, and obviously they have not forgotten. So face facts. This is my show. Oh, Really? And what are the rest of us doing here? You know, recently I haven't heard you utter one single sentence... that didn't begin with the word "I". - I made you, Frank! - I rest my case. You know, when I re-discovered you, your career was history, and you were so hungry to get back in the game you were drooling on my shoes. but there was some decency in you. And now, now you're just another ego laden bitch with an attitude. Whatever was special about you, you've murdered it. Who the hell do you think you are? I'm a very busy man with a show to run, and you are just one element in it. We'll just see about that. Hey, listen, I wanna introduce you some friends, Ok? Ok. Tessa, come here, I would like you to meet Jenny. - Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. And this here is my old friend, Duncan MacLeod. Mac? - Hi! - Nice to meet you, yes. Are you ok? - Oh no! - Oh, it's Frank! - He's no right. - Someone call an ambulance! Just, I can't believe it. I can't believe it, I mean... One minute he was right there, and then... It's ok. Jenny maybe you should come back to the barge with us. Yeah, I think is a very good idea. Okay. Then you never saw him? No, the lights were too bright. You think he ran out the door? I only felt the draft. Well, on that side of the stage, the doors are attached to an alarm. There's also a stairwell leading into the basement. There's no door down there. - Anything else? - No. What the hell are those about? Yes? I'm sorry. I'm not disturbing you, am I? No, no, no, no. - You mind if I come in here? - Sure. Are you with the police? No. I was... Oh, I'm sorry. I remember you now. Can I help you? Yeah. Did you see what he looked like? The lights blinded me, so... Wildflowers. From an admirer? I don't know. They were just here when I came in. You know, they only grow in the forest. How nice. Will you excuse me, please? - Yeah, certainly. I'm sorry. Thanks. - Sure. You think an immortal killed him? I don't know. But there was an immortal there. It's someone you think you know, isn't it? What are you hunting? A beast that bears no name, sir. A demon that dwells hereabouts. A demon? Has he horns? None sir. But when he is cut down, he doesn't die. He springs up somewhere else, like the mushrooms that grow here at your feet! It's a beast, not a man! Hurry! Leave him alone! He's doing no harm! No! - He'll rise again! You cannot kill him! - Enough! There are ways to bury him, so he will not rise again. And I know of it. Leave! Now, any man that witnesses the burial site will remain here and grow roots... forever. Go! I won't harm you. But I couldn't let you kill that man. They won't bother you. They think you're under there. But you can't stay here anymore. You understand what I'm saying to you? We must go. Now. Where was he from? How did he get there in the first place? I don't know. You never asked him? No, he had a voice, but... he didn't speak much. It's my guess Ursa grew up in the wilds... alone. He lived in a cave. We stopped there to get the few things that he owned. But what would a man who lives in a cave in the woods... be doing in the heart of Paris, at the Opera? It can't be the same person. Who is it? Who is there? My friends will be right back. Who are you? You killed Frank? He hurt you. You're not gonna hurt me like you hurt him, are you? No. Sing. Sing more. He hurt me, and you protected me. Like a guardian angel. Is that what you are? My own guardian Angel who brings me wildflowers from the forest floor. Ursa, Ursa. Yes, I remember him. He was a gardener at the Abbey of St. Cobain. Before the Revolution when they tore the Abbey down... and used the stones to build some houses. I lost track of him after that. I was hoping you had some more recent recollection. Oh, for me, that is recent. Try some of this. Oh, this isn't some more of your moss stuff, is it? No, no, no, no. I don't trust you. Are you sure is not? It's from a mold form. - Some more? - No, no, no, no, no. Look, do you remember anything else about him? The monks considered him as one of God's special creatures. They kept his secret from generation to generation. They taught him to sing. - Do you know where he came from? - No, I... no. I doubt if he knows himself. He once drew me a picture of his home of mountains and a cave. Well, strange that he should choose a monastery. None of the monks remembered how he came to be there. None of them. Listen. If you stay out here others like me will come. You'll have to take their heads or they'll take yours. You'll be safe in the abbey. Men won't bother you. And others like us cannot hurt you here. Do you understand? That's music. Men's voices. You too could sing like that. But you never saw him again? Until yesterday, I think. It's a shame about the abbey. It was his only true home. Of course now it would be in a Suburb of Paris with its own subway line. - Subway? - Yeah. Subway. Subway line. Are there any woods or parks near the site of the old abbey? A huge park actually, yeah. - Then it makes sense. - What does? Well, Ursa has always lived in caves except for his time at the Abbey. He'd be perfect at home underground. In sewers, in subways. The catacombs. Those old tunnel works were used during the great plague to empty the city's cemeteries. Yes, but what would draw Ursa so far into the city? The music! Yeah, the opera. I suppose that it's possible. Yeah, Ursa always loved music and beauty. Come in! - Wow, that's a hot stuff. - Really? - Can I talk to you? - Sure, Jenny. Well, the guys in the band have been... helping me out with a couple of songs I've been working on and... well, they think they're pretty good. Hm. I'll listen to them. And if I like them I'll try them out in rehearsal. The others thought that maybe I could sing them myself, you know. I'd like to try. I bet you would like to a try, Jenny. If they're any good, we'll try them out in performance... and see if the fans go for them, ok? Yeah, that's what I want. That's all? At your age, Jenny, I wanted to be the star. No, seriously Jenny, you deserve the recognition. - I won't forget this. - I won't let you. - Thank you. - Ok. - Bye, Jenny. - Bye. Bye. Let me just get this straight. You're going down there and look for this big giant named Ursa, who's like, prowling around the opera, you think. That's right. And I'm going on my own. Ok. So I've taken you're around when they built the Paris sewers, right? You probably know them like the back of your hand. No, I was actually not too much interested in sewers, you know? Well then, how do you know where you're going? Well, like the old saying, go as I'm going north by northwest. Well, actually, I'm going that way. What if the compass doesn't work down there? I'll get lost. And don't come after me! Right, sure. You know, great, big, dummy, giant, ugly Neanderthal, immortal, piece of... oh man! They're beautiful. You're back again. How do you get in here without anyone seeing you? - Here? - Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you. The feeling isn't mutual. I told you to stay by the manhole and cover me. Now go back. Go back? I forgot my ball of twine. You're lost? Mac, I'm wandering around this place turning like fish belly white and growing this... phosphorescent tendril out of my forehead, like some bottom dwelling sea urchin. Quiet! - What? - Voices. I'm afraid. I wouldn't have to be if... But I couldn't ask you that either. You've already protected me once. You don't like killing. I guess I'll just have to go away. Far from everyone. Far from you. And just hope she doesn't find me. Unless... You could bring her down here. No one will ever find you. Or her. She's already tried to murder me once, in my sleep. Do you want her to succeed this time? Help me! What? What is it? What, what's up? What's going on? - Oh, fantastic. - Stay here, ok? All right. It's me, Duncan MacLeod! Ursa! Ursa! Ursa! MacLeod. Ursa! You ok? Why did he attack you, if he's your friend? He didn't recognize me. It was dark. I told him who I was, but maybe he didn't remember. Yeah, I suppose the old memory gets a little fuzzy after a couple of hundred years. What's he doing down there? Why did he kill that man at the Opera? Well, that's what I'm gonna have to find out. See you. Later. - You will follow me again, won't you? - No, not this time. Friend, huh? Trust me, it's not exactly the kind of guy you invite over for dinner. - Au, Tessa! - Sorry. - Hi, Jenny, right? - Yeah. Hi. - How are you doing? - Fine, fine, thank you. Have the police been back? Questioning Carolyn, mainly. She's the only one who saw anything. You're friend of hers? Well, I guess I'd like to be. I mean, she could sing anything, you know, jazz, opera... But? Well, she can be hard to be around sometime you know. I keep telling myself that she's just scared, you know. That this is her big shot at a comeback. How did she get along with Frank? Yeah, well. I guess I shouldn't talk about that. - Why not? It might help. - How? I don't know. Well, were they close? Yeah, they were friendly, at first. And she was grateful. He always said he was her number one fan. It's funny with someone like Carolyn, you could almost see the gratitude... working like a poison in the bloodstream. She started berating there we saw Tiffany's. We loved to be on the main floor because we wanted to watch the door for all the celebrities. That was a dazzling moment, to see Judy garland. When she walked in with her new husband, she looked so happy, and to hear that famous laugh ring through the store... Who knows what she was laughing about? But what she purchased as a gift from mgm were emeralds, which made me think of "the wizard of oz." They said that was her wedding present, she could choose anything she wanted at Tiffany. This watch is incredible. This is, um, quite amazing. This is from our archive. This is fdr's last watch. Now, we've made a lot of watches for presidents and it's surprisingly small, i have to say. When you wear it, it literally sends shivers down your spine. You can see here how much he loved it and how much he wore it 'cause all of the stitching on this side is completely worn off. We have this amazing history of watch making. I found it extremely inspiring. I think my first blue box was around when i was 12 or 13. And I remember being rather disappointed on my 16th birthday when there were multiple blue boxes. And there was a large one, and I was really excited to open it up and see what was inside. It was, of course, the first box that I went for. And when I started opening it up, inside I found an etiquette book. I think my first exposure was the Tiffany's etiquette book for teenagers. I came to the U.S. when I was eight or nine, so we weren't so well-schooled on American etiquette. They were like, "this is a good book to learn from." Beyond chopsticks. My first memory of Tiffany's is... they have an etiquette guide for teenagers-- "Tiffany's table manners for teenagers." I remember the Christmas. I was probably 13, maybe 14 at the time. An etiquette book isn't what every teenager wants for Christmas. I think it's such an iconic, respected American brand so, I think parents might think that's it's a great thing to give to a young girl. -So that was a little bit of a disappointment, but-- - director] The etiquette book? Yes, the Tiffany etiquette book. But apparently, I guess i learned a few things from it. And it wasn't until i was older when I realized that I'm gonna move to New York, if I'm gonna make it in the big city, I should know which one is a salad fork, which one is the soup spoon. And so, I found myself, sneakily, stealthily, looking for that book and reading a few chapters. And I actually just bought it for my son, and he's nine, and we were at breakfast and I gave it to him and he looked at it. And he looked at me, he goes, "my name is not Tiffany and I'm not a teenager. Here you go, you can have it back." I was super lucky that for one of my birthdays my team literally captured me, blindfolded me-- they actually took me on this surprise trip and when I opened my eyes I was on the second floor of this Tiffany's and they had created this wonderful breakfast for me. So I literally had breakfast at Tiffany's. --Who--who else had a birthday? I think Katie Couric had her birthday there. -Did you know about that? -Katie Couric? No, I don't. But I'm very happy to share that experience with Katie. Katie's a very jolly lady. They let glenda baily have a party at Tiffany's? I thought i was the only one. I was turning 50 and unlike a lot of people, i love birthdays. And I love parties. It was an inside job basically, my friend Carole works at Tiffany. I was trying to find a really cool, fun, different space. We had a cocktail party on the first floor. We served tiffaninis, which looked dangerously like, um Ty-d-bol. But they were delicious. And strong. I think it will probably go down in history, my personal history, as my best birthday ever. I am a scorpio, just like Elsa peretti. And Elsa peretti of course designed this beautiful necklace which was a present from my team. And it reminds everybody that the qualities a scorpio is supposed to have. And all I can tell you is that Elsa is one of the most passionate, strong, and focused individuals I've ever had the pleasure to meet. On my wish list, of course is the scorpio. J'adore. She's divine. My first piece i wanted was the bone cuff from Elsa peretti. Oh, everybody should have a peretti Sterling cuff. I mean, I had client in here earlier today who collects peretti and was wearing a pair of peretti earrings. And it's just like, it's always good. When Elsa started at Tiffany, it was the mid 1970s. And Elsa peretti was hot, you know? I mean, she was part of halston's entourage, she was a model. She had been designing jewelry that was on the catwalks with halston and giorgio di sant' Angelo. And the jewelry was a hit. I really like the design of the Elsa peretti pieces. So for my editorial work, and also with fashion shows I've used it a lot 'cause it's some of my favorite jewelry that exists. Well, this is the first piece of jewelry that Elsa peretti designed at Tiffany-- one of the first pieces but she really designed it before she started. You know there's a necklace that's like a bud base. That an orchid could fit in. She said she designed it because when she saw the girls in Capri wearing flowers in their hair, she thought that was the most beautiful thing in the world. But she didn't want her flower to die. So she made a bottle pendant to put the flower in. And that's what it's for. But like, there's sort of a suggestion that you could also keep your drugs in there. I mean... No, like, you know. It's cool. What she able to do in terms of communicating her language and her aesthetic through jewelry, she certainly paved the way for people like myself and other jewelry designers today. And there's not a lot of places that wanna bring other designers in under their umbrella. Being a part of vogue and being a part of the c.F.D.A. Is wonderful because they really do foster new designers and help companies. You know, i can't even tell you what the last year has done for my business, just being a part of it. When I won runner-up, I got a really nice gift from Tiffany and I was in heaven. The idea of jewelry, and to succeed as a jewelry designer, I think is something that even clothing designers have aspirations for. The year Monique pean won, she was a runner-up winner she won $100,000 and her choice of mentor. Went into Anna wintour's office and she said if you could have any mentor, who would you choose? And I said, "you know if I could have anyone, I would love to be able to work with Michael Kowalski, the ceo of Tiffany." What intrigued me of course, was her intense interest in the materials that she uses. And her commitment to--to sustainability not only in terms of materials, but in terms of the folks who provide those materials. And I thought it was a--a wonderful story, and I think it's relevant for luxury today. Rather than taking from the earth, finding things that you can reinvent, fossils are so incredible because they're almost like nature's photographs. And that they're able to tell a story through time. And I use a lot of fossilized woolly mammoth and fossilized dinosaur bone. This is fossilized woolly mammoth, the cream parts that have been trapped in the ice over tens of thousands of years. And then in the center is fossilized woolly mammoth the root of the tooth and the salt minerals over 35,000 years changed the color to these deep blues. And then in the middle is fossilized dinosaur bone. That's from the Jurassic period and 150 million years old. In jewelry designing, talented new artists like Jean schlumberger originated labyrinth ideas, which are the despair of manufacturers who serve the mass market. I love the, um... One of my favorites is the--shit. I can--can never pronounce him. "Schlum--sumberger." - "Schlum-ber-Jay." -Schlumberger. Mm-hmm. Yup, make them Jewish. - "Schlum-burger." "Schlum-burger?" Oh, my god. That's so embarrassing. - You corrected her, right? I mean, you got-- of course, the... Oh, my god, why am I thinking of "Cho-ba-Jay"? "Show-ba-Jay." I'm saying it wrong. - Well, it's like-- -it's close. - "Schlum-ber-Jay. " -And they brought out the broach, and they said, "this is "schlum-ber-Jay." Is that how it's pronounced? - Well, it's like-- -it's close. - "Schlum-ber-Jay." -Schlumberger. "Sean--schlumberger." The schlumberger-- these are heirlooms. These are family heirlooms, and they are from the 1940's. They're early schlumberger. I love the schlumberger pieces. Whenever I go in to the Tiffany store, that's where I go and just sort of pet the cabinets and... And drool. --The seahorse is one of the very first schlumberger pieces that I bought. He really was attracted to themes in nature. What he's most known for are the schlumberger enamel bracelets. Jackie Kennedy used to wear them all the time. And those are fantastic. I'm really a fan of big, big, big pieces. This broach I'm sup-- I'm really partial to. I used to read Elizabeth Taylor, my love affair with jewelry." It was my very favorite piece in the book, and I thought I always wanted it, and then when this came up for auction-- I think it went for about $1 million. - Yes. - $550,000 then, and selling. $550,000. At $6,300,000 then. Here we are... Sold for you, sir. $7,800,000. --Thank you very much. I thought, "well, I'm never gonna get the Elizabeth Taylor one." And so, I got this and I think it was... Don't quote me. Like $60,000 or $70,000. But there's only six of these. This one was made in the 80s. The designs that we have, we don't change. We try and recreate. Some designs were never made. Some sketches were only part-sketched. And sometimes you have to guess. But it's all in what he left. There's nothing that's being adapted or changed. -Diamonds... Are a girl's best friend. -Are a girl's best friend, and what better night to sparkle than on Oscar's? Thank goodness. Thank goodness for Tiffany and co. Look at this. Look how gorgeous. To die. -And by the way- you can't take it- ...this is one of her favorite pieces. -... From her. I know, well we brought that after she was, uh- yeah, she was- she went right to that and was really drawn to that. Yeah, she'll be very excited about that. -So, we wanted to make-- -and so am I. Which we, of course, are also partial to because it's so close to the Tiffany blue color. Oh, right, got it. Jessica biel here on the red carpet. Hi. How are you? There you are. -How are you? -I'm well, thank you. -Good to see you. -Good to see you too. So, tell me about your dress. Let's start with the e! Fashion. -Okay. -Yes. -This is Chanel couture. -Mm-hmm. And I'm basically just decked -head to toe in Tiffany's. -You've got arm candy but not your other arm candy. -He's out on tour, isn't he? -Yes. Yes, out on tour, busy working. I'm watching it on TV with PR's and other stylists. - Yeah. - With other stylists? Yeah, I have a couple stylists I'm friends with in L.A. So we usually watch it together. Oh, it's so mean. It's awesome. Everybody's trashing everybody except their clients. - Everyone? Really? -Yeah, you have to be really careful. Let's just get it on the table, who did who, and let's all be nice. Yeah, I mean, what do you do when you watch the oscars? You comment on what everybody's wearing. You know? And it's-- it's a great, fun TV moment. Oh, it's amazing. I'm a great commentator. - And I do have-- - you're a hater, too? I am not a hater. It's not from hate. It's from the desire to not be mediocre and to really have incredible style. And to take all these incredibly beautiful pieces and things that people are creating and to really celebrate them. And not in a silly way. In the old days when they did celebrate beauty, I mean, when Liz Taylor won an award, Liz was fabulous and I would hope that we would get back to that day. 'Cause those were incredible days. At Hollywood's pantages theatre it's the motion picture industry's night of nights, and the film capital's top stars turn out for the annual presentation of the coveted oscars. Jessica! Jess! Jessica, I need those eyes! The right piece on the right celebrity is the best p.R. You can't buy that p.R. It's, uh, a photograph that is seen worldwide. Um, one photograph is picked up by countless blogs and you are focusing on that jewelry. The dress, yes, but the jewelry really makes that photograph. And the accessories really make that outfit. And at the end of the day, the dress is easily knocked off. The jewelry is priceless, it's invaluable. And people know that jeweler. It's like--it reminds me of mineral in the ocean. It's different 'cause... It's kind of like a motto. Jewelry stores don't really have a theme to what they do. Besides Tiffany, no other stores really have, like, a theme to their jewelry. It's all just tropical. When you're young, you want to wear a diamond. You're gonna want to wear-- when you're old and you get divorced, like, five times, you don't--you don't need any of that stuff. Well, ultimately, we're talking about a jewelry store. How it is this pop-culture kind of... circular weirdness. All women everywhere know that song. - Do they really? -Yeah. You can go ask any woman you pass on the street and they'll--they know that song. So when this ends up on the cutting room floor of this film-- this'll make it. Just let us know 'cause we got stories about Carlyle. The Carly-- yeah, I lost my virginity in the Carlyle. -Oh, shut up. -With Elaine stritch. The music video was filmed, like, right here I actually wrote it on this guitar. I had an actress throw out a pair of earrings. Like, it makes me sick to my stomach. They were in tissue, and she cleaned her room and looked everywhere and said, "i think I threw them out." 'Cause she's paranoid that she's a celebrity and doesn't want to leave a messy room 'cause then the housekeeping will say she's a slob. And she totally threw them out. Well, there aren't many ways you can get a lotta, like, well-known names... - Free in a film. -Ah! [speakingSwedish]. Iamnothavingthis ! How's it going, bros? It's PewDiePie.

I told you the inoculation might have some side effects. How about a toast? You know I'm not big on speeches, so, um... May you all live long lives. Cheers. Prost, salut, viva, bud'mo, skol. L'Chaim! God. That's just wrong. I'm sorry, guys. I only had $20 on me. I really... And when you say "may you all have long lives," that kinda sounds like there won't be any more missions. Well, we may have done what we came here to do... created a future where we're no longer needed. All we have to do is... live out our lives. These lives, I mean. Protocol 5. Indefinitely. Afternoon. Come with me. What's up? This has always been solid, right? Between me and you. Are you breaking up with me? No, I'm serious, man, I'm in trouble. What kind of trouble? What you got on this afternoon? More of that. Not anymore. I need your help. Well, tell me what's going on! You've been dropping off the grid left and right lately, and I haven't asked one single question. Now, you're my partner, right? And I trust you. Do you trust me? Of course I do. All right. Let's go. It's okay. It's okay. I know. I know. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I really don't know how you stand this either. None of this fits. I think I'm getting fat. I don't think you understand the meaning of the word. Well, either I'm getting fat or my boobs got bigger. Can you come in here a sec? Actually, no, I don't think that's a good idea. I'm not supposed to... Come in here. I need your help. Rene, the lady's right there, - and she could... - Okay. Look at all this stuff. I've got so much good shit. Look at this. Open back. And these pants. Aren't they perfect? Yeah, they're really pants. 'Kay. Open your coat. - What? - We got to go. Open your coat! I can't fit this all in my purse. You don't actually, um, want to steal all this stuff? Well, not all of it. Rene, don't. Come on! You love this stuff! Help me. Do you have these in a size 13? It's hard for me to find good shoes. I really like these kicks. Do you think you could maybe take a look, like, in the back? In the back. Sure. I thought this stuff got you hot. Come on. It gets me hot. Come on, look, Rene, I'm gonna have to admit a bit of confusion at this point, okay? Hey! That's illegal! So's that. - Hey! - Hey! Wait! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! The Director's gonna make you pay for this. Excuse me? You're paying for what they stole. Aw, shit. Hey, Phil. Phil? Hey, Phil. Come on, man. Don't make me chase you. What's up? I thought you were off of that shit. What am I, getting you the Percs just for show? What do you want, Ray? Why don't you let me take you home? Come on, man. I'm going for a walk. Yeah. I can see that. Don't have any bets for you today. Forget about the bet. You're scaring the children. Boo. Sorry. Come on, let's go. Walt, what are we doing? - What is this? - Just keep it reined in. These guys don't mess around. Stop where you are! Eyes front! Put the bag down! Weapons down! Put 'em on the ground! Okay, we're doing it! Seriously? It's gonna be all right. Get your hands in the air. Above your head! Eyes front! Sorry about that, Mac. Let's go. Surprise! Easy there. You son of a bitch. You've got some new moves, Mac. Jesus, man, I could've broken something. Yeah, I'm fine. You still got no chill, man. Congratulations, partner. And thanks for the assist with the propane. 15 years and they can still surprise you? Congratulations. I swore to myself I would never eat this shit again. Well... the body needs fuel, man. When was the last time you had like a proper meal? All I ever see you eat is Coke and Twinkies. When did you start caring about my health? You see, that's your problem, right there. Probably all you've ever had is junkies for friends, right? You never had anyone just lookin' out for you 'cause they care. You only care because I give you bets. Yeah, your special abilities, they play a fundamental part in our relationship, that's for sure. But I'm buying you lunch 'cause I'm a goddamn humanitarian. Hey, Marce? In here. Hey, I couldn't remember if you liked the green apples or the red apples, so I just... Jesus Christ. What? What the hell are you doing? Just a minor surgery. Nothing serious. What have you done to yourself? I've installed a vagus nerve stimulator in order to minimize my seizures. Normal people don't operate on themselves, Marcy. The Terminator, maybe, but that's it. This is minimally invasive. Don't worry, I'll clean up the mess. It's not about the mess. The fact that you would do something like this alone is insane. Well, you would've made me go to the hospital. Yes! Surgery? Yes! I mean, look at this place! It's just a little bit of blood. No, it's not. No, it's not! This... This is a great deal of blood! How... How do you not... How do you not recognize this? I mean... Come on! I can't... I can't keep doing this. Doing what? Pretending that this is normal. And it's not just this, it's everything. I mean, it's... it's the staying out late all night without telling me where you are, it's CPR during phone conversations, it's the... how about the phone message saying that you might be relocating? "Another time, another life"... what... And please stop kissing me to just to shut me up. That's not fair. Do you want me to leave? No. No. It's... do you know what it is? Stop trying to do everything alone. Let me in. Let me help you with the battle. Because I can't help but think that whatever it is you're doing... it's a battle. Would you have helped me with this? God, no. No. But... I am here for you for anything and everything non-surgical. Okay, maybe, like, minor surgery, like... Band-Aids. I can do Band-Aids. All right, get him up here. Come on, let's go. Yeah, get his jacket. No... Take your jacket off. Come on, everyone, let's hear it for him! Why? Why are you taking my jacket? It's fine. You'll be fine. Special Agent Grant MacLaren. In recognition of your many years of dedication to this Bureau, the men and women of this division would like to present you with... this token of our appreciation. Here's to 15 years, bruh. Come on! Hold it up. - What are you doing? - No, no, no, no. Come on. Here we go. Yo, Kat, take a picture. Yeah. Of course. I can't get in. Just swipe up. Did you... Did you change it? All right. Let's do this. Big smiles! Come on, man. Hey. It's okay. We're just gonna play it extra safe today, okay? Okay? Shit. Hey, Walt. Hey, sweetheart. How are you? Good. Thanks so much for putting this together for him. It means a lot. Yeah, he's all right. So how are things? You look good. Everything's fine now? Yeah, unless you know something I don't. No, it's just that Mac told me that he took you to the doctor's the other day. You know what? It's none of my business. I never should've said anything. No, no, no, it's fine. It wasn't anything serious. Well, I'm glad to hear it. Yeah, everything's good. We're good. - Should I top you up? - Yes, please. There you go. I'm really sorry. Hey! What the hell was that in there? Well, I don't know, dawg, you tell me, because you really botched it in there! - I did? - Yeah! Was I getting you all worked up? No! It was... It was a terrible plan. No, no, it wasn't a terrible plan! - Yeah! It was! - It's your plan. No, it wasn't my plan! It's your plan, Trevor! We've done it 10 times! All right? You're killing me out here, man. You are so off your game today. What are these? Benzos. Your favorite. This is my mother's medication. Trevor. How did you get this? Are you kidding? Man, don't even. Are you stealing from my family? You told me to! No, I didn't tell you to! Look, man... just give me the pills. No, I'm not giving you the pills. Just be fair and give me the pills, all right? I gave you the last stash! We had a deal, bitch! Come on, chill out, guys. Come on, Trevor. Your head is still healing. I'm not in any danger. No, you're right. Just give me back the pills, and you won't be. Walk away. Trevor! Don't. Trevor! Yeah, screw you! What? Are you okay? Wha...? Okay, just sit back. Close your eyes. What is this even supposed to do? This... is connected to a nerve in your head. No, it's not. You know reflexology's not real medicine. Okay. Next you're going to tell me that the hip bone's not connected to the leg bone. It isn't. All right, you know what? I'm j... I'm trying to help you relax, so just play along. Okay. Close your eyes. What happened here? It's nothing. It's just a reaction from an injection. An injection of...? An antitoxin. An antitoxin for...? Marcy... you're seeing things. What do you mean? The psychotropic effects of the antitoxins. You've been experiencing them all day, kiddo. An antitoxin for what? Sorry, I shouldn't have said anything. I'm just... I'm just experiencing some side effects. Did you have anything to do with that huge explosion at Van Huizen? You know about that? Well, it was the first mushroom cloud we've had in the area in what seems like forever. It was all over the news. They said it was a combination of spilt chemicals that accidentally combined with... I mean, why am I telling you? You were there. They did say it was just an accident, though. They evacuated the area in time, and no one was hurt. Marcy. Marcy. Marce? Marcy? Marcy, look at me. Hey, MacLaren. Mac. Mac. We're talking about the time that we had to evac out of the south shelter. Yeah. The emergency alarm goes off, reveille bell's ringing bloody murder... People screaming... And who comes walking in but 3468... "Shit! That warrant was in that other coat!" There you are, man. Where's your drink at? No, no, I've had enough. Don't quit on me now, Mac. You'll need courage for your speech. Nobody wants to hear me talk. Who wants to hear Mac's speech? No! Shh! I got to take a piss. I'll be back. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Just have some Scotch. Isn't this a great party, people? You know what you need? Something to love. It ain't good for a guy to sit around that garage all day... you know, no sunshine, no companionship, no girlfriend. You got a boyfriend? It's not a priority either way. What about a pet? You need something to talk to other than your computer or yourself. I've heard dog is a man's best friend. A puppy? Yeah, right. That's much better! Puppy's a lot of commitment, Phil. It takes a whole lot of effort. You got to pick up their shit. They bark all the time. You can't travel anywhere. A professional gambler like you, you got to be able to pick up and fly to Vegas at any time, right? Right? Thanks, Ray. She's cute. You're welcome. Look at her. All right. There's one more place I want to take ya. You okay? Yeah. I think so. Come on, I thought you were gonna kick that guy's ass. Yeah, well, look, Rene, I'm sorry if who I am doesn't work for you anymore, okay? No, I like who you are. To be honest... I was never really into that other stuff anyways. I kind of just played along. Really? True story. Okay, come on, let me show you something. Come with me. I think you're gonna like this. I know there's a camera here somewhere. Don't worry. I won't let them hurt you. Okay? No. It was a complete waste of time. I'm gonna have to cut it all out again. No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. Slow down. Take a breath. I am so tired. I know. You really want to help me? Anything. Not anything. You said no surgery. Yeah, well, I'm not gonna operate on you. I mean, that's where I draw the line. Sorry. It's more of a procedure. A simple one. Well, see, now, how simple? Because you said the last one was minor. You can do this. I know you can. I wanted to ask you for a while, but I was afraid that you'd say no. Okay. What do you want me to do? I know that you're staring at me. How? Because I'm highly trained. How do you do that? Clear your mind? Most of the time, it's easy. But today I'm finding it a bit difficult. Am I distracting you? A lot's changed the last little while. What? Talk to me. I thought my life had purpose. And then, one day, I woke up almost surprised to be alive, and... I found out that my purpose was gone. Everything that I've been doing... has been focused on this one mission. And now that there's no mission... I'm just living a stranger's life. It must be hard not to be able to play football... But... just so you know... I was never with you 'cause you were some superstar quarterback. Really? No. It was the size of your dick. I'm kidding. - Well... - I'm kidding. But honestly... even if that's not your mission anymore... You're still gonna be someone great. There's the 15-year man! - Come on. - Hey! Now, I was pretty reluctant to do any of this, because, let's be honest, he's a pretty lousy partner, but enough about his squash game. Let's hear it for our colleague and our friend, Special Agent Grant MacLaren. Yeah! Thanks a lot. Thanks, partner. Um, it's a great afternoon. Isn't it? A lot of familiar faces here. I can't tell you how strange it is to know that... I'll never see any of you again. Until Monday, I mean, Monday... Um, so many stories from our past... So many I can't talk about. Teamwork... is everything, right? The people you work with... they become your family. A shared history, a shared mission... that's... that's what you hold onto. I, and-and my actual family, my-my wife, Kathryn... She-She holds me up. Probably literally tonight. Jesus. - No, no. Oi. - Come on! Come on! All right. 15 more years! Woo! Thanks. Hey, maybe you should drive home. Let's go. Get in here! Just... What's going on? Why don't you tell us? I... Trevor, why did you steal my medication? I didn't steal your medication. Well, it sure as hell didn't get up and walk away on its own! Okay, okay! Look, Nick stole it. Nick? What the hell was Nick doing in our bathroom? He was under the mistaken impression that I wanted him to take it. Jesus! What are you doing? You're lying, you're stealing, and now you're doing drugs? No, I'm not doing drugs. Well, you look you're high right now! I'm not high. I... Take responsibility! Be a man, for Christ's sake! What? Like you, Gary? That kinda man? I told you the truth. Here's your medication. Trevor! L5. Right there. Right there, between L4 and L5. This is insane. I can't do this without you. You've already frozen the site. It won't hurt as much as you think. Okay, okay... God, I'm sorry. You're going good. You're doing good. Keep going. God, I... I felt a pop. I'm sorry. Something popped. No, it's good. Keep going. Okay. Yeah? Okay. Really? How much of this goes in? That's good. Okay. God, it's starting to leak. You're doing really good. Keep going. Not really. I'm kind of fainting over here. Done? These used to be your favorite. Okay. Shit. Okay... I need to start analyzing the C.S.F. No. No. Not now. Not now. Rest. Just... Just rest. It's... pretend-doctor's orders. Looks clean. What do you want? Is this the residence of Ms. Shannon? Who wants to know? I'm Jacqueline Peele with Child Protective Services. Ms. Shannon, it would be much better if we had this conversation inside. Ms. Shannon, I just have... - Why are you here? - A few questions for you. I'm just here responding to some concerns that were raised about Jeffrey's situation here. Where is this coming from? Your husband. Jeff is not my husband. He's the father, and we're obligated to follow up. What're you writing? Just my observations. Ms. Shannon, are you in some kind of trouble? Who are you, really? I beg your pardon? Who sent you? Who are they? What do they want from me? I've already told you, I'm with Child Protective Services. Do you have a warrant to be here? A court order of some kind? No. This is, an informal meeting, but if you want me to leave... Yes. I do. Now. All right. I will have to make a note that you refused this initial... - Get out. - Meeting, Ms. Shannon. Walt seems good. Yeah, he's a machine. He said that you've been paying more attention to me lately. Well, that's not so bad, is it? It's not true. What's not true? He said you left work early to take me to an appointment? I did? No, Grant, you didn't. So what were you really doing? W-When? What were you really doing when you were supposed to be taking me to the doctor? I'm not an idiot, Grant. I've noticed the changes. The diet, locking me out of your cell phone. Something's going on. Tell me. Tell me. I'm not who you think... What? You're not what? Tell me! I'm in love with you. I always have been. No. Stay. I'm Colin, and I'm an addict. Hi, Colin. We'd like to welcome a newcomer. Would you please introduce yourself? The kid's shy. That's okay. Then why don't you start? I admitted I was powerless over my addiction. I give over my will and my life to the Director. And I pray for the knowledge of the Director's will for me... and the power to carry it out. The Director doesn't know. Thank you, Traveler 7294. I'm Traveler 3326. I've been in the 21st century for five weeks now, and I'm so fricking tired, I just wanna lie down and get high. The other day, we saved the world. Now what do I do? I was selected and trained to remember everything. Everything... dates, coordinates, candidates, people. Every death. Every single one. But I can't even remember my own face... the face I was born with hundreds of years from now. But I guess that's okay. Because that's who I am now... and I'd better get used to it, right? I'm Philip, and I'm from the future. Go ahead and say it loud, kid. That's all you got to do. Makes a difference. My name is Philip, and I'm a heroin addict. Hi, Philip. _ You do some redecorating? What happened to Protocol 5 indefinitely? Can't Trevor and Philip be friends? You're at least a hundred years older than me. Well, I'm young at heart. Not so much. Look, I need a couch to crash on. That I believe. Mi casa es su casa. Thank you. It's been a weird day. You have any side effects from the antitoxin? Hallucinations? Voices? Yeah. Happens to me all the time, actually. Really? Yeah. That's some shit you deal with. I think it's starting to wear off. Yeah. Me too. What is it? We just received a new mission. We're back on. Previously on This is Us... You took the sourest lemon that life has to offer. and turned it into something resembling lemonade. I'm starting to feel like you attaching yourself to something that's not a calculated act is just too much for your empty human shell to handle. And that's our cue to leave. Where'd they go? Uh, they left. My car! Is that Sloane in your bed? Hey, Kate. - You're so pretty. - Thank you, baby. Well, if I'm pretty, you're pretty, 'cause we look alike. I've got to get a handle on myself, on the weight, and on all of it. I need that more than anything right now, and I want it. I want it more than anything right now. Even more than me? You and William have known each other for Randall's entire life, and you kept that from him? You kept that secret for 36 years. That must have been incredibly lonely. No. Not yet. I'll see you at Christmas. Did we overdo it? It's like a toy factory under there. I'm not really sure what kind of message that sends. That we have three kids and I work really hard. It's fine. Mom, are we going caroling? Yes, we will. Hey, Kate, stop counting presents. Mommy, my tummy hurts. I bet it does. I saw that open package of cookies in the kitchen that was supposed to be for Santa's stomach, - and not yours. - Pow, pow, pow! - Hey, stop horsing around! - Guys. Mom, Kevin took my money from Grandma. No, I didn't. It's over there on the table. Why do you even care? - You're too cheap to spend anything. - Kev. When we're older, I'll be rich. And you won't have anything, and you'll have to live in a box. Enough money talk. You guys realize that Christmas is not just about presents and getting things, right? You guys know that. Hey, why don't you guys tell your mother what Christmas is about, huh? Please. It's about Jesus stuff. "Jesus stuff." That's it. We are going to church. Probably a good idea. Yes. We're going. My tummy really hurts. Baby, that is not getting you out of church. We'll go caroling when we get back. I don't know, babe. She-she's really burning up. Mommy, I'm scared. I know, baby, I know, but everything's gonna be fine. I promise you. You're gonna be asleep, and they take out appendixes every day here. It's like... pulling a tooth. But that hurts. Yeah, that was a terrible example. Um, can you stop for a second? I have an idea. Uh, everyone hold hands. I'll be right back. Come on, guys, hands. Hey, baby. This branch-- do you see this branch? This branch has Christmas magic on it. Nothing bad ever happens on Christmas Eve. Say it. Nothing bad happens on Christmas Eve. Now, I'm gonna hold on to this for you, and when you wake up, all of us are gonna be waiting for you, and guess what. It's gonna be Christmas. - Okay. I love you. - Thanks, guys. I love you. Thanks. Good Mommy. Yeah. - Okay. - Kev? Bud? Kev? Hold on a sec, bud. Thanks, guys. Sorry. It's scary, but she's gonna be okay, I promise you. I think we're gonna be here for a little bit, so why don't I go try and find us some good snacks. I worked in this hospital 40 years. I know you have a stash of decent blankets. Dr. K? I thought I recognized that voice. Oh, hey, you. Yeah, it's been a while. Nine years. Ooh. What's... happening? What's all this about? I was rushing to get to the airport, hit some ice. Wrapped my old LeSabre around a lamppost. Ooh. How about you? You just come for the food? No. Uh, our little Kate... appendectomy. Oh, no. And on Christmas Eve. Well, don't worry about it; it's routine stuff these days. Yeah, thank you. I know. Where is your family? They on their way? Uh, Montana; that's where we go. I mean, they're-they're trying, but weather being what it is, they wouldn't get here in time to say good-bye anyway. Good-bye? I don't, I don't really understand. You seem okay. Yeah, well... it's internal. A slow hemorrhage between the heart and a lung. Can't they operate? Well, I'm sure they'll try, but don't let this flattering hospital lighting fool you, Rebecca, I'm old. And the odds of digging around in me without causing either a massive stroke or a bleed-out are close enough to zero to pass for it in any math I know of. No, come on. Th-They're gonna fix him. I don't know, Jack. Who's Dr. K? Uh, he's the doctor who delivered Kevin and Kate. If it weren't for him, we never would have found you. So he's kind of responsible for our family. And tonight... we're gonna be his. Thank you. It's not just a coincidence. The only reason you delivered our kids was because our doctor's appendix burst, and now Kate's appendix brought us all back here. On Christmas Eve, of all nights. You trying to wax poetic on me? I'd rather you wax that mustache. 'Cause if your musings on the great circle of life are gonna be the last things I ever hear, dear God, take me now. You're not going anywhere, okay? Y-You're gonna be fine. And, Jack, I am very excited that you became a doctor in the years since we talked, but you don't have to say that. You said it so many times to us. From the looks of things, I was right. Yeah. Are you scared? Rebecca. Scared? Of the great beyond? Well, now, I-I am on quite a bit of morphine here, so that does have to be taken into account, but, uh... no. I guess I would say curious. I remember the first time I walked up on the edge of the Grand Canyon. It's been pretty well talked up, so my expectations were mighty high. But still, it, uh... it did not disappoint. Not a bit. Mount Rushmore I could take or leave. No, I mean it. If the great beyond is no more impressive than the oversized mugs of four old white men, hell, I can see that in my Wednesday golf group. If I want to pray, which one works the best? Well, in the end, I'd say they all get the job done just fine. So the old man is nearly gone at this point. And I'm there with his wife, and their kids are crying, you know, just waiting for the end. The guys says, barely above a whisper-- I mean, you can hardly hear him-- "Let me go. I want to go." Well, his wife is... in tears, and leaning over him, and she says, "Yes, go, my love. We'll be okay. You can go." The old man wheezes out, "No, I can't. You're standing on my damn catheter." Hey, sweetheart. Do you want to come in? I take it you're Randall. My dad said you're the reason they adopted me. So thank you. Well, would you look at that. Aw. That is a fine snow globe. I love that. Thank you, Randall. But, you know, the only thing I did that day was nudge a man in a direction he already wanted to go. If at some point in your life, you find a way to show somebody else the same kindness that your parents showed you, that's, uh, well, that's all the present I'll need. But I sure do like this snow globe. Yes, sir. You know, I'll bet you that's just what my Montana cabin looks like, right this minute. It lights up. It does? Come show me. Well, would you look at that. So it does. I'll be darned. They can't cancel our play on Christmas Eve. Who does that? What did you think would happen? Our lead actress vanished a month ago, off the face of the planet, rode away from your cabin, so thank you very much. "Thank you very much"? What did I do? You got involved with her. You slept with the Tony-nominated star of my play and ruined everything. Yeah, well, you know, I slept with you, too. It didn't ruin anything. Yeah, only ten years of therapy. I came to New York specifically to do this play. My play. And now, because of you, I have to go to Hanukkah dinner at my parents' house and tell them and my perfect sister that the play isn't happening-- years of hearing that I'd never be a playwright, and then finally I was, but now I'm not. I'm sorry, okay? Really, I'm sorry. - What can I do? - Come to dinner with me. Oh, thanks, yeah, but I have this Christmas what? - Like I killed your puppy. - ♪ My love's not through ♪ ♪ With you yet ♪ ♪ oh, don't forget ♪ [cheers and applause] Thank you! - Whoa! - Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

I should be too modern or whatever to care about something as banal as divorce is, but I feel really bad about it, and she doesn't acknowledge it. She just expects me to hop on board, and that really pisses me off. - lt can't be easy for her. - l know this is gonna sound immature, but it'd be really helpful if you didn't take her side right now. God. I so don't want to be here. - Mom! - oh, honey. - Have you seen Zoe and Jake? - oh, they're young. They're fine. There he is. There's Jake. We'll-we'll look around for Zoe. - No, I'm not leaving here without her. - oh, honey, honey, honey. Go home, run a salt bath, light some candles. Lavender has a calming effect. - l don't want to be calm! - of course you do! [knocking] - Yeah? - Uh, Jake's in his room, and Zoe called and said she'll be home a little bit later. - They hate me. - lt's difficult for kids to- to accept that their parents are human. Prone to imperfections like everyone else. You were miraculous today, by the way. [door clicks shut] [goose honking] - You should see this place in the fall. - "The wild gander leads his flock through the..." both: "Cool night. Ya-honk!" [laughter] - l can't believe you have Whitman memorized. - Why is that? - Well, you don't really seem like the poetic type. - [laughs] You're kind of a snob, you know that? - [laughs] No, not really. But... oh, yeah, I guess so. Sorry. - Well, Whitman happens to be my favorite. - I love the part when the child asks what a- a blade of grass is. - And he calls it the beautiful uncut hair of graves. - You're a surprising human being, you know that? - You're kind of surprising yourself. [car door shuts] [door clicks open] - Zoe. What happened today was- - Yeah, I don't want to talk about it. - l know-l just want you to know that it wasn't- - But that you're still married. Yeah. - Your dad asked me for the divorce, not the other way around. - Can you blame him? [chickens clucking] [soothing melodic music] ♪ ♪ Hello. oh, my God! I, um... [laughs] I am so sorry. - Perhaps you haven't seen a penis before after all. Would you give us just a minute? - Zoe, this is Jazz. - [laughs] Hi. - Hey. - There's a beer up at the house if you want to grab one. - Sounds good. - Come here. I want to show you something. It's okay. Relax. I've been working on this for months. It keeps evading me. See, I started off, and I wanted to create a heart, but I couldn't get the two sides to balance. So I cut the clay in half, and I made that, that teardrop. But I couldn't figure out what to do with the other half of the clay. Then your mother showed up with your brother and you, and I realized the other half of the heart was supposed to be the wing of a bird, open for flight. See, sometimes... Sometimes in art, like in life, you have to accept the fact that your- things aren't going right, and you don't quite know where you're going, and you have to accept that because that's when transformation can happen. You know, I heard what you said to your mother last night. - ooh. Well, l-l was upset. - Yeah. You were also cruel, but you will transform that as well. - Hi. - Hi. - Beautiful home. - Thank you very much. - Wow. - My workshop. - Do people actually sit in those? - They do. You want to try it? - [laughs] No. - oh, come on. Where's your spirit of adventure? - I think I exhausted it yesterday. - oh, here I was hoping you were just getting started. - I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't even know you. - What do you want to know? ow. [laughter] oh! - Just a little bit. Perfect. - okay. - Don't look directly into the lens, just... Right. - Look at you. - Ready. Look at me. - At you? - Look at me. - okay. Good? - When did you decide to become a butcher? - l worked on my father's farm as a kid, and he taught me the basics, and Mr. Fleisher gave me the job in high school, and I came back to work for him after college. - Why did you come back? - Well, my dad, he lost his farm. - Market's getting harder for the family farm. - lt wasn't that. He, uh-he was a good businessman, yeah. - Then what was it? - Well, he refused to plant GMos. Right, they're genetically modified organisms or seeds, and the farm next to him, well, they did, and basically, their seeds blew over into his crop. So next thing you know, he's sinking thousands of dollars into litigation because these men- these corporations, they own the rights to these seeds; they're taking him to court. I mean, it makes no sense. You wouldn't believe the shit they pulled. Anyway, now I just want to be a part of a business that saves farms like his. - That's quite a lengthy response. It's gonna take some- some editing. Um, I'm gonna play something for you, and I'd like you to respond. Why did you get so mad at cole the butcher? - The answer's in the question. - What does that mean? - lt means, he butchers animals for a living. So I have no patience for people who have no compassion for anything outside of themselves. - Do you have a response? - You still feel that way? All right, well, I'm gonna get back to work. - l'm sorry, okay? - You had no right. - l didn't think he'd react that way. I just thought that the conflict would be interesting. - You know what, Jake? Conflict isn't interesting. But you had no right to use that for your video. - Film. - No, video. Real filmmakers don't need cheap stunts to make good films. - Zoe, I messed up, okay? People mess up. You mess up. Remember that time your Barbies tried my soldiers for crimes against humanity, and then you had them all decapitated? - This is different, Jake. This involves real people. - Hey, you thirsty? - Yes. [laughter] - I don't understand your relationship with her. - Who? Your mom? - Yes, my mom. - Well, Grace is a little intense, but her heart's in the right place, you know? You're not around. Neither are the kids. She's alone. - Thank you. - She's got no other family. - Yeah, what about her minions of lovers? - Ah, I think they just distract her from the fact that she feels very much like she's by herself. - You think that's my fault? - No, I don't. I think it runs much deeper than her relationship with any one person. - My mom gave me this. It was my grandmother's. Go. Good. [chickens clucking] - Well, I never thought I'd see the day when you're doing farmwork. - This isn't a farm. It's your weird backyard. Uh, oh, God. That's disgusting. - Why? It's-it's chicken poop. It makes the best fertilizer. And... Speaking of fertilization, guess what tonight is. Full moon! - oh, no, no. - Zoe's really excited about it. - No, absolutely not, no. - oh, it is a sacred ritual. - No, she has to take Jake on his date with Tara. She has to chaperone him. Uh-uh. - Diana, honey. Don't be a cock-block, okay? He creates enough obstacles on his own. - Mom, could you please not say "cock-block"? [all chanting] Luna, Luna, Luna, Luna-na-na.

[all howling] [howling continues] [dog howling] - Look, I'm sorry for what I said last night. - You're not still mad at me? - No, you're, um... Are a bird now or a wing. I don't really know what that means, but I think it has something to do with you making a new life and me getting over it. Well, you coming? - No. - lt would mean a lot to Grace. - When I- when I met the Dalai Lama... Gorgeous man, by the way. - Uh-huh. - He told me the artist must look with the heart. - Ahh. - Ah, Diana, your sisters welcome you. - Hi! - Welcome! Join us! - Who wants to play a game? - Huh? - Always. - Truth or lies. Here are the rules. Someone tells a story, and then everyone says if they think it's true or false. - And if you're wrong? - Then you take a shot of tequila. - Ah! - And the winner gets her stomach pumped? - You do what feels right for you. - Don't be a lightweight. [laughter] - Like, people in general are too hard on each other. Everyone's trying their best, you know? There's enough violence in this world without us fighting all the time. And that's- - Cut. This lighting just really isn't working for me. - We can stop. It's fine. - These damn technical malfunctions. - We can try it another time. - okay. So you want me to leave? - Why would I want you to leave? - So... [nervous squeal] What do you want to do? - l was all prepared to be interviewed. So I guess you're gonna have to figure something out... or we could listen to music. - Sweet, yeah. Let's put on some tunes. - Yeah. - There I was, naked as a jaybird, just a wreath of flowers in my hair. I walk in. I say, "Excuse me. I didn't know this was the men's room." - True. - True. - False! False! - No, it's true. - Lie. - What? - oh, I'm right then. - l was not wearing any flowers.

Everybody plays. [chattering and laughter] - Uh, okay. I was-l was, ah- accidentally, when I was in college, I found myself at a gay bar, and I danced with a woman. - oh! True. - And... - True? - False. - okay, there was no dancing...

It's Grete and Ole from child welfare. I'm coming! Hi. - Hi. Why isn't he in the school? - He's a little sick. Why doesn't he sleep in his room? - He did, but... How will this all look in the resumption of the process? Resumption? It is enough. - What are you talking about? Your ex-husband has got a new lawyer who believes, that only one party has been heard. You know what he has done! - He believes the evidence is too weak. He thinks it's strange that you are the only witness. - He tried to throw him out the window! What do I do? - Do not lie about why Anders isn't in school. Ole, we have to go. Took your folder? We are following up closely, and the right attaches greatly emphases our assessment. Torstein, can you put on a movie instead? Hi. - Hi. Doesn't it work? I heard something that I do not understand. It was a sound that wasn't from my son. I forgot to tell... - What? You have probably heard the sound from another baby monitor. You can hear the other's sound? - Yes, if there is one nearby. Just change the channel, and everything is in order. I awoke in the middle of the night of a child screaming. See here. This is the channel selector. Remember, they must be on the same channel. So you can sleep safely. I should have been clearer. I'm sorry. - It's all right. Helge! It's the telephone. I must go. If you have problems again, just come back again. Or if you just want to talk. It is also nice. I have lunch at twelve, so... What have you done! ? He's going home with us. He's my friend. Hello, my name is Anna. What is your name? We must talk to your parents. - They are not at home. Are you hungry? Should I make pancakes? 50 meters. There are approximately... Anders? You know you can not go out. Anders? Anders? Anders? Where have you been? Where is your friend? You've ruined it. - What? The drawing. - I can just erase it. You can not erase the blood. What are you talking about? This was not me. It must have been your friend. It is probably not! Anders! Anders, you can not go out! Anders! Anders... Anders? Anders, this is not funny! Anders! Anders! You can not do that. I did not mean... - Shh! Come! Quick! So, you saw a man taking out a plastic bag, and, you immediately thought that there was a corpse? You have a great imagination. You have it. You remind me a bit of my mom. She always imagined such things. Some terrible things. One time she called the police. Because a man asked for directions. Do you think I'm fantasizing? I think you are a good and a very sensitive person... who have had too little sleep lately. It's not often you meet people that want to talk to you. Mom used to take me here. Often. Before she became ill. She is in hospital now. By the way, I saw you here the other day. I thought to say hi. No, I have never been here before. It was strange. I'm sure it was you. - No, you must have been wrong. Then it must have been someone who were quite similar. It was so strange. I demonstrated a camera for a client. Then I took a picture. Then I saw you. What I thought was you. Have you experienced coming home and not knowing where you were? I... suddenly don't remember. I have followed Anders to school, it is several hours I do not remember. I think this is because you... The fact that you sleep a bit too little, pure and simple. I had that too. When mom got sick, I did not sleep. You go crazy. To simply walk around in a daze. I could not work. If you have any questions, or are worried about... I know we do not know each other so well. But if you want to talk... You are kind. You are really very kind. You probably won't remember that you were here. Look! It's nice. If you want, I could... I can print it out for you. So you have a proof of where you have been today. Look. Now you have a proof of whom you drank coffee with, anyway. Who is it? - No one. I see that there is someone. - It's just a friend. You have no friends, my dad said so. Mom has a friend too. - You have no friends! What are you doing? Anders, do not do it! Anders... Anders, open the door. How did you managed to find the key? Why don't you answer? Never lock the door. Promise me that. Do you promise? How can you hang up a picture of him? He is my father. Don't you remember what he has done? How can you? You... I'm sorry. Don't be nervous. It is difficult, but you will forget it. You have to. After that what he has done, we will never see him again. You are not telling the truth. - Yes, it's true. He doesn't know where we live or our name. - Yeah, right. Why do you say that? I'm not allowed to say it. - What are you talking about? Who said you are not allowed? - He said it. Who? Have you seen your dad? Where? - In school. He has been there twice. It is not true. He is in a meeting. Come again tomorrow. - I'll wait here until he comes. He's allowed to be absent from class so long? - He is here with me! He says that his dad has been here. He has a restraining order! Hi. Shall we talk a little bit? Was it just suddenly that he had been here? You were not arguing? Then he said it to look bad? He would not lie about it. - He has done it before. He said things that were not true. He was afraid. He could not distinguish a dream from reality. He, too? - What do you mean by that? We have also done some research about what you told us. There was much there that was not quite true? You said you were a teacher, but you have never been registered at any school. I wanted to be. There's a big difference at it. Can you discern the difference? I can. I know when it happens, if it is important or dangerous. We are very worried. Expect that the case comes up again, without any definite result. If we get more messages about problems, we can not rule out that Tommy must foster. Are you sad? I did not mean to be bad. What should I do to be good again? Can't we go somewhere, just us two? Yes, but we just have to stay here a little longer. Why? I have to wait until I'm not afraid. This time... I shall not let go. Where is he? Tell me where he is! Where... is he? Tell me... where he... Hello! I can take a break in about two minutes. Or will you buy anything? - I need something that can record sound. Music? Voice? - Voice. Say something here, so we can hear it. I do not know what to say. Hello, my name is Helge. I was wondering if you would join me for dinner. Only if you'd like it, of course. Let's see if it works? Hello, my name is Helge. I was wondering if you would join me for dinner. Only if you'd like, of course. Yes, it works. - I can not leave Anders alone. Do not take it off, you are cold. - It's hot. Are they on the beach? - I do not know. I'd also like to be at the beach. - No, not now. You promised! You said we would go on the beach when it was warmer. Can I swim? - It's too cold. Maybe this summer. Do not run! You can fall. - I'm eight! I do not fall. Anders! Where is the lake? - Right over here. Is it here? Yes, it is here... But... You said you would quit lying. You said it! I'll tell the teacher! Never say anything to the teacher! Then they'll take you away from me! I'm sorry, Anders! It was stupid. I'm sorry! Anders, wait! Anders, wait! Perhaps you forgot to lock? No, I did not. Wait here. Be quiet. Mom, what was it? I do not know. Hurry up! Be there! I've found no towel... Would you kill me? - How did you get in? We have keys to all apartments, we have to check how it goes. How are you, Anna? Are you a bit lonely? It can not be easy for a young woman to be alone. I am not alone. I've Anders. It was not what I thought. You do not know anyone. You need someone to be with. I know a few! I've got a friend. - No, you don't. Such as you, meet no one. You're too scared to do so. Therefore, you are always alone. Stop it! I tell it to Grete! Haven't you been told? She quited. Now it is me who decides if you get custody of Anders. I'll be back tonight. Unfortunately, I have just had a break. I just wanted to invite you to dinner. At seven in the evening? If it fits. So you'll meet Anders too. Sure it fits. I would really like that. Really... Here is our address. Thank you. What was that you could not? I tried, I just could not... - Set the ISO first, then set it on Auto. Take a picture, now! Take a picture, now! It's just a matter of time. She'll never breathe again unaided. Think about it, Helge. Hi. - Hi. These are for you. - Thank you. Come in. And this here is for Anders. - So nice! He went to bed. He did not felt good. Is it serious? - No, he was just tired. He plays with a friend during recess. - How sweet. It's nice to have a friend. He has never had a friend before. He has certainly benefited from. - I do not know. Are you hungry? - Oh, yes! It was good! No, it was not. Excuse me. It's strange to be here. I grew up in this block. I've never told you? - No. The second entrance. We had to move when my mother became too ill to go up the stairs. You and my mom are a bit similar. She was also afraid that something would happen. I was not allowed to go out alone when I was little. What she was afraid of most? Everything. I mean everything! That I would be cold or run over... Enter a foreign car. Slip on the ice. Hitting! Hitting, she was madly passionate about it. It was the worst a child could experience. She smoked 20 Pall Mall without the filter every day. But did she wanted to vent? No, no. It is one of the first things I remember. I sat in the back seat. Mom and dad sat in front. They smoked like crazy. But for God's sake, do not open the window. It was madness. Your father. What happened to him? He died. When I was quite young. But I see him occasionally. Speaking a bit with him. See? I have a bit of imagination, too. What is the first thing that you remember? I can hardly remember anything from childhood. One thing I remember is... I'm with a woman. We are on a lake. We swim. She lifts me up. She embraces me. She is very happy. - Mom? I don't know. I envy you on the poor memory. I remember everything. And it's not always a fun. But how do you know that what you remember, is right? I have never thought of that. I see things that I know are not true. It happens every day. I don't know what to do. Have you talked to a doctor about it? - No! Then they'll take Anders from me. Anders' father is a lawyer. If I tell it to the doctor, then they'll take Anders. Do you hear anything? I hear a baby crying. It's not imagination, Anna. You've only received another baby monitor. I heard a boy screaming, "I will not!" Someone was unkind to him. Yes, or he wouldn't sleep. You were a bit tired. You started thinking too much. Look. It was not meant like that. If I had heard such noises, I would have been afraid. Should we listen to it now? - Yes. Do you think I imagine this? I almost hope so. Can you open? Say you babysit Anders. Say that I am not here. Who is it? - There is a man. Say that I'm not here. Hi. You are... You must be Anders? My name is Helge. Do you know who rang? It was me. You know what? I have a little present for you. I'm not allowed to get gifts from strangers. I understand. But I know your mother. So I'm not a real alien. - I must be obedient, otherwise mom will be angry. I think this is fine. Your mother is very kind. She does exactly the same, as your mother did. What do you mean? What do you know about my mom? - Such as we, know each other. Do not say anything. It will only be worse. He's gone? What did he say? You should not listen to him. What have you told him... about me? What do you mean? - What do you know about me, really? I have not talked to him about you. Where are you going? - I will talk to Anders. He sleeps. - I've just talked to him. You can not go in there. He is my son! No one enters there! Helge! Helge, do not go! Helge! Does it hurt? We have to help each other. We have to help each other. Do you need help? - No. Are you looking for Helge? He is in the hospital. Something about his mother. Shall I say you have been here? - No. Can I get a bit of privacy? No! Let go! Hi. Do you know why you're here? You were found in a parking lot, not being able to give any explanation. You must have had some sort of a seizure. Have you had it before? I feel better now. - Are you on medication? What kind of clothes I had? Nurse will lent you anything left behind. - I want my clothes. Your clothes were wet. They are there in the bag. What? Hi. - Hi. Where is Anders? - What has happened to you? Nothing. Have you seen Anders? - He is in the music room. I want to talk to you. - It is not proper now. I'll decide about that. I tried to reach you. We don't have your number. We have no telephone. What is it? The teacher saw that Anders had bruises on both arms. Looks like someone have held him tight. He has no idea how he got the marks. Do you know anything about it? He had none of them this morning. It must be one of the students. It has not happened at home? What do you mean? That I should have... I could never do anything bad to Anders. Ask him yourself! I'll get him. No, Anders is going to stay here, so that no one can get to him. The teacher will be here to watch him until we find a solution. He will be with me. That is my son. I know, but we are required to act so if we suspect neglection. Can I go? Sure you can. Eva can follow you out. I need the toilet. Surely it is not illegal? You are not allowed to go there! Stop! Anders? - You are not allowed to go in there! You can not take him with you! He must stay here. Come! My son is in danger! Someone has hurt him! Oh my God! What has happened? Who did this? Have you seen your daddy? Is he the one who did this? It must have been terribly hurting. It does not hurt. They are not mine. What are you talking about? Of course, they are yours. Anders? If I call this number, they'll investigate this? Thank you. A customer was here. Do you remember the one that struggled with a baby monitor? Is she here? - No. There is another customer having the same problem. What do you hear? - Hiss, and then there's a woman crying. Probably you've got the sound from another baby monitor. Does that mean that others can listen too? - It is possible. Just change the channel, and it will go away. The only one... I'm... thinking about is Anders. Without him I... do not... exist. When they... left him... in my arms, I thought: Run, Anna! Take him with you... and ran! It is... only you... that could... save him... But... I did... not. Next time... I will run. It... is... soon. Anna, you have to let me in. Anders's father is on his way here now. - What? Is he coming here? - Yes, to get Anders. He will be much better with him. Don't you think so too? If you don't open, I'll call up one that can break down the door. Where is he? He was tired after school. Can't you leave him to sleep some more? Ok. What is it? - Some wet clothes. Do not dry them there, the floor is destroyed. You can just sit there. What have you done to yourself? Did you fight? I slipped. You slipped and got wet? - I do not know. I thought I was under water. - You will not be wet from believeing it. No. You have no idea what you were doing? Right? It must be absolutely awful. It is quite possible we can look for each other after this? You need someone who can take care of you. Would you do it? - Of course I will. Anders can wake up. You do not need this anymore. Where are you going? - I'll just pick up the papers. He should be here now. There he is. Wake Anders and make him ready. Please... Dress Up! We are leaving now. Anna? Anna, what happens? Anders and I are packing. We are leaving now. Anna! Now we will be together. We will be together forever. As I promised you. Come on. - I will not. You don't have to be afraid. I promise. Anna! Anna? Where is Anders? Where is Anders? She lived there alone. Her son was killed two years ago. Ex-husband had abused them both. So he killed him and the boy. It is not true. I've been there. I have talked to the boy. Who was he? - Janitor. He must have been in, fixing something in the bathroom. Hello, my name is Helge. I was wondering if you would join me for dinner. Only if you'd like it, of course. Hello, my name is Helge. I was wondering if you would join me for dinner. Only if you'd like it, of course. Anders? Anders? You need to get someone to help you. No one can help me now. Ask my mom for help. She is not strong enough to look after us both. Show me your arm. Brant she gave you? - Yes. See here. It gets better when someone finds you. Then you can sleep. Once there was a small boy and a mom. They came to a whole new place. They had nothing, but each other. One day they went out in the woods which was close to where they lived. And where they went astray. But suddenly they saw something shining through the trees. When they got there, they saw that... there was a lake. Anna? Where is Anders? Where is Anders? Anna? Where is Anders? Here it is. You want some milk? Anders? Come. Anna? Hallo? Hey! Let me in, Anna. - Hi. - Hi. - Do you like the apartment? - Absolutely. - Haven't you been awake? - I slept badly, I just woke up. - You remember the importance of routines? - Yeah. He sleeps here. As the court has determined, he doesn't know where you live. - If you want a phone ... - I will not. If you want a phone, you gotta tell us. - He won't know the school Anders's going on. - He will not go to school. He is not ready. I taught him to read, we read at home. All children must attend school. As the situation is now, Anders may begin to live a completely normal life. He'll start school on Wednesday. He will also be there. He needs to be with other kids. You will sleep with me, right? Father held the boy's head under water ... ... marked by the traumatic incident he had... Goodbye, my dear. Hello! Excuse me... They've just moved the bus stop. It's right over there. Hi. Hi. Do you work here? Absolutely. - Was it okay with the bus stop? - Yes. I am a bit nervous today. My son has just started school. Don't apologize. I'm pretty worried myself. Is there anything I can help you with? Something you're looking for? - I saw that you had baby monitors. - Yes, we have in the department there. This is not my department, but ... - How old is your baby? - He's not a baby. He's eight. I am a worried mother. People think I'm hysterical, but I can not help it. - No, I understand. Just because you are so fond of him, right? Yes. This is on offer. A good model. Two channels, high-impact, belt clip ... I need to hear him when he's in the other room. This one can do that. Good... Thank you for your help. Look what I've bought. Is it our house? Draw the lake, so the teacher can see how well you live. - Where is it? - On the other side of the forest. - We can go there when it would be warmer. - Do you promise? Swear? Yes. Hello? Do you hear me? Anna to Anders, come in. Mom,whereareyou ? Hello? Anna to Anders, come in. - Cool! You bought a walkie-talkie? - No, just an baby monitor. - Mom! Mom! - You have to talk into this. - Can I try? - Yes, but be careful. Iamawalkie-talkie! Anders to mom, guess where I am now? Where can Anders be? I'mgone. GuesswhereIamnow. There you go.

Stop playing around Let's go Get out! Get out now! Where did you learn such a thing? How could you do that? How could you? You like comics so much you steal from my purse? Get out now Don't ever come back I'm sorry, mommy Please forgive me Mommy! - Hank, can I use your bathroom? - No. But I locked myself out of my house. No. Can I use your phone to call a locksmith? If I let you use the phone, you'll sneak in and use the toilet. Look, I'd prefer it if no one ever had to use the bathroom. But until that day, let's just make the best of it... and respect one another's privacy. From the lukewarm headwaters... of the mighty Brazos River... Stop it! Well, it is his cooler. Okay, I'm putting you in charge... of buying our prom tickets at lunch tomorrow. I have to break it to Kim and Dooley they're out of the limo. Are you listening, Bobby? - Yeah. - Come on. We can't cut through the high-school parking lot. We're middle-schoolers. They hate us. High-school students are far too busy with their studies... to care about us riding through their parking lot. Connie, come back! Oh! You are forcing me to protect you. Hey, Shorty. Where do you think you're going? We don't want any trouble, gentlemen. We're not letting you pass until you give us a little song. This is crazy. Just because we go to middle school... [Singing] If you want to be my lover, you gotta get with my friends Connie, go! - What? - Hey! Get him. I'm gonna beat the crap out of you. If you're not gonna help, be quiet. Oh, man! BOY: Dude, there he is. - Yup. - Yup. What the heck? You know, Hank, your selfish refusal... to let Bill use your bathroom got me thinking. I plan on creating and then cornering... the premium port-a-potty market. It'll be the best dollar a person could spend. Nobody's gonna want to pay good money to use... a stinky portable... washroom. Stinky? DALE: With the finest lotions, the softest tissues... and the most pleasing lighting design... the Port-a-Gribble will be a 4-by-5-by-8-foot slice of paradise. Finally a vacation I can afford. Not so fast. A dollar buys the key. That's the friend price. Thank you. BILL: Oh! I feel like I'm a millionaire construction worker. What the... Oh, man, look at him running around with that flabby little... BILL: What? What did I miss? Hank, we are getting his bike right now. If we move fast, maybe we can still find his pants. Peggy, if we get his bike now, we'll be getting it for him until he's 16. Then we'll be getting his truck. It's kind of a tradition for high-schoolers to pick on the young and the weak. No offense, Son. All right. I'll go get the bike. Just make sure you videotape my chef programs while I'm in the coma. Don't be a hero. Curl up in a ball and cry if you have to. Listen, if anything happens... promise me you'll take care of Connie. Make sure she goes to the prom. It's really important to her. Me and Connie at the prom? Wow! I won't let you down. Bobby? Tom Landry Middle School rules. TLMSR. Where's my bike? Yeah. So before I knew it, my entire bangs were on fire. Okay. But did he say whether or not he likes me? [School bell ringing] Yeah. Okay, let's go, freshman. That was the warning bell. Freshman? No. No, sir. I'm still in middle school. Look, I know it's tough in there for a freshman. They're animals. I got some advice for you. Puff out your chest and walk like this. I saw a gorilla do it on a nature show. Scared the crap out of me. Now, go on. ...and the uterine wall sloughs off... Taco Bueno in school? I thought that was just an urban legend. "Godspell"? That was banned in middle school. I have arrived. I am so wassup. Bobby! Thank God you're alive. I've never been more alive in my life. I was in high school. It was like I was living in a dream. But if it was all a dream... how did I get this burrito wrapper from Taco Bueno? BOBBY: That's right. Taco Bueno, in the food court, at the high school. Did they have a language lab? Did you notice what the teacher-student ratio was? Oh! My mind is just racing with questions. I gotta get back. The Colonel's cooking up something tasty for lunch... in the food court, at the high school. Hey, fresh meat, this is the senior bathroom. I'm gonna shove your head in the toilet. Put me down. My growth is stunted. My kidneys are broken. I'm really a senior. Like that kid on that old TV show? Yes, exactly like that kid on that old TV show. Now, put me down. You know, you do look kind of familiar. Didn't we see you at Conklin's party? Anybody who says they remember that party wasn't really there. - Oh, Dude. - Dude. Okay. So, what's the deal with all the "No Doubt" posters? Hey, wait. I thought you said you went to school here. I do. But I've been in dialysis the last couple of months. Lefty shut down and I just got him working again. Sucks for you. Well, anyway, we're in the middle of a big radio contest with... with, like, every high school in Texas. If we win, No Doubt's gonna play our prom. We're in fifth place behind a Catholic girls' school. Those chicks are tough. No Doubt rules. All we've got is some Vegas theme at our dance... at the hospital. So, what do you do? Eat weird stuff? Eat stuff, stack stuff, spray paint stuff. We listen to Pig 106 every morning. Wacky and Steve tell us what to do. [School bell ringing] Yeah! It's pep-rally time. Come on, kidney boy. Cool. Wow! Your cheerleaders really have boobies. Yeah. Even junior varsity has them. Okay, settle people. Settle. You're gonna want to hear this one. Conklin! Okay, I just got the word from Wacky and Steve... that Pierce High School lost their liability insurance... and can't do the Dishwasher of Doom. So, they're out. So that puts us in the top four with 296 points. There's no doubt we're gonna win this thing. God, I love this school. Yeah! Friends, I know you've used toilets. But I'll wager you've never truly experienced one. Why just relieve yourself when you can reward yourself? Mr. Strickland, is it? Well, I might be able to conjure up a little something. STRICKLAND: Hank, pay the toilet man. All right. All right, Anthony. The record's a minute. You ready? Dude... ANTHONY: Let me out. I can't breathe. I taste soap. Do we have anybody short? Where's that petite kid who tumbles? Rosemary? She moved to Oklahoma. I'll do it. What about your kidneys? They're full of Arlen High spirit. Who is he? He's so cute... and helpless. Kidney boy. We call him that because of his bad kidneys. You mean, like, he could die any minute? Try any second. BOBBY: Oh, yeah! Arlen High rules. I can't stop thinking about Connie. I know she's Bobby's girl. But I love her. They're not married. Go for it. BOBBY: I need the latest hard numbers in the No Doubt competition. An estimate does me no good. Pig 106 says Lubbock is getting a point a person... for cramming kids into a phone booth. A phone booth? - How are we ever gonna beat that? - Wait. I've got something that is the size of a phone booth. And smells like a phone booth. A port-a-potty. - That's rad. - Yeah. No Doubt is ours. CONNIE: Bobby? Please tell me you bought our prom tickets. I've got a situation here, Connie. Lubbock is cramming kids into a phone booth. I'll get the tickets tomorrow. Bobby, they're sold out. It turns out all those nerds who said they have girlfriends at other schools... weren't lying. Well, then come with me to the high-school prom. They're getting No Doubt to play. The high-school prom? Me at the high-school prom... hanging out with Arlen's best teachers. - Who's the middle-school cheese? - Oh, no. She's a high-school girl I know from the children's hospital. Yeah, she has... a little tail. It's not like a monkey... more like a hamster. They can't operate. So, they're dissolving it with Compound W. Oh, that brave little hamster girl. And you are so sweet to take care of her. I like the bow tie. Lose everything else. Check you out. That is one fly tux. Is that hamster girl? She's very sensitive. And she has super hearing. Oh. Because I was gonna tell you that Vivian wants to go to the prom with you. What are you staring at? Nothing. I was... Can you pick up things with your tail? Like that shoe? Yeah. Does it wag when you're happy? Connie, why don't we try this tux on in the dressing room? Bobby, why do those guys think I have a tail? Oh, probably because medical science... Oh! I told them you had one. Why were you making fun of me? No. It's very romantic. You have a tail. I have bad kidneys. We met on a rainy day at hospital camp. And now we can go to the high-school prom. I thought they liked you because you were so cool... not pitied you because you're a freak. No! I have the medical condition. You're the freak. You've gotta keep this straight or we're never gonna pull it off. I am not gonna pretend I have a medical problem. There are people who really have tails. Maybe. Well, I'm not going. Fine! But I'm going to the high-school prom. What's with hamster girl? Oh, she can't go to the prom. She's having that problem with her DNA or something. I don't know. It's bad. Hey, that means you can take Vivian. - Dude! - Dude! Let's go, kidney boy. Come on. Suck it in. I... thought maybe if you're not still creeped out by me... you might go to the prom with me. I've got two tickets. If you're not still, you know, creeped out. I'd be honored. Everybody settle down. Any minute now I'm expecting a phone call from Pig106. We're gonna find out... PRINCIPAL: Hello? WACKY: Yes. Hello. I'd like to order a pizza. Please, ma 'am. We're trying to keep the line clear. STEVE: Hey, you've been pranked by Wacky and Steve. WACKY: Hey, we have a lady here who'd like to speak to you. She's really hot. And I know I've spent more than a few nights thinking about her. Here she is. Steve's mom! STEVE: Dang, now I've been pranked. Let's just get to the get to. There's someone that wants to talk to you. GWEN: Hey, what's up? This is Gwen from No Doubt. TOM: Hey, this is Tom from No Doubt. ADRIAN: Hey, how're you doing? This is Tony from No Doubt. TONY: That's not Tony, that was Adrian. I'm Tony from No Doubt. GWEN: Sorry we can't talk. But we gotta call Lubbock... and tell them they lost to Arlen High. Congratulations, you guys. See you at the prom. You still in there, Peggy? What are you doing? LUANNE: Uncle Hank, is that you? I really need someone to talk to. Uncle Hank. Okay, Dale. You win. I need to use your port-a-room. So, now Mr. I'll-Only-Share-A-Toilet-With-My-Wife... wants to share one with us. Well, take a walk, toilet snob. Hold on, Bill. Here at Port-a-Gribble, we reserve the right... to refuse service to no one. No shirt, no shoes... yes service. Flowers. He's a squatter. [Ride With Me by Nelly playing] All right, what are we water-ballooning? - Cows? - Even better. Tonight's the middle-school prom. BOBBY: As high-schoolers, we should be doing something way cooler than this. Bowling's on me. We can steal shoes. KIM: Oh, thanks. Run, Dooley. - No! - You got soaked. Well, you're just jealous because it's Friday night and we have dates. Hey, hamster girl, what are you doing here? - She's... - In middle school. Middle school? Yeah. The Compound W dissolved the rest of my tail. They thought middle school would be less stressful after... you know, losing my tail and all. Okay. So, you're, like all normal now? Yes. I'm cured. Good. Because otherwise I'd feel bad about this. Get out of the way. If you want to hit a middle-schooler, you might as well hit me. What? This is my real school. I am a middle-schooler. He's so lame. Let's soak him. ANTHONY: Yeah, soak in it. Soak in your lies, kidney boy. Come on, Connie. Let's go inside. - Hold on, Joseph. - Oh, that's it. I can't take these mind games anymore. You're gonna have to choose right now. Is it him or me? What? Bobby is my boyfriend. You know that. I'm still your boyfriend? Really? Yes, but because you were such a jerk, I don't have prom tickets. So, I'm going with Joseph. Cool. Joseph understands that you only went to the prom with him... to get back at me, right? I don't really think he does. It's actually a bit of a mess. ANTHONY: Hey, kidney boy. - A prom ticket? - Yeah. We got to thinking that you did help us win. And No Doubt heard about the kidney boy. So, you had better be there. And you had better look sick. Oh, I'll be there. On one condition. [Don't Speak by No Doubt playing] Hey, aren't you kidney boy? No, sir. I'm not. Kidney boy is gone for good. Kidney boy died. He's gone. What's up, Arlen High? I just got some terrible news. This next song is dedicated to the memory of kidney boy. Poor kidney boy. PRINCIPAL: Conklin! Forget it, Daniel, it's gonna rain any minute. - Wait. All right then. I'll wait. "Of the house which isn't there. In the town which isn't there. It will be so sad." Luca? I've been in love with you for 1,480 days. That's more than 4 years. I'm so hot for you. Don't look at me. - Go on. Look at my face. Man, I'm in 7th heaven! 3 months ago, I'd have bet my right arm that this would never happen! Three months before... I'm Daniel. I'm 19. I just graduated from high school. I've never slept with a girl. Never licked one, never even touched one really. I don't know anything, apart from what Dennis told me. Soon the girls will be women, and then what will I be? Come on, get naked! - Come on, jump head first! Jump, you sissy! - What's taking you so long? You guys just shut up! Why did we bring this dork with us anyway? NO REGRETS. And then what? - Nothing much. She lies on top of me, I stick her hands in my back pockets and she moves up and down. Oh man, why? You'll never shoot off that way! - Sure I do! Right in your pants? That's disgusting! Shut the fuck up, stupid pastahead! You'll stick it anywhere! Is that it? - Get a grip! Oh man! Idiots! I don't care where! Just away from here. Imagine you get to a city where you know nothing and nobody. Everything's new: People, streets and all. You need milk? Fine, but where do you go? So you take off into a new world. In a new city you don't need milk, man, you need tangerines. Besides, I'd have to travel far to let a supermarket knock me off my feet. And besides, in every supermarket on earth you run into the same people. - No, not everywhere. Not like in Wuppertal. - And, you can do whatever you wanna do. At first, anyway. - Nobody knows you anyway. Well, I won't stay there forever! - That is what I like about you: You're slow, but then, some day... - Speaking of "some day", I need a community-service job. Any vacancies with your rescue service? I've been telling you. When I get home, I'll put on my uniform and practice the words: "What's happened here?" I'm telling you: Women love uniforms! It's unbelievable! Very soon now I'll say to some cute patient: "I will now stick this electrode on your chest. It could get a little cold." Yeah. School's really over now, right? - Yeah. To me, it means I won't see much of Luca anymore. Now, if you want to be precise, we should have turned right here. Really? Shit, no! Fuck, man! That's Dennis. It's pretty obvious that life with him is not an easy ride. I don't care. I only know life with him. If I could change anything it wouldn't be Dennis! Always remember two things: Tell every girl something new. Something you haven't told anyone. No matter how stupid it is. They'll notice you made it up especially for them and they'll love it! Luca isn't like that. - Save my friend, smile back at me. Do it for Italy. You see what I mean? Got a smoke? Hey Axel, I'll drive you home, if you tell me how to get there. If there is such a place. - I'm getting off here. My pleasure! Hey Axel, pull out your board and check the edges. Inconspicuously. Don't look to see if anyone's watching. Even if they all are. Right. Do that everywhere: In the desert, by the seaside. And especially here, where all the horny bitches are! Hey, old man, action! It's great you're back. It was boring. Maria! You look pale. Where's your sister? No idea. How was it? Did you see any sharks? See? - Are you walking? It's not far. See you. Man, that gets so... - Let's split, I'm dead beat. Bye Maria! Here's our world traveller. - Hello, Dad. Daniel returns home from his long trip. October 1st, evening. Hey, surfer! - Hey, chicken-shit! Have a seat. We're watching last fall's ducks. Some other time. There! Surprise! - Thanks. I've got a surprise for you, too. I called Brunger and got a wonderful community-service job for you. - What? At our church! - What? I thought, you'd be pleased. - No, that's not what you thought. Well look, Daniel, it'd be a great opportunity and we'd see each other on Saturdays. And your mother would be... - Don't start that again! What do you want? I took that job, too! It's already October now and you want to start university next year. Exactly, you idiot! You've only been back for 5 minutes. Give the job a try, you'll probably never want to leave. - Yes maybe, Dad. Fuck, nothing works out. Hello, this is Daniel. Yes, sorry, I dropped the phone. Could I speak to Luca, please? I often lie in bed and let time pass by. I lie down, imagine stuff, make myself believe things. This and that. Nothing special. But it's nice. The stuff about Luca by the campfire was a lie too. Here's what happened... I know everyone's got a piercing, but it's still nice. It's great. - We should all do what we want, whether others do it or not. - I agree. I pluck my eyebrows. - That's ok, too. To the ancient Romans, knit eyebrows were a sign of nobility, to the ancient Greeks it meant treacherousness. What do you wanna be? Roman or Greek? Luca, you're almost standing upright! - Women pee standing up, if they can. I'm not gonna ruin my knees! Most chicks do it like that! Every year... I take it back. Your panicing... I take it back... I just don't know, I really thought I wanted to go... Evening. - Good evening. - Your papers, please. - Sure. Shitty weather, right? - Are you a comedian, Mr Schneider? You tell me. - Did you have anything to drink? No. - Let's check your breath. Listen, I want to smell like a tropical fruit when I say goodbye to my girl. - The tires are worn. Listen, sport, we'll let you go, just so you won't be humiliated in front of her. But not because of the folk music trick. Thanks for warming my feet. Any time. Are you coming to my party tomorrow? I'm totally looking forward to it: Luca in America! Nice people everywhere, sunshine, palm trees, burgers, Miami Vice, beaches with palm trees, the ocean... Would you like to come up? Secondly: Don't be pushy. Let her know, you live your own life. Having no time makes you more interesting. It's difficult. - You don't have to. I've got things to do. - Wow! Two dates in one night! Not exactly. - Doesn't matter. When I'm a little tipsy I always do foolish things. And tomorrow's my driving test. See you tomorrow? Come on, son. Say something. 2 October. Daniel on his way to his civil-service job. Bye, Dad! Take care. Of course, you have to ring the bells. Believe me, to be a servant of God is something very profitable and rewarding. Also part of your job: Dusting and distributing the hymn books. Tomorrow is Thanksgiving, people'll want to sing. One book at every seat, please. That's what people want. We live in a strange world. People come to church to sing together, but if they don't have their own book, they bust each other's heads. Anyway, I'm glad you're doing it now. Did you know we have our own website? - Sure. I read it outside. An amusing idea, to get drunk the night before your driving test. It's cold! - That's your soul. Christ, the light of the world, what a reason for joy! But noah heard of God's plans and started to build a huge ship and stock it up with food. Too much? - A little. Then it's exactly right. - Good luck! Remember when you were little? You play with friends and everything's fine. You run into the street to get a ball or your brother or whatever you like. But suddenly you hear a squeal, but to you it sounds like a scream. The wind hits you in the face with an unknown force. And the car that almost killed you passes. Even though you're so little, you know your life has changed forever. That's what happened when I first saw Luca. I was 15 and I knew right away: My childhood is over. I saw her... and bang! Some things are pretty simple. I love you, Luca! - I think, he's throwing up outside! I love her. - I love you, too. Luca was one of those girls that boys from all classes were in love with. But in spite of that, as nice as only fat girls are. She does everything as if she's just invented it. No. - Yeah. I think it just happens. I don't know, I've never done it before. You must think I'm childish. Nonsense. Not at all. - Luca, you're talking too much again. You must totally love the first one. It's got to be absolutely wonderful. I want to marry the guy, I want music, a campfire... It's got to be beautiful, so that... - You like to remember it. - Exactly. - We're going for a swim! Wait! Pretty chilly, right? They're crazy! - Oh, Steffi! Cry baby! Sorry, Father, I quit. This job's simply too boring for me. Time and patience make the mulberry leaf turn to silk. Unlike this stupid music stand! I'd be a bad shepherd, if I'd let my sheep go at the first sign of revolt. We'll work it out! Please be so kind and put up the music stands, all right? Impossible, he's not gonna do that by himself? Yes, he is! He's far away. Rahn kicks it...! Are you crazy? That's it. I blew the only chance I had, twice in a row. Physically impossible, but I did. It's over. What a relief! Now you can finally find yourself a new one. Are you mad? - Man, all you do is whine! She leaves tomorrow. She'll be gone for 3 weeks. You screwed up anyway. Either leave her alone, or go up to her. What have you got to lose? Everything. Well, darlings? Sounds like home in here. Come on, let's get going. You first. - I am not invited, but I'm hungry. Come on, let's get going. Hello, Anja. Have you seen Luca? She was up there a minute ago. Let's hit the road. Fuck off! - I'm serious. Hey man, are you crazy? What do you think I'm doing here? - No idea. Very funny. You're getting me in a lousy situation, again! If I stay, she'll think it's because of her. If I leave, she's gone. Great! You're right, it was a stupid idea. - There you are! I'm sorry about this morning. I had no clue it would fly that far. - Don't worry about it. My dad'll fix it. I'll be gone. Yeah, right. Lothar. Get lost, will ya? You guys, you all think you're so cool, don't you? Hey, they're ruining your pool! I just wanted to say, I'd have liked to come with you yesterday. Well, too late. I'll get us something to drink first. - Sure. Shit. Oh, nice asses here, right? Fuck this... fuck this... I did sit down. Could you do me a favor, please? Depends. - I have to go, but I've got something very important to tell Luca. Before she leaves. Can you tell her I've got something important to say? Tell her to come to church before she leaves? - Sure. Oh and you can keep the panties, I've got another pair. So what are you? A swallower or a spitter? They're crazy, right? - Steffi, not now, please. Why do you always treat me like shit? - I'm sorry. Can you take me home? Well, that's my room. Nice. Why don't you take off your pants? - Ok. Where's the bathroom? - First door on the right. I believe in us, together as a band... We've definitely got potential. Many people who know the music business say so. They say we're as cool as a... Maria, I think I want to have a baby with you. Maybe later. You know, music is very important to me, but it's not everything. Go and check it out. No, nothing there. Maria, come here. You're freezing! Church is just very important... Total loneliness. Maria! Time and patience make the mulberry leaf turn to silk! Thus speaketh the Lord. LUCA, SAVE ME I quit. You want to know what our Saviour felt? Why doesn't she come? - I didn't get a chance to tell her. All right! - You Godless little runt! Jesus was an only child and a virgin. - I'll take over. Sorry, Dad. - No, I'm sorry. Dad, please! - I now know, I can't cope without your mother. Anna, please take care of him. Done. You're the only nice thing that happened to me today. Well, it is 10.45 already. Thank you. We're looking for a community-service help. There's our new guy! Come on. The only thing people hate more than being cleaned up by strangers is sitting around in their own crap all day. - Fair enough. Shoes off! - He's only kidding. I've brought you some fresh meat. The martyr! When I saw you, I knew right away you never served in the army! Another asshole. - What? When I saw you, I knew right away you'd never hear me when I whisper. This is just like Adolf in his final stage: He hired anyone! If someone asks you where you are you answer: In the way! Mrs. Grieger, Daniel will do the rest. Well, if that's necessary. Look, here. Down there. And now we turn her over. Hang on. Anna here. Ok, I'm right next door. Mrs. Grieger, I've got to go. But the young man'll do a good job. Besides, I'll be right back. Do it the way I told you to. If anything's the matter, have me paged. I'll be next door. Bye. Let's get started. - What? Let's get to it! In God's name! Son, what on earth are you doing? - Almost done. It looks pretty good. It does now! - It does now. You're doing fine so far. - Think so? Yeah, but there are 5 more to go. Axel! Axel? You bastard! I still can't believe it. - Me neither. It's like a ride on a red bike in here! Hello, Mrs. Grieger. - Hello, Daniel. Everything ok? I told you, you don't need them! You've got 5 minutes, ok? You're surprised. Right, and now get us some booze! I can't stand this misery any longer without a drop of scotch in my coffee. You ain't seen nothing yet! Attention! Eyes left! Look at those 2 pretty babes! Pretty thinly dressed for this weather. Where are we going now? Just for a ride. You'll get a new patient tomorrow. Her husband pulled her through the house by her ears. She tried to cut them off. What? Her ears? She needs lots of affection. That's why you're taking care of her. Tickets, please. - Just a second. You just keep going! Thank you. You're unbelievable! - Yeah, yeah, so are you. You have your life under control. As if it were easy. I mean, usually I get bored with women, or I'm sure I bore them. One of us always leaves. With you it's different. Or do I bore you? - Not right now. Funny. I was born and raised here and I haven't taken this thing in years. Because you are young and stupid. - No. Because it's something grannies do. I sometimes take this train all the way to Vohwinkel. What's with the girl you crucified yourself for? Do you bore her? - I don't know. I don't know anything about her. Do you have any idea how much it all depends on the weather? - What does? Getting the girl or not. You've got to meet her, say the right thing, the weather's got to be right, your haircut, too. It's like winning the lottery. - I won the lottery once. How much? - 60 marks. That's what I mean. It's not worth the trouble. Can you pee standing up? Go open the door! I'm from the social welfare office. I'm here to change the bandages. Stop crying! The doctor should come and see you. I'll tell my boss... - You'll do what? Am I talking to you? You don't talk to me like that. Not in my apartment! You shouldn't even be here, asshole! - The bathroom's over there. Dennis also lives here now. So the whole dump'll be worth shit soon. You look like a fag in that white gown. By the way, this is called the post-epileptic tongue-bite. Let go. - You say "Please." Let go. This is not the right place. - It wasn't the last time. You know what? Why don't you come to my place tomorrow after work? You really do know how to impress a woman, don't you? Hi, you two. Luca! - Don't worry, my parents also thought I'd never return. It's nice that you're back. Anna's my boss. Seems he was lucky, right? - Oh yes. Absolutely. You look different somehow. - You know: A new life, a new haircut. Well then, I'll see you. Hi kids, this is Daniel, please start now... Hi Daniel, this is Luca. Pity, you seem to be out, and I wanted to... - Wait! Here I am. - You've got a lot going on, right? No more than usual. - I don't want to keep you. I just thought we could meet some time. Before winter. Sure, why not? When? - How about tomorrow? Sure, why not? - See you tomorrow. - When? Tomorrow evening, maybe. I'll drop by. Ok, see you then. Is Dennis in? I live next door. - Hey, man! Still around? Want to play doctor too? - Careful, Big Mouth! Or I'll be out of here before you can say: "It was only..." I didn't want you because you're such a tough guy. - I don't give a shit. Kids, stop that. Dennis... Hi Daniel, this is Luca. Pity, you seem to be out, and I wanted to... - Do you understand these words, knight? She called me! With her own little finger she personally dialed my private number to ask me for an audition. And Anna wants to meet me, too. If one girl wants you, they all want you. You'll get yours, too, one day! Hi Daniel, this is Luca. Pity, you seem to be out, and I wanted to... If you want to impress a girl, remember two things: Be a cool guy and say cool things. And because all that is so exciting, let's smoke a big bong! - Not me. Hurry up! Put your lips firmly round the bottle. Press the bottle down. Now, simply open your mouth. Yes, it's got to hurt. Or else, it was wrong! It's got to hurt. Or else, it was wrong! See ya tomorrow. Oh well, it's not easy for any of us. All day, you're surrounded by scum. Always excuses: Nobody did it, nobody wanted it to happen, but who's to blame? The parents. The others. The icy west wind. So you're fucked up, are you? I'll tell you something, boy. The whole world is made up of wimps. Oh no. God, how I hate this. I can't tell you! Have you been sleeping behind the stove again? No, I was with Dennis. - When'll you come tonight? I'm off early, so maybe I'll cook something for us. I can't make it tonight. Are there any white gowns left? Just the dirty ones in the laundry. You don't look well at all today. Do you want the day off? No, it's not that bad. - I'm glad. And I'm off then. She called me yesterday. - Holy shit! So what? I'm going to meet her today. - Boy! Water makes you want to travel. Everybody wants to live by the water. They just don't know it. If they knew, I think all hell would break loose. Oh well, we've already got a river! By the way, what's the matter with Anna? Don't know. I think that's enough for now. Can you play a loud love song? - Is a pig's ass bacon? Forget Dennis. I know something too: If her breath smells better than the air around you, she's the one. So, take her! Let's go dancing tonight! What is it? - Oh fuck! I forgot something. I've got to go. I'll see you at the U-Club, right? Ok. Shit, no! Are you all right, Mrs. Grieger? - Yes. What am I doing here? Here I am. - I can see that. Have you been waiting? I'm too young to wait. Let's go in. Do you think you're alone in here? Acting like a total jerk? You're so gentle today! - Just happy! Where's Dennis? - Upstairs. She's getting cigarettes. - What a shame! Asshole! You've got a stain, there. You're the worst lying bitch I know! Great what you do: Kicking people in the butt. Does that feel good? - Oh man, wait! Forget it! You can go fuck yourself! - Tell me something new! What? - What? Do you think you're a big shot surprise? If I didn't already exist, you'd have to invent me! With Luca you can fool around, it won't mean a thing. Let her wait, she won't be alone for long. - No wonder, if you jump on any dick! How else can I find out if someone is different? Stand around and wait? Yes, exactly! I've waited 4 years for you! I've never got laid. Just because of you! It was your idea! - What do you mean? Are you insane? It was your idea: Love the first one totally and all that campfire crap! I was 14 then. Get lost, Luca. Wait! - Fuck off, asshole! You're the asshole! Cool down! You've been whining for years: Luca this, Luca that, Luca's so great! Don't you think I know that? But she's your personal property. Let me go, man, get lost! Hey, Eyetie! Who was it? Come on, let's go home. Quit sobbing, man! You go too far, Daniel. Drink that. Maybe you should let the girl go since she makes you so unhappy. Why can't you choose the one you love? Do you love me? Yes. Then sleep with me. I don't think that's a good idea. - Nobody wants to. Why don't you want to, if you love me? But I want to. Go, if you need to. I'd like to talk to Luca. - She isn't here, Daniel. Open the door and we'll see. - I won't. I'm going back to bed. Man, that's enough! Get lost, ok? - You know what? I've fucked too, Luca! It was nothing! Do you hear me? Luca, I can do it too, now! I swear! Got any scotch? - Only schnapps. Don't want that shit. You're too good for schnapps, are you? Let's have a look. Wonderful! I'll take it. Bastard! Come back, you piece of shit! - You can all go to hell! What are you creeping around for? I almost shot you, like a dog. My favorite brand of booze! Then I hit him in the face. I didn't know what else to do. Just like that. That's not very nice. Then what? Nothing else. I just split. Son, you are thinking too much. Or too little, but that boils down to the same thing. There's always a war with desirable women. You've got to fight, if you want or not! And the flipside of fighting is being a good loser. You lick your wounds and wait for the next woman. It's that simple. I didn't invent that and neither did you. Just do what you want to do! I swiped it. I swiped the whole bottle. Well, it's a start! Away with the evidence! Away with it! And that one, too. I'll clean you up tomorrow. And you too. Call the doctor, I'll start here. He's dead. - Here in Wuppertal, that's for the doctor to decide. Get out of the way. How are we doing? I'd say cardiac arrest following alcohol intoxication. Look at this place! We've been trying to revive him for 14 minutes. Leave it. Now it's your turn to get some practice. Would you like something to eat? - No, thank you, I'm already late. I baked the bread myself. - Why doesn't your son eat it? Sorry. - That's all right. I'll just put it in the fridge. Hello, Daniel. Have a seat. Nice of you to come. Have a seat. Sorry, too late again. I'm sorry, Anna. - What? About what? That you fucked me, not Luca? That you ran away afterwards? Or that I have to clean up this shit for you again? About everything. I've done that already. Let me help. - I don't need your help. I don't need you at all. Go and help someone else! See you soon, Mrs. Grieger. - Goodbye, Daniel. Oh shit! Yeah, this is Anna. 'M at Mrs. Grieger's, Daniel couldn't make it. Yes, he was here, too. Why are they looking for him? Wait! Take the day off. We'll have to figure out everything else later, ok? I think you can't choose, because it would be boring. "You won't come running now, you just avoid Reaching out for what seems too far off. Would you turn around now just 'cos someone said That somewhere else has the best view in the world? Where must you go so that your mind forgets, that it's been evening the whole day through? Maybe you'll still make it now, in the morning light. We cannot risk going back to the same moment again. For the time being, Our focus has to be operation troy. Dismissed. - [groans] - The double memories-- they have subsided? - Yeah. But I can still feel them in my mind. It hurts. - Your synaptic activity appears normal. You should be fine. - Well, I'm not, am I? You know, the other you told me to ask you About the cost of all this... Sacrifice. Every time I splinter, It feels like I'm being ripped apart from the inside. Eventually I'm not coming back, am I? - If you succeed, does it matter? - No. But if I don't? - James... You and I--we are breaking the unwritten rules Of the universe. But time... It's going to take what it's owed. Eventually... It will kill you. - How many jumps have I got left? - Not as many as I'd like. - Is it enough? - It has to be. Subtitles by DramaFever You're dead if you abandon me. I'm sorry. Wait. Gosh... What should I do? It's so hot. What do I do? I'm going crazy. Why today? - What is it? What? - Huh? Didn't you come out on purpose? To talk to me? No, no. Suddenly... heat... Well, actually... I did come out on purpose to talk to you. It's pretty cool out now that it's night. Should we go on the swings? Yeah. Nothing else happened? Huh? No, not yet. Ah. I'm okay with it... Since it seems like Chef and I have become closer. Anyways, what about you? Didn't you say you don't have much time left? You are worried about me now? What? Oh, I know, right? It's not my place to be concerned. Before... I just feared and hated seeing ghosts. I guess I changed a lot too. Honestly, talking candidly like this to someone... It's very rare for me. I was afraid of others knowing what I was going through. So, I would hide by myself... And shrink back. That's how I lived. Like a dummy. You're no longer alone. Even when I'm gone, Chef will be next to you. I'm not sure. Even if things turn out as we thought... will Chef continue to be next to me? Right now I'm feeling happy. But, at the same time I feel uneasy. Na Bong Sun, I'm sorry. Still, I like the present much better than the past. It feels like I'm getting along with people around me. And I don't see other ghosts. Just a little longer. Even if it's just for a few days... I'll stay next to Chef and then leave. Sorry for lying to you. This is nice. Going on the swings. It's been a while... [Oh My Ghostess Episode 11] This is embarrassing. Seriously. Gosh, this really is humiliating. Who was the one that was so desperate to get laid? Was I too abrupt? Was she caught off guard? Na Bong Sun! Oh, Che... chef. - Yes. - You... I mean... before... you can talk freely. - I'm just curious... - I was about to throw up. What? What... throw up? What I did... made you want to throw up? Oh, no, no, no. That's not what I meant. I think I may have eaten too fast. I felt a bit of indigestion. I suddenly had an upset stomach so... Oh, so that was it? Of course! If that's not it, what else could it be? I wouldn't have refused otherwise. Gosh, I was really shocked. I had millions of thoughts running through my head. 'Did I do something wrong? Do I smell? ' 'Did her illness come back? ' No, not at all. None of that is true. It's because I had an upset stomach. Then, it's all good. Let's go back up. - Let's go up. - Yeah. We should sleep now. It's late. Goodness that was a shock. Let's go on a proper trip next time. This will have to do for today. Yes, let's do that, Chef. Are you sure you're okay? Actually, you don't look so bad though. No, no. Aw. I'm still feeling sickly. But, it's gotten much better. After getting some air. I feel bad for some reason. Since you got sick after eating my food. No, no. It's not because of your food. It's because I gulped it down. Your food was really tasty. Really. - Perfect. - Well that's a given. Let's finish cleaning this up and go inside to sleep. Yes, Chef. That was awkward. Why did the timing have to be so... Well. Today isn't the only day. I'm really going to take her by surprise. Really. Na Bong Sun, you're in big trouble. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. I know, Chef. I know this is greedy of me. But, I will stay with you just for a short while. For a very short while. No more. Enough. Oh, you're here, Son-in-law! - You're home? - You're still awake, Mother. I can't sleep when you aren't home yet. That would be mean. You must have a lot of work these days? Yes, we didn't get enough new hires, so there's a lot of work. That's why your eyes look blurry, and you look really tired. Do you want a glass of wine? It's good for sleep. I'm sorry, Mother-in-law. I'll be your drinking buddy next time. You should go wash up now. You have work early tomorrow, right? Yeah. - Good night. - Okay. Good night to you too. When he smiles like that he seems like a kid. He looks so innocent. But, it's also not good to be too mild-mannered. It's a big problem. He's too nice. Why is that a problem? I married him because I liked that. That's a good thing. We have different taste in men. I find bad boys attractive. I'm not surprised. Who, exactly, are you, Na Bong Sun? Oh, oh, hurry, hurry. Sous Chef is hungry to death. Hurry. Hurry. Just wait please. Although it's just for us, it's a historic day since it's Bong's first time holding a pan. If you keep whining, it'll become dog food. How can this become dog food? It looks really good. Bong Bong, I think it'll be tasty. It's all done. - Get me a bowl please. - Okay. What's the big deal... - Let's see here. - It's all ready. I'll plate it for you, Sous Chef. Hold on. Wow, Bong Bong! You have a sense! - It's really good. - Really? How good could it be if an assistant cook made it? - It's hot. Be careful. - Hot, hot, hot. Considering how long you've been working as an assistant cook this is the least you should be able to do. It's edible. It's very good. Seasoned perfectly too. Wow, you're pretty good, Na Bong Sun. - What, what, what? - Oh, Chef. There was some leftover meat so Bong Bong made some bulgogi pasta. Try some. It's so good. Oh yeah? It is good. And the noodles are cooked al dente. Wow! I have to be out today because I'm doing an interview with some magazine. Min Soo, you're in charge of dinner. I'm sorry. I try not to be away for things like this. But, I know the editor there so... Yes, then don't worry about it. I'll take care of everything. During the interview, if you can talk about me a little bit... It'd be our family's honor. No, no. I really don't want to. - Na Bong Sun. - Yes. - You come with me. - Me? They want the assistant from the chef versus chef program. - Thanks everyone. - Yes, Chef. - I'll be back, everyone. - Bye, Bong. Hey, come on! Give that back! Chef, what do I have to do there? - It was a lie. - What? It would be too boring to go by myself. You can be my make-up assistant. Gosh, you totally fooled me. I was really scared because I thought I had to do an interview. Why would they interview you? You're still a long way off from that. But, that pasta you just made was pretty decent. You've improved a lot. I admit it. I was so surprised because it tasted so good. Starting tomorrow, why don't you put your skills to work in real life? Starting with the appetizers. I'll give you a chance. Appetizers? I'm totally in. That should be easy for me. Hey, hey, hey. Don't joke around now. Nothing is easy with food. Even when you're cutting a piece of bread it can taste different depending on how you cut it. Of course, of course. Humility again and again. Hey, don't you have anything else to wear? You should wear something else when we're heading out. This is your uniform. What are we doing here? Are you going to buy me clothes? Well, we're not here to window shop. You're too embarrassing to take anywhere. Oh, I'm happy. I'm so happy. Tada. - This is a no? - Yeah. Isn't this to die for? How is this? Okay. You like this? Are you happy? Yes! So very much! - Wear them well. - I will. Hurry up. Gosh. Wow, there's so many styles. - Hello. - Hello. Oh my goodness. There's so much here! Give me all these sale items here. What size would you like? Size... size? - Hey, where are you? - Yes? Oh, that person there. What's your size? It looked pretty good on the mannequin. This is not long or short. I'm not too sure about it. So why buy things without even trying it on? Forget that. We have no time. Trying things on? I hate shopping like that. Besides, it's much better than your Sun Restaurant t-shirt. - Let's go, Bong. - Okay. That looks good. Yes. Oh, Chef's so handsome. - Can you touch up your make-up? - Okay. You look very handsome. You look pretty. Should we try a different pose? Okay, this is the last question. You're a popular star chef with many female fans. What is your ideal type of woman, Chef Kang Sun Woo? Oh, my ideal type? Let's see... First, I'd like someone that I can cook with. And someone who knows how to respect elders. Also, someone who's small and cute. Someone who looks like a little puppy. It'd be good if they can be a bit provocative. As the popular saying goes... lose at day, win at night. - That kind of style. - Oh... I like eyes that are half-moon shaped. So, would that be someone like your assistant that came with you? I don't know... Aren't her eyes more weaselly? Yes... she's more the sexy type. There is something strange there. What! You got rejected? Yes, pretty much. Sun Woo says I'm nothing more than a friend. Oh my, he must be crazy. What could he find wrong in you? If I were him, I'd find it harder to see you as just a friend. Does he have some sort of issue or something? Right? He has really bad taste in women. So, there's no chance of that changing? Never. Professor, I'm grateful that you see me in such a favorable way. But, I don't want things to get any more awkward between Sun Woo and I. I just want to remain a good and comfortable friend. Where is he going to meet another woman as cool as you? Huh? Did Sun Woo mention anything else to you? Like another woman... Pardon? It's nothing. I'm just saying nonsense. Chef, you really aren't good at keeping secrets. What if the journalist noticed? How can you bring up half-moon eyes? It's so obvious that my eyes are half-moon shaped. It's up to me. She can notice if she wants to. Oh, okay. I'm sure it'll be fine. - Go on in. - Okay. Thanks for being my make-up assistant today. Yeah, you worked hard too Chef. Thank you for the new outfit. - Go on in. - Okay. Ah, I can't go in unless you let go of my hand. Oh... this hand. I was holding it. I have to let it go in order for you to go in, right? Oh, I'll let go. Go in. Ah... - Gosh, good night Chef. - Yeah, you too. Sleep well. That dress looks pretty. Oh, that's cold! What is it? What's wrong? What? What is it? Is this from the rain? The rain must've leaked through. What the heck! The floor is totally flooded. Gosh... The blanket is all wet too. What do I do? What should I do? I'll have to call someone to fix it. I should've had it fixed earlier. It's completely wet. There's no other choice. You'll have to sleep in my room tonight. What? Your room, Chef? What will you do then? Swim here and sleep? Do you have any clothes to wear? What? Oh, that's the best one. Kind of looks like a big bag on you. But, it's not so bad. Think of it as your pajamas. Chef... maybe I should just sleep in the hall downstairs. I think I might snore. How can I sleep knowing you're on that hard chair? You can sleep here. I'll just sleep on the floor... If you're expecting anything tonight, dream on. I'm really tired today. Who says I'm expecting anything from you, Chef? The mood in here is getting strange. Why are we suddenly sharing a room? I can't ascend yet. I want to stay with Chef longer. - Should we go to bed now? - I'd say so. - We do have work tomorrow. - Yes. Should we... turn this off? Turn this thing off... I better wash up. Sleep... let's sleep. Aren't you going to wash up? Yes, Chef. I don't usually wash up. Good night. Okay, good night. Are you... are you all right? Hold on a moment! Oh dear. Are you okay? Oh my! I think I'm okay. I'm sorry, Chef. It was dark. And something suddenly came at me and I was so startled. I'm so sorry. What can I do? What's up with you? Ah, really? Before, you were all over me so much to an absurd degree. Yes, I'm sure you find this absurd. I totally understand how you feel a hundred, no a thousand times. I've changed my mind. Remember what you said before? That you want to take things slowly. I thought about it and you were a hundred times correct. It's not right to skip steps when it comes to people's relationships, right? There's a process... you said. - Yeah, that's what I said that day. - Yes... - I said that before. That's what I meant. - Yes. - You just got it now? - Yes. It's just that the situation turned out this way. I thought you might have some expectations and I wanted to meet them. I'm not in a rush at all. I'm sorry for getting so startled. - So, that's what it was about? - Yes. Gosh, you really grew up Na Bong Sun. Goodness, that's what it was. Okay, go to bed. I was wondering what it was. Thank you, Chef. Go to bed then. - Yes, good night. - Okay. She was acting as if she'd kill me if we didn't do it right then and there. Now, she wants to take things slow? Is she playing me or what? Is this a push-pull thing? Huh? Gosh, I'm getting more annoyed the more I think about it. - Oh, hi. - Hello. Hello, good looking young man. What was your name again? - Jin? - No, it's Joon. That's right, Joon. Your face is the type that young people these days would like. - Like a Cocker Spaniel. - Excuse me? I'm not saying that you look like a dog. I'm saying that it's a shame, if only I were a few years younger. Mom, what are you doing here at this hour? Oh, I was in the neighborhood. Is Bong Sook here right now? Mom, I told you it's not Bong Sook. Her name is Bong Sun. Whatever the case... Hello there. It's been a while. If you have some time, can we talk for a moment? Pardon? Me? Oh, what can I help you with? - Here? - Oh? What is this, Mother? Mother? What do you mean, Mother? That's a bit strange for me to hear. - Just accept it. - Excuse me? I put a lot of effort into it, so you won't be dissatisfied. Chef's Mother, I think you must be mistaken about something. I'm not that kind of person. I can't accept this. - Just open it first. - What? Well, if you insist. You really shouldn't have. Oh my, what is this? He's an assistant professor in my department and he's 32 years old. He's a great catch, good personality, and smart. Both of his parents have passed away. If there's any small fault, it'd be that he has four sisters. But, what's the big deal? It's not like they are parents. What do you think? Do you want to meet him? - Me? - Yes. He's really smart and decent. I can guarantee that. Yes, but... Four sisters-in-law are better than a mother-in-law like me. I'm young and I've taken a lot of herbal medication. So, I won't be dying too easily. I'm really quite immature, as well. Can you handle an immature mother-in-law who will live a long time? - What... uh... - Mom, what are you doing? Chef! This is, well... Oh my. Just go inside. - Goodbye. - Come here, Mom. Bong Sun, Bong Sun. Contact me if you're interested. - I'll set it up right away. - Hurry up. Hey, that hurts! It hurts! Why are you doing these useless things? Don't come if you're going to do this. Listen to you talk. Why do you think I'm doing this? Bong Sook's horoscope is of a dead person's. She's going to have a short life, okay? It's Sun okay? Not Bong Sook, but Bong Sun. Sook or Sun doesn't matter. I'll take care of it. Goodbye, Professor. Gosh, seriously. Wow, that rude jerk. Do I have to find a younger guy for her? Where do I find someone better than my son? Hello. I'm the chef. What are you doing! Dong Chul, I'll do that. Take care of the potatoes for tonight's dinner side dish. Yes, Chef. Ji Woong better eat it. Yum. Is it tasty, Ji Woong? Chef, the garlic! It's burning! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry. I didn't see you there. You didn't even turn the oven off here. Oh my! You're burned? No. You are! Let me take a look. Oh dear, you do have a burn. It's from that bump with the Chef, right? What should we do? I'm fine. It'll be okay once I cool it down. Looks like it'll sting to me. You should've said something before, so that you could go to the hospital. It doesn't matter. It's no big deal. It's okay. Here, give it to me. Gosh... that looks like it hurts. Dong Chul, skim the foam off the top. Yes, Chef. What? - Put in more salt. - Yes, Chef. Yes, of course it hurts. Do you just endure things well or are you just foolish? I'm neither. I'm smart. Okay. Make sure you go to the hospital tomorrow. Don't suffer through the summer. I'll take care of it. Don't you dare tell the chef. He'll feel very bad. I think you must be a huge fan of Chef. Why do you like Chef so much? He has guts. He's different from the other chefs that just go abroad and study. You don't know this, do you? Chef backpacked around the world. And gained real-life experience by even eating food from out of the garbage. Chef even paid tuition and didn't attend. Isn't that pretty cool? Is it? Is that cool? Of course. By the way, is your friend doing well with her boyfriend? Friend? Who? That friend you told me about at the chicken place. Oh! Yeah, pretty well. But, now she's having issues because the guy wants to do it more. Yeah? That's amusing. Wait, wait. I'll put some more on this side here. - Gosh... - You'll get a scar if you don't. You can stop now. - Just this spot here. - You used half the tube. Gosh, just this little spot here. - Does it sting? - Ow, yeah. Do it gently, gently. I didn't expect someone who looked like you to whine so much. Ow! Hey! Ow... that's enough. Stop. Wait, just this part here. What are you two doing? I had something to talk about with Na Bong. Talk about what? Just some personal issues. - Personal issues? - Yes. - I'll head out first then. - Okay. Wait. Since when were you so close to him that you discuss personal issues? Maybe it was last week or last, last week? Yeah, I'll head out first. Hey, I'm not done talking... Man, I'm so flabbergasted! With me, she drew such a clear line yet... What is she doing, seriously? Who discusses personal issues by saying, 'Uh' like that? 'Uh'! Like that? Hey, you guys. Get a Popsicle from the freezer. It's been so hot all day. You have to eat one of these. I can't deal with this heat. Popsicle! Gosh, move really! - Looks good! - There's only one in here. - What? - What are you saying? I bought exactly the right amount. What is this? Sous Chef, that's your second one right? I don't remember. It is your second. You were eating watermelon before! What! What! A sous chef should be allowed to eat two. It's not like I had three or four. Why are you rubbing that all over me? I'm fine. You eat it. No, it's okay. I'm fine. I'm really fine. I don't really like cold things. - Hey, look at these two. - It's so yummy. What's up here? What's this romantic mood between the two of you? Suh Joon, did you change your concept to a romantic or what? Were you always like that or is it only to our Bong Sun? Now that you mention it, Joon and Bong make a good match. Do we really? Yeah, you two look great. You really do. Why you two, you two... Of all things, you're even dating now! Why you little... You get over here. I'll give you a knock on the head. Con–gratulations! - Congratulations! - Hey, hey! Aren't you getting ready for lunch? Chef, lunch isn't important right now. Congratulations is in order. It looks like there's a new couple here. What? Joon and Bong. JoonBong. Don't they look good together? Con-gra-tu-la-tions! Congratulations! Hey, hey! Is this a place for dating? Are you all here to play? Are you here to play? Aren't you going to clean the grease off the counter here? Did you do an inventory of the live seafood? You all have to receive a scolding in order to do your work? Get moving. Yes, Chef. You don't even get me an ice cream... No one gave him an ice cream? I guess not. Table three, one escargot, two specials. Table seven, one mixed salad, two Shreks. Table nine, one steak, two seafood noodle soups. Okay, got it. Dong Chul, you take the salads and help Min Soo. I'll take escargots. Ji Woong, noodles after you serve. Yes, Chef Joon, is this all the oil we have? Yes, I'll get some more. No, I'll get it. Do what you were doing. Chef. What? Come on. Why don't you look at me and talk? Hm? - Are you mad at me about something? - No. It doesn't look like a 'no'. Why? Huh? Is it maybe because of yesterday... that thing? Yes, I'm mad. Why? I am angry. What's with you? Since we're talking about this, what is wrong with you? Are you playing hard to get? No. Am I a fish that you're done reeling in? Seriously. You tell me you want to take things slow but you're having a grand ol' time with Joon. - What? - You want to start two-timing? Joon's not a bad catch. He's good-looking, and competent. Chef, you're not jealous now, are you? As if I'm jealous. Hey, I'm Kang Sun Woo. You're Na Bong Sun, and I'm Kang Sun Woo. Kang Sun Woo. I've been too nice. You think you can act however, huh? Chef, I think you seriously misunderstood the situation. What misunderstanding? Tell me. Well, but then... I can't say because I made a promise. A promise? Now you're blatantly... Forget it. I'm getting annoyed. I don't have time to argue, even this is a waste. Just end it if it's going to be like this. Why are you acting this way over nothing? - Get to work, Na Bong Sun, Assistant Cook. - Wait, wait. Chef, chef, chef. Oh my. Chef. What is this? Really? This is a new one. What's next? I mean what's with the jealousy? Huh? I can't exactly say anything since I promised Joon. I'm really at a loss here. Wow, she just walked away. Just walked away. Sous Chef, have a glass of water since it's so hot. Hey, hey! Who cleaned these clams? - I did. - Did you clean them with your feet? - Don't you see the sand? - Where? You don't see the sand between the shells here? No, I can't really see them. - Isn't this good enough? - Good enough? Why do you get to make that call? Huh? What if a guest loses a tooth while eating this with the sand? Will you pay for their implant? Seriously... Do you think I'm giving you a hard time for no reason? Nope. This is why you're an assistant. The most important thing during the summer is cleaning the ingredients. What have you learned to this date? Hey, we can't use these clams. Switch our dinner special to shrimp pasta. Min Soo, tell Na Bong to go buy 5 kg of shrimps. Chef says that you should go buy 5 kg of shrimps at the market. Yes, yes, I'm going. I heard it too. She says, 'Yes, yes, I heard it too'. They seem clean. Gosh, if he's pissed, he should just be pissed. Why is he picking on me? Anyways, regardless of their social status or personality, men are just childish. Although, there is some cuteness about it. Mister! Oh, yes, come in. No, no. You can stay on the call. I'm just dropping by for a bit. No, it's okay. It's not a call that can get connected. Pardon? My daughter who passed away. Oh... I sometimes try calling her when she comes to mind. It probably sounds crazy to you. But, I think one day she might just come out of nowhere and answer the call saying 'Dad, it's me.' I guess you haven't canceled your daughter's phone plan yet? I just couldn't. Although, the phone itself is missing. Her phone is missing? Was it, by chance, an accident? No. I wonder what was so difficult for her to want to die. She just... she just left this world on her own. You're saying it's suicide? Oh dear, what's wrong with me? I should get you some juice. Oh, I'm just out of juice. I'll go buy some now. Just wait here a bit. No Mister, that's okay. I want to get some for myself too. Sit here. I'll be right back. Suicide... me? Why in the world would I? [Flight Ticket - Incheon to Guam Island] Dad, what should we do next Sunday? It's your birthday. It's just a birthday. Is there anyone in the world without a birthday? Still, it's your 60th birthday. You should do something special. Won't you feel disappointed? Oh, don't worry about it. Don't think about wasting money on it. I suppose going out to eat would cost money. And inviting your friends over for a big feast would cost even more money. Everything costs money. I guess we'll just buy a cake and blow out the candle. I don't need that either, kid. We'll just make seaweed soup in the morning. Yes, this is Starlight Tour Company right? I'm calling to confirm the Guam vacation package that I booked. Yes, it's for three people. Shin Myung Ho, Shin Soon Ae, and Shin Kyung Mo. That's right. I secretly booked a vacation to Guam because it was his 60th birthday. But, I committed suicide a week earlier? You're here, Na Bong Sun? I'll be heading out now, Mister. Why? You should have some juice first. Something urgent came up. I'll drop by again, Mister. Okay, see you. What's with her? Why is she leaving as soon as I show up? Kyung Mo... In my opinion, I don't think you're it. Right? You don't think so either. Ah, she was really into me before. I'm sure it's because of that chef. He intercepted. Who? The owner of that restaurant? You think so? Can't you just tell by looking? Didn't you see the way he looked at her when he was here putting in that hose? It's him, for sure. I'm sure he won her over with money, that horrible jerk. Hello, this is Na Bong Sun. Yes, where are you right now? I had some questions to ask you. Here you go. Yes, thank you. Please speak. What was it you wanted to say? Yes, well... Here. What is this? You know who Shin Soon Ae is, don't you? Yes, she's from that small restaurant. Yes, the daughter that passed away. This is Shin Soon Ae's diary. Oh, but why do you have this Bong Sun? I knew her a long time ago. We attended cooking classes together. We were very close back then. But, I hadn't heard about her suicide. I didn't even know we were living in the same neighborhood. I recently found out that she was that restaurant owner's daughter and found this. Can you take a look at this? Over here. These are tickets to Guam dated in September. And if you look in this diary, it was her father's birthday in September. How can a person preparing for a family vacation commit suicide? Doesn't that seem off? Are you sure that it's suicide? Is there any chance that it was an accident or murder? No. From what I recall, she texted her last words to her father. The circumstances and the story pointed to suicide. It seemed certain that it was suicide. Oh... I see. Why would she have done it? I don't think she had a reason to do it. I'm not sure. With depression, it's not always easy for people to tell. I'll look through the files again. To see if there are any suspicious circumstances. Okay, thank you for doing me this favor. - I'll hold onto this. - Excuse me? To see if there's anything I should refer to. Ah, okay. Then, you do that. You never know, so can you look at this too? Sure. When did you get this burn? It looks pretty fresh. Is this from bumping into the chef earlier today? - Oh, it is! - That must've hurt a lot. I'm fine. I put on ointment. What do you mean? This is pretty bad. Our chef is always going on about how the kitchen is like a gunpowder storage room. He's always going on about how we should be careful of knives and fire. Instead of giving us a bonus, he gives us injuries? Gosh... Hey, Joon. Yes, Chef. - Is your back okay? - Pardon? Is your back okay? Yes, it's okay. It's not too bad. Let me see. Hey, it's pretty bad. If you got hurt, you should say so. Shouldn't you go to the hospital? No, I'll be fine with ointment. Anyways, I'm sorry. Do you have something else to say? You know in the storage room before... When you were with Bong Sun earlier, was she putting ointment on it for you? Ah, that's right. I told her not to tell you because I didn't want you to worry. Well, then... What's he smiling about? Gosh, why was I so petty? Chef, here's the shrimp. Why are you so late? Did you make the shrimp or something? Yes, some. She's pissed off. She's really pissed off. Why was I so rash? How do I resolve this? I'm going nuts. I just don't understand this. Why would I? - Na Bong Sun, I have to go somewhere. - Okay. - Where? - I need to find out something. I washed the plates and put them away. I'll be back. Wait! Organize the storage room when you have the time! Yes, Chef. It's so dirty. Dong Chul, do the vegetables ahead of time. Yes, Chef. - Peel the shrimps well. - Yes, Chef. We're going to make some bread. Check on the dough once more and get some rosemary. - Yes, Chef. - Hey, Min Soo... When you have time, you should tell the kids to do it. And clean up the fridge. It's a huge mess. Would you leave it like that if this was your home? No, Chef. Are you sure that it's suicide? Is there any chance that it was an accident or murder? Let's see, let's see. The husband is suspicious. Does he have another wife somewhere, maybe a third. Do you see something? I'm right, aren't I? He has another woman. Oh my, that was out of nowhere. She hasn't left, this wench. What is it? Who's this wench? What happened to you? What are you doing here? Us... us? I'm not talking to you, ladies. I need to speak to you. I have something to ask. Ask me later. I haven't had customers in ages. It's urgent. Excuse me. We'll just come back another time. - I've received your fortune. Ladies! - Please sit. You have great timing, don't you? Why are you still here, anyways? What happened to the overnight trip? That's not what's important right now. Apparently, I took my own life. What? You really did? But no matter how much I think about it, there's no way I'd do that. Unni, do people who commit suicide exist in this other realm? I don't think I've ever seen that. They do exist. There just aren't many of them. Even if they take their own lives they may have a deep grudge or unfinished business. Do you still not remember your own death? No. But, it's really strange. Why would I? Why would I do such a thing? I'm sure you had your reasons. Why don't you just think about ascending to heaven already? If you keep hanging around here and the three-year mark passes... you'll become that psycho, evil spirit that latches onto criminals. I know, I know. I'm going up. What do you know? I'm just more confused now. There's no class today. Clean up and come upstairs. Oh...why not? I was looking forward to class with Chef since it's been a while. I'm disappointed. - I forgive you, Na Bong Sun. - Chef. - I forgive you. - What? Honestly, I did get angry because of you. But, we developed affection for each other while arguing. And since you can't live without me, I will be the big person and forgive you. I really don't like flowers. It's not like you can eat them. Gosh, I'm doing these things because of you. Here you go. Okay. Since you've accepted them, I'll assume we're no longer fighting. Okay, next. I don't usually do these things either. I really don't like 'couple' anything. But, this one is mine. And for you... the kids might get surprised if they see. So, I got you a necklace. Here you go. There you go. It looks pretty. I have a good eye. Look at you being happy. You must be a girl, after all. Oh, Chef. How did I get this way? Seriously. You really are driving me crazy, Na Bong Sun. I don't know what's going on. Since I can't remember anything. I should hurry up and go see Chef so I feel better. - Na Bong Sun. - Yes, Chef. I'll never have a misunderstanding again. More so than I thought... I think I really do like you a lot. Me too, Chef. Hey, Bong Sun. Are you okay? What's wrong? I... just... What, what? I asked if you're okay? Yes, that... that is... No. Uh, it's just... Are you sure you're okay? Yes, my legs gave out. You shocked me. Let's get up. You just fell suddenly. I was so shocked. Let me see. Goodness. I must've gone crazy. I... What did I do? No, no, no... But, evil spirits are different. They're on a whole different dimension than ghosts like you who possess humans. They will never be able to die. They will latch onto shady people and go around committing evil acts. Na Bong Sun. Thank you for everything. I'm sorry that I'm leaving without even saying good-bye to you. But, I can no longer stay in your body. I'm afraid that my feelings will continue to grow and I would want to stay next to him. And I'm afraid that I may not be able to keep my promise to you. Even without me, things will work out between you and him. I sincerely want you to be happy. One last thing I want to say to you is that... You should do your best to love while you're still alive. Not just others, but yourself as well. She started liking Chef? Gosh, why did I have such a weird dream? Scary... What now? Why is that stalker barking so much? What's this? Hey, Bong. Where did she go? At this hour? What the heck? Oh no. What am I supposed to do now? Oh. Yes, Chef. Where are you? Where did you go after leaving your door open? Oh, I had something to do... nearby. You're seriously nuts. Do you know what time it is? Hey, you! Walking with your head down like that in the dark... What if you fall? What? Can you see me? Right. I can't take a step back from here. Chef is calling for me. Waiting for me because he's concerned. I've liked him so much all this time. And how hard was it to earn his heart? I'm only going to think about me. Just this once. I'm going to keep it. I'll do whatever it takes... To keep Chef's heart. - Chef! - Where were you... Chef. Why... why are you like this? Because of you, I lost all my sleep... Oh goodness. This is trouble. You've fallen for me so hard. Oh my. Well it is hard to fall out once you've fallen for me. Sort of like a swamp. I get it so you can let go of me now. No, I don't want to. I don't want to be apart from you. Well, what is this in the middle of the road? Are you manic again? Before, you wouldn't even let me touch you. Back and forth is your hobby. Subtitles by DramaFever You're mine now. You should value your body more. Yes, Chef. I will keep that in mind. See you later. I'll do it. A ritual for the dead. - I'm not ready yet and... - You have talent. Na Bong Sun, you can do it, right? - Clean it up. - Yes, Chef. And open that box up. I said stay seated. I'm dating her. The mood is a little strange today. I said I was okay. Why are you making a big deal? He's not the man I know. He's trying to kill Na Bong Sun. Subtitles by DramaFever - Na Bong Sun. - Yeah? I found out. '535-2368.' It was a car plate number, as we thought. Officer Choi's car. Really? I was trying to tell people through my diary and phone before I died. Go and tell Chef, Na Bong Sun. I'll go see you later. Okay. I didn't know you had that much interest in me, Officer Kang. What was that about my car? What are you so curious about? I'm not curious... Goodbye. You... Who, exactly, are you? You finally made an appearance... Shin Soon Ae. I remember... all of it. Why did you do that to me? Why me? Because you saw something you shouldn't have. Still, how... How could a person... It would've been best if you went up without harboring a grudge. Why are you being so bothersome? It's no use anymore. Your evil acts are being revealed to the world. You won't be able to get away with things anymore. I know you've become one with that body by now. Shut up! You're going pay for your crimes trapped in that body forever. I told you to shut your mouth! [OH MY GHOSTESS EPISODE 15] [3 YEARS AGO] This is a sobriety checkpoint. One deep breath and blow. I see you recognize me, Father. How could I forget the eyes that looked at my Myung Joon as if you wanted to kill him? I shouldn't have brought you home without knowing your true roots. You became a cop? Why? Can't I become a cop? I suppose there's no reason why you can't. Either way, let's not run into each other even by chance. Seeing you brings up the memories I'd rather forget and it's distressing. Wait a minute now. I heard Officer Choi is working the night shift today. Should I make him his favorite dish, stir fried bone chops? He'll get lots of strength from it! I'll start cooking now. Let's go on in. You got all wet. Oh, I'm fine. As long as you, my son, didn't get wet. Oh my, oh my. You know I got wet too. All right, Mom. No need to get jealous about that. Forget it, you two play together. Oh, seriously. Goodness... Oh, right. Should I buy ice cream for Myung Joon? Yes, yes. I shouldn't be standing here like this. Wait now... where should I go to buy the ice cream? Report it. Oh, my phone! This is 911, right? I'm at Yongsan-gu, Unyuh-ryu... in front of the Jangwol Mart. Someone has been hit by a car. Please come quickly! Hi, Officer Choi. This is Shin Soon Ae from the restaurant. Where are you? I have something urgent to tell you. Oh, Officer Choi. You must be on your way back from somewhere? Oh... Yes, I was. What's going on, Soon Ae? Actually, I just witnessed a hit-and-run accident. I called the ambulance and they took the person who was hit. I think I saw the license plate of the vehicle. I was going to report it to the police, but you came to mind. Ah, you did good Soon Ae. So, what was the license plate number? '2368.' I know for certain the last digits were 2368. Ah... 2368. What... what is it Soon Ae? I... I suddenly remembered something important... My dad is drinking with his friends... I told him I'd go pick him up. I think I should go now. I'm sorry. We're home now. Soon Ae! Soon Ae! No... Soon Ae! - Oh, Soon Ae! - Sis! Be careful. - Soon Ae! - Sis! Soon Ae! Sis! Soon Ae... I wasn't a virgin ghost. I had died so suddenly and couldn't go up. I was just a ghost with a deep, unresolved grudge. Why is it raining all of a sudden? That wench said she'd look into the license plate. Why haven't I heard from her since? I'm dying of curiosity for goodness sakes. Oh my! You rotten... How many times have I told you not to stand there like that? What is it? What's going on? Unni... Do you by chance... I remember. Why I died and how it happened... I remember it all now. Are you all right? Do you feel a bit more calm now? That's why you were roaming this world. You were killed off so suddenly by that bastard. It became a grudge. From this point on, you need to get your head on straight. Your foe is someone that is possessed by an evil spirit. Now that he has seen your face, he won't let things be, for sure. Shin Soon Ae, that annoying wench. Where did she disappear to? - Officer Choi. - Oh, hi Mister. What's all that? Should I carry some for you? Oh no. I just bought some pork hocks. The one from the market is quite good and they give you a lot. Oh. But, why did you buy so much? Can the two of you eat all of that? Of course, the two of us can't finish this. We have a guest at our place. - A guest? - Yes. I'm sure it'll be delicious. I was trying to tell people through my diary and phone before I died. Go and tell Chef, Na Bong Sun. [CHEF KANG] Yes, it's me. Chef, where are you? Where else? I'm at the restaurant. Did you hear from her? I'll go to the restaurant, Chef. No, I'll go there. It's dangerous this late at night. Stay there. Hi Mister, have you been out? I was a little hungry, so I bought pork hock to snack on. Ah... Where is Kyung Mo? Kyung Mo, come eat some pork hocks. Chef should be here by now. Chef? The customer's phone is turned off. You will be transferred to voicemail. Gosh, I told her not to turn off her phone. Maybe she couldn't charge her phone? Na Bong... Yes, hello. I'm Officer Choi's brother-in-law, Kang Sun Woo. Is he in the station right now? Spirit... The days are strange... Ridden by the evil spirits that commit crimes and make a mockery of humans. Entrust me with the power to punish the evil spirits. Sahbaltaeohmanibolsal. Sagalttaemamangdeurohgussal. Excuse me, is anyone home? Who is it? Hello? Who is it? - Hello. - What is it? Na Bong Sun has disappeared. As well as my brother-in-law. Na Bong Sun? Unni... Oh my! That evil spirit must have chosen her as his shield. What do you mean by evil spirit? This ghost has finally recovered her memories. She witnessed Officer Choi hitting your sister with the car. She was going to report it to the police, but was killed by Officer Choi. He has been possessed by an evil spirit. He's basically only wearing the mask of a human being. He's still not picking up? What's going on? He's never done this before. It's probably nothing, right? There was the incident with Officer Han and the station can't reach him either. I'm so worried. I'm sure it's nothing. He's not a one or two-year old child. He's probably meeting up with friends. Good husbands sometimes need to take a break and just relax. That would be a relief. I have a bad feeling. - Mom. - Yes? Can you get that trunk from behind that box? - Where? That one? - Yes. Eun Hee, what is all this stuff? Mom, can you hand me that wallet? - This? - Yes. And that cell phone. Whose phone is this? What's all this... - Oh my. - Hey, Eun Hee. Sun Woo, good thing you're here! What is all this stuff? I can't get a hold of Sung Jae and look at all this stuff... Oh, I ran into him a little while ago. He had to go to the rural area for a criminal complaint that came in. I meant to call you and I forgot. Really? Goodness! If that's what it was, why couldn't he give us a call? She was so worried. Then, what is all this stuff? Why does Sung Jae have these things in his bag? It's Officer Han's wallet and a phone belonging to someone I don't know. What is all this? Isn't this evidence from his cases? He must've had reason to investigate something on his own. We don't know so I'll ask him. Don't worry about it too much. Oh, evidence. Why would he leave this stuff at home? It's a bit creepy. He'll be home soon. Suspect Choi Sung Jae, Choi Sung Jae. His cell phone has been recently tracked to this location. We request urgent mobilization. Chef, please stand down. Stand here for now. This is Officer Choi's phone. He left it here on purpose and ran. Na Bong Sun... It's as if the customers knew Chef wasn't here today. It's so slow today. Yeah, even Eun Hee is sick and away today. What's going on here? Chef's away somewhere. You're right. Chef's not acting like himself lately. Yeah. Oh, oh... look at that. Just because the tiger's not home, the fox is pretending to be king. Is that guy crazy? Look at the way he's sitting there. Just because he knows them, he's hovering above them. What does he think he's doing? Is it his store? This here is a spinach Shrek pasta. It's one of our main dishes. I came up with the recipe, Senior. - Oh yeah? - Yes. What is it called? It's pronounced Shrek... Shrek. - Shrek? - Yes. Oh, it's good. Yes, it's good. Yeah, it's really good. But, my throat is feeling a little dry. Then I'll make sure to change that. Dong Chul! You know the Pommery that came in? Bring that and two champagne glasses. Quickly. Those guys work below me. With one word from me, they just pee their pants. Huh Min Soo, you're not that loser from Yong Jin High School anymore. You grew up a lot. Move it, move it, move it, move it! - Here's your champagne. - Thank you. Dong Chul, is your concept these days to be slow? You better move faster. Oh! Senior Dong Chul! Aren't you Senior Dong Chul from Yong Jin High Student Disciplinary Team? Oh, Jung Ki... Jung Ki! - Choi Jung Ki! - Yes, that's me. - You punk. - It's good to see you. Have you been well? - It's been so long. - Yes, it has. You're my senior. How can this Dong Chul punk be your senior? Why you little punk. You must be out of your mind. Hey, don't you know Senior Cho Dong Chul? He cleaned up Yong Jin High with his famous sidekick. Oh, why bring up the past? Sous Chef, you were my junior at Yong Jin High School? Hey, bow down. I said bow down, you punk. You can bow comfortably. Bow properly. Oh goodness... This is my girlfriend. Yes, very nice to meet you. She's very beautiful. We've been dating for two days. Where in the world did this evil spirit run off to? Let's see, let's see, let's see... See from the top and from the bottom. See it upside down, sideways, and from the right and left. Do you see something? Unni? I feel like I'm about to see something, but then I can't. Just keep trying nonetheless. Keep trying until you see. I thought you had powers. I thought finding people was your specialty. Why can't you find Na Bong Sun? I want to find her too. I've just lost a lot of my powers lately. Please try something. We need some sort of clue to find her. If something happens to her, I'll be so sorry to her and Chef. - Please. - I know that! You both keep looking at me with laser beam eyes. I can't see anything like this. Don't look at me, okay? - I really don't like it. - Okay, okay. Let's see, let's see, let's see again. Let's see again. Where is this now? I hear something. I hear... Oh! It's in the vicinity of Seoul. It's not far, it's not far! - Really? - Vicinity? There's a noise that's causing interference. It's... It's children. - Children? - Children? There are lots of them. Let's go! The kids are loving this. There are many people who are benefactors. But, there aren't many people who come in person and play with the kids. Ah, I see. It's nothing... I grew up here too. I heard that. I heard that you donated that car, as well. Ah... yes. So, how is the place we provided for you? It had been empty all this time. Yes, it's nice. I'm just staying during my time off. - Hello! - Hello. - Hello! - Hello! You were bored, weren't you Na Bong Sun? What is this? You're just filled with fear. I won't do anything to you too soon. That would be no fun. I did hear there was a fire here a few years ago. I have to get out of here somehow. Chef will be really worried. Where is this place anyhow? I think we were in the car for about an hour. I just can't figure it out. But... there's a familiar scent. What is it? When it comes to papillote, the quality and texture of the meat are important. What's more important than that is this rosemary here. Smell it. Oh... rosemary. Ah! Rosemary. That's right. This is rosemary. subtitles ripped by riri13 [HERB FARM] Why doesn't it make sense? Just search around kindergartens or schools where kids are. Why doesn't that make sense? Of course it doesn't. There are so many in the Seoul vicinity. It's not even a proper tip. You can't listen to a shaman. Even with a scientific investigation, it's difficult. You ought to know better. How about you cops? What are you guys doing? Shouldn't you trust anyone right now and just investigate? A person is missing and has been kidnapped. Look here, Kang Sun Woo. Don't you see us working eating ramen because we have no time to eat properly? We've been looking at all the CCTV's and looking at information all night. - If you would just focus... - Hey now! I know you're feeling frustrated, but this isn't the only case we have. We're having a hard time too. - Hey Officer Shin. - Yes. How many times have I told you to put fried kimchi in my bowl ramen? Huh? Well, I like this better. Would you guys do a scientific investigation if your sister was missing? You would try anything. Wait a bit longer Na Bong Sun. I'll come find you. - Hello. - Yes, hi. Have you seen this person around here? I'm not sure. I don't think so. Okay, I understand. By the way, are there any other schools in this area besides this one? [DAYCARE] No, you can't! Let me just take one look. No, you can't do this. Think about what you're doing. You're trying to open every massage room. What owner would like that? I'm just looking for someone. Let me take a look. What are you saying? If you keep this up, I'm calling the cops. Hey seriously! Get out, get out! Hey virgin ghost! Are you still down here? That's crazy. What are you planning to do? Are you all right? That's not important right now. I need help from you all right now. I need to find someone. She's in her late 20's. She's about my height, looks like a puppy, and has half-moon eyes. Her hair is shoulder-length and she's been taken by a man right now. She's somewhere near a lot of children so keep that in mind. I really need to find her. - Please, help me out. - Okay, I got it. She sure is bothersome. She was annoying when she was going around everywhere possessing everyone. I guess even dislike turns into fondness over time, so I can't ignore her request. This is like looking for a needle in a haystack. You think places with children are rare? Especially if you consider orphanages too. What's that place? What's this? Do you see me? What are you looking at? Spirit... this is all my fault. I neglected my duties. I gave into my feelings and committed a taboo. I apologize for that. Please, have mercy one last time. Give me the strength to dispose of this evil spirit. I make this request of you. Sahmanamtaebul. Saramnamiltabul. Sahmanamtaebul. Sahyongnameuntabul. Thank you, Spirit. Na Bong Sun, where are you? Where are you hiding, huh? Anyways, what about you? Didn't you say you don't have much time left? I should've been the one to get caught. I shouldn't have run. I'm sorry. Hey, you haven't found her right? No. I have to find her. She opened up her heart to me and even was concerned for me. If anything happens to her... You know for a ghost... You sure are quite human. The thing is, you've only given me one clue that it's a place with many children. That's all I have. I even went to all the orphanages. I couldn't even find anyone resembling that girl you possessed. I did end up getting very startled by a guy who could see ghosts. A guy who sees ghosts? His qi was extremely strong. He was really tall too. Why is it that everyone can see ghosts these days? Is it a trend? It's getting harder and harder to eat and get by. How is his qi strong? Even if I'm going to get rid of you... Here. Officer Choi... it's not too late to turn yourself in. For the sake of your family who thinks of you, Officer Choi... No, Eun Hee... - Think about Eun Hee. - Shut up! Who told you to talk? Do you know how much I hate people who talk a lot? Choi Sung Jae... Choi Sung Jae? Yes! We're trying to move the kids' dressers and so on. We're all women, so... Oh, of course. I'll help you out. Hey kid, I can see you. I'm not a bad person so don't be scared. Have you ever moved an object before? Can you try kicking that phone over there to me? Yes, that one. Hey! Who got water on my apron? It's you, it's you... isn't it? It's you, you, you! - It's not me. - You're dead! It's really not me! Where did you leave it? Where? He probably left it next to the sink. People should take care of their own aprons. I knew you'd say something. I knew you would. I knew it. Why are you doing that? Okay, just come over here. What's going on now? What's all this fuss about? Is there a problem out here? What is it? Gosh, it's hot. The kids were lacking discipline, so I was just... - What is it? - I'm going to go poo. - Poo? - Yes. Okay, you go ahead and do that. Wow, Dong Chul you really are the best. If we knew it'd be like this, you should've come out earlier. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You just can't tell what's going to happen in one's life. Chef! Hey, have you all been well? - Yes. - Sorry I haven't been around. Yes, this is Kang Sun Woo. Bong Sun? It's Na Bong Sun, right? Where are you right now? What is it? You can't talk right now? Is that it? Okay, then can you send a text? Hang up the phone and text me your location. Hurry. Rosemary. What is this? Rosemary... what is this? Is she saying quite horrible to disoblige you. I must no into the arena with the rest. My honor, you know. Honor? The honor of a tailor? Well, perhaps honor is too strong an expression. Still, you know, I couldn't allow the tailors to net a bad name through me. How much will you remember of all that when you smell the beast's breath... and see him opening his jaws to tear out your throat? I can't bear it! I'll sacrifice! I'll sac... Don of an apostate. Judas Iscariot! l-I'll repent afterwards. I fully mean to die in the arena. I'll die a martyr and no to heaven. But not this time. Not now. Not until my nerves are better. Besides, I'm too young. I want to have just one more good time. I'll sacrifice! I'll sacrifice! I'll sacrifice! I'll sacrifice! I'll sacrifice! Brother, I can't do that. Not even to oblige you. Don't ask me. Well, if you're determined to die, I can't help you. But I wouldn't be put off by a swine like that. Peace. Peace. Tempt him not. Get thee behind him, Satan. Why, for two pins, I'd take a turn in the arena myself today... and pay you out for daring to talk to me like that! Hmm. - No, no. Please. - Brother, you forget. Oh, my temper. My wicked temper. Oh, forgive me, brother. My heart was full of wrath. I should have been thinking of your dear precious soul. - Yah! - And I forgot it all. I thought of nothing but offering to fight you with... - with one hand tied behind me. Here's a nice business. Who let that Christian out of here and down to the dens... when we were changing the lion into the cane next the arena? No one let him. He let himself. Well, the lion's ate him. Poor wretch. He won't as much as look at another Christian for a week. Couldn't you have saved him, brother? Saved him? Saved him from a lion that I'd just not mad with hunger? Poor Spintho. A martyr in spite of himself. Shh! Attention, please. The emperor. Hail Caesar. Those about to die salute thee. Good morrow, friends. Everything is in readiness, Caesar. I'm looking forward to a great day. So be it. Blessings, Caesar, and forgiveness. There is no forgiveness for Christianity. Oh, I did not mean that, Caesar. I mean that we forgive you. An inconceivable liberty! Do you not know, woman, that the emperor can do no wrong and therefore cannot be forgiven? Well, I expect the emperor knows better. Anyhow, we forgive him. Metellus, you see now the disadvantage of too much severity. These people have no hope. Therefore there's nothing to restrain them from saying whatever they like to me. They're almost as impertinent as the gladiators. Hmm! Which is the sorcerer? - Me, Your Worship. - My Worship? Good. A new title. Well, what miracles can you perform? I can cure warts by rubbing them with my tailor's chalk. And I can live with my wife... without beating her. Is that all? You don't know my wife, Caesar, or you wouldn't say that. Ah, well, my friend, we shall no doubt contrive a happy release for you. Oh, thank you. And, uh, which is Ferrovius? I am he. They tell me you can fight. It is easy to fight. I can die, Caesar. - That is still easier, is it not? - Not to me, Caesar. Death comes hard to my flesh... and fighting comes very easily to my spirit... oh, sinner that I am. Metellus, I should like to have this man in the Praetorian Guard. Oh, I should not, Caesar. He looks a spoilsport. There are men in whose presence it is impossible to have any fun. Men who are a sort of walking conscience. He would make us all uncomfortable. For that very reason, perhaps, it might be as well to have him. An emperor can hardly have too many consciences. Listen, Ferrovius. You and your friends shall not be outnumbered in the arena today. You shall have arms, and there shall be but one gladiator to each Christian. If you come out of the arena alive... I will consider favorably any request of yours... and give you a place in the Praetorian Guard. Even if the request be that no questions be asked about your faith... I shall, perhaps, not refuse it. I will not fight. I will die. Better stand with the archangels... than with the Praetorian Guard. I cannot believe that the archangels... - whoever they may be... - would not prefer to be recruited from the Praetorian Guard. However, as you please. Come, let us see the show. The hour has come, Ferrovius. - Do you still scorn the Praetorian Guard? - I do. Then I shall no into my box and see you killed. Welcome, vestal virgins. Farewell. Farewell, brother... till we meet in the sweet by-and-by. You're going too. Take a sword here and pick out any armor you can find to fit you. No, really, I can't fight. I never could. I can't bring myself to dislike anyone enough. I'm to be thrown to the lions with the lady. Then net out of the way and hold your noise. You Christians have not to fight. Here. Arm yourselves! I'll die sword in hand... to show the people I could fight if it were my master's will... and that I could kill the man who kills me if I choose. Put on that armor! No armor. Here! Do as your told! Put on that armor! I said no armor. And what am I to say when I'm accused of sending you into the arena unprotected? Say your prayers, brother... and have no fear of the princes of this world. You obstinate fool. O Heaven, give me strength. That frightens you, does it? Man... there is no terror like the terror of that sound to me. When I hear a trumpet or a drum... or the clash of steel... or the hum of the catapult as the great stone flies... fire runs through my veins. I can feel my blood surge up hot behind my eyes. I must charge! I must strike! I must conquer! Caesar himself will not be safe in his imperial seat... if once the spirit nets loose in me. Oh, brothers, pray. Exhort me! Remind me that if I raise my sword... my honor falls... and my master... is crucified afresh. In with you. Into the arena! The stage is waiting! The emperor's waiting. What are you dreaming of, man? - Send your men in at once! - It's these Christians hanging back. - Liar. - March! - Shove them in there! - Touch them, dons, and we'll die here... and cheat the heathen of their spectacle. Brothers, the great moment has come. Farewell. I'm glad I don't have to fight. That would really be an awful martyrdom. I am lucky. Androcles, burn the incense. You'll be forgiven. Let my death atone for both of us. I feel as if I were killing you. Don't think of me, sister. Think of yourself. That will keep your heart up. Oh, it's you, handsome Captain. Have you come to see us die? I'm on duty with the emperor, Lavinia. Is it part of your duty to laugh at us? No, that's part of my private pleasure. Your friend here is a humorist. I laughed at his telling you to think of yourself and to keep up your heart. I say think of yourself and burn the incense. He is not a humorist. He was right. You ought to know that, Captain. You have been face-to-face with death. Not with certain death, Lavinia. Only death in battle which spares more men than death in bed. What you're facing is certain death. You have nothing left now but your faith in this craze of yours, this Christianity. Are your Christian fairy stories any truer than our stories about Jupiter and Diana? In which, I may tell you, I believe no more than the emperor does. Captain, all that seems nothing to me now. I'll not say that death is a terrible thing. But I will say it is so real a thing... that when it comes close... all the imaginary things... all the fairy stories, as you call them... fade into mere dreams beside the reality of death. I know now that I am not dying for stories or dreams. My faith has been oozing away minute by minute whilst I've been waiting here... with death coming nearer and nearer... with reality becoming realer and realer... with stories and dreams fading away... into nothing. Are you then going to die for nothing? Yes. That is the wonderful thing. It is since all the stories and dreams have none... I have now no doubt at all that I must die for something greater than dreams or stories. But for what? I don't know. If it were for anything small enough to know, it would be too small to die for. Perhaps, after all, I am going to die for God. Nothing else is real enough to die for. What is God? When we know that, Captain, we shall be nods ourselves. Lavinia, come down to earth. Burn the incense and marry me. Would you marry me if I hauled down the flan on the day of battle and burnt the incense? Sons take after their mothers, you know. Do you want your son to be a coward? By great Diana... I think I would strangle you if you nave in now. The hand of God is upon us, Captain. What nonsense it all is. What a monstrous thing it is that you should die for such nonsense... and that I should look on helplessly... when my whole soul cries out against it. Die then, if you must! But at least I can cut the emperor's throat, then my own when I see your blood! Lost! Lost... - Lost forever! I have betrayed my master. Cut off this hand. It has offended. Take this sword! Strike! - What have you done, Ferrovius? - I know not. There was blood behind my eyes, and... there's blood on my sword. What does that mean? What does it mean? It means that you're the greatest man in Rome! It means that you shall have a laurel wreath of gold! Superb fighter... I could almost yield you my throne. It's a record for my reign. I shall live in history. Once, in Domitian's time, a Gaul slew three men in the arena and gained his freedom. But when before has one single man... slain six armed men of the bravest and the best? The persecutions shall cease. - Ladies and gentlemen, you are all free. - Praise the Lord. If Christians can fight like this, I shall have none but Christians to fight for me. You there. Do you hear? You are ordered to become Christians at once. Pray, no into the front of the house and enjoy the spectacle... to which your brother has so splendidly contributed. Captain, oblige me by conducting them to the seats reserved for my friends. Caesar! I must have one Christian for the lion. The people have been promised it. They'll tear the decorations to bits if they're disappointed. Yes, true, true. We must have someone for the new lion. - Throw me to him. - No! No, my friend! You would tear him in pieces. We cannot afford to throw away lions as if they were mere slaves. Caesar. ...the captain. What? Throw a Roman captain to the lions? You must be out of your mind, Cato. I shall speak to you about this later. Your management of this whole affair has displeased me greatly. just see what a mess we're in because of your lack of good judgment. - Um... - - Caesar. No. This is really extremely awkward. Why not that little chap? He's not a Christian. He's a sorcerer. A very good idea. He'll do very well. Number 13. A Christian for the new lion. I'll no in his place, Caesar. No. I would never have another happy hour. No. On the faith of a Christian... and the honor of a tailor... I accept the lot that has fallen on me. If my wife turns up, give her my love. Tell her my wish was that she be happy with her next. Poor fellow. Farewell, brother. Caesar, go to your box and see how a tailor can die. Make way for number 13 there. Tommy! It's you! Good old friend. Oh, Tommy! It's an incredible... - An amazing thing has happened to me! I can no longer doubt the truth of Christianity. This Christian sor... - Now, I wonder why they all run away from us like that. Sorcerer, I command you to put that lion to death instantly. It is guilty of high treason. Your conduct is most dis... - - Don't be afraid of him. - I am not afraid of him! Keep between us. Never be afraid of animals, Your Worship. That's the great secret. For, you see, he's afraid of you. Come on now, Tommy. Speak nicely to the emperor. The great, good emperor... who has the power to have all our heads cut off... if we don't behave very, very respectfully to him. Come on, Tommy. Tommy! Stop! Come back, Tommy! Tommy, stop! You'll get us in trouble! Bad boy! Stop, Tommy! Tommy. Stop this instant! I'm so sorry, Your Worship. Tommy, now... - Tommy, stop! Back! Back! Don't let him no. We mustn't let him lash himself into a rage. You must show him that you are my particular friend... - if you will have the condescension. Look, Tommy, the nice emperor... is the best friend that Andy-wandy has in the whole world. He loves him like a brother. You little brute. You filthy little don of a tailor! I'll have you burnt alive for daring to touch the divine person of the emperor! Oh, don't talk like that, sir. He understands every word you say. All animals do. They take it from the tone of your voice. I think he's going to spring at Your Worship. If you wouldn't mind saying something affectionate. My, uh... - My dearest Mr. Androcles. My sweetest friend. My long lost brother. Come to my arm. Whoa! What an abominable smell of garlic! There. You see? Even a child can play with him now. See? Come. Pet him. I must, uh... - I must conquer these unkingly terrors. Don't no away from him though. Goochy, noochy, noochy, noochy. Goochy, noochy, noochy. Oh, sir. How few men would have the courage to do that. Yes, it, uh, takes a bit of nerve. Shall we call in the others and frighten them? Is he safe, do you think? Oh, quite safe now, sir. What ho there! All who are within hearing, return without fear. Caesar has tamed the lion. I have subdued the beast. It is strange that I, who fear no man... should fear a lion. Every man must fear something, Ferrovius. How about the Praetorian Guard now, Ferrovius? - I accept service in the Guard, Caesar. - Very wisely said. All really sensible men agree that the only prudent course... is to be neither bigoted in our attachment to the old... nor rash and impractical in keeping an open mind for the new... but to make the best of both dispensations. What do you say, Lavinia? Will you, too, be prudent? No. I shall still strive for the God who is love. For me, there can be no other. May I come and argue with you occasionally? Yes, handsome Captain, you may. Caesar, give us this sorcerer to be a slave in the menagerie. He has a way with the beasts. Not if they're in canes. They should not be kept in canes. They must all be let out. I give this sorcerer to be a slave... to the first man who lays hands on him. You see how magnanimous we Romans are, Androcles? We suffer you to go in peace. I thank you, Your Worship. I thank you all, ladies and gentlemen. Come, Tommy. Whilst we stand together... no cage for you... and no slavery for me. Come on, Tommy. Go on, Tommy. Kids... Mom! Mom! Kevin! Mom! Ruby's gone! Ruby? Agent Mulder's latest 302. Requesting assignment and travel expenses for the both of you. Sioux City, Iowa. That's the first I've heard of it. It came up through channels, from Mulder's ASAC to the District G-14, then my desk. I don't understand. In essence, Mulder is petitioning the Bureau to assign a case number to a tabloid headline. - He must have more evidence than... - Not according to his 302. I admit, that is strange. Even for Mulder. Perhaps it has something to do with this. Take a look. An X-File? Has he shared this with you? There's no need to protect him. He initiated the file himself. She was his sister. She disappeared 21 years ago. He was 12 and she was 8. He claims that he was in the room when it happened. He recalls a... bright light outside the window and a presence in the room. In your opinion, has Agent Mulder's personal agenda clouded his professional judgement? In my opinion, no. But you can see how it might appear that way? As you know, Mulder's preoccupation with fringe matters has been a source of friction in the Bureau. This is another case in point. I'm going to disallow the 302. With respect, sir, at least let me talk with him and make a recommendation. It just doesn't seem substantial enough to warrant an investigation. So we disagree. It's not the first time, it won't be the last. - lf we had a legitimate source... - This is the essence of science. Ask an impertinent question, you're on your way to a pertinent answer. What makes this case any more credible than the 100-year-old mother with the lizard baby? Because the lizard baby wasn't born anywhere near Lake Okobogee. Oko-what? Bogee. Okobogee. is that supposed to mean something to me? If you know anything about trout fishing. Or UFO hot spots. Define hot spot. Four sightings in 1967, August, including one by a National Weather Service plane. This is a light-blasted digitally-enhanced enlargement. The pilot took that? Try a Girl Scout with an lnstamatic. Four girls said they saw something. Five, including the Den Mother. The Air Force said it was a weather balloon. But no weather balloon was launched that day within 700 miles. Now read me the names of those Girl Scouts from 1967. Lisa Terrel, Bonnie Winston, Doreen McCallister, Darlene Mor... lt's the same Darlene Morris. Darlene Morris? I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Fox Mulder. We talked with you on the phone last night. Please come in. Well, I knew that if I screamed loud and long enough that someone would listen. But I never expected the fbi. This is Kevin. Kevin, say hi. Would you like some coffee? Some days I can't even get myself up out of bed. And Kevin has been acting so strange. I don't know what to do any more. I just want her back again. Ms Morris, during the divorce, was there a custody battle? Charles had nothing to do with this. How can you be so sure? Because I know what happened. It's just like it was before. - Summer of 1967? The Girl Scout troop? - How did you know about that? Your name's on record at the Center for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois. Really? A pilot made a similar sighting over the same area on the same day. They took her, didn't they? You... you said that, Kevin was there the night it happened? He didn't see anything. He was asleep. Can I talk to him anyway? Thanks. You know, I've told this story so many times now. Go to the newspapers and the police. And every time I tell it, people get this... look in their eye. Just like the look that you've got right now. Hey, buddy. Mind if I sit down? Thanks. Your mom tells me you've been having nightmares. I guess so. - You wanna tell me about 'em? - No. All right. What are you doing? You making something? Can I take a look at it? Thanks. It's coming from there. The TV? Maybe it's a binary sequence. Could be anything, could be nothing. I know you're busy. Look, I know a friend who knows a friend who can get you a ticket to a Redskins game. You got it! All right. You know where to find me? Thanks, Danny. So, as I was telling your partner, we found no evidence of kidnap. No phone call, no ransom note. - And since we have no body... - You assumed she ran away? It wouldn't be the first time Ruby ran away from home. How do you explain what her mother saw? I think Darlene has a very active imagination. I've heard those stories since first grade. So, basically, you ignored her statement. - l included it in my report. - But you didn't bother to check it out. We found nothing at the campsite. Let me tell you something. Darlene's little girl was no prom queen. I can't count the number of times I pulled her out of parked cars or found her puking her guts out. - lt was just a matter of time before... - Before what? Before something bad happened. lf Darlene makes up stories to get past that, fine. But don't tell me it's the truth. I'm not gonna waste my time. I just think it's a good idea not to antagonise local law enforcement. Who, me? I'm Mr Congeniality. We might need his help one of these days. I'll send him a Bundt cake. You're looking for Ruby, right? That's right. Who are you? Doesn't matter. Are you a friend of Ruby's? Ruby didn't have friends. She just had people she liked to hang with. And she liked to hang out with you? I guess we had some times. - Like the night she disappeared? - lt was Greg. She was supposed to see him that night. - Who's Greg? - Her boyfriend, Greg Randall. Supposed to meet up at the lake. They had stuff to talk about. What kind of stuff? Greg got Ruby pregnant. Whatever. She got herself pregnant. Do you know what they were planning to do about it? They were gonna leave town. At least that's what Ruby told me. You know Greg from school? Greg? School? I don't think so. All he ever did since we met him was pour beer. The Pennsylvania Pub. Excuse me! Do you know where we can find Greg Randall? Who's asking? What kind of trouble's he in now? We were hoping you could tell us. Greg called in sick three weeks ago. I haven't heard from him since. Any ideas where he might have gone? No, but if you find him, tell him he's fired. This is our hotel if you hear of anything. That's a nice tattoo. What is that? What's it look like? A flying saucer. You don't believe that stuff, do you? I take it you don't? No, I think it's just a bunch of crazy people howling at the moon. So, you haven't been out to Lake Okobogee, have you? No, I haven't. Why? You should ride with us some time. You might see some things that'd change your mind. Get a killer sunburn in the middle of the night. Where's Mulder? Where did you get the document? If you explain what you're talking about, maybe I can help. This is a document? It just looks like a bunch of ones and zeros to me. - Tell me where you got it. - Tell me what it is. Keep playing games and you'll be facing the D6. You can explain to them why you're obstructing justice. It's your call, Holtzman. But I'm not accountable to anybody outside my subcommittee. I don't care if it's the NSA or the Vatican police. It's a defence satellite transmission. You're kidding! A fragment, but highly classified. We need to know where it came from. Well, sure. I'll let you know as soon as I find out. You just bought yourself a one-way back to Washington. We got it. Great. What? You shouldn't have told 'em. They have no jurisdiction. Mulder, they're NSA. They think the boy's a threat to national security. How can an 8-year-old boy who can barely multiply be a threat to national security? People call me paranoid. How did Kevin obtain top-secret information? Where do you think he got it from? Watch your step, ma'am. It'll be OK, baby. Don't worry. - lt'll be OK. - Come with me, son. Mom! It'll be all right, baby. Watch your head, please. You guys do really delicate work. Let's get this to Cryptography. I think we got what we needed. Thank you. - What is it? - l'm not sure. - We scanned it through the mainframe. - And none of the information is actionable? Other than the satellite transmission, none of it is a national security risk. The boy's being released later. So it was just a random set of ones and zeros? There was nothing random about it. I don't understand. All information can be rendered digitally in a series of ones and zeros. When we downloaded the data, we found an amazing range of... Well, see for yourself. Da Vinci's Universal Man. A DNA double helix. There's lots more. That's the Brandenburg Concertos. But they're just fragments. Some lines from the Koran, a Shakespearean sonnet. Like someone's switching channels? - Mrs Morris? - l have nothing to say to you. Please, give me a minute to explain. Would you please just wait over there for mama? I'll be right there. - l thought you were supposed to help us. - This has been a terrible mistake. The government will pay for all repairs and damages. I don't want your money. I want my daughter back. And I want you to leave us alone. But your son has seen something. You stay away from me and you stay away from my child. Come on, honey. It's OK. Let's go now. I thought we were headed back into town. Where are we going? The boy is the key, Scully. I know it. - The key to what? - Finding Ruby. Just think about it for a minute. He's receiving digitised data from a television screen. Agent Atsumi said it was a statistical aberration. - l admit it's not much of an explanation... - l think that Kevin is a conduit of some kind. A conduit? A link... or a connection to whoever or whatever took Ruby that night. But how? If there was an abduction, it's likely that Kevin was touched in some way. Mulder, I know what you're thinking. I know why this is so important to you. I know! But there is no evidence indicating an abduction. That's why we're going to Lake Okobogee. According to the police photos, Ruby and Kevin were sleeping right here. Just a stone's throw from the forest wall. Meaning what? Meaning anybody could have come out of the forest to grab her. Have you noticed the tree line? Evidence of extreme heat. Or an electrical storm. Besides which, there's nothing to connect it to the night - of Ruby's disappearance. - That's true. Do you think lightning could have caused this? Do you have any idea at what temperature sand solidifies into glass? 2,500° Fahrenheit. Something was out here. Something hot enough to turn sand into glass. To singe those trees and to blister the roof of that camper. Mulder! Look! What is it? It's a grave. Shallow, by the smell of it. What are you doing? Mulder, you are disturbing a crime scene. Stop! What if it's her? I need to know. Are you OK, Mulder? Fine. Looks like a male Caucasian. Sir. Victim's name was Greg Randall. - Ruby's boyfriend. - Ruby had a lot of boyfriends. - Can I take a look at that? - Go right ahead. Look at that. It's her. The girl from the library. Who? We didn't get her name, but she claimed Greg and Ruby had run off together. Well, Doc Fowler's a buddy of mine. Delivered both my kids. I can find out who had that appointment. Have a seat, Tessa. We know that you lied to us the other day. We know that you had the appointment with Dr Fowler on August 7th. We know that you're pregnant, not Ruby. - Then you don't know nothing. - We can prove it, Tessa. And we can prove that Greg... was the father. So what if he was the father? This is very serious. Do you understand how serious this is? You've waived the right to an attorney. So if you lie to us here today, you could be charged with perjury. He promised me we'd be in LA by Christmas. He had a friend there. And I'd never seen the ocean. You said he and Ruby were seeing each other. You said they were planning to meet at the lake. ls that true? Lookit, I was nowhere near the lake that night, OK? Sure you were, Tessa. You knew they were meeting, so you sat and you waited for them. - You were angry and jealous. - l wasn't. You waited, and when they showed you killed him first, isn't that how it went? - No. - You snuck up and you shot him in the back. Bam! And then you killed Ruby. Bam! What was she doin' before she died? Was she pleading for her life? Was she running away? I didn't kill her! - Where's she buried? - l don't know! - You don't know where you buried her? - l didn't kill her! - You didn't? - She wasn't even there that night! Well, how would you know that, Tessa, if you weren't there yourself? You're not seeing the whole picture here. - Which is? - Which is that in all likelihood Ruby is dead. is that your conclusion or the Sioux City Sheriff's Department's? They're searching the National Park and a dive team is going to drag the lake. They're wasting their time. Do you really think Tessa is telling the truth? Why not? What if Ruby never did show up that night? She lied to us in the library and lied about her pregnancy. Why wouldn't she lie about killing Ruby? Because something was out there in those woods! We have a suspect in custody. We have a confession to one murder and a statement which speaks to the intent to commit another. It's over, Mulder. lt's time to turn this over to local law enforcement. I can't do that. - Mulder, where are you going? - To talk to the boy. - Darlene won't let you. - l've gotta see him. They don't want anything to do with us! Mulder, stop! Stop running after your sister. This won't bring her back. Come with me or don't, but until they find a body I'm not giving up on that girl. Hello? Mrs Morris? Kevin? Mulder? What does it mean? I don't know. I'm gonna check upstairs. Oh, my God! What is it? Just come up here. Look. It's her! It's Ruby. This is a long shot. They could be anywhere. You know, when I was a kid I had this ritual. I'd close my eyes before I walked into my room. Because I thought one day when I opened them my sister would be there. Just lying in bed... like nothing ever happened. I'm still walking into that room. Every day of my life. Scully! Darlene! Look, there's a trailhead. - Are you OK? - lt's here. I saw it. - Where's Kevin? - l couldn't keep up. Go ahead! Kevin! - Are you OK? - She's back! Kevin, I'm sorry, but... She's here. I know it! Kevin, I don't think she is. - l know you wanted it to be her. I did too. - Mulder! Come on! Scully? Ruby! She's unconscious but alive. I'll get help. She's been awake for almost an hour. Any ideas what caused the coma? No sign of head trauma, no narcotic traces or electrolyte abnormalities. But her white blood cell count was sky-high. Any attendant reduction in the lymphocyte population or release of glucocorticoids? Actually, both. How did you know that? They're symptoms of prolonged weightlessness. Shuttle astronauts have reported similar imbalances. Hi. Hi, Ruby. Who are you? We're with the FBl. I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and this is Fox Mulder. My mom said you might be coming by. How are you feeling? Fine, I guess. Where were you, Ruby? Can you tell us? It's OK, Ruby. He knows. I'm not supposed to tell. They told me not to say. Who told you? Ruby, who told you? Sweetheart, you don't have to say anything. You're right. We should wait till Ruby gets a little stronger. Can we speak outside for a moment? I think that it's best that we put all of this behind us. I mean, hasn't Ruby been through enough already? I know how disoriented she must seem right now. But in a couple of weeks, we... I don't want her talking to you. Or anyone. She should be encouraged to tell her story. It's important that you let her. Important to who? I have my daughter back. I don't want more trouble. Besides, she can't remember anything. But she will remember one day, even if it's only in dreams. When she does, she'll want to talk about it. She'll need to talk about it. Like I did? Listen to me. I have been ridiculed for speaking my mind. But it was the truth, Darlene. It's caused me nothing but heartache. I don't want the same thing for her. It doesn't have to be that way for Ruby. As far as I know, she spent the last month on the back of a Harley-Davidson. is that what you'll tell Kevin? I'm sorry. - Your eyes are open? - Yeah, but it's like - nothing's happening. - Try turning your head. I can't. - Why not? - l don't know. I can't move. So I don't. - l just lie there in bed. - Can you see your sister? No. But I can hear her. - What does she say? - She's calling out my name over and over again. She's crying out for help. But I can't help her. I can't move. - Are you scared? - l know I should be, but I'm not. - Do you know why? - Because of the voice. - The voice? - The voice in my head. - What's it telling you? - Not to be afraid. It's telling me that no harm will come to her. And that one day she'll return. Do you believe the voice? I want to believe. I want to believe. Visiontext subtitles by Susan Voas I made this! english THE CITY ON TRIAL Where ya goin'? Ciccio, look what I found! Whatcha doin'? Look down here! A hat. Jesus! What's that doin' there? Help! Help! They killed a man! Pasqualì! Don't leave me alone! Pasqualì! Pasqualì! # Oh, Marì! How much sleep I lose over you! # Let me sleep, # while hugging you. # Oh, Mari! Porter! Porter! What do you want? - Which floor is Ruotolo on? The floor below. - Come down! # Let me sleep.. The Ruotolo's, right or left? - Ruotolo? The right. - Thanks. - What happened? Come with me, the lady may need you. Why? What happened? The husband had an accident at Torre Annuziata. - But they're at home! They found him dead. He's dead? The door is ajar. I called twice but they don't open. Like they would sleep with the door open! Excuse me! May I come in? Donna Emilia! Donna Emilia! Donna Emilia! There's nobody here. Donna Emilia! The light's still on. Donna Emilia! Donna Emilia! Donna Emilia! Donna Emilia! Come on, go! Take everybody out, Ma'am! Mr. Ruotolo! Mr. Ruotolo! Mr. Ruotolo! The carriage is ready! On January 5th, you went with him to Torre Annunziata. To Pozzuoli, Sir. I brought him to Pozzuoli. Pozzuoli. Not Torre Annunziata. What time did you get to Pozzuoli. - Around 3. I was hungry, so.. - Where did you stop? He told me stop at the piazza. He got down, came back later and I took him.. To Torre Annunziata? - To Naples! Straight to his house. Sir, let's be serious. Pozzuoli is north, Torre Annunziata is south. My horse can go far, but let's be real. You're the only one who had keys to the place. What do you mean, Officer? I did errands for them because they had no servants. You think Don Gennaro would give the keys to me? Not even to his wife! - Why? Because she almost never went out. Even to mass, they went together. Was he jealous? - Well.. Did they fight? - Fight? We lived next door to each other for 15 years. I never heard them raise their voices. Did you visit them often? - No way! They never received anyone. Except on Thursdays. It was the day for the poor. How many poor were there on Thursdays? Who could count them? It was a constant up and down! Sir, with all due respect, but they even peed on the stairs. Sir, every Thursday, you'd see a new face. You know, the word spreads, and they'd come like flies. I never came for charity. I only asked for medicine. And you'd resell it, we know. - Me? Why did Ruotolo come to you on January 5th? On account of a bill. He was a seller of the finest products. All the provincial pharmacies bought from him. Sometimes he came to Torre Annunziata. How much did you pay him on January 5th? - 350 lire. Here's the bill. Signed in his own hand. Why did he leave this bag at your pharmacy? I don't know. He told me he'd be back. - You were the last who saw him! Sir, the last who saw him was the murderer. Bills sent to his residence. They're many. I don't understand why Ruotolo, in a good position.. It was she who had debts. Women, you know, have their whims. Is it possible that with the money she had she let the terms expire? - Why not? Sir, in a serious business like mine, perhaps too generous in the appraisal, sometimes the clients, instead of returning the money, prefer to lose the pawn. What can you do? That's all I need. Thank you and forgive the intrusion. - Anytime! Good to know. Should I resign because of this affair, I'll keep in mind your pawnshop. Always at your orders. - Thanks a lot. From all the strenuous investigations, nothing remained but a heap of papers, questions and answers. The account of all of these interrogations, ends up in the hands of the Judge Antonio Spicacci. He was usually assigned the most difficult cases that came to a hearing. Matters which required a man with great intuition and quick initiative. For these qualities, and for an uncommon experience of life he was preferred to his colleagues in the investigation of the Ruotolo case. Antonio, what are you doing? Still working? Sorry, Elena, I really couldn't. I have too much to do. - Why didn't you come? The usual promises of my husband. A shame! A great performance. - What can I do, Alfredo? I have to solve this case. Please sit, don't stand. - You want to start chatting now? What time is it? - You hear him! They want to leave and go to bed. Alfredo must tell me the latest. I stayed in the whole day! No, no, Elena. Not on the files, please. You don't need to add to the confusion. The kids make enough trouble already. What's this about the kids? Look. Just look! Am I not right? On the records of the trial. Yes, you can laugh. But these are sensitive things. They're kids! What do they know about sensitive things? Nothing. I'll have to lock up my study with a key from now on. If only you slept at nights, instead of always working. Why not tell him so, Alfredo? - Me? - Yes, exactly you. As a doctor, you should warn him. - What use would it be with him? He knows what he's doing. - But he hasn't slept for a week! You know I must finish this by the morning, Elena. Come, Giulia. Let's go see the kids. Careful, don't wake them up. Well? What has the popular imagination invented today? At the theatre tonight they claimed that Ruotolo killed his wife out of jealousy. And in turn he was killed by her lover when he tried to escape. In this city, all the crimes end up as crimes of passion. Moreover Mrs. Ruotolo wasn't an ugly woman, was she? And who would be the lover? Nobody. He escaped to America. It's not important as long as it's a love story. It's nicer that way. This time, the crime was committed not out of love or greed. According to you, what's the motive? For honor. Honor. And almost all these honor crimes end up being trials against the unknown. You see all these files? They belong to other cases that had no success, archived. I consulted them looking for some tie, a link with this case, because it exists, I'm sure. Only there's not a single proof. And justice can't fight against shadows. But this is obsession. Since you did that study on the Camorra, you see the Camorra everywhere. No surprise you see them here. I know you think I'm fixated, yet, I think this time, I'll arrive at the same place. The same conclusion: a trial against unknowns. You think with this formula, you can solve anything? No, I wouldn't presume so much. But you often told me in some cases you need to know when to settle for it. This time I have to, also because I don't know what else to do. But this time it's the others who won't settle for this! Read the papers. Look. EVEN THE LAST SUSPECTS SET FREE You have to to take into account how upset the public is. Yes, but we can't arrest people just to make the public or papers happy. I had to let them go because there wasn't any proof. There's no basis for an accusation. And yet, from the top they continue to insist, to put pressure. Yes, but justice is not omnipotent. They should put pressure on the police instead of us. We've got beans! What can we do? I agree totally, dear Judge. But you see, in giving this very sensitive case to you, we all shared the illusion, including myself, that you could do miracles, that you could produce with the little you had, a conclusive case. Thanks for the trust. But I believe, I couldn't do more than I've already done. Why not continue? Why close the case? Do this at least: don't close it. What hasn't happened today perhaps will happen tomorrow out of the blue. Keep on with it, keep searching. Believe me, it's necessary for justice, for all. Don't doubt that the police will also be stirred. Come on, Sergeant. Won't you help your countrymen? I'll send you a gift. - No gifts! Morning, Judge. - The commissioner in? - Yes, Sir, I'll let him know. Is he with anyone? - Two gentlemen. Commissioner, Judge Spicacci. Please, Judge, come in. - No, finish up. I can wait. Not at all! I was just coming to see you. Please. Don Luì, if you speak to the commissioner, I'm sure he'll say yes. When we're in America, we won't bother you anymore. - Let me see the papers. Well, they've released you this morning. When did they detain you? - January 5th, Sergeant. I've heard it from the chief! He called me on purpose. Too few arrests! Who can I arrest? My mother? Sergeant, the papers! You know very well, Judge, that I've tried my best. Has anybody claimed the inheritance? - There are no relatives, only an old uncle of his in Potenza. While she was from Bologna. Look at this: "No arrests in the case." Why do they interfere? Since there are no relatives, and nobody really cares, the newsmen feel obligated to cry. They feel part of the family. What is it? Nothing urgent, Sir. I only wanted to ask you if you could give a visa to this young man. He wants to emigrate with his wife. He's already petitioned for it. If not, he'll end up a thief. He already tried a few times but was always caught. How strange! Didn't you notice this? January 5th. Send him in. Maybe it's the wrong date, it's not possible. They would've noticed. All the police stations were informed. The Commissioner wants to see you. Sergeant, may the Virgin bless you. Will they give the visa now? You're surprised that the police forgot? Your name is Luigi Esposito. Yes, Sir. - Sit down. You'd like to emigrate, right? For a long time. I have a brother in Buenos Aires. I don't have a job and I'll wind up in trouble. - Exactly! I want to change my life, Sir. - Naturally. There's no time to lose. You must get away, and with the police's permission. I want to do it by the rules. - Good. Explain to me one thing. What were you doing in Torre Annunziata on January 5th? January 5th? - Yes. The day the police took you in. They took me in for climbing a wall in a villa trying to steal vegetables. I was freed yesterday, with a warning. Do you have witnesses? Who saw you? Who was with you? Sir, what witnesses? The police detained me. - Where were you? Who was with you? Answer. What were you doing there on the day and hour when Gennaro Ruotolo was killed? Me? There won't be any problems, he'll get it, right? Why don't you go home, Nunzia? It'll take a while. The Commissioner is questioning him. You're wasting your time here. I'm sorry. I'll wait for him outside. Can you tell Luigino? Have patience, Nunziatì. It doesn't matter, Don Luì. - I can't do anything now. Listen.. This door is never closed! Never! Get me all the records on this Esposito and tell the clerk not to leave. Him? But I've never seen him, I swear. I've never met him, you must believe me! You must admit it's a little strange that a person from Naples would go to steal vegetables in Torre Annunziata. It wouldn't be worth the cost of the train. You say you want to emigrate, right? You need our help. But look, If you told the truth and can prove it, I promise, we'll help you. - And you'd better! Or I'll put you in jail and you'll rot.. - You want to.. You want to jeopardize your future for.. for what? You're afraid to harm someone. Because you stole nothing. Sir, I'll tell the truth, I swear on the Madonna. But I can't give names. Let's hear the truth. Sir, I wasn't alone at Torre Annunziata, I was with a friend. We were going to rob that villa. But it came to nothing because he didn't show up and.. How did he not show up? You went together. We went together. But at the station, each went his own way. We were supposed to meet at the villa. I waited a long time. Then I thought I made a mistake and that we were supposed to meet in the garden. So I climbed the wall to see. The rest you know. - Bravo Esposito! You thought it all out, eh? You have a friend but you won't say who. You were together, then you weren't. Excuse me, your friend didn't meet up with you? You didn't commit the theft. And you spent two months in jail and he nothing at all only for an intended theft. And you're still afraid? Come on, how can you compromise yourself so? What do you fear from your friend? He's set much better off than you. He didn't even meet up with you. You see, Judge.. Sir, I.. Don't worry, Esposito. Listen. You want to emigrate, right? You want our help? Why don't you trust us? I believe you told the truth. Or you wouldn't have come here today to ask for permission. I saw you talking with the sergeant. Is the girl your wife? - Yes. Judge, you're too patient with those who don't deserve it. Sir, I don't want to harm anybody. I only want.. His name is Capezzuto. Capezzuto..? Armando. - Where is he? He was near the Concordia, but now I don't know. Sir, they'll let me go when it checks out? Of course. When it checks out. You'll allow us to check how many lies you told us? Don't be afraid. If you told the truth, there's nothing to fear. Again? Are you fond of coming here? I came to see Cifariello, the sergeant. He's long gone! - How is that possible? I haven't moved from here! - So what? You think this is the only way out? But my husband was with the commissioner! Ma'am, I'm very sorry. But your husband is no longer here. He's at the courthouse. THE LAW IS HARSH BUT IT IS THE LAW Come in. Go on, come in. What's your name? Armando Capezzuto, son of Alberto. Merchant. Of what? Above all... the middleman. The sergeant will have told you what we want to know. Our buddy has a feeble memory. But I'll refresh it for him. Come on, answer. Where were you on January 5th? Excuse me, Judge, but if you were asked what you did on January 5th, I bet you wouldn't remember either. - You'd better remember, believe me! Let's see, January 5th was Epiphany eve? Whom were you with? Usually, these holidays are spent with friends or family. You're right, Judge. Who ever thought of Epiphany? I was just with my family, as you said. At home with mommy. Too bad, the testimony of relatives don't count. No Sir, my family was away, I was only with my fiancée. She's not a relative and can testify. You see judge, my fiancèe was at my house the night of Epiphany. The eve and the day after. We never went out, not even from the room. I'm used to spending the holidays in bed, resting with good company. We got engaged in those days, if you want to know. I met Liliana on New Year's Eve. - That's great! So you didn't go to Torre Annunziata. Me? Torre Annunziata? To do what? Try to remember. Torre Annunziata, January 5th. Judge, if you asked me this right from the start, we'd be done by now. I think, the last time I was there was.. was 2 years ago. Yes, that's it. 2 years.. You were saying.. Armà! Tell it like it is, right? Tell it for both our sakes. We didn't steal, tell them! If they suspect the both of us, they'll implicate us in the Ruotolo case, get it? Hey, what do you want? What are you talking about? Who you wanna get into trouble? Don't you know him? I know him. He's from my neighborhood. But I never had anything to do with him. Take him away. - Armà! Armà, listen to me! One minute, let me speak! One minute, let me explain! Armà! Armà! Talk Armà! Tell the truth! Armà! Capezzuto, you'd do well to talk. - I said all I know. Oh, yeah? Let's change our method. We'll see if you'll talk. What's the girl's name? Liliana. Liliana Ferrara. You're in agreement, eh? Happen what will, you were together, in bed, everyday and at every moment. Where is this Liliana? At your house? In bed with you, even now! - Where does this fiancèe live? Send someone to my house. She drops by there every day. What did I say? At your house. She'll be memorizing her part. If she's not at my place, she's at her home. My mother can send for her. - Can we know where she lives? She's from a good family, I can't compromise her. - What's the address? She lives at.. a boarding house. Tortorella Boarding House, Via San Gaetano, at Spaccanapoli. Come on! Are you coming in? Girl, there's people! Evening, gentlemen. - Evening. Miss Liliana Ferrara, please. - Is she back? Wait here a moment, I call the mistress. Giudì, are those cards coming or not? - One moment. Miss Liliana, it's for you. Wait, girl! - I'll see to the mistress. I'll be back. - Alright. Come in. Good evening, darling. Good evening. Well? Are you in a bad mood? Sergeant! Sergeant! What's happening? - It's the police. You're my relative, got it? Have you seen it, Judge? Some boarding house! Gambling, rooms rented by the hours and there goes the boarders! See! I'll get it! I'll get it! What are you doing here? This is an honorable house! He was escaping down the stairs. Good, let's begin and nobody leaves! I wasn't escaping, Sergeant. Can we talk by ourselves? How long have you been engaged to Armando Capezzuto? You know he's being detained? - Armando? Why, what did he do? That's what we want to know. And you.. can help us. Did he tell you himself? I asked you how long you've been engaged. Not since yesterday, obviously. For a year? I don't remember. Didn't he tell you? What did you do on last January 5th, Epiphany Eve? Epiphany Eve? I was with Armando at his house, the day before and after. The day before and after, eh? We know that Capezzuto on the 5th wasn't in Naples. Not in Naples? Did he say he was? - Yes. At Torre Annunziata. - You mean Pozzuoli. Pozzuoli? - Of course, I was with him at Pozzuoli. No, you were in his house, you just said so. No, honestly I was confused before. We were in Pozzuoli, I swear it. For an outing. If you don't believe me, ask the mistress. She went too. Excuse me, Commissioner, but this is a bit excessive. A game among friends, and he writes "illegal gambling". Wouldn't you know, this boarder was feeling ill. So this gentleman who knows medicine peeked in her room to see how she was. And that one wrote "house for trysts". Maybe the peek was too long. Write! Write! Mastello'! Have you looked in every room? I want them all. Sir, this girl said she's ill. Another? We have the cure! Come on, no more fuss! Sir, I demand an explanation. This must be due to gossip. - Ma'am. What? - Come a moment with me. - Go ahead ma'am! Mastello', with me! Well, you see, Ma'am, I need some information. Is it true.. Please, sit. Is it true that on January 5th, Miss Ferrara spent the day out of Naples? - How should I know, Sir? When they leave, I don't follow them, I have a lot to do here. Yet you should know. The girl went to Pozzuoli with her fiancè, and it seems you went along. But she's crazy! Me? You deny it? - I do, I do. I know nothing about this story. Ah! Don Felippetti, they woke you up? It's nothing, don't be afraid. This gentleman has come to.. - Who are you? Don Felippetti is a poor man, he hasn't any family. He helps me out with the books, You know there's so much poverty. What are they doing? It was you in there, eh? Why didn't you open? Are you a client or an employee of the lady? I'm not an employee of the lady. - What, don't you help with the books? Yes, I do the books but for the owner. You aren't the owner? - I am! How am I not the owner? The house is called Tortorella and I'm Tortorella. Don Felippetti, are you a dotard or still asleep? Mrs. Tortorella, I don't know what you said to these gentlemen. For my part, I declare I'm not your employee, and if I'm here.. You! It was you, eh? I should've expected it. An anonymous letter, right Sir? Like teacher, like pupil. But I'll show you who Amalia Tortorella is! I'll teach you to send anonymous letters! - One moment. One moment, let me understand. The owner is not this lady? I don't know what anonymous letter you're talking about! For 2 months I've been saying that you may want trouble, but I don't. Here someone must speak, so I will. I was charged with doing the books by a third party, now deceased. But the boarding house is in her name. - For me, the owner is Mrs. Vecchioni. But this Vecchioni.. - Emilia Vecchioni? Mrs. Ruotolo. Emilia Ruotolo? - Yes. - Why didn't you report her right away? They prevented me all they could. I've been confined here for 2 months. They spied on me when I went out. They threatened me. She even manhandled me! Disgusting worm! That's what you are! Did you know the victim? The poor Mrs. Ruotolo? - What "Mrs."? What "victim"? Emilia, "La Bolognese". That's right! You knew of Mrs. Ruotolo, Lady Charity. Yeah, right! She lived the same life as me and worse. Tortorella, stick to the facts! - These are the facts. I retired before she did. This boarding house, I paid for penny by penny. I was the sole owner. But when the earthquake ruined the staircase, and the Minister of Health was going to declare it uninhabitable, I didn't have a cent. I went to her to get a loan, we made a mortgage. At maturity, she's suddenly my partner. And if the house is still open, she says, it's only because her husband has contacts in city hall. And they forced on me this leech who sucks me dry. - Me? Take my word for it: starving wages. I'm a credited accountant. I cashed in and cashed out. So you saw the Ruotolo often? No. I deposited money on their account, but I hardly saw them. When were you last time at their home? How I can remember? Long ago. Are you sure you didn't go on Epiphany Eve? Me? No, I swear! Besides that day I wasn't in Naples, I was in Pozzuoli. You denied that earlier. - Ah, no. Sorry, I was confused. You said January 5th. I wasn't thinking. The Epiphany Eve we were in Pozzuoli. Didn't Liliana tell you? For an outing. Moreover, you can ask the others too. Carmela, Maria, Adelina. We ate together at Totonno a Mare. - Tortorè, tell me, are all those girls still here? No, Adelina went away, she got a contract at a theater. Adelina? - Yes, Adelina Leonardi. And? - Wait, who else was there? Yes, a young man I know little, called Gennarino the Stubborn. A known repeat offender. - The others? Carmela? She left. She was a bad lot and I sent her away. - accepting that motion... - signify by raising your hand to say, "Aye." - [Crowd] Aye.! - Opposed? - [Crowd] No.! [Shirley] Theyjust couldn't support me... because, more than anything else... I was a woman. Running for the presidency. A woman. That got them. But Shirley, you have to stay in their faces. You see? You have to stay in their faces. You cannot then withdraw out of like, you know-- You're just drugged, or you're not gonna do it, or you think they oppose you-- We know what the story is, but you have to stay in their faces... because, by being in their faces, you're also in the people's faces. You see? And nobody can state your case as clearly as you can. What made Shirley Chisholm frightening to you? Her "woman-ness"? Her blackness? Her black "woman-ness"? Her progressive thoughts? Did she have the audacity to take the historical moment... that you were too slow to take? "You," meaning whoever's out there. You know? What was it? What was the problem? ####[Funk] [Giddings] In some ways, it's very exciting and romantic... this kind oflone, kind of,you know, woman... who's driven by a vision. But at the same time, a lot of people felt... that she was undermining social movements... that gained their power in some ways... by the perception of a unified front. Black women were not valued. Are not particularly valued. White men, highest value. Um, white women, black men-- black women. How do you not,you know, fall into that psychologically? How do you not accept the idea... that you are less than other people? There was a frustration that black women had... of being marginalized in the civil rights movement... as well as in a predominately white women's movement-- that they, sort of, had fallen between the cracks, so to say. And this was a period when women were finding their voices-- black women in unprecedented ways-- and they were in different arenas, you know, there was literature... and then there was the Shirley electoral politics. So there was a great deal- - There was another kind of individualism... and sense of liberation in this period. [Female Narrator] What about Pam? You can tell your mother, Harold. - What, Ma? - Her job. Is it working out? - Great, Mother,just great. - But can she still take care of you? She does fine, Mom. Really. [Tom Asher] Women were perceived as really nice. There had not yet been a recognition of equality in most professions. [Brownmiller] It was an age in which a married woman... couldn't have a department store credit card in her own name. She had to be Mrs. So-and-so, because there was the assumption that the husband... was paying the bills. The insurance on a car for an unmarried woman... was much higher than it was for any other category... because the insurance companies had the nerve to say... that any unmarried woman with a car... would be letting her boyfriends drive that car... so she would be an extra insurance risk. All these things were considered natural... until the explosion of the women's movement. But it was particularly unnatural... for a woman to have ambition. [Helen Reddy] ##I am woman, hear me roar ## ##In numbers too big to ignore ## ##And I know too much To go back and pretend ## ## Oh,yes, I am wise But it's wisdom born of pain ## ## Yes, I paid the price But look how much I gained ## ##If I have to I can do anything #### For over 15 years of my life... my brain power has been utilized... and yet, not when the professional politicians... but when the people say, "We want Shirley Chisholm to move out of congress," these same politicians whom I helped to keep put together... in order for them to be acceptable to the public... had the nerve to get together and say, "We don't want to put her in... because she is a woman, but we will represent the women--" We don't need anybody to represent us! - [Cheering] - We have people in this country that have the brain power... and the ability to move up. I'm going to run for a delegate for Shirley Chisholm. I ask all women in Manhattan... who would like to have a real voice to come to these open caucuses Monday night. [Woman] Much of the leadership in N.O. W. was supportive of Shirley Chisholm. Other leaders in the women's movement whojust had a different strategy. You go with a candidate who can possibly win... rather than using all that energy on someone, you know... cannot win, even if they're with you on all the issues. [Woman] There's been some confusion in another area... whether you will or you will not endorse Shirley Chisholm. No, that's no confusion at all. What I have said is very clear. Shirley Chisholm views her candidacy as a representation... of the right of a woman and a black to run for the highest office in this land. [Shirley] That movement was led by Bella Abzug. She used to say that I will support Shirley Chisholm. Shirley Chisholm is good. She's articulate. She knows-- But when the time came, she couldn't do it. She just could not do it. Out of all those women that were in our cohort... Gloria Steinem was the one that really kind ofheld on- - But she couldn't go all the way. She said, "Shirley Chisholm is good for the cause and everything. But, uh, I think George McGovern is great." I mean, that kind of double strategy, you know? Remember, again, this was Nixon. And this was the war. And these were really serious things, and people wanted to be, finally... you know, with someone who could win and who could change things. And the only reason why they didn't go with her is one simple reason. Maybe Shirley Chisholm won't say it, but I'll say it. She was a woman, but she was black. And they, themselves, didn't accept-- What can they say, that she was not a woman? So, why are you not with her? And from New York! And a liberal state! But she was black! The women didn't want me to discuss... what the black people were talking about. The black people didn't want any of the women's programs. It was that kind of- - And I was trying to bring everybody together. It was a hell of a position to be in. Really. I wonder how I got as far as I did... during the-- during the presidential campaign. One of the most active candidates of Campaign '72... is Shirley Chisholm of Brooklyn. She bristles at the suggestion she step aside... lest she draw liberal votes away from other Democratic presidential contenders. [Chisholm] Why is it, constantly quadrennially... when politicians come out from every corner to get... the most important thing you have--your vote-- why is it that it has to always be white males, white males... - white males, white males, white males? - [Cheering] So ladies and gentlemen, I conclude by saying... if you can't support me or you can't endorse me, get out of my way. You do your thing and let me do mine. - God bless you. - [Cheering] One of the reasons why Mrs. Chisholm is able to make it... in spite of all of the obstacles that she has against her-- so many things against-- I'm a woman, I'm a black... I'm "maverick-y," I won't behave myself... the bosses can't manipulate me, white politicians don't like me, black politicians don't like me. You know what why your sister is able to sustain all this? She has something that none of them can take from her-- brain power. - Yes, sir. - Plus, white people wouldn't think... that a woman, that a lady would be in office. That's not only white people. Black people too, son. There are a lot ofblack politicians that don't think a woman should run for president. See? Because a woman doesn't run for president in the United States of America. That's why I'm trying to break the barriers. You'd be the first woman who ever ran for president. I'm the first woman who ever ran seriously for president. They might have been running, but it wasn't a serious thing. It was a symbolic gesture. They didn't go out and try to get delegates and go up and down this country... and tell people, "Vote for me" or "Support me because I want to be president." They didn't do that. You see? I'm the first woman in this country running seriously... because I've been on the trail for the past seven months. Well, look, I wish had more time, 'cause you all are so much more fascinating... than a lot of these politicians, but I do have to go. Nice of you to drop by, and don't forget to study hard. - Good luck. - Thank you. I'm paving the way for you. Okay? So you don't disappoint me. You get your education. - It was nice of you to bring 'em by. - [Woman] Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Bye-bye, dear. - Thanks for your time. Oh, quite all right. Quite all right. Okay. Bye-bye. - Bye. - Bye. Roger, that's why I'm doing this. It's the only reason. Honest to God, with everything going against me. There are two words that I think have to be... in a sense blocked out, scratched out on the billboard... or the blackboard of the American scene. You take the word "hate" and the word "yesterday"... and draw an "X" through both of them, erase them, cancel them out... because both of them leave us with less than nothing. On the other side, or once you've erased those two words... or on the other side of the ledger, put over the word "love" and "tomorrow." [Man Announcing] Vote for Hubert Humphrey for president. We used to get, uh, little hate mail... with all kinds of, uh, things saying... "Who the bleep, bleep, bleep do you think you are that you can run for president?" She just couldn't believe that people, um, were that way. [Gottlieb] I arrive at an airport in North Carolina, and I'm traveling alone. I go to pick up my brochures and my bumper stickers. So inside these boxes were "Chisholm for President." There was one bumper sticker, I believe, on the outside of the boxes. And I go to that carousel that you go to pick up your luggage... and in this case, my boxes of bumper stickers... and when I went to pick it up, scrawled all over it was, "Nigger go home." Oh, I was-- I was attacked three times... during the course of my presidential campaign. Uh, one of them, I was very fortunate. He had a knife with a 10-inch blade. He was going to stab me in my back. That's why he was moving behind me constantly-- but he wanted to close to me to stab me, because he said, "I want to get her good. " And they took him in. But, uh, I had that happen to me. I don't like to talk about them. I really don't. I really don't. [Chattering, Indistinct] - [Gunshots] - [People Screaming] Good evening. Alabama governor George Wallace was shot... and critically wounded today at a campaign rally in Laurel, Maryland. [Robles] If George Wallace was singled out for an attempted assassination... I thank God that that never happened to her. But every day I used to worry in fear. That's why, I guess, I became so close. I would have given my life... to make sure that Shirley Chisholm would continue to be what she is. The political effect of today's shooting is hard to measure. The governor was favored in tomorrow's Maryland and Michigan primaries, and still is. Doubtless, there will be a large sympathy vote for Governor Wallace... in addition to the basic strength he already has. Roger Mudd, CBS News, Washington. In the meantime, the people on the welfare, sure... in turn, they are receiving money there for doing nothing. Yeah, but the way it works now,you're paying both for the guy on welfare... and you're paying for the fat cats at the top... that aren't paying their fair share of the tax load. What I am proposing is that we provide a guaranteedjob... for everybody that wants to work... and require that as a condition of welfare, the person be unable to work. [Man Announcing] McGovern. Democrat. For the people. Reporters covering you had been trying quite some time to get a price tag on your welfare bills. Can you tell us today how much it'll cost? There is no way, Mr. Schoumacher, that you can make an exact estimate. [Witcover] The candidates who are getting a lot of attention... continue to get a lot of attention... and the ones who don't get have a hard time getting any. A kind of a pecking order grows out of things that the candidates say... but also the very arbitrary judgment of reporters... of who's up and who's down. Oh, the media. Don't talk about the media. The media says, you know, "Shirley Chisholm is half crazy. "Oh, she's smart and everything, but she knows she can't be president. What is she taking up our time for?" and what have you. [Asher] Shirley Chisholm came to me... and it was all over a candidate debate... among Democratic candidates in California... and she had asked to be included... and, uh, was turned down. They wouldn't-- Every candidate-- Even candidates that I was beating in races across the country-- Because, don't forget, there were 13 of us. We ran into the court of appeals, filed an emergency appeal. It was like a mandatory injunction ordering the F.C.C.... to order the broadcasters to include her. Good evening. I'm Nat Hentoff, moderator of tonight's press panel... "Time for Shirley Chisholm." [Chisholm] They never dreamt that I was going to take the case all the way to court. They couldn't understand-- And I won. Oh, boy. [Chuckling] I won. [Man] From Los Angeles, Senator Hubert Humphrey, Democrat of Minnesota,. Senator George McGovern, Democrat of South Dakota,. and from New York City, Representative Shirley Chisholm, Democrat of New York. ABC News originally had invited Senator McGovern and Senator Humphrey... the two leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination... to appear on this program. Friday night, the Federal Appeals Court in Washington, D.C.... ruled that Mrs. Chisholm must also be invited to participate. If in fact the question does come down... to a choice between Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern... uh, whom would you support? I am not supporting any one man just on the basis of supporting a man. I am sick and tired of promises and rhetoric, and a lot of people are in this country. I think it is important to see what the team will be like. I will be very much interested in seeing who will be with Mr. Humphrey... and who will be with Mr. McGovern in terms of the team. The vice presidency of this country is becoming very, very important... and we just can't depend on thinking in terms of the top person on the ticket... without giving some consideration to the second person on the ticket. So I am not gonna make unilateral decision just on that basis. If your own candidacy for the top spot should fail... would you actively seek to be on the ticket? Are you now saying that you think you could serve... as vice president of the United States, strengthening the ticket. I can serve as the president of this country, believe it or not. - I phrased my question badly. Let me try it again. - That's why I'm running. I didn't have many signs that indicated I was doing the right thing. Really. I really didn't have-- People were looking at me askance. American history is filled with people who are Don Quixotes... when it comes to presidential politics... and they run. They run whether or not they have a chance. The idea that people are fearless and that's why they're taking action-- I think it's more like-- it's more important to recognize... that they're terrified and they're still taking action. That they know exactly what they're risking, and they still risk it. And if nothing else, I'm finding all over America... that people are sick and tired of the tweedledee-dees and the tweedledee-dums... who constantly flip-flap from one side to another. People are interested in having candidates that are truthful... candidates that have, if you will... just a tiny bit of morality and a tiny bit of integrity... and people that they believe they can go to sleep at night and know... that they are not selling them out or selling out the communities in which they live. The black vote will play a large part... in the Democratic presidential primary in California next Tuesday. Catherine Mackin has a report on how the two men... plus a third candidate, Representative Shirley Chisholm... are going after those black votes. [Mackin] Hubert Humphrey's message to black people in California is a direct one. Ladies and gentlemen, I was there. When you needed me, I was there. Now, dear friends, I need you this time. [Mackin] George McGovern's approach to the black community... is exactly the opposite of Humphrey's. He is relying on that respected army of volunteers he has... and those volunteers have canvassed black communities all over the state. Shirley Chisholm is the unknown factor in the California black vote. She has not done well in other primaries, and certainly won't win here. But she will take black votes from both Humphrey and McGovern, and especially McGovern. Some individuals and some people involved... with the McGovern Campaign... and others who really did not want... Shirley Chisholm to run in California... because even if she only got... three or four percent of the vote... that could deprive McGovern of the nomination. By the time the California primary came... we all were very hyped up and working very hard... because our candidate, we were determined, was gonna win. Well, I said, 'Join the Chisholm Trail, "I had flyers... uh, information about Shirley Chisholm. People said, "Wow.!" Their response was as great as mine. We feel that Shirley Chisholm is the candidate. - There's no need to consider who else, when she can win. - [People Cheering] Shirley Chisholm has shown in word and in action... her support of the people's community survival programs. Shirley Chisholm has stood up in the face of racism-- a lone black woman denouncing the sufferings of black people. [Seale] To have Shirley Chisholm out front... is like a revolutionary act on her part... to re-evolve some of this political economic social justice party. As candidate for president of the United States... Shirley Chisholm running for president was just an automatic for us. Somebody said the other day, "With the Black Panthers endorsing you... and making contributions to your campaign, don't you damage yourself?" I said, "Let me tell you two things. First, there are a lot of people... who are not gonna vote for me anyhow." - [All Laughing] - Never vote for me. "Secondly, why don't you get behind the word 'Black Panthers.' "Get behind that word 'Black Panthers.' "First of all, ask yourselves, why did you have the development of such a group... "as the Black Panthers in this country? "Ask yourselves why they came into existence... "in the first place in this country. "Then after you get past that stage, you should say, 'hallelujah.' "'Hallelujah' because they're saying that they're going to try now... to use electoral politics-- They're coming back home." The party actually conducted voter registration drive... and did the precinct work for Shirley's campaign... and we raised money for the campaign. And so we were able to really put together an organization... that I think even today, as I look back, is a viable organization. That was how I learned how to fund-raise, you know? The fashion shows, uh, teas. we had dinners, we had all kinds of nightclub activities. They had blintzes for Chisholm. I never forgot that 'cause I didn't know what a blintz was then. And I volunteered. There would be a list of places and gatherings... and "coffee for Chisholm" and all kind of stuff for Chisholm. So this was the kind... of grassroots political organizing that we did... directly into Shirley Chisholm's campaign. I'm going to tell you something. I'm not here- - I don't have any advance men. I don't have any public-relations men. You know that not only am I literally and figuratively the dark horse... I'm actually the poor horse. The only thing that I have going for me is my soul... and my commitment to the American people. She must be dynamic. She make a man as old as me change his mind? My goodness. Shirley's candidacy said, "I'm not demanding to get in. I'm asserting my right to be here, and I am in." That's powerful. Whether you got five percent of the national vote... nine percent of the national vote or one percent of the national vote. Vote for Shirley Chisholm. Give me a vote, because I need strength. If I have the strength, we can get the input at that national convention. Very important. George McGovern won California's Democratic primary. He got 44% of the vote... Hubert Humphrey got 39% ... and other candidates got the rest. But under California law, McGovern was given all the state's huge bloc of 271 votes. Since then, the losers have taken another look at the law... and decided to challenge it as not providing the proportional representation... urged by the party's new reforms. California still had a winner-take-all primary... which George McGovern won the primary by really a very slim vote... but he won all the delegates. Well, his nomination hinged on keeping intact... all 271 California votes. [Cronkite] A challenge went today... before the Democratic Convention's credentials committee. And that committee dealt McGovern a stunning blow. The credentials committee decision takes away more than half... of McGovern's 271 California delegates, leaving him with 120. Hubert Humphrey, the runner-up, got 106. Sixteen went to George Wallace, who was a write-in candidate... and 12 to Shirley Chisholm. - [Phone Buzzing] - Let me get through. All right. Hello, there. Oh, man. I'm a mess. I am tired, I'm evil... and everything. Yeah. Yeah. What's happening on the election thing? Shirley Chisholm, I think... was probably on the liberal-to-conservative spectrum... probably had very little difference between herself and McGovern... which in the eyes of some said, "Why is she running and trying to make it hard for him?" Interesting question. Please understand that the reluctance... to embrace fully... a Shirley Chisholm candidacy... had nothing to do with the perception of her ability to win. Um, it was not so much anti-woman... as it was pro-leverage. Ladies and gentlemen of the press... my name is Walter Fauntroy... member of the Congressional Black Caucus... and leader of the delegation from the District of Columbia... to the Democratic National Convention. Gathered here at this desk are representatives... of uncommitted delegates... to the Democratic National Convention... representing a total of 96 and three-fourths votes. I think there is no question now... that the 96 and three-quarters delegates... who represent new additions... to the McGovern committed delegates... is enough to put us over the top... on the first ballot in Miami in July. Oh, Carl. You know, I tell you-- You know, i-it just gets to you. Because as I told a lot of the delegates that were calling-- A lot of the black delegates, uncommitted delegates, were calling me yesterday. They said, "What's going on?" I said, "I'm not part of that leadership team." If all the votes are delivered to McGovern... where is the leverage that black folks are going to have at this convention? Bye-bye. Yeah, I gave the story to him. He's gonna put it in the column in the Post. You know what Fauntroy told him? Fauntroy told him that he talked with Mrs. Chisholm. He told Mrs. Chisholm... that the delegates-- after he released the delegates... they could go where they wanted to go. - That- - That bastard! - That's not what he said. He sat here... and he said, "Shirley, you have to trust God and me. " - Yeah! - That's what he said. I love Shirley Chisholm. I loved her-her sense of conscience... her courage and determination. Uh, and so I saw, throughout this process... her as a valuable asset... for calling public attention, particularly in the minds of African Americans... that it's our time... to register and vote and make a difference. So that, um, I can understand her disappointment... because um, uh-- Well, I really don't understand. We got the best candidate for our interests. Frederick Douglass said something that she often quoted, and that was... "Power concedes nothing." It never has, it never will... without demands, without struggles. So when you asked me the question, what was her motives? It was the struggle. Power really is just a tool... and it's what you do with it that matters. Um-- If you don't have it, someone else will. And you'll be at their mercy. Congresswoman, when you first entered this presidential race... you had difficulty in making people take you seriously. Now here you are, nearing the end of the race. You are still the only woman entered in the race, the only black candidate. How do you see the Democratic presidential picture at this point? Oh, I think it's gonna be a hot time in Miami in July. [Dellums] The convention has two functions-- to establish a platform... and to choose its candidate for president... and then embrace the choice for vice president. It's as simple as that and as complicated as that. Shirley Chisholm, African-American woman... decides to run for president. She has now some delegates at the convention... and beyond simply the delegates, she also had... some capacity to draw people into the body politic. Which, in the vernacular of politicians... Shirley was potentially a broker. The way to do it in 1972 was to get enough delegates... so you could go to Miami at the convention... go into the smoke-filled rooms and say... "Okay, uh, McGovern. Okay,John Lindsay. "If you want my support, with all of my thousands of delegates... "you have to put this in the plank of the Democratic Party. You have to promise to fund Head Start. You have to promise to end the war in Vietnam." So I think she thought the ideal, the real victory... would be if she had enough, uh, delegates... so as an instrument she would be playing... not only to herself and for herself, but to effect change... using the power that the eventual nominee was going to have. Oh,just excitement. Mass of humanity, all half crazy... running around on the floor, bargaining. You know. It was like any other convention. ####[Festive] [Brownmiller] It was quite a year. I mean, it was an incredible time. There were more women delegates at that convention than there had ever been before. I don't think the men at that point still realized... that this radical women's movement was going to affect... their lives so radically. I am just so thankful that in spite of the differences of opinions... the differences of ideologies, and even sometimes within the women's movement... the differences of approaches... that here we are today-- a glorious gathering of women... which, at this moment in Miami... is being felt by every politician that is assembled here... to put together a ticket for the next four years. That is a step in the right direction. Today the black congresswoman and presidential candidate from Brooklyn, Shirley Chisholm... proposed that the 450 or so black delegates should stay together... for at least for one vote in the presidential balloting-- for her, of course. - My brothers and sisters, - [Man] Right on.! [Cheering] let me tell it to you this afternoon like it really is. The only thing that you have going, my brothers and sisters-- There's only one thing you've got going-- your one vote. [People Cheering] Don't sell that vote out. The black people of America are watching us. Find out what these candidates who need our votes to get across the top... are going to do for us concretely... not rhetorically. [Cheering] To look on the faces of the black youth of this country... as I went from one place to another, they said... "Chisholm, we know what you're going through. "We know how rough and how tough. "But we know you have the courage, the balls, the audacity... to shake this system up within the system." [Cheering] [Clay] Sometimes I question her-her motives. On certain- - In certain instances... I certainly question herjudgment. And even at times I question her sanity. Shirley Chisholm has been rejected at the polls... in state after state by black people. The black delegates at this convention have a mandate from their people... not to support Shirley Chisholm. But I wanted for the delegates at this convention... to put together a package to go to every one of these white front-runners... to deliver something to the black masses. That's all I'm trying to do. That's all I'm trying to do. But you see, the black politicians are no different from the white politicians. They've made their deals. They've made their contracts. And I have come down here and have eroded them completely... 'cause they didn't believe that Mrs. Chisholm knows how to maneuver and what have you. That has always been their problem with me. "Don't pay her any mind." But, you know, you can't wish me away. You can't. [Smith] Oh, it was hot. It was hot and hairy. Thad is saying, "We're not gonna make it. We're not gonna make it. "She's gonna get there and do something. "She's going to get there and make somebody mad. She's going to get there and she's gonna make a--" Who was supposed to-- Oh, Dellums. I think Dellums was supposed to put her name in nomination. "He's gonna get there, and he's gonna switch sides. He's gonna do this--" And I think he did. Now we see the beginnings... of a very powerful movement in this country... a movement that has only realized its potential power. Yet at this moment, cynical, even diabolical forces... are moving to stop the candidacy of Senator George McGovern. I therefore am now... endorsing the candidacy of Senator George McGovern. [Dellums] If there's any kind of way that-that-that,you know... we had thought that it could have been Shirley, then that would have been fantastic. We wouldn't even be here discussing it. It would be the greatest moment in the history of the world. But that wasn't about to be. Nobody was that naive. And so what is the wheeling and dealing all about at a certain point? There are two things, factors over which you have control-- your fidelity, and your willingness to show up every day for the fight. And I showed up every day for the fight, and I was faithful to my ideas. And at that convention, I was faithful to my politics, period, dot. That's all it was. [Cronkite] Good evening.Just one hour from now... the convention takes up the question of credentials... the seating of challenged delegates. The big one here of course is California, with its 271 delegates. The convention itself will be called upon to make the final decision on California. Do all 271 belong to George McGovern... or only 120, the number he actually won... on a percentage basis in that primary? [Richardson] Everybody is pledged to their candidate for the first ballot. If there's more than one ballot, all bets are off. You can vote for whoever you want. So, McGovern, to win this nomination... needed it on the first ballot. One of the first matters of business for the convention... was to vote on whether or not California would be winner-take-all... or whether they would allow the delegates... from the other candidates... to stay on the floor past Monday. There we were with our little delegate tags... and we found the California delegation... and there were seats for us way in the back... and there's Willie Brown and other people up in the front. [Richardson] Willie was an assembly member from San Francisco. I had never heard of Willie Brown till the day... we all convened as a McGovern delegation. And Willie, from day one, was in charge of this delegation. On Alabama, vote your conscience or vote with your union. - Okay. - Either way, okay? Of course, that winner-take-all deal was challenged... and then Willie, at the convention-- my mayor, Willie Brown-- gave that infamous "give me back my delegation" speech. I want to be able, as a chairman from any state... to stand before you in my just due... with my 271-man delegation... and to cast the votes of that unanimous 271-man delegation... and I don't think I deserve any less. What he's arguing is that they bounce those Chisholm delegates right off the floor. That is what he is arguing for them to do. That's what that was. And then-- And then Willie personalized this. Seat my delegation. I did it for you in Mississippi in '64... in Georgia in '68, and it's now California in '72. I deserve no less. Give me back my delegation! - [Cheering] - [Scott] His last thing was... "Give me back my delegates.! Give me back my delegates!" Pounding like that. And we were sitting there, and you know, here we are-- "Your delegates, Mr. Brown?" So we basically were not back on the floor after Monday... and the McGovern delegates... who had come anyway... to make up the full delegation... arrived on the Tuesday... and were there to vote for McGovern on first ballot. [Lee] But we stayed there. We stayed there. We were very much an integral part of the convention operations. We didn't just pack up and leave. [Man] Balloting will continue until a nominee is selected. The clerk will call the roll. - Illinois. - [Robles] And you know, at that convention... when it came to the roll call... the four of us, 'cause we were so fed up... held up the New York State roll call four times. [Clerk] New York. She said, "Look, they told me that we were not even gonna come down to Miami. "And look where you are, Victor. Regardless of what happens to me, we have-- we have made it." And so then and only then... with the understanding that on the first roll vote... we will vote for Chisholm. It was on the second ballot to bring the delegation together... that then we came, closed our ranks... and we then supported the Democratic nominee. [Man On TV] The hotel is the headquarters for Senator Edmund Muskie in Miami Beach. Senator Muskie is withdrawing from the presidential race. It is said that he intends to release his estimated 250 delegates now... to vote the way they wish on the nomination. It is apparent from what he has just told reporters... that he intends to throw his support to Senator George McGovern. ...a kind of battle developing. Now with Muskie and Humphrey pulling back... my strength is no longer important. You see, that has been the strategy. So I want to get in touch with Thad... because I want to release a statement to release my delegates to go where they want. Okay, fine. Thank you. All right. Well, we've just lowered the boom. We just have to pray over the matter. We have to pray over it. [People Cheering] And therefore, in unity-- in unity there is strength. I also want to make it quite clear... that it was the delegates here that made history tonight. The delegates that made history tonight. [Cheering] And so, in closing-- in closing, God be with all of you... and I pledge myself to crisscrossing this country once again... in terms of voter registration campaigns to swell those rolls... to unseat the incumbent, Richard Milhous Nixon, in November. [Cheering] [Woman Talking, Indistinct] And, um, eight students of Mills College... and five hundred-and-some-odd thousand Chisholm supporters. It's an analysis of the impossible dream. And I think I can say for the California delegation... of all of the reasons we could have come to the convention as delegates... we came for the best reason-- Shirley Chisholm. [Woman] I'd like to say, being a senior citizen... this is my first time attending a convention... and I think I would not have attended it hadn't it been for Shirley Chisholm. I'd just like to make two or three more comments. Let me just dry my eyes. I just got so filled with-- [Indistinct] Some of you were concerned about... someone who was with me from the very beginning... who suddenly broke the ranks after he got here. You know who I'm speaking about-- Congressman Dellums. You tell Ron to come home to Shirley. Take your time. I know he doesn't know how to come to me. I've gotten the messages. I'm not mad at him. I can understand the pressures and everything... that that man has had to go through... being the only black official out there in California... that stood out for so long, you know, with Shirley Chisholm... when everybody was ridiculing him and what have you, all right? So I want everybody to- - I want my people to know that there's no feelings. Now, the last thing I want to say-- Don't let the spirit die. Don't let the enthusiasm die. Just let's say... that this is a wonderful trip that we all took together during the past several months. That we have learned from our errors. God knows there are plenty. That we have gained experience. And that if there is to be a next time... we will start a little bit differently because we will have learned... and we will be able to continue. I am not "downheartened." I'm not disillusioned. I am not bitter. The only thing I continue to regret, of course... is that we didn't have the moolah. Add that, I think there would have been a lot of other things that we could have done. [Chisholm] The term "democracy, " as people mouth the term-- democracy--it sounds wonderful, sounds beautiful. But in real practice, it's not carried out. A lot of people will tell you that. They wouldn't tell you that publicly. I'm gonna tell you publicly. It's not carried out in the real sense of the word. When you realize what goes on behind the scenes. When you realize how people bargain for votes. How people make a deal in order to get three more delegates to a convention. That's not democracy. It's participation. They're participating in the process... but... at what a cost. When I die... I want to be remembered... as a woman who lived in the 20th century... and who dared to be a catalyst for change. I don't want to be remembered as the first black woman... who went to congress... and I don't even want to be remembered as the first woman... who happened to be black... to make a bid for the presidency. I want to be remembered as a woman... who fought for change... in the 20th century. That's what I want. [Chuckles] Martin, it's time for the football match. Get ready. The Game - It's football match. Come on. - No! (Dad doesn't understand anything about data, only football.) (Dad's been behaving strangely lately......... ....... He says he's stressed because of an important meeting tomorrow.) Martin, wake up! What a shot! Beautiful! OK? Are you coming? No, not that one. Jam? - Hi. - Hi, Martin. Come, let me show you something. See that graph? It's Rolf. Hi. And then she said if......

My son has been messing with it. Ops. Look. There some guy that.. (Usually dad gets hysterical when I touch his PC.) (This time I was the only one to help.) (It was my fault it went wrong, but dad is helpless about computers.) (If I hadn't fixed this... I would probably not be allowed to use a PC game....... again for the rest of my life.) Martin, you play center forward. (The fun after this is that dad now understands that you can learn from PC games.) (And have fun! ) Oy, The gym is so far It's such a shlep You go, goyim I figured since you're practically a gay man I should become a little Jewish Remember that gym we used to go to right around the corner? Ugh, it was so convenient The stupid State had to close it. just because a few people got held up in the steam room Couple of nude muggings, and the whole town is suddenly full of crybabies You know what? Forget it Instead of throwing myself into exercise, I'm going to throw myself into my work You do realize that when you're taking a spin class you don't pedal and you're really just listening to music I also was scratching my patch of eczema That had to have burn some calories I need an outlet for my frustration I just keep getting angry at everything Angry at Leo, angry at the gym - angry at you - Me?

You're a gay man This is a gay landmark Excuse me. The hospital where Judy Garland spewed out Liza Minnelli is a gay landmark This is just a bookstore Wait a minute... I think I have been here before Years ago Why yes, I have very fondle memories of this place - You mean fond - Both, actually William? I may buy a book If you're going to buy a book, you better do it soon Why? Are you gonna die? No. The bookstore is going out of business The rents are out of control We'll be closed by the end of the month That's terrible! I remember shopping here when I first came out Made me feel so proud to buy a gay book and have you slip it into one of your non-descript brown paper bags then put on my sunglasses and rush out of here praying to God no one would see me I know. I've been here so many decades, I've gone from calling Johnny here my roommate to my lover, to my... partner, to my late husband Oh. That's so sweet The history of one relationship reflects the history of our struggle Will. I think that's the guy who fondled me I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be closing Well, if you'll excuse me, I must go in the back and watch my stories If I miss "The Bold and the Beautiful," I become a raging bitch Tsk. I hate that this place is closing You know what, Jack? We-- we gotta do something Oh, I don't know Do something? That sounds complicated Jack, this--this is our history It's like the, the cradle of gay civilization where where gay man crawled from the straight ooze and, and for the first time, walked erect Continue We owe it to our community to to pay tribute to the literary giants who paved the way for us to live our lives openly - People like Oscar Wilde, James Baldwin-- - Oh, I love James Baldwin! It makes me sick that none of the other Baldwin brothers talk to him - But what can we do? - What can't we do? A prominent gay lawyer and a junior executive at a real gay network that only comes on after midnight when the Korean soap operas are over Ooh, we have a new slogan: "Watch us... please." And before midnight, it's: "Watch us, shipshiyo." You know what? Why not? I will save a bookstore today Ooh, but while we're here, can we check out lesbian erotica? I'm still trying to figure out exactly what it is they do Yeah. I imagine it's like bumper cars Honey, you sure you to do this job? You were a little weird yesterday That's because I was relating their happiness to my whole thing with Leo But you know what I realized? I'm happy they're happy If anything, it gives me hope that someday I'll be able to have exactly what they have Good news! The study's going to be a nursery - We're pregnant! - I'm outta here Um... Is she coming back? We didn't even tell her what colors we wanted the nursery to be Well, honey, she's a professional I'm sure she's going to ask the baby before she does anything What colors do you see? Oh. Well... uh... right now, everything's sort of purple and you two have kind an acid green aura Oh, you mean for the baby's room! Oh. Are- - Are you asking me to--? Well, you do work for her, and she kind left us hanging Right. Well... Um... I'm just spit-ballin' here, but how 'bout some clouds drifting across a blue sky? Oh, I like that What kind of blue? Well, you know, a soft blue, like a 10 milligram Valium blue And then... We'll do the mouldings in yellow Oh, that sounds wonderful A bright yellow? No, more of a- - Well, here, um... Lemme show you my swatches Big crowd, Will A sea of gay and lesbian lovers of literature Also known as a Who's Who of Uglyville Hi. This is a great party Wait, are you one of the guys who organized this? Why, yes I am It's a cause very near and dear to my heart My lord, you're tall Would you mind coming into the back? I'd like to reach for something I can't believe it So many people talked about doing something, but you actually did it Whoa, Whoa, whoa I am not a hero, okay? "Hero" is reserved for firefighters and our men and women in uniform I didn't say you were a hero There's that word again You're welcome Yeah, this place means too much to too many people and there is no way we are gonna let it go without a fight Thank God. Because to see an upscale gym in this place would just break my heart Exactly. I mean the whole-- I'm sorry. What was that? A gymnasium They wanna take over the whole building One of those exercise chains that perpetuate the myth of the narcissistic gay man How awful All those floor-length mirrors and tanning beds just around the corner from my apartment I don't suppose those corporate devils-- Is it Crunch? Uh, m-mentioned when this would be open by? Probably in time for those filthy yuppies to work off their holiday feasts and tone up their bodies for their fancy vacations at Lake George I almost wish that they would take this place over and then I could join, and not wipe off the equipment - But then I'd lose my store - Calm down, I remember Hello, everyone, and welcome These reading glasses I've used as an affectation for years to appear smart have once again... come to my rescue I never realized how important this bookstore was to the community until my.. very wise friend Will Truman said to me he said, "This bookstore is important to the community" So without further ado I give you Will Truman Thanks again for saving my bookshop from becoming an Equinox gym Yeah, I heard you old man So, we're, uh... We're here tonight to save a landmark of the community Where else can you buy gay literature? Well, besides online It's certainly faster, easier, and the wave of the future. But... For those who live in the past, we are here to preserve it This wonderful old bookstore Musty, pre-war Probably full of asbestos Gives you the lungs of a miner, makes you sterile, but hey, you got your book Heh-heh. Besides, it's not like you're-- like you're put on some government list every time you shop here You are And we'll be right back! Uh, Linus, go ahead and tell 'em about when Truman Capote bitch-slapped Tennessee Williams here and then later coined the phrase "bitch-slap" All right It was a hot August night... - Will, what is going on? - They want to put a gym here - A beautiful new gym! - Britney Spears Federline, a gym! That is fantastic Wait a minute What about the bookstore? Oh, who cares? So--so they sell a few less copies of some crappy coming out story "I'm so confused. I don't understand my feelings." Do a one-man show like everybody else! Will Truman, I cannot be what I'm hearing You are the most shallow, self-serving hypocrite I've ever met Get out Oh, this is good for that, too Get out! I hate having to tell that I can't do a job It's so unprofessional I hope they don't ask for their deposit back 'cause that money's gone Honey, don't you fret about that deposit 'Cause I've got a surprise for you Oh, my God. Who did this? I did. You like? I love But... You? I... Wow I mean, for you to do all this, you must've missed some pretty important black-outs It's okay, honey. I'll make 'em up I'll pull an all-nighter This is amazing - Karen, you did a really great job - I did, didn't I? Honey, you were in a jam, so I-I worked hard put my nose to the mirror-- And finished something Wow! This is so beautiful It's exactly what we wanted Yeah, this is great. We were a little nervous after our first meeting You kept calling the loveseat the "you're-gonna-die-alone-seat," but.. Anyway, it's perfect How did you pull it all together? Oh, I am beyond thrilled that you're happy But, I have to be honest with you I wasn't sure I could do this job Uh, but then, something came to my rescue A friend of mine A little friend I call... Inspiration Now, of course, of course, I'm only part of a team So none of this could've ever been done without... one other crucial component... Clients like you - You know, I can't wait to see the bedroom - Me either Let's go Come on, Karen Oh. Look One of my swatches - How did we do, Linus? - We didn't make it We fell $2,000 short Well... 2,500 My check's gonna bounce - Sorry, I feel like I let ya down - Well, you kinda did 50 years of my life... All gone... Just like that Well... Look at the bright side You've been breathing' in asbestos for 50 years so I'm guessin' you won't be sad for too much longer You open? I'm looking for a book about a gay guy that... feels really bad about himself That whole wall over there Well. Look who it is The worst thing to happen to gay culture since straight guys started dressing gay I know. I screwed up - We can't afford to lose this place - Well, I can't afford to keep it open Well, not that you care, but we're 2,500 short Maybe I can fix that Ugh. Will, that is so inappropriate I can't believe you're asking him to cash a check I'm writing a check to make up the rest, you dingus Oh, my gosh, Will This is the second time I've been touched in this bookstore I guess we've proved that a couple of guys can make a real difference in this city Thanks to us, people will still be able to see the spot where Gertrude Stein punched Alice B Toklas in the stomach and shouted, "Don't you come home 'til you've shaved!" - Well, at least for another month - What do you mean? This just covers November's rent I assume we'll be doing of these every month Next month, maybe we could put on festive holiday ball Oh. Every month... So we get to do this again Wow. Well, that sounds like fun Yeah, sure. We'll start working on that, you know... It's not like you can just adopt a cause and then abandon it We're abandoning it We won't let you down We'll letting him down You can count on us, Linus Can't wait for the gym to open! So close, sweetie. So close Where did you go? I turned around and you were gone I ended up having to take the subway Oh, did you invent that, too? What are you talking about? You took credit for my work, Grace! You were about to lose that job, and I covered for you, and you put your name on it That's how it works, Karen It's called Grace Adler Designs I'm the face of the company It's like--It's like with Colonel Sanders If you ran into him on the street, and you told him you liked his chicken he wouldn't say, "Oh, well, I didn't make it. Ramone did." He'd say, "Thanks. I'm Colonel Sanders. Do you know that we're doing salads now?" That analogy makes no sense at all Because in this story, it was my original recipe You're Ramone! - You're Ramone - You're Ramone Okay, look, this is ridiculous We're not gonna get anywhere calling each other names all day, Ramone I'm sorry you're upset But it's business I didn't do it for business I did it as a friend And you know what a friend does when another friend saves their ass? They acknowledge it Okay Thank you It's too late You know, for nine years, I have religiously shown up occasionally at this office... and I have never once cashed a paycheck And you know why? Because you're my friend Or at least, I thought you were All right I'm sorry.... Are we okay? No. We're not I quit - Are y- - Are you serious? - Yes.

I'm never going to be able to thank him. I should put a "do not disturb" sign on the door. You're grumpy this morning. grounded, but still it was a little hard to believe. Grr. Dad, the truth is, we've been together all morning. It couldn't have been one of us attacking the ship. Well, if it wasn't one of you, I'd say, we have a much more serious problem on our hands. - Rogue dragon rider? - Not good, not good at all. No, it isn't. And we need to find out who it is. Okay, gang, let's spread out! I've been thinking about this rogue dragon rider. - Dagur. - It makes sense. If Dagur has a dragon and is attacking ships, - then who's to say we won't be next? - Hiccup! You got to see this. Those are some deep gashes. Any idea what it could be? This dragon is extremely powerful. It has the slashing attack of a Speed Stinger yet from the depth of the strikes it appears to be as strong as a Typhoomerang. Yeah... You guys, you find anything else? Yeah! This ship has been stripped of everything valuable. - Nothing over here. Right, sis? - Nope, no-thing. Zilch. Not a thing in front, behind, or to either side of us. You know I can see that, don't you? Alright, alright, but we get to keep it. - Yeah, finders keepers. - Losers... I... losers don't get this 'cause it's way too cool for a loser. Yeah. - A barb! - That looks like one of Stormfly's. Which means the dragon we're looking for could belong to the Sharp Class. In fact, I'd bet my Meatlug on it! No, no, don't worry, girl. It's just an expression. I'd never do that. Tuff. Ah, you! - Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking? - Oooh! Good game, Hiccup! You think of something, and we'll try to guess what it is. If we do, we get a prize. Alright? Think away, my good man. And let the game begin. Hmm. Let me see. I'm thinking you two are muttonheads. Yes! I win! I was actually thinking, if we find the dragon, we find the rider. And I have a pretty good idea of how we can find the dragon. Sharp! Did I say that it's sharp? I know, Bucket. We've gone over that 20 times. Well, it's got a very long tail. And it can tie itself into a knot. Yes. Yes, that's right. And two large wings to slice. - So? - I've never seen anything like this in Book of Dragons or Bork's papers. But there is one place we haven't looked yet. So, I'm thinking, since Stormfly is also a Sharp Class... Her magnesium blast could possibly illuminate some information about this new dragon. Stormfly, easy now. Just enough to light it up. Deadly Nadder. I must have missed this the first time around. Who's got some chalk? I have to translate it. Fishlegs, now's not the time. Speed Stinger! One of my favorites. There's always so much to learn. - Oh, my Thor! - I know, Fishlegs. I got it. Later. - That's it! - It's called a Razorwhip. Okay, Fishlegs, do your thing. Okay. Razorwhip. "Sharp Class dragon. Long, spiny, barbed tail. Very aggressive. Very dangerous." Yeah, we got that. Give us something new. - You want to do this, Snotlout? - Duh! I would... but I'm just... you know... I don't feel like it right now. Continuing on, this symbol indicates that it can use its tail to wrap around a victim and literally squeeze the life out of them. Unless it's in a hurry. Then it just slices you in half. Punch me, because I must be dreaming. Ow! Fishlegs, is there anything about this dragon that won't kill us? - How about its eyeballs? - No. Poisonous tears. - Poisonous! I love it! - Yeah. Poison's fantastic. Fishlegs, is there anything that might help us locate it? "Top speed, mating rituals, oral hygiene, feeding habits..." Wow, wow, wow, wait. Go back to that one. - Oral hygiene? - No! Feeding habits. If we can figure out what this thing eats, then we might figure out where it eats. - Mhm. Sea slugs! - Where? - It eats sea slugs. - Slugs? I hate those slimy monsters. They're just snails without homes. Giant homeless snails! We've come across a few islands out there that are just crawling with sea slugs. Hopefully, our Razorwhip's feeling hungry. And hungry for sea slugs, not Vikings. I have a good feeling about this island. - That's what you said about the last five islands! - Isn't my fault. I'm an optimist guy. I'm a "yak bladder half full" kind of guy. I don't mean to burst your yak bladder, but does anyone consider what will we're gonna do if we actually find this Razorwhip? - You can marry it. - And what if Dagur's riding it? Well, then Ruffnut can have him. It will be complicated, but I will one day learn to love him as my own. - Um, Tuffnut... - Like a little babe, a child that I carry in my arms. But he's too heavy. - Guys, look! Smoke! - A campfire. This dragon builds campfires? Give me the "Twins serve a purpose" speech again. Quickly? Yeah! I've only heard the "Twins are muttonheads" speech, which is also very good. - Okay. - Okay, or you don't have to. - Could be the loot from the ship. - And these gashes look familiar. Alright, gang, let's split up and search the island for our rogue rider and his Razorwhip. He can't be far away. Fishlegs, you and Meatlug stay here, - signal if they come back. - You got it. You know, Meatlug, ordinarily, I would pretend to be upset at being left behind, but to be honest, this time I just feel a lot safer being here with you... All right, sis, you look left and I'll look right. - Wait! My left or your left? - We have the same left. - We're twins. - Right. Who are we kidding? We're never going to find this thing. And all I see are trees! All I see is my dream of spending my golden years with a Razorwhip vanishing right before my very eyes. Help! Oh, ouch, ah! An eight? That is way too many Ruffn... Whoa! Ugh! These tracks look pretty fresh. Stay sharp, Stormfly. Stormfly? Chicken? Oh, no! Huh? Take us down, Hookfang! Hurry! I knew we should've gone before we left. Can't a Viking get some privacy? Hookfang! Oh, gah! Oh, no! Hookfang! What is it, bud? Nice work, Toothless! Let's get him, bud! Toothless, look out! Whoa! Look out! Toothless, give me all you've got! Now, Toothless! Now! I wouldn't do that if I were you. I wouldn't, either. Heather? You rolled me into a river! You trapped me in a cave! - You left me dangling in a tree! - And I have to admit, the chicken move brought back some memories. Guys, now I'm sure Heather has a really good reason for doing what she did. Right? Look. I've been living on my own out here for years and I made more than few enemies. I didn't want you guys to be involved. I needed to send you back to Berk. You couldn't have just, I don't know, said that? - Would you have listened? - She does have a point. - We're pretty stubborn group. - I don't listen to anyone! Heather, whatever problems you have, whatever enemies you've made, we can help. You don't have to be out here alone anymore. Hiccup, please, just let this go. We have a base not far from here. Why don't you come back with us? Nothing permanent. We'll get you some provisions and catch up. You can see how you like it. Whoa. Razorwhip. This is the best dream ever. Like I can reach out and touch it. I can reach out and touch it! Mmm. Cold, scaly. I, Tuffnut Thorston, take thee, Razorwhip, whatever your last name is, insert it here, to be my... Oh, hey, Heather. And what are you doing in my dream? At my wedding. - I didn't put you on the list. - You're not dreaming, Tuff. Oh! Well, in that case, Razorwhip attack! Run! - I see nothing has changed. - Yeah, same story, different year. - Let's head over to Dragon's Edge. - You're not gonna give up, are you? - Not likely. - Okay, Dragon's Edge it is. You're gonna love it! - Wait, where did you find her? - More importantly, can we ride it? Did you miss me? I think you did. That's why you threw that tree at me. Isn't it? Playing hard to get. Me likey. Never mind him. How did you train a Razorwhip? - It's incredible! - Actually, I owe a lot to you, guys. - To us? - To me. She meant to me. I mean, how much more obvious can she be? Ahh, women. I totally understand them. Okay, great. Check you later! - When I found Windshear... - Awesome name! I bet you ride like the wind, shearing through it! Get it? I used both of the words in its name to explain - why he's called that. - Oh, gods. Anyway, when I found her, she'd been hurt in a fight with a Typhoomerang. Windshear held her own. Didn't you, girl? But she needed to be nursed back to health. Then when she was better, I used the training you guys taught me on Berk. We've become the perfect team. We're unstoppable. I mena, look at her! No one can take us down. And if they try, they'll be sorry for it. Ha! I guess she's pretty cool, but not as cool as this. Hookfang, flame up! That's cute. Windshear, tail slice! Oh, gah! Ha! What's so great about... Okay, we'll call it a draw. Whoa. What else can she do? Her breath can burn the flesh off a human from 100 feet away. You're gonna get me outta here? One single blade of her tail is as deadly as the sharpest battle-ax. Great having Heather back. She's so... I don't know, intense, hardcore. I love it! Yeah, it's great. She's definitely grown up since the last time we saw her. Hiccup, it's been three years. We were just kids. We've all grown up. Yeah, but she was so sweet, and now she's so... I don't know. Edgy? What's wrong with that? I like it. Astrid, there's edgy and then there's destroying ships. - Which I still need to ask her about. - Well, do me a favor and wait until after I ask her about her battle-ax. I want her to show me how to make one for myself. Let's do this! Come on! Is that all you got? See? Hardcore. I don't suppose you want to talk to her, do you, bud? Yeah, thanks again for everything. Eat up, girl. You'll need all your strength for what we've got coming. - Heather? Uh, we should probably talk. - Sure, about what? About the ship, the one that you and Windshear destroyed. - Oh. That ship. - Heather, what are you doing out there? I'm just taking care of business, Hiccup. - Nothing you need to worry about. - Yeah. But I do worry about it, Heather. If dragons are attacking ships, I worry. Look, Hiccup, a lot has happened in the last few years. We're not kids anymore. Everything's changed. - This isn't you. It can't be! - It is now. The last time you saw me, I... Never mind. - I-If you want me to leave... - I didn't say that. No, whatever it is you're going through, we can help. All of us. - There's always another way. - You're so sweet. Thank you, Hiccup. You've always been a great friend to me. Hey, hey. Sssh! It's okay. Sorry, guys. Nothing personal. Okay, bud, let's get some answers. Come on, just turn around. Let me see your face. Okay, this is getting strange. Thank you, Johann. It's always a pleasure doing business with you. Ah. The feeling is quite mutual, Miss Heather. I can assure you, I enjoy our every transaction. Toothless! Okay, Johann, let's see what we can get out of you. I'm sorry, Master Hiccup, but I've been sworn to secrecy. The Chief of the headhunting Asmat tribe from Papua New Guinea couldn't part these lips! Really? How about Stoick the Vast of the Hooligan tribe from Berk? Do you know what trade sanctions are, Johann? Two words that should never be used in the same sentence? Right then! Where shall I begin? Let's start with why Heather is out attacking the ships all by herself. It suppose that would have something to do with her entire village, including her own family, being decimated by a rather nasty group of undesirables. She's made it her personal mission to avenge her island and her family. By sinking and looting ships? She's not looting. She's redistributing back to the victims of those horrible crimes. Every ship that Heather attacks means they'll get back some of what they've lost. Of course, lost loved ones can't never be replaced. But why? Why now? Why her? Many "whys," Master Hiccup. None of which I can address at this very moment. - Johann, why do we do this? - Sorry? You know you're gonna tell me. I know you're gonna tell me. So why not save us both the trouble and just... I suppose you do have a point. Picture, if you will, a brilliant sunny day on the Emerald Isle of Karantha when I received a mysterious correspondence from a little boy. Yet again... Johann! Where is Heather going? It's not merely where she's going, Master Hiccup, it's who she's going after. There! There it is, Windshear. Remember, girl, we're doing this for my mom and dad. For our whole village. I want my face to be the last thing Dagur ever sees. What in the name of Thor? Sir, that dragon's been circling up there for a while. Hm. Never seen one of those before. Nor have I. What should we do? Well, you know what I always say. When in doubt, take it out. Fire! Wait for it, wait for it... Now! No! Reel in that spiny menace! Whoa! Well, hello, Heather. Pull harder! She can be useful to us! Very useful. We got this, girl! Or not. Heather! ~ Subs by anoXmous ~ ~ resync by Asuna @ Subscene ~ In the beginning you don't know it's the beginning; that things are just starting. Then all of a sudden they're off. Things become altogether different than you thought. At first there were only twelve apostles. That was before I found my six apostles. Before the world got better. I should tell you the story from the beginning, when I still lived with my parents. THE BRAND NEW TESTAMENT God exists. He lives in Brussels. He's an asshole. He's horrible to his wife and daughter. There's a lot of talk about his son, but very little about his daughter. His daughter is me. That is my father. He's God. Even before the creation of the world my father was already bored. So, he made Brussels. [GENESIS] - Voila.☻ He'd made a few things; a few other creations, but they didn't work out. Something's not right. So, he created man in his image. With him, he could do as he pleased. Ah, much better! Much better. Enoch begat Irad. Irad begat Mehujael. Mehujael begat Metuskael Metuskael begat Lamech. Et cetera, et cetera... That's when it all started. He set one against the other. In his name. For God! For Allah! For Baal! Voila, now you know exactly how it came about. That's me. I'm called Ea. This is where I was born, and where I was stuck for ten years. It has no entrance and no exit. Three room apartment, fully equipped kitchen and laundry. And my father's office, where no one is allowed. It's forbidden to watch anything but sports on TV. This is my mother, a pitiful woman, 100% certified browbeaten. She never says anything. When she's not embroidering flowers, she looks at her baseball card collection. ...and that makes eighteen. It's complete. Ea, we eat at the table and as a family. Do as you're told! You're in MY house, here! What? I'm your father. Put that fourth plate away, it won't bring him back. You never know. Not at my right hand. I told you before, it bugs me. Stop that. Stop! You're not your brother. Just because you can't do it... Because I don't need to be able to. My father lived in a crappy place, which he never left. He had a crappy life, had never loved his wife and couldn't make things with his hands. SILENCE! I'm working! He needed something to relax and forget all that. That's when he got the idea of humanity: All his toys, that he could watch suffer and struggle. A lot of misery and a little happiness, to give them false hope. It took him 8 years, but after all, it worked pretty well. My father attained a certain degree of virtuosity. Since then, he spent his days inventing new Laws of Universal Pain-in-the-assness. I need to formulate this right. Law 2127: The quantity of sleep, needed, is always ten more minutes. Law 2129: When a body is submerged in a bathtub the telephone rings. 2125: A slice of bread always falls jam side down, otherwise the jam is on the wrong side. Law 2126: dishes never break until after they've been washed. Law 2218: The next line always moves faster. Law 2231: pains in the ass never come one at a time. Why are you looking at me like that? Lower your eyes. It's disgusting what you do to people. What? You don't even know them, you just amuse yourself by harming them. - You've been in my office? - Anybody could do better. I've forbidden you to go in my office. - You got nothing to say to me. - C'mere! See what I have to say to you? Look! See how furious you make me, huh? That's no good! Just at that moment I decided to do something. Maybe ten years, is the limit of what one can put up with, I dunno. Anyway, I knew exactly what I wanted: to do better than my father. But first I wanted to hurt him. I wanted to make him suffer. To wreck his life like he wrecked mine. You could call it, anger. But once I'd done it... I'd have to leave. EXODUS Psst! Hey, J.C. - Hi, sis. - Hey, J.C. I need your help getting outta here. - I hear you. What did mama say? - Nothing for fear of getting smacked. It's about time she woke up. I wanna do like you; split this joint. Find some Apostles to give me a hand. Apostles are a good idea, I tried 12, but it got a bit messy. I thought 12 was a good number, like a hockey team. Mama's number is 18. She says you can play baseball with 18. How many apostles should I get? Try six. With my 12, it makes 18, like mama's baseball players. How should I choose the apostles? Go with your feeling. You don't have to justify it. Choose any six from papa's archive, give'em a little miracle, and you're set. I can't make miracles. Just a small miracle, something you can handle. Then with your 6 apostles, write a Brand New Testament. - I don't want'em talking about me. - Make it about them. A Brand New Testament in which the apostles talk about themselves. - That'd be so totally new! - You know, I can't write well. Delegate to someone who can. You think I wrote mine by myself? To escape, I hacked the washing machine. Set it on 'synthetic fibers' 40 degrees, 1,200 rpm spin cycle. It'll open a passage. In a few hours you're out. Thanks, J.C. you're cool. Don't forget, without his computer papa's nothing. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) Births / Deaths LAWS DISASTERS MEN / WOMEN . do not open Death Dates DO NOT OPEN Births ........... Deaths Send death dates? Benoit, you have 14 years, 6 months, 4 days to live. Robert, you have 0 days to live. Willy, you have 54 days to live. Jean-Claude, you have 12 years, 9 months, 5 days to live. Aurélie, you have 11 years, 6 months, 27 days to live. Marc, you have 83 days to live. Francois, you have 25 years, 3 months, 8 days to live. Martine, you have 5 years, 2 months, 17 days to live. - Psst! Hey, J.C... - You got the files? Yeah, I sent everybody their death date. Papa's gonna lose all credibility. He'll be hopping mad. Super idea! Giving men knowledge of their own death... Crazy! It's still impossible to say if it's a hoax or if these death dates will prove correct. Who could know when people die? It's impossible. I don't believe it. And yet there are troubling coincidences. For example a fridge fell from a cargo plane at the precise moment of the victim's predicted demise. Andrée, you have 2 minutes to live. It's a special day for this janitorial technician. Overnight he's become the longest lived man in the world. 102 years to live! It's a record! From the social networks we have this. Hi, I'm Kevin. 62 years to live. 62! Test! - Shit! - Darling... darling! Even if cellular regeneration is programmed, length of life depends on unforeseeable factors. It's random. It's impossible for it to be predetermined. 12 years, 4 months. And you? 64 days. It's not fair! I've been taking care of you for years, and you'll live longer than me. Ea. Since this morning's announcements many people did not show up to work. "What'll we do with the rest of our lives?" is the most frequently asked question on social networks. How has this changed you? It won't change anything. I'll continue as before. Rosalie: 10 months, 12 days to live. Georges: 16 years, 11 months, 21 days. Rosalie: 10 months, 12 days to live. Rosalie: 10 months, 12 days to live. Mama! We're back in the studio for a news update. Fighting has stopped in most war zones, in the wake of 'Deathleak'; . the disclosure by an unidenitied source, of our dates of death. Goddamn! What is this? On the social networks we have this: I'm Bart. I still have 12 years to live and I'd like to make the Titanic out of matchsticks. Shit, goddamn, fuck, shit! Henri, 6 years to live. What I want, is to learn to play the helicon*. (sousaphone) Goddamn, Goddamn, shit! What the hell? ! Goddamn, Goddamn, shit! What's this? EAAA! Ea, get on my computer and fix what you screwed up! Open up! Ea! Come back! Papa's not angry. EAAA! It's the fish-burgers. - What? - The fish-burgers. They're made from bits of stranded whales. When a whale gets stranded somewhere, they don't throw it out, they sell it. And make fish-burgers out of it. Do you know how to write? - A bit. - Then, you will write. Can you take me to this address? I have no time. No time Why are you following me? Leave me alone. Scram! Anyway, I'm dyslexic. I don't write well, and I can't even read, Then learn to write. You wanna end up a bum, like me? What do you want me to write? - The Brand New Testament. - What for? - Can you turn water into wine? - No. - Can you walk on water? - No. Then you won't get far. He was called Victor. His sweat smelled of salt, garlic and lemon. He had skin like an old serpent waiting for a glass of blood at the counter, in a deserted bar. Just the type I'd have liked as father. What's that? An incinerator. It's beautiful. There should be more. - So, ever go to paradise? - Paradise? Yeah, around here. If this is paradise, it's so fucked up, I could've made it myself. - Paradise is after death. - No, there's nothing after death. Paradise is here. Adam was here and my brother came here too. - But he got himself killed. - Told ya! - What's your brother called? - J.C. J.C.? Like J.C. Van Damme? - Who? - Jean-Claude Van Damme. Dragon Eyes, Double Impact... Didn't you see Double Impact? Universal Soldier? You haven't seen anything. You're an odd girl. - As if I had nothing better to do! - Are you leaving? Yes, I'll find her. I tell you that little psycho will suffer. You've never been down there. It's dangerous. You know what your daughter did? She fired off the death dates! How can I fix this, without the use of my computer? Do you get it? Before... I had people by the balls, 'cause they didn't know when they'd die. I had'em beat; walking on eggs Understand? But now, they know. They won't be shat on, anymore. They can decide what to do with the rest of their lives. Understand? Oh? What if, like her brother, she falls in with some fanatics? And does tricks with glasses of milk, yada, yada... Do you realize the consequenses? Imagine if she shows them how to get themselves out of shit. I, um... I... I... No, huh? You don't get it. You don't understand anything. You say nothing, because you understand nothing. Why do you understand nothing? Because you don't think at all! You think of nothing but embroidery and baseball players! I detest baseball! Goddamit, Goddamit, Goddamit, shit. I'm going. Help me! Here. Hello. Hello, I'm here about your arm and the metro. THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO AURELIE The first apostle was called Aurélie. When she learned how much time she had left to live she decided to change nothing but to continue as before. Aurélie is a super nice girl. Oddly, she lives alone. Aurélie is a babe, a fox, a bombshell, a great piece the doormat of the whole building. Her mother was Dutch, her father, no one knows. Perhaps a Lapplander, given her porcelain complexion and dark hair. Anyway the combination turned out really well. But, porcelain complexion and dark hair don't suffice to make a babe. You also need a laugh like pearls scattered on a marble staircase. Seven men in her building are sincerely in love with Aurélie. Two of them are over 84 years old. another is under eleven. 218 men just want to bang her. And for almost all the women, she's just a slutty cock-tease. Yet, Aurélie lives alone, and her heart, her melting-butter heart, is as sad as a little heap of cinders. When I was seven, my arm was ripped off by a subway car. Don't ask how such a thing is possible. It was just, me here, and my arm over there. In its place, now, there's 600 grams silicone. Who are you? My father is God. I ran away from his house. I gotta find six apostles. You're the first. And him? That's Victor. He'll be writing the Brand New Testament. You need to talk about yourself. Myself? ... I dunno... One day I was alone and a guy came up to me. the type of guy who sleeps on bits of cardboard. His eyes were two red balls in a heap of flesh He reeked of alcohol, rotting flesh, perspiration and urine. Like a dead camel in a distillery. As he approached, I thought he'd ask for money, or pull out a knife or show me his cock, as sometimes happens. But none of that happened. He just came near I could see he wanted to tell me something. My eyes stung a bit from the odor. But I smiled at him. It's a reflex. Then he spoke. In his voice there were, like, thirty people cracking nuts. He said: Girly... Life is like a skating rink. a lot of people fall. A lot of people fall. How do you write 'skating rink'? Two t's or two n's? His two-bit philosophical phrase stuck in my head. Often, in the morning, when I look in the mirror... I can't help thinking of it. Are you young or old? I'm still young. I dunno... - Is your mom young or old? - She's old. Do you remember when your mom was little? - No. Why not? Because I wasn't born. - Will you get old, too? - I'll die before then. What are you doing? I collect people's tears. I don't know how to cry. There are lots of things I can't do. But I can hear people's music. Everyone has their own music. Do you wanna know what yours is? Yes. It's Handel. It's lovely. Tonight I'll invent a dream for you. Do you know when you'll die? I dunno, I never had a telephone. The second apostle was not at home. THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JEAN-CLAUDE For a long time, Jean-Claude was one of the greatest adventurers the world has ever known. Then one day, nobody knows how, it stopped. Then his life became very small. It's called reality, an ugly thing. First Jean-Claude became assistant vice-manager of a shopping center, sub-level 2. Then Jean-Claude climbed the corporate ladder to become Budget Manager of the Monitoring Department. That means I encode numbers. Jean-Claude, 58 years old... single, no children. Jean-Claude lived a shitty little life. He traded the hours of his life for a shitty job with shitty hours. When he found out how much time he had left to live... he sat on a bench. And he decided never to move again. So, if there were no air, would birds fall? Dunno. How can fish breathe? They have gills. I'll make a note of that. - Could I have gills? - No, you're a child. What becomes of children? They become parents. Somtimes. - What became of your mother? - She died. Why did she die? Because she was old. - What becomes of old people, then? - They die. Your music is 'Le rappel des oiseaux' by Rameau. He says he likes you. Why does he stay in this park if he can fly anywhere? He says, he could ask you the same question. He's gone. An apostle who's not there, isn't that serious? No, I don't think so. All we needed was to get acquainted. Excuse me... I'm looking for a girl with black hair, a bit sickly... It hurts. Why did you do that? Oh, that was me. Damn. EA! EAAA! Hey you, bum! What the fuck are you up to? Eating out of garbage cans? I'm looking for a girl with black hair. You can't eat out of a dumpster. That garbage isn't yours. And you stink. I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding! That's because I smashed your face in. He has nothing on him. Found between two cars. Does it hurt when I do this? Moron! Of course it hurts! It's a sprain! I know, because I created sprains. And migraines. That was me too! - Give me morphine. - Sir, we don't just hand it out. Aw, shut up! I'm sick of you. Don't piss me off, asshole! - Gimme that, I'm hungry. - Are you out of your mind? THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE SEX MANIAC The third apostle was named Marc. He called himself "sex maniac". ♪ Change me ♪ You wanna change me ♪ it's so much easier to change me than try... Marc didn't think of his parents, often. But when Marc thought of them, usually the same memories came to mind. I remember the caravan model 'Comtesse' which my parents bought on a ten year mortgage. A few cubic meters that smelled of soap, tanning lotion and tomato sauce. Through the anti-mildew curtain you can hear the rain falling on the campground 'Manga del Mar Menor'. I'm nine, and my life changed, barely three hours ago. Legs, long like pulled taffy a turquoise bikini as big as two dots and a comma. She looked at me with a strange expression a mixture of interest and disgust. I wanted to eat her. I smiled stupidly. She was the daughter of the German family. Of course, I have many other memories of my childhood. What's strange is, that in each memory there's a little sadness. You see my eyebrows? As if I was making an effort. Naturally, I AM making an effort. I try to prevent all the images in my head from bursting out of my eyes and splattering against the clean walls of my parents' living room. For two years, the image of the German girl, with her caramel legs the contempt in her eyes and the violent turquoise of her bikini have never left my mind. Then other girls came along. The hairdresser's daughter. The one with the cute nose and tight pants. - The baker's daughter. - With Her doe eyes which looked so sad, it seemed as if she'd just been crying. Cathy, the neighbor's daughter. So timid, that when she talks, it sounds like a tire blowing out. He hit it! Papa, he hit it! What becomes of children? They become adults. And what becomes of adults? Sometimes they have children. Will you have children? I don't have the time. Not in 83 days. And first I'd have to meet a girl. Look at the girl. Smile... unless she says something sad. Lesson 2. If she touches her hair, say: - I love your hairdo. Very original. - I love your hairdo. Very original. - You're different from other girls. - You're different from other girls. I really love your hairdo. Very original. When he learned he had only 83 days to live He thought, time is too short. He hadn't a day to lose. I thought, I'll empty out my bank account. 18,000 euro, 83 days to live, 200 euros per day, and the rest for food. It's all there. At the same time, so close at hand yet so far away. I want them all, all... Life would be like a miracle. Let the days pass and take me towards death. Nothing matters anymore, my life will be as I dreamed. Never, in my life, I'd imagined days so full of happiness. Days flavored of fresh fruits, days flavored of grand mysterious voyages salty flavored days, days of infinite beauty. Until the day I ran out of money. 200 euros a day is a bit short. Salty flavored* days ... Does 'gout*' have an accent? - Why isn't everything free on earth? - I don't know. Your music is 'O Solitude' by Purcell. It was written for a voice like yours. You have a very nice voice. You could try to earn some money with your voice. Test. 1, 2, 3 ... Test. Perfect. When you see the 'H' start. - OK. - Ah, ooh... - Aah... - More, more. - Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes... - Great. Oh good! - Ahh! OK, very good. I'll just change the roll. Ah, Proust. 'In Search of Lost Time' "For a long time I would go to bed early" I especially like Elstir. I can't figure out if he's really in love with Andrée or if it's to make Albertine jealous. Just 'to call a spud a spud'? * Pardon? 'call a spate a spate'.* - There's some sadness in Proust. - I think so too. Through his secondary characters Proust 'in a grain of pepper'* manages to 'pull the doughnuts out of the fire'.* I like the way you talk. Excuse my French, I always 'put my mouth in my foot'. The way you said "call a spud a spud", is lovely.* Why? Isn't that how you say it? No. - Manga del Mar Menor. - Bitte? (sorry? ) Manga del Mar Menor. The campground. The beach. That boy was me. Das kleine Kind, das war ich. - Wirklich? (Really? ) - Ja. - Das warst du? (That was you? ) - Ja. It's been a pleasure. Would you like to... Yes. My heart is pounding like a 'stammer'. Mine too. - Good night. - Good night. ... 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 13, 14, 15! Andale. Piss off. Stand in line! - This line's faster. - Get back there! No, no... I'm god! Such a beautiful face. It radiates peace. God tells us, 'love your neighbor as yourself'. - I never said that. - Pardon? - I never said that! - No, I... I detest myself, so I'd never say it. I'd say, I dunno... detest your neighbor as you detest yourself. But that guy, there ... screwed it up. He improvised. Went with his feelings. See? But 'I' am God. I invented all the crap. You're a nice guy. Hm? - Got a big heart? - I try. You're daydreamer. Ludovic. Your mother died when you were five. No? And you were grief-stricken. And you got polio, afterwards. Oh, poor Ludovic. One leg shorter than the other. How, sad! And little Cécile. Remember Cécile? Lovely little Cécile! You were in love with Cécile. You loved Cécile, huh? When you gave her flowers, what did she do? Laughed in your face! She laughed in your face because she was with that asshole with a moped. And you couldn't ride a moped because you had one leg shorter than the other. All that was me. ME! Understand? He is nothing. All he succeded in doing was getting himself nailed to a coat rack*, like an owl. I'm GOD! Are you sick in the head? THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE ASSASSIN The fourth apostle was named Francois. The day everyone learned how long they had to live Francois bought a rifle. If he shot his target and missed it meant, it wasn't that person's day to die. If he killed the person, then, it wouldn't be his fault. It was written. Francois was merely the hand of destiny. He'd always loved death. He loved funerals. Francois never cried. He was never sad. He called himself The Assassin. The Assassin had slain according to this partial list: Ants: number, unknown. Flies: number, unknown. Butterflies: six. Estimates by The Assassin. His cousin's mice. Two parakeets, still his cousin's Poisoned by 'spirits of salt'* (HCl) in the food dish. The Assassin knew that he was an assassin ever since as a very small child he became aware of himself. At the same time he realized there was a world outside himself. At the same time he became aware of the great frontier separating the world of life from that of death. I knew I was the 'Ferryman'. I was made for taking lives, it was my deep nature I couldn't help it. Like hair color, or shape of the nose, it's genetically coded. I'm an assassin. My focus, my raison d'etre, my vocation is ... killing. Today The Assassin is 41 years old, At this stage, what's important to know about The Assassin is that his wife is named Catherine. They had a child; a boy, by mutual accord, called Grégory. Catherine doesn't know that The Assassin is an assassin. She usually calls him - 'Cheri' - in the daytime, on the phone, or with friends. Sometimes - 'Bunny-rabbit'- on certain nights: or - 'Francois'.- during serious discussions or arguments. Francois was one of the many victims of 'Law 1522' invented by my father. If, one day, you fall in love with a woman, there's a great chance you will not spend your life with her. Francois used to sell life insurance but quickly realized that his job served no purpose. For your last day, choose one of our fifty destinations. Treat yourself to an end that surpasses all that preceded it. Hi, Kevin here again. Why do you shoot at people? If they die, it's not my fault. It's their time to die, today. If I miss ... this wasn't their day. - Is your gun loaded? - No, not yet. I should tell you it's not your fault. I fucked up all this shit. I sent off the death dates to get revenge on my father. I thought I could do some good for people. Now I must find six apostles. You're the fourth. Your music is 'The Death and the Maiden' by Schubert. It's sad but beautiful. It would go well with Handel. You should try shooting a young woman with chestnut hair. Go ahead. She'll pass by in six seconds. One crocodile, two crocodiles, three crocodiles four crocodiles, five crocodiles, six crocodiles... - How'd you do that? - That's her. Shoot. Shoot! Shoot! What happened? A miracle. I don't love you. I don't love you. I don't love you. I don't love you. Yeah. A little tired, that's all. Excuse me ... I love you. I've never loved anyone. I'm married, I don't love my wife. I don't love my son, either. I never loved my parents. I've never loved anything, anyhow. Except you. I love you and I will always love you. If you don't love me, it's fine. I'll go live alone, waiting for death, thinking of you every day. I wrote my number on the wrapping. She'll call you. 13, 14, 15, 16 ... Hi, still Kevin. 62 years to live! THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO MARTINE The fifth apostle was called Martine. In the beginning, when she still lived in the land of childhood Martine's heart was composed, 95%, of gooey, perfumy stuff which predisposes you to romantic love. Some things, you can't change. Martine, you have 5 years, 2 months, 17 days to live. - I won't be here, tonight. - What? I have a meeting in Düsseldorf, with the Germans. - Oh. 'Morning, Madame. Feel like a coffee? My husband came by the house. He got a message that he had 39 years left to live. I told him I had five years. It seemed to comfort him. Is 200, OK? You have beautiful hair, Madame. Thank you. Would you mind not calling me Madame? You have very beautiful eyes, too. Thank you. What's your name? I'm called Philippe. Oh, yes... Don't look. When I see people, I hear their little music. Everyone has their own little music. You... have circus music. He says he likes you. It's the first time something so beautiful happened to me. Such lovely proof of love makes me so happy. Never mind, I'm fed up with that thing. Make yourself at home. Want something to drink? Sure you don't want to sleep inside? I can't sleep unless I see the sky. Victor had done 6 months in prison. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. When he got out, he couldn't stand to sleep with a roof over him. He was afraid of waking up locked up. 17. How do you know, you love me? You don't even know me. I shot at you. I hit you and nothing happened. Then I followed you, I could smell your odor. It's like watercress. And I fell in love. All right, come. Oh, shit. Ea! - Who's he? - My Father, God. I never imagined him like that. Praise Myself! You're coming home and you'll reboot my computer. You don't scare me. See what a state I'm in? Why won't you reboot it? Why won't you reboot my computer? And put a stop to this crap. I'm never coming back! Do you like it here? I'm happy, I got lots of friends. I just need one more apostle, to make 18. STOOOOPP! Stop it, with your 18 apostles. 12! There are 12, like hockey team. It works, it always has! I told your brother. You want 18 because your mother loves baseball. But, FUCK BASEBALL! You always loved your mother more than me. *Bai He Quan, the White Crane! I've seen it. 'Way of the Dragon'? The Cunning Elephant. Forget it, Victor. Let's go. No. Give me your hand. Ea! Don't make me come over there! Ea, get back here! Ea! Ea! We fished him out of the canal. Dry him out on the mattress with the Uzbeks. THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO WILLY The sixth and last apostle was named Willy. When Willy found out how long he had to live he decided to become a girl. Willy was my own personal miracle. Willy has always been sickly. You know what skin cancer is? I've told you before, eh? Time for your injection. He never had anything serious like cancer or stuff like that but sick, nevertheless. Always. When we were alone my mother used to look at me. A funny look. Like I was a box of tacks still lying around after she'd just cleaned house. Then she said I looked like hell. - You look like hell. - And that I should keep calm. You have to keep calm. And then she gave me that darned injection. Deep inside, something told me all was not right with my mother's injections. Can we increase the dose? I know it's difficult for you. You're doing all you can. The doctor liked my mother. He spoke to her, as if to a draft horse, that he pitied. He thought, it can't be easy to have child in fragile health. He cast a worried glance me, as if he found it odd that I had any temperature at all, since I puked, morning till night, a sort of greenish bile. By the age of 7, I'd had an operation on my pancreas because the synthetic anti-diabetics my mother shot me up with, daily, had burned it out like a hamburger. Then, what was supposed to happen, happened. It's next Sunday. In a week. I know. It's my fault. I released the death dates. You did right. Afterwards, everything changed for me, for the better. Your mother and I ... felt we should be honest with you. You'll die on ... You still have ... a few weeks. We didn't tell you earlier because you might... Is there anything you'd like? Do you want to quit school? Take a trip? Whatever... we'll agree. Can boys become girls? What? I'd like to be a girl. Are you sure? Parents are such jerks! My friend's parents... when they found out, he was gonna die, kept him locked up. He wanted to live as Alpha Arceus. That's an aluminum Pokémon. At first they said OK. Then, they preferred that he listen to J. S. Bach, for the ten days he had left. I felt like shooting myself! We live in a totally shitty world! I know, it's my father's fault. - Your father? - My father is God. Couldn't get along with him, so I split. My mother, too, is a goddess, but doesn't dare say anything. She embroiders, all day. My father makes her zip her mouth. Sometimes I miss my mother. 18. This changes everything. 18! Just like baseball. Does your father have powers like a superhero? - Just power hungry. - Do you have powers? You can multiply ham sandwiches! Doesn't always work, just sometimes. Sometimes the ham's missing There's lots of stuff I can't do. Crying, for example. There's lots of stuff I've never done. I've seen nothing of the world. I've never eaten an apple, I've never seen the sea. Your music is "La Mer" by Charles Trenet. It's nice. Tonight, I'll invent a dream for you. Willy, at least, eat the fish. ♪ La mer, qu'on voit danser Le long des golfes clairs ♪ A des reflets d'argent, la mer A des reflets changeants sous la pluie ♪ La mer au ciel d'été Confond ses blancs moutons ♪ Avec les anges si purs. La mer bergère d'azur infinie - He said he wants to return to the sea. - I understand that. Good idea taking him to the sea. I'm gonna die in a week, might as well die at the seaside. That's a great dress. Totally awesome! OK, I think, we need to help the kids. Yes, I think so, too, we need to help the kids. We have a week to wrap it up. MONDAY: Willy sold his parents' furniture. Travel is expensive. TUESDAY: Aurélie asked The Assassin to stop assassinating. Please don't shoot at people. I've lost interest in that. WEDNESDAY:, Martine put her life in order. Ah, back already? What's this crap? I want you to go away and never come back. Oh, I say! Oh, you were marvellous! THURSDAY: Marc and Xenia made love for the first time. And they liked it. My mother availed herself of Thursday to wash the windows.

I'll turn you into a stutterer and a premature ejaculator! SONG OF SONGS And on Sunday everybody was at the seaside. Seems I'm not the only one with the idea of dying by the sea. I didn't dare say it, but it's true seems everyone had the same idea. Would all those dying today, come get a black armband. Those accompanying them, get a white armband. All those dying today, come get a black armband. Those accompanying them, get a white armband. Voila. What will all the black armbands die of ? All we have to do is wait. Won't be long. Any chance of it not happening? My brother said, with 6 more apostles, it'd make 18, like in baseball. And that would change something, because it's mom's favorite number. He must have been mistaken.

Couldn't you, maybe, shave your legs? We'll see. Goddamn, shit. ~ Subs by anoXmous ~ ~ resync by Asuna @ Subscene ~ Hi, it's Kevin again. In the beginning, you don't know it's the beginning. You don't know it starts. And suddenly, here we go! Things become different from what you thought. In the beginning, the apostles were only 12. That was before I found my 6 apostles. Before the world became a better place. I have to tell you the story from the beginning, when I still lived with my parents. THE BRAND NEW TESTAMENT God exists. He lives in Brussels. He's a bastard, he's horrible to his wife and daughter. We've heard a lot about his son, but little about his daughter. His daughter, that's me. This is my father. This is God. Even before the world was created, my father was bored. First, he made Brussels. GENESIS He had made a few things, a few creations, but it didn't work. Something's not right. So he created man in his image. With him, he could do whatever he wanted. That's much better, much better! Henoch begat Irad. Irad begat Mehuiael. Mehuiael begat Methusael. Methusael begat Lamech, etc, etc. This is when it really started. He set them against each other, in his name. For God! For Allah! For Baal! So... Now you know exactly how it happened. This is me. My name is Ea. This is where I was born and where I was locked up for 10 years. No door in, no door out. 3-bedroom apartment, with kitchen and laundry room. And my father's office, where we're not allowed. On TV, we can't watch anything but sports. That's my mother, a pathetic woman, 100% certified sloppy. She never says a thing. When she doesn't embroider, she contemplates her baseball collection. And that's 18. Full set. Ea! Here, we eat at the table and as a family. Do as you're told! This is my house! What? I'm your father. No fourth plate, it won't get him back. You never know... Not at my right hand! I told you it irritates me. Stop it. Just like your brother... You can't even do that. I don't need to. My father lived in a stupid place that he'd never left. He had a stupid life. He'd never loved his wife, and he couldn't do anything practical. Quiet! I am working! He needed something to relax and forget all that. So he came up with humanity. All those little toys he could watch as they struggled. A lot of unhappiness, a bit of happiness to give false expectations. It took him a while, but surprisingly it worked pretty well. My father had reached a certain level of virtuosity. Since then, he spent his days inventing the new laws of "Universal Annoyance". Law No. 2127. The required quantity of sleep is 10 more minutes. Law No. 2129. When you immerse a body into a bath, the phone rings. 2125. Toast with jam always falls jam side down. Otherwise, it's that the jam was on the wrong side. I like that... Law No. 2126. You only ever break dishes after washing them. Law No. 2128. The other line always moves faster. Law No. 2231. There's never just one hassle at a time. Why are you looking at me? Lower your eyes. It's disgusting, what you do. What? You enjoy hurting people you don't even know. You broke into my office. Anybody would do better. You can't go into my office. - Leave me alone! - Stay here! Look at what you make me do... Look at the state you're getting me into. That's wrong. It was at exactly that moment that I decided to act. Maybe 10 years is the limit of what you can tolerate. I don't know. Anyway, I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted to do better than him. But first, I wanted to hurt him, I wanted him to suffer. I wanted to ruin his life the way he'd ruined mine. You can call that anger. And then, once it was done... I was going to have to leave. EXODUS Hey, JC! - Hi, little sister. - Hi, JC. I've gotta get out of here. I understand. What does Mom say? She never dares to say anything. She's gonna have to wake up. I want to do like you, find a few apostles to give me some help. Apostles are a good idea. I had 12, but that was a bit rough... 12 seemed right. Like in a hockey team... But Mom says that you need 18 people to play baseball. How many apostles do I need, then? Try with 6. With mine that'll make 18, like Mom's team. How do you choose apostles? Pretend like you know, no one will ask. Pick 6 out of Dad's files, work a miracle and that's it. I can't accomplish miracles. Just perform a tiny miracle, like the ones you do. Then, with your 6 apostles, you write a brand new testament. I don't want to be popular! It'll be about them. A brand new testament where apostles talk about themselves. That would be brand new! I don't write so well... Find someone who does. Do you think I wrote mine myself? To get out, I hacked the washing machine. Put it at synthetics, 40 degrees, spin 1200 rpm. In a few hours, you're out. - Thanks, JC! You're so cool! - Don't forget... without his computer, Daddy is nothing. Do not open Dates of death Birth - Death Send death dates? Benoît, you have 14 years, 6 months and 4 days to live. Robert, you have 0 days to live. Willy, you have 54 days to live. Jean-Claude, you have 12 years, 9 months and 5 days to live. Aurélie, you have 11 years, 6 months and 27 days to live. Marc, you have 83 days to live. François, you have 25 years, 3 months and 8 days to live. Martine, you have 5 years, 2 months and 17 days to live. - Hey, JC! - You got the files? I gave away the death dates for everybody! The old man is going to lose all credibility. He's going to be mad. Terrific idea! To give mankind the awareness of their own death... Awesome! It is still impossible to know whether this is a trick or if these dates will be true. Who can know those death dates? This is impossible. I don't believe it. There have been disturbing coincidences. This refrigerator fell from a cargo plane when the victim's counter ran out. Andrée, you have 2 minutes to live. This is a special day for this maintenance man. He suddenly became the man who will live longest. 102 years to live, man! The record! Also on social networks... Hi, I'm Kevin. 62 years to live! 62! Testing! Shit... Sweetie! Cell regeneration is foreseeable, but the length of life depends on such unpredictable, random factors! It will always be impossible to determine. 12 years and 4 months. And you? 64 days... It's not fair! I took care of you all these years, and you'll outlive me! Ea? Following the announcement, many people didn't go to work. "What will we do with the rest of be considered armed and dangerous. - So her sister kept quiet? - Yeah, to the grave. 'Cause she knows if she breathes a word, I won't do her again. (BRAKES SQUEAL) (CELL PHONE RINGING) - Anything? - [BILLY]: No, she's not at her exam. But you know what's weird? Neither is Trey Burgess. Who is that? They did a project together at the beginning of the quarter. He was always hitting on her, trying to get her to smoke weed. The TA gave me his address. He lives in a dorm. - Willard Hall. - I used to live there freshman year. I'm five minutes away. What dorm number? - You sure? - Yes, give it to me. 713. What about you? You find out anything? Maybe. I'll call you back. Hi there. What can I do you for? This is going to sound kind of strange, but my grandfather disappeared last night, and I was hoping you could help me find him. He's got pretty advanced Alzheimer's. Here's how I see it. The first time a man hits his wife, she's a victim. The second time, she's an accomplice. Harsh. Hey. Isn't that our BOLO? The Saab? 216 DCB. Sure is. - 641, Dispatch. - [OFFICER ON RADIO]: Go ahead, 641. We have our suspect vehicle. His next-door neighbor said he saw him leave about 3:00 with a friend, but I have no idea which friend be left with. But I did find this receipt from here. It looks like they were here about 7:04. Do you have a surveillance camera? (CHUCKLES) Oh, no. We're not Home Depot. Were you working yesterday at 7:04? I'm always working, dear. I own the place. Maybe you remember my grandfather and his friend? - Hmm. - 'Cause that was... Sir, if you wouldn't mind, checkout is right at the front. - Thank you. I will. - You come back and see us, now. [OFFICER ON RADIO]: Do you have a visual? [ASH]: Negative. Can't tell if it's occupied. Non-emergency off the air until cover arrives. Standing by for cover. Start us more units. - It was a pretty big sale. - Oh, yeah, I remember this. Only it wasn't two guys. It was only one guy. He wasn't your grandfather. He was only about 40. Oh! I know who it is. I think it's the guy my grandfather used to go fishing with. His name is Digger... - and his nickname's Digger. - Mmm-hmm. Um... I don't know his real name, though. Did he use a credit card, by any chance? - Nope. He paid with cash. - (JILL SIGHS) - Do you remember anything else about him? - Well... I know that he drove a 1990 Chrysler Imperial with 176,000 miles on it. I only know that 'cause he told me. (CHUCKLES) Pretty proud of that crate. No idea why, but he parked it right up front. - What color was it? - It was kind of a burgundy. Can I give you my phone number in case you remember anything else? You know what? I know where he lives. How's that? He told me that the powers that be at the Royal Hotel evicted him because his car took up two parking spots. They can evict you for that? I figured he was pulling my leg about that. I don't know. I've never heard of that. Royal Hotel? - Um... it's up on Halsted, I think. - Thank you. Thank you so much. You're welcome. I hope you find him. Uh... Female emergency. Do you have a restroom? Sure, yeah. Right this way. It's in the back. There you go. (PANTING) Officers, what's going on? We're looking for the owner of a vehicle parked outside. It's young woman, blonde hair, blue eyes. I don't know if it's who you're looking for, but there's somebody like that in the restroom. - Where is it? - She'll be right back out. Show me. (RATTLING) (PANTING) Can you please hurry it up in there? Hello? (GUN FIRES) [ASH]: We have shots fired! One from inside the bathroom! Police! Open the door now! (THUDDING) [McKAY]: On the floor, on the floor! She's gone. She bailed. She went out the south side of the building. (SIREN WAILING) (BARKING) - Hey, can I bum a cigarette? - We don't smoke. Sorry. Yeah, I shouldn't, either. My mom died from lung cancer when she was 47. It was the worst, most tragic thing ever. How do you guys like this neighborhood? I'm thinking about moving in. It's okay. Our school's two blocks that way. We eat lunch at home. How lame is that? There's hardly anything to do here, you know? The nearest mall is really far. Yeah, I hate that. Anyway, bye. Hey. I know something that would be totally fun. How would you like to see Justin Bieber at the Rose Garden? Are you serious? He was just here. I didn't think he was coming back. Oh, yeah. My brother's his tour manager. I've had dinner with him three times. I can get you backstage passes. (INAUDIBLE) - Oh, my God! - You're not serious. (CELL PHONE RINGING) So what's Justin like? Where's bad cop, huh? Is he typing up my arrest warrant? Jill, it's Hood. Listen to me. You know what? If you don't want to do your job, that's fine. - Listen. - But you got to stay out of my way. My mom. - I thought she died of lung cancer. - It's a long story. - [TREY]: What? Leave me alone. - [JILL]: Trey, it's important! Open up. (BANGING) I'm not leaving. - What do you want? - You missed your econ final. Yeah, I had a gig last night. I overslept. Who the hell are you? - I'm Molly Conway's sister. - Who? Oh. - Yeah, she missed it, too. - So? - Was she at your gig last night? - (SCOFFS) She hates me. She thinks I'm a drug addict. Why would she be at my gig? - I want to come in. - She's not here, all right? Hey! What the... Molly? Molly! (PANTING) [TREY]: Crazy bitch. (DOORS SHUTS) Okay, let's call it. Units can go mobile. - We lost her. She's in the wind. - [HOOD]: Maybe not. Hang on. Her last call just pinged off the Tyler Street tower. That's inside the perimeter. She could be just laying low. [POWERS]: Who needs this shit? Call the cab companies, call the car rentals. Get her ass in here! (BEEPING) Shit. (PILLS RATTLING) (EXHALES) Excuse me. Hey. - Do you live around here? - Yeah. I was hanging out with a friend the other day, and this guy came and clipped my car and just drove away. Her little brother looked out the window and said he saw this crate. - A dark red Chrysler Imperial. - Yeah. That's Jim Lapointe. - Who is that? - He lives right below us. 2A. Awesome! Thank you. He's okay, right? He's not going to shoot me in the head if I knock on his door and ask for his insurance, right? He might. He's pretty weird. My girlfriend says he's got "repay eyes," so I don't know. - Okay, thank you. - Yeah. (KNOCKING) Hello? (CLICKS) (GASPING) (SCREAMS) Help! (SOBBING) Help! Help! Someone, help me! (CREAKING) - (MEOWS) - (GASPS) (PANTING) - Can I get you anything else? - [MAN]: Just the check. - Hey! - (GASPS) - Hey! Hey! - (THUDDING) I'm the janitor! What did you do that for? I thought you were someone else. You have no right to put your hands on me. Well, you have no right to be snooping around on private property! - You're right. Sorry. - (GROANS) Are you okay? No, I'm not. So, this guy, Mr. Lapointe, did he leave a forwarding address? Nope. He moved up north. - Where? - Man, you really messed up my wrist. Did he say where? He just said he was going to tie up some loose ends and head north. What, does he owe you money or something? No. He used to do lawn work for my aunt and she died. She left him $20,000 in her will. - Oh! That's some lawn work. - Yeah. She was crazy. And mean. She was really mean. She didn't give me a cent, actually. I did everything for her. (SIGHS) Of all the days for my car to break down. - Do you want to make some money? - Always. - Do you have a car? - Barely. It's a hunk of junk. I always figured if I met a girl as pretty as you, money would change hands. I just thought it would be in the other direction. (CHUCKLES) I must be crazy. - This time tomorrow, right? - Yep. Key under the right rear. - You swear? - Yeah. - What if you don't show? - It means I'm dead. (CELL PHONE RINGING) I can't believe they involved you in this. Jill, it's my job. If I needed you, I would have called you. You know that. Yeah, under normal circumstances, of course you would. Just tell me what's happened. We always talked about him coming back like it would never happen, like it was just me being paranoid. But we were wrong and he did come back and he took Molly. And if anything happened, I swear to God... The police tell me that you're carrying a gun. Yes, I'm carrying a gun! But if I turn myself in, then no one will be looking for her, and then he'll kill her! Shh, sweetheart, listen to me, okay? Just breathe and listen. You have suffered terribly this past year, but you came to understand your anxiety, and that it was never to be acted upon. Isn't that what you've learned? Now, the police, they don't believe he ever existed. I do believe he exists, and I know what happened to you was real. - You believe me, don't you? - Yes. But at the same time, I know that he hasn't returned. When Molly behaved irresponsibly, when she wasn't home when you expected her to be, it triggered memories. (SHAKY BREATHING) (GASPING) Oh, God! [DR. ANDERS]: Jill, he's gone and he is never coming back. He belongs to your past now. No. Sweetheart, come in right now. Talk to me. Before you hurt yourself or somebody else. I'll come up. - But only if you do something first. - What? Tell Sergeant Powers to leave, and when he's gone, I'll come up. What are you talking about? There are no police here. You're a liar. - No, I... - I'm parked downstairs, and I can see his unmarked cop car right in front of me. - Jill. - My judgment isn't impaired. She's downstairs. Suspect's vehicle downstairs. Take her. If it's rolling, put a stop on it. (SIRENS WAILING) Hold up. (SIGHS) - [SHARON]: Ready or not, here I come. - (BOYS GIGGLING) Where are my boys? I can't find them anywhere. (DOORBELL RINGS) Is one of my boys at the door? I need to talk to you. Come on out, boys. My friend is here. We'll play hide-and-seek later, okay? Why don't you watch some TV? Good spots. I never would've found you. Go ahead. I never would've found you. Have you been to sleep yet? Molly disappeared last night and the guy who took me took her, and it's going to get dark soon and he's going to kill her. I think I know who it is. I think it's that customer. The guy that gave us the big tip last night, the one that you said was moving away? - Jim? - "Jim"? You know his name? - Yeah. - Do you know him pretty well? No. He comes in every couple of weeks. We chat. - Did he ever ask about me? - No. He stares at me. Last night was the first time he's ever sat in my section. The only thing that he said to me was, "More coffee, please". I think he was just afraid that I would recognize his voice. (GASPING) It's time. Oh, God. You never got a good look at him? - Have you ever seen him with his car? - No. So you don't know anything else about him? No, not really. He lives alone. He works odd jobs. I asked him why he was moving, and he said he didn't like the women here. I said, "Why, what's wrong with us?" "Too skinny". I said, "Well, I'll take that as a compliment". Nothing else? - Well... - What? Tell me. I have his phone number. I threw it away out here. He gave it to me last night. Here's what I think we should do. I think we should give it to the cops and let them... Jill. Jill. Don't do this, Jill. Please, you need help. (TIRES SCREECHING) (SIREN WAILING) - [JOHNSON]: Are you kidding me? - [CUMMINS]: Here we go. - [JOHNSON]: Okay, it's on. - [CUMMINS]: Yeah, she's going for it. (RADIO CHATTER) [CUMMINS ON RADIO]: Orange Bronco. Oregon plate 071 Charles Baker Victor. (TIRES SCREECHING) (HORN BLARING) (TIRES SQUEALING) Hey. Jill just left a friend's house in Ladd's Addition. Now her friend hears sirens and she's scared. There's a pursuit rolling in Ladd's Addition right now. Where's Hood? His mom's sick. He says he's bringing her soup. Oh, great. Check with dispatch. Find out what they're chasing. (SIREN WAILING) [CUMMINS ON RADIO]: 951, we're southbound on Carver. We've lost sight of the suspect vehicle. [JOHNSON]: She's blacked it out. She's taking the alley. [OFFICER]: Roger that. [JOHNSON]: There it is. All right! In the car, show your hands! - What the hell are you doing here? - Where are your car keys? - Why? - Just please give them to me. No. If they catch me, they're going to throw me back in the hospital, and they're going to ask me a thousand questions, and I'm not going to be able to answer, 'cause I'm going to sound crazy. They're going to stand there with their notepads, and they're going to make me take all these pills, and when I refuse, it'll make me seem even crazier. Meanwhile, Molly is going to be dead, buried at the bottom of some hole in Forest Park, along with all these other girls that nobody's looking for. And then, one day, someone's going to accidentally stumble over their bones. And the cops are going to say, "Wow, what do you know? That Conway girl was right". And they're going to go on living their lives. But I will never be able to do that because I know that I didn't do everything possible to save my sister. And so how are you going to feel when you didn't help me? - [BOY]: Mommy, I'm hungry. - [SHARON]: Yeah? What you want, sweetie? Do you want an apple? (FRIDGE DOOR CLOSES) My keys are in my purse on that desk. And don't you come back here. (DOOR OPENS) (ENGINE STARTS) (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) (BRAKES SQUEAL) (DIALING) (RINGING) - (ON PHONE) Jim here. - Hi. Who's this? - Jill. - Jill who? You know who I am. I know who you are. And I know you have my sister. I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. (GRUNTS) You stared at me for months. You finally sat at my station last night, and then you went and you broke into my home, and you meant to take me, but you took my sister instead. - Is this Jill from the Lucky Star? - Yes! Stop it! Stop it. I left you a pretty big tip last night. Yeah. And then I went to your house to kidnap you? Why would I do that if I knew you were working the night shift... like you always do? But you're right about one thing. I do know who you are. You're that poor girl who was abducted last year. The one no one believes. The police said it was a hoax and that you were crazy, right? Pigs. You sound like you're in a very bad place right now. Would you like to meet me... and see that I'm not the monster you think I am? Maybe then you'll relax. Be happy. Smile. You may even like me. Okay. Do you want me to come to you? Or do you want to come to me? (STAMMERS) I'll come to you. Where are you? I'm sort of homeless right now. I'm just tying up a few loose ends before I move back north. Here's what you do. Cross over the St. John's Bridge and turn right onto Bridge Avenue, and take it to Springville Road for about three miles. On the left, you'll see an abandoned ranger station. Call me when you get there, okay? And, Jill, you drive careful now. (JIM HANGS UP) (EXHALES) (ENGINE STARTS) (CELL PHONE RINGING) - Hello? - [BILLY]: Hey. Molly's back. - What? - I'm at your house right now. She's here. - Are you serious? - (LAUGHS) Yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That means that... - Put her on. - She's in the shower. - What? - Stop being such a weirdo. She's back. Look, she was so stressed out about the exam, she went out with Sarah. Not to drink, just to watch, right? Of course, she got wasted. Passed out on the couch, slept right through the test. She was too embarrassed to call. She just came back 20 minutes ago in a cab. Now she wants us to take her to an AA meeting. Unbelievable. I know, so hurry up. She's dying to see you. Billy, put Molly on the phone, please. I can't. I told you, she's in the shower. (LINE RINGING) [POWERS ON PHONE]: Yeah? - Hey. Okay, she's on her way home. Okay. Then will you ask her something for me? What? Ask her why she went out drinking in a pajama top. (CHUCKLING) Jill. Uh... (SIGHS) Look, I'm freaking out over here. There are cop cars parked outside. They're not gonna talk to me about Molly. All they care about is you. So unless you turn yourself in, they're never going to look for her. - I'm on my way to meet him right now. - Who? The guy who took her. - I just got off the phone with him. - Wait, he... - He admitted it? - No, but he's the one. (DIAL TONE) Hello? She says she's meeting the guy who kidnapped her and Molly. - Where? - I don't know. - (SCOFFS) Jesus. - Yeah, that's what I said. So what if Jill isn't crazy? What if this guy really does have Molly? She's still missing. Something must've happened to her. (CELL PHONE RINGING) What do you want? [POWERS]: What the hell do you think you're doing? Your job. You think this is how an investigation works, you are dreaming, Jill. You know, I'll tell you where Molly is. She couldn't stand looking after you one minute more, so she took off. She needed a break. That's why she moved in, you know. To babysit you. - It was my idea. - No. Yeah, I thought without some human contact, you'd end up in a hospital for the rest of your life. [JILL STAMMERING]: They don't believe me. - They think I made it up! - [MOLLY]: Okay, okay. Shh, shh! - They won't even let me go home. - Just come here, okay? I'll talk to the doctors and I will get you out of here, I promise. - No, she would've told me that. POWERS: How? There's no telling you anything, Jill. You won't let anyone help you. - Now, look, you do as I say and you... - (LINE BEEPS) That's him. Ji... (SIGHS) [JIM ON PHONE]: You're at the ranger station? Yeah. Good. Turn left out of the lot. Do you have Molly? Please tell me the truth. I don't have her. Soon you'll see a road, but it's not well-marked. I see a chain. That's it. Get out and move it. Hold on. Take the road? Yes. How far? Until it ends. Forest Park is a magical place, isn't it? I come here all the time. Did you ever hear about the little girl who lived out with her father? They lived in a cave together for years. They bathed in a brook. The water kept their perishables cool. They grew a garden. Instead of her going to school, her dad taught her everything he knew. They were very, very happy and no one was the wiser. When I read about what happened to you, I couldn't believe they called the search off after only one week. Did they really think they'd find a hole in the middle of 5,000 acres so easily, when this little girl and her father were never discovered? Will you tell me something? Sure. How did you escape? They said you overcame him. What does that mean? It was a couple of hours after the sun went down. - (SIGHS) - [MAN]: It's time. (GASPING) Oh, my God. [JILL]: There was a bone. A forearm, I think. (SNAPS) Maybe it was a shin. It was broken, splintered. [MAN]: Sweetheart, I'm here. - (GRUNTS) - (MAN GROANING) [JILL]: I really don't remember much, but I do remember that I had never felt so cold and tired in my life. [JIM ON PHONE]: And he'd never been so mad. You got away. You made a fool of him. I bet he didn't like that one little bit. Can I ask you something? Sure. What did you do to the girl whose bone I found? How did it split into two like that? - I'm at a fork. - Turn left. Where does right lead? Back to civilization. Am I close? Keep driving. You're waiting for me? Of course. Hello? You there? You're a brave girl. Driving out in the middle of the night to meet a man you hardly know. How far? When the road ends, get out of the car. You'll see a footpath. Take it. You'll know you've reached my campsite when you see a lantern. (STATIC CRACKLING) I'm losing you. Uh... - Hello? - There's no service out here. (STAMMERS) But we've been talking. Where are you? You're waiting, right? Right? - Hello? - (LINE GOES DEAD) (GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION) (REDIALING) Come on! (LINE BEEPING) (PANTING) (WHIMPERS) (GRUNTING) (FOOTSTEPS) (GRUNTING) (TAPE RIPPING) (GASPS) (GASPING) (GASPS) Molly! (PANTING) (BANGING) (GRUNTING) (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) [LONSDALE]: Wait, Molly's here! She's here! [BILLY]: Molly! Molly! - Hey, come here. Oh, my God! - Billy. - Where were you? - Under the house. (SOBBING) He grabbed me when I was sleeping, and he hit me, and he drugged me. Where's Jill? - Where is she? - [LONSDALE]: Hey, listen. Listen. We have to get you to the hospital. Not till I see Jill! Where is she? Molly, look at me. She's meeting some guy, okay? She thinks he is the one that took her and that he has you now. What? What? - You never believed her. - [BILLY]: Come on. He's going to kill her this time! How could you let that happen? You have to stop her! You have to stop her. Molly! Molly, I'm here! (GASPS) (THUDDING) (GROANING) [JIM]: Welcome back. Just us again. And the others. Poor Jill. The girl no one believes. Not even the police. But you and I know the truth, that this is where you belong. It was so easy to lead you back. I think you never wanted to leave. Remember this? (JILL GRUNTING) (JIM GROANING) - (GUNSHOT) - (JIM GROANS) (PANTING) (GRUNTING) - (GUN FIRES) - (JIM SCREAMS) (JILL PANTING) Don't move, you fucking coward. Where's Molly? Kill me, and you'll never know. - (GUNSHOT) - (SCREAMS) Where is she? Get me help first, and I'll tell you. If you tell me where she is, I won't shoot you again. But you have five seconds. You stupid bitch, she's alive. She's under your house. She's been there the whole time. My God. Oh, my God. I told you the truth. You said you wouldn't shoot me. I won't. (JIM GROANING) [JIM]: Hurry! I need help now! No! Please. Please don't. Please. (YELLING) Please. You said you wouldn't kill me. Please! You said you wouldn't kill me. I lied. (JIM SCREAMING) (ENGINE STARTS) (BEEPING) (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) [OFFICER]: Sergeant, incoming. [LONSDALE]: Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey! - It's my house. - [LONSDALE]: Let her through. Let her in. (SOBBING) He drugged me, he tied me up, and he put me under the house! - Shh. We're safe. - He's going to come back for you, Jill. - He's not going to stop. - We're fine. - We're going to be safe. - Okay. Okay? - Jill, where's the gun? - There's no gun. - [POWERS]: What happened out there? - (STAMMERING) There was nobody there. What do you mean? Jill, somebody pulled your sister out of that bed. - That guy you were meeting? - He never existed. It was all in my head. (SIGHS) (TAPPING ON KEYBOARD) Powers?

What should we do, seriously? What about that man? What? What happened to that man? The man who had a sword. What are you talking about? Falling sick during your first debut appearance... What is all of this? You being nervous up to this degree, How are you gonna cope in the future? I did not faint because of that. What? There was a man... Mmm... Okay, just take it easy. Just take it easy. You've reached detective Madsen. Please leave a message. Damn it. Okay. Okay. All right, pick up. Pick up. Come on, pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Doc's comics, go for Chet... Chet! Thank God. Listen, I need you to pull the Alcatraz Park Rangers rules and procedure manual from the file drawer. I need to know if the cells at Alcatraz were ever retrofitted with release locks in case a tourist ever locked himself in. Now what kind of idiot would lock himself into a prison cell? Chet, either you pull the manual in the next ten seconds or I'm telling Rebecca you own the Twilight movies on blu-ray. All right, all right, hold on. You said there's an emergency office in the Ranger Station, right? Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, that's right. - Okay, good. Lead the way. What about the other two guys? No offense, but I can't be responsible for you. You're going to need backup. You got a spare gun? No offense, but you're a ranger. I can handle myself, honey. I didn't show up at Sally Port yesterday. "Sally Port"... that's an interesting choice of words. You want to tell me where you got that uniform? On your knees. Now. Take it easy, honey. On your knees, now. With me. Madsen, I'm out. Go! Come on! Come on! Come on! Open! Hauser, come on. Hold on a second, Pinky! Pinky! Take it easy. Take it easy, Pinky. Take it easy. We ain't getting behind that door. We need to stick to the plan. They're gonna pay. All of them... Starting with the man in the hole. Pinky? Wait! Hold on! You really need to let me take a look at that. I'm fine. The bullet went right through. - Hauser... - Have you ever been shot? - No, but I know... - What are we up against? Three men, at least one of them's a '63. Then we should assume they all are. All of them back together? What does that mean? You know what? Doesn't matter. They have Doc. No, don't. You're not hearing me. They have Doc. They could have killed him in the cell house. They didn't. That means there's a good chance that he's alive, but if you go in there with your guns blazing... They will kill him. What's the plan? We have them on video surveillance. Facial recognition will I.D. them. We need to know what they're doing here. Then we can work out how to go after them. Okay, Doc, I found it. The manual says the doors were modified with a safety release mechanism at the top of the sliding door. Chet, remind me to give you a raise. Because of you, my brother's dead! Wait! Stop, Pinky! Bolt cutters. Pick a hand. I said, "wait"! If he's with them, we can use him as bait. Get the little blondie to come to us, clear the way to the tunnels. That door your friends escaped behind... Does it connect with the dungeons? How many people are down there? A dozen. Maybe more. Your only chance is to run. If that were true, we'd already be dead. Stand up. There's no box for officer Donovan, but I have gone through the boxes of Edward "Pinky" Ames and his brother Herman. Now, the files indicate that they were famous for pulling high risk, high reward bank jobs, including coming close to robbing the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago. Hauser? I'll stop. Other than that, there's nothing in these boxes that say why they're with a guard or what the hell they're doing here. At least nothing I can see. Listen. You said they hit a Federal Reserve Bank? Yeah, why? The 12 banks in the Federal Reserve hold a majority of the country's gold. I think I know what the brothers are doing back here. What? Same thing they were doing 50 years ago when they got caught in the tunnels. They're looking for gold. From the Civil War? I read that in Doc's book, but I thought it was an urban legend. It is, isn't it? My God. To the little blonde who killed my brother, I'm about to return the favor. You have three minutes to deliver yourself before I start delivering your friend... Piece... by... piece. All right, that's it. Let's go. No. Wait. It's two against one. Yeah, but only one of them wants me dead. The other one just wants gold. I can split them. But by using yourself as bait? Yeah, and making sure Donovan brings Doc directly to you. Hauser... Are you up for this? No problem. This is it, pally. These keys don't fit. They're padlocks. Remember? Hey, we need to get back to the hole, now. I have to hand it to you boys. Most men draw plans of relative pencil-sketched simplicity. But you two? You dipped your pens into the inkwell of daring and creativity. Only one problem. You stole the wrong keys. This one opens the door you're standing in front of. You never let these two keys out of your sight. Everyone knows that. If they don't open the door to the gold, what on Earth do they open? None of your damn business. Mr. Tiller, take our two gophers back to the hole. Let's go. Come on. Let's go! By the way... You two owe me a spoon. Congratulations, officer. You just stopped one of Alcatraz's most daring escape attempts. Escape? Sir, it's obvious they were only interested in getting behind that door. You're mistaken, son. To avoid any further misunderstanding, I'm going to make sure you receive a commendation worthy of your efforts here today, something that will put you in the history books. Unless you have further questions? No, sir. No questions. Excellent. Why don't you join me for dinner in my private quarters? I'm in. Warden James. He invited me to his residence. He trusts you? Do you? You're my brother. Do you trust me? Then you hang in there. I'm gonna find out what they're doing to you. You okay, Doc? All right, listen up. We know where the gold is. My partner will open the dungeon for you, but only if you let him go. Behind you! I'll do it. I'll do it. You are so dead. No, no, no, no, no, no. Pinky, Pinky. It's what she wants. Wait. Wait. Let's go. Let's go! Come on. Open it. I don't have a key. I-I mean, I have one, but it's inside. Then I suggest you knock. Please... Mr. Hauser. Come on in. You know, you left your gun back there. I'll tell you what. I won't use mine either. That way, we'll get to spend more time together. Stop! Officer... Officer... Come out, come out... Wherever you are. Pinky! Move it. Where is he? Where's the old man? ... There's a back exit in the file room. - I guess he took off. - Which way? Which way? Go, go. Look, the guy's middle management. I mean, he's scared of his own shadow. Shut up. Which way? This'll take you to the dungeon. I'll stay here. I won't tell a soul. You won't tell a soul. Promise? My God. Doc! Doc, come on. Come on, Doc. Please, no yelling. Okay, all right, okay. Doc, where's Hauser? I have no idea. Donovan walked me down here. Place was empty. No Hauser. Then he slammed me in the window and took off down the tunnels. It's all right. Hey, Doc... Thanks for saving my life tonight. What are partners for? Okay. That'll be enough of that. Where'd you come from? Just curious where you thought it was. I know where it is. Behind that door. Tell you what. Split it with you, 50/50. You really don't strike me as a man of your word. Don't! Hauser. Hauser. What are you waiting for? No! Drop it. This... This place. This is the place! This is the place! I know. I have had a really bad night, so I am not gonna tell you again. Drop it! A Hmong tribesman I watched die in the jungles of Laos told me a story... About a giant eagle who agrees to fly two men to a moon made of gold. The men get greedy, one kills the other, and then the eagle eats the survivor in disgust. All Hmong fables are about the futility of being human. I know about the keys. What I didn't know is that they belonged to the warden. If you're gonna wiggle, it's gonna hurt. Which brings me to some questions. And I'm hoping you'll answer. There, see? Why was everyone so interested in Tommy Madsen? The guard, Ray Archer, what did he know? And Warden James. Has he come back? Is he the one that's willing to kill for these keys? Take your time. Hello, ladies. Don Felipe. Don Felipe. - Raiders, cutting out the cattle. - It's the Marlows. - Where are the vaqueros? - Driving the other herd to town. They are rushing them toward the Trinity. Old Felipe Robles raises nice stock. Won't do him no good. How is he going to pay us the money he owes us if we keep topping off his herd? I don't buy mortgages to get paid back. I buy them to foreclose. The black soil of Dallas County will make us rich. We'll bleed that old buzzard broke, huh, Cullen? The way I say. There'll be no killing here. Things won't be like they were in Georgia. - We didn't do so bad in Georgia. - Thanks to me. Any sniping here, I'll bust your trigger finger. And that's for you, too, Bryant. You're too quick on the draw. That doesn't do my business any good. So stay out of Dallas, understand? Any visiting to do, I'll do it. You boys hightail it. I'll take care of them. Raiders cutting out your cattle, Mr. Robles. I tried to stop them. They're your men, Will Marlow. My men? You aren't blaming me for all the war-bred scum in Texas? Isn't my fault Texas isn't back in the Union. And there'll be lawlessness until she is. The Marlow brothers and trouble came here together. I'm still willing to buy your land and take my chances against the raids. There would be no raids if you owned the Hacienda del Norte. Luis. Will just got through telling you not to do stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. Said to stay out of Dallas, too but I don't aim to. Brave, strong just like lizards in dark corners. But your day of looting is almost done. A marshal of the United States is on his way. Be into Springfield, Missouri in about 10 minutes. Folks traveling west or south change coaches. Yankee marshal? United States Marshal. United States? - All who thinks we're united, say, "Aye." - Aye. I'm inviting a lady carpetbag to set betwixt her own breed. With pleasure. Cold as a witch's broomstick. L... I'm... I'm Butterfield, Saint Louis. Dry goods, ladies' hose, and notions. I'm Martin Weatherby, Boston. - Stopping in Springfield? - Momentarily. - I have business with a William Hickok. - Wild Bill? - Greatest marshal ever lived. - Yeah, I hear Bill's retiring. - Ain't got no competition left. - You say. I saw he's scared he'll meet up with Reb Hollister. - That desperado? - Desperado, you say? Patriot, say I. Maybe Lee surrendered, but not old Georgia Reb. No, sir. He's a one-man war, still marching on. Stage for the West leaves in 30 minutes. Them that want vittles better hurry. Great day in the morning. It is pleasant. There he is, boy. The pride of Vicksburg. The terror of Kansas. That's Blayde Hollister. You mean to say that a common outlaw can walk the streets like that? - Is there no law enforcement here? - There's the law, Wild Bill Hickok. - Hickok, I have a letter to present to you... - Duck. Spoiled the party for you boys. I guess that settles who's running this town. I'll take that. Mister, bring his horse. - Nice shooting, marshal. - Yes, sir. Shot him dead. Well, if he ain't, we'll put the hemp to him. Here. Take your carrion out of town. - Well, go on. Don't stand there gawking. - Just a minute. - I had nothing to do with this. - Get going. - We heard you give that rebel yell. - You're quite mistaken. - I have a letter of introduction... - Boys, you wanted a hanging party here's a warm one for you. - Good riddance. - Just maybe the town will settle down now. Ruined my Sunday go-to-meeting hat. Keep going, blue-belly, or I'll fry you for breakfast. This may not be my official district but you've fallen into the hands of a United States Marshal. You like your bacon lean or fat? As soon as I've eaten, I intend to take you back to Springfield, to the authorities. - What's the matter? - Like Hickok said: Duck. Thieving varmint. That a way to return a favor? Stealing my hat? You dang blasted showoff, you cost me my best six-shooter. Now, hold on, Reb. I wouldn't stoop to such dirty doings, carting off your relics advertising I shot them off Reb Hollister. Now, where's my hat? Well, I tell you, Bill, there's a little boy I know who'd be mighty proud to have Wild Bill Hickok's hat. Well, now. That's a real nice thought, Reb. - Want me to autograph it for the kid? - Your initials are in it. That's good enough. - Have some vittles. - No. I gotta be getting back to town. - The fight look convincing? - Whole town ate it up. - You're dead as a doornail. - You sure untied my hands, Bill. It'll make life a lot easier for me, Reb Hollister being dead. - Aren't you going to arrest him? - Oh, forgot about you. I'm sorry I had to tin-can you, mister. I had to move Reb out of town before those yahoos found out we was just play-acting. Besides, I was afraid that getup you're wearing might start more shooting. - Preposterous. - It sure is. I'm speaking of your dereliction of duty. I'm informed... You're informed? And who or what might you be? - My name is Weatherby, Boston. - He's a United States Marshal. - It ain't possible. - On the contrary, I have a... - Hit something. - Wh...? What for? Well, Bill's a man that needs convincing. Marshal, I'm glad I met you while you were still with us. You're gonna be the shortest-lived marshal on record. As I tried to explain this afternoon, I have a letter from the Attorney General. You're to accompany me to Dallas County, in Texas. Brigands are terrorizing the district. - Brothers. - What's their name? Is it the Marlow brothers? Well, yes. Yes, that's it. Evidently, a poetic family. There's a Bryant Marlow, a William Marlow, and a Longfellow. - Cullen? - Yes, that's it. You know them? I've never seen them. These are orders, Hickok. Your patriotic duty demands... Sonny, there are duty scars all over my hide. From now on, folks are gonna buy tickets just to look at them on the stage of a theater. You mean you're going to be an actor? Why not? You're what marshaling has petered down to. Folks will be glad to pay to see the genuine, hairy specimen. Happy hunting, marshal. The law is in your purty hand. Marshal, this... This outlaw. If you don't arrest him, I shall. Outlaw? Let me tell you something, son. This ain't Boston. We had a war down here. You'll find men in high office who are thieves, cutthroats. You'll find others who are branded outlaws that are only fighting for what's their own. There's those known as bad men and those as are bad men. You better learn to tell the difference. - Hey, where are you going? - With you. What, to Dallas? Well, Hickok's out of circulation, ain't he? You mean that you'd take Mr. Hickok's place? - Why not? - Why, I don't know you, Mr. Hollister. You're branded as an outlaw, a Southern guerrilla. Though I can see merit in what Mr. Hickok says. Heaven knows you're more capable than I, but... - Oh, to make you my deputy. - You still haven't got the hang of it. I beg your pardon? I'm not gonna be your deputy. You're gonna be mine. You're not known in Dallas. Neither am I. So I'll be Marshal Weatherby. Nothing new in that idea. A regular custom up north, I understand. Hiring other people to do your fighting for you. I was at Chickamauga, Mr. Hollister. My brother was at Gettysburg. Well, you're something brand-new in carpetbaggers. Well, anyway, you can forget about the Marlows. One of them, anyway. You just swear me in, and I'll kill off Bryant for you all in the name of the United States government. There's to be no bloodshed. I merely want them apprehended. - Apprehended? Bryant Marlow? - Yes. You remember that little boy I was telling Wild Bill about? You're him, bub. Boston bean. I look like a Yankee cod, but I hope I don't smell like one. Might be an improvement over a Johnny Reb. Take it easy, blue-belly. You're lucky I stomached you this far. But that's the way it's got to be. You're me, but I'm not you. And... And when you're talking to me, you're talking to yourself. When I'm speaking to you it's not me I'm speaking to, it's... It's you. Well, anyhow, you get the idea. Anyway, I hope I can pass for a railroading Weatherby. You look that part more than I look like Bill Hickok's downfall. Only a Yankee tailor would outfit a feller this way to ride across Texas. I may as well tell you, I got into this only to impress my fiancée. Well, you can write back to Boston and tell her all about it. - She lives here. - Why? She only came to Boston to visit me. Her name is Antonia Robles. She's very lovely. - You ain't all Boston. - What do you mean by that? Codfish ain't known for warm blood. I haven't met her family yet. They're in cattle. It seems they're involved in a land war, so to speak harassed by those Marlow ruffians. Keep your hand off that gun. We're looking for the Robles' place. - Robles? - Where is it? I'm the new marshal. You are there. Follow me, senores. Don Felipe. - This isn't the reception I'd expected. - You are strangers. I hope Tonia's more pleased to see me than her father. - Now, wait a minute... - Antonia? Then you... You are Martin? Do forgive me. You would be welcome under any circumstances. But coming as you do, the marshal of the United States. Antonia has told us so much. I beg your forgiveness, and welcome to Hacienda del Norte. Let me present my son, Luis. Luis. I apologize for my son. It was nortenos, men from the North, that crippled him. Oh, I understand how he feels about nortenos, as you call them. We call them carpetbaggers. Oh, I forgot. Don Felipe, my brother, Daniel Weatherby. - Daniel? - From the lion's den. Father was a great Bible student. - How do you do? - Antonia made no mention of your brother. Well, I didn't tell her about him, black sheep of the family. Father kept him hidden. - Martin. - Tonia. Tonia. - Tonia, dear Tonia. - Martin. No, no, no. Leave them alone un momento together. You are Tonia, aren't you? - Who are you? - Well, I'm not Martin. I know that. But on the other hand, I am Martin. Martin's my brother. Hey, Daniel. Come in here. Oh, Tonia, darling. Martin, why have you brought this crazy one with you? Oh, Senorita Robles, Mr. Hollister. You overdid that, Reb. You didn't have to be so convincing. I had to hush her up. - Martin, answer me. Why is he here? - To ensure success against the Marlows. He's my deputy. Or rather, I seem to be his. Whatever he is, he needs a tight rein. He needs a drink. It's hard to explain, but it's important that he be known here as Martin Weatherby. No one except you must know who he is. He has enemies. This I can understand. For your information, I'll soon have fewer. My interest in these parts is the Marlow brothers. My family must be told who you are. They can be trusted. That gringo-loving brother of yours? Don't mislead yourself, young lady. No gringo could be his friend. Tonia, you must trust him. He's come here to help us. It won't be too long a hardship, senorita. I promise. I never expected a deputy fiancé. Martin was right. You are very lovely. And so is the Hacienda del Norte. Good green land fit for cotton. Got a nice, easy roll to it like... Like your home? I have no home. You are Martin's friend. This is your home. Well, let's apprehend them. Never launch an attack, Yankee, until you know the tactical situation. You learn that at Vicksburg, rebel? Foreigner. I'll make it simple so you can understand. The best place to reconnoiter is where the barleycorn flows. I'm raring. I can lick any man in the place. - Howdy. What's your undoing, gents? - Straight Kentucky. I never drink before 5. Set that glass right-side up. - Why? - Like I told you, turn it over. By Godfrey, another one wanting to lick every man in town. - I said nothing of the sort. - You turned your glass upside down. - Let me cool this one. - Wait, Dan. Don't draw. That hat my brother's wearing, he shot it off of Bill Hickok. Yes, sir. There's Wild Bill's initials right in the sweatband. Dirty Dan here, he sure cut the map of Kansas through the old buffalo's hair. - Sure enough? That don't give him no call to be so overbearing. Bear with him, boys. A thing like that goes to a young fellow's head. Set them up, bartender. The drinks are on me. - My name's Weatherby. - Weatherby? You're the new marshal. Say, been expecting you. New marshal's here. New marshal's here. New marshal's here. Hey, folks. New marshal's here. What'd you say your name was, marshal? Weatherby. Why? Seems to me I've seen you before. You haven't. Coulter's my name, Bar W Ranch. Welcome, marshal. Welcome. I'm Judge Harper of the federal district. You haul in the culprits, marshal. He'll jail them. When the evidence warrants it, Mr. Walters. Evidence? Why, everybody knows the Marlow boys are back of all this plundering. Nobody's seen them breaking the law. Particular, aren't you? Dallas will be run by federal law, not by mob rule. We're not wild Westerners. We're facing east, and that's our future. We intend to build industries here and culture. Dallas will raise people, not cows. If your carpetbag riffraff doesn't choke her to death in her cradle. This seems a matter for community action. Back home, when faced with any problem we had a town meeting. I suggest we call one. Where's your town hall? - Yes, every town should have a town hall. - We ain't got around to building one yet. Well, I'll speak to Will Marlow about it. Your judge here seems to think he's a model citizen. If you're gonna fool around over there, you better take Dirty here with you. Yeah. He ought to be marshal. He sure ought to. I told you to keep your mud tracks out of Dallas. Now you're here, and you even dragged these pack rats in. It gets lonesome out there in the barrancas. Then go buy yourself a bottle. I never worried about your not having something to keep you company. Which one of you is Bryant Marlow? - Who are you? - My name's Weatherby. Marshal. I told you I'm not interested in buying any property right now. You can take your deal somewheres else. Don't bother me. I'm Will Marlow. Sit down, marshal. You ain't trailing my worthless brother, are you, marshal? I didn't say that. I'm in the market for some real estate. I thought I might be accommodating the new marshal with a dwelling. I even heard they might send Bill Hickok down here. Bill? Oh, he's fired his last shot for the law. He got drilled? Fought it out with a fellow named Hollister. Hol...? Where is he? Hickok? He's retired. He's on his way east to do some play-acting. No, Hollister, Reb Hollister. Where is he? - Oh, he's dead. - Come on, we'd better get out of here. - You sure? - Hickok had it all his own way. I just happened to be there when Hollister was laid out cold. This calls for a bottle of bonded. We owe Wild Bill a drink. Well, my call isn't social. I wanna buy a building for a town hall. I suppose you know a valid deed when you see one. Marshal, you don't need to worry where Will Marlow and legalities are concerned. Well, here's 500 on account. I'll post the balance of 10,000 at the bank to be delivered by me when you produce a deed. Ten thousand? - Ten thousand? - That's a big bundle. You happen to know of a good ready-made hall? Yep. Know one would make a dandy. If I was to manipulate Bill Walters' head in front of that top O in "saloon" could you let air in it? - Ain't nobody could make a shot like that. - Especially not from here. Bill Walters got some horses I been wanting to trade for. You know, I never expected to find a marshal with so much civic spirit. Been to Georgia lately, Mr. Marlow? I've never been in Georgia. - You have, Bryant. - That ain't Bryant. Meet Jason Trask, my handy boy. - Well, here's to Bill Hickok. - Here's to all good marshals. You're doing your duty when you hunt the likes of my brother Bryant. You know, Mr. Weatherby here's likely to be the ruination of your job, Jason. Honest citizens don't need a bodyguard when there's a marshal around, fit to keep the law. Looks like one of them longhorns got Bill Walters. Poor old Bill. You know, I've knowed a lot worse skunks. Odd happenstance. Walters' place would make a fine town hall. - Yeah. - Who asked you? - Gun's still warm. - What gu...? Don't cock that hammer, you crazy coot. Why not? Works good this way. What's your name? It's still cocked. We're riding out. Coming? Have you got no brains? Shooting from this office, smearing your filth on me. Get out, you and your scum. Take the back stairs, and don't come back. - What happened up there? - I just spent 10,000 of your money. Cullen, get that dude! Keep a keen eye, Dirty. You did this to Cullen. You're tempting me, Bryant, every second you're in my sight. Come out of there, all of you, with your fingers in your ears! Wired trigger. Bryant Marlow's gun. I should've known that. My own brother Bryant he's been a cloud on me everywhere I tried to go. Looks like an honest man hasn't got a chance. I tried to hold him for you, marshal but he led Cullen wrong and got him killed. You done right marshal. You only followed duty. I'll help Dallas to set the noose around him. I'll give a reward for his capture. I'll pay my tithes to set this county free. - Marshal. - Quiet. Don't let them know I'm shot. Get the horses. Gotta get out of town without advertising it. Should've taken you straight to a doctor. That's how you lost Bull Run, Yankee: Letting the enemy know your casualty. He's right. It's best the Marlows detect no weaknesses. Don't worry. We are good doctors here. We had to be. What a brave one. The valiente who was to remove the Marlows. You had your chance at Will. Why didn't you shoot first and ask questions afterwards? - Or is it that you're afraid? - Luis. - Go from this room. - Let the little scorpion stay. He's right. I was afraid. Afraid I'd die and leave Bryant Marlow alive. I can't die, not until he's dead. I'd give much to be able to believe you. - My brother wasn't always like that. - He has a nasty bite. Don't blame him. You'd be bitter, too, if you were in his place. Amelia, the iron. Martin. Let's face it, Tonia Boston was one place but this is another. - Are you sorry you came? - No, I didn't say that. But every day I realize more that I've walked into a world of which I know nothing. - Could go back to your world, Martin. - And admit I'm licked? How long would I keep your love then? I came here to take care of you and I'll do it. Martin. That's for trying. But learning to shoot like Mr. Hickok won't help if you get sunstroke. Here. Duck! Here comes Will. Welcome, brother. You can take over now. I've had me a bellyful of this coyote music and I ain't just a bird cooing. You'll stay here and like it. That marshal's after you so you pull a murder for an introduction. Harper says your gun's evidence enough to hang you. And I had to do plenty fast-talking to keep myself out of your mess. You and your talking. If you'd done it my way, we'd be living in the Robles' hacienda by now. Hacienda, he says. space helmet. - Hello there. - Hi Daddy. - Hi, Mr. Donavan. - Bill. You two kids don't have this car in shape by now. I don't think you ever will. Uh, like talk some more about that marriage business. Better catch me while I'm in a good mood. Oh, daddy. We got something to tell you. - Oh you haven't run off... - No that we haven't done. We had decided wait. Not five years. Gonna least I finished my hitch in the service. That's a wise decision, Bill. Yes, indeed I think that's a very wise decision. How about some breakfast. - Good idea. - Let's go. Gary knows now, so you'll never forget it. Responsibilities are a privilege. An inherent American right. The strength of our nation, The bright hopes of a free world... are founded on the dedication of individual Americans. People who guarantee freedom. By standing ready to fight against aggression. Against the Communist attempts at world enslavement. Freedom is not hereditary It must be earned. Freedom has a price and it's price is vigilance. It's price is responsibility. Not only of government. But of every citizen who salutes our flag. Those who serve as a part of our nation's armed might. and those who have served. They guarantee freedoms continued existence. Freedom. No single word and all the languages of mankind. Has come to mean so much. Freedom to enjoy the simple things of life. In the circle of family and friends. Freedom to work at a vocation of our choosing. To vote an open election. For the candidate we believe best qualified. To come to go as we please. Freedom owned property. To enjoy the priceless heritage of life, liberty. And the pursuit of happiness. To marry, raise a family. With belief in the dignity of the human spirit. To study in the field of our choice. To speak our beliefs, the worship God. These freedoms that spell America. They represent a way of life that has become the... farthest advancement of mankind on this planet. To prevent communism from consuming the entire free world. There stands but one man. That man is you. Subtitles: Kilo This is the beat of a human heart. Sit very still and listen. Is your heart beating in this same rhythm? You are experiencing the heartbeat of a dying man. And it is with death and dying that we concern ourselves. What happens at the point of death. What happens afterwards. What happens after death to someone who does not choose to... stay dead? Someone like... Morella. Whoa. Ma'am... I have to get back to Boston. Yes. Leave the trunk here, then. I'll have one of my father's servants carry it in. Yes, ma'am. Giddap. Is anyone there? Father? Father? Who are you? Father? - What? - It's Lenora, Father. You... are my father? Yes. What do you want here? Shocked? Disgusted? No. Are you all alone here? I was... until you came. - Father, I came to see you. - Now you've seen me. Are you content? That's all? That's all you have to say to me after 26 years of separation? - Father, I came all the way from... - I know. I know you don't love me, father, that you put me from your life, except for 21 years of board and tuition money. But I had hoped that we'd enjoy one brief visit together before I left your life entirely. I have no way of getting back to Boston at the moment. May I stay? Do as you wish. Morella, my beloved wife, your murderer has returned. Get away from her. Father, has she been lying here all these years? Do you hear me? - Why did you come here? - Don't touch me! I'm not a helpless baby this time. I'll go when I... when I choose. When I... Oh, my God! My God! Why did I come here? Why? - Try to understand. - Oh, I understand. No. You understand nothing. You understand nothing! When she died, I died with her. All that remained of me was this... this walking corpse, this shell, this ghost of flesh. She was my life. And... I killed her. - That's it, isn't it? - Yes! Oh, no. No. She thought you did. She said so on her deathbed. She was so young. So alive. To die just a few months after giving birth to you - she couldn't accept it. I hated you. Oh, dear God, how I hated you! I wanted to kill you. I went into your nursery and I took you out of your cradle and I almost hurled you out of the window! I wish you had. What? You're ill. I have a few months left to live. We're both dead now, Father. I'm sorry. In my 26th year, my father is finally concerned about me. Did you ever stop to wonder just once in all those 26 years: "Where is my daughter? What is she doing? Is she happy?" No. Why should you wonder that? After all, I'm only your child. - I'll be leaving very soon. - Lenora. - No! No! - Forgive me. Forgive me. - No. No. - Forgive me. How long have you been alone? I don't know, Lenora. Go on, please. What happened then? There's not much more to add. It came as no surprise to me that my marriage ended in failure. I'd failed before in my relationships with men, many times. Many times. I... cannot give, you see. Yes. How did she die, Father? How did she die? There was this party, and... I knew that she was too weak to withstand the strain of it. Yet she insisted. She had to have this party. She had to dress up in her finest gown and dance and sing. Less than an hour after the party had begun, she collapsed. I picked her up in my arms and I carried her up to her bedroom. I put her on her bed. Her face was white. Oh, dear God, how white! She was enraged, furious! Even dying, she was enraged. "It was the baby," she said. She swore she'd avenge herself. "It was the baby." She kept saying it over and over again. "It was the baby!" And then... before even the doctor could arrive, she was dead. Why did you not bury her? I did, but I could not leave her there. I could not. The thought of imprisoning her beauty in a box, of putting her underneath the ground... I was deranged, Lenora. Insane with grief. I only wanted to kill myself. I almost did kill myself, a dozen times. I'll never know what kept me from it. No, I... I could not bury her. And now? There's no reason not to do it now. Will you stay for a while? Please. I know it's too late to make amends, but perhaps together we could find some sort of an answer. Perhaps. - Then you'll stay? - If you really want me to. Yes. Then you've come home at last. At last! Help me! Go away... Leave me... Lenora, what is it? What can I do? - Lenora, what's wrong? - Let go... Lenora! Lenora! Oh, no! No! How I envy you. Sleep. Now you are released. Come back, Lenora. Come back. Lenora? Lenora? Morella! Oh, my God! Where's Lenora? What have you done to her? All these years I've waited to return. All these years I've waited to avenge myself. And what is it that happens just before death which leads inexorably to that death? Our second tale provides one roguish answer to that question in the story of a man who hated a cat: The Black Cat. Why don't you watch where I'm going? ♪ Who dat... knocking at the door? Montresor? Montresor? Come down here. And keep that beast away from me or I'll kick his head in! I want some money. There is none, Montresor. "There is none, Montresor." Always lying, it's a fact. As if I wouldn't know you had more nest eggs than a chicken. Get away from me, you repulsive creature! And stay away from me! Where's my money? There is none, Montresor. All right. I'll find it. Oh! Montresor! If you don't give me the money, I have to find it myself. Oh. Oh, I know where it is. I know. If I ever catch you again, you mangy, insufferable brute, I'll... I'll... I'll tear your head off! By the root! Oh, you won't bite me. Give me my money! There is none, Montresor. You haven't worked in 17 years. Will you? Has it been that long? Oh, stop your silly tactics. What about your sewing money? - We need that for food. - Food! That's exactly what I want it for. I drink my food! Give me the money. Thank you for looking into your heart. We will starve now. That's all we have. You've got a lot of money hidden all around the whole house. I know that. He was so romantic... once. I said get out! And stay out! You pig, you. You... you dog! How dare you throw me out! If only I had a pistol. If I had a pistol, I'd... I'd probably sell it and buy myself more wine. Oh, but really... After all I've done for her, she should have given me more money. There's just no gratitude. Sir, would you help a veteran of the Revolutionary War? Out of my way! Pardon me, ladies, but could you spare a coin for a moral cripple? Disgraceful! Do you have some money for a dying man? Go sleep it off. No gratitude. Hey. I want money! - Scum! - You dirty money-grubber. Just no gratitude. No kindness. Top of the morning, everybody! My, what a nice bunch of gentlemen! Look.Look. Beautiful. One moment, please. Gentlemen. Quiet, everybody. As we promised before, a treat for everyone. A demonstration in expert wine tasting by none other than... Mr. Fortunato Luchresi himself. Bravo! Bravo! As you know, gentlemen, Mr. Luchresi is without doubt the foremost wine taster in the civilised world today. Huh? That's nonsense! I can tell the taste of any wine just as well as he can. Liar! If we may proceed... I said, I can tell the taste of any wine... just as well as anybody! Afraid to try me, huh? You coward! You poseur. I say call the police! One moment! Please. Sir, unless you are intent on mere rabble-rousing, you have just made a most grave and serious accusation. An accusation which I am prepared to follow up with action. That is, if you care to take the risk. We will take the risk. - Oh? - Oh, yes, yes. My name is Fortunato Luchresi, at your service. Montresor Herringbone! What are we waiting for? Bring on the wine. Bring on the wine. Pinot Noir, Burgundy, Clos de Vougeot. Vintage... 1838. - Quite passable. - Correct! Give me more. Don't be so stingy. Burgundy. Volnay, 1832. And... it's from the better slopes of the vineyard. It's... it's very good. Correct. I don't believe it. Mmm. Mmm... Bordeaux... Cabernet... Chateau Margaux. Vintage... 1837. A bit heavy for a Margaux. Correct! Mmm. Mmm! Château Petit-Village... 1828. It's very good. Correct. Well, I must say, you seem to know your wine, sir. I should, I should. However, I feel I must comment on your most unorthodox method of tasting. Huh? The accredited procedure is, of course, to partake of a small mouthful, like this, whoosh it around in the mouth like that, and then inhale like this, thus releasing the aroma... You do it your way and I do it my way. Châ... Château... Châ... teau... Savignon! It's very good. ♪ Who dat... who dat... - ♪ Who dat... who dat... - Please, sir. - ♪ Knocking at the door? - Please, sir. Please.

I want you to meet a friend of mine. A very good friend of mine. The best friend I ever had in the whole wide world. What was your name, friend? Luchresi. Fortunato Luchresi at your service, ma'am. I am Annabel Herringbone. I was just trying to help my friend home. He had too much to drink! Asseyez-vous, Sam. No, really, I must be going. Asseyez-vous, Sam. Thank you. Come on and sit down, friend. Siddown! - You... you live in the city, Mr. Luchresi? - Yes. Yes, I do, Mrs. Herringbone. My, what a lovely cat! Well! - You like cats? - Oh, I adore them, yes. I have several of my own at home. He's... resting. Yes, he's... resting. Oh. I think he's ill. Oh. I tell you this: With women... with women you have to assert yourself. Take my case, for instance. I tell my wife to give me some money. I want to go out for the evening. Well, sir, it used to be that she gave me trouble. Argued with me and tried to withhold what was rightfully mine. But now she just gives me all the money I ask for, and I can stay away the entire night doing exactly as I please - which happens to be drinking. - Since when? - Since when? Huh? Seems to me... since that day I went to that wine sellers convention and met... And he assisted me home and I... I introduced him to my wife. - Good night, my treasure. - Good night, beloved. Let me look at you again. Until tomorrow night, heart of my heart. Oh! Good evening, dear. You gave me such a start. - Why? - I didn't expect you home so early. You didn't? I thought it would be nice if I came home early and we spent some time together. But I see you've already gone to bed. Oh, yes. I... I was very tired. Exerting yourself? Exerting? I had a very strenuous day. And a more strenuous evening, I assume. I beg your pardon? - Isn't it a little too late to beg my pardon? - I... I don't know what you mean. You lie! You dirty, faithless little trollop, you! You lie! So you know. How long has this been going on? Long enough for me to realise that our marriage is a farce, a mockery! You can no longer wound me with your cruelty. I have found, at long last, love. How touching. Mock me if you will, but this is the end. You and I are finished. I'm going to leave you and become Mrs. Fortunato Luchresi! You are? Congratulations. Good afternoon, Mr. Herringbone! - How very nice to see you again. - And how nice to see you again! - And how well you look. - Thank you, sir. And yourself as well. - Thank you. Come in. - Thank you. - After you, sir. - Oh, thank you. And how nice of you and Mrs., uh... Mrs. Herringbone to invite me for dinner. Oh, we're enchanted to have you, sir. Most delighted, I assure you. - Please. - Thank you. Ah, the cat! The cat. What a charming fellow he is! - Yes, isn't he? - Yes. And is Mrs. Herringbone about? Oh, yes. She's very, very busy preparing our dinner. - May I offer you some sherry? - Oh, I'm delighted, sir. Delighted! - Amontillado? - That's correct, sir. Ah, but what an amontillado! A wine to conjure memories of taste buds in transport. I'm terribly happy you like it, sir. To your health. - And to yours, sir. - Thank you, sir. - A draught from paradise. - That it is, that it is. Let me fill your glass. Look, mine is always empty. - Well, I cannot resist. - That I've noticed. - I beg your pardon? - No, nothing, nothing. To your long life. And to your long life, sir. Right now I have a better chance than you have. - You spoke, sir? - No, no. Nothing. - Let me fill up your glass. - Well, just a bit more. Where did you get this...- pardon me - this excellent wine? Oh, I've had that in my cellar for a long, long time. - Indeed? - Saving it for a very special occasion. - Oh, today? - Yes, sir. - What occasion? Surely not my presence. - That's part of it. And what is the other part? Your death. What are you doing? What are you doing? I'll give you three guesses. - Surely you can't mean to? - Wall you in, yes. - But why? - Ask your treasure, your heart of hearts. - What? - Ask Annabel! Annabel? I... Ann... a... bel? You... you killed her. You notice everything, don't you? Help! Please, let me go. Help! Don't make so much noise. I don't like it. - You're insane! - That may be, but... very clever. The way I put that drug in your amontillado with the consummate skill of a Borgia. And this whole arrangement. - They'll never find you behind this wall. - You can't mean it. You can't mean it! Haven't I convinced you of my sincerity yet? I'm genuinely dedicated to your destruction. Help! Help! Help! What kind of a man are you, anyway? Make love to my wife and doesn't even talk to me! It's an excellent jest, sir. We'll have many a good laugh about it in the future. I Will. I Will. God... For the love of God, Montresor... Yes. For the love of God. Nice professional job. She must have it hidden somewhere. Eureka! Everybody back to the counter! Montresor is buying again! Gentlemen, let's have a toast, huh? To my precious wife, without whose money this most splendid evening would be impossible. Where she is now, she won't need it anyway. ♪ Who dat knocking at the door? Is dat you, Sam? Argh! Argh! Aaargh! Give me back my head! Keep that cat from my head, will you? ! Keep that cat from... Give me back my head! Aaaaargh! Huh! Go away! I said... go away! - Mr. Herringbone? - Yes. - We knocked, but no one answered. - The door was ajar, so we looked in. Then when we found the house in such a state... In such a state? Oh, yes. I... I remember I was searching for something last night. We thought there'd been some trouble, so we came right in. - Are you all right, sir? - I'm all right! We've received a report from a Mr. Wilkins. He's the bartender at the Red Lion Tavern. You know Mr. Wilkins. Claims you spent a rather large amount of money last evening. Well, it's my own money. Can't I spend my own money? Further, that you said that your wife wouldn't need the money where she is. Might I ask, sir, where your wife is? She's gone. She left with her lover. I don't know where she is, nor do I care. Are you ill, sir? No, I... No. You don't happen to have a little whisky on you, boys, huh? No, sir. You see, I've had hallucinations lately. Been drinking a little bit too much last night. I see. Do you mind, sir, if we search the premises? No. Where do you want to start? I think... the cellar. The cellar. Oh. Are you coming down, Montresor? - Did you hear anything? - No. - No. - I didn't think so. Well, here we go, gentlemen. Yes. Come on down. I... I think I'll drink a little less in the future. Now he decides. - Shut up. - What? Nothing, nothing. I just keep mumbling. I had too much to drink. - We had better make a thorough search. - Search? Don't you find everything all right and in order? Go ahead, search everything you want. I don't care. Montresor! What a thing to say. Naughty, naughty, Montresor. Keep quiet! Whoo-ooh! Whoo-ooh! Right behind here, Mr. Policeman. We're right behind the wall! Right behind it. Are you blind, Mr. Policeman? Whoo-ooh! You're not paying attention. You're getting cold. This way. Now are you satisfied? What do you think? I buried them down here? That's exactly what he did. Exactly! Where would I have hidden them? Under this floor? Or... or maybe in that wall, huh? Look! Look how solid it is! Look at it! Look! What in the name of God? - You can hear it too? - Hear it? What's behind there? Nothing. Nothing at all. Well, we'll see. What exactly is it that occurs at the moment of death? Especially to a man who, in that moment, is not permitted to die. As in the case of Mr. Valdemar. There is no pain. No... Dairy. You are at peace, mind and body at peace entirely. Yes. Then listen to the sound of my voice. Carefully. Pain vanished. Mind and body in a state of peace. You understand this, Valdemar? I... under... stand. Then sleep. Sleep. Sleep. When my hand passes across your face, waken. - Are you all right? - Perfectly, my dear. - The pain, it's gone? - Vanished! What is your finding, Doctor? - Well, you seem to be in good condition. - Seem to be? But I am! Oh, come now. Admit the truth of it: Mesmerism works! It works. I've never doubted that it works, sir. Only its advisability in certain cases. It would certainly seem to be advisable in the case of Mr. Valdemar. Or would you have me suffer untold agonies of pain in order to observe strict medical protocol? - Ernest! - My sweet Helene. Forgive me, both of you, for my most untimely sense of humour. But this is a joyous moment. Smile! Come. Let us drink. Let us drink to mesmerism, the ministration of the gods. I'm sorry, I can't drink to that. Then drink to the health of my beautiful wife. - To the very good health of you both. - And to Mr. Carmichael. Sir. How blessed to be free of pain. For that part, sir, I am truly happy. Please believe me. It's for the other aspect of mesmeric influence that I feel concerned. - Which is, Doctor? - Perilous toying with the human mind. But, my dear Dr. James, what is perilous about it? Mr. Valdemar has received nothing but advantage from its applications. And, as we all know, he is dying of an incurable disease. - I wish you'd stop refer... - Helene, Helene. The issue must be acknowledged. Within this skull - as well you know, Doctor - there is tissue which is dying even as I speak. I am physically doomed. I do not say this out of bitterness or despair. However, there is one favour I would ask: To escape a pitiful and painful decline to death through the auspices of Mr. Carmichael. - Would you deny him this, Doctor? - No, sir. And yet, you know, he will accept nothing for this blessing, save some trifling favour on my deathbed. - Sir? - Favour, Ernest? I should not even have mentioned it. It's so slight. No, please. I want to know. Well, my dear, it's simply... You tell them, sir. You can explain it so much better than I. Mr. Valdemar has consented to be mesmerised in articulo mortis. - Which is to say... - At the point of death. I fear it sounds more dreadful than it really is. What does it mean? Ernest, why? To ascertain just how long the actual moment of death can be forestalled. A momentous experiment. Momentous? Monstrous would be more the word! Sir, I appeal to you, withdraw this offer. The deathbed is no place for lunatic experiments. My dear young friend, what can it matter whether I die 10 or 20 minutes beyond that point when I shall die at any rate? What could be less important? I owe this gentleman a great deal. A great deal. I could not dream of refusing him such an insignificant request. As you say, sir. - I fear I must leave now. - So soon? I am sorry. Good night, Doctor. Thank you for attending me. My dear, show our friend to the door, will you? Yes, of course. A bit more wine, Mr. Carmichael? Hm? Oh! Thank you. Elliot, this experiment... Do everything in your power to dissuade him from it, Helene. I've no proof that it's dangerous, no proof whatever. I only sense that it might be. What is it, Elliot? Why is it that since that man entered our life I can't think, I'm uncertain... Oh, he helps Ernest. I can't argue with that. He seems to relieve him of all pain. To see him suffer is more than I can stand. - But at the same time... - You distrust Carmichael? Yes, I do. Still, it's true that he asks for nothing. Perhaps he asks for nothing because he desires everything - including you. You can't be serious. - You haven't seen him looking at you? - Yes, but... Of course I've no right to say this, really, for I too look at you. Elliot, please. You know how I feel. I love my husband and respect him. - No more than I do. - I know that. So let us think of nothing else but Ernest and our respect for him. - Good night, Helene. - Good night. Ernest. Hm? Oh. Yes, my dear? Won't you reconsider? - Regarding the experiment? - I fear him. Fear Carmichael? But, my dear, think of the pain he has spared me. If only you could see the change in him when you're under his control, Ernest. All the fawning ceases. He no longer calls you Mr. Valdemar. It's just Valdemar. - He tells you what to do, what to think. - Please, my dear. No more. Let us forget it. It is established and of no importance. What is important is you. I wish with all my heart that following my death you would marry our good Dr. James. No, no, no. Please, my dear. Let me finish. I know that there is a bond between you. All honourable. I know that too, and I love you both for it. But I... I am going to die soon, Helene, and it would make me very happy to know that you would not be alone, that you would marry again. Oh, my dear. Your happiness means more to me than anything. Anything! But I refuse to die until that happiness has been assured. It... it approaches, does it not? No pretence, please. It approaches. No, my dear. No sorrow. I... I am content, believe me. Have you informed Mr. Carmichael, as I requested? - He is below, sir. - Then fetch him, if you will. Quickly. Go quickly. Have a care, sir. So... the time has come, Mr. Carmichael. It will be to you, sir, I promise, no more than sinking into a dreamless sleep. Best hurry, Mr. Carmichael. Now, no despair, I implore you. It is peace I go to. Freedom from this ghastly pain. Your hand, Doctor. I charge you this... upon your soul: Watch over my Helene. - Swear to it? - I swear to it. Rest easily, sir. I do now. With all my heart I thank you... for having added to my life one great, sweet measure of devotion. No... You may proceed, Mr. Carmichael. Look at the turning wheel, at the changing of the colours, and sleep. Deep... deep sleep. Your body losing all sensation. Your mind enveloped in darkness. Nothing can disturb you now as you drift ever deeper into darkness... and sleep. Sleep... Sleep... Valdemar. Do you hear me? It is my voice. I... hear. Are you asleep? I... am... asleep. Valdemar, raise your right arm. Lower it. Is there any pain? No... pain. I am... dying- Oh! Please... do not wake me. Let me... die. I will not wake you, Valdemar. Deep... deep sleep... from which there is no waking... unless I say. - You understand, Valdemar? - I... understand. You may examine him now if you wish. Do you so fear me? I have but released your husband from his pain once more. - Would you have had me do otherwise? - No. - Then do I... personally offend you? - Please, Mr. Carmichael, not now. Valdemar, return to your sleep. Return to your sleep, Valdemar! - I command you! - Stop it! Valdemar. Do you hear me? Do you hear the sound of my voice? Are you asleep now? I... have been... asleep. But now... I am... dead. You are asleep, Valdemar. No. Yes, yes, yes. You do but sleep. Raise your right arm. Raise it, Valdemar! I command you! Raise your right arm! He does not. He does not. He is dead. Yes, he is dead. But still aware. - Release him. - Release him? ! Valdemar, do you hear me? I hear. Tell me, where are you? Darkness. - Stop it! - That will do, Mr. Carmichael. Where, Valdemar? Where? Stop it! - End the control, Mr. Carmichael! - No! Valdemar, tell me what you see. - Your surroundings, what are they? - That will do! Are you insane? ! Do you not comprehend the import of what has happened? His body is dead, but his mind lives on, controlled by me! - Which control will now end! Let him die! - No! Be gone! Where am I? What place is this? I see only darkness. People. Multitudes of people. No... No-o-o-o! No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! Valdemar, be still. Help me. Be still, Valdemar. I will let you go when I am finished. Your whisky, sir. Leave it there. Get out! Valdemar. Valdemar, do you hear me? Be still. Be still! Release me. Release me. Give me peace. Be still! Release me. Let me go. I will release you when I am ready. - Good evening, Doctor. - Good evening. - Is Mr. Carmichael upstairs? - Yes, sir. Thank you. Come. I promise you an end to it, Helene. HOW? Come. Now, tell me this. Come in. - What can I do for you? - I'm here to order you, Mr. Carmichael... Not request, but order. You will end the mesmeric control immediately. - Will I, Doctor? - You will. And how do you propose to enforce that order? With this. - You wouldn't dare. - Do you choose to take that risk? If you kill me, Valdemar will remain in the same state indefinitely. - Perhaps for ever. - No! - I shall count to three, then I shall kill you. - Elliot! - You must be out of your mind. - One. - No. - Two. - Elliot, no! - Wait a minute. - I want you to hear something first. - Nothing from you, sir. Did I say it was from me? If you will, come with me. Valdemar. Tell them what you told me just now, about Helene. I do not wish for her to marry Dr. James. I wish for her to marry Mr. Carmichael. - No! - You heard him, madam. - You control him. His words are yours! - That is a lie! - Is it? - Yes! Elliot, please, you must leave now. - What? - I want you to go. - But that was not your husband speaking! - It was his voice. - But not his will! - I don't know that. - Helene, in the name of God! - Elliot, please go. There's nothing more to be said or done. I just want you to go now. Very well. But I shall be back. And God help you if you do her harm in any way. - Well, madam? - I believe Dr. James is quite correct. It is not my husband who would have me marry you. - You heard him with your own ears. - It was not him. However, I will make a bargain with you, Mr. Carmichael. I'll marry you... upon the stipulation that you set my husband free. I need make no bargains with you, madam. - What? - You will marry me in any case. No. Not unless you end his torment. Edicts, madam? Orders from you? Allow me to enlighten you. I am in command here. You will do as I say, or I will leave Mr. Valdemar exactly as he is and never, do you understand me, madam? , Never let him go. I've coveted you these many months, hungered for you. And now you shall be my wife. I shall take what I desire. - Your body and your soul, if I demand it! - I've heard enough! No! Stop it! Let me go! Let me go! You're hurting me! Help! Help me! Let me go! Help! Help me! No! Argh! Helene! Helene! Ugh! ripped by qwerzz Go, swim away! You're free now. The two snake spirits White snake is the elder, green snake is younger. They are always caring for and helping each other. It's so boring here as celestial beings. And so lonely too. Everyday just drags on. Everything remains the same here. To be joyful one should go to the mortal world. It's certainly warmer there. Seek fun in the mortal world. Romance is sweet in the world of humans. If you know the mortal world is fun, ...why not go there to live? I'd sure like to. But I fear the heavenly rules and punishments. Well, I've had enough here, I'll take my chances. I've decided to take a trip there. Please take care of our home. You treat me like your younger sister, we go through everything together. I will worry if you go alone. Of course I too would like to go with you. After Xu Xian paid his respects to his ancestors, ...he took his time on the way home. Gazing tirelessly West Lake's picture-perfect scenery. There, unexpectedly, he'd meet a beauty by the shore. Dear sister. He's neither kith nor kin, why are you so lost in thought over him? We have just got here to the mortal world, and you seem to be like, totally besotted! It's true that we don't know him, but... I remember him saving my life once perhaps eons ago. That's in his past life, of course you wouldn't know. Oh, so then he's your benefactor. I have to pay my debt of gratitude. I need to get to know him first, ...and I'll need your help. Hey, look. Boatman, would you go to Qingbo Gate? Yes. Hop on. Please come closer. Be careful. Boatman. Where are you heading to? We're going to Qingbo Gate. Could you take us? Of course, this master is going that way. Come on, you two. Watch out! It's slippery. Mister. My lady invites you to sit inside. There's no room. I don't want to cause you any inconvenience. Mister, since we are travelling together, there's no such thing as inconvenience. Please come in. - Come on. - Please stop pulling. It's fine. I'll come in. It's fine. Sure. Let me hold the umbrella. That's alright, thank you. Please sit down. Please. Just sit down, or my boat will rock over. May we know your name, mister? Xu Xian. So it's Mr. Xu. Yes. Sorry to bother you. Don't be so modest. Boatman. You can't take their money. I should pay. It's the same. Give her money back, I'll pay you. Let me pay... It's the same. You shouldn't have. You're most welcome. Qingqing. We ought to move on, looks like it might rain. Is that so? It's raining again. It's quite heavy, what should we do? Please take this umbrella, miss. We can't... what about you? It's fine, I live close by. Thank you. You're welcome. Let's go, it's getting heavier. Where do you live, mister? I'll return the umbrella to you tomorrow. Don't worry. I'll pick it up from your residence tomorrow. Good idea. Outside Qingbo Gate, there's Qianwang Temple. Beside it is a red door; with character "Bai" on it. That's my home. I'll pay you a visit tomorrow. Mister, you can get off too. Alright. Playing in the woods a thousand years ago, I was held hostage by a naughty child. Luckily my benefactor was there to help, ...or else I'd be beaten to death. I must repay this favour, I'd like to marry him. "Bai Residence" Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu, why are you leaving? My lady worried that you can't find us, she sent me here to welcome you. Please come inside. My lady has been expecting you. Please have a seat, Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu. Please sit down, Mr. Xu. After you, miss. Are you busy at work? Yes, I work in a shop. We're busy all the year round. The dishes are getting cold, I'll check in the kitchen. Please have another drink. Please. The wine's getting cold, I'll fill this up. Be seated, please. No, I can't drink too much. Don't worry, you won't get drunk. Sister. Should I send him off? Qingqing. I must remind you, although you're in love with Mr. Xu, and we've checked his background out. But still, you never know. I request you to think it over. Qingqing, I appreciate your concern. But about Mr. Xu, he's honest and sincere. There's not a lie coming from him, he's not like the others. If you love him that much, I'll talk to him. You're dashing and polite, young and good looking. Your wife must be very lucky, I'd say She's fortunate to have a husband like you. My parents died when I was very young, I work live at my brother-in-law's pharmacy. I'm not married yet, so how would there be a wife as you say? One should get married on coming of age. Say, even if not married you should be engaged. I have no assets and no abilities, ...how could I get engaged? Okay, so you're not engaged now, you don't plan to stay single forever, do you? No matter what, you don't have to worry about me. I don't think it's a good idea to be single. Let me be your matchmaker. There's a young spinster I know of; She's prettier than the fairies. Even if she is, she certainly won't marry a poor man, right? But this young lady that I speak of... she's marrying for love, not for money. To fall in love it's got to be predestined. Otherwise it won't work. If it's not meant to be, how could she fall in love at first sight? She'd have to meet me first, before she could fall in love. You've met her, and you've talked to her. Please don't pretend to be a fool. I've met and talked to her? Are you teasing me? Whom are you referring to? My lady Miss Bai Suzhen. I'm a junior worker in a pharmacy, I am no match for your lady. I'm from a poor family, I've no assets, ...how could I get married? Haven't I told you? She's not interested in betrothal money. There's no need to worry. I appreciate your kindness. I however, must talk to my elder sister and brother-in-law first. Then I'll give you an answer. What if your sister says no? She would of course consider. Wait a minute, I'll ask my lady to come here, ...and you can have a talk. Shoulder to shoulder, side by side. In a pair, under the full moon. Like a fish in the sea, husband and wife will be together forever. Very much in love, the couple is thrilled. The hills and the willow trees on the side, ...the little boat sails on. My dear wife... You're a rare gem, such a romantic. You are willing to marry a poor man like me. I'm ashamed that I haven't achieved my goals yet, I feel bad not being able to provide you a good life. We're husband and wife now, don't be so modest. I'm not marrying for money; As long as our love can last forever, ...I can live a simple and poor life. Even if you put vanity aside, one would still need money to live a simple life. My income is limited, I reckon it will be difficult for us. Don't worry, I have it all planned out. I have many relatives in Suzhou city. They'd all be willing to lend a helping hand. I've been practising medicine since I was young, ... I've been handed down a 'cure-all' prescription. Let's move to Suzhou. We'll open a clinic. Xu Xian bid his sister goodbye and moved away. "Baohe Clinic" Business at the new clinic is going well. Bai Suzhen is a good doctor. She can cure all. She can even cure all kinds of hopeless cases. One dose of her prescription will do the trick. Their reputation has spread far and wide. The clinic is often packed. "Luzu Temple" Incense sticks for sale... I'll burn incense sticks under my master's order. I'm passing by, and it happens to be Luzu's birthday. That's why I'm here to meet and greet new friends. Charms, amulets for sale. Guaranteed to keep off all troubles and evil spirits. Work like magic they do. My name is Guo Wei, I can summon wind and rain. I know how to ward off evil spirits. You are here to pay your respects to Luzu, don't miss the chance to buy my charms. Strange, I can feel some evil spirit. It's you to flush the spookiness around! Nonsense! We all know Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu and his wife are life-savers; Evil spirits? That's ridiculous. Everyone. What evil spirits? No one believes you. He indeed has evil force around him. And it's from someone close to him. What rubbish! Your wife is a monster. That's sheer nonsense. Tell me then, what kind of a monster is she? Speak up. Speak up. Where? Monster? If you can't tell, ...I'll wreck your booth. Wreck it! I couldn't say what kind of a monster she is, but I'm certain that she's the one. If you don't get rid of her, your life is in grave danger. Taoist priest, you are much older than me, I'll let you get away this time. I'd be a conman if I take your money. Now, I'm giving you three charms for free. Come here to thank me tomorrow. He makes sense. What if she isn't? If she isn't... What do you say? Wreck his booth. Fine! It's a deal. Alright. Alright. Here you go. Hide the first one in your hair, then the devil wouldn't hurt you. Place the second one above your door, then she couldn't escape. Burn the third one in front of her, and her true identity... will be revealed! What a silly Taoist priest. A third grade fortune-teller he is. I've been a snake spirit for a thousand years, do you think I'll be scared of your charms? But my husband is confused, I must try to lift his suspicion. I must solve this puzzle for him. Are you alright, dear? What do you want to tell me? I met a Taoist priest at Luzu Temple. He just kept insisting that you're a monster; Moreover, he has even given me 3 charms. This is ridiculous! Go on then, try it out! See if it works. What if it doesn't? If it doesn't, I'm going to wreck his booth tomorrow. Go on then, try it out! Go on. I'm worried that you couldn't handle it... So you believe what the Taoist priest said? You think that I'm some evil spirit. If I burn this you will... my true identity will be revealed. Dear, it's just a scam, You shouldn't listen to such gossip from now on. Especially not those conmen. I won't listen to such nonsense anymore. I'll go wreck his booth right now. Dear. Dear. Where do you think you're going, Taoist priest? Do you think you can bully people ...with your voodoo? Are you scared of me? Taoist priest. Miss Qing... Please spare me... Sister. Are you alright? Congratulations! What is it, dear? Dear. Should I congratulate you or myself? Congratulations! Mr. Xu... What is it? Miss Qing, where is Mr. Xu? What is it? There's a monk outside who wants to meet the master. A monk. What is it? There's a monk here to see you. Give him a donation and send him off. He's not here for money or for consultation. He wants to see you; Um... it seems rather important. What does he want from me? Strange. Do you know who that monk is? Monk Fahai of Golden Mountain Temple. Master, are you looking for me? You don't know me, but I know you are Xu Xian. Do you have advice for me, master? This is not such a good place to talk; There's an open space over the bridge, ...let's walk over there. Only my family's here, we can talk at ease. This is kinda private, we better talk over there. After you. Don't let anyone disturb us. Yes. I don't collect alms nor am I connected to medicine. But this is important, I must warn you. Please, master. Listen well: Your wife is a white snake spirit. A white snake spirit? Also, her maid is a green snake spirit. Both snakes could be trying to harm you. I don't believe any of this! I'm just a poor man, why do they want to harm me? They've done nothing but good deeds. In fact people call my wife "Empress Bai". Well, that's her bewitching charm. The white snake spirit is very powerful. If you don't leave her, ...you might die. You see, it was fate that brought us together. Follow me to Golden Mountain Temple to become a monk. That way, you can stay alive. I don't aspire to be a monk. Don't be so stubborn! Trouble is upon you. Thanks for your concern, master. I don't believe they are snake spirits. And I don't think they are trying to harm me. Most of all, I don't want to become a monk. Thank you. So you still don't believe me. No, last time I got tricked by ...some Taoist monk. Guess I won't believe any of this again. That Taoist monk must be incompetent. Fine, if you don't believe me, wait till the Dragon Boat Festival; And you'll know it's all true. Amitabha Buddha. High noon sun on Dragon Boat Festival is unbearable, Snakes and insects are in panic. The realgar wine being naturally very potent, Snakes insects will keep at bay or suffer from it. Over here it's the festival preparations, others are in panic. The red sun shines brightly, the scorching heat is unbearable. It's almost noon; you better hide, Qingqing! We'll go through... bliss and misfortune together. I can't leave you on your own. I can't let you suffer all by yourself. I'm more powerful, I think I can handle it. You better go, don't waste anymore time. I want to be here with you. Qingqing. Dear. It's been so busy at work these days, at least we have a day off today. Have a cup of realgar wine, let's celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival. But I can't drink, not at all. Just have a sip, you'll be fine. I'm pregnant, I can't take realgar. That's actually good for you, ...you will be fine. You should have a few drinks too, it's refreshing and it detoxicates. I... I can't drink. Qingqing, watch out. Yes. Dear. I told you I can't drink. Just smell it. No. It smells so good. Very well then, just one sip. Okay. No more. No more. Come on. Are you alright, dear? What's wrong? I... I need to lie down. Dear. You look terrible. Is it nausea? I'm fine. Don't come in, I just need to lie down for a while. My dear, I'm bringing you medicine. Qingqing, my wife needs help. Hurry! Dear. Dear. Take some medicine, you'll feel better. Sister. Sister. Master Xu was frightened to death by you. Where is he? My dear. I wanted to repay you. But I scared you to death It's all because of Monk Fahai. It's his fault. He tried to alienate us. I didn't want you to suspect, that's why I drank the wine unwillingly. This is terrible. Stop crying, don't be sad. We must try to save him. But he's dead. What can bring him back to life? Only the glossy ganoderma, yet it's on the summit of Kunlun Mountain. Thank you for reminding me, I'll go right away. I know the danger I'll face, but for my husband, I must go. After I've got the ganoderma, I'll come back right away. If I'm not back within three days, ...it means that I'm dead. In that case, you must leave after burying my husband. Master Xu, my sister did this for you. She might not live. Qingqing. Sister. I'll be off then. Take care of him. Don't worry. You... just go. Riding the clouds to Mount Kunlun. All for the sake of her beloved. Desperate to bring him back to life, She'll beg for the venerable old man's mercy. How dare you pick-up the ganoderma? Celestial spirits. Please wait, let me explain. You're a thief! What more do you want to say? Stop it... Step back... It's you, White Snake! Please spare me, venerable old man. I'm Bai Suzhen, the sinful. I tried to steal the ganoderma to save my husband. I just hoped to repay him for saving me in past life, and now he's dead because of me. After some thought, I decided to risk by coming here. Please have mercy on me; Allow me to bring this to the mortal world. Trust me, I'm not trying to escape, I don't expect to be spared. I just want to bring my husband to life. Then I'll return for my punishment. I'm willing to die for this. If you want to save your husband, you should have told us first. You've committed a theft, it's hard to talk your way out. She's pregnant, and she didn't mean bad. I'll let her go this time, but this won't be let off again. Give the ganoderma to her, White Crane, Yellow Deer. Thank you! After Bai Suzhen thanked the venerable old man, she left in gratitude. Heading back to the mortal world, she is hurrying home. My dear. You... My dear... My dear. What have you seen? When I brought you the medicine, I saw a big white snake on the bed, ...it was so scary. I've killed the snake, it's hanging on the tree. Do you want to take a look? No. You better go, I don't want you to conjure up crazy stories, go on. Are you still scared? Don't worry, I'll go with you. Alright then, I'll go. There, it's hanging on the tree. Master Xu, look. It's dead. Master Xu. Go back to the room to rest. You're no monster, that monk is full of nonsense. Say, if I was really a monster, will you stop loving me? What are you talking about? We love each other. I don't care if you were a monster. Without affection, human is not as good as a monster. I'm glad to hear that. So you are true to me. Let me tell you the truth now. I'm indeed a snake spirit. You've saved me in your past life, I'm here to repay you. I hoped we can grow old together. That we'll forever live happily. Then came the cold hearted monk Fahai; he just wouldn't give up. I don't want anyone to come between us. I don't want anyone to be in the way. Telling you the truth is my only option. Don't worry. We've been a couple for quite a while, our love is real. We don't need to worry. It doesn't matter whether you're human or a spirit, nothing can come between us. Master Xu. Good day, master. It's fate! Here we meet again. Master. You can't go back, you will only be hurt by the monster. Follow me to Golden Mountain Temple to become a monk. That's your only chance to be saved. Even if my wife is a monster, I'm not scared of her. She's nice to me. She revealed her true form on Dragon Boat Festival, ...and you were scared to death. I'm here to save you. Okay, so I was scared to death on Dragon Boat Festival ...where were you? You weren't there to save me. Instead, my wife risked her life and brought the ganoderma in order to restore my life. That's because I knew it wasn't your time to go yet, ...that's why I wasn't there. Let's not talk about this. Follow me to Golden Mountain Temple to become a monk. I don't want to be a monk. Please let me go home. I've no business with the Buddhist Temple. Please let me go home. Please leave me alone. Master... You're so stubborn. Where's Fashan? Here, master. Master. Bring him back. I don't want to go. I don't want to be a monk. My dear wife, help me! Help me! Did you hear, sister? Qingqing, he kidnapped my husband. Hateful monk Fahai! We haven't done anything wrong to deserve this. Qingqing, we must hurry to the Golden Mountain Temple. Be careful, Qingqing. Monk Fahai is very powerful. I know. "Golden Mountain Temple" Master, please let my husband go. You're a snake spirit yet It's an offence on your part coming to mortal world. You better turn around while you can, ...or you will be punished. Xu Xian was once my savior, I made it up to him by marrying. Please be kind, and let my husband go. How dare you talk about your personal life? This is a Buddhist temple. If I hand Xu Xian over, you will turn him into a monster too. We haven't harmed anyone, what's wrong with me looking for my husband here? And tell me what's your grudge, why are you separating me from my husband? You're a high rank Buddhist monk, you should be kind to all living creatures. Please don't go over the top, you should be more forgiving. I won't be duped by you, there's no use for the pretty speech. Unless you move Yangtze River up here on the mountain, ...you won't see your husband. He is unreasonable, mean and arrogant. Fine, let's do what he wants. We'll move Yangtze River here. Then he'll let Xu Xian go. Amitabha Buddha. Let me go! Sister. Are you alright? It hurts. I think it's time to give birth. What should we do? We're so close to winning. Qingqing, I can't hold up anymore. Sister. We can't stop now, or the water will flow back down, ...and we'll drown. The water! Let's go! Come on. Hurry. Sister. My dear. Xu Xian. And you are? Venerable old man. Please help me. Save my wife. Bai Suzhen has failed in her attempt. Where's my wife? She's hidden in the woods. I'll show you the way. I'll let you two see each other. Thank you, master. Close your eyes. Yes. Qingqing. Sister. My dear... Listen, Qingqing. My dear. My husband is here. Dear wife... My dear. My beloved! Dear wife... My dear husband. Dear wife... My dear husband... Dear wife... My beloved! Dear wife... you... How did you escape? The venerable old man saved me. Sweetheart. Thank you, venerable old man. Hurry, sister. You better hurry. Are you alright? It's all because of you. Qingqing. I cannot believe you. My sister has suffered all because of you. Think it over, Xu Xian. We've risked everything for you. Sister. Dear wife... Move away. Sister... Qingqing... Sister... Dear wife... Don't come any closer. A bit further. A little bit more. Turn your head. Qingqing. Sister... Qingqing. Sister. Dear... My dear wife... Dear. Sister, you have a bonny boy! My dear, you've borne enough hardships... I want to look at my son. Fahai is here, take the baby. Honey Hurry and leave. We'll go through this together, Let's go! You better leave, dear. No. I don't think I can go anywhere. No. Qingqing, you... Take him to Hangzhou, ask my aunt to take care of him. And I'll have an heir, also someone to revenge for me. Listen to me, go now! Or you won't be able to make it. Sister. Leave, Qingqing. Qingqing. For your own personal grudge you stirred up trouble. By drowning Golden Mountain you tried to harm others. You've done the worst crime, what do you have to say now? Why did I do that for? Who's really behind this? I've done serious damage, but you should share the punishment with me. You're a real snake spirit. Still trying to bite at your time of death. I'm generous enough to let you live, so you can live the rest of life in an earthen bowl. She's just given birth. Have mercy on her. Let her go! We'll forever be grateful. She's nothing but a pest. Why won't you give up? You refuse to come to your senses, ...do you really wish to die? You have no conscience. You're the pest. I'm not scared of death. I'll fight you. Dear... Dear... Snake Spirit, you aren't going anywhere. Amitabha Buddha. My dear... My dear... Dear wife... My dear... Leaping out from a foggy cloud of miserable gloom... They soared into a sunny day with gentle breeze. In a different world of emotions. We'll never be apart. Never again shall we be apart.

By the way, Judy, how was the school dance last night? awful, Mother. I had to dance almost every number with my own date. But I thought you liked stanley. He's a big basketball hero, isn't he? "Big" is right. I've got a stiff neck from looking up at him. well, you shouldn't tie yourself down to one boy, anyway. Oh, I'm not, Mother. stanley's only a passing fiance. I'm not really gonna get serious until I'm ready to settle down. You know, say, at 1 6 or 1 7? AII right. There's a button missing. -Button? I didn't see any buttons. -Never mind.

Hey, Mom, can you tie a clove hitch? -Or a "turkey net"? -What's a turkey net? well, that's what you tie around a first-aid victim's neck. If he's got a bloody nose or something. A turkey net. -Oh, you mean a tourniquet. -That's what I said. Oh. No, EIroy, I can't tie those knots. But why don't you ask Daddy? He was a Scout when he was a little boy. He was? would I stop paying? He's my kid. - And there's some stuff about insurance. - Insurance for what? - Anything could happen. - Could get run over tomorrow. - Watch out for a Ford Mondeo. (Romey) And you could get ill. I mean, I'm not starving or penniless but, if you were out of work, I'd need something. It's for Alfred, not me. - Why would I get ill? - lt covers anything. - Like what? - (Romey) Anything. We're not talking mumps, Stuart.

She's really nice. For fuck's sake, tell her you take it up the arse and get out of there! It's my friend, his mother's in hospital. (Horn blares repeatedly) It's the exact opposite of childbirth. First you have the baby, then you get fucked. In some parallel universe, I just met my wife. See that lot in school, all those couples - Robert Coles, Cathy Broderick, that lot - half of them's never done it. Robert Coles was saying, he's desperate. They have a snog and a bit of a thing and that's it. He goes home and has a wank. Town, please. They're just kids, they're just talking. I'm doing it. I'm really doing it! I'm doing it.

We come to a photo where we both go "Phwoar!" And it was Barry Sheene on his bike. In his leathers. God, I'm shamed. It wasn't even black leather, it was red and cream. We're going, "Cor, look at him," and groping ourselves. - Vince gets it out. Not bad, either. - Oh, fuck off. So I'm giving him a wank, nice and slow, looking down at Barry Sheene. - Oh, God, you've had each other! - No. I'm unzipping when his mother comes back in and he jumps up and puts it back in his trousers. - That was it! - lt's not sex if you don't come. When Sheene broke his legs, Vince buys a card from WH Smith and sends it to "Barry Sheene, London." - He was the saddest man on earth. - Barry Sheene? Showing your age. - How old are you? - (Stuart) How old do you think I am? 33? - Fuck off! - What? - l'm 29. - (Phil) Not for much longer. You'll be in the bladder control clinic in six months.

All right, chicken, fuck off home. Oh, yes. (Computer bleeping) Only me, Mum. Oh, give us a beer, love. Look at me, sweating like a pig. He's a wanker though, Stuart. - Every time he does it, I get stuck. - What shift are you on tomorrow? We need a hand with these boxes. Pied Piper have been nagging for these. - Have you seen? Been upgraded. - They're de luxe, with jewellery inside. Look, I nicked one. lt's metal, it's nice. You don't get these in newsagents. No, they're in Kendals, this lot. Vince, you couldn't shift some of your gear in the bedroom, could you? - l'm sort of permanent now. - The Odd Couple, they call us next door. I said more of a dogs' home - waifs and strays. - l wanna put me plants in. Do you mind? - No. I've been meaning to give you some space. - Thanks, Vince, you're a star. - (Hazel) What's Stuart done this time? Nothing. (Buzzer) Come on up. Here y'are. I'm not buying this coffee again, it's like dust. It's still your room. He's just the lodger. Anything for the car-boot sale, shove it on the landing. (Knocking) No, you can't do this, Nathan.

I never promised anyone anything. ted: brian kinney, a father? michael: [ on telephone ] it's true. i was there. i saw it happen with my own eyes. talk about conceiving the inconceivable. or is it the other way around? michael: would you give the guy a break? emmett: [ on telephone ] couldn't be any worse than my daddy was. michael: or mine, not that i can remember him. so what's next? pta parent? little league coach? scoutmaster? they don't allow queers in the scouts. they're afraid we'll induct new recruits. i only go out with men who've already enlisted. so, uh, who's he look like? well, he's got brian's eyes and mouth and... lindsay's nose. well, if he's got melanie's dick, we're in big trouble. [ chuckling ] you should see the pictures i took. he's so adorable. in one of them he's actually playing with himself. who, brian? no, the baby. can you imagine, he's only been in the world about an hour and already he's pulling his pud? excuse me. yeah. can you tell me where men's jockey shorts are? aisle four. thanks. sure. ted: [ on telephone ] well, that proves the theory. we've all got dick on the brain from womb to tomb. emmett: speak for yourself. i am. yeah, go for it. are you watching that filthy web site again? you can't believe this guy. he must be at least 10 inches. ted? ted. uh, can i put you on hold one moment please? yes, mr. wertshafter? have you finished going over the gropnik returns? oh, yes, sir. i just printed them out. there you are. federal and state. thanks. you're welcome... mr. wertshafter. sorry. the boss. shit! you better be careful. oh please, that guy's so blind, he's yet to figure out his wife's been boinking his business partner for the last five years. how he's going to find out about me? i'll catch you later. later. later. michael: [ narrating ] remember that story we all read in high school, you know the one about the prisoners chained in the cave? plato or whoever. all they could see were shadows on a wall, so after a while, they started thinking that was reality. well, in a way, that's what ted's like. it's been so long since he's had sex with some- one he didn't download, he's forgotten that all those perfect bodies and perfect faces aren't real. that no one's really there. that they're only... shadows. then again, whoever got anal warts in a chatroom? woman: michael. [ mouthing silently ] [ chuckle ] [ dropping of baskets ] the difference between our beer and their beer is that our beer says, "sex"... not clydesdales. if you want to be cool, if you want to be popular, if you want to get... laid... this is what you drink. man: what about the model? are you sure he isn't too, um... gay? ladies? woman: i wouldn't care if he was. i'd go to bed with him anyway.

[ snort ] and his body. god! like his body was so amazing. i could see every muscle. he said he wanted to stay inside me forever, and i wanted him to. i still feel him, like, he's still there. christ, daphne, everybody talks about having sex. but i really did it.

[ giggle ] does he love you? he said he did. when? well, when he was about to shoot. he was moving really fast, and he let out this groan like nothing i'd ever heard before. and that's when he said it, right when he came. he said, "i love you." then he leaned in and kissed me. [ clearing of throat ] well, i guess we better be getting back. yeah, i guess so. it's been a pleasure. it can be even more of one. excuse me? [ ? ] you know, i'm never wrong. huh? oh nothing, buddy. i-i don't kiss. yeah, right. [ ? ] mr. novotny? mike. mike. i was wondering if... well, you know those boxes you wanted me to move. mm-hmm. i mean, i don't want to seem like i'm shirking or anything, but they're kind of heavy. do you think one of the guys could maybe give me a hand? yeah, no problem. i can get some- body to help you. oh, that'd be great. okay. i'll be over on aisle 14. okay. okay. woman: yes, your majesty. somebody should tell her princess di is dead, and they're not looking for a replacement. the boxes are heavy. and there's nothing wrong with asking for help. i... i think she's kind of sweet actually. you think she's sweet? well, i don't really know her, but, yeah. what about cute? yeah, she's cute. well, she thinks you're cute too. she... does? she likes you a lot. but she didn't know if you liked her, so i said i'd find out. so you don't really think she's stuck-up. oh, she's adoll. you know, i never heard you say you liked a girl before. well, i... in fact... i've never heard you say anything about girls. you... like girls, don't you? sure. uh... so? then you'll come with us after work tonight. we're taking her out for a drink. i don't think i can. i... ah! no excuses. shoeless joe's, 7:30. and... do something about your hair. it was a trap. hey, see that number in the red shorts? ted: i could work out for 100 years and never look like that. pretending she didn't like her, just to see what i'd say. shawn peters. i went home with him the other night, thinking he was this brutal top. and? and i fell for it! turns out he's a big nelly bottom. i could have told you that. emmett: aw, it's so discouraging. are there no real men left? and now they're expecting me to meet them. in steroid city? no, in this straight bar. is there anyone here listening? there's this new girl at work who's interested in you. fat marley tricked you into meeting her and some of the others for a drink after work, and now you have to go or they might suspect. check out mr. pec-deck. emmett: so what... if they do? they could fire him. or i could end up an assistant manager for the rest of my life. and the solution is to pretend you like pussy? ah, look, he's not like you, okay? what is that supposed to mean? meaning he's not an obviously gay man. are you accusing me of being obvious? if the fuck-me pump fits... well, i could be a... a r-real man, if i wanted to. you know, just lower my voice, stop... gesturing with my hands, make sure my face is expressionless. never, never use words like... like fabulous or divine, talk about, i don't know, nailing bitches and rbis. but i'd rather my flame burn bright, than be some puny, little pilot light. and a fabulous flame it is. thank you. yeah. ted: but michael is out there in the straight world. and believe me, it isn't easy. you do what you have to do. [ panting ] i better go change. for your big date? ooh, here's a sports mag. better bone up. just in case the conversation veers away from liza's weight problem. justin, did you hear me? i said you're not going. [ snort ] i'm going. you were just there last night. so what? so, i was planning to take you and your sister out for pizza. you... you know, i expect you to clean up this mess. i don't understand why you have to spend all your time with daphne. of all the beautiful clothes your father and i bought for you, you have to pick something that no longer fits. that is too tight. that's why. justin? don't i get a kiss goodbye? i expect you to call. we need a secret code word like "shazam", so that if i get in a tight spot, you can come in and rescue me. a tight spot. how about "buttplug"? "buttplug" might be a little hard to work into a conversation. because that's what you are, pretending you're one of them. i couldn't help it. oh, you could have told her the truth, instead of acting like a scared, little faggot. you should have just said, "i take it up the ass, sweetheart. deal with it." right. right. by the way, i noticed you got the jeep repainted. [ deep sigh ] oh my god, this place is like, breeder central. buttplug, butt- plug, buttplug, butt... see you, mikey. [ mixed chatter ] man: i want to watch the end of the game. [ country western ? ] ? won't you be true? ? ? luziette, oh, luziette ? ? girl i love you ? ? something happens to me every time i watch her dance ? ? fiddles play and as she moves... ? marley: michael. michael! where you been? we thought you got lost. some, uh, last- minute business. slide it on in. harv, move your hairy ass. man: [ chuckle ] thanks. what'll you have? uh... same as everybody else. good choice. uh, bring over another pitcher. michael: hi. hi. glad you could make it. i told you he'd be here, didn't i? not to worry? i wasn't worried. now just make sure he's not seeing anyone, before you get all lovey-dovey. [ giggle ] marley, would you shut up and leave 'em alone? what? you're not seeing anyone, are you? me? no. well that's good. i mean... i understand. you don't want to get involved with someone if they're involved already. so are you? seeing anyone? no. we just broke up. oh. sorry. oh, don't be. he was a real doofus. only i didn't know it at the time. there's so much you don't know at the time. isn't that the truth? like, can you believe, he... he didn't even know how to fix a sink? others: [ chuckles of sympathy ] really! woman: he called me at work saying, "what should i do?" i said, "i don't care what you do. buy some cement. get a cork. used chewing gum. but plug it up!" all: [ laughing ] but plug it... [ chuckle ] buttplug... [ helpless laughter ] a million dollars? melanie: that's the general idea. a million fucking dollars? brian, please. you'll wake the baby. well, the answer's no. definitely not. huh, i don't understand the problem. i mean, lindsay told me you offered to help support him. it was very generous. well that's different than a life insurance policy. it's simply in case something happens to you. like i'm decapitated at a railroad crossing? or burned beyond recognition in some gas explosion? you know, i can just imagine the grizzly deaths you've conjured up for me. like in case you get sick. ah. even better. considering your life. i mean, when's the last time you were tested? six months ago. i was negative. that's 26 weeks and 182 one-night stands. you know, i've always admired people who could multiply in their heads. and i'm always careful. look, this isn't for us. it's for our son. we need to make sure he'll be provided for. and all i have to do is die. hopefully not before you sign these papers. all: [ jolly laughter ] we won't be laughing come superbowl time, when we're up against the titans. we don't stand a chance. don't say that. you've got to believe, right, mike? like cher! youwatchfootball? constantly. [ chuckle ] so, uh... what do you think? what do i think? i think... due to free agency, we've lost some of our best players. still, our defence is strong, but we need a new scheme from our defensive coordinator to move the ball. [ chuckle ] that's just what i say. ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. [ ringing of cell phone ] hello, sports fans. i'm coming to get you. it's okay. i'm having a really good time. she's really, really nice. she's really nice? do you think she and her friends would be really nice if they knew the little charade you were playing? they'd probably tie you to a fence and bash your brains in. they're not like that. not like that, huh? listen to me, mikey. are you listening? yeah, i'm listening. there's only two kinds of straight people in this world; the ones that hate you to your face, and the ones that hate you behind your back. now get the fuck out of there... because i need you. [ beep of disconnect ] emmett: ? ...how i was gonna change, but i'm not ? ? if you keep doing things i don't ? ? you better think ? others: ? think ? ? think about what you're trying to do to me, yeah ? ? think ? ? think ? ? let your mind go, let yourself be free ? oh yeah! ? yeah-h-h... ? hi. oh shit, just what i need. what's-his-name. justin. his name's justin. if i can remember it and i didn't even fuck him, why can't you? because i did. so, dawson, how are things down at the creek? crowd: [ cheering ] emmett: thank you, pittsburgh. i love you. you know, for a skinny white boy, i make one fucking fabulous black woman! [ chuckle ] how about another round on me? i got a better idea. let's move on. what's wrong with here? i've had everyone here. yeah, my problem precisely. you haven't had me. oh yeah? what? y-you never told us. there's nothing to tell. we were up in his room. we were 14, 15 tops. [ heavy sigh ] we were supposed to be studying, whatever, only we're not. we're looking at this trashy photo mag his mom swiped from the beauty parlour. anyway... there's this shot of patrick swayze from "dirty dancing"... without his shirt on. ah-h-h. ah-ha-ha! so i've got this hard-on just from looking at it, and i glance over at mikey, and guess what? he's got one too. okay, you can stop now. twin stiffies. i reach over, start rubbing it. he's practically swooning. i pop it out, start stroking it, nice and slow. and we're both this close. then... his mom walks in without knocking. all: [ laughing ] they always do. did she see you? i don't see how she could have missed it. only we didn't come, so it doesn't count. oh, "dirty dancing". that's a really old movie. what? i said that's a really old movie. it's not that old. how old are you? uh-oh. how old do you think i am? 33? [ snort ] [ chuckle ] fuck you! he's 29. and fuck you too. what did you tell him for? fair's fair. we all know what that means. in a few months, you'll be 30. might as well be dead. hmm, well... you ought to know. you already are. oh, ho, ho, ho. michael: oh no you don't. come back here. you're not sticking us with that kid. he's your responsibility. now get back in there. you know, i'm getting a little sick of people telling me what's my responsibility. if lindsay and melanie want to go off and have a kid, that's their responsibility. if what's-his-name-- justin-- wants to go out and pick up guys while he's still in high school, that's his responsibility. my responsibility is to myself. i don't owe anybody a goddamn thing. calm down! i gotta go. emmett: anyone up for babylon? ted: i was thinking boytoy. you know, i haven't been snubbed by a twinkie in weeks. what about him? ted: what about him? well, we can't just leave him here. it's not our problem. he's mine? no, brian's your problem. let him clean up his own mess for a change. don't waste your friday night babysitting. [ ? ] i come all the way here just to see him. he doesn't want anything to do with me. yeah well, the thing you got to know about brian is... he's not your boyfriend. brian doesn't do boyfriends. yeah well, you weren't there when we were doing it. you don't know the things we did... how he kissed me. you don't know anything. i know this. brian is a selfish prick who doesn't care about anyone but himself. if i were you, i'd just forget about him. hi'ya, boys. gettin' any tonight? [ chuckle ] i haven't seen you around here before. he's new. woman: and cute. every guy in the place has his eye on you tonight, sweetheart. michael: can we order? shoot. bet it'll be the first time tonight, am i right? woman: [ chortling ] ha-ha. i'll have the chicken- fried steak. no remarks. and, uh, he'll have a bacon cheeseburger. please. please. you gotta keep your strength up, sunshine. you can't cruise all night on an empty stomach. [ chuckling ] what a freak! yeah, she takes some getting used to, but once you do, can't help but love her. one chicken-fried steak with no remarks, coming up in a flash. thanks, mom. you're welcome, baby. [ embarrassed chuckle ] you're, like, so lucky. i am? your mom's cool about you being gay. if mine found out, she'd kill me. at least it gives her a sense of purpose. i mean, without me she'd be playing bingo instead of organizing pride marches and... handing out condoms. do you need a ride? uh, i borrowed a friend's car. oh, you don't have a little beemer of your own? i'm working on it. just remember what i told you about brian. if he's such a selfish prick, how come you're always following him around? i'm not always following him around. we're best friends. we accept each other for who we are, no judgements, no obligations, no questions asked. you're just waiting for him to finish jerking you off. what? you never got off. that's why you're still hanging around after all these years. go on, chicken. back to your coop. and don't go looking for him. it'll just make things worse. ready, sweetie? did he take off? just as well. he was a little too young for you. hmm. melanie: should i invite my cousin rita? which one's she? you know. the one with the, uh, overbite who never approved of us? oh, her. might as well. she probably won't come anyway. oh... that's my good boy. you know, it's funny. i used to see these women feeding their kids, and i'd think, "ugh, what a turn-off." but watching you... it's beautiful. you can't believe how connected you feel. good night, sweetie. next time, we'll feed him together. you can give him my breast. it's so full. [ sighs of pleasure ] i guess that's all we can do for now. oh, 34 guests. that's a lot. not everyone will show. well, let's hope one in particular doesn't. lindsay: i hope we weren't too hard on him. who? brian? all that talk about the insurance. it almost sounded like we were hoping something might happen to him. we're just being practical. i mean, he's the father, isn't he? it only makes sense that his son should be his beneficiary. [ clatter of typing ] lindsay: i'm just saying maybe we should have waited until he was over the initial shock. huh! what shock? you're the one who gave birth. all he did was show up with his latest trick. at least he showed up. [ scoffing ] christ, it never ceases to amaze me. what? the way you put up with his shit. [ fussing of baby ] shhh. i don't put up with it. like hell. i understand it... him. what? that he's a bigger infant than his son? that he does exactly what he wants. no excuses, no apologies. i've always admired him for that. well, then you can put up with it. i don't have to. come on, let's go back to sleep... for an hour. yes. so, you going out cruising after you drop me off? no. i've been invited to an all-night orgy. whoo! sounds hot. hmm. if you must know, i am going back to my gay apartment, taking off my gay clothes, and getting into my gay bed. you're in a mood. it's goddamn brian. what did he do this time? never mind. i wish you wouldn't let him get to you. but he always does. that's why i keep hoping that you'll meet somebody. why are all the lights on? something must be wrong with vic. vic! baby? is everything all right? just couldn't sleep. hey, mikey. uncle vic. are you in pain? yeah. where? tell me. my wallet. holy shit! what is it? it's the mastercard bill from our... our trip to italy. first-class airline tickets, the excelsior in rome, the diamond and coral earrings i bought you in capri. they're all here. the problem is, so am i. don't say that. it's a miracle you're still alive. it's a miracle how i'm gonna pay for all of this. hustle? both: [ chuckling ] both: [ chuckling ] [ ? ] ? it's you, you, you again ? ? dreamy crush with the sun coming up ? ? glance, look, stare, ? ? stake in my heart, oh-ho-ho ? ? it beats so fast, so fast it stops ? ? ? i think we jam like jell ? jelly baby ? ? come on, make it happen ? ? peach malibu ?

'cause we travel... ? patrick swayze is so hot. i've seen "dirty dancing", like, five times. what i wouldn't give to fuck him. don't say that, brian. you're so pathetic. first i'd unzip his fly. then i'd pull out his king- sized boner. play with it, real slow. oh, yeah? hey, mikey... you have a woodie. i do not. you do too. we'll have to do something about that. [ ? ] ? glance, look, stare ? ? stake in my heart, oh-ho-ho ? ? it beats so fast, so fast it stops ? hi, babe. ma! can't you knock? i forgot to tell you we're having a yard sale, so if you want to throw anything out... oh, don't tell me you still have a crush onhim. i'd fuck you. [ buzzing of doorbell ] top floor. come on up. christ! i'm sorry. i-i don't want to... you can't just drop by unannounced. i just want to talk. there's nothing to talk about. please? i won't stay long. i... i'll just... can i? no. oh, shit. the door was about to shut so i... slipped in. penthouse. not bad. who's this? no one. i have to see you. i'm busy. i don't mind a threesome, although he's kind of young. he's also kind of leaving. who's he? forgive me for not introducing you. justin, this is mr. goodfuk. mr. goodfuk, may i present justin. name is george. sorry. george goodfuk. you don't even know him. well, i was hoping to get to. now why don't you just scamper on home? he's my stalker. that wasn't very kind, sending him off, a kid that age, by himself at this time of night. who are you? father goodfuk? oh, all right. make yourself comfortable. and don't... steal anything. hey. hey! i just left a complete stranger alone in my apartment to come and talk to you, so don't run away from me. we need to get something straight. you don't do boyfriends. oh. mikey's been talking to you. you'll fuck anyone. he's ugly. you don't even know him. and i... i really thoug... justin. i've had you. what happened last night... it was for fun. you wanted me and i wanted you. that's all it was. a fuck? well what did you think it was? look, i don't believe in love. i believe in fucking. it's honest. it's efficient. you get in and out with a maximum of pleasure and a minimum of bullshit. love is some- thing that straight people tell themselves they're in so they can get laid, and then they end up hurting each other, because it was all based on lies to begin with. [ sniffling ] if that's what you want, then go and find yourself a pretty, little girl... and get married. that's not what i want. i want you. you can't have me. i'm too o... you're too young for me. you're 17. i'm 28. 29. all right. 29. all the more reason. now go do your homework. ? well i could sleep forever ? ? but it's of hurt i dream ?

It's an experiment that may win me the Nobel Prize. -What field? -I don't care. The pay's the same. -Is it dangerous? -Oh, my, no. [GRUNTING FROM INSIDE OF BOX] [THUDS] Off we go! Mars University Impressive. In the 20th century... ... wehadno ideaMars had a university. In those days, Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland. Much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable... ... whentheuniversitywas founded in 2636. They planted traditional college foliage: ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the planet was terraformed. -Is it safe to breathe the air? -Of course. Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the western universe. There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity... ... EpsilonRhoRho. You went to college? Of course. I went to bending college. Majored in Bending. -What was your minor? -Robo-American Studies. Are you the moose-head fumigator? No. Actually, I'm an Epsilon from way back. -Close enough. Come on in. -Thanks! Here's your finger back. The coolest robots are in this fraternity.

Don't take this the wrong way, but you don't seem educated. Oh yeah? Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout. Everyone knows 20th-century colleges were really expensive daycare centers. True. By current academic standards, you're a mere high-school dropout. What? ! That's not fair. I deserve the same respect other college dropouts get. By God, I'll enroll at Mars University and drop out all over again! -You won't last two weeks. -Thanks for believing in me. Classmate! What you taking? I don't know. What are you teaching? Same thing I teach every semester: math of quantum neutrino fields. I made it up so no student would dare take it. Math of wonton burrito meals. I'll be there! Please, I don't know how to teach. I'm a professor. See you in class! Oh! [GIGGLING] This is gonna be great. BENDER: Bingo! -Oh, mama! Oh, yeah. Someone's been a bad computer. BENDER: Get a load of that! I say! You've damaged our servants' quarters. And our servants! This time, Robot House has gone too far! Cheese it! Pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds.

I'd rather live in a crate than share a room with this dork. -What makes him talk? -Is he genetically engineered? Oh, please, that's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence lies in his electronium hat. It harnesses sunspot power to produce cognitive radiation. You're wasting your breath. He didn't understand a word. I understood the word "hat.

I prefer banana- flavored energy bars made from tofu. I don't like you. This is gonna be a cakewalk. Welcome to 20th century history.

Whenever a fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. When the campus liquor store's looted, Robot House. -When a human corpse is desecrated-- -I can explain that. That's enough out of you!

Without his hat, he might be no more intelligent than you. -I hate that rodent! -He's my most important experiment. If you don't stop fighting, I'll have you both neutered. That'll show him.

I'll take a picture! Oh! The party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fat-Bot some action! It's my first time. I'm really nervous. Robot House! You were cruel.

Of course I do. I try so hard to fit in... ... butseeingmy parents act like that... ... mademerealizeI'm just a primitive beast. Not everyone turns out like their parents. Look at me. My folks were honest, hardworking people. Besides, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat. So what? I mean, sure, it looks cool, and it makes me smart. But it doesn't make me happy. That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry. They can't. It's all the hat! If you're so miserable, maybe you should go back to the jungle. The jungle. I couldn't do that to the professor. I'm his prize experiment. He's like a father. He's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father. Look at him. I'm so proud. FRY: Thanks, professor. -Not you. [SHOCKS FRY] [JUNGLE MUSIC PLAYS] Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his legs? Oh, poor Guenter. So he just ran away in the middle of the exam? I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with feces. He tied with Fry. I told him to go back to the jungle. You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain? You tried to force Guenter to be a human, but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild, or the circus on a tiny tricycle. Now that's entertainment. But Guenter's better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela. I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion. What we should do is... . -What? -We'll go to the jungle... ... andletGuenterdecide. What? You all know the rules. The winning house becomes Greek Council head. Should that house currently be on any type of multiple secret probation... ... it'llbelifted. And I'll be forced to serve as Grand Marshal of a parade honoring them. I say, Robot House. Your watercraft's as ill-designed as you yourselves. Good one, Chet. Oh, yeah? Watch this! Well, I never! Fraternities, on your marks. Hey! The jungles on Mars look like the jungles on earth. Jungles on earth? I see some movement. I think it's him. Stand back! -Oops. -Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquilizer wears off. There's our man. Professor, offer Guenter the hat. Fry, offer him the banana. He'll choose if he wants to be intelligent or a mindless animal. -Guenter, take the hat. -No, the banana! The banana! The philosophical and metaphysical ramifications-- Banana! Banana! What's that sound? [MUSIC PLAYS] -You sure this is a shortcut? -Not as sure as I was an hour ago. [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] And the winner is... ... RobotHouse? ! Thank God this log is sturdy. Put on the hat! You're the only one who can save us! Stupid monkey. -Not there! -Keep trying! Eureka! The hat goes on the head! It's all so obvious now! Help us, Guenter! My goodness! Hang on! I need to do some calculations! Got it! Grab on! -We're saved! -Appreciate it, Guenter! Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter! Climb up the vine! You can still save yourself. Why bother? I've got nothing to live for. I was miserable as a genius. As a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to wear a hat on my butt. There's just no place for me in this world. Although, on the other hand... . [SCREAMS] Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Let's go gather him up. No sense letting him go to waste. -Guenter, you're alive! -I guess the hat broke my fall. It's working at half capacity. But I can fix it. No, wait! I like it like this! I actually feel sort of... ... happy. But what about your super-intelligence? With that, there was too much pressure. I want to be a moderately intelligent monkey who wears a suit. So I'm transferring to business school! No! Come on, everyone! Keg party in Robot House!

Your Honor, I know the case is closed and you've given a verdict... -... butI wantto testify. -l'll allow it. Miss Leela, on the date in question... ... wereyouor weren'tyou wearing a skirt? That's a dumb question. What matters is Zapp's the worst captain ever. I saw him blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye. -l'd like to cross-examine. -l'll allow it. -We've met before, have we not? -Yes. On that occasion, you had sex with someone? -May I remind you, you're under oath. -Yes. Please point out the person you had sex with. Woo! -And his name is? -Zapp Brannigan. The same man who didn't blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest my case. Jury members, you may begin your deliberations. Your Honor, we have reached a verdict. We find the defendant guilty. Woo! You are hereby stripped of your rank... ... anddismissedfromthe DOOP. I'd like to make one final statement. Kif, come and hold up the flag. Wave it a little, for God's sake. You can take away a man's title and his uniform. But you can't take away his integrity and honor. -Plus, it was Kif's fault. -What? You too are stripped of your rank... ... anddishonorablydischarged. Oh. One day a man has everything. Then he blows up a $400 billion space station. Next he has nothing. Makes you think. -No, it doesn't. -Come, Kif. It's time to begin our life as civilians. That's an order, soldier! ["EVERYBODY'S talkin' " BY HARRY nilsson PLAYS] -Hey, Bender? -Yeah? This is the third hose fight I've broken up. And the second one with real hoses. Move your asses and scrub the ship like I ordered! -You don't have to get so mad. -Fry wiped off some of the dirt. [DOORBELL rings] -Zapp? -l didn't know where else to turn. -You're the only one who loved me. -l never loved you. -Physically. -What is it? Let me work for food. I'll paint, or service you sexually, or mop up. -You can't do any of those things. -Kif might. -Who are you talking to? -Just a hobo who's hit rock bottom... -... andhiscommander. -You're that disgraced captain. He'll distract people from our awful safety record. Come in! I want everyone to meet our new employees. Which ones are new? -The green dude and the fat man. -l haven't seen that robot before. I'm Bender. You know, the lovable rascal. Oh, yes. My good friend, of course. Whoever you all are, I have good news. You have a delivery to Stumbos Four. The gravity is so high... ... youmightbe crushed by your own hair. Enjoy! So, this Leela. I know she's a very sensuous woman. -How is she as a captain? -Really strict. -And mean. -l see. -Does she spank the crew? -No, she just makes us work. Good. But should she ever institute some sort of spanking policy... ... I'llgoforyou.Iwon 'thave my comrades harmed. Hey, this guy's all right! Here's to us poor schmoes working for the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, female man. -l computed our landing coordinates. -Thanks. Very nice work. -Wait, what? -l said, "Very nice work. " This is the happiest day of my life. Okay, crew. You have to deliver these 40 pillows to the hotel. Not heavy, but I'm still complaining. That's because we have an anti-grav pump. Once you're out there, gravity will be very intense. Hey, no prob. This lead apron will protect me. No screw-ups. Use the hover dolly and deliver one pillow at a time. -Let's deliver them all at once! -Yeah! That's using your noodle. Come on, girdle. Hold... . Uh-oh. What the hell happened? Some breaking, involving the dolly. That's all we know. I told you idiots not to overload it. -Each pillow weighs 1 50 lbs. here. -Don't get your panties in a knot. -We'll use the backup. -l'll load pillows. No way. You disobeyed an order... ... sonowyouhavetohand-deliver all 40 pillows. I have a serious question. Does the company that made your bra do girdles? -l ask because a friend-- -Just get to work! -l'm Leela. Get to work. -l agree. The point is, it's just so humiliating working for him. Once he actually ordered me to... ... shavehisarmpitswhile he was in the tub. So, l-- Why don't we talk about something besides Zapp? Oh, all right. Well, how about them, um... . Okay, well, there he was in the tub, right? [THUNDER CRASHES] Some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off. -Ow, ow, ow. -Ow, ow, ow. This is Leela's fault. If she let us use the backup, we'd have broken it and given up. A good captain needs many skills... ... likeboldness,daring, and a velour uniform. I'm not convinced she has any of those. Leela's not too bad. She just makes us work so much. When I was captain, I only wanted my men's loyalty. If I had that, I didn't care if they... ... drankbeerin theirunderwear. -Beer? -Underwear? But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. I'm free! Hear that? I'm actually laughing. This is a mutiny! You're out of here, lady. Zapp's the new captain. All hail the new captain! You're a capable doer of the nasty... -... butI 'mtakingover. -On what grounds, you oaf? Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her in the brig. -What brig? -Then the laundry room... ... whichwillhereafter be called the "brig. " -You don't want me as captain? -Right, genius. -Didn't I do well? -You were mean. You yelled. -You made us work. -A captain needs to do that. -l thought we were friends. -Well... -... youshouldn'thavebeensomean. -Don't worry. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh. Back in uniform. it nearly still fits... ... despitethefatteninghobodiet . -What do I do with these clothes? -Put them in the laundry brig. -Do I have your loyalty? -To the ends of the universe. -Ten hundred percent. -That's not enough. You're to sit and drink until you're as loyal as Kif. -Yes, sir, sir! -May I have a beer, sir? No. You're loyal enough. Meanwhile, I have a plan. We'll attack our archenemy, the Neutral Planet. -Oh, geez. -Once the threat is gone... ... I'llbeaheroand the DOOP will reinstate me. -Sir, that plan makes no sense. -Maybe not to you. But you were court-martialed in disgrace. -Burn! -Nailed you, buddy! Prepare for the fight between good and Neutral. Awesome! We'll be like, pow-pow-pow! And they'll be like... ... andwe'llhavepancakes to celebrate. And I'll be like... . Exactly. Now, in the name of all that is honorable... ... we'llcallthemwitha message of peace, then fire. Yes, sir. Fly the white flag of war. This is Zapp Brannigan, of the ship-- Planet Express Ship. -I come in peace. -Can we trust him, Your Neutralness? All I know is my gut says maybe. BENDER: What now? -We crash into the headquarters... ... killingthemin afirestorm from which nothing can escape. -And then? -Then your mission is complete. I'll already have ejected wearing the only space suit. -Wait. ls this gonna kill us? -Yes. That's what I meant by loyalty. Now help me into the only suit. It's sweaty. You may need baby powder. -We want you back as captain. -Let me guess. He canceled naptime? He ran out of beer? So,
